Such gap\u2010demanding species are absent from lowland rain forests only on the poorest soils where the trees are relatively short, many of the taller trees die standing, and substantial canopy gaps made by tree\u2010fall are few, e.g. in Amazonian caatinga on seasonally waterlogged white sand soils (Coomes & Grubb, 1996) and heath forests on well\u2010drained sands in SE Asia (L. Nagy, personal communication; Ashton, 2013). Gap\u2010demanders depend on rapid growth for their persistence in the community, and this is made difficult when paucity of nutrient supply and/or periodic dry spells combine with root competition in relatively small canopy gaps. The reality of such competition was shown experimentally for Amazonian caatinga by Coomes & Grubb (1998).",

Whitmore (1989) accepted that there are many more individuals of gap\u2010demanding trees in areas with a greater extent of disturbance, e.g. Papua New Guinea compared with Borneo, but emphasized that in both these areas only a small minority of the tree species are gap\u2010demanding for establishment. However, a smaller\u2010scale comparison is informative. Within the island of Borneo there is a strong contrast in the incidence of gap\u2010demanding species between the geologically young area in Brunei where the slopes are steep and landslips are common, and the geologically older Danum area of Sabah with subdued slopes, few strong winds and few tree\u2010fall gaps. In the former area a comparatively large number of gap\u2010demanding species is present in the forest (e.g. at least 11 species of Macaranga) and in the soil seed bank (Mitchell, 1994), while in the latter area there are few gap\u2010demanding species and very little seed of such species in the soil seed bank (Kennedy & Swaine, 1992). This comparison gives support to Denslow's (1987) suggestion.",

WTRF is usually 15\u201340(\u221245) m tall. Almost no tree species have buttress roots, few or none are cauliflorous or ramiflorous (depending on region), and relatively few species (c. 10\u201320%) have compound leaves. In all regions bar East Asia few or no species have leaves or leaflets with drip\u2010tips. The forest contains numerous individuals and species of small trees and treelets and/or herbs (angiosperms or ferns, depending on site). Climbers can be common, but very few species make stems of diameter at breast height (dbh) >10 cm. Vascular epiphytes vary greatly in abundance but in most regions make up only a small biomass. WTRF varies greatly in the role played by conifers, depending on region. In New Zealand and South Africa conifers are among the species reaching the greatest heights and girths; in New Zealand they often form a prominent emergent layer of crowns, and the same is seen locally in South Africa. In eastern Asia only conifers reaching moderate to small size are present. In Chile conifers in the upland part of the core WTRF reach moderate size, and only the species of waterlogged sites attain great heights and girths. In the Azores there is one conifer of moderate height that invades tree\u2010fall gaps. In Australian WTRF no conifer is present. Tree monocots are generally absent. Bamboo is abundant in Chile, but otherwise absent. Tree\u2010ferns are absent in Chile, uncommon in Japan and China, and limited to wetter facies in Australia and South Africa, but are widespread and common in New Zealand.",

The STMRF is similar in structure and physiognomy to the WTRF but \u2013 apart from being exclusively montane \u2013 it generally differs in being richer in bryophytes on the trees and the ground, a result of the frequent cloud cover; the dominant leaf\u2010size class may be microphyll or notophyll (see online Appendix S2).",

Early studies in TLRF emphasized the idea that gap\u2010demanders have smaller seeds on average than shade\u2010tolerators (Swaine & Whitmore, 1988). However, for Japanese WTRF, Kohyama & Grubb (1994) documented a wide range in seed dry mass among shade\u2010tolerators, and the existence of tiny\u2010seeded species that benefit from being able to come to rest in minute \u2018pico\u2010sites\u2019 on steep micro\u2010slopes free of litter. For the same forest Grubb (1996) noted that among gap\u2010demanders the range was narrower because of a lack of tiny\u2010seeded species (<1 mg dry mass), and that the largest\u2010seeded species had seeds a little larger than those of the largest\u2010seeded shade\u2010tolerator. Large seed size in gap\u2010demanders was related to attraction of relatively large animals that disperse the seeds. Does WTRF in other areas contain notably small\u2010seeded shade\u2010tolerators and/or notably large\u2010seeded gap\u2010demanders?",

For Japan Kira (1975) and Yoda (1978) used matched selenium photocells in one type of WTRF (oak\u2010dominated) and found that 0.5\u20131.0% of daylight reached the seedling layer, while Kusumoto (1957) obtained a value of 1\u20132% in another oak stand further north. At one New Zealand WTRF site (35\u00b0S) D.F.R.P. Burslem & P.J. Bellingham (unpublished data) found that seedlings in the deepest shade experienced 1.6% \u2018canopy openness\u2019 (measured using hemispherical photos analysed using GLA 2.0 software; see Frazer, Canham & Lertzman, 1999). At a second New Zealand WTRF site (38\u00b0 S) (Lusk, Duncan & Bellingham, 2009) found that the commonest value for \u2018canopy openness\u2019, measured using Li\u2010Cor \u2018canopy analyzers\u2019 under overcast conditions, was 1\u20132%. This may equate to 1\u20132% penetration of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), but that needs to be checked. For Chilean WTRF the same method was used by Lusk (2002) and Lusk et al. (2008); they found that seedlings in the deepest shade experienced approximately 2% canopy openness. We have not traced any modern measurement of light penetration for WTRF in South Africa, but Phillips (1931, pp. 44\u201345 and 72) reported 1% penetration of diffuse light using Clements's stopwatch photometer method. There appears to be no published work on light penetration in WTRF in Australia. Aschan et al. (1994) reported 2% of PAR penetrating to the forest floor of STMRF on Tenerife (Canary Islands).",

The idea becomes plausible by observations made in other rain forest areas where it has been possible to see primary forest opened up after being hardly impacted by humans until the 20th century.",

The issue was not considered by those who formulated tolerance indices for tree species in northern temperate deciduous forests, e.g. Baker (1945) and Ellenberg (1963). For WTRF some clear examples of the problem are known. At a site in Chile Figueroa & Lusk (2001) reported the mean percentage canopy openness under which the juveniles (up to 1 m tall) of 26 species were found; they showed that both Laureliopsis philippiana and Aextoxicon punctatum were among the most shade\u2010tolerant. However, Veblen, Ashton & Schlegel (1979) found that at a later stage in the life cycle the Laureliopsis needed a canopy gap for onward growth, while the Aextoxicon did not. When we describe species as \u2018strongly shade tolerant\u2019, and assign them to Group 3B, we indicate either an ability to mature in deep shade (relevant to tall shrubs and small trees) or an ability to grow to full height without the formation of a canopy gap above (relevant to medium\u2010height and tall trees).",

Severe cyclones reach New Zealand about every 10 years (Martin & Ogden, 2006), and can cause tree\u2010fall gaps to occur in old\u2010growth forests, sometimes over extensive areas (Conway, 1959; Ogden & Stewart, 1995). The trajectory of extra\u2010tropical cyclones is affected by the phase of the El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Those formed in La Ni\u00f1a years are more likely to track over or close to New Zealand but the strongest cyclones tend to affect New Zealand when the ENSO cycle is between El Ni\u00f1o and La Ni\u00f1a (Sinclair, 2002). Extra\u2010tropical cyclones and other major storms cause local wind and high\u2010intensity rainfall events that result in floods, landslides and tree\u2010falls. Although most of New Zealand is seismically active, the warm temperate zone is generally the least affected by earthquakes (Anderson & Webb, 1994). However, some areas are directly affected by small\u2010scale volcanism (e.g. on and near the Auckland Isthmus) on which primary successions occur (Clarkson, 1990; Smale & Gardner, 1999). Secondary successions after human clearance are widespread throughout much of the region (Wardle, 1991). In New Zealand there has been a very short history of human occupation (only since c. 1280 AD; Wilmshurst et al., 2008). Natural lightning\u2010induced fires were very rare throughout the Holocene and virtually non\u2010existent in the WTRF (Ogden, Basher & McGlone, 1998). Fires caused by volcanic eruptions (Wilmshurst & McGlone, 1996) were also very infrequent and local. Human\u2010induced fire kills almost all the rain forest trees.",

This species is different in nature from any Group 1B species seen in Japan or New Zealand.

The only possible chance otherwise is to establish in a canopy gap in one of the rare years when the bamboo dies all across the landscape. However, observations made in the early 1990s after such a mass death of bamboo showed that the seedlings of bamboo grew faster than those of the Nothofagus obliqua which again succumbed to shading (Gonz\u00e1lez et al., 2002). It is probable that, before the arrival of humans, effective invasion by Nothofagus obliqua occurred most often on landslides, where it may form almost pure stands initially (Veblen & Ashton, 1978; Veblen et al., 1983). This is true even for the coastal regions (Armesto, Mitchell & Villagr\u00e1n, 1986), where the largest earthquakes can have huge impacts (in the last 60 years two had a moment magnitude scale, M\nw > 8; Chapron et al., 2006; Moreno, Rosenau & Oncken, 2010). Nothofagus obliqua probably also invaded land covered in deep ash, and alluvial deposits from catastrophic floods. Veblen et al.

Those found most widely were Eucryphia cordifolia (5/5 sites, sometimes with a higher frequency at a given site than the Group 1 species Nothofagus obliqua) and Lomatia hirsuta (3/5). Of the eight invasive species seven have wind\u2010dispersed seeds; Aristotelia chilensis, being bird\u2010dispersed (Armesto & Rozzi, 1989), is the only exception. The largest\u2010seeded of the seven species are close to Nothofagus obliqua in seed dry mass (Table 4). Veblen & Ashton (1978) emphasized that high dispersibility is not enough to make invasion of young landslides possible, and some species with very small seeds (Dasyphyllum diacanthoides, Laurelia sempervirens, Laureliopsis philippiana and Saxegothaea conspicua) establish only rarely, presumably because of intolerance of the wholly open conditions and/or the nutrient\u2010poor substratum. Vera et al. (2008) found a very high mortality in new germinants of Laureliopsis philippiana when they were grown in open conditions. By contrast, survival was almost 100% under light shade. In the same experiment seedlings of the same age of Aextoxicon punctatum had a very high survival rate under both light regimes.",

The Prunus encroaches strongly on canopy gaps by lateral spread of the crown (P.J. Bellingham and P.J. Grubb, unpublished observations), and was found by Fern\u00e1ndez\u2010Palacios & Ar\u00e9valo (1998) to produce many more effective sprouts than seedlings. Six other Group 3 species have basal sprouting (\u2018suckers\u2019): all four laurels (Apollonias barbujana, Laurus azorica, Ocotea foetens, Persea indica), Ilex perado ssp. platyphylla and (less often) Viburnum rigidum (Fern\u00e1ndez\u2010Palacios & Ar\u00e9valo, 1998; Ar\u00e9valo et al., 1999; Fern\u00e1ndez\u2010Palacios et al., 2004). Ocotea foetens is the rarest of the laurels (Bramwell & Bramwell, 1974), grows tallest and is centred on gulley sites, where it can create deep shade and is often dominant; on Tenerife the stands are typically rich in ferns, of which 15 species were recorded by Rivas\u2010Mart\u00ednez et al. (1993). A single stand on La Palma, described by Lohmeyer & Trautman (1970) was different in kind, having abundant Hedera canariensis on the ground, and only scattered individuals of the few other species. In the experience of A.B. Fern\u00e1ndez\u2010L\u00f3pez (personal communication) four species are particularly shade\u2010tolerant (Table 7).",

Unfortunately for most regions we do not have the data needed to create such an index.

It is significant that the one Group 1A species in our list of core species for the South African WTRF (Zanthoxylum davyi) is much more abundant in STMRF (\u2018Southern Mistbelt Forest\u2019) which occurs on more fertile soils (Mucina et al., 2006). In this forest there is at least one other gap\u2010demanding tree, Ptaeroxylum obliquum (see Geldenhuys, 2010) and the forest is notably subject to invasion by gap\u2010demanding aliens (Rubus spp. and Solanum mauritianum; Mucina et al., 2006).",

We suggest that this is an evolutionary result of the all\u2010pervading presence of bamboos (Chusquea spp.) which invade canopy gaps effectively by vegetative spread, and grow both tall (5 m) and quickly.

This issue is especially important because the area of WTRF in SE Australia has been small throughout the Quaternary, and is thus not a recent phenomenon resulting from human activity (see Kershaw et al., 1991; Byrne et al., 2011). Studies of Mediterranean\u2010type Sclerophyll Forest and STMRF in South Africa yielded only a weak correlation between area of a forest fragment and number of species in it, and a shallow slope for the relationship (Bond & Euston\u2010Brown, 1993; Everard, Midgley & Van Wyk, 1993).

In Japan the WTRF suffers frequent disturbance by strong winds, and significant numbers of landslides. In New Zealand it suffers a lower incidence of strong winds (cyclones on the order of once a decade versus typhoons in Japan every year), and probably about the same incidence (or a lower one) of landslides. There is a lack of comparative data on incidence of landslide formation in New Zealand and Japan, and our expectation is based on the total rainfall, the frequency of very heavy falls and the extent of sloping topography.

However, during the Palaeocene there were present in central Chile two families that are strictly tropical at the present time (Lecythidaceae and Myristicaceae) and there were several that are currently tropical\u2013subtropical in distribution (as defined in Section I): Annonaceae, Arecaceae, Bignoniaceae, Erythroxylaceae and Vochysiaceae plus the sub\u2010families Bombacoideae and Sterculioideae of the Malvaceae (Hinojosa & Villagr\u00e1n, 1997; Villagr\u00e1n & Hinojosa, 1997). A number of these tropical\u2010subtropical families persisted in the Eocene, when there was an increase in the representation of families prominent now in southern temperate forests (Villagr\u00e1n & Hinojosa, 1997; Gay\u00f3, Hinojosa & Villagr\u00e1n, 2005). There was then a decline in the representation of the tropical\u2013subtropical families in the Oligocene and early Miocene, followed by an increase in the mid\u2010Miocene (Hinojosa, 2005).",

As emphasized by Veblen & Ashton (1978), such species must combine ease of dispersal with an ability to grow in the open on a slender nutrient supply. This is especially true of those with very small seeds which fail to compete on roadsides with deeper soils where there is a greater supply of nutrients. The only studies we have found of experimental work on photo\u2010inhibition in species of WTRF are those of Castro\u2010Ar\u00e9valo et al. (2008) and Alberdi et al.

The thermal dissipation of excess energy was saturated at a notably lower irradiance in Lomatia ferruginea than in the other two species, leaving unresolved the leaf\u2010level mechanisms by which this species can be successful in completely open areas. New work is needed to understand its ability to grow and resist photodamage (as judged by leaf colour) in full daylight. A study on three STMRF species in the Canary Islands showed that the gap\u2010demander Morella faya is most resistant to high light, while the shade\u2010tolerant Laurus azorica and Persea indica were successively more sensitive (Gonz\u00e1lez\u2010Rodr\u00edguez et al., 2001).

This point was already appreciated by Glenny (1986), and was independently emphasized by later authors: Kohyama & Grubb (1994), Metcalfe & Grubb (1995) and Grubb (1996). It is notable that in three of the five regions of WTRF the seeds of the smallest\u2010seeded Group 3 core species are smaller than those of the smallest\u2010seeded Group 1 species (Japan, Chile and South Africa; Tables 2, 3, 4 and 5); the same phenomenon is found in SE Australia if the non\u2010core species Eucryphia moorei is admitted (see Section IV.2). Although none of the shade\u2010tolerant trees on the Canary Islands has tiny seeds, one of the widespread shade\u2010tolerant medium\u2010height shrubs (Hypericum grandifolium, 2 m) was found by us to have a mean seed mass of 0.05 mg.

Grubb & Metcalfe (1996) argued that the significance of greater seed mass in shade plants (where it is not primarily an attractant to large animals that disperse the seeds) is that it enables seedlings to emerge through litter, to root down through litter, to resist being scratched out of the soil by litter\u2010feeding birds, to make possible recovery after being partially eaten, to resist more prolonged drought and to compete more effectively for light.",

Together these two effects have the potential to increase the number of canopy gaps invaded. However, it is clear that some gap\u2010demanders have evolved large seeds that are so attractive to disperser animals that they reach many gaps despite their larger size and reduced numbers. Two of the species with the largest seeds in Japanese WTRF are Group 1 species: Aleurites cordata and Sapindus mukorossii (Table 2). Dr T. Riyou (personal communication) found that seeds of Aleurites cordata that have turned black and fallen to the ground are taken by a rat (Rattus sp.), while Professor T. Yumoto (personal communication) suggested that the jungle crow (Corvus macrorhynchos) may also be involved in dispersal. Wakasugi et al. (2001) reported that a murine rat is the major disperser of Sapindus mukorossii. The North American S. drummondii, which also produces large one\u2010seeded fruits, is dispersed by the ringtail, Bassariscus astutus, a member of the racoon family (Procyonidae) (Taylor, 1954). Neither Aleurites cordata nor Sapindus mukorossii was mentioned in the wide\u2010ranging studies of Noma & Yumoto (1997) and Yumoto et al. (1998) on dispersal by birds and by macaque monkeys (Macaca fuscata yakui) on Yakushima.",

The exceptional region is Japan, where Group 2 species have greater seed mass than Group 3 species (unpaired t\n36 = 4.09, P < 0.001; Fig. 5); here the Fagaceae make up 10/25 Group 2 species.

            "text": "\nThere are significant problems in how to make a critical comparison of the different regions of WTRF: differences in the amount and type of research carried out on the light climate and forest dynamics, subjectivity in the classification of species (especially for those in Groups 2 and 3), lack of coverage of differences in regeneration behaviour (e.g. sprouting versus non\u2010sprouting) across the ranges of individual species, cases where human impact has been so great that it is difficult to be sure whether or not the light\u2010demanding tree species common in the forest today had a role in the forest under natural conditions, and most seriously lack of exactly comparable data on gap sizes and proportions of forest area entering the gap phase per unit time as a result of different kinds of disturbance, particularly disturbance events with a longer return time. Nevertheless a worthwhile preliminary analysis is possible because many of the differences among regions in disturbance regime and in proportion of gap\u2010demanding species are quite gross.The incidence of Group 1 species among the core species declines along the following series: Australia 15/21 species, Japan 36/97, Canary Islands 3/14, New Zealand 12/77, South Africa 2/23 and Chile 1/28. The differences between the Australian forest and the forests in New Zealand, South Africa and Chile (but not those in Japan or the Canary Islands) are statistically significant, as are the differences between the Japanese forest and the forests in New Zealand, South Africa and Chile. Some of these differences are consistent with the extent of opening up of the canopy by disturbance events, but we argue that other factors are also involved, and may be more important in some cases: soil infertility, presence of aggressive gap\u2010filling bamboo, limited access during evolutionary time to lineages able to give rise to gap\u2010demanding species, and possibly lack of water in summer.The incidence of Group 2 species among Groups 2 and 3 declines in the series: New Zealand 28/65, Japan 25/61, South Africa 8/21, Chile 5/27, Canary Islands 1/11 and Australia 0/6, but none of the differences is significant.Experiments in Japan and New Zealand show that the proportion of species probably in the \u2018short\u2010term persistent\u2019 soil seed bank is greater for Group 1 species than for Group 2 and Group 3 species, but that some Group 3 species do build up large numbers of persistent seed in the soil. Preliminary studies for WTRF in South Africa and Australia have found only Group 1 species with an appreciable amount of persistent seed, and there may be none in the soil of STMRF in the Canary Islands. Very little is known as yet of the seed bank in Chilean forests.The trees of WTRF in Chile, South Africa and Australia, and of STMRF in the Canary Islands, do not carry significantly larger seeds on taller\u2010growing species. The general trend in WTRF is for the largest mean seed mass to increase with tree height, while there is either no appreciable change in the smallest mean seed mass or it decreases with tree height.The trees of WTRF in Japan and Australia show that light\u2010demanders do not always have on average significantly smaller seeds than shade\u2010tolerators; in WTRF in New Zealand there are significant differences between Group 1 and Group 3 only among the taller species.Outside Japan the only Group 1 species in WTRF with a seed of mean dry mass >100 mg is in Australia, and the only Group 2 species with a mean dry mass >500 mg are in New Zealand and Chile. By contrast, Group 3 species with seed of mean dry mass <1 mg are found in WTRF not only in Japan but also in New Zealand, Chile and Australia, and there are shade\u2010tolerant shrubs with such seeds in STMRF on the Canary Islands. Evolution of gap\u2010demanding species with large seeds (dependent on dispersal by larger animals) has been much less common than evolution of shade\u2010tolerant species with very small seeds (dependent on exploitation of specialized micro\u2010sites in adequately moist regions).\n",
