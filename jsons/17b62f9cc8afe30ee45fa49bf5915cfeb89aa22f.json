With apologies to those who understand biochemistry, oxygenation is the addition of O 2 to a solution and oxidation is the chemical combination of O 2 with another atom (or the removal of electrons from an atom). O 2 is important from the beginning of vine growing to the making of wine. By using the energy of sunlight, vines can convert carbon dioxide and water into carbohydrates and oxygen in a process called photosynthesis. Photosynthesis takes place in the leaves of the vine.",

            "text": "The role of O 2 in winemaking happens in two different ways at two different stages: Early on it allows the yeast to grow successfully, and later on, it allows the wine to develop and maturate during the aging process. Yeast cells (on the grape skin) need to be healthy during fermentation but the high levels of sugar when the grapes are first crushed may be toxic. Yeasts can produce Hydrogen Sulfide (H 2 S) which masks the fruit flavours in the wine and makes it appear harsh. O 2 added to the fermenting must (freshly crushed grape juice that contains the skins, seeds, and stems of the fruit) helps to limit the harmful effects of H 2 S by raising the 'redox potential' of the wine (balance between H 2 S and available O 2 ). O 2 can also help to stabilise the colour in red wine and to make tannins more rounded. It is up to the winemaker to decide which technique of adding O 2 to use to integrate into the vineyard's fermentation process. The level of free H 2 S in a wine or must does not keep a wine from taking up O 2 but helps to deal with the potentially negative secondary effects (eg. browning and microbial contamination). O 2 can also be quite useful in both ros\u00e9 and white winemaking. The amount of O 2 added however is much less than in making red wine.",

The process normally occurs in multiple treatments that can either be one or two treatments during the early stages of fermentation or more prolonged treatment during the maturation period that can last for 4-8 months. This technique is favoured by large producers, sometimes combined with oak chips [7] but not used much by small producers because of the high cost of the equipment (personal communication from Leon Femfert, Fattoria Nittardi, Tuscany, Italy).",
