The development of rapid DNA sequencing methods based on the selective incorporation of chain-terminating dideoxynucleotides ([1]; later termed \u201cfirst-generation sequencing technologies\u201d) and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) DNA amplification technologies ([2]; reviewed in [3]) has paved the way for the study of biological and evolutionary processes at the molecular level. Such technologies have been extensively applied to the diagnosis and molecular epidemiology of infectious diseases of livestock and become important tools for targeted research on host-pathogen interactions. The most recent versions of these first-generation sequencing technologies are widely accessible and provide high-quality data. However, their application to projects such as whole genome sequencing is expensive and time-consuming, often requiring prior knowledge of the target genome for specific template amplification. These limitations have been particularly problematic for large sequencing projects and have motivated the development of alternative, post-Sanger sequencing technologies (\u201cnext-generation sequencing\u201d or NGS).",

Over the last 5\u20137 years, all of the major platforms have made significant improvements, with notable advancements made in terms of protocol complexity, overall performance (including read length, fidelity, lower input DNA), and cost efficiency. More recently, smaller benchtop sequencers [7] have become available, making the technology more accessible for use in routine microbiology laboratories, while academic core facilities and commercial service providers focused increasingly upon providing users with access to a wider diversity of the sequencing technologies available. These developments will bring NGS technologies within the reach of many more research groups and diagnostic laboratories where NGS analysis of a single isolate will generate significant quantities of data, many orders of magnitude greater than that generated by other typing methods.",

These approaches promise additional advantages such as scalability, simplicity, long read length, and low operational costs and do not require clonal amplification of template DNA molecules, thereby removing potential errors associated with clonal amplification. A single third-generation platform is currently available on the market since 2011 (PacBio, Pacific Biosciences) that sequences long single DNA molecules in real time, known as SMRT sequencing. Other technologies are still under development (e.g., [4]) such as DNA sequencing in nanopores that offer the potential of simple, inexpensive, single-molecule sequencing in miniaturized or highly scalable devices [9].

            "text": "Several processes in the NGS workflow, from sample selection to data interpretation, are potentially vulnerable to bias and/or error introduction (Fig. 1). This includes the error rates of the sequencing chemistry and library construction, as well as point mutations and insertions/deletions that may arise during reverse transcription and PCR amplification. The amplification of DNA by PCR to obtain clonal template sequences is subject to error introduction [8] and may result in an amplification bias impacting the relative frequency of sequence variants present in the sample. Sampling bias can be introduced when a relatively small number of samples are analyzed per epidemiological unit (e.g., single animal or herd) due to financial constraints restricting the thorough use of NGS. When only a small proportion of the nucleic acids in a single sample are subjected to sequence analysis, technical sampling bias occurs. While NGS data provides a high resolution of an individual sample, the resolution of higher epidemiological scales (Fig. 2) may thus be compromised due to insufficient sampling. Moreover, as a minimum amount of genetic material is needed as input for NGS workflows, this can result in bias towards samples with the highest pathogen titers. Errors and bias may also be introduced by methods to increase the sensitivity of the workflow, such as targeted pathogen genome amplification [10\u201312] or enrichment (e.g., [13]). Furthermore, reagent contamination has been reported to interfere with metagenomic analyses [14, 15]. Errors can also be made during the sequencing process itself via base miscalls by NGS machines. For example, the loss of synchronicity (dephasing) in a percentage of the clonally amplified DNA template [16] results in increased noise and sequencing errors [17, 8]. Each of the different NGS platforms available has its own distinct characteristics in terms of read and error profiles, with the Illumina platform often regarded as having the lowest error rate, while other platforms can produce longer reads [7, 18, 19]. In addition, certain biases and errors can be introduced during the analysis of NGS datasets, due to the limitations of the algorithms or reference data used [20, 21]. For example, genomic repeat regions are a well-known problem for sequence assembly algorithms [22]. However, software advancements combined with platform and chemistry developments are expected to further reduce operational costs, error rates, and input DNA quantities, allowing more careful sampling strategies and reducing experimentally introduced error and bias in the future.\n\n\n",

This includes sequence filtering (removing low-quality sequences) and alignment followed by variant calling and error correction. Discriminating true biological variants from those due to experimental noise is an important issue when trying to identify low-frequency variants in a population, for example, in viral quasispecies or metagenomic analyses, and there are currently a number of bioinformatics tools to aid in this (e.g., [23\u201326, 19]). Currently, a multitude of software has been developed to address different aspects of NGS analyses [27, 28]. However, the available algorithms for both genome assembly and amplicon analysis can present some limitations [29], meaning that custom-made scripting and in-house resolution of bioinformatic problems are often needed to investigate novel datasets and specific hypotheses. In this context, researchers are frequently faced with the need to acquire computer skills and bioinformatics expertise. To evaluate the potential of NGS for a wider group of scientists and diagnosticians, there is a real need to develop flexible and practical bioinformatics workflows that can provide user-friendly tools for the analysis of massive datasets and that become publicly available. Although some software with a menu-driven approach is available (e.g., Geneious, CLC Workbench, Galaxy), most applications are optimized on UNIX-based operating systems and require some bioinformatics expertise. Although less user-friendly, UNIX-based pipelines are typically freely available to the NGS user community and are equipped with algorithms that track the high pace of innovation in the NGS field.",

Although limited datasets (e.g., resulting from the desktop-range 2nd-generation sequencers) can be managed using modest computing resources, like high-end desktop computers running virtual Linux machines [4], larger datasets typically require high-performance computational clusters, which present a considerable investment and require sufficient information technology (IT) support. Cloud computational resources (i.e., renting time from commercial high-performance computational clusters) may be a solution [30] although further developments are needed, given the data transfer issues resulting from huge file sizes [4]. Another issue for diagnostic laboratories is protection of data from unauthorized access, which cannot be guaranteed in the cloud, as data from diagnostic examinations need to be kept confidential. For labs frequently producing NGS data, data storage and backup costs can be substantial. Ideally, these huge genetic datasets should be made publicly available to the scientific community as they provide a source of information applicable to better understanding disease, design of targeted assays, systems biology, and integrated OMICS analysis approaches. To this end, online repositories such as the Sequence Read Archive (SRA; [31]) have been created to store both raw NGS and intermediate analysis files.",

The high plasticity of some microbial genomes, with large mobile elements, gene-coding plasmids, chromosomal genes, and regions of extensive genetic variability, can frequently complicate genome assembly [46]. While most viral genomes are significantly smaller than their bacterial counterparts, the viral replication biology (particularly that of RNA viruses) poses its own unique problems. These involve the inherent variability of many viral genomes due to replication machinery lacking efficient proofreading mechanisms. This, combined with a short generation time and high replication rate, results in a complex mix of differing genomes (a \u201cswarm\u201d of closely related viruses) within a single host that are often termed as \u201cquasispecies,\u201d reviewed in [47].

Wright and colleagues investigated the genetic diversity and resulting quasispecies population after inoculation of foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) into a single animal and identified genetically distinct populations originating from different lesions [50]. Morelli and colleagues [51] studied the evolution of FMDV intra-sample sequence diversity during serial transmission in bovine hosts, providing novel insights into the fine-scale evolution of an RNA virus. NGS can also provide insights on microevolutionary processes of viruses at different scales, including the fine-point resolution molecular epidemiology analysis of outbreaks [52].",

For example, Lef\u00e9bure and colleagues [64] used NGS to study genome complexity and horizontal gene transfer in foodborne Campylobacter spp. Biek et al. [65] studied local transmission patterns of Mycobacterium bovis in cattle and wildlife reservoirs using whole genome sequences from 31 samples originating on five farms. These demonstrated enough diversity between individual outbreaks to determine evolutionary variation down to herd level. The identification of novel antimicrobial resistance genes in the foodborne pathogen Campylobacter coli [66] was possible using NGS, and the application of NGS technologies during a recent crisis involving foodborne enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O104:H4 allowed a swift genomic identification [67] that was key to the management of this crisis. Finally, the technology also proved very informative to study the molecular epidemiology and evolutionary history of extremely monomorphic Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides SC [68] in addition to studies tracing medically significant pathogens [69\u201371]. Samples from the US 2006\u20132007 West Nile virus (WNV) outbreak in birds were characterized using Illumina sequencing, resulting in the identification of a new genetic variant containing a 13-nucleotide indel [72]. A survey of Chinese domestic fowl using RNA-Seq on an Ion Torrent identified a novel Coronavirus, providing insights into the diversity and distribution of avian coronaviruses [73]. A further study has also investigated the role of Usutu virus in causing epizootic infection in blackbirds in Germany [74].",

For instance, the unbiased characterization of conserved bacterial ribosomal RNA-encoding sequences (rRNA profiling) has been applicable to whole microbial community characterization (e.g., [94, 95]) and to molecular characterization of (uncultured) bacteria [96]. Metagenomics is the determination of the sequence content of a complete microbial community (reviewed in [97]). The analysis of the resulting data can be taxonomy oriented (identification and quantification of species diversity; [98]) or function based (identification of coding gene diversity, e.g., [99]). The latter has significant potential, e.g., in the screening for virulence-associated, antibiotic resistance genes, and vitamin production-associated genes in microbial communities [100]. NGS also offers the potential of unbiased sequencing of the nucleic acid content of a sample and has been applied to the characterization of the viral metagenome in samples [101] or the identification of unknown or unexpected viruses in diseased animals or insect vectors. Furthermore, metagenomic NGS workflows allow the study of the interaction of treatment with an animal\u2019s microbiome [102]. In the microbiology lab, NGS has the potential for greater diagnostic resolution than any other typing method, and clinical microbiology labs are currently investigating its potential for routine diagnosis [103, 104].",

Although the common goal is to identify potential pathogens, the studies can roughly be divided into three categories: (1) investigations of outbreaks of unknown etiology, (2) investigations of well-known disorders presumed to be of multifactorial etiology, and (3) metagenomic studies of reservoir species and vectors. Examples of the first category include the identification of a novel Orthobunyavirus affecting cattle (described in more detail below), an astrovirus in the brain of farmed minks suffering from encephalomyelitis [110], and a novel picornavirus as candidate etiologic agent for turkey viral hepatitis [111], among others. The second category encompasses investigations aimed at finding contributing infectious agents to complex diseases, such as colony collapse disorder of honey bees [112, 113] and postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome in pigs [114]. Studies in the third category have been performed on diverse animal species suspected to be important reservoirs, such as bats [115, 116], African bush pigs [117], and red fox [118], as well as typical vector organisms, such as ticks [119].",

It is therefore necessary to use a synergistic approach combining molecular diagnostic tools, such as NGS-based metagenomics and follow-up PCR-based assays targeting detected pathogen sequences, with more conventional diagnostic methods, including isolation and characterization. This is crucially important in situations where metagenomic data indicate the potential presence of multiple pathogens. While PCR-based prevalence studies in matching disease cases and healthy controls can provide further evidence for disease association, isolation of candidate pathogens is required to assign causality by addressing Koch\u2019s postulates [120]. The assembled data from such a multidisciplinary (pathology, epidemiology, metagenomic data, PCR prevalence studies, isolation, characterization, etc.) should be used to identify the most likely candidate etiologic agent and to make informed intervention decisions. The synergetic and parallel use of molecular and classical methods not only results in detection of infectious agents and development of targeted diagnostic tests but also has the potential to make isolates or strains available shortly after the occurrence of outbreaks. The availability of isolates or strains is of special importance to allow the design of effective vaccines or antimicrobial drugs.",

Metagenomics, using 454 technology, allowed the identification of a novel virus, subsequently named Schmallenberg virus (SBV), in an epidemiological cluster of diseased cattle in Germany [121]. These viral sequences were used to rapidly design targeted molecular tests that were used to confirm a clear association between the presence of the virus and affected animals [110]. International adoption of these molecular tests identified a widespread occurrence of SBV in European countries (http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/supporting/pub/429e.htm) and its detection in stillborn and malformed lambs [122, 123], as well in insect vectors [124, 125]. The molecular tests were also helpful in targeting samples for isolation of the virus, which ultimately led to the development of a prototype vaccine currently under evaluation [126].",

Nordentoft and colleagues [134] used NGS metagenomics to study the influence of livestock management parameters and infection with Salmonella enteritidis on the microbial community in the chicken intestinal tract. Another study [135] documented the effect of Campylobacter jejuni infection on the chicken fecal microbiome. The application of metagenomic techniques in poultry production could lead to the development of novel alternatives to antibiotic growth promoters and better understanding of the colonization of food production animals by foodborne pathogens such as Salmonella enterica and Campylobacter spp. [36]. Other studies investigated the host response to pathogen infection. Glass and colleagues [136] used NGS transcriptomics to document bovine resistance and tolerance traits to parasitic infection. The technology was also used to study the ferret transcriptome response to influenza infection [137], the chicken transcriptome response to Marek\u2019s disease [138], the swine response to porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus infection [139], and the changes in the mouse transcriptome after Brucella sp. infection [140].",

Their characterization contributes to better understanding the complex biology of pathogens. Wang and coworkers [141] characterized microRNA sequences from Orientobilharzia turkestanicum, a fluke with zoonotic potential infecting sheep, and identified key target miRNAs for parasite energy metabolism, transcription initiation factors, signal transduction, and growth factor receptors. Virus-encoded microRNAs (vmiRNA) regulating viral or cellular transcripts can be targeted for virus discovery [142, 143]. miRNAs also play important roles in regulating host-pathogen interactions. NGS has been applied to investigate whether infection can modulate miRNA biogenesis and has also been used to identify miRNAs that influence pathogen replication, tropism, and pathogenic potential [144\u2013149]. In particular, cellular miRNAs have been shown to interact with the viral genomic RNA or mRNA, facilitating or inhibiting the virus life cycle. These molecules have demonstrated immense potential as a source of antiviral therapeutics effective against a number of viruses (adenovirus, rabies, Venezuelan equine encephalitis, porcine reproductive and syndrome virus [150\u2013153]) or for the design of live-attenuated virus vaccine based on miRNA-mediated gene silencing [154, 155, 147].",
