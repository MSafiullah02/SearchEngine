Reference stocks of variola virus are currently maintained in WHO licensed repositories at the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention (CDC), Atlanta and Vector Laboratories, Novosibirsk. There is no information on possible unlicensed stocks that may be held elsewhere in the world, however the deliberate releases of a virulent anthrax strain in the USA in 2001 has highlighted the hazards that unlicensed stocks may represent. Today the majority of children and adults are not vaccinated against smallpox, and the consequences of a re-emergence of variola virus, by whatever means, would be far reaching without effective public health interventions (Gani and Leach, 2001, Meltzer et al., 2001).",

Laboratory diagnosis of smallpox can take several days if virus culturing is performed requiring biosafety level IV laboratories. A simple, reliable and sensitive diagnostic assay would offer improvement for effective medical and public health countermeasures in the event of a release. The first genetic techniques employed for specific identification of variola virus utilised restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLP) of viral genomic DNA (Mackett and Archard, 1979, Esposito and Knight, 1985, Dumbell et al., 1999). This approach has been used extensively to differentiate between other Orthopoxvirus (OPV) species including vaccinia, cowpox, camelpox, monkeypox, mousepox or ectromelia viruses and for other members of the genus. RFLP of genomic DNA requires lengthy virus culture to generate suitable quantities of high quality DNA. Today, PCR based methods offer considerable improvement in sensitivity and specificity for diagnosis and the subsequent sequencing of a large number of Orthopoxvirus genomes (Goebel et al., 1990, Smith et al., 1991, Massung et al., 1994, Shchelkunov, 1995, Antoine et al., 1998; Shchelkunov et al., 1998, Shchelkunov et al., 2000, Shchelkunov et al., 2002; Gubser and Smith, 2002, Afonso et al., 2002), has significantly increased the potential for developing new genetic based assays.",

Rapid assays based on fluorogenic Taqman PCR of the HA gene have demonstrated the utility of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) for Orthopoxvirus identification (Ibrahim et al., 1997, Ibrahim et al., 1998; Sofi Ibrahim et al., 2003).

            "text": "A variola-specific PCR assay was described that could differentiate between variola major and alastrim minor isolates based on the size of the amplified product (Knight et al., 1995). However, a recent evaluation of this PCR revealed that a subset of cowpox viruses also produced amplicons of the same size described for variola minor strains (Meyer et al., 2002). Consequently, more sequence information on variola, vaccinia, cowpox, camelpox and monkeypox virus isolates is required to demonstrate the existence of species-specific sequences. Studies of Orthopoxvirus species to date have shown that unique genes are very rare, (Shchelkunov et al., 1998, Shchelkunov et al., 2000, Shchelkunov et al., 2002) but species-specific SNPs are frequently observed in most genes. We have sequenced several genes from a large collection of Orthopoxviruses to identify virus specific polymorphisms and have observed that SNPs are usually the only reliable genetic elements for virus identification (Pulford et al., 2002). Frequently no restricticion endonucleases exist that can exploit these unique markers by RFLP. To test this hypothesis, we constructed PCR assays based upon the amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS) (Newton et al., 1989) which is a sensitive technique for interrogating single base pair differences between DNA templates. ARMS has been used to detect a number of different variants of the hepatitis B virus (Gramegna et al., 1993, Liang et al., 1994) as well as identify genetic profiles of virulent, attenuated or vaccine strains of transmissible gastroenteritis virus and porcine respiratory coronavirus (Lai et al., 1995). Using a modification of ARMS we have developed novel gel based single-tube assays which not only detect Old World Orthopoxviruses, but are also specific for variola virus. These multiplex assays employ three primers; two consensus primers generate an amplicon diagnostic of an Old World Orthopoxvirus and the third primer simultaneously binds to a variola-specific polymorphism and initiates extension of a shorter PCR product to detect the presence of variola virus. Examination of amplified PCR products by agarose gel electrophoresis allows the distinction of one (Orthopoxvirus present) or two (variola virus detected) PCR products. We show here the examination of these assays with DNA samples from an extensive panel including 43 variola and 50 other Orthopoxvirus isolates.",

The A13L-3 primer utilised two variola unique polymorphisms in close proximity and introduced a mismatch base A\u2192G to generate further instability at the primer 3\u2032-end (Table 2). This primer produced a characteristic 416 bp amplicon with variola virus DNA (Fig. 3, lane 1) in the ARMS assay. Priming events from Orthopoxvirus genomes other than variola virus were inhibited strongly by this cluster of three non-matched bases at the 3\u2032-end of the A13L3 oligonucleotide primer making it highly specific.",

However, the incorporation of a mis-match base into the variola-specific primers reduces their binding energy and subsequently the efficiency of product amplification (Fig. 4). The A13L multiplex also revealed minor \u223c1100 bp bands on gels with samples containing variola virus DNA only (Fig. 4). The size of this extra band corresponds to the sum of the consensus and specific products together, and may represent a heteroduplex. The production of potential minor heteroduplex complexes was also observed for other multiplex assays we performed (not shown) which may be the result of the repetitive sequence elements identified in the A13L orthologs (Pulford et al., 2002). Orthopoxvirus genes frequently contain repetitive sequence elements (Massung et al., 1996). Consequently, the structural characteristics of this sequence might explain the low abundance of variola virus specific products in the A13L-3 multiplex assays.",
