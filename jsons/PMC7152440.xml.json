The National Nanotechnology Initiative and ASTM International have defined nanotechnology as a term that refers to technologies that manufacture and manipulate materials with a dimension between 1 and 100 nm to exploit their novel properties. They are expanding the design, characterization, synthesis, limitations, toxicity, and applications of nanomaterials (Khajeh et al., 2013, Kaur et al., 2014). Further, nanostructure is defined as a specified structural object with at least one dimension equal to or smaller than 100 nm. A wide variety of nanostructures have been identified, e.g., nanopores, nanorods, nanowires, nanoribbons, nanotubes, and nanoscaffolds (Wu et al., 2016, Yohan and Chithrani, 2014). The most promising features of these structures are their size-dependent properties. They are also known as nanoparticles (Samarasekera et al., 2015, Premnath et al., 2015).",

In addition, they have a wide range of applications in the fields of biology and medicine (Sun et al., 2015). The term \u201cnanotechnology\u201d was first introduced by Professor Norio Taniguchi of the Tokyo Science University, in 1974. He described nanotechnology as the processing, separation, consolidation, and deformation of materials by one atom or by one molecule (Mulvaney, 2015). The European Science Foundation defines nanomedicine as \u201cThe science and technology of diagnosing, treating and preventing disease and traumatic injury, of relieving pain, and of preserving and improving human health, using molecular tools and molecular knowledge of the human body\u201d (Satalkar et al., 2015). The first therapeutic nanoparticle, i.e., albumin-entrapped paclitaxel (Abraxane), was successfully used as an anticancer nanomedicine (Gupta et al., 2014, Matsumura, 2014). The applications of nanoparticles in the medical field are described as diagnostics, drug carriers, drug delivery vehicles, and therapeutic agents (Rakesh et al., 2015, Khan et al., 2015). This review focuses on the prospects of nanostructured nanoparticles and nanomedicine as antimicrobial agents in the possible management of neuroinfectious diseases associated with neurodegenerative disorders.",

They occur when a pathogen (i.e., virus, bacterium, fungus, or parasite) and its proteins enter into the body and affect a specific organ, tissue, or system or the whole body (Huh and Kwon, 2011). They are also called communicable diseases because of their capacity to transfer from one person to another, e.g., malaria or tuberculosis, or one species to another, e.g., influenza (Rothman et al., 2006). Infectious diseases are broadly classified as: (1) old, generally well-known diseases, e.g., dengue, malaria, and tuberculosis; (2) new, previously unknown diseases, e.g., severe acute respiratory syndrome; and (3) diseases known to threaten in the near future, e.g., avian influenza (Pigott et al., 2015). Infection is the process of pathogenicity when a microbe enters with the capacity to induce damage or disease, at either a local or a systemic level, in the host organism. It may be an acute (with a short duration and severe course) or chronic (low grade and long lasting) infection. Neuroinfection is a major harmful condition of the nervous system and it induces neurodegenerative processes that lead to neurological disorders (Thakur and Zunt, 2015).",

            "text": "Some antimicrobial agents are hydrophilic in nature and are unable to enter into the microbial cells. In addition, the internalized antimicrobial molecules are rapidly degraded by lysosomal activity, which leads to reduced antimicrobial activity of the drug (Park et al., 2015, Parida et al., 2015). Therefore, the new technology is expected to release the antimicrobial drug within the microbial cells. It may be through the drug delivery system using passive action on infected cells via the mononuclear phagocytic system, which may enhance the therapeutic index of the antimicrobial along with a reduction in side effects (Park et al., 2015). In addition, the systemic administration of antimicrobials affects the host system. Therefore, nanoparticles and nanomedicine are the future of antimicrobial therapy because they produce cell- and target-specific actions in the nanoscale range without alteration of host cell functions (Yang et al., 2010, Basnet and Skalko-Basnet, 2013). Regarding bacterial infections, the development of resistance against antibiotics is the major problem in antimicrobial therapy (Basnet and Skalko-Basnet, 2013). Resistance to antibiotics occurs for the following three reasons: (1) modification of the active sites of drug-binding proteins, (2) destruction or modification of the antibiotic by the enzymatic mechanisms of the organism, and (3) activation of the efflux mechanism for the antibiotic by the organism (Borges-Walmsley et al., 2003, Arenz and Wilson, 2016).",

Therefore, nanoparticles have greater potential to eliminate the microbes and avoid the development of resistance (Pelgrift and Friedman, 2013, Leid et al., 2012). However, the mutation of some Mycobacterium to resist silver nanoparticles that are loaded with isoniazid has been documented. However, this resistance occurs only with silver nanoparticles, whereas CuSO4 and ZnSO4 particles do not produce the microbial resistance (Larimer et al., 2014). In addition, antimicrobial-loaded nanoparticles enter into host cells, including in the brain region, via the endocytosis process followed by the release of preloaded drugs in the microbes (Martins et al., 2013). A nanoparticulate system shows enormous potential in targeted drug delivery, especially in neuroinfective conditions of the brain (Leite et al., 2015b). However, the implementation of nanomedicine in neuroinfectious diseases for antimicrobial therapy has significant challenges. Generally, a drug delivery system should have multifunctional actions, i.e., \u201cswitch on\u201d and \u201cswitch off\u201d functions when required. And, these multifunctional drug delivery systems must be harmonized in an optimal fashion (Gendelman et al., 2015, Singh et al., 2010). Nanoparticle-assisted antimicrobial drug delivery is challenged to produce improved efficacy and avoidance of resistance and it is extremely desired in the treatment of neuroinfective disease (Garg et al., 2015b).",

Antimicrobial nanoparticles possess six major properties supporting their use in the clinical setting. They are as follows: (1) the surface properties of nanoparticles can be changed for targeted drug delivery. In this case, small molecules, proteins, peptides, and nucleic acids, loaded into nanoparticles are not rejected by the immune system and effectively reach the target site of the specialized tissue (Boraschi et al., 2012); (2) nanocarriers support the solubility or stability of the drug in the targeted cells and minimize the side effects in the host cells (Singh, 2010); (3) nanotechnology allows the codelivery of two or more drugs in the form of combination therapy against multiple pathogens (Singh et al., 2014, Hu et al., 2010); (4) antimicrobial nanoparticles potentially can overcome microbial resistance, which is common in bacterial organisms (Garg et al., 2015b); (5) the administration of antimicrobial drug-loaded nanoparticles enhances the therapeutic index, with extended half-life in the systemic circulation leading to the controlled release of the microbial drug and improving the overall pharmacokinetics (Bisht and Maitra, 2009, Chen et al., 2015); and (6) the administration of antimicrobial drug-loaded nanoparticles is possible via different routes such as oral, nasal, parenteral, and intraocular (Fonseca-Santos et al., 2015, Almeida et al., 2015). Therefore, there is great interest in developing antimicrobial nanoparticles as newer methods of drug therapy for neuroinfectious disease.",

            "text": "Various nanostructures are designed to develop nanoparticles and nanomedicines. In the medical system, they are widely used in diagnosis and as drug delivery systems for cancer treatment. Various nanomaterials, like Au, Ag, ZnO, Cu/CuO, TiO2, Al2O3, and CeO2, are used in nanomedicine for exploring their antimicrobial activity (Ge et al., 2011, Fu et al., 2012). These nanoparticles have unique physicochemical properties, e.g., ultrasmall size (less than 100 nm), controllable size, large surface area-to-mass ratio, high reactivity, no solubility, and target-specific actions. These properties of nanoparticles allow them to act as nanomedicines because the size of natural functional units in living organisms, like DNA (2 nm), small RNAs, ribosomes (20 nm), microtubules (25 nm), nuclear pores (50 nm), and various proteins and lipids is equal to or less than 100 nm (Wang and Wang, 2014, Shang et al., 2014, Matea et al., 2015). Further, it is significant that innovative nanoparticles can overcome the limitations of traditional diagnostic and therapeutic agents. Furthermore, the small size of nanoparticles provides extreme mobility and capacity to interact with the biological system (Saptarshi et al., 2013). However, some research studies have suggested that smaller nanoparticles are expected to produce toxicity because of their higher reactivity with various biological proteins and peptides (Mu et al., 2014, Zaman et al., 2014). This property of nanoparticles has raised safety issues with nanomedicine (Yang et al., 2010). In fact, initial findings revealed that nanoparticles can easily penetrate and propagate in living organisms. A comparative study showed potential benefits in the diagnosis and cure of diseases without risk to the immune system, lungs, digestive mucosa, and skin. The primary goal of nanoparticles in medicine is to design target- and site-specific delivery systems with an accurate therapeutic dose (Wang et al., 2013a). In 2013, a biodegradable polymers was used for the delivery of drugs to a specific location owing to its potential inherent capacity (Marin et al., 2013). This phenomenon attracted great interest in creating a revolution for the usage of nanomedicine in the field of pharmaceutical sciences.",

The combined action of gold nanoparticles and laser irradiation is useful in the controlled release of drugs (Mieszawska et al., 2013). The gold nanoshell\u2013antibody complex is known to produce an ameliorative effect in cancer disease due to its selective transportation of drugs into cancer cell nuclei with conjugation of arginine\u2013glycine\u2013aspartic acid peptide and polyethylene glycol (Austin et al., 2014). In contrast, it produces hyperthermia when using noninvasive radio frequency for tumor cells (Gannon et al., 2008, Raoof and Curley, 2011, Chatterjee et al., 2011). The silver-coated nanoparticle is one of the major nanoparticles in antimicrobial action. Various nanosized particles have been considered as novel antibacterial agents because of their high surface area and reactivity. The antimicrobial activity of nanostructured nanoparticles with conventional antimicrobial agents is enhanced compared to regular antimicrobial agents (Beyth et al., 2015). In addition, they are also shown to produce potent antimicrobial actions by inhibition of microbial growth and reproduction. This property is higher in silver-decorated polymer micelles and polymeric vesicles, antimicrobial polymer micelles and vesicles, and antimicrobial peptide-based vesicles (Suchomel et al., 2015, Chen et al., 2014a).",

They have various unique properties like biocompatibility, intrinsic ability to enhance magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast, and capacity for surface modification that leads to enhanced tumor imaging activity (Wang et al., 2013b). The standard-size nanoparticles are composed of ferric (Fe3+) and ferrous (Fe2+) iron (Wahajuddin and Arora, 2012). They have been trapped in the reticuloendothelial system through endocytosis or phagocytosis to explore their cytotoxicity profile due to the dissolving capacity of iron oxide under acidic conditions (Singh et al., 2010, Liu et al., 2013a). In addition, Fe3+ ions can be stored in adult humans, accumulating up to 3\u20135 g of iron. Therefore, the solubility of the iron oxide nanoparticle is negligible and it avoids metal toxicity (Wells et al., 2012, Yen et al., 2013). For MRI of the cellular system, iron oxide nanoparticles are coated with contrast agents such as sugars, e.g., dextran, or synthetic polymers, e.g., silicone (Ciobanu et al., 2012). In addition, it also reported to produce limited toxicity compared other nanoparticles.",

            "text": "Rare earth materials, e.g., lanthanides and silica materials, are also used for the preparation of nanoparticles. The lanthanides are excellent building blocks of multimodal imaging probes and have luminescent and magnetic properties (Heffern et al., 2014). Gadolinium (Gd3+) has seven unpaired electrons and it shows a high paramagnetic relaxivity. Therefore, it is also used in the imaging system for MRI (Shen et al., 2013). Other doped lanthanides, e.g., NaYF4 nanoparticles, are also used with Yb3+ and Er3+ particles (Liu et al., 2013d, Wang et al., 2014a). There is great interest in silica nanoparticles for the cancer cell imaging system because of their favorable properties; for example, they are inert, optically transparent, and easy to modify in structure and size. The hydrophilic surface of nanoparticles with silanol (\u2013Si\u2013OH) and deprotonated silanol (\u2013Si\u2013O\u2013) groups is prepared at neutral pH and this makes the silica nanoparticles dispersible in water (Lee et al., 2010, Yang et al., 2014). It enhances the specific binding property of silica nanoparticles at targeted sites and avoids the aggregation of silica nanoparticles in vivo. In addition, silica nanoparticles are quite photostable with fluorescent dyes and reduce the photochemical oxidation by reactive oxygen species (Vatansever et al., 2013, Zhao et al., 2014b). Other silica materials, e.g., mesoporous ones, have great structural control and functionalization (magnetism and luminescence) properties due to their large surface area, high pore volume, nontoxicity, and good biocompatibility. And they are proven to be effective as a drug delivery system (Bharti et al., 2015). Moreover, mesoporous silica nanoparticles are also used for the radionuclide imaging process with labeling of radioisotopes (Xing et al., 2014).",

The drug-loading processes in polymeric nanoparticles are entrapment, encapsulation, and dissolution or dispersion. These particles are used for the loading of a wide variety of hydrophobic and hydrophilic drugs (Nitta and Numata, 2013, Zhao et al., 2013). This formulation is widely used for drug delivery, tissue engineering, and various biomedical applications. Furthermore, the surface of these polymeric nanoparticles contains various functional groups and can be modified for targeting ligands (Elsabahy and Wooley, 2012). Clinically, the conjugation of the polymer\u2013drug has an important role in drug efficacy and reduction of dosing frequency of conventional medicines (Eliasof et al., 2013). These particles are providing greater efficacy to antiasthmatic (Lu et al., 2014), antituberculosis (Smith, 2011), pulmonary hypertension (Yin et al., 2013, Agyare and Kandimalla, 2014), and anticancer drugs (Woo et al., 2012). In contrast, there is no report on the biodegradability and toxicity of polymeric nanoparticles in pulmonary formulations (Marin et al., 2013). Research has found that typical ceramic nanoparticles such as silica and alumina also have potential drug delivery properties (Fine et al., 2013). In addition, the newer biodegradable synthetic polymers and natural modified polymers such as chitosan and albumin are also involved in drug delivery systems (Lohcharoenkal et al., 2014, Wang et al., 2011a). Furthermore, cytolytic peptide nanoparticles (\u201cNanoBees\u201d) and polymeric nanoparticles encapsulating curcumin are used for cancer treatment in humans (Ray et al., 2011).",

The widely used solid-lipid nanoparticles are glyce behenate, glycerol palmitostearate, lecithin, triglycerides, and tristearin glyceride (Santo et al., 2013). In this case, a large amount of surfactants is needed for the stability of the formulation. These particles are used for the preparation of proteins and antigens for therapeutic purposes (Sahdev et al., 2014, Taki and Smooker, 2015). This formulation produces good anticancer and antiviral potency (Torrecilla et al., 2014, Yu et al., 2012). In addition, entrapment of a drug in solid-lipid nanoparticles has a potential penetration property (4\u201311 times that of traditional delivery) through the blood\u2013brain barrier and it can treat the various central nervous system disorders (\u00dcner and Yener, 2007, Liu et al., 2014c). Formulations of indomethacin, ketoprofen, isoniazid, pyrazinamide, and primaquine with solid-lipid nanoparticles have been reported to produce beneficial effects in the pulmonary, hematological, and gastrointestinal systems (Mansour et al., 2009, Omwoyo et al., 2014). The major limitation of this preparation is loading efficiency, owing to the formation of a lipid crystal matrix and changes in the physical state of the lipids (Valetti et al., 2013).",

These particles allow the loading of lead compounds on both sides, i.e., the inside and outside interfaces of the ferritin nanoparticles. The outer surface of ferritin particles can be modified by chemical or genetic materials and the cavity of the ferritin particles is able to carry a wide range of metals with high affinities (Theil, 2013). Ferritin nanoparticles have been applied to carry a biovector on their surface and reach the target of C32 melanoma cancer cells (Xing et al., 2014, Zhen et al., 2013a). In addition, gadolinium-loaded ferritin nanoparticles have entered a specific tumor of the endothelial cells (Kitagawa et al., 2012). They are stable at pH 7.4. Therefore, they possess rigidness under physiological conditions and are easily broken down in an acidic environment (Lin et al., 2011). Hence, they can be useful for target-specific action in the diagnosis and treatment of tumors and cancer cells.",

These liposomal nanoparticles are frequently used for the delivery of antimicrobial drugs (Kraft et al., 2014, Monteiro et al., 2014). Drug-loaded liposomes can be prepared according to the size range of the macrophage. These liposomes can be digested within the macrophage's phagosome by the phagocytosis process and release their drug contents (Schwendener, 2014, Whittenton et al., 2013). In addition, their liposomal membranes can also be incorporated with opsonins, which can activate endocytosis in other cell types. The major distinguishing feature of liposomes is their lipid bilayer structure that mimics the cell membranes of infectious microbes and can readily fuse with them (Gao et al., 2014, Wang et al., 2015, Oh and Park, 2014). Owing to this property, they play a great role in the delivery of antimicrobial drugs directly inside of microbes.",

            "text": "The nanopore is a member of the nanoparticles and is a nanoscale-level channel or hole in a free-standing membrane. Solid-state nanopores such as silicon, SiO2, and Si3N4 act as biological sensors of biological transmembrane proteins (Haque et al., 2013, Majd et al., 2010). The \u03b1-hemolysin (\u03b1-HL) channel is one of the common nanoparticles used to detect single-stranded nucleic acids. A modified \u03b1-HL nanopore was used to distinguish the individual DNA mononucleotides (Wanunu, 2012). It revealed that nanopores serve as potent regulators of DNA because of their direct sequencing action on single molecules of DNA (Haque et al., 2013). And it is a reliable and low-cost nanoparticle for the DNA sequencing process in genomic research. A similar property is also expected to regulate the genetic information of cancer cells (Wang et al., 2011b). In addition, polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) polymer has been used to produce microfluidic channels and microscale devices (Valencia et al., 2012). Briefly, this nanoscale device was prepared by sealing with PDMS polymer. It consists of two reservoirs connected by a pore of glass material and it is filled with an ionic solution. The potential difference across the pore was measured at constant applied current by a four-point technique (Jain et al., 2013, Liu et al., 2013b). The working principle of the nanopore device is that the flow of DNA molecules passing through the pore creates a downward spike wave in the current recording profile. Each downward peak mimics the movement of a single DNA molecule in the nanopore device. This nanopore device helps to detect viruses and their viral proteins (Crick et al., 2015, Dorfman et al., 2013). Furthermore, it has been attached to the biological membrane with a covalent bond and acts as a probe molecule for detection of specific target sites. The nanopore supports the detection of antigen\u2013antibody binding reactions (Schibel and Ervin, 2014). Antibody was specifically bound to the colloidal surface of the nanopore and raised the diameter of the nanoparticle. A limitation arises in this material owing to significant current blockade and higher resistance in the current flow due to the larger diameter of the colloidal particles (Belkin et al., 2015). This device is used to detect the presence of Streptococcus group A, and the sensitivity of detection is four times faster than standard latex agglutination assay (Zhu et al., 2015). The major advantages of nanopores are the cost-effectiveness, simplicity, speed, and versatility of nanopore assays (Squires et al., 2015). Therefore, this particle can be useful for the preparation of nanomedical devices for the diagnosis and treatment of neurological disorders.",

Graphene is one of the nanosheet materials and it is arranged as a two-dimensional honeycomb crystal structure of a flat monolayer of carbon atoms (Song et al., 2014). It has high thermal conductivity (\u223c5000 W/m K), high specific surface area, high electron mobility (250,000 cm2/V s), biocompatibility, and thermal stability. Therefore, it is used for electrochemical immunosensors for the diagnosis of disease (Wang et al., 2012c, Zhu et al., 2015). The graphene oxide nanosheet (GO-nS) is used to detect in vivo cellular interactions and DNA cargo functions (Shen et al., 2012). The interaction of fluorescence-labeled GO-nS and DNA molecules produces an aptamer/GO-nS complex and it is used as a real-time biosensing platform of living cells. This fluorescence-labeled ATP-binding aptamer (FAM-aptamer) can potentially be used in a biosensing system with GO-nS owing to its three basic actions, i.e., (1) high fluorescence quenching efficiency in vivo, (2) potent DNA transport action, and (3) efficient protection of oligonucleotides from enzymatic cleavage (Hong et al., 2012, Sanchez et al., 2012). In addition, the FAM-aptamer/GO-nS complex has high ATP specificity and sensitivity with a wide detection range, i.e., from 10 \u03bcM to 2.5 mM in vitro (Wu et al., 2015a). Therefore, this nanoparticle also expected to serve as a molecular tool for the diagnosis of genetic disease.",

            "text": "Dendrimers are well-structured globular macromolecules and they have three regions: (1) a core, (2) layers of branched repeating units, and (3) functional end groups on the outer layer of the repeating units (Bumb et al., 2010). The highly branched nature of dendrimers provides a large surface area and allows them to react with microorganisms in vivo (Shao et al., 2011). Dendrimers with drug molecules are prepared by either complexation or encapsulation. They allow loading of both hydrophobic and hydrophilic agents. Hydrophobic drugs can be loaded inside the cavity in the hydrophobic core, whereas hydrophilic drugs are attached to the multivalent surfaces of dendrimers through covalent conjugation or electrostatic interactions. This formulation can be used for oral, transdermal, ocular, and intravenous routes of drug delivery (Madaan et al., 2014, Yavuz et al., 2013). In addition, dendrimers have been shown to cross cell barriers by paracellular and transcellular pathways (Wu et al., 2013, Jones et al., 2012). The polyamidoamine dendrimers are most widely used for drug delivery because of their potential action of facilitating transport through the epithelial barrier (Xu et al., 2014, Tyssen et al., 2010). However, polyamidoamine dendrimers affect the function of platelets (Jones et al., 2012). The structure\u2013activity relationship of dendrimers revealed that they have a dual action on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and herpes simplex virus (HSV), i.e., virucidal action on HSV and viral entry inhibitory action on HIV (Tyssen et al., 2010). In addition, they carry siRNA and deliver it to a specific target site for the silencing of gene sequence (Wu et al., 2013). They have great potential drug delivering capacity in the CNS (Xu et al., 2014). Therefore, dendrimer particles can be useful for the delivery of siRNA in gene therapy as well as in nanomedicine for neuroinfectious disorders. A summary of various nanoparticles and their applications has been tabulated in Table 6.1\n.",

The partitioning capacity depends upon the polar and nonpolar properties of the drugs. Lipophilic molecules bypass this obstacle because they have a potent membrane permeativity via diffusion (Mu et al., 2014). Nanoparticles are able to mask the therapeutic agent and provide efficient delivery into the cytosolic region. Nanoparticles are involved in the endocytosis process by natural phagocytosis, pinocytosis, and receptor-mediated endocytosis (Oh and Park, 2014). Phagocytosis involves the ingestion of materials up to 10 \u03bcm in diameter by a few cells of the reticuloendothelial system, e.g., macrophages, neutrophils, and dendritic cells. It is an uptake mechanism by almost all cell types and normally it involves the submicrometer range of material or substances in solution (Kruth, 2011). Larger microparticles enter into the cytosol by the action of phagocytic cells, whereas nanoparticles cross into all types of cell.",

            "text": "Receptor-mediated endocytosis has potential selectivity in the entry of molecules into cellular target sites. The nanoparticle surface binds to the extracellular surface and the cell allows carrying the ligands into the cytosolic region (Wang et al., 2012a). Sometimes, it transduces the signal to the intracellular space and triggers various biochemical pathways. Furthermore, it may also enhance the internalization of the ligand and its nanoparticle via the endocytosis process. This process is potentiated by biomolecules such as caveolin and clathrin (Rattanapinyopituk et al., 2014, Smith et al., 2012). The cross-linking of receptors and nanoparticles is more prone to membrane enfolding and reunification leading to the formation of an endosome. Nanoparticles between 25 and 50 nm in size are involved in this kind of entry into the cellular system (El-Sayed and Harashima, 2013, Steketee et al., 2011). Cellular endocytosis follows five steps to carry the nanoparticle with ligands into the cytosolic region. The steps are as follows: (1) association of nanoparticles with receptors on the cell membrane, (2) internalization of nanoparticles with ligands, (3) release of ligands (also known as endosomal escape) from nanoparticles by the endolysosomal process or lysosomal degradation of nanoparticles, (4) interaction of free ligands (therapeutic agent) with cytoplasmic organelles or proteins, and (5) exocytosis of nanoparticles via the endosomal recycling process (Xu et al., 2013, Herd et al., 2013, Serda et al., 2010, Strobel et al., 2015). A summary of nanoparticle entry and elimination in the cellular system is illustrated in Fig. 6.2\n.",

In addition, they have a strong fluorescent property under ultraviolet light illumination. The major application of QDs is to image tissues and cells, e.g., lymph nodes and tumors (Helle et al., 2012). However, the other types of nanoparticles possess superparamagnetic iron oxide potential; therefore they are recognized to detect cancer cells and their progression such as in prostate cancer (Sterenczak et al., 2012). Furthermore, gold and silver nanoparticles are very commonly used for the diagnosis of various cancer cell types such as skin, ovarian, pancreatic, breast, and lung cancer (Austin et al., 2014, Patra et al., 2010, Swanner et al., 2015).",

            "text": "The delivery of drugs in the CNS is challenging because of the arrangement of the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB). Generally, the physiological barrier limits the brain's uptake of neurotherapeutic agents and neuroimaging contrast agents (Ashton et al., 2015). Anatomical and cellular manifestations of the CNS, such as the neurovascular capillary of endothelial cells, pinocytosis, and tight junctions, limit drug delivery. The brain microvasculature has four types of cells, i.e., endothelial cells, pericytes, astrocyte foot processes, and nerve endings, which contribute to the modulation of drug delivery in the CNS and prevent drug entry into the brain (Shilo et al., 2015, Gomes et al., 2014). In this case, lipid-mediated free diffusion and receptor-mediated endocytosis have a great role in the entry of molecules into the CNS. Therefore, lipid-derived nanoparticles like liposomes have contributed to the great success of drug delivery in the neurological system (Fonseca-Santos et al., 2015, Fiandaca et al., 2011). Current investigation is focused on the delivery of nanostructured medicines in the treatment of neurological and neuroinfectious diseases such as glioblastoma, dementia, AD, PD, and ALS (Fonseca-Santos et al., 2015, Ramos-Cabrer and Campos, 2013). The current concept of drug delivery in the CNS is focusing on low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles. The size of natural LDL particles is 22\u201327 nm in diameter, with a core of lipids, e.g., cholesteryl esters, with small amounts of triglyceride (Feng and Mumper, 2013, McMahon et al., 2015). Plasma-derived LDLs are used to deliver nanomedicines for neurological tumors (glioblastoma). Synthetic LDL nanoparticles also provide the efficient delivery of paclitaxel for glioblastoma (Feng and Mumper, 2013).",

The utilization of taxol-loaded albumin nanoparticles limits the restenotic response in experimental animals (Chan et al., 2011).",

The nanoparticle has a great potential to regulate microbes with antimicrobial agents (Dur\u00e1n et al., 2010). Nanoparticles are able to cross the CNS and alter the neurological proteins (Upadhyay, 2014). Based on this evidence they are expected to control the various neurological diseases. Conventional medicine is limited in treating neurodegenerative diseases by the difficulty of drug delivery and the toxicity profile of neurological as well as systemic organs (Carroll et al., 2010, Chhabra et al., 2015, Perreault et al., 2012, Singh and Ramarao, 2013). Therefore, nanoparticles and nanomedicine are a promising technology for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders. However, the experimental and clinical evidence exploring the role of nanomedicine in the treatment of neurodegenerative disease is limited. In contrast to their possible benefits, various nanoparticles are metallic in nature and metal compounds are well documented to produce neurological damage (Willhite et al., 2014). Chelators are reported to reduce the metal compounds associated with neuronal damage (Zhang et al., 2013b, Zhao et al., 2014a). On the other hand, metal chelators, e.g., desferrioxamine, exhibit serious neurotoxicity and neurological changes due to strong covalent binding properties with membrane proteins (Olivieri et al., 1986, Kapoor, 2013). LDL-receptor-targeted polymeric nanoparticles can potentially cross the BBB or be taken up by the brain endothelial cells and deliver drugs to the brain. And, they effectively mask the covalent bonds of chelators and facilitate the delivery of drugs and minimization of toxicity (Kreuter, 2013). Therefore, nanoparticles can play the significant role in the management of neurodegenerative disease.",

The usage of polymeric nanoparticles has demonstrated that they are potentially noninvasive drug carriers that can cross the BBB and enter into the brain (Ong et al., 2014, Patel et al., 2014). The antitubercular drug-loaded nanoparticle has the capacity to enter into the Mycobacterium tuberculosis organism and produce a potent efficacy against tuberculosis (TB) (Garg et al., 2015a, Pandey et al., 2003). The oral administration (five oral doses every 10 days) of coencapsulated poly(dl-lactide-co-glycolide) nanoparticles with antitubercular drugs (e.g., rifampin, isoniazid, and pyrazinamide) produces complete bacterial clearance from the organs compared to conventional TB drugs in mice and guinea pigs (Pandey et al., 2003, Sharma et al., 2004).",

Generally, they play roles in central sensitization and protect the CNS, whereas overactivation of these cells is responsible for changes to the neurological function and at the extreme stage can cause neurodegeneration (Jungner et al., 2016). The abnormal activation of these cells is due to various internal and external factors such as stress, drugs, chemicals, trauma, surgery, heat, hormones, microbes, and peripheral nerve injury (Alizadeh et al., 2015, Goncharenko et al., 2014, Lee et al., 2015, Matilla-Due\u00f1as et al., 2014, Villanueva et al., 2013). The mechanism of neurodegeneration takes place via the release of various proinflammatory cytokines (tumor necrosis factor and leukotrienes), excitatory neurotransmitters (glutamate and aspartate), and oxidative stress in the neurons (Camara-Lemarroy et al., 2012, Wang et al., 2012b, Ramesh et al., 2013). The endothelium of the CNS is the primary target site for neuroinfection and neuroinflammation (Di Marco et al., 2015). Changes in the central endothelium affect neurological function via activation of neuronal glial cells, and at the chronic stage it undergoes the enhancement of neurodegeneration (Loane et al., 2014). Infectious agents cause neuroinflammation by affecting the endothelium of the cerebral blood vessels and astrocytes (Combes et al., 2012, Freeman et al., 2014).",

Encephalitis is another neuroinflammatory condition of the CNS and it is caused by enteroviruses (herpes simplex), rabies virus, and arboviruses (Nile virus). The virus particle is most prone to causing neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration (Kurkowska-Jastrzebska et al., 2013, Richie and Josephson, 2015). Generally, viruses are able to infiltrate the nervous system. The entry of the virus particle into the nervous system involves two methods, i.e., transneuronal and hematogenous spreading methods (Chaves et al., 2011, Coller and Smith, 2008, Taylor and Enquist, 2015).",

            "text": "The exact mechanism of transneuronal spreading of viruses is not known yet. But it is expected to involve the virus and its proteins escaping from the immune system by traveling via the axons of the nerves (Feldman et al., 2014, Rall et al., 1995, Turner et al., 2014). In the hematogenous spreading method, the virus uses one of two main ways to enter into the brain. The first way is to infect an immune cell; thereafter, the infected immune cell carries the virus into the nervous tissue, for example, infection of B cells by John Cunningham virus (a type of human polyomavirus) and infection of CD4 T cells and macrophages by HIV (Chapagain and Nerurkar, 2010, Tebas et al., 2014). The second way is to cross the blood capillaries, similar to free virus or leukocyte entry (Roe et al., 2014). Furthermore, neurons lack essential molecules for the binding of killer cells with viral peptides on the viral surface. Therefore, the neuron is a safe house in which the virus can replicate (Deauvieau et al., 2016, Voss and Bryceson, 2015). Once a virus infects a neuron it can persist for the lifetime of the host. Further, it interferes with the function of neurons and their homeostasis of the nervous system, leading to the generation of neuronal damage and neurodegeneration (De Chiara et al., 2012). The infective agents affect the neurological system and cause neurodegenerative diseases such as AD, PD, and ALS (Alkhawajah et al., 2015, Bourgade et al., 2015, DeVaughn et al., 2015, Wu et al., 2015b). Further, progressive infective neurodegeneration occurs with a wide range of molecular and cellular mechanisms leading to deterioration or loss of neurons in the CNS.",

It also affects the peripheral nervous system and it enhances neuronal inflammation and neurodegeneration (Ramesh et al., 2013, Wada et al., 2013). This leads to peripheral neuropathy. Peripheral neuropathy mainly develops from infection with herpes varicella zoster (called shingles), HSV, or cytomegaloviruses (Guedon et al., 2015, Muneshige et al., 2003, Sansone and Sansone, 2014). Epstein\u2013Barr virus and West Nile virus do not play a role in the development of peripheral neuropathy. Viral infections are able to affect the nervous system and cause severe damage to the sensory and motor nerves leading to sharp and severe pain (Chikakiyo et al., 2005, Jo et al., 2013, Kokotis et al., 2013). Moreover, infection with West Nile virus, which occurs through mosquitoes, causes severe motor neuropathy along with various forms of inflammatory neuropathies. Infection of postherpetic neuralgia is also shown to produce long-lasting and intense pain after an attack of shingles (Sansone and Sansone, 2014). HIV infection-associated neuropathy shows different forms depending on the nerves affected and the specific stage of active HIV disease (Kokotis et al., 2013). Furthermore, bacteria can attack nervous tissue, causing peripheral nerve damage and neuropathic pain. Such bacterial infections are diphtheria, leprosy, and Lyme disease (Benoliel et al., 1999, Reis et al., 2014, Zimering et al., 2014). In addition, the tick-borne infection also contributes to neuroinfection-associated neuropathic pain. It is a rapidly developing infection that progresses to painful polyneuropathy that occurs within a few weeks of infection (Logigian and Steere, 1992, Zimering et al., 2014). Therefore, the prevention of neuronal infection may be a promising approach in the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders.",

Further, they can release their cargo material and control the ongoing disease progress by clearing microbial infections, repairing the neuronal system, eliminating proinflammatory mediators, and inducing the antiinflammatory response (Raymond et al., 2015).

In addition, they are also targeted to the receptors of monocytes/macrophages, such as the folate, CD4, mannose, and CD44 receptors, to enhance cellular uptake of the nanomedicine for macrophage-based drug delivery in the brain via the BBB (Irvine et al., 2015). The nanomedicine follows six steps to eliminate microbes from the nervous system and other biological systems (Hollmann et al., 2015). After entry of the nanomedicine into the nervous system it attracts and binds to the microbes. Thereafter, it carries out the following steps: (1) it destroys the peptidoglycan (membrane) layer of the microbe, leading to the control of microbial growth; (2) it releases toxic metal ions into the cytosolic region of the microbe and can cause microbial death; (3) it alters the cellular ionic environment by activating the proton efflux pumps, leading to a change in pH; (4) it enhances the generation of free radicals, especially reactive oxygen species (ROS), leading to raised oxidative stress; (5) it damages the genetic material of the microbial organism, thus stopping the regulation of microbial growth and replication; and (6) it reduces ATP production, thus increasing energy demand and controlling microbial growth and proliferation (Rizzello et al., 2013, Upadya et al., 2011, Watkins et al., 2015, Shah et al., 2015). The molecular mechanism of nanomedicine for the elimination of microbes from the nervous system is illustrated in Fig. 6.4\n.",

Therefore, the potential usage of nanostructured nanoparticles and nanomedicines remains questionable because of their potential toxicity, clinical efficacy, and adverse side effects (Baeza-Squiban, 2014, Krishnaraj et al., 2016, Walters et al., 2014). And, scientific studies need to explore their complete safety and efficacy in humans. Further, studies on their bioavailability, biotransformation, environmental toxicity, etc., are needed (Battani et al., 2014, Walters et al., 2014). The true applications of nanoparticles for the treatment of disease require improvement in the specific formulations, more safety and efficacy, and minimized cellular toxicity. The opinion of toxicologists is that new science, methods, and protocols are needed with a higher safety profile for the utilization of nanoparticles and nanomedicines (Hofmann-Amtenbrink et al., 2015).",

As of this writing, the study of nanoparticles is lacking a basic understanding of nanoparticle pharmacokinetic behavior in biological systems, especially the distribution and biotransformation of nanoparticles at the organ and cellular levels. Because nanoparticles are very small sized particles, they may change bodily functions, pass through the BBB, and trigger abnormal blood coagulation pathways. The nanoparticles must be degraded without the development of harmful effects in animals, plants, and environmental natural resources.

Mainly nanotoxicological studies are intended to determine the extent to which the toxic properties threaten the environment and human beings (Guadagnini et al., 2015). The types of toxic exposure of nanoparticle are as follows: (1) consumer exposure\u2014usage of nanoparticle-containing personal care products, cosmetics, sunscreen preparations; (2) occupational exposure\u2014for workers in nanomaterial manufacturing and research; (3) environmental exposure\u2014the increasing concentrations of nanomaterials in groundwater and soil may produce a significant environmental risk (Malysheva et al., 2015). Moreover, the toxicity of nanomaterials is broadly classified into two areas: (1) biological toxicity and (2) environmental toxicity. In biological systems, the nanostructured nanoparticles enter the body via six principle routes, i.e., oral, intravenous, dermal, subcutaneous, inhalation, and intraperitoneal. The particles enter the systemic circulation and are distributed to the various organs of the body and may remain structurally the same or be modified or metabolized. In cellular systems, they can cause biological toxicity by DNA damage or ROS generation. This leads to tissue damage, inflammation, cytotoxicity, and organ failure from the deposition of nanoparticles. And it also causes fibrosis and allergies (Fu et al., 2014, Malysheva et al., 2015). In environmental systems, nondegradable nanoparticles are ready to deposit in the groundwater, leading to production of environmental pollutants. Further, they may also be harmful to plants and microbes. The removal of nanoparticles from the environment is another challenging task in the management of nanotoxicity (Hussain et al., 2015, PourGashtasbi, 2015).",

It is argued that natural nanoparticles are not considerable as a new phenomenon because they come from daily human activities like mining, cooking, and combustion of materials (Gao et al., 2015). Nanoparticle studies have shown that they have some special properties, i.e., (1) ultrasmall-sized particles have extreme mobility and higher propagation in living organisms if not controlled, (2) they can create more toxic effects per unit compared to larger particles of the same chemicals, (3) they can be absorbed more quickly by cells, and (4) they move more quickly, contaminating the environment through air, soil, and water, leading to damage of plants and animals (Baalousha and Lead, 2013). Some kinds of nanoparticles are responsible for causing inflammatory reactions in the lungs, such as carbon black nanoparticles (QDs or polymeric nanoparticles). And, they cannot be considered as a uniform group of nanoparticles because they interact and behave in different manners depending upon several factors (Podila and Brown, 2013).",

Scientific research must answer many questions to allow the utilization of nanoparticles in human beings with an environmentally friendly approach. Such questions are as follows: (1) How do nanoparticle pathways affect the human body? (2) How long can nanoparticles remain in the human body? (3) What are the nanoparticles\u2019 effects on cellular and tissue functions? (Cochran et al., 2013). The main challenges of nanoparticle usage are the identification of toxicity-free nanoparticles, legal evaluation of the final medical products, and elimination of particles from biological and environmental systems. Nanomedicine remains challengeable because it does not fall into the traditional classifications of drugs or medical devices. Furthermore, the risk analyses of nanoparticles are complicated because of the lack of data, techniques, and issues (Ilinskaya and Dobrovolskaia, 2013b, Ilinskaya and Dobrovolskaia, 2013a).",

The US FDA has effective regulations for the use nanoparticles with strong technologies and scientific advances. Generally, the FDA classifies the regulatory processes for medical products as drugs, devices, and biological or combination products. But it lacks regulation for nanomedicine in aspects such as lack of scientific expertise and classification difficulties (Bowman and Gatof, 2015, Leite et al., 2015a). As for the environmental aspect, the excretory materials are mainly suspended in the air for long periods and cause respiratory disorders. The National Science Foundation and the Environmental Protection Agency are raising issues about the potential impact of nanomaterials on the environment and the adverse effects. A social issue is the usage of neurobiochips that stimulate the brain in humans and manipulate neuropsychological factors. Social and ethical issues are debated regarding implantable nanodevices that closely monitor illness, privacy rights, and risk of abuse. The prices of nanodevices would be very high, which is another social issue and one that affects the developing nations (Leite et al., 2015a). The ethical issues concern proving that nanoparticles are nontoxic, eco-friendly, unable to be used for terrorism purposes, and easy to remove when toxic effects are produced in the body (King, 2012, Resnik, 2012, Sechi et al., 2014).",

Ongoing research reports will give the answer and solve the biological and environmental toxicity. At this stage, nanostructured nanoparticles and nanomedicine will provide the high sensitivity, specificity, low cost, portability, and reusability of nanoparticles. It is a great invention in the field of pharmaceutical and medical sciences. Various technologies are being established to detect the very fine particles and scientific uncertainties surround the outcome of nanomedicine (Bello et al., 2013, Ji et al., 2013). The best case scenario brings the success of nanoparticle usage in the pharmaceutical and other fields. It will provide the fundamental basis to intensify the research in science and other disciplines. On one side, data are needed for scientific evidence and the toxicological profile of the nanoparticle. On the other side, the development of the nanoparticle process is not only a scientific task, but also requires answers to all the issues and questions. Jurists and legal scholars have reported that scientific discoveries following standard guidelines and providing the minimum safety standards are acceptable for protecting human health. In this point of view, nanotechnology offers an opportunity for major integration among the different disciplines and especially between science and law. Therefore, the nanostructured antimicrobial agent can be a future nanomedicine for neuroinfection-assisted neurodegenerative disorders.",
