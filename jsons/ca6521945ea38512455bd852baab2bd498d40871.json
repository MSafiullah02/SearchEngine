As dengue is not a respiratory infection, no respiratory infection control measures were in place for this patient. However, the hospitalized patient with dengue later received an additional diagnosis of COVID-19.",

COVID-19 can be easily missed in tropical countries, either because it occurs in conjunction with a common infectious disease (such as dengue), or because COVID-19 infection is misdiagnosed as another more common infection.",
