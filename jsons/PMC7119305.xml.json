Following the recommendations of the World Health Organization (WHO), many countries have made recommendations on non-pharmacological measures, especially during the beginning of the pandemic, such as improving hand and respiratory hygiene, the use of surgical facemasks, barrier nursing and quarantine of contacts, social distancing measures and travel restrictions (\nBell and World Health Organization Writing Group, 2006a, Ferguson et al., 2006, Nicoll, 2006). Some authors (\nBootsma and Ferguson, 2007, Hatchett et al., 2007, Longini et al., 2005) also report that these measures prolong the epidemic period and reduce the attack rate at the peak of the epidemic wave, thus reducing the burden of care and providing significant benefits during a period of increased demand for health services.",

Information on risk factors, medical conditions and vaccination were collected from medical records, but questions on the use of non-pharmacological measures were collected by personal interview and interviewers were not blinded to the status of cases and controls. However, the questionnaire was constructed with closed questions, the interviewers were trained and the questions related to a period of seven days before the onset of symptoms of patients hospitalized for influenza. Due to the rapid decline of the pandemic wave, most interviews were conducted retrospectively and the answers may have been affected by selective recall, although if this did not occur differentially, it should not have affected the results. Another possible limitation was that while only confirmed influenza infections were included in the case definition, some controls could have been misclassified due to lack of testing, false negative tests or the exclusion of other influenza virus strains. However, the exclusion criteria for controls were to have symptoms of either influenza-like illness or respiratory infection at hospital admission and hospital admission due to influenza later than April 2009. Therefore, there was probably no misclassification.",
