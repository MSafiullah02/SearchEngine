Study design Cohort study of late preterm infants admitted to a tertiary care NICU from January 2014-July 2015. Outcomes of late preterm infants of EOPE mothers were compared with the next late preterm infant of a LOPE mother and the next two late preterm infants of normotensive non-PE mothers. Primary outcome comprised use of continuous positive airway pressure, mechanical ventilation and/or surfactant in the 24 h after birth. Results Compared to normotensives (n = 131), adjusted odds ratio (AORs) of the primary outcome was higher in the EOPE (n = 64) and LOPE (n = 65) groups but reached statistical significance only in the EOPE group, AORs 12.9, 95% CI 3.5-37 and 2.7, 95% CI 0.95-8.1, respectively. Conclusions Compared to late preterm infants of normotensive and LOPE mothers, infants of mothers with EOPE have significantly higher respiratory morbidity.",

Although placental dysfunction is a hallmark of preeclampsia, the disorder is heterogeneous [10] . Based on gestational age at onset of disease, preeclampsia is classified as early, occurring before 34 weeks gestation and late occurring at or after 34 weeks of gestation [10, 11] . Both have similarities and distinct features. Placental changes are more marked in early onset preeclampsia while maternal factors such as increased body mass index (BMI) and metabolic syndrome play a greater role in late onset disease [12] . Early onset preeclampsia is also associated with a greater adverse impact on maternal and fetal health [13] . Although early onset disease manifests before 34 weeks gestation, a third of women deliver at or after 34 weeks gestation [12, 14] . Surprisingly, reports of the effects preeclampsia on outcomes of late preterm infants have not differentiated between early and late onset preeclampsia, despite significant differences between the two. The objective of our study was to investigate the effects of early and late onset preeclampsia on the outcomes of late preterm infants, with the primary objective being respiratory outcomes.",

The two most common diagnosis for respiratory distress in late preterm period, RDS and TTNB, can sometimes be difficult to distinguish based on clinical manifestations and chest X-ray [15] . Importantly, similar definition of respiratory morbidity has been used in other large studies [4, 5] . Secondary outcomes included (i) RDS-diagnosed based on signs of respiratory distress, a typical chest X-ray and/or need for surfactant [16] . (ii) TTNB-diagnosed on a chest X-ray showing good volume with increased vascularity and the presence of a transverse fissure [17] . (iii) Use of supplemental oxygen by nasal cannula.

Gestational age was based on a first trimester ultrasound and date of embryo transfer in cases of in vitro fertilization. Surfactant was administered when oxygen requirements were persistently >30%. Exclusion criteria included infants born with any congenital malformations or chromosomal anomalies, infants of mothers with chronic hypertension (onset before 20 weeks of gestation), maternal renal, cardiovascular, endocrine or autoimmune disease, substance abuse, and TORCH infections.

To identify risk factors for development of the primary outcome, multivariable ordered logistic regression with backward elimination approach was performed. Any risk factors that demonstrated associations, whether statistically significant or judged to be clinically significant, with both preeclampsia and the primary outcome but were not intermediate variables, were included in the modeling process as possible confounders [22] . The least significant variables were then removed until all remaining variables were significant at P value of 0.2. The P value of 0.2 was set conservatively as an entry for variables to proceed to the next step in the analysis [23] . The adjusted odds ratio (OR) and their 95% confidence interval (CI) are reported. A P < 0.05 was considered significant. Data were analyzed using STATA v. 13 (College Station, Texas, USA).",

Amongst the 67 women with early onset preeclampsia, four women with chronic hypertension and two with a history of substance abuse were excluded. There were three sets of twins in the group resulting in 64 infants eligible for the study. Of the 68 women with late onset preeclampsia, two women with substance abuse and one with chronic hypertension were excluded. There were no twins in the group resulting in 65 infants eligible for the study. One hundred and thirty three normotensive women who delivered late preterm infants between 34 and 36 weeks gestation were included as controls. On chart review, four of these women had a history of substance abuse, two had chronic hypertension and one each had systemic lupus erythematosus and antiphospholipid syndrome. They were excluded from the study. There were six sets of twins in the group resulting in 131 infants eligible for the study (Fig. 1) . Table 1 shows the maternal and neonatal demographic variables between the three groups. There was no difference in the maternal age, diabetes, twins, chorioamnionitis, smoking, number of male infants and Apgar scores <7 at 5 min between the three groups. Compared to the normotensive group, the number of primigravida mothers was Late onset preeclampsia vs. normotensive c Early onset preeclampsia vs. late onset preeclampsia higher in the two preeclamptic groups but the difference did not reach statistical significance. Compared with the other two groups, gestational age was significantly lower in the early onset preeclampsia group. Birthweight was significantly lower and SGA rates significantly higher in the two preeclampsia groups compared with the normotensive group (P < 0.00). Antenatal steroid use, C-section rates, and Apgar scores <7 at 1 min were significantly higher in the early onset preeclampsia group. Table 2A shows the univariate analysis of the primary outcome and its components in the three groups. All infants who received surfactant were also placed on mechanical ventilation. The composite outcome as well as the individual components were significantly higher in the early onset preeclampsia group (P = 0.02 for surfactant and <0.00 for the other variables). Table 2B shows the results of multivariable ordered logistic regression as the odds ratio (ORs) of the primary outcome in early and late onset preeclampsia with the normotensive group as the reference group. The final model included gestation, mode of delivery, sex, antenatal steroids, and small for gestational age. The odds of the primary outcome-CPAP use, mechanical ventilation and/or surfactant use-was greater in the two preeclampsia group with the early onset preeclampsia group having the higher odds. However, the higher odds in the late onset group did not reach statistical significance (OR 12.95% CI 3.8-37, P = < 0.00 for early onset preeclampsia and OR 2.7 95% CI 0.94-8.1, P = 0.06). Table 3 shows the secondary outcomes between the three groups. Compared to the normotensive group, TTNB, nasal cannula oxygen, hypoglycemia, SGA infants and use of phototherapy, duration of hospital stay was higher in the two preeclampsia groups. RDS was significantly higher in the early onset group.",

Gouyon et al., using a large cohort from France, reported higher risk of severe respiratory morbidity, in late preterm infants of mothers with hypertensive disorder of pregnancy [9] .

Respiratory morbidity, defined by the need for oxygen, CPAP or mechanical ventilation was higher at each gestational age in infants of hypertensive mothers but reached statistical significance only at 37 weeks. Lagenveld et al. compared outcomes of late preterm infants of mothers with preeclampsia, gestational hypertension and normotensive pregnancies in a large cohort from the Netherlands [25] . They found higher rates of hypoglycemia and SGA in the preeclampsia group, results similar to our study. The odds of RDS were lower in the preeclampsia group with no difference in TTNB and need for oxygen. However, the study did not have data on antenatal corticosteroid use, systolic blood pressure was not used in the definition of preeclampsia and 30% of the cohort was excluded because of missing data. Masoura et al. reported increased rates of hypoglycemia and RDS and lower Apgar scores in late preterm infants of preeclamptic mothers [26] . In a study from Australia, of infants 30-36 weeks gestation, ventilator support was required significantly more in infants of mothers with preeclampsia [27] . As in other studies, no distinction was made between early and late onset preeclampsia.",

            "text": "Our results demonstrate increased TTNB in late preterm infants of both early and late onset preeclampsia and increased RDS in early onset preeclampsia. In addition, the use of surfactant CPAP and mechanical ventilation was higher in late preterm infants of mothers with preeclampsia, with higher rates in infants of mothers with early onset preeclampsia. As primary CPAP is associated with better respiratory outcomes compared with elective intubation, nine of the fifteen infants placed on mechanical ventilation were initially tried on CPAP but had to be intubated because of worsening respiratory status and increasing oxygen requirements [28] . Of these nine patients, six were from the early onset, two from the late onset and one from the normotensive group. Increased respiratory morbidity in preterm infants of mothers with preeclampsia can potentially be explained by the antiangiogenic state in preeclampsia. Several studies have demonstrated higher levels of antiangiogenic factors, soluble vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-1 (sFlt-1) and soluble Endoglin and lower levels of angiogenic factors, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and placental growth factor in preeclampsia [10, [29] [30] [31] [32] . VEGF plays a key role in lung vascular development, which promotes alveolar growth, and also enhances surfactant protein production [33, 34] . In animal models, VEGF prevents RDS and higher levels of sFlt1 and lower levels of VEGF are described in more severe RDS [35] [36] [37] . Importantly, this antiangiogenic state is much more pronounced in early onset preeclampsia with levels of sFlt much higher and levels of VEGF much lower in early onset preeclampsia as compared with late onset preeclampsia [38, 39] . In addition, in early onset preeclampsia the fetus is exposed to the hostile intrauterine antiangiogenic environment for a longer period. These factors may be responsible for the worse respiratory outcomes in late preterm infants of mothers with early onset preelampsia as compared with infants of mothers with late onset preeclamsia and normotensive mothers. A negative correlation between sFlt1 levels and birthweight is reported in preeclampsia, with higher sFlt1 levels associated with lower birthweight [38, 40] . In our cohort, the lower birthweight in infants of preeclamptic mothers, more marked in the early onset group, can conceivably be attributed to this negative correlation. The composite outcome of CPAP and/or mechanical ventilation use in the normotensive group in our cohort was 8%, similar to the reports by Habli et al. and Gouyon where it was 9.5% and 8%, respectively [9, 24] . The rate of CPAP and/or mechanical ventilation use was higher in the preeclamptic group in our cohort compared to the study by Habli et al. (37 vs. 19 %) . However, their cohort included both preeclampsia and gestational hypertension which is a less severe disease associated with less respiratory morbidity, diluting the number of infants needing CPAP or mechanical ventilation.",

Importantly, our gestation was based on first trimester ultrasound or the date of embryo transfer in cases of IVF, largely limiting misclassification of gestation. In addition, health care in Canada is universal, negating the effect of socioeconomic status and differing antenatal and postnatal care on outcomes. However, there are limitations of our study. We did not investigate outcomes like intraventricular hemorrhage, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, or retinopathy of prematurity, which some studies have reported. These outcomes are, however, extremely uncommon in late preterm infants and an extremely large cohort would be needed to study them. Our population was also from single center making generalization of our results difficult. Although not the focus of the study, we did not measure any angiogenic or antiangiogenic factors in our population.",

There is uncertainty between planned immediate delivery or expectant management in women with preeclampsia between 34 and 36 weeks gestation [43] . Our data can be used to counsel mothers with preeclampsia in the late preterm period and help in identifying mothers who may benefit from delivery at facilities with higher levels of neonatal intensive care. Our results, however, need validation in a larger cohort.",
