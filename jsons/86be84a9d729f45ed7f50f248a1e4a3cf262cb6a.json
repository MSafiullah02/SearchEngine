Antiviral substances obtained from medicinal plants are potentially good targets to study. Glycyrrhiza uralensis and G. glabra have been commonly used in both traditional and modern medicine. In this study, extracts of G. uralensis roots and their components were examined for anti-HCV activity using an HCV cell culture system. It was found that a methanol extract of G. uralensis roots and its chloroform fraction possess anti-HCV activity with 50%-inhibitory concentrations (IC 50 ) of 20.0 and 8.0 mg/mL, respectively. Through bioactivity-guided purification and structural analysis, glycycoumarin, glycyrin, glycyrol and liquiritigenin were isolated and identified as anti-HCV compounds, their IC 50 being 8.8, 7.2, 4.6 and 16.4 mg/mL, respectively. However, glycyrrhizin, the major constituent of G. uralensis, and its monoammonium salt, showed only marginal anti-HCV activity. It was also found that licochalcone A and glabridin, known to be exclusive constituents of G. inflata and G. glabra, respectively, did have anti-HCV activity, their IC 50 being 2.5 and 6.2 mg/mL, respectively. Another chalcone, isoliquiritigenin, also showed anti-HCV activity, with an IC 50 of 3.7 mg/mL. Time-ofaddition analysis revealed that all Glycyrrhiza-derived anti-HCV compounds tested in this study act at the post-entry step. In conclusion, the present results suggest that glycycoumarin, glycyrin, glycyrol and liquiritigenin isolated from G. uralensis, as well as isoliquiritigenin, licochalcone A and glabridin, would be good candidates for seed compounds to develop antivirals against HCV.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "with the viral genome; however, the nonstructural proteins constitute the viral replication complex, where replication of the viral genome takes place.

We also confirmed that production of HCV infectious particles is inhibited by glycycoumarin, glycyrin and glycyrol at 1 and 2 days post-infection (Fig 1c) .", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [{"start": 458, "end": 470, "text": "(Fig. 1a, b)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}, {"start": 619, "end": 627, "text": "(Fig 1c)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Mode-of-action of G. uralensis-derived isolated compounds and related compounds obtained from other Glycyrrhiza species"}, {"text": "Glycyrrhiza species possess a variety of bioactive compounds, such as: (i) triterpenoids, for example, glycyrrhizin, glycyrrhetic acid 3-O-glucuronide, glycyrrhetinic acid and various licorice-saponins; (ii) coumarins, for example, glycycoumarin, glycyrin and glycyrol; (iii) flavanones, for example, liquiritin and liquiritigenin; (iv) chalcones, for example, isoliquiritigenin and licochalcone; (v) isoflavans, for example, glabridin; (vi) stilbenoids, for example, dihydrostilbenes; and other miscellaneous compounds (11) . In this connection, flavanones, chalcones and isoflavans are members of flavonoids. Glycyrrhizin is the major constituent of Glycyrrhiza species, representing 1-9% of the total (14) . Glycyrrhizin and other compounds isolated from Glycyrrhiza species reportedly possess antiviral activity against a variety of viruses (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) . With regard to HCV, it was recently reported that glycyrrhizin inhibits HCV infection in Huh-7 cells (19, 20) . On the other hand, controversial observations have been reported in clinical settings; namely, that glycyrrhizin has no significant effect on amounts of HCV RNA whereas it reduces serum alanine aminotransferase concentrations in HCV-infected patients (16, 17) . These apparently contradictory findings might be explained by a membrane-stabilizing effect of glycyrrhizin; clear evidence for antiviral activity of glycyrrhizin is still lacking (10) . In the present study, we observed that glycyrrhizin and glycyrrhizic acid monoammonium showed only marginal anti-HCV activity (Table 3) . Glycyrrhetinic acid showed significant anti-HCV activity. However, their anti-HCV activities were significantly weaker than that of the HPLC fractions obtained from G. uralensis extract. On the other hand, we found that certain coumarins, such as glycycoumarin, glycyrin and glycyrol, and a flavanone, liquiritigenin, isolated from G. uralensis, as well as other compounds contained in Glycyrrhiza species, possess potent anti-HCV activities. Mode-of-action analysis revealed that all the Glycyrrhiza-derived anti-HCV compounds tested act primarily at the post-entry step. Consistent with our observations, other researchers have also reported that two flavonoids, isoliquiritigenin and glycycoumarin, extracted from Glycyrrhizae radix, either G. uralensis or G. glabra, inhibit replication of an HCV subgenomic RNA replicon in vitro (35) . The IC 50 values of isoliquiritigenin and glycycoumarin against HCV subgenomic replicon were 6.2 and 15.5 mg/mL, respectively. On the other hand, to the best of our knowledge, there are no published reports so far regarding anti-HCV activities of glycyrin and glycyrol. It has been reported that glycyrin, which is known to possess peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-g ligand-binding activity, shows antibacterial activity against Streptococcus pyogenes, Haemophilus influenzae and Moraxella catarrhalis (36) (37) (38) . Glycyrol reportedly exerts anti-inflammatory effects by binding to calcineurin to inhibit its activity (39, 40) . However, the possible antimicrobial activity of glycyrol has not been reported. Further study is needed to elucidate the detailed mechanism of anti-HCV activities of glycyrin and glycyrol, and also possible antiviral activities against viruses other than HCV.", "cite_spans":
