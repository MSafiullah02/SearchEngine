These problems pose immense challenges that can voraciously consume human and capital resources. Tracking the initiation, spread, and changing trends of Covid-19 at population-wide scales is one of the most daunting challenges, especially the urgent need to map the distribution and magnitude of Covid-19 in near real-time. Other than pre-exposure prophylaxis or therapeutic treatments, the most important tool is the ability to quickly identify infected individuals. The mainstay approach for epidemics has long involved the large-scale application of diagnostic testing at the individual case level. But this approach faces overwhelming challenges in providing fast surveys of large populations.",

WBE measures chemical signatures in sewage, such as fragment biomarkers from the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), simply by applying the type of clinical diagnostic testing (designed for individuals) to the collective signature of entire communities. As such, it could rapidly establish the presence of Covid-19 infections across an entire community. Surprisingly, this tool has not been widely embraced by epidemiologists or public health officials. Presented is an overview of why and how governments should exercise prudence and begin evaluating WBE and coordinating development of a standardized WBE methodology -one that could be deployed within nationalized monitoring networks to provide intercomparable data across nations.

In a matter of months after SARS-CoV-2 infections spread worldwide, most governments struggled with trying to quickly determine the most fundamental aspect of the pandemic -the distribution and magnitude of infected populations.

This greatly increased the difficulty in efficiently directing the public health resources essential for the containment, control, or mitigation of transmission.

Without the ability to rapidly and inexpensively monitor randomly selected individuals for infectious virus (e.g., via molecular nucleic acid tests) or evidence of prior exposure (via antibody tests), the ability to quickly isolate or quarantine contagious individuals simply did not exist. The only option was simplistic and involved indiscriminate isolation (city-wide stay-at-home, shutdown, or lock-down policies) and physical distancing practices for entire populations -to discourage the congregation of people beyond those they live with. This in turn handcuffed governments from making informed decisions critical for knowing how or when large portions of the population could return to their workplaces (the quandary of balancing lives and livelihoods). Re-engaging businesses with the economy would rely too much on guesswork and luck -and far too much effort to rationally coordinate beyond geographic and political boundaries. Such was the reality that emerged in many countries during the first months of 2020 because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Much still remains to unfold with the domino, knock-on effects of this pandemic. And even if the world can figure out how to efficiently deal with Covid-19, more pandemics are inevitably looming -some inevitably amplified yet further by coinciding natural disasters (e.g., see Smith 2020) .",

The existing tools were designed specifically for diagnostic (or serological) testing of individuals. Scaling these conventional tests for mass surveillance of populations is fraught with tremendous challenges, including the extremely high costs for repeatedly testing large portions of population (Allen et al. 2020), involving enormous human resources, insufficient sensitivity, and inadequate throughput; note, however, there are ways to greatly improve sensitivity -especially when the incidence of negatives will be high (e.g., in infected asymptomatic populations) (Suo et al. 2020 ) -and to increase the throughput of conventional methods (NAS 2020), such as via pooled sampling progress globally far exceed these and are rapidly growing. Three current review articles discuss many of the complex issues surrounding the application of WBE to infectious disease tracking - Covid-19 in particular (Kitajima et al. 2020; Sims and Kasprzyk-Hordern 2020; and Xagoraraki and O'Brien 2020) .

Most importantly, this approach to testing needs to continually increase test coverage (i.e., the percentage of the population tested) until a key level is achieved. This level is the number of tests that must be completed in order to reveal a single positive (confirmed) case. This ratio is the most direct indicator of the extent of infection in the general population (Hasell 2020) . A low ratio (when using random sampling) points to a high incidence of infection and therefore the need for more intensive testing until the ratio significantly increases (where ever-increasing amounts of testing are required to confirm each additional case of infection). This indicates increasing success in containment or mitigation measures. The first can be partly accomplished with the use of more advanced versions of current diagnostic tests (NAS 2020), such as pooled-sample analysis (e.g., Deckert et al. 2020 ). Pooledsample analysis could greatly increase testing capacity and throughput, especially for PCR-based methods (nucleic acid\u2212based polymerase chain reaction); although not as sensitive as PCR testing, antigen testing (e.g., capsid proteins) is just emerging for SARS-CoV-2, with the US FDA's emergency use authorization for the first antigen test (US FDA 2020). The second can be accomplished by pre-targeting sub-populations that have a higher probability of infection. This would conserve the use of available diagnostic tests.",

As such, WBE's role in fighting the spread of Covid-19 would be analogous to warfare where \"forward observers\" are used to improve the outcomes of artillery fire by greatly improving the accuracy of targeting. WBE would, in effect, provide a call warning for fire (i.e., \"start diagnostic testing here\"), directing fire, adjusting fire, and confirming mission accomplished. This would greatly reduce the demand for diagnostic testing and also reduce supply-chain shortages caused by insufficient manufacturing capacity.

There is no reason that WBE must be based on the same analytical platforms used in clinical diagnostic testing (i.e., direct measures of viral infection such as PCR or antigen testing). WBE for Covid-19 (or diseases caused by any other infectious agent) need not be limited to the monitoring of the actual infectious agent's nucleic acid or an antigen. WBE's usefulness could be greatly expanded by targeting endogenous biomarkers that are significantly elevated in the diseased state. Benefits of targeting indirect markers of infection might include reduced analytical costs and broader availability (e.g., by use of immunoassays) or serving as better leading indicators of infection (providing the possibility of earlier alerts); biomarkers that are excreted extensively in urine (as opposed to feces), for example, would simplify sewage sampling and sample preparation prior to analysis. A likely place to start evaluating the use of biomarkers would be to make use of the fact that Covid RNA fragments may not be originating from viable virus, but rather from virus remnants (litter) from cleared infections and therefore could be overestimating the incidence or intensity of existing infections. This could well be a cause of repeated reports of recovered patients again testing positive for Covid-19 (e.g., Cha and Smith 2020).",

Should SARS-CoV-2 eventually become endemic (Galanti and Shaman 2020), it could be critical to have an ongoing community-wide surveillance system to detect newly emerging clusters.

The power of drawing conclusions from WBE monitoring will be a direct function of the range in these variabilities for individuals and the general population. The greater the variability, the harder it will be to determine if infections are from a few super-shedders or from a large portion of the population (e.g., see: Chen, Gao et al. 2020; Petterson 2020;Wu, Xiao et al. 2020). It is possible that an antigen unique to SARS-CoV-2 might partition to excreta with more fidelity and better reproducibility.Furthermore, because of the duration of RNA excretion via the stool, it may not reflect active infections. This means that the collective signal of sewage RNA at any point in time might reflect unknown portions of active and past infections. is the targeted marker, there are currently too many unknowns surrounding the kinetics of viral load and excretion over the entire course of an infection (Joynt and Wu 2020",

The limited studies to date indicate that the fecal route is more important for SAR-CoV-2, at least for nucleic acids; but it is unknown for possible antigen targets. Likewise, the partitioning of a marker between feces and the liquid sewage needs to be established. especially given that raw sewage is heterogenous. The aqueous phase is a far more easily sampled medium and requires far less preparation for analysis.et al. 2018). This could provide an existing platform within which WBE sensors could eventually be integrated to fully automate monitoring and its remote reporting.This can be an extremely onerous problem(Daughton 2012b(Daughton  , 2018. Important to keep in mind is that an endogenous, excreted proxy marker for per capita population would remove the need to know the population size of a sewershed and could prove moreAddressing each of these points would be required for calibrating any WBE monitoring method so that data could be related to actual per capita infection rates. A number of different means have been proposed, the inverse regression of qPCR cycle thresholds with known infection rates being one example(Bar Or et al. 2020).

To facilitate the development of globally harmonized methodologies, proprietary monitoring systems should be discouraged. An open-source model is essential to encourage wide adoption and minimize cost. A Manhattan-style project might indeed be an apt metaphor for what is needed to fight Covid-19.Any type of such a big-science project (e.g., Cahill et al. 2020; Copeland 2020) needs to consider incorporating WBE in its full spectrum of potential strategies.Another focus would be in determining how to best communicate WBE monitoring data to the public while minimizing panic or anxiety. This points to the need for science writers and other experts to publically communicate WBE advancements and how WBE data should be interpreted. Finally, it would be important to locate those having intense interest in the potential J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f of WBE and who could serve as its shepherds or champions to attract interest or involvement of politicians, military leaders, and other government officials concerned with public health, financial stability, and national security. Noteworthy is that over the last 15 years, WBE has been championed primarily by European countries and Australia for the purpose of monitoring illicit drug use; see discussion and references cited inSims and Kasprzyk-Hordern (2020).Only a few national coalitions or efforts have been launched for Covid-19, three examples being Australia (WaterRA 2020), Canada (CWN 2020), and Spain (Idrica 2020); the European Commission's Joint Research Centre and the Directorate-General for Environment is assessing the feasibility of an EU-wide WBE program (European Commission 2020). In the U.S., however, WBE has received little national reception. While some municipalities and sewage treatment plants in the U.S. have shown interest in piloting WBE for local Covid-19tracking (e.g., see: City of Tempe 2020), state and federal governments in the U.S. have expressed surprisingly little interest. Only as of this writing has any indication begun to emerge that U.S. federal agencies (i.e., the CDC and EPA) might be interested in WBE for Covid-19(Swan et al. 2020).Important to note is that the published science literature (as well as science news; see: Arnaud 2020; Baggaley 2020; Mallapaty 2020) on WBE for monitoring infectious disease has begun an extremely rapid phase of growth -one that will undoubtedly escalate. It could prove increasingly time-consuming to track and assimilate this new base of emerging knowledge -as well as the plans for new research or demonstration projects. A centralized database of all known publications and preprints on WBE, as well as gray literature such as reports, dissertations, web pages, and news stories would prove extremely useful; note that the World Health Organization maintains a database of publications on all aspects of Covid-19 and that it currently comprises over 15,000 articles (WHO 2020b). This is an astonishing number of published articles over a period of roughly only 4 months and marked by numerous major events surrounding J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f (Anonymous 2020); the primary focus of these articles is on the epidemiology, diagnostics, and clinical medicine of Covid-19 -not on WBE.",
