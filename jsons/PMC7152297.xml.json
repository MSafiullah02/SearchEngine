Although the incidence of HAV infection has fallen dramatically since the introduction of vaccines, it still causes approximately 60,000 infections per year and occasionally causes dramatic outbreaks with fulminant hepatitis and death.1 Fecal-oral transmission is facilitated by extensive viral shedding in feces during the 3- to 6-week incubation period, which reaches a maximum just before the onset of hepatocellular injury.1 An increasing incidence has been noted among urban homosexual men. An effective vaccine has been developed.",

The immune tolerance phase is seen largely in patients who acquire infection at birth or in early childhood. These patients have high levels of HBV replication but little to no liver inflammation and normal serum aminotransferase levels. Serum HBeAg is detectable, and HBV DNA is markedly elevated.10, 11, 15, 16 As the host immune system matures, the patient enters the immune clearance phase, which is characterized by immune-mediated liver injury. Patients who acquire infection as children come to clinical attention in this stage, and those who acquire infection as adolescents or adults have a very short or no immune tolerance phase and rapidly move into this second phase of the infection. Viral levels decrease, but HBV DNA is still elevated, and HBeAg is detectable. Serum aminotransferases increase, and liver histology shows active chronic hepatitis with evolving fibrosis.10 Although most patients remain asymptomatic, some present with flares that mimic acute hepatitis, and this may precede the development of antibodies to HBeAg and remission of hepatitis activity.10 Spontaneous seroconversion to anti-HBeAg antibody (HBeAb)-positive status occurs in up to 90% of white adults with chronic hepatitis B within 10 years of follow-up, and it is more likely in those with high transaminase levels, which indicate a vigorous immune response to HBV.10, 16\n",

Approximately 0.5% of persons with inactive chronic hepatitis clear HBsAg yearly, and most of these will develop antibodies to HBsAg.15 However, covalently closed circular DNA remains in the nucleus of hepatocytes, even in patients with serologic evidence of resolved infection, and poses a livelong risk for reactivation of infection.15\n",

The AASLD recommends against treating adults with immune-tolerant hepatitis B, but ALT levels should be tested periodically to monitor for the transition to immune-active stage.15 Moderate to severe necroinflammatory activity or fibrosis on liver biopsy warrants consideration to initiate antiviral therapy.15\n",

Portal tracts are mildly to moderately inflamed and show periportal fibrosis, with immature fibrous tissue extending as thin perisinusoidal strands into the acinus. At the interface, a proliferation of ductal-type cells lends a hypercellularity to the portal areas. Immunohistochemical stains show extensive cytoplasmic and membranous expression with HBsAg and extensive nuclear and cytoplasmic HBcAg.26, 28, 29 The combination of high HBV antigen expression, marked hepatocyte injury, and relatively little inflammation suggests that the virus itself may be cytopathic in this setting.26, 27, 29 Fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis is associated with a high rate of viral replication, with high serum HBV DNA, high serum HBsAg titers, and rapid deterioration.27, 28, 29 It has also been described in HBV infection in other settings involving immunosuppression, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection30 and bone marrow transplantation.31\n",

However, the reduced immune reaction is potentially responsible for the relatively reduced inflammation in these patients despite their higher HBV viral replication rates.33 Even though there is reduced inflammation, HBV infection is more progressive in HIV-positive patients, including development of cirrhosis and its complications.33 A pattern of hepatitis similar to fibrosing cholestatic hepatitis has been described in HIV patients with concurrent HBV infection.30 The HBV-related mortality in HIV patients has increased since the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), possibly because of increased immunologic injury to the liver with immune reconstitution, toxicity of the antiviral drugs, or longer life spans in HIV patients.33 Conversely, the use of antiretroviral agents that also have activity against HBV may slow the progression of chronic HBV and even result in seroconversion, whereas their discontinuation can cause significant liver disease due to reemergence of HBV replication.32\n",

In advanced cirrhosis, the extensive deposition of elastin and increased cross-linking of the extracellular matrix may prove more resistant to degradation.61 Another theory that has been proposed as a possible explanation for this phenomenon is the concept of \u201coccult HCV\u201d in which very sensitive assays are able to detect the presence of virus in plasma, lymphocytes, and macrophages in patients with a confirmed sustained viral response (SVR).61 Finally, genetic variants may be responsible because the rate of fibrosis regression differs among different ethnic groups.61 Patients who did not enjoy a good response to therapy tend to progress similarly to those who were not treated.60\n",

In 2014 IFN-free combinations became available that proved to have extremely high efficacy in achieving SVR in patients with chronic HCV, including patients considered difficult to treat, such as cirrhotics and those with genotype 1. Still, genotype may continue to be useful information in the decision of which combination to use because some, not all, DAAs have consistent activity across all genotypes and some genotypes are more likely to harbor resistance mutations. Despite the excitement IFN-free treatment of HCV has produced, the high cost of these drugs and other barriers to access remain as challenges to the eradication of HCV.",

The severity of hepatitis in coinfection depends on the virulence of the concomitant HBV infection and ranges from mild hepatitis to severe acute hepatitis with high mortality.73 The usual outcome is complete recovery, and only 2% of patients develop chronic disease; resolution produces immunity to both viruses. Superinfection presents as exacerbation in a patient with preexisting chronic hepatitis or as a new hepatitis in a previously asymptomatic HBV carrier. In superinfection, chronic infection develops in more than 90% of cases.73 HDV infection inhibits HBV replication, resulting in little to no evidence of HBV replication, with antibodies to HBeAg and low HBV DNA.73 Treatment with IFN-\u03b1 inhibits HDV replication, but relapse is common.",

For example, in a nationwide survey of blood donors in France, 22.4% of the population had IgG to HEV and 1% of the population had IgM to HEV.86 Areas of highest prevalence of IgG corresponded to areas of higher consumption of pork meat, raw pork liver sausage, game meat, offal, and oysters. In the United States the seroprevalence rate between 1988 and 1994 was 21%, with the likelihood of exposure increasing with age.87 The presence of anti-HEV IgM is required to make the diagnosis of acute infection, but specific testing may not be available in all geographic locations. A rising IgG anti-HEV titer can provide evidence of infection, and PCR for HEV RNA provides additional supportive evidence.",

Fatal cases may show widespread hepatocyte necrosis, lobular disarray with pseudorosettes, giant cell transformation of hepatocytes, and ductular metaplasia of hepatocytes.106 Cytomegalic inclusion bodies have been described in hepatocytes, endothelial cells, and bile duct epithelium.106 However, inclusions may be absent by routine histologic assessment, and immunohistochemistry or in situ hybridization may be useful, although their utility in this population has not been formally studied.105 CMV has also been implicated in extrahepatic biliary atresia, based on studies demonstrating CMV DNA in liver tissue, serologic evidence of CMV infection, or positive urine cultures in a subset of infants with biliary atresia.107, 108, 109 Inclusions have not been described by histologic assessment.108 Although intriguing, the possible association between biliary atresia and CMV may lead to delay in diagnosis of biliary atresia when a child presenting with cholestasis is found to have clinical evidence of CMV infection.107, 108 Clinical evidence of CMV infection should not preclude evaluation for other causes of cholestasis, particularly biliary atresia, which requires early surgical intervention.",

Rare cases of massive hepatic necrosis have been reported, usually in immunocompromised hosts. In immunocompetent hosts, CMV infection can result in a histologic picture virtually identical to that of EBV hepatitis, with sinusoidal beading, atypical lymphocytes within sinusoids, lymphocytic infiltrates in portal tracts, and areas of necrosis with aggregates of Kupffer cells resulting in a granulomatous appearance.110, 111 CMV infection is rarely associated with well-formed nonnecrotizing granulomas112 or fibrin ring granulomas.113 In immunocompromised patients, viral inclusions may be found in hepatocytes, endothelial cells, Kupffer cells, and duct epithelium (Fig. 11.9\n). Virally infected cells show a large amphophilic nuclear inclusion surrounded by a halo, known as an \u201cowl's-eye\u201d nuclear inclusion, and coarsely granular cytoplasmic inclusions. The inclusions may be isolated, or they may elicit an inflammatory reaction that can be granulomatous or neutrophilic, the latter being especially common in transplantation patients.110 In fact, a pattern of \u201cdisseminated focal hepatitis\u201d with small inflammatory foci in the lobules composed of either neutrophils or mononuclear cells should prompt exclusion of CMV in transplant patients by searching for inclusions or immunohistochemistry.114 In HIV-positive patients, bile duct involvement may result in sclerosing cholangitis (HIV-associated cholangiopathy). Immunohistochemical stains for CMV can highlight cells with inclusions, including atypical inclusions, and may stain infected hepatocytes that are not recognizable as infected cells on routine stains, increasing sensitivity for the diagnosis of CMV hepatitis.",

Several reports raise the possibility that parvovirus B19 may cause acute hepatitis, fulminant hepatitis, or fulminant hepatic failure. These cases describe several lines of evidence that implicate parvovirus B19, including the presence of parvovirus B19 DNA in the liver of patients with fulminant hepatic failure, the presence of parvovirus B19 DNA in liver tissue or serum of patients with acute or fulminant hepatitis, and the presence of IgM to parvovirus B19 in serum in patients with acute hepatitis.121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126 In patients with fulminant hepatic failure,123 parvovirus B19 DNA was found in liver tissue in four of six patients with associated aplastic anemia and in two of four patients without aplastic anemia but not in six patients with known causes of acute liver failure. Histology studies in these and other125 cases showed a range of injury, from mild lobular hepatitis to massive or submassive hepatic necrosis and collapse with either no inflammatory infiltrates or small aggregates of lymphocytes. Viral inclusions are not seen on routinely stained slides, but parvovirus VP1 antigen (a structural protein produced by the virus) was detected by immunohistochemistry in one case report.125 In contrast, other investigators found no parvovirus B19 DNA by PCR in 33 cases of cryptogenic acute liver failure but detected parvovirus B19 DNA in several patients with known causes of acute liver failure.127 In that study, several patients had low-titer IgM positivity without confirmatory PCR positivity. In another study, parvovirus B19 DNA was found with similar frequency in patients with fulminant hepatitis and with hepatitis B or C.128 Furthermore, RNA transcripts could not be detected in any of the liver tissue samples, arguing against active viral replication.120 These studies suggest that low levels of PCR positivity may reflect remote infection, and they raise questions about the role of parvovirus B19 in acute hepatitis and acute liver failure.",

Histologic evidence of caseating granulomas has a median sensitivity of 68% (range: 14% to 100%) and is generally sufficient to establish the diagnosis in TB-endemic areas.171 PCR for M. tuberculosis DNA has a 53% to 88% sensitivity and a 96% to 100% specificity for detecting hepatic TB.170, 184, 185 Immunocompromised patients may present with a wasting syndrome in which multiple organs, including the liver, contain necrotic miliary nodules surrounded by histiocytes that do not aggregate into well-formed granulomas. AFB stain shows numerous organisms in these lesions.186 Prompt initiation of four-drug anti-TB therapy should lead to clinical improvement in most patients with hepatic TB.",

Hepatic granulomas have been described in patients after intradermal injections of BCG.201, 202 Pneumonitis or granulomatous hepatitis, or both, affect 0.7% of patients who receive multiple intravesical instillations of BCG and are more likely after traumatic catheterization, extensive tumor resection, or bladder perforation.203 Rarely, acute hepatic failure with encephalopathy may develop.204 The liver shows noncaseating epithelioid granulomas, epithelioid giant cells, mild steatosis, hepatocyte necrosis, and portal inflammation.205, 206, 207 Often, AFB are not identified, and cultures are negative. This has led to the suggestion that the granulomatous hepatitis represents a hypersensitivity reaction to antigens present in the BCG preparation,201 particularly because some cases show additional features of extrahepatic granulomas, leukocytoclastic vasculitis, or bile duct injury and eosinophils (Fig. 11.18\n).208, 209 However, in some reported cases, AFB have been identified in the granulomas, blood cultures have been positive for M. bovis, or PCR for mycobacterial DNA has been positive, indicating disseminated BCG infection.209, 210, 211, 212 Some have suggested that two types of adverse reactions may occur, one a disseminated infection that responds to anti-TB therapy and the other a sterile hypersensitivity reaction that is delayed in appearance and responds to steroids.209\n",

            "text": "Culture of aspirated purulent material from the abscess or of blood may yield the offending organisms, although both of these are occasionally negative. Sometimes blood culture results do not correlate with pus culture results; therefore blood culture alone is not sufficient to determine the etiology.217 Depending on the organism, serology may be useful. The most commonly isolated organisms are Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus, Streptococcus, and Pseudomonas spp.217, 219, 221 A third of infections are polymicrobial (Fig. 11.19\n). Organisms that produce formic hydrogenlyase, such as Klebsiella spp. and E. coli, can convert acids that accumulate within the abscess to carbon dioxide and hydrogen gas; infection with these organisms can result in gas-forming pyogenic abscess, which carries a higher risk of septic shock, bacteremia, and mortality.223 The incidence of K. pneumoniae abscesses has increased in recent years, and this organism is now the leading cause of pyogenic liver abscesses in Asia. K. pneumoniae abscess may be suspected on the basis of the following features on abdominal CT: a thin abscess wall, presence of necrotic debris within the abscess cavity, presence of metastatic infection, and absence of underlying biliary disease.224 Abscesses secondary to Yersinia enterocolitica or Yersinia pseudotuberculosis are often associated with underlying hemochromatosis.225, 226, 227, 228 Anaerobes are isolated in up to 25% of cases, sometimes together with aerobes.218, 229, 230 Microaerophilic streptococci, Bacteroides fragilis, Fusobacterium necrophorum, and Clostridium spp. are the most commonly implicated anaerobes. Actinomyces spp. are infrequently found by either anaerobic culture of aspirated pus or identification of filamentous bacteria and sulfur granules on histologic examination of resection material (Fig. 11.20\n); these organisms may be associated with the formation of sinus tracts.231, 232, 233, 234 Rarely, Francisella tularensis,235\nBurkholderia pseudomallei (the agent of melioidosis),236, 237 or Listeria monocytogenes\n238 causes liver abscesses.

Possible sources include reflux of intestinal contents through the choledochal sphincter; passage from an infected gallbladder; and lymphatic, hepatic arterial, or portal venous bacteremia.242 Obstruction is most often due to gallstones. Other causes include strictures, malignancy, and congenital anomalies of the ampulla of Vater. How bactibilia and obstruction leads to biliary septicemia is uncertain. Cholangiovenous reflux with increased intrabiliary pressure can be demonstrated using contrast, and higher biliary pressures are associated with an increased incidence of purulent bile, sepsis, and bacteremia.242\n",

The disease is characterized by abdominal pain, fever, chills, and jaundice, resulting from recurrent attacks of suppurative cholangitis associated with intrahepatic biliary stones.251 The cause is not fully known, but bacterial infection of the biliary tree is perhaps the inciting event. Enteric organisms, particularly E. coli, are cultured from bile in most cases.251 Bacteria deconjugate bilirubin glucuronide, which then precipitates with calcium in the bile as soft, brown, friable calcium bilirubinate stones.251, 252 Exactly what predisposes patients to biliary tract infection is unknown, but the geographic distribution of this disease mirrors that of Clonorchis sinensis and Ascaris lumbricoides, and biliary parasites are detected in a significant minority of patients.251 Dead flukes and ova within the bile ducts, accompanied by bile stasis, may lead to bacterial infection. However, large numbers of people in endemic areas are infested with liver flukes without recurrent pyogenic cholangitis. In any case, the recurrent cholangitis results in intense periductal inflammation and fibrosis, strictures, and dilated ducts filled with sludge, predominantly affecting the left lobe.252\n",

It largely affects handlers of livestock, particularly those in the meatpacking industry, due to direct contact with animals and animal parts. It may also be acquired by ingestion of unpasteurized dairy products or infected meat, or by occupational exposure in veterinarians and clinical laboratory workers. The organism escapes destruction by replicating intracellularly within phagocytic cells, and thus involvement of the liver is common given its large population of reticuloendothelial cells. Although mildly elevated transaminases or hepatomegaly are seen in almost all patients, a true hepatitis (defined as a five-fold or greater increase in transaminases) is seen in approximately 25% of cases.255 A cholestatic presentation may also be seen. Brucella melitensis accounts for most cases of hepatic involvement, whereas Brucella abortus and Brucella suis are seen in a minority of cases. Most (approximately 90%) patients present with an acute illness (0 to 2 months in duration) characterized by malaise, fever, chills, sweats, arthralgia, weight loss, and headache, but some patients become symptomatic after many years of dormancy or are episodically symptomatic.255, 256, 257 Fever in brucellosis patients can be intermittent and has been described as \u201cundulant fever.\u201d Subacute and chronic presentations are less common but do occur.",

Of these cases, only four (20%) also showed granulomas.262 The remainder of the cases showed mixed inflammation (one case, 5%) or no significant inflammation (four cases, 20%). Thus granulomas may correlate with more severe liver disease because in other studies liver biopsies were usually done because of biochemical evidence of liver dysfunction. Granulomas in brucellosis may be indistinguishable from TB or sarcoidosis, and brucellosis should be considered in any patient with hepatic granulomas.260 Some authors consider granulomas in brucellosis to be smaller and less clearly defined than in TB, sarcoidosis, or histoplasmosis258; the term \u201cmicrogranuloma\u201d has also been used to describe them.262 The presence of granulomas does not reliably distinguish among the various species of Brucella,263, 264, 265, 266 despite a report that B. melitensis is not associated with granulomas.267 Other findings may include nonspecific acute hepatitis with hepatocyte necrosis, portal inflammation, and Kupffer cell hyperplasia.256, 257, 258, 261, 266 Liver involvement by brucellosis generally follows a benign course, and a full recovery in greater than 95% patients is expected after treatment with doxycycline in combination with an aminoglycoside and/or rifampin.256 Relapse of chronic brucellosis may be precipitated by viral illness or trauma.257\n",

The most common is a solitary liver abscess, often large and located in the right lobe, with a central calcification, which occurs only in adults and should immediately prompt suspicion of brucellosis in an endemic setting. A less common presentation is multiple small abscesses in the liver and spleen, known as \u201cmiliary\u201d pattern, which occurs in children and adults and mimics disseminated TB.268 Histologically, a brucelloma shows necrotic areas surrounded by a palisaded granulomatous reaction.269, 270 Some cases may show only fibrosis with dense chronic inflammation.272 Organisms are isolated from cultures of abscess material in only 18% of cases. When an organism is identified in patients with liver abscesses (combining cultures of blood and abscess material), the majority (80%) are due to B. melitensis, and the remainder are due to B. abortus (12%) and B. suis (8%).268 In addition to antibiotics, management of brucellomas requires surgery in approximately half of cases, and resolution of the lesions is expected in the overwhelming majority of cases.",

Neutrophils are recruited to the area, forming abscesses, and after a few days, granulomas form in an attempt to impede further spread.

Retraction of these scars can distort the liver by producing pseudolobules or so-called hepar lobatum.324 Scars near the hilum may result in portal hypertension. Less commonly, secondary syphilis may also present as mass-forming lesions in the liver, leading to a radiologic diagnosis of malignancy.303, 321, 322, 325 Lesions are typically multiple in number, ranging from two to innumerable, and may be up to 5.7 cm in size. Histologically the lesions consist of a variably cellular storiform spindle cell proliferation with mixed inflammation, sometimes with abscesses.303, 323, 325 The lesions contain numerous spirochetes, particularly within the walls of small blood vessels.303, 321, 322 The background liver may show mixed inflammation with portal edema, pericholangitis/cholangitis with duct injury, and granulomas. Although pathologically the lesions mimic a spindle cell neoplasm, awareness of the clinical scenario, as well as the background inflamed liver, should enable the pathologist to suspect syphilis. Treatment with intramuscular benzathine penicillin or, less commonly, oral ceftriaxone or doxycycline, should result in resolution of mass lesions and LFT abnormalities.",

Some cases contain abundant eosinophilic infiltration and may be described as eosinophilic granulomas; this is common in zygomycosis due to Basidiobolus ranarum.390, 394, 395, 396 These fungi have broad (10 to 20 \u00b5m), aseptate or hyposeptate, ribbonlike hyphae with right-angle branching, and they have a propensity to invade blood vessels, leading to extensive necrosis, infarctions, and dissemination.382, 383, 384, 385, 393, 397 When eosinophilic inflammation is prominent, degenerated fungal organisms may be associated with dense, hyalinized, eosinophilic material (Splendore-Hoeppli phenomenon). Diagnosis requires identification of the fungus in tissue or culture. However, tissue culture sensitivity is poor, possibly because the grinding of tissue in preparation for plating destroys the delicate hyphae, and this technique is no longer recommended.382 PCR-based techniques for diagnosis are also available. Blood cultures are always negative. In tissue identification, erroneous classification as Aspergillus may occur if the hyphae are hyposeptate.382 Some evidence suggests that iron is required for growth of zygomycetes, and thus there is interest in using iron chelators in combination with antifungal agents to treat zygomycosis; however, it is not established whether this approach is more effective.",

S. intestinalis may also cause radiologically detected hypodense parenchymal lesions, which on biopsy show necrotizing cholangitis consisting of periportal mixed inflammation coalescing into granulomatous microabscesses with foamy macrophages that contain organisms.421\nS. intestinalis, unlike E. bieneusi, may infect macrophages, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells, in addition to epithelial cells; thus the presence of foamy macrophages suggests S. intestinalis infection.422 The organisms may be seen on Brown-Hopps or Giemsa stains and appear as ovoid to ellipsoid spores measuring 2.2 to 2.4 \u00b5m in greatest dimension, with characteristic cross-banding and polar vacuoles.421 A case of hepatitis has also been reported, with sinusoidal congestion and microgranulomas on light microscopy.145 Electron microscopy is necessary to identify the organisms in most cases, but often the organism has already been identified in intestinal biopsy specimens by the time cholangitis develops.

Schistosoma japonicum and Schistosoma mansoni are the two major species associated with hepatic and intestinal schistosomiasis and account for the disease burden in endemic areas.423 Uncommonly, hepatic involvement has also been documented with Schistosoma hematobium, Schistosoma intercalatum, and Schistosoma mekongi. The intermediate host is a population of snails that is not found in North America or Europe.424 Infection occurs when the cercariae exit the snail and penetrate the skin of a vertebrate host. In the human host the cercariae migrate to the lungs, where they mature, reach the left side of the heart, and then are carried to the portal hepatic circulation. In the mesenteric venous plexus, the male occupies the gynecophoric canal of the female, and the worms remain in a state of continuous copulation for their life span of 3 to 5 years.424 Eggs released in the mesenteric venous plexus can migrate to the intestine (intestinal form) or into the liver (hepatosplenic form), where they lodge in the small portal vein tributaries and release antigens that elicit a granulomatous immunologic reaction. Granuloma formation around the eggs leads to pyelophlebitis and periportal fibrosis. S. mansoni eggs are ovoid, measure 140 \u00d7 60 \u00b5m, and have a prominent lateral spine, whereas S. japonicum eggs are smaller and more rounded (100 \u00d7 60 \u00b5m) and have a smaller lateral spine that is often obscured.423 Degenerated eggs may become calcified, which is more commonly seen with S. japonicum than with S. mansoni.",

In humans, these larvae do not develop into adult worms but travel throughout host tissue, primarily liver and lungs; therefore the disease is known as visceral larva migrans.442 Humans acquire the infection by ingesting the eggs from contaminated soil or by eating undercooked meat or other animal tissues (e.g., cow liver) that are infected by the encapsulated larvae. The larvae are released in the intestines, burrow through the intestinal wall, and reach the liver via the portal vein. From there, they travel to various other organs, causing eosinophilic inflammation, granulomas, and abscesses.442 Most patients are asymptomatic but demonstrate peripheral eosinophilia and hypergammaglobulinemia. Vague abdominal pain, fever, cough, and dyspnea are occasional complaints.442 In the United States, visceral toxocariasis affects primarily children between 2 and 7 years old.443 Radiologic studies show multiple, ill-defined, oval or angular hypoechoic lesions that improve or resolve spontaneously, similar to Fasciola hepatica and Capillaria hepatica. The nonspecific radiologic appearance may lead to consideration of other etiologies, such as microabscesses, sarcoidosis, and malignancies.444 Serologic testing for IgG to Toxocara antigens has high sensitivity and specificity and is used to make the diagnosis.",

            "text": "\nC. hepatica is a nematode that mainly affects rodents but is also found in carnivores. The organism requires only a single host, with the liver containing both the adult parasite and its ova.449 Eggs are deposited in soil, where, under favorable conditions, they embryonate. Ingestion of the unembryonated eggs does not result in hepatic disease but only in abdominal discomfort; in these spurious cases, eggs are passed in the stool. Ingestion of embryonated eggs results in hepatic disease; the larvae bore through the intestinal wall and reach the liver via the portal circulation where they mature into adults. Eggs are not passed into stool.449 Infection of humans is rare; children are more commonly affected, probably because of frequent soil-to-mouth contact.449 Patients present with chronic fever, hepatomegaly, and peripheral eosinophilia.450 Imaging may show portal lymphadenopathy and multiple ill-defined, subcentimeter hypodense nodules throughout the liver.451 Liver biopsy specimens may show granulomas and eosinophils. Granulomatous lesions with central eosinophilic necrosis rimmed by palisaded histiocytes and numerous eosinophils similar to toxocariasis may be seen.447, 451, 452, 453, 454 Fibrosis may develop over time. Remnants of the parasite and its eggs may be identified.449 The parasite measures 50 \u00b5m or larger in diameter447 and can be identified by the presence of its internal organs (bacillary bands, esophagus, and associated stichosome).450 The eggs are elliptical, measure 54 to 64 \u00b5m by 29 to 33 \u00b5m, and have a double-layered envelope with an outer striated wall and bipolar plugs (\u201cbioperculated eggs\u201d).449, 450, 453, 454, 455 Serology for Capillaria is not available. Thus, unlike other helminthic diseases in which the diagnosis is made primarily by serology, a definitive diagnosis of hepatic capillariasis requires pathologic identification of the adult or eggs in biopsy material. Serology should still be performed to exclude other infections in the differential diagnosis, particularly toxocariasis.",

The flukes attach to the bile duct epithelium using suckers and cause ductal epithelial proliferation, possibly due to their production of proline.458 Large necrotic granulomas can develop around entrapped eggs, and tissue eosinophilia is typical in these lesions. Adult flukes can be found in the bile ducts or gallbladder, along with stones, hypertrophied muscle coat, and mucosal hyperplasia. Cholangiocarcinoma is not associated with fascioliasis, but development of cirrhosis has been described. Radiologic findings in the chronic phase are nonspecific and may include hepatosplenomegaly, periportal fibrosis, cystic lesions, and calcifications, as well as dilated common bile duct and thickened gallbladder.459 Diagnosis is made with serologic and antigen-identification tests or stool examination for ova, although the latter is useful only in chronic disease and may be negative if ova production is intermittent.456\n",

Bile ducts that harbor these flukes show dilatation, irregular thickening, adenomatous epithelial hyperplasia, and variable eosinophilia (Fig. 11.39\n).459\nOpisthorchis flukes contain an egg-filled branched uterus flanked by paired ceca.461 Eggs are not usually seen in tissues. Ascending cholangitis, usually from E. coli, can lead to purulent exudates in dilated ducts. Bile duct obstruction can result from the worms, strictures, or calculus formation.459 Stones often have dead worms as their nidus. Imaging may show intrahepatic duct dilatation, increased periductal echogenicity, and gallbladder sludge. Diagnosis is made by identifying the ova in stool or by ultrasonography. Infection with O. viverrini or C. sinensis is strongly associated with development of cholangiocarcinoma, which is often intrahepatic, multicentric, and mucin secreting. In fact, O. viverrini is considered a group 1 carcinogen. The mechanisms of carcinogenesis in chlonorchiasis are not well understood but may be multifactorial. Serology does not distinguish between present and past infection. Therefore the diagnosis of active infection may require the detection of ova in stool.459\n",

In North America, patients may present years after travel to an endemic area.471 Compared with pyogenic liver abscesses, amebic abscesses are more likely to be solitary, are more common in men, and tend to occur in younger patients without underlying liver disease or other comorbidities.471, 472 In the United States the disease commonly affects young Hispanic men from southwestern states.",

The biliary epithelium may be reactive or frankly necrotic. Some cases may show prominent periductal \u201conion-skinning\u201d fibrosis with minimal inflammation, indistinguishable from PSC.499 Portal fibrosis and ductular reaction may develop, and progression to biliary-type cirrhosis has been reported.497, 502 Organisms can be detected on the luminal surface of the epithelial lining of small biliary radicles, peribiliary glands, the pancreatic duct, and the gallbladder.147, 498, 501 Concomitant CMV infection may be found.
