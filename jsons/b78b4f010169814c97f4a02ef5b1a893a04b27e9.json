The methodology employed the SEIR Model to characterize the epidemics outbreak and future outcomes. A time-dependent incidence weight on the SEIR reproductive basic number accounts for local Mitigation Policies (MP). The insights gained from analysis of these successful interventions were used to quantify shifts and reductions on active cases, casualties, and estimatives on required medical facilities (ITU). This knowledge can be applied to other Brazilian areas. The analysis was applied to forecast the consequences of releasing the MP over specific periods of time. Herd Immunity (HI) analysis allowed estimating how far we are from reaching the HI threshold value, and the price to be paid.",

Actions across the four pillars complement and support one another. In principle if the virus is left to infect people without any containment measure, the population may acquire immunity in one semester or less. However, hospital intensive care services would lack the capacity to deal with the sudden, large inflow of severely ill people resulting in a very large number of deaths. Mitigation strategies aim to slow the disease, and to reduce the peak in health care demand. This includes policy actions such as social distancing, lock-down determination, and improved personal and environmental hygiene.",

Epidemiological models are commonly stochastic, diffusive-spatial, network based, with heterogeneous sub-populations (meta-population approaches) [2, 3, 4] . However, the parameters of dynamical and deterministic models, such as SIR and SEIR, are more directly related to and interpretable as physical processes [5, 6] . On the other hand, deterministic models impose restrictive analysis, once the dynamics of the host population and the virus are not deterministic. The population has free will, and the virus undergoes \"random\" mutations.",

This model is reasonably predictive for infectious diseases that are transmitted from human to human. In epidemics or pandemic outbreaks, the numbers of susceptible, infected and recovered individuals varies with time (even if the total population size remains constant). For a specific disease in a specific population, these functions may be worked out in order to predict possible outbreaks and bring them under control. For many important viral infections, there is a significant incubation period during which individuals have been infected but are not yet infectious themselves. During this period the individual is in a new compartment E (for exposed) as in the SEIR model.",

This number is difficult to be accepted, so, before a new vaccine becomes available reinforcements of mitigation policy become imperative.",
