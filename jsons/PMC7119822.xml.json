Following primary infection, the virus becomes latent in the sensory neurons of trigeminal/sacral ganglia. During stress or immune suppression, reactivation of the virus occurs and the virion is shed in various body secretions viz. nasal, lachrymal, seminal and genital secretions (Jones et al., 2006; Kutish et al., 1990). The BoHV-1 virus is intermittently excreted in the semen of IBR sero-positive bulls and thus the virus can be transmitted from infected animal to susceptible animal thorough such contaminated semen during natural or artificial insemination (AI) (Mars et al., 2000). Although culling of sero-positive bulls are recommended, it is difficult to follow in many settings. Hence, in such cases it is advocated that each ejaculate of the bull be tested for the absence of BoHV-1 either by real-time PCR or by cell culture. (DADF, 2014; OIE, 2017a).",

FTA\u00ae (Flinders Technology Associates) cards are specially treated filter papers that inactivate the pathogenic bacteria/virus upon contact, thereby allowing safe and easy transport of materials to the laboratory (Muthukrishnan et al., 2008). A number of studies have evaluated use of FTA\u00ae cards for screening of infectious diseases of veterinary importance namely, rabies virus, foot-and-mouth disease virus, newcastle virus, swine influenza virus, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS), avian metapneumovirus, bovine respiratory disease complex (BVDV, BRSV, coronavirus, BoHV-1) (Inoue et al., 2007; Maldonado et al., 2009; Muthukrishnan et al., 2008; Perozo et al., 2006, Picard-Meyer et al., 2007; Prickett et al., 2008; Wacharapluesadee et al., 2003). Most of these studies have shown comparable sensitivity and specificity of detection with samples transported through traditional cold chain. The findings of these studies suggest, FTA\u00ae card can be used as an alternative system of sample transport and storage for nucleic acid based diagnosis. OIE also suggests that FTA\u00ae cards can be used as an alternative system for transport of specimens for detection of rabies virus using molecular techniques (OIE, 2013). However, detection of pathogen from samples spotted onto FTA cards is dependent on several factors viz. nucleic acid concentration in the sample, the inherent stability of nucleic acid and the extraction procedure adopted.",

For extended semen samples spotted onto FTA\u00ae card, overnight DTT treatment step was included before proceeding for the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Briefly, 30 \u03bcL of extended bovine semen was added to the FTA\u00ae card and allowed to dry at room temperature. After complete drying, 10 \u03bcL of 0.1 M DTT was added to each spot and the card was left overnight for drying at room temperature. The next day one disc was punched out from the centre of the area spotted with semen using single hole paper punch (4.5 mm size) and the disc was transferred to a sterile 1.5 ml micro centrifuge tube. The sample disc was then washed by addition of 500 \u03bcL NFW, pulse vortexed for 3 times of 5 s each followed by removal of NFW. This washing step was repeated thrice and the disc was transferred to a fresh 0.6 ml tube. Then 30 \u03bcL of NFW was added to the disc and the tube was incubated in the PCR machine (with heated lid) for 30 min at 98 \u00b0C for elution of DNA. The tube was then pulse vortexed for approximately 60 times of 1 s each followed by brief centrifugation for 15 s. The FTA\u00ae matrix disc was discarded using a sterile pipette tip. The eluate containing DNA was stored at \u221220 \u00b0C.",

A number of experiments were performed with the BoHV-1 virus diluted in MEM to optimize the general procedures for spotting and retrieval of DNA from the FTA\u00ae card viz. quantity of samples to be spotted, the size of the disc to be punched out, the number of discs to be used for extraction, elution volume, temperature and time. The above parameters were decided with reference to the Ct value obtained in the real-time PCR assay for the corresponding samples extracted using Chelex-resin based method. The manufacturer\u2019s protocol for DNA extraction did not result in any amplification in the real-time PCR assay for the BoHV-1 spiked extended semen spotted FTA\u00ae cards. Therefore, additional processing steps in the DNA extraction procedure were attempted to ensure optimum extraction of viral DNA. Four different types of modifications were attempted viz. (i) treatment of the extended semen sample with trypsin prior to spotting, (ii) treatment of punched out disc with lysis buffer (proteinase K and DTT), (iii) pre-treatment of the FTA\u00ae card either with PK + DTT, PK alone or DTT alone before spotting of extended semen; and (iv) treatment with either PK + DTT, PK alone or DTT alone of dried semen spotted FTA\u00ae card. The real-time PCR result suggests all above modifications were successful in ensuring extraction of viral DNA (data not shown). However, the following observations were made. The treatment of extended semen with trypsin resulted in higher Ct value relative to the corresponding sample where DNA was extracted using Chelex resin. The incorporation of lysis solution (PK + DTT) for FTA\u00ae card treatment compromised the integrity of the paper leaving fine paper fibres into the elution. The pre-treatment of cards either with PK + DTT or only DTT before spotting of samples resulted in positive amplification. However, pre-treatment of cards before sample spotting may not be practicable in field settings. The treatment of PK + DTT and DTT alone on the dried semen spot, followed by overnight incubation before proceeding for DNA extraction using manufacturer\u2019s instruction had the desired results. The real-time PCR results of these samples matched that of the results from the corresponding Chelex based DNA extracted samples. Since the treatment with PK + DTT and DTT alone did not have any appreciable difference in the results, the final protocol involved the addition of only DTT (data not shown).",

The result also revealed that, by 15 min the DNAs are eluted and keeping up to 45 min for elution do not have any adverse effect. The treatment of the semen spotted cards with DTT was found necessary as samples processed without DTT addition did not result in DNA amplification. Further, no difference in Ct value was observed for semen spotted onto FTA\u00ae cards treated with different volumes of 0.1 M DTT.

Therefore, as an important quality control step, inclusion of necessary reagents (primers and probe) for the simultaneous detection of housekeeping gene and the target DNA could be considered in further development of the assay (duplex real-time PCR). Wang et al (2007) has evaluated the performance of duplex real-time PCR targeting the gB gene of BoHV-1 and bovine growth hormone (bGH) as internal control and have shown equivalent performance with the individual PCR assays. Alternatively, in place of housekeeping gene, an internal control template (a cryptic DNA) can be spiked to the extended semen spotted FTA\u00ae card during the DTT solution addition step of DNA extraction and the same can be amplified during the real-time PCR.",

To prevent carry over contamination, different procedures for decontamination of the punching device were evaluated. Dipping the punch for one minute in IPA, wiping it dry by tissue paper followed by punching five times on blank sterile filter paper was found effective. This procedure was able to prevent carry-over contamination even at handling 104.8 TCID50/ml BoHV-1 virus spiked in extended bovine semen. This concentration of the virus is not normally expected in clinical samples. Therefore, it can be presumed that serial punching of blank filter paper between samples is adequate for the desired purpose. Further, the filter paper disc from the fifth punch was subjected for DNA extraction, as carry-over contamination control, for every seven sample processed during clinical sample screening. The elution from this disc showed no amplification in the real-time PCR assays.",

The analytical sensitivity of the FTA method matched (100%) with the Chelex method in both virus spiked semen as well as in plasmid spiked semen samples. However, the number of samples found positive varied for the two methods. While the FTA method detected 71 positive samples, the Chelex method detected 65 samples as positive. Both Chelex and FTA method detected 54 samples. The difference in detection between the two methods was noticed when the virus concentration in the clinical sample is low (reflected by higher Ct values of 38\u201340). This can also be corroborated from the observation that when the virus concentration in the extended semen is high (Ct values below 38 or 4\u20136 replicates showing positive amplification in real-time PCR) there is 100% agreement between the two methods. The disparity in the samples declared positive by either of the methods mostly occurred when positive amplification was recorded in only one or two of the six replicates (Ct values 38\u201340). Linhares et al. (2012) observed 100% sensitivity and specificity of FTA method for detection of PRRSV in serum, blood, tissue samples of experimentally infected animals.
