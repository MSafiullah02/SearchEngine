Immunotherapy shows promise in the treatment of multiple cancers and may further improve outcomes in breast cancer. Increasing evidence suggests breast cancer is more immunogenic than once realized, particularly given the important prognostic role that the host immune response and tumor microenvironment play [1\u20133]. Immune-mediated surveillance and clearance of disease likely plays an important role in preventing recurrence in clinically disease-free patients after standard of care therapy. Cancer vaccines may help generate a tumor-specific immunity to prevent disease recurrence.",

Clinically disease-free node positive and high-risk node negative breast cancer patients were enrolled one to six months after completion of primary standard of care therapy with the exception of adjuvant endocrine therapy which was allowed concurrently. High-risk node negative patients were defined if they had any of the following: as \u2265 T2, grade 3, lymphovascular invasion, estrogen or progesterone receptor negative, HER2 over-expressing tumor (IHC 3+ and/or amplified FISH > 2.0, before CAP/ASCO guideline changes), or N0 (i+) breast cancer patients with any level of HER2 expression (IHC 1\u20133+ and/or positive FISH > 1.2). HLA-A2 positive patients were assigned to either the GP2 or AE37 arms of the trial, both given in combination with granulocyte\u2013macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in the treatment groups or GM-CSF alone in the control group. HLA-A2 negative patients were randomized to receive either AE37 in combination with GM-CSF in the treatment group or GM-CSF alone in the control group.",

In addition, the DFS were compared between all four arms of the trial. Based on our previous trials with nelipepimut-S, the difference in recurrence was 15% in controls compared with 6% in the vaccinated patients at a median follow-up of 2 years [9]. Based on this data, the trial was designed to detect a 0.48 hazard ratio corresponding to an improvement in 2-year DFS from 85% for GM-CSF control to 93% for vaccine (AE37 and GP2). A sample size of 150 subjects per group had 80% power to detect the difference at a 1-sided alpha level of 0.05 using a log-rank test for equality of survival curves. The total number of events required to achieve the specified power was 33. A sample size of 100 subjects per group would have the same power to detect a statistical difference between groups with a hazard ratio of 0.35.",

We found that both the CD8+ CTL-eliciting GP2 and the CD4 + T helper cell-eliciting AE37 vaccines are safe with limited toxicity that is primarily due to the GM-CSF immunoadjuvant and not the individual peptides [7, 17]. Furthermore, while the overall DFS does not appear to be improved in the ITT population, multiple subsets may derive some benefit based on pre-specified exploratory analyses. Interestingly, the responding patient subsets to GP2 and AE37 are very different suggesting the potential to target specific patients and/or combining the peptides to address a broader patient population. A current limitation of this analysis is the per-treatment nature possibly affecting the external validity of the data; although, the number of patients excluded from the ITT to PT analysis was small (n = 27, 5.9% overall of patients). Even with the exclusion of these early recurrence and second malignancy patients, there was still no significant differences between the group demographics.",

Breast cancer subtypes similarly have distinct immunologic characteristics. The TNBC subtype appears to have the greatest amount of immune infiltration, followed by the highly-proliferative estrogen receptor positive subtype. Meanwhile, the low-grade, estrogen receptor positive, luminal A subtype appears to have the lowest infiltration rate [20]. This recognition is of increasing clinical importance, not only because of the recent rise of immunotherapy to the forefront of cancer care, but also because tumor immune characteristics can also be prognostic in breast cancer [21].",

            "text": "The data from this analysis suggest that the GP2 peptide vaccine may be beneficial in patients with HER2 over-expressing tumors who received trastuzumab as part of their standard of care treatment. This supports the hypothesis that GP2 may have synergistic clinical efficacy when combined with trastuzumab [22]. Previous preclinical work by Mittendorf et al. demonstrated that HER2 receptors on the tumor cell surface can be saturated by treatment with trastuzumab, promoting internalization in a time and dose-dependent manner. Trastuzumab increased the sensitivity of the tumor cells to CTL-mediated lysis after stimulation with either nelipepimut-S or GP2, even in patients with low levels of HER2 expression. Interestingly, they also found peripheral blood lymphocytes lyse trastuzumab-treated breast cancer cells more efficiently after nelipepimut-S vaccination. We are currently investigating the possibility of a synergistic immunologic effect when nelipepimut-S is given in combination with trastuzumab in a phase II trial in HER2 over-expressing (3+ by IHC; NCT02297698). We recently completed a trial in low-expressing HER2 (IHC 1\u20132+) patients and found the greatest clinical benefit in DFS in patients with TNBC, suggesting a synergistic mechanism in this population [23]. In addition to the potential synergy with trastuzumab, GP2 may be inherently more effective in the HER2 over-expressing population. These patients have increased HER2 expression, their immune system has greater exposure to this tumor-associated antigen. Given that GP2 is a subdominant epitope of HER2, there may be less immune tolerance to this epitope than a dominant epitope, such as nelipepimut-S. This likely allows GP2 to be more effective in HER2 over-expressing disease; where nelipepimut-S may be more effective in HER2 low-expressing patients [9].",

AE37 has been shown to induce CD4+ T helper cell stimulation which is required for the effective generation of long-term cell-mediated immunity [24, 25].

AE37 is able to directly stimulate the HLA-DR alleles with epitopes present in the HER2 protein. The immunologic effect of AE37 vaccination has also been shown to increase IFN-\u03b3 + CD4 + responder cells which in turn assists in strong in vivo and in vitro autologous CTL lysing of tumor cells [28, 29].

A similar finding was demonstrated in a HER2 peptide derived vaccine on a dendritic cell platform that stimulates both CD8+ and CD4+ T cells. This MHC class 2 vaccine was also given in combination with anti-PD-1 therapy and demonstrated improved survival in a preclinical model [30]. It is worth exploring future trials of combinations of check point inhibitors and peptide-based vaccine strategies to improve DFS. While the potential for CTL-mediated, anti-tumor cytolytic effect via peptide vaccines like nelipepimut-S and GP2 certainly provide promise as a potential stand-alone weapon in the fight against cancer, the CTL effects are limited temporally given the natural transient course of such cytotoxic immune responses. Thus, a vaccine that combines CTL and T helper cell targeted peptides may not only induce the more immediate CTL-mediated cytolytic response against any occult residual disease, but also induce T helper cell-mediated long-term immunologic memory to protect against tumor recurrence.",

While neither vaccine demonstrated a statistically significant DFS benefit in the overall study population, there are signals of benefit in certain subpopulations of breast cancer patients. This is, perhaps, not surprising given distinct differences in terms of prognosis and treatment response in the different subtypes of breast cancer.
