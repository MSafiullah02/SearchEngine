            "text": "The ubiquitous adenine nucleoside adenosine (Ado) plays a major role in cellular metabolism and energetics. The levels of extracellular Ado are determined by its release from cells under physiologic and pathophysiologic conditions as well as the degradation of extracellular adenosine 5\u2032-triphosphate (ATP) by ectoenzymes, CD39 and CD73 in particular (Zimmermann 2000; Zimmermann et al. 2012). Extracellular Ado is eliminated from the extracellular space by ecto-adenosine deaminase (ADA) (Franco et al. 1997) and active Ado transporters that transport Ado into cells (Thorn and Jarvis 1996). Extracellular Ado acts as an autocrine and paracrine agent, the effects of which are mediated by four different G protein-coupled receptors: A1, A2a, A2b, and A3 (A1AdoR, A2aAdoR, A2bAdoR, and A3AdoR, respectively). These receptors, which are expressed to various degrees by different cell types throughout the body including the lungs (Burnstock et al. 2012; Zhou et al. 2009), manifest variable affinity to Ado (Fredholm et al. 2001). AdoR are coupled to cascades of intracellular cellular-response pathways, mainly through the activation or inhibition of adenylate cyclase and the subsequent alteration of intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels (Karmouty-Quintana et al. 2013). The activation of AdoR can lead to both pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory effects, depending on the type of receptor and the experimental setting (Schepp and Reutershan 2008).",

            "text": "In the early 1980s, Holgate and his colleagues have shown for the first time that inhaled Ado induces bronchoconstriction in asthmatic but not healthy human subjects and that this action was mediated mainly by histamine released from lung mast cells and not by a pulmonary-pulmonary central vagal reflex triggered by Ado (Cushley et al. 1983; Mann et al. 1985; Church and Holgate 1993). Since then, data obtained in numerous studies have shown that Ado plays important roles in pulmonary physiology and pathophysiology (Caruso et al. 2006; Polosa and Blackburn 2009; Caruso et al. 2009). One characteristic of acute lung injury (ALI) is elevated Ado levels in the lung, which activate anti-inflammatory and tissue-protective mechanisms (Zhou et al. 2009; Karmouty-Quintana et al. 2013; Gonzales et al. 2014). Specifically, initial activation of AdoR blunts the production of multiple cytokines, decreases inflammatory cell infiltration, and preserves pulmonary vascular barrier function (Eckle et al. 2009). Similarly, Ado exerted a protective anti-inflammatory effect in an in vitro model of lung transplantation/ischemia-reperfusion model (Smail et al. 2016). In contrast, sustained AdoR activation results in pro-inflammatory effects, e.g., increased cytokine production and inflammatory cell infiltration (Zhou et al. 2009). This conundrum of the Ado\u2019s dual nature has stymied the development of new drugs aimed at the modulation of AdoR signal transductions.",

Subsequent in vivo studies using a mouse model have shown that physiologic doses of Ado decrease alveolar fluid clearance (AFC), probably by means of an A1AdoR-dependent mechanism that causes Cl\u2212 efflux through CFTR, whereas lower doses increased AFC via the A2aR and/or A3R (Factor et al. 2007). Similarly, alcohol decreases alveolar fluid clearance and impairs survival from acute lung injury. Alcohol induced increases Ado levels in the lung, which may be responsible for reduction in AFC and associated worsening of lung injury (Dada et al. 2012).",

Indeed, A1AdoR has been implicated in polymorphonuclear cell trafficking and alterations in microvascular permeability in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced lung injury model (Ngamsri et al. 2010). A more recent study in a mouse model has shown that A1AdoR activation improves lung function and decreases inflammation, edema, and neutrophil chemotaxis after ischemia-reperfusion (Fernandez et al. 2013a). This protective effect of A1AdoR\u2019s activation agrees with the finding that pulmonary injury was exacerbated in ADA double-knockout mice, which is also deficient in the expression of A1AdoR (Sun et al. 2005). Similarly, an A1AdoR agonist significantly increased lung compliance and oxygenation and decreased pulmonary artery pressure, decreased neutrophil infiltration by myeloperoxidase activity and edema, and reduced tumor necrosis factor-alpha production in an isolated, ventilated, blood-perfused rabbit lung model of ischemia-reperfusion (Gazoni et al. 2010).",

Extracellular Ado promote dermal fibrosis (Fernandez et al. 2013b), and the activation of A2BAdoR promoted renal fibrosis in both mice infused with angiotensin II and mice subjected to unilateral ureteral obstruction (Dai et al. 2011). A study in a mouse model of bleomycin-induced injury and whole-lung lysate from patients without and with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis has shown that inhibition of hypoxia-inducible factor 1-\u03b1 (HIF1\u03b1) attenuated pulmonary fibrosis in association with reductions in A2BAdoR expression in alternatively activated macrophages (Philip et al. 2017). These data were interpreted to suggest that hypoxia, through HIF1\u03b1, contributes to the development and progression of pulmonary fibrosis through its regulation of A2BAdoR expression on alternatively activated macrophages (AAMs), cell differentiation, and production of profibrotic mediators (Philip et al. 2017).",

SDF-1 is expressed in the human lung during acute lung injury (Petty et al. 2007). The effects of SDF-1 are mediated by two receptors: CXCR4 and CXCR7 (Rath et al. 2014), the inhibition of which results in an anti-inflammatory effect during ALI (Konrad et al. 2017). Using a mouse model of ALI and an in vitro preparation of human epithelium/endothelium, it was found that the anti-inflammatory effects of CXCR4 and CXCR7 antagonism in terms of PMN migration, chemokine release, and microvascular permeability are linked to adenosine A2BAdoR signaling in hematopoietic cells (Konrad et al. 2017).",

Low and high concentrations of Ado enhanced and suppressed, respectively, the release of histamine from Fc\u03b5RI-stimulated HLMC; this action was mediated by A3AdoR (Gomez et al. 2011). The dose-dependent contrasting effects of Ado on histamine release associated with an allergic reaction were confirmed in a subsequent study using cultured HLMC (Nishi et al. 2016). Rudich et al. examined whether the activation of A3AdoR modulates rather than mediates the effects of Ado in human mast cells, presumably at a transcriptional level (Rudich et al. 2015). Using the HMC-1 cell line, Rudich et al. found that A3AdoR activation represses the expression of genes involved in tissue remodeling and that is coupled to downregulation of the receptor expression, both at protein and mRNA levels (Rudich et al. 2015). Furthermore, since in this study, dexamethasone, a commonly prescribed asthma medication, exerted a synergistic signal that increased Cl-IB-MECA induced gene upregulation and facilitated cytokine secretion, it was speculated that this interaction might underlie the resistance to corticosteroids that is experienced in severe refractory asthma (Rudich et al. 2015).",

Specifically, it seems that even in the acute phase of injury, the resulting effects of elevated extracellular Ado levels critically depend on the targeted cell type and the localized Ado level at the receptors\u2019 sites.
