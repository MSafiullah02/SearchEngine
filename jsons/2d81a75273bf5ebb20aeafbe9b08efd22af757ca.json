Furthermore, surgical lessons from combat and trauma can be broadly applied via focused empiricism, an agile surgical approach based on prioritization, resource allocation, and continuous performance improvement. 1 That is, the COVID-19 pandemic represents a mass casualty event on both local and global scales.",

During this response, there have been calls to halt elective procedures within hospitals in the interests of resource preservation. Through this lens, however, \"elective\" can often be a misnomer. We must acknowledge that many \"elective\" procedures are not truly electiveethey are scheduled and, though many are generally not emergency nor urgent, many are medically necessary and time-sensitive (MN-TS). Furthermore, these patients' conditions or prognoses may deteriorate without timely intervention. What is needed is a pragmatic approach whereby any MN-TS procedure should proceed provided bed space, staffing, and supplies to deliver high-quality care are available. Ambulatory surgery centers generally have no inpatient capacity and can be used to offload less invasive (but still MN-TS) procedures, thereby preserving hospital resources. Surgery on \u00feCOVID-19 patients should be deferred, if not absolutely necessary, until they have been asymptomatic for 72 hours and have at least 2 negative COVID-19 tests separated by at least 24 hours. Operative procedures should ideally be performed in a filtered, negative-pressure room. 2 ",

We cannot deal with a prolonged mass casualty event when many of our staff are sidelined owing to quarantine or illness. Above and beyond standard precautions, this specific type of pandemic requires screening outpatients for symptoms and testing before entering hospitals, seeing only outpatients with MN-TS concerns, and avoiding burnout and unprotected exposure to infected patients. Leveraging telehealth encounters can improve both provider and patient safety and can lead to excellent patient satisfaction. Standard precautions are not only indicated for any encounter with a person under investigation or a \u00feCOVID-19 patient, but should also be considered for quarantined patients, personal protective equipment (PPE) availability permitting. Social distancing applies to the workplace as well, and, therefore, routine gatherings, such as meetings, academics, morning report, etc, should be cancelled or converted to tele-or video conferences. These practices avoid the \"COVID-19 grenade,\" whereby 1 staff member becomes positive and sidelines critical portions of the workforce.",

Airborne precaution-level PPE is advocated for OR staff during induction and intubation/extubation of even non-COVID-19 patients, owing to the potential for asymptomatic transmission and aerosolization. 2 This practice should include N95 masks with face shield or powered air-purifying respirator in a negative-pressure environment. Furthermore, staff not actively participating in patient care owing to curtailed routine clinic and OR activities should be at home. They are not quarantined, but they are on the proverbial \"bench\" to act as a potential ready reserve if needed. Quarantine periods for both staff and patients who have been exposed to any person under investigation have been set provisionally at 14 days; however, in a critical staffing shortage, it is reasonable to return staff to work after 8 to 9 days of quarantine provided they are symptomfree. In some situations, this requirement, including a negative COVID-19 test, might be waived altogether owing to crisis-level shortages in staffing. In the extreme scenario in which a staff member with a COVID-19 positive test is asked to come back to work, the staffer should at the very least be symptom-free for no less than 72 hours and, upon return, should wear a mask and practice good hand hygiene.",
