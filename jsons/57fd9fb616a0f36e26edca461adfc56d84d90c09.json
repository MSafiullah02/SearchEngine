They describe a type L characterized by a low elastance, a low ventilation to perfusion ratio, a low lung weight and a low lung recruitability. Worsening patients are supposed to progress from type L to type H. Type H is characterized by a high elastance, a high right-to-left shunt, a high lung weight and a high lung recruitability. As Gattinoni and colleagues complete their editorial, \"understanding the correct pathophysiology is crucial to establishing the basis for appropriate treatment\".",

For the first patient, who died early in its disease course after withdrawing of treatment, 5 days after the beginning of fever, we found a lymphocytic viral pneumonia ( Fig. 1a ) that could be considered as type L. For five other patients, who died later in their disease course, around 20 days after the beginning of symptoms with a phenotype H, the histologic pattern was an acute fibrinous and organizing pneumonia (AFOP), characterized by an extensive intra-alveolar fibrin deposition called fibrin \u00abballs\u00bb, rather than hyaline membranes. Organizing pneumonia consisting of intraluminal loose connective tissue was observed within the alveolar ducts and bronchioles associated with the fibrinous acute injury (Fig. 1b) . Fibroblastic bodies and fibroblasts surrounding intra-alveolar fibrin were seen in all cases (Fig. 1c) , as well as a moderate interstitial T-cell lymphocytic, a plasma cells infiltrate, and type 2 pneumocyte hyperplasia with cytologic atypia. Vascular injury was also a prominent feature readily, demonstrated by endothelial injury with cytoplasmic vacuolization and cell detachment in small to medium-sized pulmonary arteries (1D).",
