RecBCD is a multifunctional enzyme complex that processes DNA ends resulting from a double-strand break. It is a bipolar helicase that splits the duplex into its two component strands and digests them until it encounters a recombinant hotspot or Chi site. The structure showed intriguing features that provided structural clues on how the complex is able to (1) spread open the two strands of DNA resulting in a fork by a prominent pin and (2) feed the two separate ssDNA strands into separate tunnels that emerge next to the nuclease domain of RecB. The structure also suggested mechanisms for the regulation of such a complex process (Singleton et al., 2004).",

Structures at high resolution of elongation factors EF-G and EF-Tu complexed with GDP or analogs (GDPNP) as well as specific mutants (e.g., T84A) are providing valuable information, but not enough to provide a complete picture. He pointed out the limitations of the structures of the so-called complete ribosomes, indicating that L1 and L11 are missing from them, and showed how the 15N-labeled NMR spectra of 70S E. coli ribosomes can help to locate the L7/L12 components in the structure of the intact ribosome. He suggested a more integrated, five-pronged approach where X-ray, NMR, cryoEM, theoretical (computational) chemistry, and physical chemistry would be needed to understand the most complex problems in molecular biology. The most complete developments in understanding biological processes at the molecular level have been discussed in a recent symposium (Von Heijne and Liljas, 2005), and Anders has reviewed the structural aspects of protein synthesis in a recent book (Liljas, 2004).",

Tomitake discussed the structural evidence supporting the controversial proton transfer across the peptide bond and the electron transfer path from the carbonyl of Ser441 to heme a3 and through the helical bulge H378-F377-H376 to the outside. The high-resolution structures (1.8/1.9 \u00c5 in the fully oxidized/reduced states) showed that the net positive charge created upon oxidation of the low-spin heme of the enzyme drives the active proton transport from the interior of the mitochondria to Asp51 on the enzyme surface. During the reverse reaction, enzyme reduction induces proton ejection from the aspartate to the mitochondrial exterior. Given the sheer size of the oxidase (13 subunits), and the complexity of the reaction catalyzed by this enzyme, one is constantly reminded of the subtlety of the conformational changes required to transfer protons or electrons by such a large multimeric enzyme across the mitochondrial membrane (Tsukihara et al., 1996, Tsukihara et al., 2003).",

Alwyn Jones (Institute of Cell and Molecular Biology, Uppsala, Sweden), in his inimitable style, captured the audience with his recollections of the impact of the early days of computer graphics on macromolecular crystallography. He visited Purdue in 1980 with the special mission of adapting FRODO to the then-new MMSX hardware, which proved to be full of challenges, not the least of those was to survive MGR\u2019s anxiety about the entire project.",

Burnett (Wistar Institute and University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia), MGR\u2019s first (surviving) graduate student, discussed the evolutionary implications of the finding that the structure of the major coat protein (P3) of bacteriophage PRD1 (Benson et al., 1999) resembles that of the human adenovirus hexon (Rux et al., 2003). As their names indicate, these two DNA viruses with pseudo-T=25 virions infect two very different hosts. PRD1 infects gram-negative bacteria while human adenoviruses do not contain a membrane and can cause pathological conditions in animals ranging from fish to humans. Based on the structural features of the viral coat proteins containing the \u201cdouble-barrel trimer\u201d motif, Roger argued that viruses infecting bacteria could be related by evolution to those infecting animal hosts. Using structure-based modeling, he presented data suggesting that other large viruses, infecting members of the three domains of life eukarya, bacteria, and archea, may have coats constructed in a similar manner and using the same motif (Benson et al., 2004).",

            "text": "Jack Johnson (Scripps Institute, California) presented the results of several structural techniques (i.e., crystallography, SAXS, and intrinsic capsid fluorescence) to illuminate the nature of particle maturation in the bacteriophage HK97. The structure of the capsid of this virus (T=7) was described as a \u201cmolecular balloon,\u201d because the particle diameter ranges in the icosahedral shell from 540 to 630 \u00c5, but the thickness of the shell is only 18 \u00c5. However, the capsule is extremely rigid due to the presence of cross-linked rings between Lys-Asn amino acid residues in the viral shell. Those characteristics implied that the virus has to undergo a multistep maturation process concomitant with structural changes, the most dramatic being the change from prohead to EI-1 (expansion intermediate I). Jack presented combined evidence suggesting that this pH-dependent transition takes place for a single virus particle within the time scale of approximately 1 s and appeared to be a stochastic process. His metaphor of a \u201cpopcorn-like,\u201d binary transition caught my attention and found its way to my notes (Wikoff et al., 2000, Lee et al., 2004).",

In closing, he emphasized once again what he wrote in the Foreword to Crystals and Life (Abad-Zapatero, 2002): \u201cIt has been my privilege to host and work with many pre- and postdoctoral students with vastly different cultural backgrounds during almost 40 years at Purdue University in Indiana. We have together enjoyed the pleasures of discovery and agonized over disappointments.\u201d I think that I can speak for the majority of the attendees to the symposium when I say: \u201cMichael, it has been our privilege to work with you and to experience the pleasures of discovery and the agonies and anguish of the temporary failures along the way. You have enriched our personal and professional lives immensely.\u201d",

On the side, she was always producing pottery masterpieces to mark each scientific milestone of the laboratory or the departure of friends or coworkers. The attendees flocked to University Place to present their tribute, friendship, and homage to her.
