However, with the progression of the COVID-19 epidemic, by April 1, 2020, 75,948 cases had been confirmed by the World Health Organization, and 36,571 deaths from the outbreak had been declared. Face masks can prevent human-to-human aerosol transmission of such infections effectively2,3; thus, Asian countries such as China, South Korea, and Japan encourage the public to wear face masks in public areas.",
