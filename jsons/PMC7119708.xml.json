            "text": "Cells of the monocyte-macrophage lineage are important effectors and regulators of the immune response and also serve as target cells for replication of a number of viruses. Their infection can thus play an important role in the pathogenesis of a number of viral diseases. For example, macrophages are the only target cells for porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus (PRRSV) (Rossow, 1998) and are the primary targets for African swine fever virus (ASFV) (Malmquist and Hay, 1960, Minguez et al., 1988). A number of other viruses that infect pigs, such as classical swine fever virus (CSFV), porcine circovirus 1 (PCV-1) (Mc Neilly et al., 1996), and porcine circovirus 2 (PCV-2) (Morozov et al., 1998, Kiupel et al., 1998) also replicate in cells of monocyte/macrophage lineage. Work was initiated to establish an immortalized porcine monocyte/macrophage cell line that could be used for propagation and study of selected porcine viruses. The availability of such a cell line would facilitate the isolation and study of these viruses by eliminating reliance on primary cell cultures, difficult to establish and standardize. For example, field strains of PRRSV and ASFV are currently isolated using porcine primary macrophages which are not only difficult to establish but cannot be frozen reliably for long term storage and use. More importantly, it has been shown that the phenotype of porcine monocytic cells at the time of isolation can be heterogeneous (McCullough et al., 1993) which, in turn, may effect the efficiency of ASFV replication. In order to overcome these difficulties, a combination of porcine alveolar macrophages and MA-104 cells has been recommended for the isolation of PRRSV (Benfield et al., 1999). A continuous porcine monocytic cell line with the potential to differentiate into macrophage type cells, would also be a valuable tool for viral pathogenesis and immune function studies. For these reasons, we sought to develop a continuous porcine monocyte/macrophage cell line and to determine its susceptibility to selected viruses.",

We hypothesized that by cultivation in the maintenance medium partial differentiation of the cells was achieved, based on phenotypic changes such as attachment to polystyrene surfaces, increase in the non-specific esterase and phagocytic activity. This is consistent with the work of others (Kreutz et al., 1992), who have shown that serum factors can induce partial maturation of primary monocytes in vitro. However, the degree of differentiation was not sufficient to ensure replication of PRRSV and satisfactory replication of field isolates of ASFV. We have therefore attempted to further differentiate/mature the cells by adding PMA or DMSO to medium containing FBS (Denholm and Stankus, 1995), or by using PorS supplemented medium (McCullough et al., 1999).",

Two other findings suggest that the 3D4/2, 3D4/21 and 3D4/31 cells reached only intermediate state of differentiation in porcine serum: (1) high level of CD14 expression on their surface which is an indicator of monocyte-type cells (McCullough et al., 1997); and (2) relatively high proportion of the 3D4/2, 3D4/21 and 3D4/31 cells displaying non-specific esterase activity (Basta et al., 1999).

The cells supported replication of wide range of viruses, and may have the potential to support replication of monocytotropic viruses, which require mature-type cells for replication. Although the three cell lines have similar characteristics, they differ in the degree they support replication of some viruses, and in the degree they respond to differentiating agents. The ease of manipulation of these cells and the above mentioned biological characteristics make them potentially suitable for viral diagnostic and immunopathology applications.",
