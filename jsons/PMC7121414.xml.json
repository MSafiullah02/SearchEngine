The cardinal features are acute clinical worsening (<30 days) in a patient with known or newly diagnosed IPF with acceleration of dyspnea and/or hypoxemia and new radiologic changes, typically ground glass opacities, on a background of fibrotic disease (example Fig. 30.1) [1, 2]. The underlying pathologic insult is classically described as diffuse alveolar damage [3], the histologic finding of ARDS, which has been superimposed on usual interstitial pneumonia. Common concomitant symptoms mimic a viral lower respiratory tract infection with fever, malaise, flu like symptoms and cough; though these symptoms are not needed to make the diagnosis [1, 2]. Infection is the chief differential diagnosis. Ideally, infection is excluded by bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) as in the case presentation; however given the worsening hypoxemia in addition to typical poor baseline pulmonary health a BAL may precipitate a life-threatening impairment in gas exchange. If the lower airways cannot be sampled by BAL, treatment for typical bacterial organisms or hospital acquired organisms if applicable are employed presumptively. If structural lung disease exists (as most patients usually have traction bronchiectasis) it may be worthwhile to treat Pseudomonas on an empiric basis. Other conditions that need to be excluded are pneumothorax, pulmonary hypertension, left ventricular failure from systolic or diastolic dysfunction, pulmonary embolism, or acute respiratory distress syndrome of other known causes (i.e. sepsis, pancreatitis, trauma, pneumonia. For more detail see Chap. 10.1007/978-3-319-43341-7_21). Cross-sectional imaging is used to rule out small pneumothorax not seen as well as to confirm radiologic changes, which usually are ground glass in appearance, but dense infiltrates can also be seen. A CT pulmonary angiogram has the advantage of evaluating for pulmonary embolus in patients without renal failure.",

However diagnosis and management of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is usually the realm of the pulmonologist. Ensuring that the patient has an accurate diagnosis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis is critical to determining prognosis for the underlying condition. Fibrotic lung disease associated with collagen-vascular disease, such as polymyositis, has also been associated with acute exacerbations, and may have a better prognosis [13]. Many pulmonologists who are less familiar with interstitial lung diseases often incorrectly attribute all types of lung fibrosis to idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis [14]. Given the disparate outcomes, accurate discrimination of IPF from other fibrotic lung diseases is critical. Clues on CT scan suggesting the diagnosis of IPF are lower lung, subpleural predominance of interlobular septal thickening with honeycombing and traction bronchiectasis (see Fig. 30.1) [11]. In IPF patients without an acute exacerbation, ground glass infiltrates should be minimal [11]. Clinical findings should include a conspicuous absence of inhalational exposures and rheumatologic conditions as well as presence of \u201cvelcro\u201d rales. If the diagnosis is in doubt, consultation with a pulmonary specialist with experience in interstitial lung disease is recommended.",
