For this reason, we have very little information about its genetic material as well as structures of different proteins. Fortunately, in recent time, structure of CoV Mpro protein of 2019-nCoV has been determined using x-ray crystallography [18]. It is interesting to observe that the amino acid sequence of SARC-CoV-2 Mpro protein of 2019-nCoV is highly different from the previously known CoV Mpro. This mutation produces a novel variety of the protein with same activities. The change in the secondary and tertiary structure of the protein is clearly noticeable in the overlying picture of mutant (pink, pdb id: 6lu7) and one of the known protein [19] (cyan; pdb id: 2q6f) is shown below (Fig. 1a). The huge change of the mutant protein in almost every region of it is a key cause for the drug resistance. It creates the scope of development of new compounds against 2019-nCoV.",

This is the reason why the class of compounds are often utilised in place of flavones. From the structural point of view, compound 2 has some advantages over 1. In the case of 2, the \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated ketone is more reactive for its exo-cyclic nature and the lack of conjugation with ring oxygen atom (Fig. 2b, structure 2). The presence of exo-cyclic C=C double bond at C3 without the previous type of conjugation enhances its reactivity and allows the compound 2 for facile Michael reaction at the C11 position. Therefore, there is a chance of compound 2 as Michel acceptor during interaction with amino acid residue (Cys145 and His41) at the active site of the protein. These are the reasons for the choice of compound 2 as the best possible lead moiety in this study and compounds 2e-i were also be considered to explore the electronic features of 2 and it is discussed later.",

            "text": "It is widely accepted that the molecular recognition between protein and small molecules (ligand) occurs at their surfaces. Hence, the extent of binding forces in the protein-ligand complex depends on two factors, electronic distribution and the shape of the surface of the ligand. These can be predicted from the molecular electrostatic potential surface of the energy-minimised geometry of a molecule by calculating Wang\u2013Ford charges of all atoms [22, 23]. In MEP surface, electronegative atoms show negative values (red, hydrogen bonding acceptor) of charge, and it is positive in value for electron-poor atoms (blue, hydrogen bonding donor). The atoms with zero values (green, \u03c0- and other types of staking interactions) are neutral in nature. This molecular detail helps to predict how much they are potential to take part in chemical reaction and to realise their mechanism of interactions. In addition to this, the surfaces provide the lower limit of the proximity of two molecules which describe the steric feature of the molecule [24]. Therefore, the quantum mechanically calculated properties of an energy minimised molecular geometry help to understand the steric, electronic feature and nature of binding forces of molecules.",

            "text": "The MEP of compounds 2a-i show that these molecules are capable to form at least two hydrogen bonds (red patches) during protein binding with the help of ketone and chromanone ring oxygen except 2g (contain S atom in the place of oxygen) and 2h (Fig. 3). The electron density ring A of chromanone is quite higher (green to yellow) due to electron donation ring oxygen through conjugation which can favour the \u03c0-staking interaction with aromatic amino acid residues. This effect is enhanced in 2g for the presence of less electronegative atom sulphur in the ring. It is possible to manipulate the electron density at the benzylidene ring and C11 position by adding different functional groups at the benzylidene part. Incorporation of oxygen containing functional groups (OMe) at benzylidene part (2b, 2e and 2h) increases the electron density to the ring (Fig. 3). This enhancement of electron density is also favourable for the \u03c0-staking interaction. The case becomes more interesting for halogens because the single atom occupies a large electron density surface with negative values which is also suitable also for multiple \u03c0-staking interactions as well as halogen bonding. However, the halogen atoms at this part are unable to influence the electronic behaviour of the ring (green for 2c, 2d and 2g). Therefore, it is expected that these compounds may interact strongly with proteins. In the case of compound 2f, the electron rich oxygen in the furan ring polarises the ring electron cloud towards itself. The compound can bind strongly by hydrogen bonding. The extended conjugated hydrophobic benzylidene system is 2i and is very slightly electron rich with a large surface area (Fig. 3). Therefore, small red, yellow and blue patches on the large green surface of compounds are balancing the hydrophilic and hydrophobic parts which are essential for good binding to the protein.",

Lone pair \u03c0-staking between M49 and M165 with Cl containing phenyl ring is also an interesting case. The chlorine is in hydrophobic interactions with C44, M49, P52 and Y54 residues. The \u03c0 H-N interactions between H163 and thiochromanone benzene ring as well as CH2 hydrogen and H41 are also found (Fig. 5b).",

            "text": "The docking study also provides an opportunity to design these compounds in its next level. There is a possibility of rotation of the C\u2013C bond designated by cyan colour in Fig. 5b. This bond rotation can bring the grey-coloured carbon atoms of benzylidene ring closer to the amide carbonyl groups of R188 and Q189 residues (Fig. 5b). Hydroxyl group substitution of the hydrogen atoms at the mentioned positions can involve in hydrogen bonding with the amino acid residue. The grey-coloured carbon atom at thiochromanone ring is closer to P140 and the carboxyl group of E166. Replacement of the attached hydrogen at the marked carbon by NH2 group may render it capable of hydrogen bonding and ionic interactions. If these substitutions occur, the compound 2j can come into existence (Fig. 6a). All the above studies are also performed for the 2j, and it is found that the compound is sufficiently hydrophobic (log P values are in Table S1). The presence of two hydroxyl groups and one amino group reduces the log S values (ESOL log S = \u2212 3.62, Ali log S = \u2212 4.41 and Silicos-IT log Sw = \u2212 4.25) slightly and enhances its water solubility. The compound has high gastrointestinal absorbance without BBB permeability. The compound may behave as Pgp substrate with low skin absorbability (log Kp = \u2212 6.37 cm/s). The compound 2j has the same bioavailability score (0.55) with other and low synthetic accessibility (3.29). Therefore, the designed new compound is well in the pharmacokinetic point of view also.",

The appearance of dark blue patch in the region of the amine group of 2j on the MEP surface is clue for strong hydrogen bonding. The docking of the compound with all the CoV Mpro proteins shows that the compound 2j binds more strongly with the protein than that of 2g in each case. The increment in docking score of 2j (\u2212 7.88, \u2212 7.21, \u2212 6.31 and \u2212 7.13 for the protein with pdb id 6lu7, 2q6f, 2q6d and 2h2z, respectively) is slight which can be because of the compensation of the loss of the huge number of interactions for the elimination of Cl group of 2g by the stabilizing hydrogen bonging of OH and amine groups of 2j with amino acid residues of the protein. Inside the active site, the attached amine and hydroxyl groups of 2j form expected hydrogen bonding interactions as mentioned earlier (Fig. 6b). In addition to this, the hydrogen bonding between the ketone oxygen of 2j and E166 amino acid residue (1.94 \u00c5) is also observed here. Sulphur-\u03c0 (M94 and 165) and \u03c0-\u03c0 (H41) staking interactions are found with OH containing ring and N-H-\u03c0 (H163) found at thiochromanone ring.

It is very complicatedly related to the patients and show dependency on the type of compounds used, its doses as well as their interaction with the stage of infection. One of the primary tasks in drug discovery is to find a molecule with the least toxicity or non-toxicity from all aspects [38]. Therefore, the prediction of the toxicity of the molecules under investigation is also an essential part of this study. Here, we have judged all these molecules in different toxicity parameters. In this study, we have considered cardiotoxicity, organ toxicity (hepatotoxicity), toxicity endpoints (carcinogenicity, immunotoxicity, mutagenicity and cytotoxicity), nuclear receptor signaling pathways (aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), androgen receptor (AR), androgen receptor ligand-binding domain (AR-LBD), aromatase, estrogen receptor alpha (ER), estrogen receptor ligand-binding domain (ER-LBD) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR-Gamma)) and stress response pathways (nuclear factor (erythroid-derived 2)-like 2/antioxidant responsive element (nrf2/ARE), heat shock factor response element (HSE), mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP), phosphoprotein (tumour suppressor) p53 and ATPase family AAA domain-containing protein 5 (ATAD5)) [39] and details are given in Tables S5 and S6.",

The study shows that all the compounds except 2i and 2j can have an active tendency to bind with hERG K+ channel [40] which results cardiac toxicity (Table S5). Compounds 2a and 2g are almost non-toxic and passed all the above-mentioned toxicity parameters (Table S6). A weak activity against carcinogenicity, immunotoxicity and AhR was predicted for 2a and only AhR activity for 2g. It was also predicted that all other compounds including 2j (cardiac non-toxic) are strongly active only in immunotoxicity. It is also interesting to note that such prediction on the five FDA-approved antiviral drugs (rilpivirine, dolutegravir, glecaprevir, grazoprevir and paritaprevir) also have the same strong immunotoxicity activity (Table S7). Therefore, immunotoxicity may be allowed in some cases. Considering all these factors, it can be concluded that 2j is found to be the best in this case.",
