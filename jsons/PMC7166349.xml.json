However, it has also been found in children with mild infections [Martin et al., 2015] and in asymptomatic ones [Garc\u00eda\u2010Garc\u00eda et al., 2008]. Up to 75% of the HBoV infections are coinfections with one or more viruses [Calvo et al., 2007]. A prolonged viral shedding has been described, about 75 days in outpatients [Martin et al., 2010], and up to 4.5 months in hospitalized children [Blessing et al., 2009], which probably explains HBoV detection in asymptomatic cases [von Linstow et al., 2008]. Although the pathogenic role of HBoV has been questioned, serologic diagnosis of HBoV has recently confirmed significant increases in IgG antibodies in children with pneumonia. These results support the idea that it is a true pathogen in respiratory tract infections in children [Korppi et al., 2010]. Unfortunately, this technique is not yet available in many laboratories and requires an invasive procedure for diagnosis.",

The single infections were characterized by the presence of high fever, wheezing, a significant percentage of pneumonia, hypoxia, moderate leukocytosis and elevated CRP, all of which lead to frequent antibiotic treatment. Children were on average 2\u2010year old and infections occurred mainly in November and December. Although HBoV seasonally coincides with RSV, clinical characteristics of both viruses are quite different. RSV affects younger children, causing bronchiolitis and it is less frequently associated with radiographic infiltrates, it does not induce leukocytosis, and CRP is normal. hMPV circulate in spring, and clinical features are similar to those of RSV and different to HBoV infections. Rhinovirus circulates throughout the year, children have a similar age to the HBoV group, have also wheezing and infiltrates, but fever is less frequent.

A potential explanation for the differential clinical characteristics found in our patients might lie in the greater severity of hospitalized patients versus ambulatory ones. Furthermore, the number of patients analyzed by Martin could make it difficult to find distinguishing characteristics. Our series included a large number of patients and this allows us to draw conclusions on clinical data for a homogeneous population. Although there are very few studies comparing the clinical characteristics of HBoV infections with other viruses, some authors such as Moriyama et al.

We have not found specific comparisons between HBoV and RV or hMPV, with the exception of previous work by our group [Calvo et al., 2007] and the study of Zhang in China with a small group of different viruses [Zhang et al., 2013].

Coinfections are as frequent as 75\u201380% also in previous studies [Calvo et al., 2007; Fry et al., 2007; Martin et al., 2010; Broccolo et al., 2015], and this might suggest that the symptoms may be caused by other viruses. In addition, HBoV is able to persist and therefore could be more often detected as an accompanying pathogen. Several authors have demonstrated that HBoV persist in different cells [L\u00fcsebrink et al., 2011], intestinal tissues [Kapoor et al., 2011], lung and tumors [Schildgen et al., 2013], and in tonsillar tissue in children [Falcone et al., 2011]. Moreover, Byington et al. [2015] detected persistent HBoV in children, with and without symptoms, lasting longer than with other viruses. Therefore, the positivity of HBoV does not imply causality [Storch, 2015]. Furthermore, it is worth mentioning that Huang et al. [2012] and Dijkman et al. [2009] have shown that HBoV induces a cytopathic effect in human airway epithelial cell cultures, and it is very unlikely that a harmless bystander would be able to produce a cytopathic effect.",

More recently, in an outpatient population Martin et al. [2015], found that children infected with HBoV were more likely to experience recurrent cough episodes and to visit a healthcare provider during the 14 days following the time of initial detection of HBoV. Sequences of the samples from 12 of the 48 children that were positive for HBoV\u20101 were not 100% identical; and therefore, were considered to be HBoV reinfections that contributed to long\u2010term shedding.

This might also explain conflicting results in different studies [Martin et al., 2010; Ghietto et al., 2015; Principi et al., 2015]. Although not specifically included in this study, we ourselves have failed to find differences in viral load between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients.

It also has some limitations, since we do not have a control group. However, we have confirmed in a previous work of our group, that symptomatic children in our setting have significantly higher HBoV positivity than healthy children [Garc\u00eda\u2010Garc\u00eda et al., 2008]. We do not have serial samples collected to assess the shedding of HBoV. This prevents us from knowing if recurrent cases had a negative sample between episodes. We do not have serology and therefore, we cannot confirm that infections are acute and that HBoV is the causal agent. Serology has demonstrated that HBoV has a pathogenic role in respiratory infections [Kantola et al., 2008; S\u00f6derlund\u2010Venermo et al., 2009; Don et al., 2010], but it has only been available in the last few years and only in some laboratories. It is remarkable, that in the study by Don et al. [2010], serology confirms the pathogenic role of HBoV in children with pneumonia, which is one of the most frequent diagnoses found in our series. Other studies [Ghietto et al., 2015], match our series and find no clinical differences between single infections and coinfections with HBoV, which may also suggest the role of this virus in multiple infections.",
