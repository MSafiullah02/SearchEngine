Additionally, 58% of HCW in 207 our study had symptoms of depression, which is higher than those of oncologists 208 (12%) (Paiva et al., 2018). 209 These data suggests an urgent need for psychological intervention for HCW, as 210 mental health is crucial not only for their own well-being, but also for their work 211 efficacy, which contributes to the quality of medical services and patient safety, and 212 may, in turn, affect psychological health of HCW (Ruotsalainen et al., 2014).",

More importantly,218   protective measures were the independent risk factor for the development of anxiety219    and depression, which is in line with one study about SARS, in which it was found 220 the sufficient protection was a positive factor for mental health of HCW(Kaysen et   221   al., 2003). However, the sudden occurrence of the COVID-19 outbreak, which was222 both fast and widespread, the particular timing (coinciding with the Spring Festival) 223 and traffic control-led to a shortage of masks, goggles, face shields and protective 224 clothing. Under such conditions, some HCW used masks repeatedly and did not drink 225 water or go to the bathroom to prolong the life of their protective equipment, which 226 might reduce its effectiveness and increase the risk of infection. We suggest that these 227 physical and psychological responses induced symptoms of anxiety and depression. 228 Contact history was another important independent risk factor for both anxiety 229 and depression. However, the conclusion that contact history affects psychological 230 health is controversial. Authors of one study about SARS announced that contact with 231 an infected patient was not an adverse factor for psychological health (Maunder et al., 232 2006). In contrast, authors of another study indicated that HCW who had more 233 possible exposure to SARS were 2-3 times more likely to have high PTS levels than 234 those without exposure (Kaysen et al., 2003; Wu et al., 2009). In our study, when 235 compared to those who had had no contact, HCW who had contact with diagnosed 236 patients were approximately twice as likely to develop anxiety and depression. This is 237 because contact with infected and suspected patients will induce fear and uncertainty 238 for the virus, as there is no effective medication for treating COVID-19 pneumonia, 239 and the prognosis is inclusive. Additionally, the incubation time of COVID-19 240 pneumonia is longer than SARS, meaning the sustained and cumulative stress over 241 time turns into anxiety.242",

The senior and junior titles were 248 found to have significant differences in stress (Supplementary Figure 2), which could 249 be explained by the observation that juniors have more contact with infected patients 250 and specimens than senior HCW (Supplementary Figure 3). Interestingly, HCW with 251 all three types of title have endured stress (median PSS=28, 28, 26 respectively), but 252 only intermediate titles were an independent risk factor for anxiety (",

Epidemiological studies have documented during disease epidemics, HCW at 170 the forefront of the fight against illness are prone to stress responses (Mata et al., 2015). Such responses lead to changes in perception and development of 172 psychological morbidity such as anxiety, depression, PTS, and PTSD (Kaysen et al., 2003). Studies pointed out that SARS and the Middle East respiratory syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) caused high rates of psychological morbidity for HCW in 175 hospitals. Even one to three years after SARS, fear, chronic stress and depression 176 remained for HCW(Nickell et al., 2004).
