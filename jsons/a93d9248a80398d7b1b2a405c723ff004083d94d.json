Published data on this topic do not provide a clear answer concerning the utility of steroids in this clinical setting. a study published in 2002 showed that adjunctive dexamethasone use in patients with pneumococcal meningitis improved outcomes by reducing both complications and mortality. 6 as such, current recommendations include the use of steroids as a treatment modality. dexamethasone should be used empirically when there is suspicion for or a possibility of S. pneumoniae infection, and continued if confirmed with results from csf grams stain or blood cultures. \u2020 the beneficial effect of steroids is seen only when administered prior to or with the first dose of antibiotics. on the other hand, a 2007 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in sub-saharan africa did not support the routine adjunctive use of corticosteroids in the management of patients with suspected aBm. 7 in this area, pneumococcus is the primary pathogen, and an overwhelming proportion of patients included in the trial were hiV-positive. 7 the causal relationship for these findings is unclear, but could potentially have implications for hiV-positive patients in developed countries as well.

Bacteria invade the lower respiratory tract via aspiration, inhalation of contaminated aerosols, or hematogenous spread. overt or covert aspiration (at times referred to as microaspiration) of oropharyngeal or gastric flora is thought to be the most common route of organism delivery to the lower respiratory tract. in critically ill patients, the oropharynx becomes colonized with gram-negative organisms a few days after admission to the hospital, especially if the patients have been exposed to antimicrobial therapy. once an inoculum of pathogenic organisms reaches the lower respiratory tract, medical disease processes that reduce host immunity and violation of the host anatomic barriers make the ideal milieu for pneumonia to flourish. 13 since aspiration is a common route of pathogen entry into the lower respiratory tract and since critically ill patients have an altered oropharyngeal and gastrointestinal flora, one can understand the differences in responsible pathogens between nosocomial pneumonia and caP. nosocomial pneumonia may be caused by a wide variety of bacterial pathogens but has been most commonly associated with enteric gram-negative bacilli (see table 32-9).

Broad-spectrum empiric antimicrobial therapy should eventually be tailored to each individual patient based on clinical and microbiologic data. the optimal duration of therapy is not known; however, it has been shown that in patients with VaP, appropriate antimicrobial treatment for 8 days is as clinically effective as treatment for 15 days. in addition, shorter duration of treatment may reduce a patient's future risk for infection with increasingly resistant pathogens. 15 unfortunately, even with the correct choice of antibiotics, overall mortality from nosocomial pneumonia remains substantial (25-50%) 13 ; hence, prevention of such infection will have the greatest impact on the outcome of hospitalized patients. effective strategies for reducing the incidence of nosocomial pneumonia include strict infection control policies, reduction of the duration of mechanical ventilation, appropriate positioning of hospitalized patients, and limitation/early removal of invasive devices. utilization of contact precautions for selected transmittable organisms (mRsa, group a streptococci, N. meningitidis, penicillin-resistant S. pneumoniae, multiresistant gram-negative bacilli, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, and respiratory viruses) is the most important maneuver shown to be effective in reducing incidence of nosocomial pneumonia.",

            "text": "1. the answer is c. acute bacterial meningitis (aBm) is a fulminant fatal process, especially if recognition of the disease and institution of therapy are delayed. often, there is concern about potential brain herniation if a lumbar puncture is performed in patients who have mental status changes and unsuspected brain masses; therefore, most clinicians obtain a ct scan before doing the lumbar puncture. however, ct scan of the brain is never considered a valid reason to delay antimicrobial treatment in patients suspected to have aBm. lumbar puncture with fluid analysis is necessary in this scenario, but treatment with appropriate antibiotics should be instituted as soon as the diagnosis is suspected and after obtaining blood cultures. it may be true that this patient needs icu care, but that should not delay the work up and treatment of aBm. 2. the answer is c. this patient has developed a ventilator-associated pneumonia that has led to clinical deterioration in the setting of antibiotic therapy for a urinary tract infection. although the patient may have an inadequately treated urinary tract infection, he has worsening respiratory status and a chest radiographic finding suggesting a nosocomial ventilator-acquired pneumonia. the patient's new infection is likely due to a resistant organism; therefore, to continue his daily antibiotic regimen with cefotaxime while waiting for culture and sensitivity is inappropriate. although some clinicians advocate the use of fiberoptic bronchoscopy to obtain quantitative bronchoalveolar lavage on protected specimen brush cultures, it is an accepted practice to obtain sputum and blood cultures while waiting for culture and sensitivity results and change to antimicrobial treatment to include treatment for mRsa and Pseudomonas. 3. the answer is B. the patient developed signs of sepsis and deteriorated, despite improvement of his pneumonia. his sepsis work-up should include C. difficile toxin assay because of the diarrhea. other sources of infection may be his urinary tract, central indwelling catheter, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, or meningitis. endocarditis should be suspected if he has a new cardiac murmur or persistent bacteremia. the change in mental status in this patient is likely related to sepsis, and although ct scan of the brain and lumbar puncture may be required, other antibiotics should be added to clindamycin to treat his new sepsis. indiscriminate use of antidiarrheals without first ruling out infection in a patient with fevers may lead to severe complications, including toxic megacolon. intravenous fluids with potassium supplementation would be appropriate in this patient with profuse diarrhea. flexible sigmoidoscopy may be helpful in diagnosing pseudomembranous colitis. in this patient with aspiration pneumonia, empiric metronidazole and stool analysis for C. difficile toxin are most appropriate. 4. the answer is B. at this early stage of presentation, the source of this patient's sepsis syndrome is unclear although catheter-related infection is likely. as such, a complete diagnostic work-up is warranted to search for the source of infection. given her hemodynamic instability, broad-spectrum coverage should be initiated. given her tPn dependence, she is at risk for associated fungemia and use of antifungals should be considered. fluconazole alone would not be adequate as she should receive empiric coverage for bacterial pathogens. while she may require icu admission and vasopressor agents, and possibly even Picc line removal, but most important should be empiric treatment for her sepsis syndrome and diagnostic work-up. 5. the answer is d. this man is presenting with pneumonia. his illness is severe enough to have led to respiratory failure. the presence of gingival disease and alcohol use raise the question of possible aspiration and, with it, possible anaerobic infection. given this patient's recent hospitalization, he is at risk for infection with hospitalacquired pathogens. clindamycin alone, while covering possible anaerobic infection, would not treat for a nosocomial infection. Vancomycin and piperacillin-tazobactam will cover anaerobes as well as common potential causative organisms of nosocomial pneumonia (including mRsa and Pseudomonas) and is the indicated treatment in this clinically unstable patient. attempts should then be made to make a microbiologic diagnosis with blood and sputum cultures to tailor therapy.",
