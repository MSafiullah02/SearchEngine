After DNase treatment, cDNA was prepared with and without reverse transcriptase. RT-PCR reactions were performed using primer sets that detect both the endogenously and exogenously expressed mRNAs. A GAPDH primer set was used as a control for equal RNA in the each set of samples and is shown for the IQGAP1transfected samples.

Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were treated with cycloheximide at a concentration of 40 g/ml. Extracts were then prepared immediately, or 3, 6 hours, or 18 hours later.
