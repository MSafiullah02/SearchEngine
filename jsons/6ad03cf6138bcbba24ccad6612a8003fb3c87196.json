University Hospital Institute-M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e Infection 30 performs real-time surveillance of all diagnoses of infections and associated deaths in public 31 hospitals of Marseille, Southeastern France. Here, mortality associated with diagnoses of 32 respiratory viruses was compared during colder months of 2018-2019 and 2019-2020 (week 33 47-week 14). In 2018-2019, 73 patients (0.17% of 42,851 hospitalized patients) died after 34 being diagnosed with a respiratory virus; 40 and 13 deaths occurred in patients diagnosed 35 with influenza A virus and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), respectively. In 2019-2020, 50 36 patients (0.10% of 49,043 patients hospitalized) died after being diagnosed with a common 37 respiratory virus; 7 and 7 deaths occurred in patients diagnosed with influenza A virus and 38 RSV, respectively. Additionally, 55 patients died after being diagnosed with SARS-CoV-2. 39 The proportion of respiratory virus-associated deaths among hospitalized patients was thus 40 significantly lower for common respiratory viruses in 2019-2020 than in 2018-2019 (102 41 versus 170 per 100,000 hospitalized patients; p= 0.003), majoritarily as a consequence of a 42 decrease in influenza A virus (-83%) and RSV (-46%)-associated deaths. Overall, the 43 proportion of respiratory virus-associated deaths among hospitalized patients was higher but 44 not significantly in 2019-2020 than in 2018-2019 (214 versus 170 per 100,000 hospitalized 45 patients; p= 0.08, Yates-corrected chi-square test). These findings allow putting into 46 perspective the death burden of SARS-CoV-2 infections in our geographical area. are a major cause of mortality worldwide with an estimated 2.7 million 53 deaths in 2015 (GBD 2015 LRI Collaborators, 2017). In France, they are causing several 54 thousands of deaths every year during colder months (Pivette et al., 2020). Since January 55 2020, the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak has generated much fear and countermeasures to stem the 56 spread of this respiratory virus. This has been largely fueled by the tremendously extensive 57 reporting of Covid-19-associated deaths. As of March 31, 2020, 770,520 people have been 58 found infected worldwide of whom 36,942 (4.8%) died, five countries (Italy, Spain, China, 59 USA and France) being concerned by 77% of these deaths 60 (https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html). France identified 3,024 deaths for 44,450 infections 61 (6.8%). The University Hospital Institute M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e Infection performs with in-house tools 62 a real-time surveillance of all infections in public hospitals of Marseille, Southeastern France 63 (Abat et al., 2015; Roussel et al., 2020). This surveillance allows analyzing each week the 64 number of each type of clinical sample received and any pathogen diagnosed at our 65 laboratory, including respiratory samples and viruses, and to perform retrospective analyses 66 that include the most recent available data. It also includes the count of the deaths associated 67 with any diagnosed infection. Here, we compared the mortality associated with diagnoses of 68 respiratory viruses during colder months overlapping 2018-2019 and 2019-2020. 69 Testing of respiratory samples was performed using FTD Respiratory pathogens 21 70 (Fast Track Diagnosis, Luxembourg) or Biofire FilmArray Respiratory panel 2 plus 71 (Biom\u00e9rieux, France) assays. Between week 47 of 2018 and week 14 of 2019, 73 patients 72 died after being diagnosed with a respiratory virus (Table 1). They represented 0.17% of the occurred in 40 of the patients diagnosed with influenza A virus (1.7%), which was the 75 respiratory virus associated with the highest number of deaths. In addition, deaths occurred in 76 19 of the patients diagnosed with rhinoviruses (1.5%), and in 13 of those diagnosed with 77 respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) (1.1%). Respiratory samples had not been tested for 78 coronaviruses and parainfluenza viruses in routine clinical practice, but all those tested 79 retrospectively from patients who died at hospital were negative. In comparison, during the 80 same period of winter 2019-2020 (between week 47 of 2019 and week 14 of 2020), 50 81 patients died after being diagnosed with a common respiratory virus. They represented 0.10% 82 of the 49,043 patients hospitalized during this period and 4.5% of the 1,115 who died. They 83 included 7 of the patients diagnosed with influenza A virus (0.5%), 3 of those diagnosed with 84 influenza B virus (0.2%), 7 of those diagnosed with RSV (0.7%), and 6, 2 and 1 of those 85 diagnosed with human coronavirus-HKU1 (2.4%), NL63 (1.2%) and OC43 (0.8%), 86 respectively",

Of these infected patients, 55 (1.5%) died; their median age was 82 89 years. 90 Thus, a total of 105 patients died after being diagnosed with a respiratory virus during 91 colder months of 2019-2020 until week 14 of 2020 compared to 73 the year before during the 92 same timeframe (+44%). However, the proportion of respiratory virus-associated deaths 93 among hospitalized patients did not differ significantly in 2019-2020 and in 2018-2019 (214 94 versus 170 per 100,000 hospitalized patients; p= 0.08, Yates-corrected chi-square test). In 95 contrast, it was significantly lower in 2019-2020 than in 2018-2019 for common respiratory 96 viruses (102 versus 170 per 100,000 hospitalized patients; p= 0.003), which were associated 97 with 33% less deaths in 2019-2020. This drop was essentially due to a significant decrease of 98 influenza A virus-associated deaths (-84%; p<10 -3 ) and a decrease of RSV (-46%; p=0.18)-associated deaths among patients diagnosed with these viruses. The drop of influenza-100 associated deaths could be in part explained by the predominance of Areported to be associated with a greater mortality in elderly people (Lemaitre et 103 al., 2012; Paget et al., 2019). We also observed in 2019-2020 compared to 2018-2019 a 21% 104 drop in the number of deaths in patients diagnosed with a rhinovirus, and a reduction from 105 1.5% to 1% of the proportion of deaths among diagnosed patients (p=0.11). 106 Overall, these findings allow putting into perspective the death burden of SARS-CoV-107 2 infections in our geographical area. Thus, the number of SARS-CoV-2-associated deaths 108 was similar to that of deaths associated with other viral respiratory infections between 109 December 2019 and March 2020, and lower than that of deaths associated with viral 110 respiratory infections between December 2018 and March 2019. In addition, we did not 111 observe a significant impact of SARS-CoV-2 infections on the overall number of deaths (of 112 any cause) among hospitalized people in Marseille public hospitals (1,115 deaths in 2019-113 2020 during the study period versus 1,137 in 2018-2019; Figure 1a), or in the population of 114 metropolitan France (175,384 deaths in 2019-2020 versus 173,923 in 2018-2019; Figure 1b; 115 https://www.insee.fr/fr/statistiques/serie/000436394#Telechargement). Further analyses might 116 determine if this is related to containment or other changes related to the SARS-CoV-2 117 epidemics. The number of SARS-CoV-2-associated deaths will grow after the timeframe of 118 the present study as a consequence of recent or new infections but the peak of incidence of 119 SARS-CoV-2 infections was reached at the end of March 2020 in Marseille public hospitals 120 (https://www.mediterranee-infection.com/covid-19/) and in metropolitan France",
