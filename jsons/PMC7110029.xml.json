Controlling BRD among newly received cattle is the greatest challenge facing the stocker and feedlot segments of beef cattle production (Edwards, 2010). Preconditioning is a management practice to prepare immature calves for stocker or feedlot entry by reducing stress and enhancing disease protection through pre-arrival vaccination (Cole, 1985; Duff and Galyean, 2007). Preconditioned calves have improved health and performance compared with high-risk calves originating from auction markets (Clark et al., 2006; Seeger et al., 2008). However, the adoption rate of management factors including weaning (50.2%) or respiratory vaccination (39.4%) in U.S. beef cow-calf operations remains low (USDA, 2010).",

Calves born persistently infected (PI) with BVDV are a primary source of BVDV transmission (Fulton et al., 2005). Although prevalence of PI-BVDV animals in the feedlot is estimated to be relatively low (0.3%; Loneragan et al., 2005), a single PI-BVDV animal has the potential to continuously expose cohorts in an entire pen and adjacent pens to the virus. Because research observations are conflicting, the decision to invest in PI-BVDV control programs for newly received cattle remains controversial. One inconsistency among the literature is the use of experimental animals with varied management and health history. It is hypothesized that health and performance are altered by exposure to a PI-BVDV pen mate in high-risk, commingled cohorts; however, the effects of PI-BVDV exposure are less extensive in single-source, preconditioned calves. Our objective was to evaluate effects of PI-BVDV exposure and determine if health and performance outcomes differ for these divergent management systems.",

Subsequently, 5 individual sample aliquots were selected randomly from each treatment pen from d 0 and 28 and shipped on ice via overnight parcel service to the Iowa State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory (ISUVDL, Ames, IA) for determination of serum neutralizing antibody titer concentration and seroconversion against BVDV type 1a (Singer strain) using the virus neutralization (VN) assay. The second set of serum aliquot samples were pooled within day (d 0 and 28 only) and treatment pen and shipped on ice via overnight parcel service to the Texas Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory \u2013 Amarillo (TVMDL, Amarillo, TX) for determination of serum neutralizing antibody titer concentrations against BVDV type 1a (NADL strain), 1b (TGAC strain), and 2a (125 strain) using the VN assay.

Upon arrival to the RU, each PI-BVDV animal was ear-notched a second time, and samples were shipped via overnight parcel service to a different laboratory [Oklahoma Animal Disease Diagnostic Lab, Stillwater, OK or USDA, ARS, National Animal Disease Center (NADC), Ames, IA] for rapid affirmation of positive PI-BVDV status using the same ACE procedure. Group 1 (n = 10) was assembled before trial initiation and used for shipment block 1 and 2, whereas group 2 (n = 9) was assembled before beginning block 3 and used for block 3 and 4 of the trial. Depending on block, 4 to 8 PI-BVDV challenge calves were assigned randomly to 1 of 4 or 1 of 8 PI-designated pens by drawing pen assignment number. An appropriate number of PI-BVDV calves were assembled for each group to allow for available alternates if an originally designated PI-BVDV animal died. Each PI-BVDV calf that died during the trial (Group 1, n = 2; Group 2, n = 1) was replaced immediately with a confirmed PI-positive alternate. Additionally, anticoagulated blood was collected from each PI-BVDV challenge animal and shipped on ice via overnight parcel service to NADC for subsequent differentiation of BVDV subgenotype strain using a method of virus isolation of buffy coat cells and phylogenetic analysis previously described by Ridpath et al. (2011). The subgenotype strain of the 2 PI-positive alternates from Group 1 was not determined and therefore unknown. Of the PI-BVDV calves acquired for use as exposure sources in the current study and subgenotype confirmed, 94.7% (18 of 19) were identified as subgenotype 1b. One PI-BVDV animal from Group 2 was identified as subgenotype 1a, and the pen in which this animal was assigned was removed from all statistical analyses. It is important to note that BVDV type 1b, the subgenotype strain in which the PI-BVDV calves used in this experiment were identified, is the predominant BVDV subgenotype strain isolated from cattle in the US (Fulton et al., 2002; Ridpath et al., 2010); however, the pentavalent MLV respiratory vaccine used in this study contained only BVDV type 1a and 2a strains because currently no commercially licensed MLV respiratory vaccine in the US contains a BVDV 1b isolate.",

The spatial pen arrangement used in the current study may have contributed to confounding effects of location within the RU facility; however, we determined the potential confounding effects of fence-line and water source contact between PI and CON to be more significant. Pens measured 30.5 \u00d7 152 m, contained 5 m of feed bunk-line, and a fence-line water source shared with an adjacent pen of the same treatment. Furthermore, the treatment pens were configured so that unlike treatment pens were separated by either a 3-m drovers or 5-m feed alley. Within management group (AM or PC), calves were stratified by gender (AM only) and d \u22121 BW, then assigned randomly to 1 of 2 or 1 of 4 PI or CON pens depending on block (8 to 11 calves/pen) resulting in total experimental unit (pen) replication of 14, 14, 12, and 11 for AMCON, AMPI, PCCON, and PCPI, respectively. For PI treatments, a PI-BVDV type 1b challenge animal was assigned randomly to each PI-designated treatment pen such that pens within block had an equivalent number of cattle. During all weighing and BRD evaluation procedures, CON treatments were evaluated first, followed by PI treatments, to avoid unwanted CON contact with PI challenge animals or experimental cattle in the PI treatments and to reduce potential exposure to fomites contaminated with body fluids or fecal material containing BVDV. Because of spatial treatment arrangement and the necessity to evaluate CON followed by PI, morbidity investigators were not blinded to experimental treatment.",

Main effects of management were frequently observed for growth performance; PC steers had greater (P < 0.001) ADG compared with AM calves from d 0 to 14 (1.65 vs. 0.66 kg/d), d 0 to 28 (1.28 vs. 0.77 kg/d), and d 0 to 42 (1.20 vs. 0.85 kg/d). This indicates that weaning management intended to improve disease resistance and mitigate physiological stress of beef calves results in greater BW gain performance during the stocker receiving period; however, commingling and additional stressors resulting from the marketing process experienced by AM, but not PC, should be considered. Our observation of improved performance for preconditioned calves is in agreement with other reports in the literature. Step et al. (2008) compared health and performance of beef calves from a single-source ranch using a preconditioning management strategy (Ranch), to calves procured and assembled through multiple auction markets (Market), or a commingled group (COMM) containing a portion of Ranch and Market origin cattle. In that study, regardless of weaning or vaccination status, calves originating from Ranch tended to have greater ADG than COMM or Market calves for the 42-d receiving period. In a trial conducted by Clark et al. (2006), low-risk preconditioned calves had greater ADG during the finishing period than high-risk auction market calves of unknown history; however, no differences in performance were observed during the 28-d receiving period. Seeger et al. (2008) observed that auction market steers of unknown origin or health history gained 0.18 kg/d less during a finishing period than weaned beef calves receiving a health protocol on their origin ranch before marketing. Pritchard and Mendez (1990) suggested that non-preconditioned calves may fully compensate for initial performance loss by the end of the feeding period; however, the non-preconditioned cattle used in that experiment were maintained as a single-source and were not subjected to stressors associated with the auction market system.",

The performance loss observed from d 28 to 42 agrees with the findings of Hessman et al. (2009), in which cattle directly exposed to a PI-BVDV animal gained 0.15 kg/d less BW than non-exposed cattle during a 66 d feedlot starter period. Elam et al. (2008) observed a tendency for PI-BVDV-exposed cattle to gain less BW from d 0 to 28, but overall ADG was not affected by PI-BVDV exposure in that study. Performance from d 0 to 28 was not affected (P = 0.10) by PI-BVDV exposure in our trial; nevertheless, during the initial weeks of our study, PI-BVDV animals may have unintentionally served as a trainer animal because they had been previously acclimated to the RU. In a series of 4 trials, Loerch and Fluharty (2000) observed increases in eating behavior and variable ADG for newly received calves with a trainer cow present in the pen during the initial 14 d, but overall (28-d) differences in growth were undetectable in 3 of 4 trials. Another consideration is that short-term exposure to a low-virulent BVDV strain from a PI pen mate could imitate an unattenuated autogenous vaccination resulting in undetectable or small performance differences during the initial weeks of PI-BVDV exposure. However, as PI-BVDV exposure continued, a progressive effect on host immune activity or inflammation may have resulted in the performance loss observed from d 28 to 42 because repeated immune stimulation results in nutrients being preferentially used for immune and homeostatic pathways rather than tissue deposition (Klasing and Korver, 1997; Spurlock, 1997). Furthermore, the catabolic effects of proinflammatory cytokine stimulation from continuous PI-BVDV exposure may have inhibited growth (Johnson, 1997) from d 28 to 42 in our study. Therefore, performance consequences in newly received cohorts exposed to a PI-BVDV pen mate may be delayed several weeks because immunomodulation resulting from PI-BVDV exposure and these potential effects on growth is progressive. Alternatively, the immunomodulatory effects of PI-BVDV exposure may have a more indirect effect on growth via increased susceptibility of cohorts to complicated infections with other viruses or bacteria involved in BRD, thereby, decreasing health and performance (Gardner et al., 1999). Nevertheless, our ADG results suggest there may be a significant metabolic cost associated with continuous exposure to a PI animal shedding a low-virulence BVDV strain. The performance loss may not be immediate but rather several weeks subsequent when nutrients used for humoral and cell-mediated immunity or when catabolic effects of proinflammatory cytokine stimulation associated with repeated BVDV exposure presumably reach a threshold effect on growth performance. Because BW measurements were not recorded beyond the 42-d receiving period, the duration of performance loss and whether there was compensatory gain during the finishing phase is unknown and warrants further investigation. Published research evaluating PI-BVDV exposure effects on performance is both limited and conflicting; therefore, additional studies with careful consideration of management and health history of experimental cattle, differences in the virulence and subgenotype strain of PI-BVDV challenge animals, and epidemiological factors are required to determine effects of PI-BVDV exposure on performance throughout the various stages of the beef production system. Furthermore, a better understanding of metabolic responses to physiological alteration and immunomodulation from PI-BVDV exposure is needed.",

Other studies (Macartney et al., 2003; Seeger et al., 2008) reported that calves of unknown health history had greater morbidity compared with those administered health protocols before marketing. Similarly, Roeber et al. (2001) observed that cattle originating from a preconditioning program had fewer hospital visits than cattle originating from auction markets. Step et al.

Although a treatment interaction was not significant (P = 0.15) for the number of cattle treated thrice, the numerical difference was more pronounced within AM calves. The AMPI had 9.5% more calves treated thrice than AMCON, whereas PCPI had only 1.7% more calves treated thrice than PCCON. A treatment interaction (P = 0.06) was observed for the percentage of chronically ill animals; AMPI had the greatest number of chronically ill calves (7.6%), AMCON was intermediate (1.1%), and PCCON and PCPI were least (0.4 and 0.3%, respectively). This observation suggests that weaning management and exposure to a PI-BVDV pen mate affect health additively because percentage of chronically ill was greatest for AMPI, with no difference among PCCON and PCPI. A numerical, but not statistical difference (P = 0.10), was observed for PI-BVDV-exposed cohorts having an increased antibiotic treatment cost which averaged $12.59 and $10.40/animal for PI and CON, respectively. Within AM cohorts, AMPI had an antibiotic treatment cost of $4.06/animal more than AMCON; this numerical increase was similar to the estimated PI-BVDV testing cost ($4.25/sample including next day parcel service fees). Our observations among AMPI and AMCON agree with another study using high-risk calves of unknown history (Hessman et al., 2009) in that overall morbidity was not different for direct PI-exposed or unexposed groups; however, percentage of first relapse, chronic illness, and fatalities were greater for the direct PI-exposed groups. In that trial, treatment cost/animal was not statistically different (P = 0.24), but a numerical increase of $1.19/animal was observed for direct PI-exposed groups. Loneragan et al. (2005) determined that cattle exposed to a PI-BVDV animal had a 43% greater risk of initial BRD treatment and clinically ill cattle with a PI-BVDV animal in the pen were administered more antibiotic treatments than non-exposed pens (1.76 vs. 1.46). Conversely, Booker et al. (2008) observed no differences in BRD health among PI- and non-PI-exposed pens, whereas O'Conner et al. (2005) observed that disease prevalence was reduced in pens containing low-risk, single-source cattle with a PI-BVDV calf present. Elam et al. (2008) used low-risk, preconditioned heifers that also received antibiotic metaphylaxis on-arrival and reported no difference in health with either short- (60 h) or long-term (duration of study) exposure to a PI-BVDV pen mate. Their observation of no health differences for PI-exposed cohorts using low-risk, preconditioned heifers would agree with our observation of few health differences between PCCON and PCPI treatments. In a feedlot study using auction-derived cattle (Stevens et al., 2007), morbidity was increased for pens with short-term (13 to 18 d) exposure to PI-BVDV. Conversely, a subsequent study conducted in the same feedlot facility (Stevens et al., 2009) in which the PI animal was removed more rapidly (\u2264d 2) and overall morbidity and mortality were considerably less, initial BRD treatment was reduced for PI-exposed pens.",

Our observation of chronically ill cattle being most prevalent for AMPI, with less pronounced animal health differences observed among PCPI and PCCON treatments, suggests that previous management and vaccination against BVDV and other respiratory pathogens may afford some degree of cohort tolerance to a PI-BVDV pen mate. The extent that PI-BVDV exposure affected economically important traits related to BRD morbidity in the current model was affected by previous management and health history in newly received calves, suggesting that the 2 factors are additive. Therefore, the decision to invest in a PI-BVDV control program for stocker or feedlot production systems should be based partly upon the perceived BRD risk level of each group of newly received calves.",

The difference in antibody titers against BVDV type 1a on d 0 suggests that AM calves were relatively na\u00efve, and PC calves had greater humoral immune protection against BVDV challenge. Furthermore, greater serum antibody titers against BVDV type 1a on d 0 negatively correlated (P < 0.001; correlation coefficient = 0.52) with subsequent clinical BRD morbidity in our trial. Previous serological data (Martin et al., 1999; O'Connor et al., 2001) also indicate that greater serum antibody titers against BVDV upon arrival at the feedlot correspond with a subsequent reduction in risk for clinical BRD. Bolin and Ridpath (1995) observed that calves with greater titer levels of passively acquired viral neutralizing antibody in serum had reduced duration and severity of clinical disease after intranasal BVDV challenge. In another trial (Fulton et al., 2006), vaccination with 2 doses of MLV respiratory vaccine containing both BVDV type 1a and 2a isolates provided protection against viremia in calves exposed to PI-BVDV type 2a challenge animals during a 35-d observation period. However, it has also been suggested that decreased serum concentrations of pre-existing antibodies, particularly those heterologous to the subgenotype strain shed by PI challenge animals, may not be sufficient to provide complete protection (Fulton et al., 2005).",

It should be considered that AM received identical vaccinations and processing procedures as PC, only the timing of administration differed, suggesting that MLV respiratory vaccination before market-associated stress and pathogen exposure is critical to achieve sufficient antibody titer concentrations before the initial 14 d of receiving when BRD is most frequent. Furthermore, our observations lend evidence that on-arrival MLV respiratory vaccination in recently vaccinated PC calves may be redundant because the PC steers in our study were not revaccinated on d 0, yet 100% were seropositive for BVDV type 1a on d 0 and BRD morbidity for PC calves during the 42-d receiving period was low (7.2 %).",

After 28-d continuous exposure to a PI-BVDV type 1b pen mate, a main effect of exposure was not observed for BVDV type 1a (P = 0.88), 1b (P = 0.11), or 2a (P = 0.96) titer concentrations. However, a treatment \u00d7 day interaction was observed (P < 0.001) for each of the 3 BVDV subgenotype titers analyzed. On d 28, log titer concentrations for BVDV type 1a, 1b, and 2a were increased 1.4, 2.1, and 1.7 logs, respectively, for PCPI vs. PCCON. Therefore, continuous exposure to a PI-BVDV pen mate stimulated the humoral immune response in PC cohorts, and the magnitude of increase was greatest for the homologous BVDV strain (type 1b). Burciaga-Robles et al. (2010) observed increased antibody titers to BVDV type 1b (TGAC strain) but not type 1a (Singer strain) or 2a (125 strain) when steers were exposed to 2 PI-BVDV type 1b challenge animals for 72 h. In a study comparing virus neutralization results between BVDV strains belonging to different subgenotypes, Ridpath et al. (2010) reported that the ratio of virus cross-neutralization among BVDV type 1a and 1b is 36%. Similar increases in titer concentrations after 28-d PI-exposure were not evident (P \u2265 0.05) for AMPI; however, the MLV respiratory vaccine administered on d 0 and 14 to AM calves, which contained BVDV type 1a and 2a isolates, likely confounded antibody titer response to PI-BVDV type 1b exposure. Nevertheless, increases in serum antibody titers associated with PI-BVDV-exposed cohorts may be greater for the homogenous subgenotype strain shed by a PI-BVDV pen mate.",

Total PBL averaged 10.9 and 8.6 \u00d7 103/\u03bcL for PC and AM treatments, respectively, and total PBL concentration increased overall with time. Our observation of total PBL being greater, and BRD morbidity being least for PC, suggests total PBL concentration may correspond with stress, clinical BRD, or both; however, clarification of potential stress/disease interactions on total PBL concentration is needed. Treatment \u00d7 day interactions were observed for percentage neutrophils (P = 0.002), percentage lymphocytes (P = 0.004), lymphocyte count (P = 0.02), and neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio (P < 0.001; Figure 6). Neutrophils increased for AM but not for PC calves (management effect, P < 0.001), whereas lymphocyte count and percentage increased for PC but not AM as the study progressed (management effect, P < 0.001). This resulted in the overall neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio (N:L) being greater (P < 0.001) for AM calves; as the trial progressed, N:L increased for AM but decreased for PC (treatment \u00d7 day, P < 0.001). Other studies (Kegley et al., 1997; Ishizaki and Kariya, 2010) report transient increases in N:L for cattle experiencing transport stress; however, an additive effect from additional stressors also shown to increase N:L such as weaning (Hickey et al., 2003) and commingling (McGlone et al., 1993) may explain the extended duration of increased N:L observed for the AM calves in our study. Respiratory pathogens can also modulate total and differential PBL in cattle; challenge with BVDV, Manheimia haemolytica, or both were reported to affect several PBL concentrations (Burciaga-Robles et al., 2010).",

A tendency for an exposure effect occurred for hemoglobin (P = 0.07) and hematocrit (P = 0.09); mean values were greater for PI-exposed cohorts. A management effect (P < 0.001) was observed for platelet concentration; AM had greater platelets on d 14 and 28, which may indicate the presence of increased inflammation or a more stimulated cell-mediated immune response because platelets are an abundant source of CD154, a signaling molecule for T- and B-cell activation (Sowa et al., 2009). Our observations of greater clinical BRD for AM, and the timeframe that clinical morbidity occurred supports the association among platelet level and cell-mediated immune stimulation because the majority of clinical BRD occurred by d 14, which correlates with peak platelet concentrations observed on d 14.

Variation of the health management history of experimental animals among, or within, studies may explain conflicting health and performance results of PI-BVDV exposure in the published literature and may confound results if unaccounted. Additional research considering these issues is needed to determine if PI-BVDV testing and removal in newly received calves is economically justified for different beef production systems. Furthermore, BW gain performance was reduced from d 28 to 42 for PI-exposed cohorts suggesting a metabolic cost associated with immunomodulation from exposure to a PI-BVDV pen mate; however, the duration of performance loss and whether compensatory BW gain occurs during the finishing phase was unknown because the study ended on d 42. Our results suggest that minimal effects on health of single-source, PC steers exposed to a PI-BVDV pen mate during a 42-d receiving period do not justify the costs incurred for labor, shipping, and laboratory testing of ear-notch samples and removal of PI-positive animals. Nevertheless, high-risk, commingled, AM cattle that are na\u00efve to various BRD pathogens and experience greater clinical BRD morbidity may warrant testing and removal of PI-BVDV animals because an additive effect of management and PI-exposure was evident for percentage chronically ill. Supportive research from randomized controlled trials is needed to better understand the health, performance, and economic consequences of PI-BVDV exposure in cohorts from different weaning management systems.",
