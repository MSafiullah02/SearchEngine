As a symptom, diarrhea can be described as a decrease in stool consistency (increased fluidity), stools that cause urgency or abdominal discomfort, or an increase in the frequency of stool. Consistency is defined as the ratio of fecal water to the water-holding capacity of fecal insoluble solids, which are composed of bacterial mass and dietary fiber. Because it is difficult to measure stool consistency and because stool is predominantly (60 to 85%) water, stool weight becomes a reasonable surrogate of consistency.",

            "text": "To understand the osmotic, secretory, and inflammatory mechanisms of diarrhea, it is necessary to understand how the normal intestine handles fluid and solutes in health and disease. Whether a hypotonic meal, such as a steak and water, or a hypertonic meal, such as milk and a doughnut, is consumed, the volume of the meal is augmented by gastric, pancreatic, biliary, and duodenal secretions. The permeable duodenum then renders the meal approximately isotonic with an electrolyte content similar to that of plasma by the time it reaches the proximal jejunum. As the intestinal slurry moves toward the colon, the Na+ concentration in the luminal fluid remains constant, but Cl\u2212 is reduced to 60 to 70 mmol/L, and bicarbonate (HCO3\n\u2212) is increased to a similar concentration as the result of Cl\u2212 and HCO3\n\u2212 transport mechanisms in the enterocyte and HCO3\n\u2212 secretion in the ileum (Fig. 142-1B and C\n). In the colon, K++ is secreted, and the Na+ transport mechanism of the colonocyte, together with the low epithelial permeability, extracts Na+ and fluid from the stool. As a result, the Na+ content of stool decreases to 30 to 40 mmol/L; K++ increases from 5 to 10 mmol/L in the small bowel to 75 to 90 mmol/L; and poorly absorbed divalent cations, such as Mg2++ and Ca2++, are concentrated in stool to values of 5 to 100 mmol/L. The anion concentrations in the colon change drastically because bacterial degradation of carbohydrate (i.e., unabsorbed starches, sugars, and fiber) creates short-chain fatty acids that attain concentrations of 80 to 180 mmol/L; at colonic pH, organic anions, such as acetate, propionate, and butyrate, are present. In the setting of carbohydrate malabsorption, the generation of high concentrations of these short-chain fatty acids may decrease stool pH to 4 or lower. The osmolality of the stool is approximately that of plasma (280 to 300 mOsm/kg H2O) when it is passed.",

The diet supplies 2 L of this fluid; the remainder comes from salivary, gastric, hepatic, pancreatic, and intestinal secretions. The small intestine normally absorbs 8 to 9 L (80%) of this fluid and presents 1.5 L to the colon for absorption. Of the remaining fluid, the colon absorbs all but approximately 100 mL. Diarrhea can result from increased secretion by the small intestine or the colon if the maximal daily absorptive capacity of the colon (4 L) is exceeded. Alternatively, if the colon is diseased so that it cannot absorb even the 1.5 L normally presented to it by the small intestine, diarrhea results.",

E. coli heat-labile toxin, similar to cholera toxin, binds to the monosialoganglioside GM1 in the brush-border membrane, thereby resulting in the activation of adenylate cyclase and the elevation of intracellular cAMP. Cyclic AMP and cGMP stimulate intestinal chloride secretion (see Fig. 142-1C) and inhibit the nutrient-independent absorption of sodium and chloride (see Fig. 142-1B). Sodium-glucose absorption is not affected, hence the basis for oral rehydration therapy. Cholera toxin permanently binds to adenylate cyclase until the natural turnover of the intestinal epithelium in 5 to 7 days, thereby resulting in persistent secretion and severe diarrhea. Of the 10 to 15 cases of cholera reported in the United States each year, about 60% are travel associated.",

An important but poorly understood cause of diarrhea is enteral (tube) feeding (Chapter 223), particularly in critically ill patients, who often develop diarrhea.

            "text": "Acute watery diarrhea may be due to infections, food toxins, or medications, or the acute diarrhea may signal the onset of a chronic disease (Fig. 142-2\n; see TABLE 142-1, TABLE 142-2) (Chapters 310 through 320, 344, 345, 359, 360, 364, 365, 387, and 388Chapter 310Chapter 311Chapter 312Chapter 313Chapter 314Chapter 315Chapter 316Chapter 317Chapter 318Chapter 319Chapter 320Chapter 344Chapter 345Chapter 359Chapter 360Chapter 364Chapter 365Chapter 387Chapter 388). The diagnostic approach in patients with fever and watery or bloody diarrhea should focus on stool cultures for Campylobacter, Salmonella, and Shigella species. Routine stool culture is not indicated when diarrhea occurs after 3 to 5 days of hospitalization, except in patients with neutropenia, human immunodeficiency virus infection, or signs of enteric infection. In patients with a history of recent antibiotic use, hospitalization, or peripartum, stools for C. difficile toxin should be obtained. Organisms that cause diarrhea but are not routinely tested by clinical microbiology laboratories include Yersinia, Plesiomonas, enterohemorrhagic E. coli serotype O157:H7, Aeromonas, Cyclospora, microsporidia, and noncholera Vibrio. Parasites such as Giardia, Cryptosporidium, and Strongyloides can be difficult to detect in stool but may be diagnosed by stool antigen testing or intestinal biopsy. Despite all testing techniques available, 20 to 40% of acute infectious diarrheas remain undiagnosed.Treatment Goals for the treatment of diarrhea include fluid replacement, antidiarrheal agents, nutritional support, and antimicrobial therapy when indicated. Because death in patients with acute diarrhea is caused by dehydration, the first task is to assess the degree of dehydration and to replace fluid and electrolyte deficits.Fluid ReplacementSeverely dehydrated patients should be treated with intravenous Ringer's lactate or saline solution, with additional potassium and bicarbonate as needed. Oral rehydration solutions, which are used extensively to replace diarrheal fluid and electrolyte losses, are effective because they contain sodium, sugars, and, often, amino acids that use nutrient-dependent sodium uptake transporters. In alert patients with mild to moderate dehydration, oral rehydration solution is equally effective as intravenous hydration in repairing fluid and electrolyte losses. Oral rehydration solutions can be given to infants and children in volumes of 50 to 100 mL/kg over 4 to 6 hours; adults may need to drink 1000 mL/hr. Reduced-osmolarity solutions (Na++ 75 mmol/L, osmolarity 245 mmol/L versus Na++ 90 mmol/L, osmolarity 311 mmol/L in standard solutions) are better tolerated and effective in noncholera diarrhea but may cause hyponatremia in patients with high-volume diarrhea, particularly children. Glucose-based solutions, although effective in rehydrating the patient, may worsen the diarrhea. In contrast to glucose-based solutions, polymeric rice-based solutions decrease diarrhea in cholera victims; rice is digested to many glucose monomers that aid in the absorption of intestinal secretions. These solutions may not decrease stool output in acute diarrhea, but they will effectively rehydrate the patient despite continued diarrhea. After rehydration has been accomplished, oral rehydration solutions are given at rates equaling stool loss plus insensible losses until the diarrhea ceases.Reducing DiarrheaBismuth subsalicylate (Pepto-Bismol, 525 mg orally every 30 minutes to 1 hour for five doses, may repeat on day 2) is safe and efficacious in bacterial infectious diarrheas. Opiates and anticholinergic drugs are not recommended for invasive bacterial infectious diarrheas because these drugs paralyze intestinal motility and predispose to increased colonization, invasion, and prolonged excretion of infectious organisms. The opiate loperamide is safe in acute or traveler's diarrhea, provided that it is not given to patients with dysentery (high fever, with blood or pus in the stool), and especially when administered concomitantly with effective antibiotics. A combination of loperamide (2 mg orally four times a day) plus simethicone (125 mg orally four times a day) may reduce the abdominal cramps and duration of traveler's diarrhea. Racecadotril (100 mg orally three times a day in adults, 1.5 mg/kg of body weight orally three times a day in children), an intestinal enkephalinase inhibitor that is antisecretory but does not paralyze intestinal motility, is effective in the treatment of acute diarrhea in children and adults. The diarrhea associated with enteral nutrition (Chapter 223) often can be managed with pectin (4 g/kg body weight daily) or, if there are no contraindications, with loperamide (2 mg orally four times a day for 3 to 7 days, maximal dose 16 mg daily), and diarrhea is not a reason to stop tube feeding unless stool volumes exceed 1 L/day.Anxiolytics (e.g., diazepam 2 mg orally two to four times daily) and antiemetics (e.g., promethazine 12.5 to 25 mg orally once or twice daily) that decrease sensory perception may make symptoms more tolerable and are safe. Some foods or food-derived substances (green bananas, pectins [amylase-resistant starch], zinc) lessen the amount or duration of diarrhea in children. Unabsorbed amylase-resistant starches are metabolized in the colon to short-chain fatty acids that enhance fluid absorption. Zinc supplementation (20 mg of elemental zinc orally once a day) is effective in preventing recurrences of diarrhea in malnourished children; copper deficiency is a potential complication of prolonged zinc therapy.Probiotics may be of benefit in children with acute diarrhea, predominantly that due to rotavirus infection. Lactobacillus GG (1010 colony-forming units [CFU]/250 mL daily until diarrhea stops) added to an oral rehydration solution decreases the duration of diarrhea.AntibioticsWhile the clinician is awaiting stool culture results to guide specific therapy (Chapter 295), the fluoroquinolones (e.g., ciprofloxacin, 500 mg orally twice a day for 1 to 3 days, or levofloxacin, 500 mg orally daily for 1 to 3 days) are the treatment of choice when antibiotics are indicated (see Fig. 142-2). Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (one double-strength tablet orally twice a day for 5 days or two single-strength tablets orally twice a day for 5 days) is second-line therapy. If the symptom complex suggests Campylobacter infection, azithromycin (500 mg orally once a day for 3 days) should be added. Regardless of the cause of infectious diarrhea, patients should be treated with antibiotics if they are immunosuppressed; have valvular, vascular, or orthopedic prostheses; have congenital hemolytic anemias (especially if salmonellosis is involved); or are extremely young or old.Certain infectious diarrheas should be treated with antibiotics, including those associated with shigellosis (Chapter 317), cholera (Chapter 310), pseudomembranous enterocolitis (Chapter 304), parasitic infestations (Chapters 358 to 360 and 365Chapter 358Chapter 359Chapter 360Chapter 365), and sexually transmitted diseases (Chapter 293). Treatment of E. coli serotype O157:H7 infection is not recommended at present because current antibiotics do not appear to be helpful and the incidence of complications (hemolytic-uremic syndrome) may be greater after antibiotic therapy. Antibiotics are not effective for viral diarrhea or cryptosporidiosis.For traveler's diarrhea, ciprofloxacin (500 mg orally two times a day for 3 days) is an effective treatment. The nonabsorbable antibiotic rifaximin (200 mg taken orally three times a day or 400 mg two times a day for 3 days) is safe and effective for treatment of traveler's diarrhea in Mexico, but it may not be effective against Campylobacter and Shigella infections.Fluoroquinolone-resistant and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole-resistant strains of Shigella, E. coli, Salmonella, Campylobacter, and C. difficile have emerged. Azithromycin, 500 mg orally on day 1 and 250 mg orally once a day for 4 days, may be an effective alternative treatment for resistant strains of Shigella and Campylobacter and for traveler's diarrhea acquired in Mexico.If C. difficile is suspected on an epidemiologic basis, metronidazole (250 mg orally four times a day or 500 mg orally three times a day for 10 days) or oral vancomycin (125 to 250 mg orally four times a day for 10 days) should be prescribed. In patients with recurrent C. difficile infection that is associated with low serum antibody titers to toxin A, immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies against toxin A and B1 or fecal bacteriotherapy may decrease recurrence rates. Non\u2013C. difficile antibiotic-induced diarrhea is generally mild and self-limited, and it usually clears spontaneously or in response to cholestyramine therapy (4 g orally four times a day for 2 weeks).Treatment for chemotherapy-induced and radiation-induced mild to moderate diarrhea includes loperamide (2 mg orally four times a day) and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (e.g., naproxen, 250 to 500 mg orally twice daily). Octreotide may be an effective treatment in those with severe diarrhea in doses up to 700 \u00b5g administered subcutaneously daily.\n",

A qualitative or quantitative test for fecal fat is positive in individuals whose pancreas is more than 90% destroyed. Noninvasive tests of pancreatic function are not sensitive enough to detect mild to moderate insufficiency, so the secretin stimulation test is preferred (Table 142-4\n) if it can be obtained. A modified oral glucose tolerance test that shows late (120 to 180 minutes) hypoglycemia and an early (30 minutes) rise in hematocrit with an increased pulse rate suggests the dumping syndrome in patients with consistent symptoms. Small bowel barium study to assess transit time may be helpful in the diagnosis.Treatment Pancreatic enzyme replacement and analgesics are the mainstays of treatment for chronic pancreatitis (Chapter 146). It is difficult to correct fat malabsorption completely with exogenous pancreatic enzymes because of their inactivation by acid and pepsin in the stomach. Normally, 28,000 U of lipase is present in the duodenal lumen with each meal. A high lipase-containing pancreatic enzyme preparation (25,000 to 40,000 U of lipase in the form of uncoated enzymes or enteric-coated, pH-sensitive microspheres) should be prescribed with each meal. Mini-microsphere preparations (e.g., 20,000 U of lipase taken orally with each meal) may be best tolerated owing to their small capsule size. Pancreatic proteases present in enzyme preparations may reduce abdominal pain by inactivating cholecystokinin-releasing factor in the duodenum. Uncoated preparations may be more effective in pain relief because coated preparations release enzymes predominantly distal to the duodenum. A histamine-2 receptor antagonist (e.g., ranitidine, 150 mg orally taken two times a day) or a proton pump inhibitor (e.g., lansoprazole, 15 to 30 mg orally once a day) should be added to uncoated pancreatic enzyme replacement therapy in patients with a poor response.In the dumping syndrome, treatment is with a diet that is low in concentrated sugars divided into six small meals. Administration of pectin (15 g with each meal) may slow gastric emptying. In patients who are refractory to dietary measures, a short-acting somatostatin analogue (e.g., octreotide, 25 to 200 \u00b5g subcutaneously three times a day) or the better tolerated long-acting octreotide preparation (10 to 20 mg subcutaneously monthly) improves dumping symptoms. In patients with predominant reactive hypoglycemia 1 to 3 hours after a meal (late dumping), an \u03b1-glycosidase hydrolase inhibitor (e.g., acarbose, 50 to 100 mg orally three times daily) that blocks carbohydrate absorption in the small bowel may be beneficial. Continuous tube feeding is also effective.\n",

The noninvasive tests with a sensitivity and specificity comparable to intestinal culture are the glucose hydrogen breath test and the 14C- or 13C-d-xylose breath test; in individuals with low vitamin B12 levels, a Schilling test before and after antibiotic therapy can be diagnostic (Chapter 167).Treatment The goals of treatment are to correct the structural or motility defect, if possible; to eradicate offending bacteria; and to provide nutritional support. Acid-reducing agents should be stopped, if possible. Treatment with antibiotics should be based on culture results whenever possible; otherwise, empirical treatment is given. Rifaximin (400 mg orally three times a day) is effective,6 but less so in individuals with an excluded (blind) intestinal loop. Tetracycline (250 to 500 mg orally four times a day) or a broad-spectrum antibiotic against aerobes and enteric anaerobes (ciprofloxacin, 500 mg orally twice a day; amoxicillin\u2013clavulanic acid, 250 to 500 mg orally three times a day; cephalexin, 250 mg orally four times a day with metronidazole, 250 mg three times a day) should be given for 14 days.

Bile acid diarrhea responds to cholestyramine (2 to 4 g taken at breakfast, lunch, and dinner). If more than 100 cm of ileum is diseased or resected, bile salt losses (>3 g/day) in the colon exceed the capacity for increased bile salt synthesis in the liver, the bile salt pool shrinks, and micelle formation is impaired.

Gliadins and similar prolamins with high proline content are relatively resistant to digestion by human proteases. A 33-mer peptide that is a natural digestion product of \u03b12-gliadin may be important in the pathogenesis of celiac disease. This peptide resists terminal digestion by intestinal brush-border proteases and contains three previously identified antigenic epitopes. It also reacts with tissue transglutaminase and stimulates human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DQ2-restricted intestinal T-cell clones from individuals with celiac disease.",

More than 90% of northern Europeans with celiac disease have the DQ2 heterodimer encoded by alleles DQA1*0501 and DQB1*0201, compared with 20 to 30% of controls. A smaller celiac group carries HLA DQ8. The strongest candidate non-HLA alleles identified in genome-wide association studies are 4q27 and 3q28. The DQ2 protein expressed on antigen-presenting cells has positively charged binding pockets; tTG (the autoantigen recognized by EMA) may enhance intestinal inflammation by deamidation of select glutamine residues in gliadin to negatively charged glutamic acid. In the deamidated form, most gliadin peptides have a higher binding affinity for DQ2 and are more potent stimulants of gluten-sensitized T cells. Villous atrophy may be caused by inflammation that is triggered by \u03b3-interferon released from DQ2- or DQ8-restricted CD4 T cells in the lamina propria. Alternatively, intraepithelial lymphocytes may directly kill intestinal epithelial cells under the influence of IL-15 released from stressed enterocytes.",

An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test to detect antibodies against tTG has equal sensitivity to the EMA test but is less specific. The newer anti-deamidated gliadin (a biotinylated synthetic \u03b3-gliadin peptide with glutamic acid substituted for glutamine) IgA and IgG antibody immunofluorometric assay has a sensitivity and specificity that approaches that of EMA. The anti-tTG IgA antibody test, when obtained with a serum IgA level, is a cost-effective strategy for screening high-risk groups; very high titers of the anti-tTG IgA and EMA antibodies are virtually diagnostic of celiac disease. Patients with mild disease may have negative antibody studies. Anti-tTG, gliadin peptide, and EMA IgA antibodies tests are negative in individuals with selective IgA deficiency (present in up to 2.6% of individuals with celiac disease). In these patients, anti-tTG or gliadin peptide IgG antibodies may be helpful in diagnosis. In equivocal cases (negative serology and equivocal biopsy or positive serology and normal biopsy), HLA genotyping is useful to exclude the diagnosis of celiac disease in persons who lack the DQ2 or DQ8 gene.Treatment Treatment consists of a lifelong gluten-free diet. Wheat, rye, and barley grains should be excluded from the diet. Rice and corn grains are tolerated. Oats (if not contaminated by wheat grain) are tolerated by most. Early referral to a reputable celiac support group or website is often helpful in maintaining dietary compliance. Owing to secondary lactase deficiency, a lactose-free diet should be recommended until symptoms improve. Bone densitometry should be performed on all individuals with celiac disease because up to 70% have osteopenia or osteoporosis. Patients with diarrhea and weight loss should be screened for vitamin and mineral deficiencies. Documented deficiencies of vitamins and minerals should be replenished (see Table 142-4), and women of childbearing age should take folic acid supplements. Bone mass often improves on a gluten-free diet alone. Patients with vitamin D or calcium deficiency should receive supplements (Chapter 225), with the dose monitored by 25-OH vitamin D levels and a 24-hour urine test for calcium.\n",

About one third of patients have cardiac involvement, most commonly culture-negative endocarditis. Occasionally, individuals present with ocular or neurologic disease without gastrointestinal symptoms. Men are affected more commonly than women, particularly white men. The organism responsible for causing Whipple's disease is a gram-positive actinomycete, Tropheryma whippelii. The epidemiology and pathogenesis of Whipple's disease are poorly understood. The prevalence of the disease is higher in farmers compared with other workers, which suggests that the organism lives in the soil. Using the polymerase chain reaction, T. whippelii has been detected in sewage and in duodenal biopsy specimens, gastric juice, saliva, and stool of individuals without clinical disease. Whether the latter represents a carrier state or the presence of nonpathogenic organisms is not known. Immunologic defects and an association with the HLA-B27 gene may be disease factors. Small intestinal biopsy shows villous blunting and infiltration of the lamina propria with large macrophages that stain positive with the periodic acid\u2013Schiff method and are filled with the organism. It is important to distinguish these macrophages from macrophages infected with M. avium-intracellulare complex, which stain positive on acid-fast staining and are found in individuals with AIDS.

In comparison, individuals with fewer than 100 cm of jejunum and no colon have high jejunostomy outputs and often require intravenous fluids or parenteral nutrition to survive. These individuals waste sodium, chloride, bicarbonate, magnesium, zinc, and water in their ostomy effluent. Dietary modifications should include a high-salt, nutrient-rich diet given in small meals. An oral rehydration solution with a sodium concentration greater than 90 mmol/L is absorbed best. Oral vitamin and mineral doses higher than the usual U.S. recommended daily allowances are required (Table 142-5\n). Vitamin B12 should be given parenterally (500 to 1000 \u00b5g subcutaneously every month). Magnesium deficiencies are often difficult to replenish with oral magnesium because of its osmotic effect in the intestinal lumen. A liquid magnesium preparation added to an oral rehydration solution and sipped throughout the day may minimize magnesium-induced fluid losses. Potent antimotility agents, such as tincture of opium (0.5 to 1 mL orally four times a day), often are needed to slow transit and maximize contact time for nutrient absorption. High-volume jejunostomy outputs can be lessened by inhibiting endogenous secretions with a proton pump inhibitor (e.g., omeprazole, 40 mg orally one to two times a day, or lansoprazole, 30 mg orally one to two times a day) and, in severe cases, octreotide (100 to 250 \u00b5g subcutaneously three times a day; if effective, convert to an equivalent long-acting monthly dosage). The benefit of octreotide may be offset by its potential to inhibit intestinal adaptation and impair pancreatic enzyme secretion with doses greater than 300 \u00b5g/day.In the most severe cases, supplemental calories must be provided by nocturnal tube feeding or parenteral nutrition.

            "text": "Ileal malabsorption of bile salts results in the stimulation of colonic fluid secretion and watery diarrhea. Three types of bile acid malabsorption induce diarrhea. Type 1 results when severe disease (e.g., Crohn's disease), resection, or bypass of the distal ileum allows bile salts to escape absorption (see earlier). Type 2 may rarely be congenital, owing to a defect in the apical sodium bile acid transporter, or may more commonly be idiopathic. The idiopathic type has been associated with decreased levels of FGF19, an intestinal fibroblast growth factor that normally downregulates bile salt synthesis in the liver. The result is increased bile salt production that overwhelms reabsorption in the ileum. Type 3 is caused by various conditions, including prior cholecystectomy, celiac disease, pancreatic insufficiency, microscopic colitis, bacterial overgrowth, gastric surgery, or vagotomy. Postulated mechanisms include a bile salt storage problem, increased production, decreased recycling, or saturation of absorption.Treatment Diarrhea due to types 1 and 2 often responds to cholestyramine, 2 to 4 g given orally two to four times daily, or the more potent and better tolerated bile salt binder, colesevelam, 625 mg tablet orally two to six times daily. Fat-soluble vitamin deficiency is a potential risk with chronic use of bile salt binders.Although many patients with type 3 respond to cholestyramine, some do not. In these patients, motility-altering drugs such as opiates (e.g., loperamide, 2 to 4 mg orally two to four times daily) and anticholinergics (e.g., hyoscyamine sulfate, 0.125 to 0.250 mg orally two to four times daily) may be of benefit.\n",

            "text": "The normal stool osmotic gap, which is the difference between stool osmolality (or 290 mOsm) and twice the stool Na++ and K++ concentrations, is 50 to 125. In secretory diarrheas, the colon's capacity for adjusting electrolyte concentrations is overwhelmed, the stool osmotic gap is less than 50, and stool electrolytes more nearly resemble plasma electrolytes (+Na++ concentrations are usually >90 mmol/L, K+ concentrations usually <10 mmol/L), except for higher HCO3\n\u2212 concentrations (usually >50 mmol/L). In osmotic diarrhea, the presence of uncharged solute or unmeasured cation in the colonic lumen draws in water, depresses stool Na++ (usually <60 mmol/L) and K+ concentrations, and results in a stool osmotic gap >125. Stools with Na++ concentrations between 60 and 90 mmol/L and calculated osmotic gaps between 50 and 100 can result from either secretory or malabsorptive abnormalities. Patients with Mg2++-induced diarrhea may be diagnosed by fecal Mg2+ values of more than 50 mmol/L. Sodium anion\u2013induced diarrheas (Na2SO4, Na2PO4) mimic secretory diarrhea because the stool Na++ content is high (>90 mmol/L), and there is no osmotic gap; this diarrhea may be diagnosed by determining stool Cl\u2212 concentration because these anions displace stool Cl\u2212 resulting in a depressed stool Cl\u2212 value (usually <20 mmol/L).Treatment of Chronic Diarrhea Antidiarrheal TherapyAntidiarrheal agents are of two types: those used for mild to moderate diarrheas and those used for severe secretory diarrheas. A major shortcoming of opiates, the most commonly prescribed antidiarrheal agents, is that they have no antisecretory effect. Rather, they act by decreasing intestinal motility, thereby allowing longer contact time with the mucosa for improved fluid absorption. The exception is racecadotril, an enkephalinase inhibitor, that blocks intestinal fluid secretion without affecting motility.Bulk-forming agents (psyllium [7 g in 8 ounces water orally up to five times a day] and methylcellulose [three to six tablets twice a day with 300 mL of water]) act by binding water and increasing the consistency of stool. Pectin has been shown to have proabsorptive activity. These agents may be useful in patients with fecal incontinence. Bismuth subsalicylates (524 mg orally every hour up to eight doses a day) have mild antisecretory and antimotility effects and are effective and safe in mild diarrheas. Agents that bind bile salts (e.g., cholestyramine, 2 to 4 g orally two to four times a day) are effective in the treatment of bile acid diarrheas but may worsen diarrhea in patients with ileal resection or disease of more than 100 cm of ileum.The opiates may be symptomatically useful in mild to moderate diarrheas. Paregoric, deodorized tincture of opium, codeine, and diphenoxylate with atropine largely have been supplanted by loperamide. Loperamide does not pass the blood-brain barrier and has a high first-pass metabolism in the liver; it has a high therapeutic-to-toxic ratio and is essentially devoid of addiction potential. It is safe in adults, even in total doses of 24 mg/day. The usual dose is 2 to 4 mg two to four times daily. Opiates may be harmful in patients with severe diarrheas because large volumes of fluid may pool in the intestinal lumen (third space), and stool output is no longer a reliable gauge for replacing fluid losses. The antimotility effects are a problem in infectious diarrheas because stasis may enhance bacterial invasion and delay clearance of microorganisms from the bowel. Opiates and anticholinergics also are dangerous in severe inflammatory bowel disease or severe C. difficile infection, where they may precipitate megacolon.Antidiarrhea agents that are used for the treatment of severe secretory and inflammatory diarrheas generally have profiles with more serious side effects. The somatostatin analogue octreotide (initial dose, 100 to 600 \u00b5g subcutaneously in two to four divided doses daily; maximal dose, 1500 \u00b5g daily) lessens diarrhea in the carcinoid syndrome and in neuroendocrine tumors because it inhibits hormone secretion by the tumor. It is also effective in the treatment of dumping syndrome and chemotherapy-related diarrheas. Long-acting subcutaneous octreotide preparations (20 to 30 mg intramuscularly intragluteally every month) are now available for once-a-month dosing. Octreotide can suppress pancreatic enzyme secretion and make diarrhea worse; it also may be of only limited usefulness in short-bowel syndrome and AIDS diarrhea. Agents such as phenothiazine and calcium-channel blockers have mild antisecretory effects, but side effects limit their use. Clonidine (initial dose, 0.1 mg orally twice daily, titrated slowly to a maximal dose of 0.5 to 0.6 mg twice daily) is most useful in opiate withdrawal diarrhea and is sometimes useful in diabetic diarrhea; postural hypotension may limit its use, particularly in patients with diabetes. Alosetron (0.5 mg orally twice daily for four weeks, maximal dose 1 mg orally twice daily) may be justified for severe diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome; associations with ischemic colitis and severe constipation have limited its use. Indomethacin (250 to 500 mg orally twice daily), a cyclooxygenase blocker that inhibits prostaglandin production, is useful in the treatment of diarrheas caused by acute radiation, AIDS, or villous adenomas of the rectum or colon; occasionally, it may be useful in neuroendocrine tumors and food allergy. For eosinophilic gastroenteritis, corticosteroids (prednisone, 20 to 40 mg orally once a day for 7 to 10 days) are the mainstay of therapy, but disodium cromoglycate (200 mg orally four times daily) also may be useful; food elimination diets are not usually effective. Treatment of inflammatory bowel disease is described in Chapter 143.\n",

            "text": "FIGURE\u00a0142-1: Mechanisms of intestinal transport of water and electrolytes. A, Intestinal sodium absorption. Sodium is actively absorbed in villus cells of the small intestine and surface cells of the colon. The sodium-potassium adenosine triphosphatase (Na++,K++-ATPase) present on the cell basolateral membrane maintains a low intracellular Na+++ concentration and an electronegative cell interior favoring Na+++ movement across the apical membrane from lumen into cell. In the small intestine, glucose and galactose are taken up with sodium and water at the apical membrane by the sodium-glucose ligand transporter (SGLT1). Several different sodium-dependent amino acid carriers, some with overlapping substrate specificities, transport cationic, anionic, and neutral amino acids into villus cells. Dipeptides and tripeptides are transported by a hydrogen-coupled oligopeptide carrier, PepT1, that is driven by luminal hydrogen ions generated by the epithelial Na+/H++ exchanger. Fructose is taken up by the facilitative glucose transporter (GLUT5). B, Sodium also is absorbed by nutrient-independent transport processes in the small intestine and colon. The Na++/H++ (NHE) and Cl\u2212/HCO3\u2212 (DRA) exchangers are inhibited by agents that elevate intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), or calcium. C, Chloride secretion by intestinal crypt cells. Chloride can be secreted actively throughout the small intestine and colon. Intracellular mediators of secretion (cAMP, cGMP, Ca2++) open apical Cl\u2212 channels (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator [CFTR], calcium-activated chloride channel [TMEM16]) and basolateral K++ channels. Chloride moves from crypt cells into the intestinal lumen, favoring movement of Cl\u2212 from the blood into cells by the Na++/K++/2Cl\u2212 cotransporter (NKCC1). Bicarbonate (HCO3\u2212) also may be secreted via the CFTR channel. D, Regulation of intestinal water and electrolyte transport. Normally, the intestine is in a net absorptive state under the control of extrinsic adrenergic nerves from the sympathetic nervous system. Guanylin, the natural ligand for the Escherichia coli stable-toxin receptor (membrane-bound guanylyl cyclase [GC-C]), may be important in regulating local chloride secretion. The normal tone of the intestine is modified by the enteric nervous system, endocrine and inflammatory cells in the intestinal mucosa, and circulating hormones. The enteric nervous system releases a variety of neurotransmitters, some that stimulate chloride secretion (e.g., vasoactive intestinal peptide [VIP], acetylcholine) and others that promote sodium absorption (e.g., enkephalins, neuropeptide Y). Hormones produced locally from enterochromaffin cells (ECC) in the intestinal epithelium and inflammatory mediators released from immune cells directly affect enterocytes and nearby nerves. Circulating hormones (e.g., aldosterone, glucocorticoids) enhance sodium absorption in the intestine. Glucocorticoids also inhibit release of arachidonic acid and production of prostaglandin by inflammatory cells.",
