HEMS teams always include both a paramedic and an emergency physician [10, 11]. In Switzerland, on the other hand, EMS teams are mainly composed of well-trained paramedics, rather than medical physicians depending on regional differences.

Expected mortality was calculated according to RISC II prognostic score which was developed and validated with TR-DGU data [14]. A 95% confidence interval was provided for SMRs.

Furthermore, in-field intubation and chest tube placements were performed less frequently in Switzerland.

Pre-hospital intubation is frequently associated with altered neurological status and more specifically a reduced initial GCS score. Even though similar proportions of cases with an initial GCS < 9 were documented in both cohorts, intubation rates were lower in the Swiss cohort. One can assume that the paramedic-based allocation system in Switzerland leads to a lower intubation rate. As success rates of pre-hospital intubation are higher in physicians compared to non-physicians, it is likely that paramedics are more reluctant to intubate patients [21]. Thereby, the findings of the current study underline the benefits of emergency physician presence (reflected by higher intubation rates in the German cohort) in the treatment of craniocerebral injuries. Increased intubation rates may partly explain enhanced outcome observed in neuro-trauma patients treated by emergency physicians compared with treatment systems with lower pre-hospital emergency physician attendance [22, 23].",

Nevertheless, it may also suggest different transfusion habits between both countries, especially, as transfusion habits in certain Swiss-level-one trauma centers changed markedly within the last decade [28].
