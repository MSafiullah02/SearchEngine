            "text": "The global dissemination of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the fatal clinical results of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) urge scientists and physicians to discover the most potent prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines to combat this deadliest scourge of human society. Live recombinant microorganisms have been used as vectors to develop vaccines for eliciting broad array of immune responses against HIV/AIDS. Antigens of HIV can be brought into live and replication competent or incompetent microorganisms by molecular technologies. Appropriate expression of such antigens can be achieved under suitable conditions. When these recombinant vaccines are introduced to mammalian host, multiple immune responses, especially cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) activity will be elicited against the products of HIV genes carried by the vectors. A number of live viral vectors including poxvirus (Ondondo et al., 2006), alphavirus (Perri et al., 2003), adenovirus (Vinner et al., 2006), adeno-associated virus (Tatalick et al., 2005), rabies virus (Tan et al., 2005), measles virus (Lorin et al., 2004), and vesicular stomatitis virus (Egan et al., 2004) have been used as potential vectors for the development of HIV vaccines. Early-phase clinical trials of some of these viral vector vaccines have performed in humans. In addition, recombinant bacterial vectors, such as Listeria monocytogenes (Rayevskaya et al., 2003), Shigella (Xu et al., 2003), Mycobacterium bovis BCG (Kawahara et al., 2002), and Salmonella (Kotton et al., 2006) have also been investigated as potential vectors for the delivery of HIV antigens. Since bacterial live vectors can be produced with less cost and stored via lyophilization, they offer many advantages over viral vectors.",

Genetic backgrounds of this bacterium and types of virulence mutations have been well characterized. Recombinant Salmonella Typhi vaccines are quite easy to massively produce and store, which make these vaccinations economically more feasible and accessible. Recombinant S. Typhi has been used as oral typhoid vaccines and as live vector to deliver heterologous antigens that can stimulate mucosal, humoral, and cellular immune responses after immunizing animals via mucosal surfaces (Kotton, 2004). Foreign antigens can be stably expressed in the bacteria either from its chromosome harboring the antigen gene or from a plasmid carrying the gene (Stephens et al., 2006). We have previously constructed a S. enterica serovar Typhi strain carrying the nucleocapsid (N) gene of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) integrated into the bacterial chromosome, which could elicit efficiently immune responses in vaccinated mice (Luo et al., 2007).",

IgA antibody responses to gp120 protein from feces, vaginal secretions, and saliva of immunized mice were analyzed. Results from ELISA showed that high levels of gp120-specific IgA antibody activities were found only in feces of mice vaccinated with strains ST012 and ST014, but not in mice immunized with strains ST011, ST013, or PBS (Fig. 5\n). We also noticed that gp120-specific IgA antibody activities were not detected in vaginal secretions or saliva of mice immunized with all the four vaccine strains (data not shown).",

It is widely accepted that CMI against internal viral proteins of HIV is essential for eliminating infected cells because these viral proteins are structurally important and rarely generate mutant epitopes (Sacha et al., 2007). To induce durable and effective CMI responses, these viral proteins have to be endogenously synthesized to ensure their entering into proper antigen presentation pathway.

Chromosomal integration generally increases the stability of foreign antigens and protects them from degradation by bacterial proteases (Kotton, 2004, Williams and Szalay, 1983). The Gag antigen expression (Fig. 3B) and Gag-specific CTL activity (one of the most important CMI responses) (Fig. 7) were detected in mice immunized with this vaccine strain. Cellular immunity may prevent virus from attacking new susceptible cells, while antibodies play important roles in the first line of defense. As for the development of HIV vaccines, the viral envelop glycoprotein gp120 has always been the immunogen of choice (Giri et al., 2004). Since the HIV gp120 is responsible for attachment to susceptible cells and is analogous to the highly immunogenic, its specific antibodies are considered to be crucial in the initial rounds of the campaign against HIV infection. In addition to CTL response, this recombinant vaccine strain could produce gp120 protein in mammalian cells (Fig. 3) and stimulate gp120-specific antibodies production in vaccinated mice (Fig. 4, Fig. 5). There is evidence that multiple immune responses against multiple viral antigens (at least two) would establish superiority effects in the development of HIV vaccine (Amara and Robinson, 2002).",

Unlike the gp120 protein expressed from the eukaryotic plasmid, the level of Gag protein expressed from S. Typhi chromosome is relatively low when introduced into mammalian host. Thus, less anti-Gag antibodies (IgG or IgA) were produced in our study. This result was consistent with other report, which also showed that Gag-specific antibodies were hardly detected (Breton et al., 2007).

Thus, we chose intranasal immunization instead of orogastric immunization for the induction of mucosal and systemic anti-HIV immune responses in this study. It is generally agreed that orogastric route for live bacterial vectors may be inefficient because the gastrointestinal tract contains commensal bacteria, other microorganisms, stomach acid, proteolytic enzymes, together with food might interfere with vaccine uptake and suppress immune responses (Galen et al., 1997, Pickett et al., 2000). In contrast, the nasal cavity surface provides a smooth environment that is replete with antigen-reactive lymphoid elements, including T cells, B cells, and a large number of cellular components involved in the induction of immune responses. Intranasal immunization could lead to the induction of distant mucosal immune responses (Ogra et al., 2001, Wu et al., 1997). The genital, rectal, and oral sites are considered to be most important for induction of strong mucosal immune responses to block the invasion of HIV through sexual intercourse.",
