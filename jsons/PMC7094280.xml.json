One CoV component critical for pathogenesis is the envelope (E) protein, as reported in several coronaviruses, e.g., MERS and SARS-CoVs [[12], [13], [14]]. The CoV envelope (E) proteins are short polypeptides (76\u2013109 amino acids) with a single \u03b1-helical transmembrane (TM) domain [[15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21]] that form homopentameric ion channels (IC) with poor ion selectivity [22,23]. CoV E proteins are mostly found in the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) [[24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29]]. In animal models, deletion of SARS-CoV E protein reduced pathogenicity and mortality [30], whereas cellular models displayed up- and down-regulation of stress response and inflammation host genes, respectively [31]. The importance of E protein in pathogenesis has led to the development of LAVs based on deletion of E protein in SARS- and MERS-CoVs, although this led to compensatory mechanisms that recover virulence [32,33].",

ETR only produced reasonably good NMR spectra in DPC when SDS was also present [19], but since SDS disrupts ETR oligomerization, we searched for other micellar environments. Lipid-like LMPG was found to produce good NMR spectra for ETR, although not for EFL. Therefore, ETR in LMPG was used in subsequent experiments. The use of the ETR construct instead of the full-length E protein (EFL) is justified since the 13C\u03b1 chemical shifts of ETR and EFL protein in SDS or SDS/DPC were almost identical for residues 8\u201365 [19]. In addition, the secondary structure, obtained by CD/FTIR [18], of ETR and EFL is similar and predominantly \u03b1-helical, whether in DPC, SDS, mixed (1:2 M ratio) SDS/DPC micelles or DMPC synthetic membranes [18,19].",

At the lowest P/D molar ratio (1:1000), ETR migrates as a ladder of increasingly larger oligomers where the fastest migrating band is assumed to correspond to monomers (lower star), ~8 kDa, whereas at a high P/D ratio (1:125), ETR migrates with an apparent molecular weight of ~150 kDa. These results are almost identical to those obtained previously for MERS-CoV E, for which a pentameric oligomer was determined using analytical ultracentrifugation in C-14 betaine. In that case, migration in BN-PAGE gels was also observed as a single ~150 kDa band in detergents DPC, DHPC and LMPG [21], and the ladder observed at higher detergent concentration conveniently provided an internal reference that served as a oligomeric size marker. Similar to ETR, by comparison with that ladder, we confidently assigned the single band observed for MERS-CoV E to pentameric oligomers. It should be noted that in BN-PAGE gels of membrane proteins, molecular weights can appear up to 80% higher due to a contribution of the dye [54]. We have shown this for tetrameric AQPZ, which migrated at ~170 kDa instead of the expected ~100 kDa, and with a viroporin, the SH protein pentamer [41], which migrated as ~66 kDa instead of ~40 kDa. In the case of envelope E proteins, the effect is even more pronounced. In both SARS-CoV ETR and MERS-CoV E, the pentameric form appears at ~150 kDa, therefore the monomer should appear at >30 kDa. This is consistent with its migration above the AQPZ monomer (~25 kDa). The ladder ends with a pentamer, which is the predominant band at high P/D ratios. The proportion of large oligomers naturally decrease at low P/D ratios, but a significant amount of pentamer species is still present even at the 1:1000 P/D ratio. The NMR data was collected at a P/D molar ratio of 1:300, which should mostly be formed by pentamers.",

The oligomerization in DPC/SDS was not homogeneous, which precluded a more detailed study, whereas in LMPG a predominant oligomeric size is observed at a high protein-detergent ratio (Fig. 4). Therefore, in LMPG the changes observed after HMA addition should more reliably represent the binding of HMA to ETR.

The rotational pitch of the residues in the TM domain of this pentameric model were measured individually [35] and compared to those from the computational models A and B [15] (Fig. 8D). While values for residues 25\u201327 are closer to model B, the rest of the sequence is similar to model A, except at residue 28 which deviates from both models. For comparison, the rotational pitch close to model A for residues in ETM obtained previously by NMR in DPC micelles [20] is also shown. The present model has been constructed independently from A and B model templates, and the result appears to be a hybrid between the two [15]. This is not surprising since the in silico study assumed a certain rigidity in the TM \u03b1-helices [15]. Most of the residues in the model we report have an orientation consistent with model A. This is not surprising, since model A had the lowest energy value for each individual E protein homologs [15]. However, the model gets closer to model B in the turn that contains V25 (Fig. 8D). This enables V25 to adopt a more interhelical orientation consistent with the revertant mutants that appeared in vivo [30]. Additionally, the helix kink region suggested by infrared dichroism data in lipid bilayers [16] is also observed, which supports the validity of the membrane-mimic environment used herein.",
