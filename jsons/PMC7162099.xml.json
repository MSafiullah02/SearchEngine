The best yields were achieved when the reactions were carried out using [Pd(PPh3)4] (6 mol %) as the catalyst, whereas employment of other catalysts, such as [Pd(OAc)2]/XPhos, resulted in a decrease of the yield. Similar conditions were previously used in Suzuki reactions of related bis(triflates).22 The use of potassium phosphate (K3PO4) as the base and 1,4\u2010dioxane (110 \u00b0C, 4 h) gave optimal yields. The best yield was obtained for the reaction of simple phenylboronic acid. The lowest yield was obtained for 4\u2010fluorophenylboronic acid, which might be attributed to its low nucleophilicity (owing to the electron\u2010withdrawing fluorine atom). The structure of 4 e was independently confirmed by X\u2010ray crystal structure analysis (Figure 1).25\n",

Therefore, the yields of mono\u2010substituted products 5 are often less than the yields of the corresponding disubstituted products 4, because of practical difficulties during the chromatographic purification of products 5 and loss of material (because the R\nf values of impurities were close the R\nf value of the desired product. In case of the synthesis of products 4, the reactions were much cleaner and the chromatographic purifications much easier without much loss of material. All products were isolated in pure form by chromatographic purification. During the optimization, the temperature played a crucial role. It proved to be important to perform the reaction at 70 instead of 110 \u00b0C to induce a good selectivity.",
