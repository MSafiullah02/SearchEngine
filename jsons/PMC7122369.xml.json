As its name implies, GE is characterized by inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract and often associated with symptoms of diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, and abdominal cramping and pain. GE and its associated diarrheal diseases remain as one of the top causes of death in the world especially in developing countries and in young children with an estimated death toll of four to six million per year [1, 2]. GE is also the most common disease and the leading cause of morbidity in the developed world. For example, it is suggested that in the United States (USA), everyone is likely to suffer from viral GE at least once a year, 610,000 will be hospitalized, and at least 4,000 will die from this disease [1]. GE can be caused by a variety of pathogens including viruses, bacteria, and parasites and by ingestion of noninfectious toxins or medications, with viruses as the most common offending agents [1]. Norovirus (NoV) and rotavirus are the most common viruses that cause viral GE, while adenovirus, astrovirus, coronavirus, and parechovirus are also known to cause GE in humans [1\u20133].",

They were first discovered and characterized in their prototype virus, the Norwalk virus (NV) in 1972 [6, 7]. Studies of NV revealed that NoVs are non-enveloped viruses with an RNA genome surrounded by a round capsid protein shell approximately 38 nm in diameter [8]. Classification of NoVs, however, has proved difficult and controversial until the recent development of molecular biology tools. Since there is no culture system available to grow these viruses in vitro, accurate serotyping based on neutralization is not possible [9]. Instead, classification of NoV had to rely on cross-challenge studies in volunteers and immune cross-reactivity analysis with electron microscopy [10\u201313], which lacks accuracy and reproducibility due to the cross-reactivity of antibodies [14].",

Within the five genotypes, GI and GIV strains are found to infect humans exclusively, and GII are found in both humans and pigs, while GIII and GV strains are animal viruses that infect cattle and murine species, respectively [15, 16].

ORF1 encodes a polyprotein that is processed by viral protease 3CLpro into the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and approximately five other nonstructural proteins including p48, the nucleoside triphosphatase, p22, VPg, and 3CLpro [20, 21]. The two structural proteins, the major (VP1) and minor (VP2) capsid proteins, are encoded by ORF2 and ORF3, respectively [19, 22]. Structural analysis of NoV has revealed that each viral capsid is composed of 90 dimers of VP1 in a T = 3 icosahedral symmetry [8, 23]. VP1 folds into two domains: a shell (S) domain that is responsible for initiating capsid assembly and icosahedral contacts and a protruding domain (P), containing two subdomains of P1 and P2, that enhance the stability of the capsid by providing intermolecular contacts between VP1 dimers [24].",

As a result, NoVs are highly contagious, spread rapidly, and their outbreaks commonly occur in various social places and settings where people share common food and water sources or are in close physical proximity, such as cruise ships, schools, military units, nursing homes, daycare centers, hospitals, restaurants, and catered events [29, 36\u201339].",

Consequently, these outbreaks often lead to the infection of thousands of people and the closure of facilities and businesses [43, 44]. For example, NoV has been identified as one of the most common pathogens for hospital ward closures [45]. Outbreaks of NoV GE are distributed worldwide and year-round, although as its old name \u201cwinter vomiting disease\u201d implies, there are more outbreaks during the winter season of the year [46]. It was suggested that this seasonality is due to climatic conditions that promote a closer person-to-person contact and favor the survival of the viruses [47]. Further studies demonstrated that various NoV strains have different seasonal outbreak periodicities as GII strains mostly occur in winter, while GI viruses are more evenly spread over the year [48\u201350].",

Recent studies indicate a possible genetic basis of susceptibility to NoV infection. For example, susceptibility in a human population is found to be associated with an individual\u2019s ABH histo-blood type, mucosal cell-expressed carbohydrates, secretor status, and strain binding preferences of histo-blood group antigen (HBGA) receptors [26, 51\u201355]. Furthermore, P2s of different viral genotypes have been found to have specific affinity for certain ABO HBGA, with GI NoVs preferentially binding to group antigens A and O, and GII to group antigens A and B [56, 57]. Consequently, it is suggested that HBGA may serve as putative receptors for NoVs [54, 55, 58\u201360]. These findings may help to explain the phenomena of \u201casymptomatic infections\u201d in certain individuals who develop NoV-specific antibody response and shed virus, but do not display any typical symptoms of disease after NV infection [52]. In addition to acute GE, chronic NoV infection has also been documented in immunocompromised patients [61, 62].",

However, a study by Asanaka and colleagues has demonstrated that an expressed NV genomic RNA has the ability to replicate, to be transcribed into NV subgenomic RNA, and subsequently translated into VP1 in mammalian cells [63]. Moreover, the expression of VP1 was found to generate virus particles filled with NV genomic RNA in this particular cell [63]. These results clearly demonstrate the ability of mammalian cells in supporting the replication of NoV genomic RNA and the assembly of viral RNA into virus particles. Thus, the failure of NoV replication in mammalian cell cultures is not due to the lack of host factors to support intracellular expression of NoV RNA. Instead, the problem may lie in the steps of viral binding to cellular receptors, virus entry into cells after receptor binding, or uncoating of virus particles for releasing genomic RNA into the cytoplasm.",

The molecular and cellular mechanism of how diarrhea and vomiting are induced by NoV has not been fully revealed. Furthermore, the target cell(s) for human NoVs has yet to be conclusively identified. However, it has been observed that NoV starts to multiply within the small intestine upon infection and cause histopathologic lesions in the jejunum and reversible broadening and blunting of the jejunal villi in both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals [64]. Moreover, cytoplasmic vacuolization and infiltration with a unique CD8+ lymphocyte population in the epithelium have also been observed [65, 66]. It is speculated that these changes may be involved in the blunting of the villi. While it is still not possible to visualize NoV particles in biopsies from challenge studies, in vitro binding experiments suggested that viral binding occurs mostly at the villi level [67].",

Furthermore, the shear frequency and scale of NoV outbreaks have become a major burden on the health-care system and caused tremendous economic loss in the developed world [45]. Since the emergence of a new NoV variant GII.4 in 2002, the number of outbreaks has increased significantly, and large epidemics have occurred worldwide almost every 2 years [71, 72]. As a result, NoVs have been considered as emerging pathogens. Furthermore, because of the recent realization of their prominence in causing GE and their potential of causing rapid and large water-, food-, and possibly airborne outbreaks with as few as 10\u2013100 viral particles, NoVs have been also classified as class B biodefense pathogens [73].

Consequently, they are usually the method of choice in situations where large numbers of specimens are required to be screened rapidly and economically. Studies have shown that NoV antigen-detecting ELISAs have high specificity (94\u201396 %) but poor sensitivity (40\u201360 %), most likely due to the antigenic diversity of NoV strains [4, 79]. As a result, they are useful for specific detection of certain NoVs, but not sensitive enough for applications where a detection of a broad spectrum of NoVs is desired. The employment of pooled antibodies against multiple antigens or multivalent antibodies against a wider range of recombinant viral antigens has, however, improved the sensitivity of ELISAs [80].",

Similar to ELISA-based assays, RT-PCR is rapid and robust, because it can process large numbers of samples simultaneously and results can be obtained within a working day. However, it requires RNA extraction from fecal samples and needs expensive equipment and skilled workers to operate. Therefore, RT-PCR is more labor intensive and less economical than ELISAs. Using primer pairs designed for either highly conserved regions or strain-specific regions of the genome, RT-PCRs are versatile and offer both high specificity comparable to ELISAs and much higher sensitivity. The high sensitivity of this assay allows the detection of NoV in samples in which the concentration of virus is too low to be detected by other methods. These include clinical specimens with low viral load and environmental samples such as food and water [83].",

On the other hand, the high sensitivity of the assay may produce false-positive results from nonspecific amplification or potential sample cross-contamination. This challenge has been addressed by designing more specific primers to avoid amplification of nonspecific RNAs and by implementing more stringent procedures to prevent cross-contamination of samples. Due to the extraordinary sequence diversity among viruses in this genus, there is no single universal primer pair that can detect all strains of NoV. However, several primer pairs have been developed that can detect more than 90 % of all strains in GI and GII [85]. The robustness of RT-PCR-based diagnostic methods is being further optimized by employing faster and more sensitive assays such as real-time quantitative RT-PCR, which aims to rapidly detect even low copy number NoV in a large number of stool samples during outbreaks [86]. These studies demonstrated that TaqMan based real-time PCR offers more sensitive real-time diagnosis of NoV in both sporadic cases and the outbreak setting, and its results are easy to interpret and available within the working day [87].",

It is also crucial to remember that the heterogeneous and complex nature of stool samples and their storage conditions may often cause changes in the integrity of virus particles and/or RNA and consequently affect their reactivity in enzymatic and immunological assays. For example, the low sensitivity of ELISA-based methods will result in a significant number of false-negative samples if they are used as the only diagnostic method for clinical samples. Instead, they should be used only as \u201cscreening\u201d assays for clinical diagnosis to take advantage of their speed and availability to be performed at a location close to the patient.

Fortunately, the discovery of the spontaneous assembly of expressed VP1 into virus-like particles (VLPs) that are morphologically and antigenically similar to the native viruses has facilitated vaccine development [73]. VLPs combine the best traits of whole-virus and subunit antigens for vaccine development. VLPs are noninfectious, therefore, safer than inactivated or attenuated virus due to the lack of viral nucleic acid genome. At least in theory, the immunogenicity of VLPs can even be enhanced over that of the native virus by excluding immunosuppressive viral proteins in their composition. Moreover, an inactivation process is unnecessary for VLP production. Consequently, no unintended epitope modification would occur, further ensuring the VLP\u2019s immunogenicity. Importantly, VLPs can induce potent cellular and humoral immune responses without adjuvants and are more effective vaccines than other subunit antigens because their architectures mimic infectious viruses. VLPs can be produced by recombinant technology in heterologous expression systems without requiring the ability to support viral replication [31]. This is particularly important for NoV because no such culture system has been developed to support the growth of these viruses [96].",

Studies have demonstrated that viruses and corresponding VLPs have a particle size ideal for DC and macrophage uptake to initiate antigen processing [98, 99].

In general, oral delivery of subunit protein vaccines for gut immunity may not be effective due to the possibility of denaturation and degradation of antigens by stomach acid and digestion enzymes, poor transport to the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) for antigen processing and presentation, and potential stimulation of systemic immune tolerance [102]. However, VLPs\u2019 compact and highly ordered structures allow them to be more resistant to degradative enzymes in the digestive tract than other protein vaccines. The resemblance of VLPs to authentic viral particles may also present a \u201cdanger signal\u201d that overcomes the perception of gut antigens as benign and thus prevents the development of immune tolerance [55]. Both of these characteristics are especially true for VLPs of NoV because their cognate viruses are natural gastrointestinal pathogens. Moreover, they are also naturally recognized and efficiently transported into GALT [4]. Thus, the challenges of oral vaccine delivery can be potentially overcome by the unique structure of VLPs that allow them to elicit a potent gut immune response.",

Moreover, mice in the 200 \u03bcg dosage group developed NV-specific intestinal IgA in a level up to 0.1 % of total IgA. Inclusion of the mucosal adjuvant cholera toxin (CT) did not significantly change the number of positive responders of serum IgG or intestinal IgA, but significantly enhanced the amplitude of serum IgG response, especially for higher doses of VLPs [106].

These findings clearly demonstrated the ability of insect cell-derived NVCP VLPs in eliciting systemic and mucosal B-cell responses to potentially neutralize NV and inhibit its infection and also suggest their application as carriers of heterologous epitopes to combat sexually transmitted infections (STI).

These VEE VRPs can infect mammalian cells and accumulate large amounts of vaccine proteins [116].

In addition, the recombinant VRPs can be used as vaccines themselves to produce VLPs in vivo. Therefore, this system can be used in two ways to induce immunity and potentially be advantageous, as VRPs can be directly used to infect permissive mammalian host target cells in which a large quantity of NVCP VLPs are assembled for antigen presentation to B and T cells [117]. For example, direct subcutaneous inoculation of two doses (10 [7] infectious units per dose) of recombinant NVCP-VRP through the footpads in mice elicited strong systemic IgG and intestinal IgA responses against NV VLP, as well as heterotypic responses to VLPs of another GI NoV [117]. Furthermore, the serum and intestinal immune responses in mice that were inoculated with two doses of NVCP-VRPs are substantially stronger than those in mice that were given two oral doses of either 75 or 200 \u03bcg of VEE-derived NVCP VLPs [117].",

As a result, the flexibility and capital efficiency for plant biomass generation and scale-up are far more superior to current fermentation-based technologies [128, 129]. In addition, plants possess eukaryotic processing machinery for proper posttranslational modification and assembly of proteins and have low risk of introducing adventitious pathogens to humans [124, 127]. Despite these potential advantages, earlier production of protein vaccines using stable transgenic plants resulted in slow and low levels of target protein accumulation [54, 126]. The long time frame (several months to a year) to generate transgenic plants, the lack of strong promoters and the position effects from the random insertion of the transgene are responsible for these problems that reduce the cost-saving benefit of plants as a production system [102].",

Thus, VLPs produced in edible plants represent a novel and cost-effective approach to establishing gut mucosal immunity by oral delivery [135\u2013137]. As a vaccine is required to have a defined dosage unit, this strategy may face regulatory hurdles for commercialization in developed countries [102, 123, 124].

However, assembled virion-sized icosahedral VLPs that resemble insect cell-derived VLPs or native NV particles were observed in transgenic tobacco leaves and in potato tubers [101]. In another experiment, the VP1 gene of NV was codon optimized and expressed in transgenic tomato plants [138]. Comparative studies indicated that VLP yield and assembly varied depending on the codon usage, host plant species, and possibly the target tissue of NVCP accumulation [101]. For instance, NVCP expression level was low, and only 25\u201350 % of them was assembled into VLP in potato tubers, while at least ten-fold higher expression and more efficient VLP assembly were achieved in tomato fruits [101].",

This immunization regime induced specific serum IgG and intestinal IgA responses in mice [101]. When four doses of 50 \u03bcg purified NVCP VLPs were orally delivered to mice in the same immunization regime, serum anti-NV response was four-fold higher than that of mice fed with NVCP-expressing-tuber [101]. The humoral immune response can be further enhanced to 16-fold higher when adjuvant (CT) was co-delivered [101]. Perhaps, the enrichment of assembled VLPs in the purified samples is responsible for the enhancement of humoral immunity because only ~50 % of the NVCP in the potato tubers was assembled into VLPs [31]. It is also possible that NVCP was not efficiently released from the potato tissue to be delivered to GALT for antigen processing and presentation.",

It was also noticed that ingestion of NVCP air-dried tomatoes elicited more potent serum IgG and intestinal IgA responses than that NVCP freeze-dried tomatoes [138]. It is possible that the freeze-drying process altered the assembly status of VLPs in tomato fruits. Alternatively, air-drying may result in better VLP stability by preserving the architecture of VLPs and the tissue structure so that VLPs are better protected from the digestive enzymes in the oral-gastrointestinal tract or more efficiently released from the tissue for uptake by GALT.

A master seed bank for wild-type N. benthamiana was also established. Our experiment has shown that this seed bank has a germination rate of 99 % and produced uniform seedlings with typical N. benthamiana morphology even after a 4-year storage at 4 \u00b1 2 \u00b0C (Fig. 8.3) [126]. These results collectively demonstrated that it is feasible to establish master and working banks of A. tumefaciens strains and N. benthamiana seeds that meet the qualification standards of identity and stability for cGMP production of NoV VLPs.\n\n",

Studies by our group and others demonstrated that temperature, light source and intensity, plant age, and incubation time after leaf infiltration all have significant impacts on biomass generation and VLP accumulation [126]. For example, N. benthamiana grown under nature light produces more biomass, but accumulates much less NVCP VLPs than plants grown under artificial light (Fig. 8.4a). Furthermore, leaves grown under natural-light also produce more solid debris during VLP extraction, causing problems for VLP purification [126]. Our data also indicate that a 16-h light/8-h dark cycle at 25 \u00b0C is the optimal condition to generate biomass under such artificial lighting [126]. When N. benthamiana plants were grown under these conditions and sampled at various ages for NVCP VLP expression, it was founded that 5-week-old plants provided the optimal material for VLP production, because they already accumulated an adequate amount of\nbiomass and produced the highest level of VLPs (Fig. 8.4b). Younger plants produce insufficient biomass, and older plants are too tall for infiltration and start to produce more secondary metabolites that complicate VLP purification. Consequently, 5-week-old N. benthamiana optimally balance the combined need for biomass generation, filtration operation, and VLP accumulation. Our data demonstrated that under these optimized conditions, biomass for producing sufficient amount of purified NVCP VLPs for a Phase I clinical trial can be generated in 5.6 square meters of green house space in a 5-week period [126]. The horizontal space requirements for this type of production could be significantly reduced by vertically stacking layers of growth trays vertically.",

Moreover, the yield and temporal expression pattern of NVCP VLPs under these scale-up conditions are similar to that of our previous smaller bench-scale experiments [126, 133].

Therefore, it is absolutely necessary to have a robust and scalable downstream process that can effectively recover and purify VLPs in place in order for plant-produced NoV VLP vaccines to become commercial reality.

The most common practice for NoV VLP purification is density gradient ultracentrifugation [106, 108, 133, 144]. While these methods are useful for characterizing VLP size and assembly [107, 133, 144], they are not practical for commercial VLP manufacturing as they are difficult to scale-up and time-consuming [143, 145]. They may also be problematic for preserving the integrity of VLPs because the hyperosmotic gradient agents and severe centrifugation force can often shear VLPs [146]. To meet the demand for more scalable and robust methods of NoV VLP processing, a new trend has started toward more sophisticated methods like filtration and chromatography [31]. For example, our group has recently developed a robust and scalable downstream processing scheme for recovering NVCP VLPs from plants (Fig. 8.5).\n\n",

As part of the efforts to overcome this challenge, our laboratory has identified and developed analytical assays to monitor the in-process samples and to ensure that the final VLP product meets preset specifications for the release of human pharmaceuticals in identity, purity, concentration, tertiary structure, functionality, and in concentrations of host contaminating molecules essential for the cGMP compliance (Table 8.2). Our analyses showed that the identity and assembly of the final VLP product were confirmed and its purity, concentration, appearance, residual host DNA concentration, and stability all conformed to the insect cell-derived reference standard [126]. The final VLP product elicited strong NVCP-specific systemic, local, and distal mucosal immune responses in mice, demonstrating its potency [126]. These results have provided the first example of plant-derived NoV VLPs from a scale-up process that meets the predetermined release specifications.\n",

However, the overall antibody response was not as strong as that obtained by orally delivered purified NVCP VLPs (250 \u03bcg per dose) produced in insect cells [144]. Perhaps, the variable effective VLP dosage due to inconsistent NVCP content and poor VLP assembly in potato tubers may cause this weak antigenicity. The potency of the plant-derived VLPs may also be further reduced by their poor release from the potato tissue in the gut lumen. In light of this and the results from recent human clinical trials with insect cell-derived VLPs, in the near future, we are planning a new human clinical trial with purified NVCP VLPs from our cGMP runs and the adjuvants defined in our current studies (see Quality control section above) [126].",

Since NoV naturally causes infection in the gastrointestinal tract, the VLPs are stable at low pH and resistant to digestive enzymes. As a result, they can be administered orally and elicit a potent mucosal antibody response and systemic response in mice and humans. For example, oral delivery of NVCP VLPs induced robust production of anti-NV serum and intestinal antibodies and interferon-\u03b3 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells [144].",

This problem is further intensified by the lack of culture systems to cultivate NoV in vitro and the lack of small animal models of NoV pathogenesis.

Furthermore, vigilant epidemiological surveillance must be coupled with NoV vaccine production to identify this moving target and to include the most prevalent circulating strains in the formulation for optimal protection. New data from ongoing and planned human clinical trials, particularly challenge trials, should shed new light on the efficacy of VLPs in preventing or limiting NoV infection in the next few years.
