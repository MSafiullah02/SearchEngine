The\nchapter begins with a discussion of the political economy of the emergence of SARS, and\nits relation to the spread of the virus.

Through analysis of the lack of social resources available to working people\nin the province and the prioritizing of corporate, particularly tourism industry,\nconcerns, the chapter examines how issues of class underpinned public responses to SARS,\nexacerbating problems. The chapter concludes by giving attention to the need for social\nsolidarity and community mutual aid in a context of emerging epidemics within capitalist\nglobalization and questions why diseases and illnesses impacting poor people have\nreceived less attention and fewer resources than those largely impacting members of the\nglobal tourist classes.",

Health care is considered a provincial responsibility but the majority of\nfunding is provided by the federal government through the national Medicare program. The\nfederal Liberal government has instituted, over three consecutive majority terms\nbeginning in 1993, a massive reduction of funding transfers to the provinces. Beginning\nin 1995 the federal government removed regulations covering health care transfers that\nhad previously ensured the funding went directly to health care. This move meant that\nmonies that had previously been earmarked specifically for health care could now be\nspent on any other area the provincial government deemed necessary. This left Ontario's\ngovernments free to apply $987 million in federal health transfer money to such areas as\nhydro cost overruns (Diebel, 2003, p. A8).\nPreviously such moves would have been met with a financial penalty and a future loss of\nfunds.

SARS, like the Walkerton tragedy before it,\nwhich saw several people die and hundreds become sick after privatization and cuts to\nwater inspection contributed to E. coli contamination of the town's\ndrinking water, revealed the extent of the damage done to the health care system in\nOntario by the Tories. When the Tories assumed power in 1995 under the leadership of\nEve's predecessor Mike Harris, they pursued a stated policy of creating a crisis in\npublic services in order to encourage privatization and cutbacks. Harris withdrew $1.3\nbillion from hospitals to underwrite a policy of tax cuts for the wealthy and\ncorporations (Diebel, 2003, p. A1). With regard\nto health care, Harris maintained that Ontario employed too many nurses and worked to\nreduce staffing levels by laying off thousands of nurses. Between 1995 and 1999, 25,000\nhospital positions were cut in Ontario (Diebel, 2003,\np. A8). In addition, much of nursing in the province was casualized with 50% of\nnurses working part-time, often holding down two or three jobs at separate hospitals.\nOnly 18 months prior to the SARS outbreak the government fired five leading laboratory\nscientists who worked with a Toronto reference laboratory unit that monitored coming\ninfections and new disease threats. \u2018Hospitals and public health units across Ontario\nrelied on their work\u2019 (Toronto Star, 2003b, p.\nA9).",

A8).

This has long been a central theme\nof the alternative globalization movements that have emerged to mobilize for a\nglobalization of social justice, fairness and equality rather than a globalization of\n\u2018free trade\u2019, markets and economic exploitation. Solidarity means working on the basis\nof mutual aid and support with others who are less powerful, wealthy or healthy (Singer, 2007). A key challenge of the global era is\nto understand and address the complex interconnections between globalization and health\nand to develop ways to overcome global health inequalities in different regions (Singer, 2007). Some of the instability and indeed\ntrauma of globalization might be lessened through the nurturing of a global health ethic\nof solidarity. Health impacts are felt far more severely and do greater damage in poor,\nrural areas, but diseases can spread to wealthier, urban areas, as SARS showed, so those\nin wealthier centers have a self-interested, rather than purely compassionate, reason\nfor developing an ethic of solidarity in dealing with health issues. Health, in\nprivileged nations, is linked with health, or the lack of health, in poorer nations,\nespecially as distinctions between domestic and foreign policy become blurred in the\nglobal age (Singer, 2007). Addressing this\nwill, of course, require significant socio-political shifts.",

One example might include citizen fora and community panels, and\ntransnational community organizations which bring together grassroots community members\nto share information and resources. This would involve the participation of health care\nworkers but also unionists and workers in relevant industries such as food production,\nbringing people together across borders to share ideas and material resources that might\nallow for a restructuring of work and subsistence such that the causal conditions behind\nmajor outbreaks are avoided or lessened. It is not coincidental that SARS and, more\nrecently, H1N1 have roots in farming practices within conditions of poverty and\ninsufficient resources. Other example would include the inclusion of health care workers\nand their union representatives within community policy panels.",
