The 1a replicase from BMV is a membrane protein of unknown structure with a methyltransferase N-terminal domain and a putative helicase activity in the C-terminal domain. In order to make a functional prediction of the helicase activity of the BMV 1a C-terminal domain, we have built a model of its structure. The use of fold recognition servers hinted at two different superfamilies of helicases [superfamily 1 (SF1) and superfamily 2 (SF2)] as putative templates for the C-terminal fragment of BMV 1a. A structural model of BMV 1a in SF2 was obtained by means of a fold recognition server (3D-PSSM). On the other hand, we used the helicase motifs described in the literature to construct a model of the structure of the BMV 1a Cterminal domain as a member of the SF1. The biological functionality and statistic potentials were used to discriminate between the two models. The results illustrate that the use of sequence profiles and patterns helps modeling. Accordingly, the C-terminal domain of BMV 1a is a potential member of the SF1 of helicases, and it can be modeled with the structure of a member of the UvrD family of helicases. The helicase mechanism was corroborated by the model and this supports the hypothesis that BMV 1a should have helicase activity.",

Although helicases form a wide and diverse group of proteins, they all share common sequence patterns, the so-called \"helicase motifs\". These motifs consist of short conserved amino acids that play a key role in diverse steps of the helicase activity. Based on these motifs, helicases have been classified into five main groups [2] (see Fig. 1 ). The majority Fig. 1 Scheme of the main groups of helicases (adapted from Gorbalenya and Koonin [2] ). The distinct groups of helicases within the large families are represented by the small circles inside the larger circles.

To study their replication, the Brome mosaic virus (BMV), a member of the alphavirus-like superfamily of plant, animal and human viruses, has been proven to be a useful model system [7] . Two viral proteins are sufficient for BMV replication, the polymerase 2a and the replicase 1a. The latter protein has an N-terminal m 7 G methyltransferase and a covalent GTP-binding activity necessary for capping of the three viral RNAs. The C-terminal half contains a helicase-like domain that was shown to be essential for BMV RNA synthesis.

The protein sequences of these databases were formatted into BLAST format [10] and Psi-Blast [10, 11] was used to search homologous sequences of the target protein. Also, the Pfam-A database [12] of protein profiles was downloaded for searching homologous sequences by means of Hidden Markov Models with the program HMMER [13] . The databases of motifs PROSITE [14] and PRINTS [15] were used on the web for searching local motifs. The alignments between the target protein and the templates were obtained by means of fold recognition using 3D-PSSM [16] and FUGUE [17] . Several partial models of the structure of the target sequence were obtained by distance restraints (extracted from the alignment) with the program MODELLER [18, 19] and energy minimized with GROMOS [20] . Statistical energies per residue were calculated with ProsaII [21] for all models and were used to validate their conformations. Finally, the protein models complexed with DNA were obtained by superimposition with STAMP [22] on the structure of the DNA-helicase complex of PcrA with DNA (PDB code 3pjr).

The results with FUGUE were discarded because the Z-score was less than marginal; the best score was 4.68 and it was given to gluconate kinase, while UvrD-helicase ranked on the 8th position with a Z-score of 2.33 and a wrong alignment at the ATP binding site motif. According to 3D-PSSM results, then, the model for the Ct domain of BMV can be obtained either as a member of the DEAD and DEAH box helicase family (SF2 helicases) or as a member of the UvrD-helicases family (SF1 helicases). For a model of the Ct domain as a member of the DEAD/H box helicase family we should use the known structure of MjDEAD, with PDB code 1hv8, or the structure of the Hepatitis C virus NS3 (HCV-NS3), with PDB code 1a1v. On the other hand, the modeling as a member of the UvrD-helicases family should be done with the structure of PcrA, with PDB codes 1pjr and 3pjr, or the structure of RepA, with PDB code 1uaa.",

This alignment was obtained manually by forcing the first five helicase motifs on BMV 1a to coincide with those of PcrA (see Fig. 3b ), using the alignment of the SF2 model as a basis. The steps followed in this process were: (1) we obtained a structural alignment between the structures of SF2 (MjDEAD) and SF1 (PcrA) with the program STAMP; (2) to obtain the alignment between PcrA and BMV 1a we combined the MjDEAD-PcrA alignment with the one previously used in the SF2 model (MjDEAD-BMV 1a) using the common aligned residues; and (3) we manually rearranged the sequence to align the SF1 helicase motifs described for PcrA with those expected in BMV 1a, [3] while maintaining the alignment from step 2 in the zones that did not include these motifs.

Except for motifs III and IV, which differ in sequence, function and relative position, the rest of the motifs have strong similarities between the two superfamilies. It has been reported that in the SF1 of helicases, the motifs I, II, III and IV are responsible for ATP (or another NTP) binding and hydrolysis, while motifs Ia, III and V interact with the nucleic-acid substrate. Motif VI would connect these two groups, transferring the energy from the ATPase activity to the helicase activity. In the SF2 helicases, the ATPase activity depends on motifs I, II and VI, while interaction with the nucleic-acid substrate depends on motifs Ia, IV and V. Motif III would be the connector in these helicases [3] . Fig. 4 Secondary structures of the models of BMV 1a. The sequence of the C-terminal fragment of BMV 1a used for model building is aligned with its secondary structure prediction obtained with psi-pred [30] and with the secondary structures obtained by means of DSSP for the SF1 model, SF-2 preliminary and SF2 model (code E is used for b-strand, H for helix and C for coil). Regions forced into helical conformation in the SF-2 model are underlined and hinted in red. We analyzed the presence of these motifs in the models obtained from the structures of helicases of SF1 and SF2 by checking their sequence, as well as their ability to perform a biological function (see Fig. 6 ). In order to emphasize the helicase function of the C-terminal domain of BMV 1a, we also modeled the interaction with DNA. The model should show an interaction with RNA. As, however, the homology with any of the available structures of helicases complexed with RNA was not good enough to allow the proper superimposition of protein structures, we sustain the model of docking with DNA as the most reliable approach. The partial model of BMV in complex with DNA was obtained by superim-position of the model and the structure of the member of the SF1, taken from the PDB with code 3pjr, which includes the binding with DNA. The protein part of 3pjr was removed from the superimposition, while DNA remained docked with the model of BMV 1a. The docking of DNA and BMV1a was adjusted manually with Turbo-Frodo [32] and the side chains were refined energetically with GROMOS. Moreover, using a similar procedure, ATP was also added to the SF1 model, while for the SF2 model this was not possible because of the disposition of the residues and their side chains in the putative ATP binding site.

Also, the confidence degree of the 3D-PSSM server and the scores obtained by FUGUE for the C-terminal domain of BMV 1a, stated that this was a helicase. Nevertheless, the recognition as a member of the SF1 or SF2 remained unclear, and the alignment with a template sequence of known structure was either insufficient or uncertain.

The final assessment of the structure of the modeled fragment was obtained by statistical pseudo-potentials. The pseudo-energies calculated with ProsaII were used to obtain some clues for the identification of BMV 1a and its functional annotation as helicase. Furthermore, these energies were used for the validation of the models (both SF1 and SF2). The energy between pairs of residues resulted positive for the SF2 model while for the SF1 model it was mostly negative. However, this energy was not as negative as for the crystallographic structures of PcrA (as member of SF1 helicases) and the structure of MjDEAD (as member of SF2 helicases). Also, the putative interactions with ATP and DNA were better arranged for the SF1 model. The model building of a partial region of the C-terminal fragment of BMV 1a, containing five helicase motifs of the SF1, and the correct interaction of these residues with a polymer of nucleic and an ATP molecule, reinforced the assumption of BMV 1a being a member of the SF1 of helicases.",

These final arrangements can be obtained by using sequence patterns or local profiles containing the functional and structural correlation. In this particular example, most coincidences concluded that the most likely structure of the C-terminal fragment of BMV 1a was the SF1 model. While threading methods concluded that this fragment was a member of the \"P-loop containing nucleotide triphosphate hydrolase\" fold and probably a member of SF2 helicases, we needed additional manual intervention to construct the model as a member of SF1 helicases. Therefore, although we can not claim a unique answer to the 3D conformation of the C-terminal domain of BMV 1a, the energetic and sequence trends proved the conclusion that the C-tail of BMV 1a was likely a member of the SF1 helicases with a conformation similar to the structure of PcrA. First, this example would answer the main question about the function and structure of the C-terminal fragment of BMV 1a. However, in addition, this example would also confirm the use of functional sequence patterns and scientific intuition to obtain a sensible answer on the deepest knowledge and more detailed description of the biological function and conformation of a protein. Answering the possibility of the helicase mechanism as a member of the SF1 helicases also supports the original hypothesis that BMV 1a should have helicase activity. Further experiments should be performed to corroborate the hypothesis. Nevertheless our results clearly hint at this direction.",
