The pandemic has reverberated across economies and financial markets. Not only did it impact severely the global economy and financial markets, but it also triggered a series of unprecedented government interventions. 2 The policy responses such as workplace closings or limiting residential movement helped to curb the spread of infections, but also had a dramatic economic impact. Whereas the earlier literature concentrated predominantly on the role of non-pharmaceutical interventions on the economy, their impact on the global financial markets remains essentially unexplored. This article aims at filling this gap, at least partially, by focusing on one important feature on international stock markets: volatility.",

The finance literature has long established a link between crises, government interventions, and policy uncertainty and financial market volatility. 3 Several attempts have been also taken to test the relationship between the recent coronavirus crisis and market volatility (Albulescu 2020; Baker et al. 2020; Lopatta et al. 2020; Onali 2020) . Nonetheless, to the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to investigate to what extent the social restrictions imposed by various governments around the world affect the stock market volatility.",

            "text": "The government policy responses to COVID-19 may affect stock market volatility through two possible principal channels. The first \"rational\" channel is related to portfolio restructuring. The interventions signal changes in future economic conditions, so they may affect changes that affect company cash-flow expectations and, in consequence, stock prices. Abrupt portfolio reconstructions-both within an asset class and across asset classes-may elevate the volatility. The second \"irrational\" channel could be rather of behavioural nature. The deterioration in the economic environment may result in \"flights to safety\" (Baele et al. 2020) , leading to rapid portfolio flows and price changes. Also, the constant flow of policy-related news may lead to news-implied volatility (Manela and Moreira 2017) and a potential divergence of opinions 1 Data was retrieved from https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/ on 28 April 2020. 2 See, e.g., Al-Awadhi et al.

For robustness, we employ five different measures tracking day-to-day changes in volatility (for similar approach, see, e.g., Antonakakis and Kizys 2015; Khalifa et al. 2011, inter alia) . The first measure, log|R|, is the logarithm of absolute return. The logarithmic transformation ensures that the volatility measure in levels is positive definite. It also accounts for the fact that the relationship between the level of volatility and its covariates is not necessarily linear. The remaining measures are logarithms of absolute residual returns from four different asset pricing models: the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) by Sharpe (1964) , the Fama-French (1993) three-factor model (FF), the Asness, Moskowitz, and Pedersen (2013) three-factor model (s AMP), and the Carhart (1997) four-factor model (CAR).

(2020) , who show that COVID-19-related information campaigns may motivate investors to restructure their portfolio positions, facilitating additional trading in the market. The second type of intervention refers to cancellations of public events. While the economic impact of this intervention is more constrained than in the case of, e.g., workplace closures, it is regarded as an introductory measure within the government's policy toolbox, and thus it is timed before other measures by the government. Thus, consistently with a signaling mechanism, an initial government response-which consists of cancelling public events-can be perceived by financial investors as a negative signal for further interventions, and it can be interpreted as a precursor of economic and financial instabilities across the globe. This initial response gives investors the first opportunity to react to the forthcoming changes in economic interventions. As a result, volatility remains at a higher level as long as investors anticipate more stringent government interventions in the future. Hence, the effects of both types of significant interventions-information campaigns and public event cancellations-seem logical and intuitive from the theoretical perspective. 10",

The independent variables are: the Government Policy Response Stringency Index (SI), the logarithm of daily dollar trading volume expressed in USD (log(TV)), the logarithm of market value in USD (log(MV)), the logarithm of market-wide PE ratio (log(PE)), and daily changes in numbers of new COVID-19 infections and deaths (\u0394INF, \u0394DTH); ShortBan indicates short-selling ban, and ShortNote indicates a requirement to notify large short position to a local market regulator. All the regression equations include also weekday dummies. R 2 denotes an adjusted coefficient of determination. The numbers in brackets are t-statistics and asterisks *, **, and *** denote statistical significance at the 5%, 1%, and 0.1% levels, respectively. Panel A demonstrates the baseline results following the random-effects model, while Panel B displays robustness checks assuming several alternative specifications or functional forms: fixed-effects and pooled regression models, a regression equation excluding the weekday dummies, and a regression equation controlling for the total number of deaths and cases.
