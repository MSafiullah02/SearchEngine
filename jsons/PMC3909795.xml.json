            "text": "Dictyostelia are soil\u2010dwelling protists that exist both as unicellular predators and as gregarious community members. They start life as amoebas that feed on bacteria in decaying vegetation. Lack of food triggers social behavior and the amoebas move together to form a colony that proceeds to build a fruiting structure. Here the best fed amoebas enter a dormant spore stage and the rest construct a pedestal to bear the spore mass aloft. Over a hundred species of Dictyostelia have currently been identified, but research has mostly been focused on the model species Dictyostelium discoideum. This is largely a consequence of the fact that this species uses the well\u2010known intracellular messenger cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) as a secreted signal to coordinate the aggregation process (Konijn et al. 1967).",

            "text": "In addition to forming fruiting bodies, many species can encyst individually when starved and form dormant microcysts (Raper 1984; Kessin 2001). Microcysts are less dehydrated than spores and have a thinner two\u2010layered cell wall instead of the thick three\u2010layered spore coat (Hohl et al. 1970). This process of encystation in response to stress is used by most if not all amoebozoan ancestors of the Dictyostelia and is also common among other unicellular protists (Eichinger 2001). Alternatively, Dictyostelia can form sexual macrocysts (Urushihara & Muramoto 2006). This often requires the presence of cells with opposite mating types, although homothallic mating also occurs. Macrocyst formation begins when two cells fuse to form a zygote. The zygote then chemotactically attracts other starving cells and cannibalizes them in order to synthesize a highly resistant thick cell wall, whereupon the cyst enters a long period of dormancy. More information on the sexual cycle and the recent identification of the Dictyostelium mating type loci (Bloomfield et al. 2010) can be found in Chapter 15 of this issue. The formation of zygotic cysts or zygospores is also fairly common, occurring for example, in some fungi (Valle & Santamaria 2005) and in the Volvocales (Gilbert 2006). However, the cannibalistic embellishment appears thus far to be unique for the Dictyostelia. In Dictyostelia, macrocysts and microcysts are more usually formed under dark and wet conditions that are not favorable for fruiting body formation, which requires an air\u2010water interface (Raper 1984; Kessin 2001).",

However, it is now clear that this morphology\u2010based classification does not reflect the genetic relationships between different groups. Until about 15 years ago, all amoeba\u2010like protists that formed a spore\u2010bearing structure were classified as Myxomycota, placed in the kingdom Fungi. The Myxomycota were subdivided into the Protostelids with fruiting structures of one to four cells, the true slime molds or Myxogastrids that form fruiting bodies from a multinucleate syncytium, and the Acrasiomycetes that form fruiting bodies from cell aggregates. The Dictyostelia were placed as a subclass of the Acrasiomycetes, and subdivided into three genera: Dictyostelium with simple or branched cellular stalks, Acytostelium with acellular stalks, and Polysphondylium with regular whorls of side branches. The other subclass of Acrasiomycetes \u2013 the Acrasids \u2013 differs from the Dictyostelids in the morphology of its amoebas and aggregates, and the lack of cellulose in spore\u2010bearing structures (Raper 1984).",

Most importantly, most Acrasiomycetes are members of the unrelated supergroup Discicristates, but one species, Fonticula alba is a member of the Opisthokonts (Brown et al. 2009). The Protostelia are polyphyletic and emerged several times independently across the Amoebozoa (Shadwick et al. 2009). The Dictyostelia are monophyletic and are subdivided into four major groups (Fig. 1), which, in order of divergence from their last common ancestor, are called the Parvisporids (group 1), Heterostelids (group 2), Rhizostelids (group 3) and Dictyostelids (group 4). None of these groups correspond to the three traditional genera. In fact, group 2, the Heterostelids, includes members of all three (Dictyostelium, Polysphondylium, and Acytostelium). Evidently, similarity of fruiting body morphology is not a good marker for genetic similarity.",

As a secreted signal, cAMP controls cell movement and differentiation throughout the developmental program, but in its more common role as intracellular messenger, it mediates the effect of many other developmental signals. The main intracellular target for cAMP is cAMP\u2010dependent protein kinase or PKA, which similar to fungal PKAs, consist of a single regulatory (PKA\u2010R) and a single catalytic subunit (PKA\u2010C; Mutzel et al. 1987). During canonical PKA activation, cAMP binds to PKA\u2010R, which causes PKA\u2010R to dissociate from PKA\u2010C, leaving PKA\u2010C in its active form. However, because PKA\u2010C is active on its own, the ratio of inhibitory PKA\u2010R to active PKA\u2010C molecules is also an important determinant for PKA\u2010C activity.",

PKA activity is not required for growth, but it is essential for the transition from growth to aggregation (Simon et al. 1989). In feeding cells, PKA\u2010C translation is inhibited by binding of the translational repressor PufA to the 3\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) of PKA\u2010C mRNA (Souza et al. 1999). Upon starvation, this repression is relieved by YakA, a member of a deeply conserved protein kinase family that also regulates the decision between growth and differentiation in animals and fungi (Hartley et al. 1994; Souza et al. 1998; Mercer & Friedman 2006). Once synthesized, PKA\u2010C activates full expression of early genes such as discoidin I, and a basal level of expression of genes that are required for aggregation, such as the cAMP receptor cAR1, the extracellular cAMP phosphodiesterase PdsA, and the adenylate cyclase ACA (Schulkes & Schaap 1995).",

However, the prespore cells become less sensitive to cAMP pulses, which causes the prestalk cells to move selectively to the oscillating tip and take up an anterior position in the emerging slug (Matsukuma & Durston 1979; Traynor et al. 1992). During fruiting body formation, the prestalk cells first lay down a central cellulose tube. They then crawl into the tube and differentiate into stalk cells. This differentiation process involves massive vacuolization of the cells and construction of a cellulose cell wall (Raper & Fennell 1952). The prespore cells have meanwhile synthesized the first layer of the spore wall and further spore wall precursors in Golgi\u2010derived prespore vesicles. They climb up the newly formed stalk and initiate spore formation by rapid fusion of the prespore vesicles with the plasma membrane (West 2003).",

This normally occurs in response to incident light and allows loss of ammonia from the tip by gaseous diffusion. Ammonia is the end\u2010product of protein degradation in the starving cells and acts as a signal to block both initiation of fruiting body formation and the maturation of stalk cells (Schindler & Sussman 1977; Wang & Schaap 1989). Both processes are dependent on PKA activity (Harwood et al. 1992; Hopper et al. 1993b), and ammonia indirectly inhibits PKA by promoting cAMP hydrolysis. Ammonia is one of several signals that regulate the activity of sensor histidine kinases/phosphatases, which, upon ligand binding initiate either forward or reverse phosphoryltransfer that ultimately leads to phosphorylation or dephosphorylation of a conserved aspartate in the response regulator of the intracellular cAMP phosphodiesterase RegA (Shaulsky et al. 1998; Thomason et al. 1998). Ammonia activates forward phosphoryl transfer by acting on the histidine kinase DhkC, resulting in RegA activation, hydrolysis of cAMP and inhibition of PKA (Singleton et al. 1998). Loss of ammonia from the tip therefore allows PKA activation and stalk maturation at this position.",

GABA has two effects: it triggers the secretion of Acyl\u2010CoA binding protein (AcbA) from prespore cells, and it causes exposure of the TagC serine protease at the surface of prestalk cells. TagC cleaves secreted AcbA to form SDF\u20102 (Anjard & Loomis 2005, 2006; Cabral et al. 2006), which in turn activates the histidine phosphatase DhkA of prespore cells, leading to dephosphorylation, and thereby inactivation of RegA. The resulting increase in intracellular cAMP then causes PKA activation and spore maturation (Wang et al. 1999). In addition to this cascade, two other signals are required for spores to mature: (i) the secreted peptide SDF\u20101, which promotes cAMP production by ACG leading to PKA activation; and (ii) the cytokinin discadenine, which acts on the histidine kinase DhkB and ACR to upregulate PKA (Anjard & Loomis 2008).",

In D. discoideum, cAR1 is expressed from separate early and late promoters during aggregation and post\u2010aggregative development, respectively, (Louis et al. 1993) and car1 null mutants lose the ability to produce cAMP pulses and to aggregate and form fruiting bodies (Sun & Devreotes 1991). D. minutum uses folic acid instead of cAMP for aggregation (De Wit & Konijn 1983). Nevertheless, its cAR gene fully restores cAMP binding, oscillatory cAMP signaling, aggregation and fruiting body formation of a D. discoideum car1 null mutant, indicating that the D. minutum cAR is functionally identical to D. discoideum cAR1 (Alvarez\u2010Curto et al. 2005).",

Both spore formation and encystation require intracellular cAMP acting on PKA, but spore formation also requires extracellular cAMP acting on cARs. Because this pathway is no longer present in the P. pallidum cAR null mutant, the cells revert to encystation. This confirms that spore formation is evolutionarily derived from encystation and points to what might be the most ancestral role for secreted cAMP. The Dictyostelid ancestor already used intracellular cAMP to mediate stress\u2010induced encystation. Dictyostelids secrete most of the cAMP that they produce and accumulation of cAMP in aggregates may have acted to inform cells of their aggregated state and cause them to form spores and not cysts. Such a mechanism provides a rationale for the observation that prespore induction requires much higher (micromolar) cAMP concentrations (Schaap & Van Driel 1985; Oyama & Blumberg 1986) than chemotaxis and cAMP relay (0.1\u201330 nmol/L) that take place before cells have collected in aggregates (Van Haastert & Konijn 1982). cAMP can only accumulate to micromolar concentrations between the closely packed aggregated cells.",

            "text": "We can now tentatively reconstruct how cAMP signaling evolved in the Dictyostelia and understand why cAMP has so many different roles in this organism (Fig. 3). It appears that cAMP acting on PKA triggers encystation not only in the Dictyostelia but also in the distantly related solitary amoebozoa Hartmannella culbertsoni and Entamoeba invadens (Raizada & Murti 1972; Coppi et al. 2002), while osmolyte\u2010induced encystation was observed in Acanthamoeba castellani and Hartmannella rhysodes (Band 1963; Cordingley et al. 1996). Although these phenomena have not been causally linked before, they very likely indicate that cAMP and PKA are universal intermediates for osmolyte\u2010induced encystation in amoebozoa. Basal dictyostelids do not use cAMP to aggregate, and the first colonial amoebas may have adapted their food\u2010seeking strategy for aggregation, while still using cAMP intracellularly to trigger encystation. Our data suggest that accumulation of passively secreted cAMP in aggregates was probably used next as a signal to prompt the starving cells to form spores and not cysts. Oscillatory cAMP signaling would likely have evolved later, firstly to coordinate cell movement in the aggregated cell masses, thus allowing the amoebas to form well\u2010structured fruiting bodies, and finally to coordinate the aggregation process in the most recently diverged group 4 (Kawabe et al. 2009). The three genes, ACA, cAR1 and PdsA that are absolutely essential for oscillatory cAMP production (Kriebel & Parent 2004) all have multiple promoters. In all three, the promoter that directs expression after aggregation is closest to the coding sequence, whereas the promoter that directs expression before and during aggregation is at a more distal location (Faure et al. 1990; Louis et al. 1993; Alvarez\u2010Curto et al. 2005; Galardi\u2010Castilla et al. 2010). This suggests that the novel role for cAMP as the chemoattractant that mediates aggregation in group 4 was achieved by adding distal promoters to the existing cAMP signaling genes.",

            "text": "The complexity and apparent redundancy of the signaling networks that control the development and other functions of multicellular organisms can often appear entirely baffling. In D. discoideum, one set of pathways that is well characterized is that controlling the chemotactic response. At the latest count, there were four different, but interlinked pathways, that translate an extracellular cAMP gradient into directional cell polarization (Veltman et al. 2008). Another set, outlined in this review, are the pathways that control spore maturation and germination. These processes involve a broad spectrum of signals, ranging from solute stress, a catabolite, steroid, and cytokinin to a neurotransmitter and a neuropeptide, detected by a variety of receptors ranging from a sensor\u2010linked adenylate cyclase to G\u2010protein coupled receptors and sensor\u2010linked histidine kinases. Quite remarkably, all of these signals ultimately act to regulate one event: the activation of PKA by cAMP. As I hope to have demonstrated in this review, the evolutionary reconstruction of signaling pathways reveals why this is the case; cAMP activation of PKA originally mediated stress\u2010induced encapsulation of the unicellular ancestor. Interestingly, PKA activation not only triggers encapsulation of the viable spores, but also of the stalk cells, suggesting that the stalk pathway is also derived from the encystation pathway. This is somewhat evident from the fact that the two\u2010layered microcyst cell wall resembles the two\u2010layered stalk cell wall more closely than the three\u2010layered spore wall (Kawabe et al. 2009), but requires information about shared gene products for further confirmation. The origin of the third encysted cell type, the macrocyst, is still unclear. Kessin (2001) argues that the relatively simple developmental program of the macrocysts indicates that they evolved before fruiting bodies. However, analysis of character evolution in the Dictyostelia showed that the apparent complexity of morphological characters can be a poor indicator of the order and timing of their emergence (Schaap et al. 2006). In the absence of ancestral taxa that form macrocysts, but not fruiting bodies, any statement about their evolutionary origin remains speculative.",

Because the increased fruiting body size in group 4 taxa is a consequence of the fact that they form only a single dominant oscillating tip on their aggregate, causality between earlier use of oscillatory cAMP signaling and size is not impossible to envisage. However, how and why this should be linked to loss of microcysts and spore granules is as yet obscure.",

The Parvisporids take their name from the fact that their spores are smaller than those in the other groups. These spores carry clusters of consolidated granules at their poles, a feature that is also common to the larger spores of the group 3 Rhizostelids. The genus Acytostelium forms a clade within the Heterostelids. It contains the only species with an acellular stalk and except for one species, A. ellipticum, their spores are globose. The other Heterostelids have mainly elliptical spores with unconsolidated granules. The group 4 Dictyostelids have no polar granules. Species in groups 1\u20133 usually form multiple organizing tips on their aggregates, which give rise to multiple clustered fruiting bodies. Additional tips can also be formed later, initiating formation of side branches. Group 4 aggregates tend to form single tips giving rise to large solitary unbranched fruiting bodies, which also have a third cellular structure, the basal disk or supporter, to buttress the stalk. Group 4 species furthermore stand out by having lost the ability to encyst individually and by using cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) as chemoattractant (Schaap et al. 2006).",

The transition from growth to aggregation requires release of protein kinase (PKA) from translational repression. At this stage, PKA triggers a basal level of expression of genes required for aggregation, such as cAR1, PdsA and ACA, which enable the cells to synthesize and secrete cAMP pulses. In addition to inducing chemotaxis and cell aggregation, the cAMP pulses further upregulate the expression of aggregation genes. After aggregation, ACG is translationally upregulated in the posterior region of the emerging slug. ACG synthesizes cAMP that acts both on cARs and PKA to induce prespore gene expression. The prespore cells produce differentiation inducing factor (DIF) and DIF\u2010like factors that cause prestalk cell differentiation in combination with cAMP acting on cARs. Later, extracellular cAMP (cAMPex) becomes an inhibitor of stalk cell differentiation. During fruiting body formation intracellular cAMP (cAMPin) acting on PKA is essential for terminal maturation of spores and stalk cells. In the spores, active PKA blocks the transition from dormancy to germination.",

Pulsatile cAMP secretion probably evolved next when ACA activity came under control of cAR mediated positive and negative feedback.
