In late April 2003, the first outbreak of SARS occurred in one municipal hospital in Taipei. Soon, Taipei became the centre of a SARS outbreak that spread over the entirety of Taiwan in the span of six weeks.7 By late June, SARS had caused 73 fatalities in Taiwan, affecting physicians and nurses as well.8 SARS was a highly contagious, emerging infectious disease (EID) that, just like influenza, was spread through droplet aerosols and contact transmission. When countermeasures were taken to control the epidemic, the initial efforts suffered weaknesses including lack of adequate inter-organizational coordination, an unclear chain of command, inefficient resource allocation, poor risk communications, and disrupted information flows. The consequence was a total of 347 casualties, of whom 70% were from healthcare-associated infections and 30% were of healthcare workers (HCWs).7, 9, 10\n",

A univariate analysis demonstrated significant protective effects arising from reliance on Traffic Control. HCWs benefited from establishing fever screening stations, triaging fever patients, cohorting SARS patients, separating the entrances and traffic routes (Figure 1) for patients and HCWs, and increasing facilities for handwashing (P < 0.001). A multiple logistic regression found that triage with fever-screening stations outside the emergency department (ED) and setting up alcohol dispensers for handwashing between zones of risk were significant factors in protecting HCWs.",
