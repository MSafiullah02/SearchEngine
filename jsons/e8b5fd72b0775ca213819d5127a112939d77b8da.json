There are anecdotal reports of female health workers being expelled from their apartments in the Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Philippines due to fear they may be carrying COVID-19 [8] . Similar reports of harassment of female frontline health providers caring for patients have also arisen in India [9] . Gendered imbalances in access to resources may also result in male workers being prioritized for PPE [8] . In Italy and Spain, gender differences in COVID-19 infections among health workers are evident as twice as many female than male health workers have been infected with the virus [10] . While the COVID-19 Global Humanitarian Response Plan emphasizes the consideration of gender, the focus is on affected populations [6] . Protection of female humanitarian workers is dependent on organization-specific policies and not standardized across the sector.",

While women comprise more than the majority of humanitarian workforce, only 25% of leadership positions in humanitarian organizations are held by women [11] . Without gender balance in leadership positions, the specific needs of women may not be prioritized and women may not be included in decisionmaking or design of responses. This may lead to genderneutral policies or even gender-discriminatory practices. Where gender-equitable policies do exist, lack of effective implementation or enforcement is common [8] . Gender biases, at both individual and organizational levels, may be exacerbated in the context of COVID-19, as decisions about human resources, deployment and response activities may be made quickly, under stress and without inclusive input from women and underrepresented populations. Female humanitarians continue to face gendered pay gaps, that may be greater for national compared to international staff [12] , and their occupational risks may be further compounded by the gendered impacts of COVID-19. For example, they may be facing increased risk of intimate partner violence at home, and issues related to increased care-taking responsibilities; both have been impacted by the COVID-19 outbreak and response measures [13] . Mental health problems and stress are common adverse outcomes among workers responding to epidemics [14, 15] .",

Ensuring gender equitable access to PPE and information is imperative, yet insufficient on its own. Humanitarian organizations need to apply gender-based analysis to examine existing policies and response plans to identify gaps in support for female workers. As an immediate measure, these organizations need to ensure access to safe housing, equitable and adequate pay, childcare and appropriate safety measures when at work and during deployment. Essential workers should be granted insurance, medical and family benefits, psychosocial support and resources to mitigate the risks of intimate partner violence. COVID-19 specific organizational procedures are needed to protect special populations within the workforce, including pregnant staff. At the operational level, partnering with communities to address mistrust, misinformation and stigma toward humanitarian workers will be critical to ensure protection from harassment and violence. Ultimately, addressing gender biases is necessary to foster professional standards and culture that elevates the position of female humanitarian staff to ensure their insights and specific needs are considered, and that promotes women's leadership and equitable participation in decisionmaking.",
