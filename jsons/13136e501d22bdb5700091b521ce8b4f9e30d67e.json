For roughly 10 years after the first HIV case was first discovered on the mainland in 1986 (a foreign national diagnosed with AIDS), the best information available was from case reporting. However, during this period, nearly all cases were identified very late, when patients presented to hospitals with already severe symptoms of advanced HIV disease or AIDS. Thus, case reporting information was already many years out of date, and policymakers were unable to see the current picture of the HIV epidemic during this time. To make matters worse, while there were certainly more people living with HIV (PLWH) who were still undiagnosed compared to those diagnosed and therefore counted among case reports (i.e. a total of 20,711 by the end of 2003), there was uncertainty and substantial worry surrounding just how many Chinese citizens had HIV infection and did not know it .", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Thus, on advice from the World Health Organization (WHO) and under the leadership of the Chinese Academy of Preventive Medicine (the institute was renamed as Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention-China CDC, in 2002) , the National HIV Sentinel Surveillance System was developed and launched in 1995. This system did not take the place of case reporting. Rather, it acted in parallel, and the two sources of information were complementary to each other. The surveillance system began with collection of data among key, high-risk groups including drug users, female sex workers (FSW), pregnant women, sexually transmitted infection (STI) clinic attendees, long-distance truck drivers, and military recruits. It also began with data collection in geographical areas most affected by the HIV epidemic based on case reports, for example, Yunnan province. Although the system started out very small, with only 42 sentinel sites operating from 1995 to 1996, it quickly expanded both in terms of numbers of sites (i.e. 101 by 2000 and 194 by 2003) and in terms of key populations covered (i.e. former plasma donors [FPD] were added in 1998, men who have sex with men [MSM] were added in 2002).

It had also examined loss to followup along the continuum (Gu et al. 2016) and found that creating a simplified and streamlined patient pathway, known as the \"One4All\" strategy, from screening HIVreactive to receiving a confirmed diagnosis to being initiated on ART, regardless of CD4 count, had important clinical benefits including a dramatic reduction in allcause mortality (Wu et al. 2015 (Wu et al. , 2017 .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 419, "end": 435, "text": "(Ma et al. 2018)", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 496, "end": 512, "text": "(Gu et al. 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 815, "end": 830, "text": "(Wu et al. 2015", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 831, "end": 848, "text": "(Wu et al. , 2017", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "The 13th Five-Year Action Plan (2016-2020)"}, {"text": "Thus, when it came time for the State Council to draft its next five-year plan, some very important strategic changes were included.

Harm reduction measures still do not cover all those in need of services, and retention is persistently poor. Testing uptake even among those who are aware and knowledgeable, educated, and financially stable is suboptimal-many do not access testing frequently enough, and many more have never tested. HIV VCT services are slow, PITC services are poorly targeted and routinely identify infection too late, and self-testing, which could be very promising for reaching those who choose not to access facility-based or government-run testing services, suffers from a lack of regulation, quality assurance, and linkage to care mechanisms. Enormous numbers of PLWH who screen HIV-reactive or are diagnosed with HIV infection are lost to follow-up before they start treatment due to fragmented services, long wait times, complicated procedures, and difficulty in navigating a complex health system. Those who do successfully start treatment struggle with follow-up and adherence to medications and often do not achieve the all-important treatment goal of viral suppression. Furthermore, treatment for coinfections such as hepatitis B virus, hepatitis C virus, and tuberculosis is not integrated into HIV services.
