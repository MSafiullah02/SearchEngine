The revision of the original IES was done by Weiss and Marmar to better match the DSM-IV criteria for PTSD. As a result, a third cluster of symptoms that consists of seven items (hyperarousal subscale) was added to the original IES and its now known as IES-R.",

Back-translation is a standard procedure for translating a research questionnaire from English to other languages (Kim, Schwartz-Barcott, Holter, & Lorensen, 1995). Before using the Arabic version of IES-R in this study, its content validity was examined by five experts in the field. The responses of the experts revealed that the item content validity index (I-CVI) was 100% for each item which reflects a good content validity (Polit & Beck, 2006). Reliability coefficients (Cronbach's alpha) of the Arabic IES-R subscales were: 0.817, 0.779, 0.713 respectively, and 0.892 for total IES-R.",

In our study, we assessed posttraumatic symptoms among nurses and doctors in three hospitals after 6 weeks of the 2014 Israeli offensives against Gaza Strip in 2014, while Alhajjar assessed posttraumatic symptoms among nurses in all Gaza hospitals after 1 year of the 2012 Israeli war on Gaza.

Moreover, participants of this study reported higher means in total IES-R scale and its three subscales. These differences can be attributed to the fact that this war left higher numbers of deaths and causalities compared to the war of 2012. The war of 2014 continued for 51 days and left 2191 deaths and 10,895 wounded (Palestinian Center for Human Rights, 2014), while the war of 2012 continued for 8 days and left 158 deaths and 1269 were injured (Caabu, 2013).",

(2007) and examined posttraumatic symptoms among nurses and doctors at the last few days of the war erupted between Israel and Lebanon in 2006. The results of their study revealed that 10.5% of physicians and 35.7% of nurses had high levels of PTSD symptoms. Ben-Ezra et al. conducted a logistic regression model and found that nurses were 5.28 times more likely to endorse high levels of PTSD symptoms. The prevalence of PTSD among participants of Ben_Ezra et al. is much less than those reported in our study. Both studies revealed that nurses were at higher risks than doctors to develop PTSD. A few other studies reported higher prevalence of posttraumatic stress among nurses in comparison to doctors after exposure to a single trauma (Grieger et al., 2003, Luce et al., 2002, Maunder, 2004).",

            "text": "Such differences can be attributed to several reasons. First, as nurses spend more time with their clients than doctors do, they have more sympathy to their patients and they will be subject to more traumatic narratives as part of their duty, which can lead to more identification with their clients (Ben-Ezra et al., 2007). According to Regehr, Goldberg, and Hughes (2002), such sympathy and identification are assumed to put nurses at higher risk to develop PTSD. Second, as part of their medical training, doctors are exposed to cadavers and dead bodies which help them to develop coping strategies which resolved in higher resilience during the exposure to victims during war time (Weiniger et al., 2006). Finally, nurses have different responsibilities while taking care of the health status of their clients with less forensic responsibility and authority compared to doctors. Therefore; there is a higher possibility that doctors will perceive control over the situation in such situations which may reduce their feelings of helplessness in comparison to nurses (Luce et al., 2002). The high prevalence of PTSD among nurses and other health care providers in this study and other studies (Alhajjar, 2014, Ben-Ezra et al., 2007, Ben-Ezra et al., 2008) may question the common notion of resilience among hospital nurses and other health care providers (Luce et al., 2002).",

Consistently, other studies (Alhajjar, 2014, Ben-Ezra et al., 2007, Bryant and Harvey, 2003) reported similar findings as female nurses and doctors had higher scores than male nurses and doctors. In the three studies, these differences were found to have no statistical significance. The higher scores of PTSD among female participants could be related to the nature of women who shows more sympathy to their clients (Regehr et al., 2002) and to neurobiological factors (Fullerton et al., 2001) as females respond more effectively due to sertraline than males (Brady et al., 2000). Moreover, these differences could be attributed to the differential response biases in symptom reporting as male participants underreport symptoms due to cultural and societal factors (Kessler, 2000a, Kessler, 2000b) or it is possible that women are at higher risk for PTSD because of exposure to childhood trauma (Orr & Pitman, 1999).",

            "text": "This study had revealed a high prevalence of PTSD among health care providers after exposure to traumatic situations during the 2014 Israeli offensive against Gaza Strip in 2014. Such high prevalence rates will have negative consequences in the coming future on nurses and doctors, who constitute the back bone of the Palestinian health care system. Literature has connected PTSD with negative health outcomes (Wolfe, Schnurr, Brown, & Furey, 1994) and adverse psychological disorders (Gibbons, Hickling, & Watts, 2012) such as the existence of acute depression (Hickling et al., 2011, O'Donnell et al., 2004), anxiety, and adverse psychosocial impact (Hickling et al., 2011, Weinberg and Creed, 2000). Similarly, Weinberg and Creed (2000) added that health workers with post traumatic distress are more vulnerable to psychiatric disorders and ongoing social stress outside of work. Furthermore, the analysis of a study conducted by Niiyama et al. (2009) revealed that only 17% of nurses recovered from traumatic stress while the other 83% had persistent traumatic stress. Moreover; studies showed that prevalence of PTSD is associated with burn out syndrome, which together has a great impact on work and non-work related activities and perceptions (Mealer et al., 2009).",

They also should take further interventions to improve their mental health, to reduce the incidence of chronic PTSD and other possible psychiatric disorders, improve their job satisfaction and reduce burn out to retain them in their professions. Health policy makers should adopt special programs that offer counseling and treatment to health care providers. Treatment programs should include providing education, a feeling of safety, and support to the traumatized persons (Yehuda, 2002). More attention should be paid during treatment and counselling programs to female health care providers since they were at higher risk to develop PTSD.",
