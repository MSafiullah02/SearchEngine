He saw a 4-year-old boy with fever and a constellation of clinical features that did not seem to fit into any known clinical disease entity. By 1967, he had collected 50 such cases of mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome and published his series in the Japanese Journal of Allergy (Arerugi) [4]. It is remarkable that to this day, the case definition proposed by Dr. Kawasaki in 1967 has remained largely unchanged.",

The current incidence of KD in Japan is more than 300 per 100,000 children <5 years (highest worldwide) [8]. Approximately 1% of Japanese children develop KD by age 10 [9]. Incidence rates from Korea and Taiwan are 194.7 and 69.5, respectively [10, 11]. Incidence of KD in Europe and the United States has plateaued and ranges from 5 to 30/100,000 children below 5. Data from North America show that there is significant ethnic variation with higher rates being reported in African Americans and Pacific islanders [7]. KD is currently being diagnosed and reported from both China and India but nationwide data are not available in these countries [12\u201316]. In North India, the KD incidence is 4\u20135/100,000 children below 5 [16].",

The presence of febrile exanthemata and cervical lymphadenopathy, uncommon occurrence in babies below 3 months, and the rarity of cases in adults, further lends support to this hypothesis. Some of the infectious agents that have been linked to the etiology of KD are parvovirus, Epstein\u2013Barr virus, Staphylococcus aureus, chlamydia, and mycobacteria. It has been hypothesized that the putative infectious trigger sets up a cytokine storm that manifests as KD [23].

Fever with marked irritability may be the initial clinical presentation of KD, especially in young infants [30]. Presence of intermittent or remittent fever is not characteristic of KD. Cough can be present in a small subset of patients but nasal catarrh is unusual for KD. Rash in KD is usually generalized, erythematous, polymorphic (Fig. 4.3b), but is never vesicular or bullous. Cervical lymphadenopathy (\u22651.5 cm size) is usually unilateral and is often more commonly seen in the anterior cervical triangle. Cervical lymphadenopathy may be mistaken for suppurative lymphadenitis. AHA 2017 guidelines have highlighted the importance of ultrasonogram and computed tomography (CT) for differentiation of bacterial lymphadenitis from KD lymphadenopathy. In KD, there is enlargement of multiple lymph nodes along with retropharyngeal edema while bacterial lymphadenitis is mostly associated with a single lymph node with a central hypoechoic region [28]. However, such differentiation on basis of ultrasound examination requires lot of expertise and that may not be readily available in the usual clinical setting. Oral cavity and lip changes include redness of lips with bleeding and vertical cracking, oral mucosa redness and a strawberry tongue (Fig. 4.3d). Oral ulcers are distinctly unusual in KD. Conjunctival injection is characteristically nonexudative and with typical sparing of limbus (Fig. 4.3a). Conjunctivitis with discharge is a strong pointer towards an alternative diagnosis. Edema of the dorsum of extremities is an early sign and is usually transient (Fig. 4.3e). Perianal desquamation is virtually pathognomonic of KD and is a useful clinical sign for diagnosis of the disease during the acute phase (Fig. 4.3c). Arthritis in KD is typically oligoarthritis, involving large joints and resolves without sequelae [31]. Erythema at BCG injection site is an important clinical sign during acute stage of KD and more common in infants [32]. Hydrops of gall bladder is also an important finding during acute stage. Mild pericardial effusion is a common finding on 2Dechocardiography (2DE). CAAs are usually not seen during the first week of illness.",

Procalcitonin levels are normal in measles but may be elevated in KD. Other infectious causes that can mimic KD include viral infections (cytomegalovirus, adenovirus, Epstein Barr virus, and enterovirus), bacterial infections (bacterial cervical lymphadenitis, scarlet fever, toxic shock syndrome, staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome, and leptospira), and systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Absence of eye changes and lip changes, presence of sand paper rash, elevated antistreptolysin O titres, and a brisk response to antimicrobials are pointers towards scarlet fever. Presence of exudative conjunctivitis, ulcerative lesions in oral cavity, exudative pharyngitis, generalized lymphadenopathy and significant running nose are certain clinical features that make the diagnosis of KD less likely [28].",

Myocarditis can develop during acute stage and manifest with unexplained tachycardia, hemodynamic compromise, or cardiovascular collapse [44]. Approximately 5% patients with KD can present with cardiovascular collapse. This entity is known as KD shock syndrome (KDSS). The shock in these patients is multifactorial and may have both cardiogenic and distributive components. The distributive shock may result from cytokine storm leading to uncontrolled inflammation [45]. Patients with KDSS are usually present to emergency room and intensive care units with shock and may be inappropriately treated for bacterial sepsis and presumed septic shock. Diagnosis of KD gets often delayed in these cases and can have devastating consequences. Differentiation between KDSS and septic shock in the early phase of clinical diagnosis is often challenging. However, 2DE should always be performed in patients with fever and shock as presence of CAAs will suggest KDSS. Differentiation of KDSS and septic shock is critical as management of both diseases is entirely different. Presence of conjunctival injection, dorsal edema, perineal desquamation, incomplete response to antimicrobials, and no microbiological evidence for infection are indicators towards KD in these patients. These patients are reported to have increased risk of having IVIg resistance, CAAs , and myocardial dysfunction [28, 46, 47]. It is said that KDSS should always be considered in children presenting with fever, cardiovascular collapse and myocardial dysfunction. KDSS has been discussed at length in the AHA 2017 revised guidelines because of these highlighted facts [28].",

Manlhiot et al. have proposed definition of CAAs on the basis of Z score which is widely accepted currently and also has been adapted by AHA 2017 guidelines (Table 4.4) [28, 55]. It is mandatory to use body surface area-adjusted \u2018Z\u2019 scores for grading the severity of CAAs . Patients with a maximal Z score >+2.5 are classified to have aneurysm, while between 2 and 2.5 is considered dilatation. CAAs can presents in the form of absence of tapering of coronary arteries, coronary artery ectasia, dilation and aneurysms. Other than CAAs these patients can have myocardial dysfunction (reduced ejection fraction, fractional shortening), valvular regurgitation, pericardial effusion and aortic root dilation [44]. It is recommended to perform frequent 2DE examinations during acute phase of KD. After discharge, 2DE should be done 2 weeks and then 4\u20136 weeks later. It should be noted that normal 2DE examination in first 7 days of illness does not exclude development of CAAs .

A normal 2DE during this period may be mistakenly interpreted as having excluded coronary involvement.While normative data are available only for proximal segment of coronary arteries, there is paucity of literature on data for middle and distal segments of coronary arteries. Isolated involvement of distal segments of coronary arteries is uncommon but has been described [56].It has been suggested that an aneurysm may be better defined as a dilatation that is 1.5 times or more than an adjacent segment. This circumvents the problems associated with Z scores.Detailed and better evaluation of coronary arteries requires multiple transducer positions, imaging in multiple planes and high frequency transducers. Coronary artery diameters refer to the maximal internal luminal diameter. Measurements should not be taken at branching points.Limitations of 2DE include difficulty in visualization of distal coronaries, frequent non-visualization of left circumflex coronary artery, difficulty in commenting on stenosis or thrombosis and limited field of vision in older children because of thick chest walls. Another problem is due to artifacts especially while scanning the right coronary artery or left circumflex coronary artery.Several nomograms on Z scores are available and there may be variations in the measurements. Body surface area calculations have to be carried out meticulously and there is no consensus on the ideal method. It cannot be over-emphasized that a trivial difference in measurement of weight and height (especially in infants and young children) can significantly impact the calculations of Z scores.There are no normative data for \u201cZ\u201d scores for left circumflex coronary artery.\n",

Coronary artery thrombosis in patients with KD is contributed by acute inflammation, high platelet counts, endothelial dysfunction and stasis of blood flow due to abnormal dilatation. In patients with CAAs assessment with 2DE is mandatory to monitor size of aneurysm and presence of thrombus. Patients with large coronary artery aneurysms are at high risk of myocardial infarction especially in the first year after illness. They continue to be at increased life-time risk of developing coronary artery events [28]. Risk stratification of coronary artery aneurysm should take into account both current and maximal Z score. Along with a Z score classification the shape, location, number of aneurysms and coronary artery wall abnormalities should also be considered for prognostication and risk stratification [61].",

However, treating physicians can consider addition of another antiplatelet agent (e.g., clopidogrel) in patients with moderate size aneurysms. Patients having large or giant aneurysms are at very high risk for coronary artery complications including thrombosis and rupture. These patients should be treated with a combination of antiplatelet and therapeutic anticoagulation therapy. This includes low-dose aspirin along with either low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) or oral warfarin. LMWH should be given as 1 mg/kg/dose subcutaneously every 12 h. LMWH may be preferred to warfarin in acute phase because of added effects of anti-inflammatory and remodeling action. Transition from LMWH to oral warfarin may be considered in situations where the aneurysm has stopped progressing [28].",

Alternatively, the guidelines emphasize the role of intravenous pulse methylprednisolone (30 mg/kg/day, three doses) with tapering oral prednisolone. Administration of tapering course of prednisolone for 2\u20133 weeks with second dose of IVIg (2 g/kg) may also be considered in the retreatment of refractory KD patients. Infliximab (TNF-\u03b1 blocker), given as a single dose (5\u201310 mg/kg) intravenously, is also an important choice in treatment of refractory KD and appears to decrease the chances of developing CAAs [28]. Use of infliximab is associated with prompt reduction of fever. At our centre we prefer to use infliximab as second line therapy [63]. Cyclosporine may also be considered as an option in these circumstances. In highly refractory cases, plasma exchange, cytotoxic agents, or other biologicals have been used [28]. There are a few recent reports of successful use of the IL-1 receptor antagonist, anakinra, for the treatment of highly refractory KD [64].",

Because these patients have already developed a cardiac risk factor (even if there are no obvious CAAs during acute stage), a second risk factor like obesity, hyperlipidemia, or hypertension must be avoided [28]. Uses of statins have also been advocated in these situations. Patients having large and giant aneurysms should undergo frequent 2DE examinations for monitoring of size and associated complications.
