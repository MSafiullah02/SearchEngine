Design, setting and participants: A randomised single-blind controlled trial with a treatment duration of 3 days and a follow-up period of 4 days was conducted at a sauna in Berlin, , 157 patients with symptoms of the common cold were randomly assigned to an intervention group (n = 80) and a control group (n = 77). Interventions: Participants in the intervention group inhaled hot dry air within a hot sauna, dressed in a winter coat, whereas participants in the control group inhaled dry air at room temperature within a hot sauna, also dressed in a winter coat. Main outcome measures: Area under the curve (AUC) summarising symptom severity over time (Days 2, 3, 5 and 7), symptom severity scores for individual days, intake of medication for the common cold and general ill feeling. Results: No significant difference between groups was observed for AUC representing symptom severity over time (intervention group mean, 31.2 [SEM, 1.8]; control group mean, 35.1 [SEM, 2.3]; group difference, \u2212 3.9 [95% CI, \u2212 9.7 to 1.9]; P = 0.19). However, significant differences between groups were found for medication use on Day 1 (P = 0.01), symptom severity score on Day 2 (P = 0.04), and participants' ratings of the effectiveness of the therapy on Day 7 (P = 0.03). Conclusion: Inhaling hot air while in a sauna has no significant impact on overall symptom severity of the common cold.

Although the symptoms are generally benign, viral colds result in significant costs to the economy due to lost workdays and school attendance. 3 Convincing treatment options without side effects are not known. 4 Traditionally, the local application of heat is used to treat the symptoms of the common cold -for example, ingesting hot fluids such as tea or chicken soup, 5 or inhaling hot vapour. 6 Moreover, few clinical trials have been conducted to evaluate such treatment options. [6] [7] [8] It has been suggested that local hyperthermia of the nasal mucosa can affect rhinovirus replication. [7] [8] [9] A Cochrane review of six trials -one from Israel, two from the United Kingdom, and three from the United States -found that only the studies from Israel and UK showed that steam was beneficial for relief of common cold symptoms. 6 Results on symptom indices were equivocal; therefore, it was concluded that steam inhalation cannot be recommended for the routine treatment of common cold symptoms and further blind randomised controlled trials needed to be conducted.",

With the aim of heating the throat, people stay in this sauna for only a short period to avoid sweating.

The symptom severity score and general ill feeling data were evaluated using generalised estimation equation (GEE) regression models which modelled treatment group, time, group-time interaction, baseline values and participants' initial expectations from treatment as covariates. This resulted in adjusted symptom severity scores from which the adjusted AUC was calculated via the trapezoid rule (ie, linear interpolation of data points and summing up the resulting trapezoid areas). All reported treatment effects, 95% confidence intervals and P values are based on this GEE model. Similar GEE models were fitted to the dichotomous data on participants' use of medication for the common cold during the treatment period, assuming a logit link func-tion between covariates and response.

Also, blinding for the air temperature was difficult. In addition, the outcome measures we used were based only on participants' reports. We did not include any objective outcome measures, such as plasma cytokine levels 10, 11 or nasal airflow resistance. 5 Participants in our study started with a severity score of about 9 and reached a score of about 3 on Day 7. This course of disease is comparable with results from placebo groups in studies used to evaluate the efficacy of zinc acetate. 10, 11 After enrolment in the study, the severity score lowered without the initial worsening of symptoms that one would expect within the first 48 hours of a common cold. 12 Perhaps the peak of symptom severity had already been reached. However, initial worsening is often only observable in studies where participants suffer from an experimentally induced common cold. 13 Taking this lack of initial ",
