In order to do so, we built an e-cohort consisting of users of 4 medical chatbots designed to support patients with (1) asthma, (2) breast cancer, (3) depression and (4) migraine. A chatbot is a software leveraging artificial intelligence to provide a natural language conversation with a user. They can be use to monitor patients during treatment or to collect patient-reported outcomes (11) . Vik chatbots, developed by Wefight, have shown their interest in patient support and adherence to treatment (12) . They are also able to provide medical information to breast cancer patients with a level of quality comparable to physicians, as shown in the phase 3 randomized controlled trial INCASE (NCT03556813) (13) . The \"Vik Asthme\" chatbot is dedicated to information and management of asthma-related symptoms, the \"Vik Breast\" chatbot is specialized in the management of breast cancer patients, the \"Vik Depression\" chatbot accompanies patients with symptoms of depression and the \"Vik Migraine\" chatbot is helping patients with chronic migraine.",

The SARS-CoV2 can induce asthma exacerbations which are a source of additional stress for asthma patients. Initial data shows that asthma patients do not appear to be over-represented in patients with Covid-19 (14, 15) . In order to mitigate the lack of pathology control and treatment adherence during travel restrictions, the French government has implemented solutions to facilitate the renewal of treatment in the long term (16) . In addition, 60,000 hospitalizations are attributable to asthma every year in France (17) . This pandemic also represents a significant concern to cancer patients, who are at high risk of complications due to several predisposing factors (18) (19) (20) . In patients with breast cancer, management must be tailored and cannot be delayed. European countries have increased the use of telehealth systems to reduce the number of hospital visits. In Italy, these changes in care lead to many questions for patients, which can generate severe stress or anxiety (21) . The first studies conducted in China following the coronavirus pandemic have shown the impact on the mental health of healthcare workers, with an increased risk of depression and anxiety (22) . Patients already diagnosed with depressive disorder could be at a high risk of distress during the Covid-19 pandemic. Finally, migraine is a pathology with a high prevalence: it is estimated to be between 17% and 21% in adults aged 18 to 65 (23) with a sex ratio of 3 women to 1 man (24) . Despite its high prevalence, migraine remains an under-diagnosed and under-treated condition in the general population. Migraine can have a significant impact on the patient's quality of life (25) . Migraines can worsen in times of stress. This period of pandemic can generate a new source of stress and aggravate the pathology.",

This is due in part to the fact that one of the 4 groups explored consisted in breast cancer patients, but it could also show that men are less likely to participate in this kind of online self-reported survey. This fact could potentially bias the results and specifically the value of the features we found to be associated with a PDI over 14 (predictive of PTSD). Another limitation is due to the sampling technique itself, relying on groups of patients already using the chatbots, excluding patients not using them.
