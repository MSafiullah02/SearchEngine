This chapter focuses on the clinical utility, advantages, and disadvantages of these tests. Unfortunately, no FDA-cleared assays are available for the detection of the majority of bacterial and fungal pathogens associated with communityacquired pneumonia (CAP), hospital-associated pneumonia (HAP), and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). New promising technologies for the detection of bacterial agents of pneumonia currently in development or US FDA clinical trials are briefl y reviewed. Although sensitive, accurate fungal diagnostics is an area of importance, the development of new diagnostic assays has been signifi cantly delayed. Hence, for the detection of the vast majority of the nonviral pathogens, laboratory developed tests (LDTs) are the mainstay of molecular testing and will not be discussed. The importance of new rapid diagnostics for CAP, VAP, and HAP has been highlighted by a workshop conducted in November 2009 by the Infectious Diseases Society of America (IDSA) in collaboration with the FDA, the proceedings of which have been published in a special supplement of Clinical Infectious Diseases [ 102 ] .

Assays can detect mixed infections [ 79 ] and a broad range of viral types within a family [ 34 ] . Performance results from clinical trials for FDA clearance and from investigatorinitiated studies need to be reviewed carefully when evaluating an assay because many factors can affect the overall results, such as patient population and age, testing conditions, specimen collection factors, storage time from sample collection to testing, and comparator method used in the analysis. Similarly, results obtained in different studies can vary signifi cantly for assays and targets, depending on the study design (see references in Tables 52.2 and 52.3 ) . Numerous studies have demonstrated that not all targets within a particular assay are detected with the same sensitivity. NAATs also have certain limitations. Due to the complexity of primer and probe designs and interactions, highly multiplexed NAATs can sometimes be less sensitive than individual NAATs [ 70 , 166 , 167 ] . Reduced analytical sensitivity, however, does not always correlate with reduced clinical sensitivity since viral quantity in clinical samples, depending on the virus and timing of sample collection, are often much higher than the limit of detection of the assays. NAATs often are less sensitive for viruses with multiple serotypes, such as ADV [ 37 , 74 , 113 , 133 ] . Decreased performance for the detection of ADV can be clinically signifi cant, particularly when testing samples from immunosuppressed patients (e.g., transplant patients) for whom ADV infection has a high mortality rate if not treated. For highrisk patients, laboratories may elect to supplement testing with either a more sensitive, broadly reactive ADV-specifi c assay or with cell culture [ 25 , 62 , 148 , 173 ] . Many of the assays cannot distinguish between HRV and EV due to the fact that the assays target the 5\u2032 UTR which is genetically similar for the two viruses [ 113 ] . The performance of the assays, in particular for RNA viruses, also may be affected by sequence mutations that occur over time. These mutations can result in primer/probe mismatches that decrease assay sensitivity, result in a total lack of target amplifi cation and detection, or result in cross reactivity [ 153 ] . Any modifi cations to the assays to accommodate such genetic changes would have to be cleared by the FDA.

Additionally, pseudo-outbreaks of pertussis have been described, indicating that great caution must be used not only in performing the NAAT but also in the collection of test samples, particularly in areas where vaccine is administered.

These same advantages can also raise issues with the interpretation of results. Until recently the detection of any respiratory virus had been considered signifi cant. Several studies have shown that respiratory viruses can be detected in asymptomatic patients [ 2 , 14 , 104 , 181 ] . One study found that NAATs identifi ed a virus in 83 % of specimens from symptomatic children, but also detected a virus in 42 % of specimens from children without symptoms [ 2 ] . Another study demonstrated similar colonization with CoV (7.6 %) in symptomatic hospitalized children versus (7.1 %) in an asymptomatic outpatient control population. The overall prevalence of CoV or the types of CoV was not signifi cantly higher among hospitalized children than controls. Respiratory viruses in NP swabs were identifi ed from both asymptomatic and symptomatic solid organ transplant recipients early after transplantation [ 14 ] . The data suggest that due to the high prevalence of positive results in children and immunocompromised patients without symptoms, results should be interpreted cautiously, and in the context of clinical presentation, radiographic fi ndings, and other laboratory tests. Additionally, clinicians must be aware that NAATs will detect nucleic acids lingering from a previous infection and that samples submitted for assessment of therapeutic response may remain positive for days to weeks after treatment due to the presence of nonviable organisms and not due to treatment failure. In these situations culture or quantitative NAATs (see Future Directions below) may provide the best option. With the increased use of highly multiplexed respiratory virus assays, a variety of mixed viral infections are detected and the clinical importance of each virus is not always evident. Nonviable virus from a previous infection may be detected, making it impossible to determine which or if all viruses contribute to the current illness.

Are quantitative assays necessary or can assay cut off values be established at clinically relevant thresholds? (2) How many pathogens need to be included in a screening test? The detection of the broad scope of potential gram-positive and gram-negative bacterial pathogens is limited by multiplexing capabilities. Should these assays detect at a minimum those pathogens with the highest clinical impact or those diffi cult to treat? (3) How can we detect a broad range of resistance mechanisms, some of which do not have genetic markers (such as porin down-regulation in Pseudomonas spp.)? (4) Can we trust a positive result to direct antibiotic therapy? (5) Can we trust a negative result when there is the possibility of the presence of unknown resistance mechanisms?

Considerations include patient population(s), FDA status of the NAAT and the implications for regulatory issues, platform type, test complexity and technical expertise required, turnaround time, testing volumes, batch vs single unit testing, and the number and type of pathogens detected. The higher costs of NAATs can easily be offset by replacing the less sensitive test methods or by testing on site in lieu of referral to a reference laboratory [ 60 , 144 ] . Additionally costs can be offset by other demonstrated benefi ts, such as improvements in patient care and fi nancial outcomes, including 30 % reduction in antibiotic use, up to 20 % reduction in unnecessary diagnostic tests and procedures, and 50 % reduction in hospital days [ 9 , 22 , 82 , 92 , 115 , 120 , 123 , 142 , 170 , 191 , 227 , 229 ] . To achieve these benefi ts NAATs should be performed within 24 h of sample collection so that results are available within a clinically relevant time frame. With the advent of single unit cartridge/ pouch based tests that require minimal hands-on time and very minimal molecular technical expertise, all size laboratories can perform NAATs on all shifts. Considering the impact of global travel, comprehensive and highly specifi c NAATS should be performed year round and not limited to specifi c seasons. Although the positive predictive value of these tests remains high during times of low viral prevalence, laboratories should consider confi rmatory testing when a virus is detected during an unusual time period. Some pathogens are more prevalent in specifi c groups (e.g., RSV and HMPV in children and the elderly), but limiting testing to specifi c age groups will miss clinically relevant disease in other patient populations [ 64 , 83 ] . Infections with these pathogens can also sometimes have atypical presentations, such as pericarditis due to HMPV in an otherwise healthy adult [ 97 ] . Therefore, age may be useful in triaging initial testing but should not govern the fi nal scope of what viruses are included in diagnostic testing. In addition, if step wise testing is considered based on risk factors such as age or immune status, coinfections that could lead to serious nosocomial transmission in health care settings should not be missed.

ICs added after extraction will just confi rm the amplifi cation effi ciency and an external extraction control must be used unless the extraction method has demonstrated negligible inhibition (generally <1 %) for the sample types tested.
