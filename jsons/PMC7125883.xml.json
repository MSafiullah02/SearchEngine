A fall seasonal peak in asthma exacerbations has been reported in many studies and is widely associated with human rhinovirus (HRV) infections [2], [3], [4], [5], [6], [7], [8]. Severe asthma exacerbations, requiring the use of systemic corticosteroids (SCS), are a major cause of disease suffering and morbidity, account for significant asthma-related healthcare costs in the USA [9], [10], [11], and are the main risk factor and predictor for future exacerbations [12], [13], [14].",

This study set out to identify a pediatric population (4\u201311 years of age) at least 2 weeks prior to returning to their school, who were considered at risk for seasonal exacerbation based on recent prior history of exacerbation requiring treatment with SCS, emergency room (ER) visits or hospitalization. To investigate the viral etiology of exacerbations as they occurred during the fall season, this study utilized an at-home, symptom-driven, method for collection of mucus samples which were subsequently analyzed for viral content. As exacerbations are rare events, this study was not designed to demonstrate a statistically significant difference in exacerbation rates between treatment groups but rather to explore the relationships between treatment, respiratory symptoms, exacerbations, and viral etiology. Mucus sample collection was triggered by the presence of worsening asthma and/or cold symptoms. Samples were analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for the presence and identification of virus. The date of mucus collection, the asthma and/or cold symptom pattern, viral etiology, and date of exacerbation treatment facilitated the investigation of the association between viral presence and asthma exacerbation.",

It differs from many previous studies in that nasal mucus samples were collected in real time from children following a report of moderate-to-severe respiratory symptoms, rather than at the time of or shortly after asthma exacerbation. As the study design allowed for more frequent mucus collection, above and beyond times of exacerbation, this study allowed for the observation of viral infection patterns throughout the fall period. The results presented here demonstrate the feasibility of at-home mucus collection in a randomized, clinical trial setting, and provide evidence that the majority of viral infections in children being treated with control medications for persistent asthma do not cause exacerbations of asthma.",

Subjects were pre-screened for eligibility and were randomized between August 2nd, 2010 and August 13th, 2010. This ensured study treatment was administered for at least 2 weeks prior to the subjects' return to school. To allow the inclusion of subjects who may have taken a \u201csummer holiday\u201d from their controller medications, subjects were not required to be compliant with the use of their controller medication at the time of randomization.

Subjects were required to withhold albuterol \u22656 h pre-study visit.

This study design is in contrast to observational, cross-sectional, or cohort studies in which adherence to asthma control medications preceding the exacerbation is presumably low and in which nasal samples were collected at scheduled times [28]. Additional strengths of the study included a design which required the population to enter the study in a 2-week period in early August 2010; this enabled treatment of the entire study population for a minimum of 2 weeks prior to the start of most traditional school calendars. Also, the study employed \u201cjust in time\u201d mucus sample collection that was driven by the presence of moderate-to-severe upper respiratory symptoms and/or by the presence of signs of worsening asthma. Doing so demonstrated that symptom-driven, at-home, sample collection is feasible in a randomized controlled trial setting. Even though mucus collection was dependent on the parent's and child's compliance with the procedure at-home, this feature allowed for accurate classification of exacerbations in terms of viral etiology. The study also used a stringent and generally accepted definition of asthma exacerbation that required either SCS use, an acute care visit or hospitalization in accordance with the statement from the American Thoracic Society and European Respiratory Society on asthma control and exacerbations [29].",
