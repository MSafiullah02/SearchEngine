Given that mental states influence the activation of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS) and the parasympathetic nervous system (PNS) [14,15], and that HR is modulated by the SNS and PNS, researchers have associated HRV with mental characteristics such as attention span [14,16], decision making [17], social behavior [18,19], and emotional modulation [20].

The advances in information technology have introduced several new approaches to make health information more accessible than before. Among these approaches, smartphone photoplethysmography (PPG) has gained prominence [21,22]; it is an optical method that uses sensors to monitor the microvascular blood volume changes in body tissues [23]. As hemoglobin absorbs more light than the surrounding tissue, an increase (systole) or decrease (diastole) in the amount of blood can be assessed by employing the differences in the intensities of the lights and the converted waveforms. Smartphone PPG detects heartbeats by recording videos of fingertips using the in-built camera [24,25]. ",

Given that smartphones with in-built cameras have become a part of modern life, using them to access health information is an ideal alternative when ECGs or similar medical devices are not available [26]. In addition, there have been several reported techniques for increasing the accuracy of smartphone PPG, such as point-of-interest selection [27], bandpass filtering [28], adaptive signal thresholding [29], motion detection techniques [30,31,32], interpolation techniques [33], and signal decomposition methods [34,35,36].

When smartphone users measure their heartbeats outside a laboratory environment, slight hand movements or ambient light changes can corrupt the PPG signals. Software designed to process the camera signals have limited control over the underlying operating system and hardware. Further, camera settings\u2014especially exposure and white balance\u2014differ between smartphone models and may change automatically when the environment changes. The low frame (sampling) rate of smartphone cameras is another source of randomness [42,43]. The sampling rate can be as high as 1000 Hz for medical equipment [44]; however, for most smartphone cameras, it is less than 30 Hz [40], and this can result in the fiducial point detection technique (FPDT) easily missing the actual point. Frame rate instability\u2014as a design to prevent the CPU from overloading or overheating\u2014further degrades the acquisition performance [26,45].",

Based on the physiological studies of the radial pulse waveform [47], the current study designed a sinusoidal function-based regression model that can fit the right-skewed pulse signal and determine the quality of data using the success rate of the convergence in the optimization. Further, we conducted an empirical experiment to validate the proposed approach. The potential uses and limitations are also discussed before concluding this paper.",

Given that this study only recorded 5-min videos, the ULF and VLF bands did not apply [56]. The HF and LF values were log-transformed because they are not distributed normally [43,57]. The time-domain indices of HRV quantify variability in the BBI. This study included three commonly used time-domain measures for comparison: rMSSD, pNN50, and SDNN. Nonlinear HRV measures are computationally complex and were accordingly excluded from this study.",

After a 5-min debriefing, participants were asked to remain seated for the entire data collection process. They were asked to wear an ECG chest strap (H10, Polar Electro Oy, Finland; sampling rate 1000 Hz [67]) and hold a smartphone (Mi 8 SE, Xiaomi, China; sampling rate 30 Hz) in their left hand. A self-developed app was then used to record 5-min videos of their fingertip multiple times during the 1-h session. A total of 1343 valid datasets were collected. The accuracy of the ECG chest strap is well-established in the literature [21], and studies employ the chest strap in detecting HRV for convenience when a 24-lead ECG is not available [68,69].",

Although there have been many different suggestions for the minimum sampling rate (ranging from 25 Hz [42] to 125 Hz [43] in PPG studies and 50 Hz [71] to 1000 Hz [72] in ECG studies), most smartphone cameras sample at about 30 Hz, which is below the level of most suggestions. Therefore, the poor measuring quality caused by low frame rates is generally considered a potential challenge to the validity of using the smartphone PPG method. However, researchers have proposed various methods to improve the accuracy rate at low frame rates [33], and empirical studies have also indicated that smartphone PPG results are comparable to those obtained using gold standard ECGs [21,28,37,38,39,40]. There seems to be conflicting suggestions and conclusions in the literature, and therefore, more empirical evidence is required to clarify this issue. Further, smartphone-based physiological assessment applications are usually considered low-cost, convenient tools for public health and personal use. Many smartphone PPG studies, including the current study, aim to validate this new technology as an acceptable alternative when more sophisticated devices are not available, rather than using it as a substitute for medical-grade equipment.",
