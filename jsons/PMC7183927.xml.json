The clinical symptoms are similar to that of any other acute respiratory viral infection and include fever, cough, sore throat, breathlessness, fatigue, malaise, etc. It has been observed that nasal symptoms are less pronounced in SARS-CoV-2 infection. The disease is mild in about 80% of the reported cases. In those with co-morbidities and elderly, the disease is often severe progressing to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and multi organ dysfunction [8]. The case fatality rate is estimated to range from 0.25 to 3%; it is much higher in elderly and those with co-morbidities [9]. Based on the current data, children seem to be less frequently affected and the disease may be less severe; however, the situation may change. Children however may have asymptomatic infection and also prolonged fecal-shedding, which may contribute to the spread of the pandemic [10].",

Recently, point of care antibody tests have also been approved; their role in clinical management needs to be defined. Common laboratory findings include normal/ low white cell counts with elevated C-reactive protein (CRP). X-ray and CT scan pictures in moderate to severe illness are suggestive of diffuse bilateral involvement of lungs [11]. Treatment consists of mainly supportive care; while role of antiviral agents is being evaluated. Prevention is the key and home isolation of exposed individuals, management of symptomatic cases in healthcare facilities, and strict infection control measures at hospitals may help break the chain of transmission [12].",

The median (IQR) age was 7 (2, 13) y and 1213 cases (57%) were boys. Among laboratory confirmed cases, proportion of asymptomatic, mild, moderate, severe and critically ill infections was 12.9%, 43.1%, 41%, 2.5% and 0.4%, respectively. Children with confirmed diagnosis had milder clinical course than suspected cases (which could include other prevalent viruses like respiratory syncytial virus, influenza, and para-influenza etc. in this age group); indicating that severity of SARS-CoV-2 illness could be milder than other acute respiratory infections in this age group. The median time from onset of illness to diagnosis was 2 d (range: 0\u201342 d). Proportion of \u2018severe and critical\u2019 cases was 10.6%, 7.3%, 4.2%, 4.1% and 3.0% for the age group of \u02c21, 1\u20135, 6\u201310, 11\u201315 and > 15 y, respectively; indicating that young children, especially infants, were more vulnerable to severe SARS-CoV-2 infection. One child (14-y-old) died. This study didn\u2019t describe frequency of individual symptoms in their population [16]. Patients with severe manifestation usually develop features of hypoxemia and hypoperfusion by end of first week.

Children usually have milder disease.

In pediatric series, common patterns on CT scan showed GGO (32.7%), local patchy shadow (18.7%), bilateral patchy shadow (12.3%), and interstitial abnormalities (1.2%) [15]. Another study of CT scan in children with COVID-19, showed more bilateral (50%) than unilateral involvement (30%). Common patterns of CT involvement were GGO, consolidation with surrounding halo sign, fresh mesh shadow and tiny nodules [14]. These findings represent interstitial involvement of parenchyma. Chest X-rays should be considered in children requiring oxygen at admission or showing increase in respiratory distress or increase in requirement of respiratory support suggesting disease progression. This may suggest severe illness or early deterioration. Children not admitted to HDU or ICU may require a chest X-ray if they have worsening hypoxemia, particularly, if they have pre-existing conditions.",

Hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine have been demonstrated to have anti-SARS-CoV-2 activity in in-vitro studies. Mechanisms for anti-viral activity of hydroxychloroquine include inhibiting membrane fusion by increasing pH of endosome/lysosome, inhibiting virus entry by changing glycosylation of ACE2 receptor and spike protein, and immune-modulation [25]. In an open-labelled uncontrolled trial in adults, there was significant reduction in viral load with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin therapy compared to routine care [26]. Clinical trial of Lopinavir/Ritonavir (protease inhibitors impairing virus assembly) in adults was not associated with improved 28-d mortality (19.2% vs. 25.0%; difference, \u22125.8 percentage points; 95% CI, \u221217.3 to 5.7) [27]. But the study only included the most severe patients [27]. Starting the therapy early, before multi-organ dysfunction sets in, might be more appropriate approach. It is to be seen if early therapy with these drugs would have any impact on disease progression and need for mechanical ventilation. Currently there are no pediatric studies. Clinical indications for starting virus-suppressive therapy (either Hydroxychloroquine or Lopinavir/Ritonavir) include patients with suspected or confirmed COVID-19 with \u201csevere pneumonia\u201d or \u201ccritically ill patients\u201d.Hydroxychloroquine 7\u20138 mg/kg/dose twice daily for Day 1 and then Day 2\u20135, 7\u20138 mg/kg once a day.Lopinavir/Ritonavir: Suggested dose of LPV/r is 10 mg/2.5 mg per kg twice daily for maximum 14 d; maximum dose is 400 mg/100 mg twice daily.

In critically ill patient with hyper-inflammatory response, anti-IL-6 receptor antibodies (Tocilizumab, Sarilumab) are another promising therapies under investigation [29]. Recently, a case series of 5 adults with ARDS with high viral load were treated with convalescent plasma transfusion (SARS-CoV-2 specific IgG titer greater than 1:1000) with favourable clinical outcome [30]. Other drugs described for SARS-CoV-2 without proven efficacy include antiviral (interferons, ribavirin) and anti-inflammatory (azithromycin) agents [28, 29].
