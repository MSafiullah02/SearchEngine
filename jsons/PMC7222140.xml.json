Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PH) can occur in 15\u201325% of infants with sBPD, and is associated with an increased risk of mortality [2\u20134]. Recognizing this concern, the American Heart Association recommends screening echocardiography to monitor for PH in infants with BPD [5]. However, echocardiographic parameters are limited by subjective, varied, or missing measures, as well as modest correlation with pulmonary arterial pressure measured via cardiac catheterization [6\u20139]. Further, screening for PH often varies from center to center. Understanding whether standard clinically used echocardiographic parameters of PH are associated with mortality would help to inform clinical practices with respect to screening infants with sBPD for PH.",

We compared the clinical characteristics by SP and RVSP groups of normal, abnormal and missing, using chi-squared or Fisher\u2019s exact tests for differences in proportion and Kruskal\u2212Wallis nonparametric tests for differences of medians. For the unadjusted association between echocardiographic parameters and mortality, we calculated the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value, and relative risk. Next, all covariates with bivariate association of p < 0.05 were entered into multilevel multivariable logistic regression models with center as a random intercept. Because we assumed the echocardiographic exposure variables to be collinear, we ran two separate models, one with septal position alone as the exposure, and one with RVSP alone as the exposure. For each model, abnormal and missing echocardiographic parameters were each tested against a referent group of infants with normal echocardiographic parameters. Statistical significance was defined as p value < 0.05. SAS v 9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, North Carolina) was used for analyses.",

Of those, 2806 infants had sBPD and 1412 (50%) infants with sBPD had one or more echocardiograms between 34 and 44 weeks\u2019 PMA. We excluded 255 infants who were transferred to another hospital before discharge. This resulted in a study cohort of 1157 infants; 1042 (90%) survived to hospital discharge, while 115 (10%) died. Infants who died had a later PMA at admission to the NICU (median 31 days [IQR 27\u201338] vs. 28 [IQR 26\u201333], p < 0.001), lower birthweight (median 685 g [IQR 560\u2013840] vs. 748 g [IQR 620\u2013910], p = 0.001), were on the ventilator longer (median 102 days [IQR 51\u2013144] vs. 42 days [IQR 19\u201371], p < 0.001), and were more likely to have received systemic corticosteroids (69% vs. 38%, p < 0.001) or to have received a diagnosis of necrotizing enterocolitis (22% vs. 10%, p = 0.001) than infants who survived. The cause of death in our cohort was primarily respiratory failure (67%, n = 77/115), followed by multiorgan system failure (16%, n = 18/115). Forty-six infants (60%, n = 46/77) who died of respiratory causes also had a clinical diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension. Less common causes of death were intra-abdominal catastrophe (4%), central nervous system injury (3%), infection (3%), renal failure (3%), and other causes (4%). Infants with abnormal septal position and RVSP had a median of 2 echocardiograms, and infants with normal or missing parameters had a median of one echocardiogram during their neonatal hospitalization. As shown in Table 1, infants with abnormal RVSP measurements had echocardiograms performed at a slightly later PMA those with normal measurements (34 weeks vs. 30 weeks), and the median PMA of echocardiogram attainment in infants with abnormal and normal septal position was 31 weeks.",

Ventilation at 36 wks\u2019 PMA, bloodstream infection, postnatal steroid use, and admission PMA remained significantly associated with mortality in adjusted RVSP models.

            "text": "Pulmonary hypertension is a significant contributor to morbidity and mortality in premature infants with BPD [2, 15\u201318]. In 2015, the American Heart Association recommended echocardiographic screening of infants with moderate or severe BPD beginning at 36 weeks PMA with serial echocardiography thereafter [5]. Compared to cardiac catheterization, echocardiographic screening for PH has been limited in its ability to detect and grade the severity of pulmonary hypertension [7]. We found that infants with documented abnormal RVSP or septal position had approximately double the odds of mortality, compared to infants with normal echocardiographic parameters. This association persisted even after adjusting for other significant predictors of mortality including gestational age, receipt of mechanical ventilation at 36 weeks\u2019 PMA, atrial septal defect, bloodstream infection, postnatal corticosteroid use, and PMA at admission to the participating center. These results demonstrate that even among sick neonates with severe BPD, abnormal SP and RVSP are independent predictors of mortality. In that context, our results demonstrating the potential impact of real-world echocardiographic data provide further support for adherence to the new guidelines.",

            "text": "When we compared infants with missing echocardiographic data to infants with normal parameters for septal position, we found that infants with missing data had an odds of mortality that was similar to infants with normal echocardiographic parameters. Mourani et al. found that the sensitivity and positive-predictive value of echocardiographic parameters for the detection of PH is enhanced when tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity can be measured as a proxy for pulmonary artery pressure [7]. Unfortunately, several studies have noted the challenge of obtaining tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity measurements, even when echocardiography is being performed in accordance with prespecified research protocols and on older pediatric patients [19, 20]. Indeed, in our cohort, tricuspid regurgitant jet velocity and resultant right ventricular systolic pressure was recorded in only 27% of echocardiographic reports, highlighting the practical limitations of obtaining this important variable at the bedside. Septal position was more commonly documented in our cohort, with 73% of echocardiographic reports having documentation of septal position. Assignment of septal position may be subject to considerable subjectivity and interobserver variability [21]. More quantitative measures of septal position, such as eccentricity index, are now being investigated in infants with BPD and hold promise as a means of standardizing the echocardiographic approach [19, 22]. Nonetheless, our finding that infants with missing echocardiographic data had mortality rates similar to infants with documented normal echocardiographic parameters suggests that the inherent difficulties of obtaining standard echocardiographic measurements should not prevent efforts at screening. Further, echocardiography correctly identified infants who were likely to survive, as shown by the high specificity and negative predictive values of both septal flattening and RVSP in our study. As such, septal position and RVSP measures on echocardiography between 34 and 44 weeks\u2019 PMA can be helpful in delineating risk status for in-hospital mortality in infants with sBPD.",

            "text": "Surprisingly, only half of our initial cohort of infants with severe BPD had screening echocardiography between 34 and 44 weeks\u2019 PMA. This finding is in keeping with recent surveys of neonatal members of the American Academy of Pediatrics. This survey found that 83% of physicians would obtain an echocardiogram at 36 weeks\u2019 corrected gestational age for infants with moderate or severe BPD, but only 46% of respondents had a formal screening program in place at their institution that facilitated the implementation of these guidelines [23]. Our study cohort occurred prior to the publication of the recent American Heart Association screening guidelines; future work, including our observations in this study, should serve to increase the rate of screening for PH in infants with BPD. Quality initiatives to standardize the approach to PH screening in infants with BPD across sites are now being developed. Even as screening efforts advance, we acknowledge that data are limited on whether early detection and pharmacologic treatment of pulmonary hypertension in infants with severe BPD improves survival. Retrospective evaluations of this association may be plagued with concerns about confounding by indication, and the feasibility and cost of randomized controlled trials can be prohibitive. Additionally, the natural course of milder forms of pulmonary hypertension is to resolve without pharmacologic therapy [24, 25]. However, identifying the patients at risk for poor outcomes is essential in the neonatal period to allow appropriate risk categorization and follow-up after hospital discharge. Overall, one in four infants with severe BPD may develop pulmonary hypertension, but 41\u221262% will be diagnosed after hospital discharge and will experience morbidity and mortality in the first year of life as a result of their diagnosis [1, 2, 24, 26]. As such, even while the efficacy of pharmacologic therapy for pulmonary hypertension is being evaluated, echocardiographic screening for infants with severe BPD may allow proven interventions such as aggressive management of respiratory acidosis, prevention of intermittent hypoxia, targeting of optimal nutrition and feeding modes, and engagement of multidisciplinary care to be employed early and aggressively in order to improve outcomes for high-risk infants [1, 27\u201331].",
