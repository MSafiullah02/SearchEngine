Frequently observed chronic inflammation in CKD patients on maintenance intermittent haemodialysis (HD) plays a crucial role in the development of progressive atherosclerosis and related cardiovascular events such as myocardial infarction and stroke [1\u20135]. Pharmacological blockade of RAS exerts beneficial effects in these patients and slows, but does not prevent, cardiorenal disease progression, suggesting the involvement of other, noncanonical RAS factors [6\u20138]. The actions of the classical RAS are mediated by angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), which generates angiotensin II (AngII), a potent vasoconstrictor and main RAS effector. Pro-inflammatory and pro-proliferative actions of AngII may be counteracted by the recently described ACE2, which degrades AngII to Ang1-7, a potent vasodilator [9, 10].",

            "text": "Both ACEs are abundantly expressed in human cardiac, pulmonary and renal tissues and other organs such as liver, placenta and the central nervous system [11\u201315]. ACE is also expressed on the surface of monocytes, macrophages and smooth muscle cells [16, 17]. Recently we demonstrated that elevated levels of monocytic ACE in HD patients are associated with increased mortality and cardiovascular morbidity and may also participate in the initial steps of atherosclerosis [5, 18, 19]. Our recent investigations revealed that uremic conditions upregulate the expression of monocytic ACE and drive the monocytes to pro-atherogenic differentiation via an AngII-dependent mechanism [20]. Mouse models demonstrated that ACE deficiency in bone marrow\u2013derived cells decreased hypercholesterolemia-induced atherosclerosis, while macrophages from ACE2-deficient mice promoted atherosclerosis by increased expression and release of inflammatory cytokines and elevated adhesion of these cells to endothelial cells [17, 21]. Conversely adenovirus-mediated ACE2 overexpression in atherogenic animal models was able to decrease pro-atherosclerotic actions and improve endothelial homeostasis by decreasing monocyte adhesion [22, 23].",

Amplifications of macrophage colony-stimulating factor (MCSF), AT1R, angiotensin II type II receptor (AT2R), intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1), monocyte chemotactic protein-1/chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (MCP-1/CCL2)) and RPL37A were performed with sequences and conditions according to Trojanowicz et al.

Furthermore, in individuals with high risk for vascular events or hyperlipidemic patients, expression of AT1R in circulating leukocytes was noticeably elevated as compared with a healthy low-risk control group [26]. Pharmacological intervention by either RAS blockers or statins led to decreased expression of AT1R and, by interfering with AngII, exerted anti-inflammatory actions in these patients [26\u201328]. Recently, Chon et al. [26] studied nondialyzed CKD patients and found that despite a relevant antihypertensive effect, angiotensin blockade did not consistently affect AT1R leukocytic expression. The authors postulated that factors involved in uremia are more dominant modulators of leukocytic AT1R expression in these patients. In contrast to these findings, therapy with AngII receptor blockers in our HD patients led to some degree of reduction of leukocytic AT1R and AT2R expression.",

This effect is most likely transmitted via formation of AngII and ligation of the AT1R, since it can be inhibited by ACE inhibition, and in part by angiotensin receptor blockade. Such interaction via AT1R has been demonstrated previously [29]. The expression pattern found in dialysis patients is associated with enhanced expression of adhesion molecules ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 as well as the activating cytokine MCSF. In the transfection experiments, overexpression of ACE induces these molecules and the angiotensin receptor blocker losartan reverts the induction. In contrast, overexpression of ACE2 has the opposite effects, with downregulation of the adhesion-promoting molecules.",

            "text": "Our results allow speculation that the uremic milieu induces a specific dysregulation of ACE/ACE2 expression that is responsible for the formation of a pro-inflammatory and adhesive monocyte phenotype. This fits well with our earlier data showing high expression of ACE on monocytes in dialysis patients in association with subclinical atherosclerosis [5] or cardiovascular mortality [18]. In comparison with a healthy population with significantly lower leukocytic MASR and up-regulated ACE2 levels, it seems that the uremic environment, and especially uremic toxins, may affect the proper function of a local ACE2\u2013MASR axis as a counterregulatory mechanism. Uremic toxins are not only able to induce the vascular damage of CKD, but also may induce the components of the RAS [33\u201337]. Shimizu et al. [34] demonstrated that indoxyl sulphate (IS), one of the most representative uremic toxins, upregulated angiotensinogen (AGT) expression in proximal tubular cells. Sun et al. [35] reported that IS and p-cresol sulphate upregulated, in addition to elevated AGT expression, other renin\u2013angiotensin\u2013aldosterone system components such as renin and AT1R. Studies by Vanholder et al. [36] and Pletinck et al. [37] showed clearly that pro-inflammatory effects triggered by protein-bound uremic toxins contribute to vascular damage and renal disease progression by stimulating crosstalk between leukocytes and the vessel wall. Our data cannot rule out an additional participation of the systemic RAS, particularly since Kovarik et al. [24] demonstrated elevated Ang1-7 levels in HD plasma that may strongly upregulate leukocytic MASR. It is also worth noting that human macrophages react to inflammatory stimuli such as LPS with increased MASR transcripts [38]. On the other hand, it has been reported that oral administration of IS to CKD rats led to decreased levels of MASR in proximal tubular cells [39]. Such a contrary expression as compared with increased MASR in uremic leukocytes could be explained by different roles of the Ang1-7\u2013MASR axis in mesangial and tubular cells within the kidney and other cells such as circulating leukocytes.",
