Thus far, various sensing materials for uncooled microbolometers have been studied. Among them, vanadium oxide is the most widely used given its high temperature coefficient of resistance (TCR; >2.5%/K) and low-cost preparation methods [1,2]. However, this material shows a narrow operating temperature window due to the semiconductor-metal transition at ~67 \u00b0C, as well as difficulty in controlling the precise composition during deposition [2], [3], [4].",

            "text": "Recently, various efforts have been made to find alternative bolometer-sensing materials. Spinel materials based on nickel manganite are one of such promising materials. Until now, nickel manganite based spinel thin films have been fabricated by various methods [5], [6], [7], [8]. Kong et al. fabricated Mn-Co-Ni-O (MCN) thin films by RF magnetron sputtering method [5]. Ji et al. also fabricated MCN thin films using laser molecular beam epitaxy technique [6]. However, these vacuum processes have the disadvantage of expensive process costs. Several groups including He et al. fabricated nickel manganite based spinel thin films using chemical solution deposition method, but it requires a relatively high annealing temperature [7,8]. In previous study, we have also fabricated [(Ni0.2Mn0.8)1-\nx Cux]3O4 (0.25 \u2264 x \u2264 0.40) thin films using the metal-organic decomposition (MOD) method, and demonstrated that the thin films have high absolute TCR values (>3%/K) and low resistivity (<50 \u03a9 cm) [4]. Although the TCR and resistivity outcomes are sufficient, it is not easy to apply them for use in an uncooled microbolometer because the annealing temperature is too high (450 \u00b0C). Temperature-sensing materials for a microbolometer require a low annealing temperature (\u2264400 \u00b0C) for the direct integration onto a substrate having complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) read-out circuitry [9].",

Resistivity is dependent on the cation distribution, i.e., the ratio of Mn3+ and Mn4+ in B sites, and the ratio can be changed by controlling the amount of Ni2+ in B sites [11]. Thus, the control of nickel and manganese composition has a great influence on the electrical properties of manganite materials and can lower the annealing temperature while maintaining reasonable level of electrical properties.",

The elemental distribution of Ni, Mn and Cu ions at the surface of the annealed films was investigated by means of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, PHI 5000 Versa Probe\u2122, ULVAC-PHI, Japan) using monochromatized Al K\u03b1 (1486.6 eV) X-ray source with a power of 25.3 W. The XPS spectra were obtained with the analyzer pass energy of 23.5 eV and the electron take-off angle was set at 45\u00b0. The beam diameter was 100 \u03bcm. The binding energies were calibrated based on the C1s peak at 284.8 eV. The resulting spectra were fitted with the Multipak software. Fitting was performed after Shirley background subtraction and XPS peaks were deconvoluted as Gaussian-Lorentzian components with specified binding energy value for each element. The formation of spinel structure was identified using Fourier-transform infra-red (FT-IR, Nicolet iS50, Thermo, USA) spectroscopy. The resistivity of the thin films was measured by the four-point probe system (VP75, DSF System, Korea) in a temperature range of 25 \u00b0C to 85 \u00b0C.",

The thicknesses of all annealed films, regardless of the Ni content, are very thin (about 100 nm). The annealed films and SiNx/Si substrates have good adhesion without any delamination. It should be noted that the film surface seems non-flat for rather low Ni content (x = =0.2 ~ 0.35), while other samples show quite flat surface for higher Ni incorporation (x = =0.4). This difference in surface morphology, depending upon the content of Ni, can be clearly seen in the top-view FE-SEM images of the sample surfaces, as shown in Fig. 2\n. Protruding net-like morphology was formed on film surfaces for rather low Ni content. As the Ni content increases up to 0.4, however, the net-like undulation disappears completely and the film surface gets flat.",

Moreover, the octahedral preferences of Cu2+, Ni2+, Mn3+ and Mn4+ are in the order of Mn4+ > Mn3+ > Ni2+ > Cu2+, while Cu+ and Mn2+ have a high tendency to occupy A-sites [15]. According to these empirical rules, Cu+ and Mn2+ ions fill A-sites preferentially, and Cu2+ ion (has lower priority for B-sites) then fills the remaining fraction of A-sites. On the other hand, B-sites are occupied by other cations (Ni2+, Mn3+, Mn4+, and excess Cu2+). To calculate the cation distribution in AB2O4 spinel film, the fraction of each cation for A and B sites should be quantified. For a given Ni fraction (experimental variable), the quantity of Ni, Mn, and Cu in [(NixMn1-\nx)0.84Cu0.16]3O4 film can easily be calculated. For x = =0.2 as an example, simple calculation leads to Ni0.504Mn2.016Cu0.480O4, which shows the total amount of Ni, Mn, and Cu. Then, for multi-valence ions of Mn and Cu, the fraction of each valence cation can be calculated by multiplying the relative abundance measured by XPS (given in Table 1). For Mn, the quantity of Mn2+ cation is calculated to be 0.872 (=43.23% %\u00d7 2.016). The quantity of other cations such as Mn3+, Mn4+, Cu+, and Cu2+ can be obtained by similar procedure. Finally, the spinel film AB2O4 should be filled with cations, based on empirical rules discussed above, as [Mn2+, Cu+, Cu2+] ions for A sites and [Ni2+, Mn3+, Mn4+, Cu2+] ions for B sites, respectively. For the A sites, the sum of three cations should be unity, while that for the B sites be two. Note here that Cu2+ ions fill A sites that are not filled with Mn2+ and Cu+. The remaining Cu2+ ions then fill the B sites. Table 2\nshows the calculated cation distribution in each prepared [(NixMn1-\nx)0.84Cu0.16]3O4 (0.20 \u2264 x \u2264 0.40) thin films.",

As the temperature increases, the resistivity decreases, which is a typical characteristics of negative-temperature-coefficient (NTC) thermistor. Further, the resistivity decreases with the increase of Ni content in the films. In order to explain the electrical properties of NTC materials based on nickel-manganite, it is necessary to understand the small polaron hopping model as well as the surface morphology [7]. The electrical conductivity of nickel-manganite-based NTC materials is affected by carrier hopping between Mn4+ and Mn3+ ions at the B sites [16,19]. Therefore, the dependence of the resistivity on the Mn4+/Mn3+ values in Fig. 6 is due to the carrier hopping between Mn3+ and Mn4+. As shown in Table 2, Ni plays a role in controlling the ratio of Mn3+ and Mn4+ in B sites. The small polaron hopping model is expressed by the following equation [20],(1)\u03c1(T)=CT\u03b1exp(T0/T)p,where C is a constant, T is the absolute temperature, \u03b1 and p are power law exponents, and T\n0 is the characteristic temperature. When \u03b1 = =p = 1, the electron hopping model becomes the nearest-neighbor hopping (NNH) model, and the spinel manganite film generally follows the NNH model. Therefore, the expression of Eq. (1) can be rewritten as follows:(2)\u03c1(T)=CTexp(T0/T)\n",

The annealed films (~ 100 nm thick) showed NTC thermistor characteristics with a decrease in the resistivity upon an increase in the temperature. The morphological uniformity has been improved with the increase of Ni content, while the electrical resistivity was decreased from 131.2 \u03a9 cm to 31.3 \u03a9 cm. Concurrently, the increase of Ni content has also led to the increase in the ratio of Mn4+/Mn3+ close to unity, leading to the decrease in resistivity. This is because the Mn ions at the B sites have strong contribution to the electrical properties of the films by participating in hopping transport. Although the T\n0 (from 2876 K to 2314 K), E\na (from 0.2479 eV to 0.1995 eV), and TCR (from \u22123.196%/K to \u22122.571%/K) decrease slightly with the increase of Ni content x (from 0.20 to 0.40), the processing temperature could be reduced below 400\u00b0C, which enables the direct integration of the materials onto substrates having CMOS read-out circuitry.
