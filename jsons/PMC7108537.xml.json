            "text": "Lactic acid bacteria (LAB) are a heterogeneous group of bacteria that are used in various biotechnological applications. With respect to human and animal health, many LAB are being used as mucosal delivery vehicles for therapeutic and prophylactic molecules because of their GRAS (Generally Regarded As Safe) status (Eijsink et al. 2002), their probiotic properties and the ease with which they can be engineered to express heterologous proteins (Ouwehand et al. 2002) to elicit an effective immune response (Lee et al. 2006). Up to now, a definite conclusion on the best cellular location for optimal immunization, i.e. intracellular, cell wall anchored or secreted, has yet to be reported. This seems to depend on parameters such as the bacterial type, the amount and localization of the antigen, the route of administration, etc. (Wells and Mercenier 2008). Many expression and secretion systems for LAB to deliver protective antigens have already been developed (Kruger et al. 2002; Pusch et al. 2005). Such systems require the use of expression\u2013secretion vectors (ESVs) with a signal peptide (SP) to translocate the protein after synthesis across the bacterial cell membrane. Several SPs have been identified and incorporated into ESVs (Hols et al. 1997; Hazebrouck, Pothelune and Azevedo 2007). The secretion efficiency of different SPs seems to be host specific. For this reason, homologous SPs are thought to drive protein secretion more efficiently than heterologous SPs (Mathiesen et al. 2008). The availability of the complete genome sequences of many Lactobacillus casei strains (Makarova et al. 2006) makes it easy to search for new and efficient SPs that can be used in the construction of new ESVs for this species and maybe other lactobacilli.",

The selected SPs were tested for the secretion of a gene product encoding a green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a reporter protein and using the ESV based on Escherichia coli\u2013L. casei shuttle vectors previously developed in our group (Panya et al. 2012; Suebwongsa et al. 2013). The SP with the highest efficiency was then used to drive the secretion of a synthetic gene coding for an M2e:HBc fusion protein. M2e is a highly conserved protein of the influenza A virus that has been incorporated as an antigen into many influenza vaccine formulations. The immunogenicity of M2e has been reported to be enhanced when fused with the hepatitis B core antigen (HBc) (De Filette et al. 2005). The final construct, pLC-Cwh:M2e:HBc, successfully expressed and secreted the fused antigenic protein.",

SP strength was analyzed using the GFPuv-encoding gene as a reporter. Sequences encoding the three SPs were amplified from genomic DNA of L. casei ATCC334 under the following conditions: one cycle of 95\u00b0C for 3 min; 30 cycles of 95\u00b0C for 30 s, 60\u00b0C for 30 s, 72\u00b0C for 14 s; and 72\u00b0C for 3 min. The lengths of the amplicons, CwhSP, SurASP and SP6565, were 129 bp, 105 bp and 126 bp, respectively. The gfpuv gene fragment, recovered as a KpnI/SpeI-digested fragment from pGFPuv, was cloned into pCwh, pSurA and pSP6565 to generate pCwhSP:GFPuv, pSurSP:GFPuv and pSP6565:GFPuv, respectively. The Cwh:GFPuv fusion gene was obtained by double digestion of the pCwh:GFPuv with HindIII/SpeI and cloned into HindIII/SpeI-digested pLdh-Pro1, a vector containing the constitutive promoter (Pldh) and ribosome binding site (RBSldh) of the lactate dehydrogenase gene (GenBank accession no. D12591.1), resulting in pLdh:Cwh:GFPuv. Using the same procedure, pLdh:Sur:GFPuv and pLdh:SP6565:GFPuv were also obtained. The Ldh:Cwh:GFPuv DNA fragment obtained as a AatII/SpeI-digested pLdh:Cwh:GFPuv was cloned into AatII/SpeI-digested pRCEID-LC13.9 resulting in pLC-Cwh:GFPuv.

            "text": "Engineered LAB strains constitute bacterial systems that may serve as alternative mucosal delivery vehicles for a variety of biomolecules (Wells and Mercenier 2008). Recombinant LAB can be used as vaccine vehicles to elicit both secretory IgA and systemic antibody responses against the delivered antigen (Neutra and Kozlowski 2006). In this study we constructed recombinant L. casei cells expressing M2e:HBc in a secreted form with the use of novel SPs derived from the L. casei genome. Several SPs derived from cell surface-associated proteins and secreted proteins of LAB have been identified and used to construct distinct ESVs (Wu and Chung 2006; Mathiesen et al. 2008). Of these, the SP of Usp45SP from Lactococcus lactis (Daniel et al. 2011) is the most widely used heterologous SP for protein secretion in LAB species (Dieye et al.2001; Mathiesen et al. 2008). Previous studies in Gram-positive bacteria have shown that the secretion efficiency depends not only on the SP but also on the protein to be secreted and on bacterial host (Dieye et al. 2001; Mathiesen et al. 2008). Nonetheless, studies on the SP functionality for heterologous protein secretion in Lactobacillus plantarum WCFS1 found that the homologous SPs have similar or higher secretion efficiencies than those of heterologous origin (Mathiesen et al. 2008). Aimed to express and secrete M2e:HBc in L. casei, we screened for homologous SPs using a bioinformatics approach. In our hands, the best SP predictor is SignalP4.1 (Petersen et al. 2011). This program has been successfully used to select efficient SPs from the protein pool of L. plantarum WCSF1 (Mathiesen et al. 2008). The SubLoc, PSORTb and Gpos-mPLoc programs were also used to predict the localization of the proteins produced. Using these programs, three putative SPs (CwhSP, SurASP and SP6565) were selected from cell surface-associated proteins of L. casei ATCC334 and used for construction of ESVs with GFP as reporter protein. The reason that the SubLoc program predicts CwhSP and SP6565 as periplasmic might be due to the fact that this program uses a dataset based on that of Reinhardt and Hubbard (1998). This dataset contains a small number of sequences of both extracellular and periplasmic groups for training the neural network, which may result in a less accurate prediction. Based on these ESV constructs, it was found that all three SPs can function for GFP secretion in L. casei RCEID02, and that the construct using CwhSP provides the highest GFP secretion. Previous studies found that an efficient signal peptide in Gram-positive bacteria generally contains the consensus sequence Vla-X-Ala\u2193Ala or Ala-X-Ala\u2193Ala as the SP cleavage site (Nielsen et al. 1997; Mathiesen et al. 2008). In this study, all three selected SPs have the consensus motif Val-X-Ala at position \u22123 to \u22121 relative to the putative cleavage site. However, none of the selected SPs contained Ala at position +1. In addition, the most efficient SP, CwhSP, harbors Ser at position +1, which indicates Ala at this position is not required. CwhSP was further used to construct an ESV containing M2e:HBc. Recombinant L. casei carrying this construct expressed and secreted M2e:HBc successfully, demonstrating the usefulness of bioinformatics to predict and select novel SPs for L. casei. However, this approach does not guarantee that the SPs selected will function, since protein secretion depends on the SP itself, the genetic background of the host strain and the target protein. In addition, secretion efficiency may be affected by the extent to which protein production levels and rates are adapted to the capacity of the translocation machinery, the influence of SP sequence on mRNA stability and its translation efficiency (Mathiesen et al. 2008). For these reasons, to maximize the production of a secreted protein in Lactobacillus, and before optimization and balancing of other factors, it might be worthwhile selecting an optimal SP for each individual protein.",

Thus, keeping vaccines up-to-date with influenza A antigens requires constant monitoring of the subtypes of the circulating viruses (Johansson and Brett 2007). This inconvenience has led to much discussion about the development of a universal influenza A vaccine, able to provide protection against all virus subtypes (Du, Zhou and Jiang 2010). Such a vaccine would require identification of a viral component conserved through all subtypes of influenza A virus for eliciting a broad-spectrum immunity (Stanekova and Vareckova 2010). The extracellular domain of the M2 protein (M2e) of the influenza virus is one such conserved component (Ebrahimi and Tebianian 2011). However, this is a short peptide of only 24 amino-acid residues. In this study, the M2e-encoding gene was fused with the gene coding for the hepatitis B core antigen (HBc) protein in order to increase its immunogenicity. In a previous study, strong immunogenicity and full protection were obtained in mice after either intraperitoneal or intranasal administration of the M2e:HBc fusion protein (De Filette et al. 2005). Considering their GRAS status, the use of L. casei as an antigen delivery vehicle can confer great advantage for the expression of the M2e:HBc fusion protein.",
