            "text": "In December 2019, a spate of pneumonia cases of unknown cause was observed in Wuhan, Hubei province, China (\nHe\net al., 2020). Soon after, the causative agent for the novel illness was found to be a novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) (\nLu\net al., 2020;\nZhou\net al., 2020;\nZhu\net al., 2020). Coronaviruses (CoVs), are a large group of viruses that frequently cause mild respiratory disease in humans, including common cold (\nSaif, 2004;\nNIAID, 2020). Hundreds of coronaviruses exist in wild and domestic animals. In the last 20 years, 3 highly infectious CoVs have crossed from animals into humans through spillover events and spread globally, causing severe respiratory illnesses (\nAndersen\net al., 2020;\nCui\net al., 2019). In November 2002, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), a novel respiratory disease emerged in China and rapidly moved to other countries. Its causative agent was identified as a CoV and named SARS-CoV (\nDrosten\net al., 2003;\nFung & Liu, 2019). The SARS mini pandemic infected over 8,000 people and caused almost 800 deaths (\nCherry, 2004). In 2012, a novel respiratory disease, named Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), was identified in Saudi Arabia and the causative agent identified as MERS-CoV (\nde Groot\net al., 2013;\nZaki\net al., 2012). To date, MERS is estimated to have infected over 2,000 people and caused over 700 fatalities (\nRamadan & Shaib, 2019;\nWHO, 2017). In December 2019, a novel respiratory disease presenting with severe unexplained pneumonia emerged in Wuhan, Hubei province - China (\nHuang\net al., 2020;\nZhu\net al., 2020). Its causative agent was quickly identified as a novel CoV (2019-nCoV), which was named SARS-CoV-2 (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2) (\nLu\net al., 2020;\nZhou\net al., 2020). The disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 was named COVID-19 by the WHO (\nWHO, 2020e). COVID-19 then rapidly spread within China, where it infected over 82,000 people and caused more than 3,000 fatalities, mainly in Hubei province (\nWHO, 2020b). The disease\u2019s spread accelerated globally, prompting the WHO to declare it a global pandemic on 11\nth March 2020 (\nBedford\net al., 2020). As of 1\nst April 2020, over 800,000 COVID-19 cases and more than 40,000 COVID-19-associated deaths had been confirmed in 205 countries and territories. Europe and North America are currently the continents most affected by COVID-19. So far, Africa has reported the lowest number of confirmed COVID-19 cases (\nWHO, 2020b). As of writing, 5,999 COVID-19 cases have been reported in Africa with South Africa reporting the highest number. 5 countries (South Africa, Tunisia, Morocco, Egypt, and Algeria) account for close to 65% (3,838 cases) of the confirmed cases, with the remainder being unevenly distributed in the rest of the continent. Within the East African community, there have been a total of 222 confirmed cases (\nAfrican Arguments, 2020;\nWHO, 2020b).",

            "text": "SARS-CoV2, is an enveloped single stranded positive sense RNA virus belonging to the family\nCoronaviridae and genus Betacoronavirus (\nLai\net al., 2020). The SARS-CoV-2 virion ranges between 50-200nm in diameter and houses a 29,881 bp genome (\nChen\net al., 2020a;\nChen\net al., 2020b). Among other genes, the SARS-CoV-2 genome encodes 4 structural proteins named spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N). The N protein holds the viral genome while S, M and E construct the viral envelope, where S mediates viral entry into the host cell (\nWu\net al., 2020). SARS-CoV-2 is easily transmissible. According to the WHO, the main mode of COVID-19 transmission is direct/indirect human-human contact, where the virus is transmitted in respiratory droplets or via contact routes. Droplet transmissions happen when one gets into close proximity, (typically within a meter) with an individual exhibiting respiratory symptoms, such as sneezing or coughing. Indirect transmission may occur when one touches objects handled by an infected individual and then touches their mouth, nose or eyes. Transmission has also been reported to occur via airborne droplet transmission. In such cases, the virus is contained in droplet nuclei, which are typically <5\u00b5m in diameter and can remain airborne for extended periods. Airborne transmission can occur over distances beyond 1 meter but such nuclei are typically generated by processes that generate aerosols, usually patient care procedures (\nWHO, 2020d). As such, social distancing, rigorous hand washing, and avoiding touching the face have been recommended as means of minimizing transmission risk (\nWHO, 2020a). Once SARS-CoV-2 has gained access to the host\u2019s respiratory mucosa, it enters the host cells through an interaction between its S protein and the host cell\u2019s ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) receptors (\nHoffmann\net al., 2020). Unlike other coronaviruses that cause upper respiratory tract disease only, SARS-CoV-2 is capable of colonizing the lower respiratory tract as well (\nHeymann & Shindo, 2020). After infection, the virus incubates for a median period of about 5 days before the onset of symptoms and almost all infections become symptomatic by day 11 (\nLauer\net al., 2020;\nRothan & Byrareddy, 2020). Symptoms include fever, fatigue, headache, dry cough, diarrhea and lymphopenia. While most patients experience mild symptoms that they overcome without need for hospital care, some experience serious complications including severe pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute cardiac injury and acute ground glass opacity (GGO) that may necessitate life support (\nHeymann & Shindo, 2020;\nRothan & Byrareddy, 2020).",

Sample handling should be carried out in a BSL-2 biosafety cabinet under strict adherence to personal protective equipment (PPE) guidelines. However, RT-PCR is labor intensive, severely constraining the capacity for quick turnaround times from sample collection to results transmission. In many contexts, getting results takes days (\nNPR, 2020). As a consequence, laboratory testing of suspect cases is characterized by long wait periods and an exponential increase in demand for tests. To address this bottleneck, rapid diagnostic tests with turnaround times ranging between 10 and 30 minutes have been developed, even though most of these are currently undergoing clinical validation and therefore not in routine use (\nECDC, 2020).",

For instance, aggressive, widespread testing in South Korea early in their epidemic, including the deployment of drive-through testing (\nKwon\net al., 2020) has been credited with effective spread control, avoiding the need for lockdown (\nColbourn, 2020). While in Italy, where medical services were rapidly overwhelmed by a high influx of severe COVID-19 cases, testing was restricted only to those with severe symptoms and needing hospitalization (\nOnder\net al., 2020). This approach misses the vast majority of COVID-19 cases (estimated at around 80%) because they are mild or asymptomatic and tends to overestimate the disease\u2019s fatality rate (\nISPI, 2020). This approach has also been blamed for contributing to the continued spread of COVID-19 as undiagnosed cases drive persistent community transmission (\nPaterlini, 2020). Testing the entire population of the Italian village of Vo\u2019Euganeo, and isolation of all positive cases has been reported to have helped eliminate COVID-19 from the village (\nDay, 2020). Mass testing has been suggested as a means to quickly stop the COVID-19 epidemic in the UK (\nPeto, 2020) and delayed roll out of large-scale testing is considered to have blinded the US to its worsening COVID-19 situation (\nCohen, 2020;\nNew York Times, 2020). In Germany, large-scale testing has been credited for limiting disease spread and the low fatality rate reported by Germany relative to its neighbors (\nFinancial Times, 2020a). While many countries are ramping up surveillance testing, there are no guidelines for large-scale testing and decisions are based on individual countries\u2019 assessments.",

            "text": "A major diagnostic challenge stems from the nature of RT-PCR tests, the gold standard in COVID-19 testing. COVID-19 RT-PCR test kits are expensive, making the cost of large-scale testing prohibitive for LMICs. Additionally, the test requires expensive equipment, including PCR machines and adequately equipped BSL-2 labs. These factors, and the need for highly trained personnel, mean that in most African countries, very few centers have the capacity to run COVID-19 tests. Furthermore, completing a COVID-19 RT-PCR test is a multi-step process that begins with sample collection, often at a point of care that is far away from the country\u2019s test center(s). The sample must then be carefully packaged and transported to the distant testing site under conditions that protect sample integrity. At the lab, laborious sample preparation, including RNA extraction is done, followed by reaction mix preparation and RT-PCR (\nNPR, 2020). This multi-step, labor intensive process results in huge backlogs, severely slowing suspect case testing and limiting capacity for mass testing. While these challenges are global, countries with stronger research capacities have significantly higher test rates as private and academic research institutions help in testing (\nFinancial Times, 2020c). In fact, RT-PCR diagnostic capacity is severely limited in most African countries, with the number of qualified testing labs ranging between 1 and 3 in 40 African countries. To address this shortfall, the WHO-Afro and Africa Task Force for Coronavirus (AFTCOR) are keen to increase this number and bring testing capacity to all 55 African countries (\nNkengasong & Mankoula, 2020). Owing to these challenges, many LMICs governments must prioritize testing of suspect cases and traced contacts. In turn, inadequate testing severely occludes the proper understanding of prevalence and incidence of COVID-19, raising the risk of undetected community spread. Furthermore, a blinded view of COVID-19 means that government responses may not be commensurate with the actual situation. For instance, measures may be relatively weak where stronger measures would have been taken had the actual situation been captured. Likewise, measures may be too stringent in some contexts if identical risk is assumed countrywide in the absence of mass surveillance data. Hence, limited diagnostic capacity blinds governments\u2019 COVID-19 assessments, limiting the country\u2019s abilities to deploy limited resources to maximum effectiveness.",

Consequently, numerous private and public institutions have developed rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) aimed at speeding and expanding testing, crucial factors in the struggle to slow COVID-19 spread. RDTs, which are largely based on immunoassays, may be direct, through detection of SARS-CoV-2 antigens or indirect, through detection of anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibodies (\nECDC, 2020). Advantages of RDTs include ease of use as they do not require special equipment or highly trained personnel and stability at room temperature, removing the need for constant refrigeration/freezing. RDTs are therefore highly suited for point of care diagnosis (POCD) and are highly amenable to deployment in low resource settings, removing the need for sample transportation. Several COVID-19 RDTs, capable of giving results in 10-30 minutes are now commercially available or in development (\nECDC, 2020). In many African contexts, RDTs would reduce the time needed to get test results from days to minutes. Therefore, RDTs offer a means to aggressively deploy mass testing across Africa.

            "text": "Different strategies exist for point of care testing, all with inherent merits and demerits: 1) Use of antibody testing. As the body mounts an immune response, antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 antigens are generated. These antibodies may serve as indicators of infection. However, since detectable antibodies may lag behind the appearance of clinical symptoms, most infections will be missed, causing a high rate of false negatives. Conversely, persistence of antibodies after virus elimination from the body may result in a high rate of false positives. Moreover, a high cross reactivity of SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV S protein against plasma samples from 15 patients has been observed, which may impact test interpretation (\nLv\net al., 2020). However, in spite of these drawbacks, antibody tests will still be useful in community surveillance of exposed populations and this information will be useful in determining the extent of \u2018herd\u2019 immunity and guide tailored public health interventions. 2) Antigen point of care tests overcome the problems inherent in antibody tests by showing evidence of viral proteins, thereby indicating ongoing virus infection. However, such tests will not be as sensitive as to RT-PCR and their clinical utility is yet to be determined, especially in the context of other CoVs. Several of these tests, for example Spike Dart from E25Bio (\nThe Boston Globe, 2020), are currently under evaluation for FDA approval. In Europe, antibody and antigen tests are now commercially available (\nECDC, 2020). 3) Molecular based testing based on isothermal amplification such as RT-LAMP and CRISPR based SHERLOCK (Specific High Sensitivity Enzymatic Reporter UnLOCKing) (\nKellner\net al., 2019;\nZhang\net al., 2020) have the potential for bridging the gaps left by antibody based tests but pose unique challenges for field deployment. These require heating, reagents that may need a cold chain and some degree of sample preparation. Past experiences with LAMP, which has been used for malaria, TB and several other infectious diseases demonstrate that important implementation bottlenecks need to be overcome to move these from research settings to routine use. The GeneXpert platform based Xpert\u00ae Xpress SARS-CoV-2 test by Cepheid, has received emergency use approval by the FDA (\nCepheid, 2020). Fortunately, this platform has widespread use for TB diagnosis in Africa and repurposing it for COVID-19 will fast track testing. However, supply chain management challenges previously experienced during TB testing will need to be overcome for meaningful operation.",

However, as the pandemic evolves, it is increasingly important to develop point of care tests that will facilitate proper last mile epidemiology, inform treatment and public health interventions. These POC tests will leverage available molecular platforms such as CRISPR, or be based on antigen or antibody detection. Critically, it should be understood that these strategies have inherent merits and demerits and synergy will only be achieved where all are used appropriately. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for development and growth of in-continent POC diagnostics development capacity ranging from assay development, device fabrication, prototyping, validation, implementation research and entrepreneurial ecosystems including venture capitalization and regulation.",
