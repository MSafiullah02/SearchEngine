At baseline, 100% (71/71) of the participants shed virus, with median virus concentration 3.5 log 10 TCID 50 per mL extraction fluid (equivalently, 10 3.5 TCID 50 /mL), and range [0.5, 6.6 log 10 TCID 50 /mL]. To these log 10 concentration data, I fit a Normal distribution, equating the reported median with the distribution mean. I assumed the reported range equaled the 5th and 95th percentiles of the distribution (z = \u00b11.645), and took the standard deviation of the distribution to be equal to the mean value of the estimates from each tail s = 1.56 log 10 TCID 50 /mL (CV = 45%). The next day, 85% (60/71) participants shed virus with median virus concentration 2.3 log 10 TCID 50 /mL, and range [0.0. 5.5 log 10 TCID 50 /mL]. The Normal distribution parameters were estimated as previously, such that s = 1.40 log 10 TCID 50 /mL (CV = 61%). I could find no data relating swab sample concentrations to virus concentrations in respiratory secretions, so I accounted for dilution to 3 mL during sample extraction I added log 10 3 (0.48) to the mean log 10 concentrations, and adjusted the standard deviations to maintain the CV. The resulting probability distributions of infectious influenza in respiratory secretions are: Normal (\u00b5 = 3.98, \u03c3 = 1.77 log 10 TCID 50 /mL) at baseline, and Normal (\u00b5 = 2.78, \u03c3 = 1.69 log 10 TCID 50 /mL) at day 1.",

Among 16 outpatients who presented on symptom days 1-2 with influenza A infections, the mean influenza virus concentration in nasal wash specimens was 4.51 (s = 1.67) log 10 RNA copies/mL. (5) Nasal washing has been found to dilute rhinovirus concentrations approximately one order of magnitude relative to the concentration in the nasal fluid. (6) The number of influenza A and B (PR 8 and Lee strains) per TCID 50 has been found to range 10 2 -10 4 , such that, on average, influenza genomes are 1,000 times more numerous than TCID 50 . (7, 8) Therefore I added 1 to the reported log 10 concentrations to account for dilution, and subtracted 3 to account for the number of genomes per log 10 TCID 50 to give log 10 TCID 50 per mL of respiratory secretions; and adjusted the standard deviation to maintain the same coefficient of variation. The resulting probability distributions of influenza log 10 TCID 50 in respiratory secretions are: Normal (\u00b5 = 4.30, \u03c3 = 0.93 log 10 TCID 50 /mL), Normal (\u00b5 = 3.84, \u03c3 = 0.74 log 10 TCID 50 /mL), Normal (\u00b5 = 2.50, \u03c3 = 1.03 log 10 TCID 50 /mL), and Normal (\u00b5 = 2.54, \u03c3 = 1.17 log 10 TCID 50 /mL) at symptom days 1-4, respectively, for hospitalized patients; and Normal (\u00b5 = 2.51, \u03c3 = 1.93 log 10 TCID 50 /mL) for outpatients.",
