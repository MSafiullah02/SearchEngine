In China, Sina Weibo and Tencent Weibo were the two largest social media platforms with more than 300 million users when the outbreak occurred [8]. Weibo is the Chinese word for microblog and allows a 140-character limit. The Internet users who post on \u201cWeibo\u201d are known as microbloggers. Driven by the popularity of such platforms, the outbreak triggered great public concern, with over 850,000 posts related to the term of \u201cH7N9\u201d generated in Sina Weibo [5]. With the function of self-expression and networking, social media provides a fertile ground for unreliable information generation and circulation [6,9,10]. One study showed that 57% of the rumors about the tragedy of Malaysia Airlines MH370 were generated from social media platforms in China [11]. Such misinformation or rumors could lead to great confusion and pose challenges to the disease control [7,12]. The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2003 serves as a typical example where rumors stirred great panic in Chinese society and made it hard for disease prevention and control [7,13].",

Due to the poultry origin, a kind of Chinese traditional food\u2014Chicken feet with pickled pepper\u2014sparked microbloggers\u2019 discussion about its causal relationship with the avian influenza. Chicken feet with pickled pepper (known as Pao-jiao-feng-zhua in Chinese) is a popular food item widely loved by Chinese people. The chicken feet are boiled for about 20 min and pickled with peppers for 2 days or longer. Although the avian-origin influenza A (H7N9) virus exists in the live poultry, the virus is sensitive to heat and cannot survive in the boiling water for 2 min [14,15]. Therefore, the virus has no chance of survival during the production process of the chicken feet with pepper. However, the topic on the relationship between the 2 items was widely discussed. Many microbloggers released messages that misunderstood the causal relationship between the 2 counterparts, and their posts became very prevalent [16-18]. The false messages claiming that chicken feet with pepper would cause H7N9 influenza were identified as rumors and caused great confusion and panic during the outbreak [17].",

If the microbloggers asked rhetorical questions or the question was answered by themselves in the same posts, such posts were not included in this category. Misleading messages referred to posts claiming that influenza A (H7N9) was caused by chicken feet with pickled peppers or to the posts persuading other people to believe the incorrect statement. Refuting messages included posts that stated that there was no causal relationship between the 2 counterparts and posts that corrected the false information or reminded the readers not to believe the wrong messages. Other messages represented posts that could not be classified into the categories above. The posts in this category have not mentioned the relationship between eating chicken feet with pickled pepper and H7N9 avian influenza, or the information is too limited to be judged.",

The microbloggers who posted \u201crefuting messages\u201d were recognized as active on social media because they had most followers and previous posts among the 4 groups. However, their correcting posts received fewer reposts as well as the least reposts. This fact suggests the need to empower these kinds of messages to strengthen the self-purification function of social media [11,28,29]. The queries and other messages received more comments than the other 2 groups. These 2 groups of posts contained more content of questions and jokes, which we think were more interactive [31]. Thus, they received more replies than the other 2 groups of posts.",
