Common presenting signs include incoordination, ataxia, head tilt, star-gazing, and or opisthotonus. Characteristic gross lesions include nodular thickening of the bones of the skull, osseous tentorium cerebelli, and dorsal arch of the atlas with narrowing of the foramen magnum, secondary cerebellar herniation, and dilation of the ventricles and central canal of the spinal cord (Figs. 10.3A and B). Affected lions may have compression of the anterior spinal cord. Histologically, bone is thickened, with large, irregular islands of fibrocartilage and woven bone with retained cartilage cores. Osteoclasts are only rarely noted. In the brain and spinal cord, there is histologic evidence of hemorrhage, rarefaction and thinning of the cerebellar folia with loss of all cell layers, and gliosis. Wallerian degeneration is most prominent in the cervical spinal cord. Leptomeninges are often thickened by fibrous connective tissue.",

Similar lesions have also been documented in other species with Vitamin A deficiency although lesions have not been reproduced in domestic cats (Gershoff et al., 1957) and the pathogenesis is not well understood. In hypovitaminosis A, bone production occurs at sites of normal resorption and the paucity of osteoclasts within lesions suggests a potential link though the role of vitamin A in bone development and maintenance is not completely understood. Treatment in many clinical cases has been unrewarding although improvement has been noted in mild cases given excessive Vitamin A supplementation and in other cases following surgical reduction of bone (Shamir et al., 2008, McCain et al., 2008). Whether the poor response to replacement therapy is due to the chronicity of lesions or alternative pathogenesis is uncertain. Many affected lions are fed diets similar to those of other captive felids that do not develop these lesions. Many reports include multiple cubs from the same litter suggesting genetics may contribute. A separate myelopathy associated with hypovitaminosis A with diffuse spinal cord white matter degeneration in the absence of bone lesions has been diagnosed in a captive lion (Maratea et al., 2006).",

Ostium secundum atrial septal defects have been diagnosed in up to 18% of panthers (Cunningham et al., 1999, Buergelt et al., 2002) and are thought to have been the cause of death in 9% of studied animals.

Ocular colobomas are defects in one or more structures of the eye. Those that occur in the eyelids, cornea, iris, ciliary body, choroid, retina and/or optic disc result from failure of the embryonic fissure to close correctly during embryogenesis (Gripenberg et al. 1985; Barnett & Lewis 2002). A similar suite of lesions has also been described in a captive Texas cougar (Cutler, 2002). To date, there are no reports of the condition in free-ranging snow leopards. In all cases, unilateral or bilateral eyelid colobomas with agenesis of a small to extensive region (typically the lateral and/or central areas) of the upper lid/s occurs (Fig. 10.4\n) and appears as an area in which there is direct transition from the periocular skin to the bulbar conjunctiva. Other lesions include microphthalmia or anophthalmia, and choroidal or optic nerve colobomas. Persistent pupillary membranes, slender, pigmented, fibrovascular strands of remnant fetal membranes that extend from the iris to the anterior lens capsule, posterior surface of the cornea, or other parts of the iris, are relatively common concurrent lesions. Histologic lesions include choroid hypoplasia, retinal cysts, retinal dysplasia (retinal folds), and cupping or cystic ectasia of the optic nerve. Multiple hypotheses have been proposed but to date none have been proven (Gripenberg et al. 1985; Esson 2001; Barnett & Lewis 2002).",

The spectrum of lesions varies from small bone spurs on the lateral or ventral edges of the articular surfaces of vertebral bodies to large, boney bridges or callus-like proliferations of bone between adjacent vertebral bodies and sclerosis of vertebral end plates (Fig. 10.5\n). Primary factors important in its development include intervertebral disc degeneration, disc herniation and intervertebral space collapse, and degeneration of the articular facets of the vertebral bodies. Affected animals may be asymptomatic or show decreased activity, weakness, ataxia, proprioceptive deficits or paresis. While lesions can occur anywhere along the vertebral column, those in the lumbar spine and lumbosacral junction are most common. Axonal damage and Wallerian degeneration in the spinal cord are associated with disc herniation and compression but can be due to osteophyte formation, and compressive lesions may occur in spinal nerves due to bone expansion.",

Glomerular basement membranes have increased amounts of laminin, fibronectin and type IV collagen, even in the early stages. Ultrastructurally, in addition to thickened basement membranes, foot processes are effaced in some cases and electron-dense deposits compatible with immune complexes are present in the intramembranous spaces. Positive immunogold staining for IgM and IgG but not IgA are present in these complexes. In addition to glomerular lesions, interstitial lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates are present and increase with severity of the glomerular lesions. Interstitial fibrosis is also noted in more severe cases. Proteinuria and low urine specific gravity, consistent with renal dysfunction, as well as azotemia and hyperphosphatemia are seen in some cases.

Disease is characterized by progressive accumulation of collagen in perisinusoidal spaces (space of Disse) and subintimal spaces of central and sublobular veins. The result is progressive attenuation or obliteration of vascular lumens with collapse of regional cords, atrophy and loss of hepatocytes surrounding affected vessels and subsequent fibrosis (Fig. 10.6A and B). Subendothelial damage, thought to be the primary lesion, is evident ultrastructurally. Chronic cases can progress to cirrhosis. In severe acute cases, centrilobular to massive hepatic necrosis with hemorrhagecan be seen. Clinically, affected cats can be asymptomatic or have signs of hepatic failure including hypoproteinemia, serous or chylous abdominal effusion, elevated liver enzymes (aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase), and icterus (Terrell et al., 2003). In rare cases, cheetahs have exhibited neurologic signs presumably due to hepatic encephalopathy. A dietary cause for VOD, including phytoestrogens (a cause of the disease in humans) or elevated dietary Vitamin A, has been proposed but not proven (Setchell et al., 1987, Gosselin et al., 1988). The diagnosis of VOD in a few wild cheetahs seems to refute the hypothesis that captive diets are causative (Munson et al., 2005).",

These amyloid deposits contain full serum amyloid A (SAA) protein as well as fragmented AA protein (Bergstr\u00f6m et al., 2006, Johnson et al., 1997). Unlike black-footed cats, concurrent inflammation, commonly gastritis, is common in cheetahs; however, not all not all cheetahs with inflammation develop amyloidosis. The amino acid sequence of the cheetah AA protein is similar to the sequence in domestic cat breeds with familial amyloidosis, suggesting a structural predisposition and genetic component to disease pathogenesis. Additionally, single nucleotide polymorphisms have been identified in genes regulating transcription of SAA1 suggesting a possible genetic role in increased production of SAA (Zhang et al., 2008b). Different alleles of this gene have been associated with differing SAA serum concentrations in cheetahs but no significant allelic difference has been identified in the presence or absence of amyloidosis in tissues at necropsy (Franklin et al, 2016). Furthermore, if amyloidosis was solely due to a genetic predisposition, we would expect to find amyloidosis in free-ranging cheetahs. To date, this has not been documented (Munson et al., 2005; Terio, Mitchell unpublished) suggesting that disease development is multi-factorial. In some species, AA amyloidosis is thought to be transmissible and AA fibrils have been identified in cheetah feces (Zhang et al., 2008a). Epidemiological studies of amyloidosis in captive cheetahs that control for concurrent inflammation have not found evidence of amyloid transmission in captive North American facilities (McLean et al., 2015).",

The presence of advanced glycosylation end products within glomerular basement membranes of cheetahs parallels lesions in diabetic nephropathy of humans; however, affected cheetahs are generally not diabetic. As the lesions are similar to old rat nephropathy which is linked in some rat strains to high protein diets, the large proportion of skeletal meat in the diet of captive cheetahs (in contrast to wild cheetahs that eat more of the whole carcass) may contribute to disease predisposition in captivity. A genetic predisposition is possible but unlikely since wild cheetahs, which share the species\u2019 renowned homogeneity (O\u2019Brien et al. 1985), generally lack these lesions. Stress-induced hypercorticoidism with subsequent hyperglycemia and or glomerular hypertension with capillary basement membrane damage has also been proposed (Bolton and Munson, 1999, Terio et al., 2004).",

Histologically, characteristic birefringent crystals forming rosettes are present in renal tubules and associated with epithelial necrosis, tubular dilation and cellular casts. In more chronic cases, there may be tubular regeneration. Crystals are positive for calcium and in some cases basement membranes are mineralized. Ethylene glycol toxicosis has been suspected in some cases but never proven and cases have occurred in areas of the world that do not use antifreeze. Additionally, approximately 10% of the North American and South African captive cheetah populations have histologically evident oxalate crystals at the time of death, making widespread toxicity unlikely. In cheetahs, there is no association between risk factors such as concurrent renal disease (amyloidosis, glomerulosclerosis, interstitial nephritis) or gastritis and the severity of oxalate nephrosis.

At necropsy, lesions included bilateral cavitation within the white matter of the centrum semiovale and corona radiata as well as hydrocephalus. Histologically, there were numerous reactive astrocytes, myelin vacuolation and degeneration, and cavitation. The cause of leukoencephalopathy has not been determined. Given the lesions, lack of viral evidence, and epidemiology of the outbreak, exposure of cheetahs to some common neurotoxin through feed, pharmaceuticals or vaccines was considered the most likely cause.

It is characterized grossly by mild to marked expansion of the endometrium with or without macroscopic cyst formation. Histologically, there is proliferation of endometrial glands with adenomatous projections (adenomatous hyperplasia), dilated cystic glands (cystic hyperplasia), or expansion of the endometrium by irregular folds and/or polypoid projections. Hyperplastic glands are lined by crowded, densely packed, well-differentiated cuboidal to columnar epithelial cells that are asynchronous with the estrous cycle stage. In cystic glands, epithelial cells may be attenuated. In more severe cases, there may also be endometrial fibrosis and endometrial or stromal mineralization. Hyperplasia develops earlier and is significantly more common in MGA-treated animals; risk is increased with increased treatment duration (>72 months). In addition to MGA treatment, age is an additional risk factor while parity is associated with decreased risk. The pathogenesis of MGA-associated EH is unclear; however, exposure of estrogen primed endometrium to prolonged progestins, the latter inducing secretory differentiation of epithelial cells, is suspected.",

A few tumors of particular note based on species predilections are noted here; additional information on the pathogenesis of these and other common neoplasms is available in the Supplemental Materials. Splenic myelolipomas occur in both captive and wild cheetahs. They commonly present as multiple, variable sized masses composed of mature adipose with varying amounts of hematopoietic cells (Fig. 10.9\n). These masses may be mistaken for more nefarious tumors on ultrasound but are incidental and benign. Benign and malignant biliary tumors are common in many of the large cats. Depending on the extent of parenchyma affected, animals may have associated clinical signs of hepatic dysfunction. Tumors that are generally uncommon in cats but have species predilections include transitional cell carcinomas in fishing cats, pheochromocytomas in clouded leopards, and ovarian carcinomas in jaguars (Fig. 10.10\nA and B). Snow leopards can develop squamous cell carcinomas associated with papillomavirus infection (see below). Reproductive tract leiomyomas are common in older female felids and can predispose to other complications such as hydrometra and pyometra. Uterine and mammary carcinomas have been associated with the use of progestin-based contraceptives (e.g. MGA).\n",

More severe upper respiratory tract disease with corneal ulcers and/or keratitis have been noted in both Pallas\u2019 cats and cheetahs.

Skin lesions have not been noted in wild cheetahs despite evidence of seropositivity (Munson et al., 2004a, Munson et al., 2005, Thalwitzer et al., 2010) but have been documented in wild-caught captive-held cats (Flacke et al., 2015). Lesions present as ulceration and often plaque like proliferative lesions on the face and/or forelimbs, or sites in contact with lacrimal (tear) and salivary gland secretions (Fig. 10.11\nA). Biopsy is essential to rule out neoplasia. Histologically, there are dense dermal infiltrates of eosinophils, plasma cells and mast cells.

In these studies, cheetah PBM as a group had significantly lower proliferative responses than domestic cats to FHV-1, although individual responses varied widely. Interestingly, the cheetah PBM responses improved when they were first cultured with interleukin-2 (IL-2), a TH-1 cytokine critical to an effective cell-mediated immune response. Other studies have found low levels of IL-2 in captive cheetahs as opposed to wild counterparts suggesting that ineffective immune responses may play a role in disease susceptibility (Terio et al., 2014).",

Once infected, whether there is cat to cat spread is uncertain, though models predict that lions may be able to sustain an epidemic due to their social nature (Craft et al., 2009).",

All wild felid populations tested to date have some degree of seropositivity, suggesting that exposure and infection is widespread (Munson et al., 2010). Analysis of multiple sites on the CDV-H gene which encodes the hemagglutinin protein important for binding to host receptors have found no consistent amino acid sequence to identify those strains that infect felids (Terio and Craft, 2013). Additional research is needed to better understand CDV infection dynamics in felids as well as the ecology of disease spread in multi-host ecosystems.",

In 1983 an epidemic of FIP in a captive cheetah population caused > 60% mortality (Evermann et al., 1988, Heeney et al., 1990). It was hypothesized that lack of heterogeneity at MHC loci encoding peptides that mediate immune responses to pathogens (O\u2019Brien et al., 1985) was an important factor in the high mortality rate. However, subsequent studies and comparison with data from wild cheetah populations that also lack MHC heterogeneity suggest that extrinsic environmental factors and possibly stress may also be significant in disease pathogenesis (Munson et al., 2005, Terio et al., 2004).",

Virus is shed through aerozolized respiratory secretions and feces. In 2003-2004, captive clouded leopards, leopard cats and tigers died of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 after being fed infected chicken and quail (Keawcharoen et al., 2004). In one zoo, there was evidence of tiger to tiger viral spread (Thanawongnuwech et al., 2005). Additional cases of H5N1 in captive tigers have occurred in subsequent outbreaks (He et al., 2015, Hu et al., 2016). Clinical signs in affected felids are primarily high fever and respiratory distress. Lesions at gross necropsy have included pulmonary consolidation and hemorrhage with tracheal and bronchial exudates. Histologically, cats have pulmonary hemorrhage, edema and necrosis of alveolar walls as well as meningoencephalitis and necrotizing hepatitis. The impact of influenza viruses on wild populations of felids is unknown. In addition to H5N1 viruses, non-fatal H1N1 viruses have been recovered from cheetahs with clinical respiratory signs (Crossley et al., 2012).",

Only a single case of FIV-associated lymphoma has been described (Poli et al., 1995).

Disease has been described in free-ranging African lions, leopards, cheetah, Iberian lynx, and bobcat (Keet et al 1996;\nBriones et al., 2000, Bruning-Fann et al., 2001, P\u00e9rez et al., 2001, Aranaz et al., 2004, Cleaveland et al., 2005; Kirberger et al., 2006;\nSchmidbauer et al., 2007, Michel et al., 2009, Martinez et al., 2013, Miller et al., 2015). Wild African lions, leopard and cheetah are affected with the same spoligotype and variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) genotypes isolated from sympatric buffalo, while free-ranging lynx in Spain are infected with spoligotypes identical to those in cattle, wild boar and fallow deer. These findings suggest that cats are infected from prey. Free-ranging cheetahs, leopards and lynx are considered spillover hosts, but lions may be able to serve as maintenance hosts. The long-term effects of bTB on free-ranging lion populations is uncertain (Cleaveland et al., 2005, Ferreira and Funston, 2010, Viljoen et al., 2015). Seroconversion of necropsy staff and keepers has been reported, emphasizing the importance of appropriate personal protective equipment (Helman et al., 1998, Morris et al., 1996, Watering et al., 1972).",

External findings include emaciation, decubital ulcers, cutaneous alopecia, corneal opacity, poorly healed bite wounds, and elbow and hock hygromas (Figs. 10.15\nA, B). Internally, there can be localized or systemic granulomatous inflammation within the lung (Fig. 10.16\nA) and lymph nodes or other sites such as the spleen, kidney, eye or adrenal glands. Pulmonary cavitations (<4cm diameter) caused by bronchiectasis with luminal mucus are most common in the diaphragmatic lung lobes. These lesions can rupture and result in pneumothorax as well as hydrothorax and pleural adhesions. Arthritis and proliferative osteitis are other common findings. Histologically, granulomas, multinucleate giant cells, necrosis and mineralization are rare. Rather there are expansile, non-encapsulated aggregates of macrophages, epithelioid cells, lymphocytes, plasma cells and neutrophils along bronchioles and in alveolar walls (Fig. 10.16B). While acid-fast bacteria may be numerous in airways, lung and joint exudates, bacteria are rare in pulmonary macrophages (Fig. 10.16C). Lymphoid atrophy is common. Granulomatous lymphadenitis, panophthalmitis, choroiditis, uveitis, conjunctivitis (with or without retinal detachment), pleuritis, mural enteritis and renal medullary amyloidosis may be present, and osteomyelitis, myositis and periostitis may be accompanied by secondary hypertrophic osteoarthropathy. Granulomatous arthritis may be associated with joint capsule mineralization and ossified fragments in the joint space (Keet et al., 1996, Kirberger et al., 2006).",

The toxin complex consists of two separate protein components (edema and lethal toxins) and their shared cell receptor binding protein (protective antigen). Severe edema at the site of entry and draining lymph nodes is caused by the edema toxin and is modulated by macrophage production of cytokines including interleukin-1 (IL-1), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1), IL-6 and IL-8; while lethal toxin inactivates mitogen-activated protein kinases and inhibits IL-1\u03b2 expression with resultant cell necrosis, reduced phagocytosis and altered blood clotting.

Helicobacter sp. are generally an incidental finding with only rare individual cases of gastritis reported in most felid species (Schroder et al., 1998). The exception are cheetah in which the majority (>95%) of captive cheetah have associated lymphoplasmacytic gastritis (Eaton et al., 1993; Munson, 1993). Grossly, stomachs are thickened with a reddened cobblestone appearance; some cases have loss of rugae and atrophy (Fig. 10.18\nA). Histologically, there are large numbers of lymphocytes and plasma cells within the lamina propria as well as intraepithelial (CD3+CD8\u03b1+) T cells (Fig. 10.18B). Severe cases are characterized by large numbers (>70%) of lamina proprial activated B (CD79a+ CD21-) and plasma cells (Terio et al., 2012). Some lymphoid aggregates along the base of the lamina propria have follicular differentiation and mucosal atrophy is present in some cases. Clinical signs in cheetahs range from weight loss to chronic vomiting and regurgitation; in rare cases, cheetahs are euthanized due to chronic gastritis. Cheetahs with gastritis can develop secondary amyloidosis (Papendick et al., 1997). Wild cheetahs are also infected with Helicobacter sp. and the types of Helicobacter are similar to those in captive cheetahs suggesting that bacteria alone do not cause disease and that host factors are important in disease development (Terio et al., 2005,\n2014).",

Inhalation of infectious basidiospores may be common in cheetahs because of their habit of using play trees and aerosolizing the organism through slapping the ground with their forelimbs when threatened. The outcome of infection depends on host immune status, fungal virulence factors including capsule thickness, and the capacity to combat host oxidative processes (Lester et al., 2011). While the predisposition of the king cheetah coat variant to clinical disease suggests an inherited susceptibility in this subtype (Berry et al., 1997, Bolton et al., 1999, Picard et al., 1998), neither the limited genetic variation of the cheetah nor underlying viral infections are predisposing (Miller-Edge and Worley,1992;\nMillward and Williams, 2005). The role of chronic stress in captive cheetahs (Terio et al., 2004) in the susceptibility to this disease is uncertain.",

Prion protein (PNRP) sequences are similar among cheetahs and other felids that lack evidence of disease, such as mountain lions who prey upon deer and elk affected by chronic wasting disease (CWD), suggesting that spongiform encephalopathy in cheetah is not due to a genetic susceptibility (Stewart et al., 2012).

            "text": "\nLeiomyomas and leiomyosarcomas are benign and malignant smooth muscle tumors, respectively. They can originate in smooth muscle anywhere in the body. In zoo felids, they appear to be relatively common in the female genital tract (Fig. e2\n) (Chassy et al., 2002). Leiomyomas have been diagnosed more common in large cats than small cats, which may reflect true incidence or collection bias. Tumors occur more commonly in the uterus than in the ovary or broad ligament; leiomyomas can also occur in the cervix. Tumors may be single or multiple and appear grossly as expansile or pedunculated, fleshy to firm, light pink/tan to tan/white masses. In the uterus, they appear to originate more commonly from the intramyometrial smooth muscle than from subserosal or subendometrial smooth muscle. Tumors are often well-demarcated but can blend with adjacent normal tissue or have edges that vary from being well to poorly defined but they are not invasive. Leiomyomas are composed of dense, interwoven bundles and fascicles of well-differentiated, elongate cells with moderate amounts of fibrillar, eosinophilic cytoplasm, and oval to elongate, normochromatic, vesicular nuclei with a single nucleolus. Mitoses are typically absent or rare (<1 per 10 high power field). Tumoral necrosis may be present but inflammation is uncommon and metastasis has not been described. Leiomyosarcomas are less common in zoo felids than leiomyomas. They are poorly demarcated, invasive, firm, multilobulated masses that often replace normal architecture. Cells have mild to moderate cellular pleomorphism with anisocytosis, anisokaryosis, occasional multinucleation, and one to a few nucleoli. Mitosis are much higher than in leiomyomas and are often common (several to over 20 per 10 high power fields). Tumor necrosis and inflammation are more common in leiomyosarcomas than in leiomyomas, and foci of tumoral mineralization, ossification, and local or distant metastasis may be present. Immunohistochemical labeling is useful in differentiating leiomyomas and leiomyosarcomas from other mesenchymal tumors, and will be positive for vimentin, smooth muscle actin, and/or desmin though labeling with the smooth muscle specific markers may be less common in leiomyosarcomas than leiomyomas. Possible complications of either tumor include obstruction along the reproductive tract and in leiomyosarcomas, adhesions between the tumor and adjacent structures due to invasive growth (Chassy et al., 2002, Siegal-Willott et al., 2005). Progestin contraception, in particular long-term treatment with melengestrol acetate (MGA) has been associated with mammary gland carcinogenesis in zoo felids (Harrenstien et al., 1996, McAloose et al., 2007). In a review of the reproductive histories of 52 zoo felids with uterine leiomyomas, there was no association between progestin contraception and tumor presence; in five zoo felids with leiomyosarcoma, four had been treated with MGA; however, an association between the two was not significant and further investigation was deemed necessary (Chassy et al., 2002).",

Mean age in affected cats is 10.8 years and no sex predilection has been noted. Both captive bred and wild-caught captive held cats have developed these tumors. However, it is unknown if this disease occurs in wild fishing cats. Tumors commonly develop in the trigone region of the bladder. Histologically, lesions are primarily mural, although exophytic papillary proliferation does occur in about half of the cases (Landolfi and Terio, 2006). Carcinoma in situ occurs in, presumably, early lesions. Invasive portions of the neoplasms express cyclo-oxygenase 2 (COX-2) and therefore treatment with COX-2 inhibitors may slow disease progression (Landolfi and Terio, 2006). A dietary component to the pathogenesis has been suspected because in captivity cats had commonly been fed commercial carnivore diets consisting primarily of beef with little fish. Nutritional studies did find significantly increased levels of saturated fatty acids in cats with TCC compared to cats without tumors (Marshal et al., 2012). As some of these fatty acids are correlated with TCC in humans, recommendations have been made to decrease beef and increase fish content of captive diets.",

This tumor is a significant cause of mortality in captive female jaguars affecting breeding age as well as geriatric cats but its prevalence in wild jaguars is unknown (Hope and Deem, 2006). Diagnosis is common at necropsy. Affected jaguars will have multiple, variably sized cystic masses many of which are bilateral with spread along the uterine horns and abdominal carcinomatosis. Histologically, tumors are composed of papillary projections lined by neoplastic polygonal cells overlying a thin connective tissue stroma. Cysts formed by neoplastic cells contain proteinic fluid and or hemorrhage. An important differential is peritoneal mesothelioma and immunohistochemical studies are underway to provide markers to characterize ovarian tumors in jaguars (S. Corner, personal communication). In jaguars, the occurrence of this tumor has not been correlated with progestin (melengestrol acetate, MGA) contraception (Kazensky et al., 1998). Interestingly, jaguars also have a high prevalence of mammary cancer (Bryan et al., 2015, Munson, 1994), suggesting that abnormalities in genes, such as BRCA may be important in the pathogenesis.\n",

Regardless of morphologic pattern, tumors are typically multinodular to multilobular with scant to small amounts of fibrous or fibrovascular stroma although moderate intertubular stroma may be seen in tubular patterns. Focal to multifocal inflammation, typically lymphoplasmacytic, neutrophilic, or mixed, can be seen though is not a consistent finding; necrosis may also be present but is not as common as intratubular necrotic cellular debris.",

In general, most MG carcinomas in zoo felids are moderately to poorly differentiated and of high grade based on the percentage of tubule formation, mitotic count and nuclear morphology [using criteria of Elston and Ellis (Elston and Ellis, 1991)]. Metastasis is common and most often to local and distant lymph nodes, lung, and liver. As occurs in domestic cats, MG carcinomas in zoo felids are more commonly positive for progesterone receptors than for estrogen receptors, though testing has only been performed on a handful of animals (McAloose et al., 2007).",

            "text": "While MG carcinomas occur spontaneously, a significant increase in incidence is seen in zoo felids on continuous, long-term (> 3 years) melengestrol acetate (MGA) contraception (Harrenstien et al., 1996). Use of this potent synthetic progestin in implant form (subcutaneous or intramuscular) began in the 1970s and continued until concerns about its association with mammary and uterine cancers and cystic endometrial hyperplasia arose in the 1990s (Harrenstien et al., 1996, Munson et al., 1995, Munson et al., 2002). Though not completely worked out, concurrent exposure to estrogen and this potent progestin is suspected as a predisposing factor in MGA-associated MG carcinogenesis. Felids are seasonally polyestrous and typically ovulate only if bred (induced ovulators). When not bred, they are exposed to recurrent peaks of estrogen as waves of follicles develop and then undergo atresia (Munson and Moresco, 2007). Because MGA does not suppress ovulation (Kazensky et al., 1998), treated cats are likely exposed to concurrent intermittent high levels of estrogen (during folliculogenesis) and this potent progestin. In women, dogs, and cats, cumulative endogenous and exogenous steroid hormone exposure are risk factors in MG carcinogenesis (Munson and Moresco, 2007). This combination is also suspected as a predisposing factor in carcinogenesis in zoo felids as estrogen and progesterone promote MG interlobular duct and lobuloalveolar growth, respectively (McAloose et al., 2007). Interestingly, there are no significant differences in spontaneous and MGA-associated MG cancers including the age of development, morphology, grade, or occurrence of metastasis. In either group, MG cancer may be associated with hypercalcemia or anemia.",
