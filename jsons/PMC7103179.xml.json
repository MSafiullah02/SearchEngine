Swine flu is a variant of the H1N1 virus whose transmission can occur through human contact with animals or contaminated objects and from man to man. This virus was originally called \u201cswine flu\u201d because laboratory tests showed that several of its genes were very similar to the influenza virus that usually affects pigs in North America. Further studies showed that many genes of this new virus were quite different from those that normally circulate in pigs from North America. H1N1 has two genes of influenza viruses circulating in pigs in Europe and Asia and also genes of avian and human influenza. Scientists call it \u201cthe quadruple recombinant virus.\u201d",

Cases of novel influenza A (H1N1) virus infection have included rapidly progressive lower respiratory tract disease resulting in respiratory failure, development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and prolonged intensive care unit admission [2].",

In the same way, it is believed that people with rheumatic diseases using immunobiologic agents could be included in the risk group. TNF-alpha inhibitors are indicated to psoriatic arthritis (PsA) patients who do not respond or cannot tolerate common DMARDs, methotrexate or leflunomide. The three currently available TNF-\u03b1 inhibitors in Brazil are etanercept, infliximab, and adalimumab.

The H5N1/97 and H5N1/04 subtype influenza A viruses are more potent inducers of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines in primary human respiratory epithelial cells than subtype H1N1 virus. Some authors even suggest that the hyperinduction of cytokines may be relevant to the pathogenesis of human H5N1 disease but not for H1N1 [7]. In comparison with human seasonal influenza (H1N1) viruses, clade 1, 2.1, and 2.2 H5N1 viruses induced higher levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha in primary human macrophages, and some viral genetic determinants of H5N1 influenza viruses may contribute to cytokine dysregulation [8].",
