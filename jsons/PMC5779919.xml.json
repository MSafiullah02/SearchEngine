            "text": "Stress-related illness represents one of the biggest challenges to modern societies, but there is mounting evidence that individuals substantially vary in how they react to stressors. When facing daily hassles such as time pressure (see Cassidy, 2000; Kanner et al., 1981), or critical life events such as job loss or a divorce, some people develop mental illnesses such as depression or anxiety disorders. Other people, however, do not show such negative reactions to similar stressors. In other words, some individuals seem to be resilient against stressors and they apparently have the biological, social, or psychological resources to cope with such negative experiences. Luthans et al. (2007) defined resilience as the \u201ccapacity to rebound or bounce back from adversity, conflict, or failure\u201d (p. 18). It is one of the core concepts of positive psychology that has been studied and found to be predictive of people\u2019s health\u2014even under stressful circumstances. Gloria and Steinhardt (2016), for instance, found a buffering effect of resilience on the relation between stress and anxiety and depression. Shamaskin-Garroway et al. (2016) found more adjustment to effects of Parkinson\u2019s disease, and Yi-Frazier et al. (2015) found among diabetes patients that high resilience was associated with less distress, better glycemic control, and the use of more adaptive coping strategies.",

            "text": "A recent meta-analysis by Hu et al. (2015) summarized 60 studies with a total of 111 effect sizes and looked at the relation between trait resilience and health-related variables. The analyses revealed an average effect of \u2212.36 between resilience and negative indicators of well-being (i.e. depression, anxiety, and negative affect). The authors also identified positive relations between resilience and general life satisfaction and positive affect but no measures of domain-specific satisfaction or work engagement were included in the analyses. We found only one study that has investigated the relationship between resilience and work engagement by Mache et al. (2014) who reported a positive correlation in a cross-sectional survey of medical doctors in Germany. In line with the definition of Luthans et al. (2007), which suggests that resilience shows a buffering effect in the occurrence of negative event, Hu et al. (2015) also found that adversity was moderating the resilience-ill-health effect. That is, resilience was more strongly (negatively) related to ill-health in times of adversity. In this study, we further explore the idea of resilience as a variable that helps people cope with stress and thus reduces ill-health.",

            "text": "The social identity approach (cf. Haslam, 2004; Jetten et al., 2012) states that groups that provide us with a sense of belonging are good for health and well-being. The theoretical foundation for these beneficial effects is derived from social identity theory (Tajfel and Turner, 1979) and self-categorization theory (Turner, 1985). A key idea of these theories is that when individuals identify with groups, they have a common perspective and coordinate their behavior with respect to group norms. This also leads to providing and receiving more social support which in turn helps developing a stronger sense of collective self-efficacy (e.g. Avanzi et al., 2015; see also Blecharz et al., 2014 for the mediating role of collective efficacy between motivational climate and the well-being of athletes). In addition, it has been proposed that a shared social identity serves as a basis for a more favorable interpretation of social support (Haslam et al., 2012). In line with this notion, it has been found that social support has more positive effects if the provider and recipient of support share a social identity (Frisch et al., 2014). Above and beyond this potential to better cope with stressors due to more support and higher self-efficacy, social identification should also lead to greater well-being because it satisfies basic human needs for belonging and affiliation, certainty, and safety (e.g. Greenaway et al., 2016; Ketturat et al., 2016). The importance of social relationships for well-being has also been suggested by Rusk and Waters (2015) in their psycho-social system approach and by Stavrova and Luhmann (2016) who found that collective connectedness was related to a higher sense of meaning in life and vice versa. Along similar lines, Stok et al. (2014) showed that participants who identified strongly with groups with pro-health norms had higher vegetable consumption. On one hand, one would predict such positive effects of shared group identities and high identification only if the respective group is supportive and promotes healthy living norms (e.g. Sani et al., 2015). Group membership may, on the other hand, harm well-being when the group norms prescribe unhealthy behaviors (e.g. binge drinking, see Gardner et al., 2012), or when relations between members in a group are toxic and hostile.",

For the latent factors of work engagement and stress, we used parceling and combined half of the items into one indicator each (i.e. two parcels for engagement and two for stress). As expected, a model comprising four latent variables with two second-order factors, namely, one factor for ill-health (comprising stress and depression/anxiety) and a second factor for well-being (comprising satisfaction and engagement), fit the data best (\u03c72 = 125.02, degree of freedom (df) = 60, p < .05; comparative fit index (CFI) = .94; Tucker\u2013Lewis index (TLI) = .92; root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA) = .078; standardized root mean square residual (SRMR) = .058) and significantly better than a model with all indicators (respectively, parcels) loading on a single factor (\u03c72 = 1085.02, df = 78, p < .05; CFI = .63; TLI = .56; RMSEA = .18; SRMR = .11). As expected, the two second-latent order factors were significantly related (\u2212.71, the average absolute correlation between the four scales is much lower with r = .47) but the unshared variation of about 50 percent shows that they are not simply endpoints of a continuum but represent distinct aspects\u2014which supports our view of well-being and ill-health being two sides of one coin.",
