These diseases may appear as acute disease processes, such as salmonellosis in a child with reptile contact, or they could manifest in more chronic fashion, such as a brucellosis infection in a hunter. Sometimes zoonotic diseases spring from asymptomatic reservoirs, such as deermice (Peromyscus spp) that appear not to develop clinical illness from Hantavirus infection or the Borrelia spirochete that causes Lyme disease. Yet many zoonotic pathogens cause disease in both humans and animals, and veterinarians and physicians may find themselves treating similar disease complexes in their respective patients, even using similar antibiotic regimens.",

As mentioned above, this approach of treating the human disease in isolation of animal and environmental health aspects may stem from a perception that animals harboring infectious pathogens are often asymptomatic and not in need of clinical care. Indeed, a common medical recommendation is to remove an animal from a household, as when an obstetrician inappropriately advises that a pregnant woman avoid all cat contact to prevent toxoplasmosis (Kravetz and Federman 2005).",

Veterinary practices routinely identify hookworm (ancylostomiasis), roundworm (toxocariasis), and Cryptosporidia infestations, particularly in young companion animals (Hotez and Wilkins 2009). Kittens with flea infestations are epidemiologically linked with Bartonella infection in people (Klotz et al. 2011). Again, as with the human health clinicians, there is a tendency to treat the animal and not directly deal with issues of possible infection occurrence in nearby humans. However, veterinarians are trained to counsel their clients about zoonotic risks, and may recommend that the client seek medical care if symptoms should develop. At the same time, it is rare for veterinarians to directly contact their medical colleagues in the community, even if they are treating members of the same household.",

There have been well documented instances of animals serving as \u201csentinels\u201d for human disease risk.

            "text": "Another well publicized example of animal sentinel disease events was the 1999 emergence of West Nile virus (WNV) in the United States. WNV caused an acute and fatal encephalitis in crows and other birds in Bronx NY at the same time that humans in the area were reporting an increase in encephalitis cases. The unusual pathology pattern in the affected birds was what alerted an astute veterinary clinician to the fact that this was a novel virus infection event. Eventually, the human cases were also found to be due to WNV (Kahn 2006). It would have been ideal, in these cases, for both human health and veterinary clinicians to have recognized the cross-species relevance of the cases and taken steps to notify both public health as well as each other directly. They also, ideally, would have used such case information to consider whether there were environmental changes driving the emergence of the cases and \u201cshared risk\u201d of infection across different species that warranted further investigation. In terms of RMSF, for example, the patterns of abundance of the tick vector are unevenly distributed across the landscape (CDC 2012a) and an increase in detected cases and/or case severity could signify a change in the disease ecology (Adjemian et al. 2009). Using sentinel cases to focus investigations for environmental and ecological disruption and drivers of emergence is therefore a key aspect of One Health in clinical practice.\n",

An example would be a case of Streptococcus suis in an abattoir worker, who due to the fact that humans often receive greater diagnostic evaluation is diagnosed prior to the recognition of the organism in the swine herd. Such an instance represents a sentinel event with clinical importance both for the larger population of animal workers as well as the hogs to which the workers are exposed. Again in such cases, the veterinarian as well as the physician investigating the occurrence of Streptococcus suis in the herd and the animal workers must think about what changes in agricultural practices and environmental factors could have contributed to the emergence of the disease (Wertheim et al. 2009).",

In some cases, animal vaccinations reduce the risk of both the animal presenting with infection as well as zoonotic transmission to people. This is so, with rabies, leptospirosis, and brucellosis immunizations (Adams et al. 2011). The goal of strategic deworming is to eliminate individual parasite burdens as well as reduce the hazard of having hardy ova in the environment which can cause significant health problems in people. For example, ocular larval migrans from dog or cat roundworm infections are a preventable cause of childhood blindness. For this reason, puppies and kittens should be dewormed starting at 2 weeks of age, then every 2 weeks until they can receive an age-appropriate monthly intestinal deworming medication (Companion Animal Parasite Council 2012). Veterinarians can also guide appropriate pet selection to mitigate hazards to owners. Should an animal become infected with a zoonotic pathogen, timely diagnosis and treatment and proper husbandry will serve to reduce transmission to people. In these ways, veterinarians have a significant role in the public health controls of zoonoses.",

Examples of preventive recommendations are as follows:People at increased risk of zoonotic infection include infants and small children younger than age 5, elderly, pregnant women, and immunocompromised persons.Zoonotic disease prevention includes routine veterinary care for all pets, hand-washing, proper hygiene in disposal of animal waste, appropriate diet for the pets, and timely treatment for diseased pets. Specific recommendations for all patients include hand-washing after handling pets and pet dishes, and avoiding contact with animal feces and vomitus through proper disposal. Pregnant women should avoid handling cat feces and litter, keep cats indoors, and not feed cats uncooked meat to reduce the risk of toxoplasmosis. Additionally, people at increased risk of zoonotic infection should not feed pets raw meat diets to prevent enteric pathogens.Keeping exotic pets carries increased risk of exotic pathogens, an example being an outbreak of monkeypox in the Midwest United States traced to imported African rodents (Reed et al. 2004). Wild animals kept as pets may pose a greater infection risk. Veterinarians can be referred to assist with appropriate pet selection.Pets that roam outdoors or that are fed outdoors may have greater contact with wildlife and the pathogens they carry.Particular habits of pet ownership may play a pivotal role governing transmission of pet pathogens. Sleeping with pets has been linked to cases of the plague, cat-scratch disease, and Chagas disease (Chomel and Sun 2012). Close animal contact, including biting, scratching, licking, and kissing, has resulted in transmission and infection from Capnocytophaga canimorsus (Valtonen et al. 1995), lymphocytic choriomeningitis, and Pasteurella spp (Kimura et al. 2004).\n",

For example, the worldwide epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was first noted in a chef in Hong Kong who was preparing wild animal meat for consumption. Subsequent serological surveys of live animal market workers in China showed evidence of transmission between wild animals and these workers. The emergence of Nipah virus in Malaysia took place in the setting of large-scale swine production in the vicinity of rain forest that was home to the wildlife reservoir of the pathogen (flying foxes\u2014Pteropus sp.) and the first human cases were swine workers exposed to diseased pigs (Chua 2010). One of the first recorded fatalities to highly pathogenic avian influenza was a veterinarian responding to the poultry outbreak of H7N7 avian influenza in the Netherlands, and highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza has caused numerous deaths in humans working with poultry in either the commercial or backyard setting (WHO 2012). While the exact circumstances of the reassortment event leading to the worldwide pandemic of 2009 H1N1 novel influenza A infection remain unknown, it is likely that the reassortment took place in swine and then crossed to human populations through a swine worker with close contact with infected animals. Since that original event, there have been documented cases of reverse zoonotic transmission of H1N1 from infected swine workers to pigs, and this may have contributed to the recent emergence of a recombinant H3N2 strain (CDCb). The growing industrialization of agricultural animal production demands a more organized approach to infectious disease risks in concentrated animal settings, and this must include both worker health and reduction of pathogen pollution from animal waste.",
