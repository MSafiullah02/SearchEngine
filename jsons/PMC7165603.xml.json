            "text": "Emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) occur when microbial pathogens spread into new contexts. EIDs are unpredictable, can spread quickly, and often have devastating consequences. High\u2010profile examples of EIDs include HIV/AIDS (Gao et al., 1999), Ebola virus (Carroll et al., 2015) and Zika virus (Faria, Azevedo, et al., 2016). Recent outbreaks of Ebola and Zika have caused tens of thousands of deaths and prompted global panic, further galvanising infectious disease researchers\u2019 sense of urgency and commitment to developing approaches to monitor and manage EIDs. This work includes an interest in realising the potential of new technologies and big data to minimise the consequences of future outbreaks through initiatives such as the continued development of infectious disease surveillance systems managed by governments, international bodies and academic consortia. Infectious disease surveillance systems are designed to meet the temporal challenge of fast\u2010spreading EIDs by rapidly identifying outbreaks of new pathogens. Their goal is to inform earlier and better interventions in order to contain spread and improve public health outcomes.",

Just as infectious diseases have no regard for national borders, the argument goes, nor should attitudes toward data sharing: global risk must be met by global surveillance efforts across political boundaries to prevent loss of life.1 By facilitating fast global responses, EID surveillance is deemed to have the potential to address the geographical as well as the temporal challenge presented by EIDs. In this article, we discuss some of the questions that could arise from the integration of genomic data into a global surveillance system.",

            "text": "Genomic sequencing is useful in EID surveillance because the genomes of pathogens can be used to elucidate the development of an outbreak. Earlier techniques involved targeting specific regions of the pathogen genome in so\u2010called \u201cmolecular epidemiology\u201d; in \u201cgenomic epidemiology\u201d the entire genome is sequenced, providing much more information (Struelens & Brisse, 2013). Early on in outbreaks, information from sequencing can be used to estimate the evolutionary rate of the pathogen (e.g., the influenza A H1N1 pandemic of 2009: Fraser et al., 2009). Mutations in the genome can then be used to reconstruct a phylogeny, where differences between sampled strains due to their evolutionary history allow the reconstruction of their transmission and origins. Genomic epidemiology can therefore assist in the identification of transmission mechanisms to inform public health responses from national governments and non\u2010governmental organisations (NGOs). For example, a pathogen which has emerged from a single zoonosis into humans and spreads via human\u2010to\u2010human transmission (e.g., the West African Ebola outbreak of 2013\u20132016: Tong et al., 2015) will have a very different phylogeny to one which emerges from repeated introductions into the human population by animal\u2010to\u2010human transmission (e.g., sporadic Mycobacterium bovis infections in the UK between 2005 and 2010: Stone et al., 2012). Differentiating between transmission routes enables better informed public health responses, including more specific containment advice for the public: for example, evidence from genomic data that a particular strain is transmitted from animals to humans can be used to explain and justify control measures in agricultural settings (e.g., swine\u2010to\u2010human transmission of influenza A H3N2 in Ohio, USA in 2012: Bowman et al., 2014). Genomic epidemiology has shown in some settings that conventional epidemiology fails to capture complex transmission routes (e.g., hospital cases of Enterococcus faecium in the UK: Raven et al., 2017), suggesting that infection control procedures based on conventional information are inadequate. Genomic sequencing can also be used to retrospectively identify \u201ccryptic\u201d transmission, where pathogens have circulated prior to the first known case (e.g., the pre\u2010detection circulation of Zika virus in Brazil: Faria et al., 2017). Historically, genomic data for EID pathogens has not been widely available to researchers for the purposes of surveillance, or during ongoing outbreaks, although it can still be used in attempts to better understand previous outbreaks and identify their origins (e.g., the origin of HIV\u20101 in chimpanzees: Gao et al., 1999).",

            "text": "One reason for the exclusively retrospective nature of genomic EID surveillance is that sequencing machines (henceforth, \u201csequencers\u201d) have heretofore been large, slow and expensive. The ability to sequence has been (generally speaking) restricted to organisations with significant resources at their disposal \u2013 whereas EIDs themselves disproportionately affect some of the least wealthy areas of the world. Frequently, samples are taken from low\u2010income countries during EID outbreaks to high\u2010income countries to be sequenced. This movement and its consequences are often characterised by a highly unequal distribution of rights, responsibilities, access, and knowledge. Significant conflicts have emerged from the asymmetric relationships arising in the collection, ownership, and use of data derived from such samples. Examples include the conflicting priorities of the US government in influenza vaccine development requiring the patenting of viral sequences (Hammond, 2008, pp. 22\u201323); researchers\u2019 complaints of the \u201cbureaucratic nightmare\u201d of shipping samples potentially containing Ebola virus (Kupferschmidt, 2017); and the dispute between the Saudia Arabian government and Dutch researchers over a novel coronavirus (Butler, 2013; MacKenzie, 2013; \u2013 discussed in more detail in Section 4). Despite increasing demand for protections for the \u201cowners\u201d of samples (WHO, 2017), normal research protocols are not necessarily followed during rapid outbreaks; during the 2013\u20132016 West African Ebola outbreak, the World Health Organization Ethics Research Committee (WHO\u2010ERC) decided to approve studies using such samples \u201cbased on researcher commitment to put appropriate agreements/processes in place\u201d for sample and data ownership \u201c[i]n view of the urgency\u201d of the situation (Alirol et al., 2017, p. 7).",

            "text": "Increased data sharing across disease surveillance systems is \u2013 in principle \u2013 endorsed by many governments, funders and pharmaceutical companies, for example the UK government (O'Neill, 2016, p. 32), the Wellcome Trust (2018), and the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers & Associations (IFPMA, 2016, 2018). This attitude has led to the creation of collaborative endeavours such as the Infectious Diseases Data Observatory (IDDO, 2018), which aims to link the \u201cglobal infectious disease community across the research and humanitarian sectors\u201d to share data on EIDs. Some have criticised data sharing as usually having a hidden agenda (Mirowski, 2018) and even proponents acknowledge that ensuring the equitability of data sharing is challenging (Edelstein et al., 2018). Concurrently, over the past five years significantly smaller, faster and less expensive sequencers have been developed to the point where sequencers are now portable (definitions of \u201cportable\u201d vary, but we assume that a \u201cportable sequencer\u201d is one that can be easily transported and used by a single person in the field). Portable sequencing technologies allow the processing of samples in situ. For example, the Zika in Brazil Real\u2010time Analysis (ZiBRA) project recently created a portable genome sequencing laboratory in a mobile trailer by using Oxford Nanopore MinION sequencers (Faria, Sabino, et al., 2016). This project was a primarily UK\u2013Brazil collaboration involving public health researchers in Brazil and a global community of researchers, and had a stated \u201copen data release policy\u201d to release sequencing datasets \u201cas soon as we produce them\u201d (Zibra Project, 2016). The ZiBRA project has been referenced as an impressive proof of principle that portable sequencers in conjunction with this type of data sharing can be used effectively and productively in outbreak settings (Leggett & Clark, 2017; Loose, 2017).\n",

In a recent article, Gardy and Loman (2018) reviewed the state of the art and made recommendations for future developments. Both have considerable experience in the synthesis of genomic data for outbreak responses. For example, Loman was involved in the crowd\u2010sourced analysis of a E. coli O104:H4 outbreak in May/June 2011 in Germany (Rohde et al., 2011), and Gardy has used genomic sequencing in conjunction with social network analysis to elucidate chains of transmission in tuberculosis (Gardy et al., 2011). In their review, Gardy and Loman outline the possibility of linking portable sequencers via a worldwide network to achieve a \u201csequencing singularity\u201d: \u201cthe moment at which pathogen, environmental and digital data streams are integrated into a global surveillance system\u201d (Gardy & Loman, 2018, p. 18).2 This statement is emblematic of a broad vision for the future of EID surveillance, one that extrapolates from the increasing tendency for data aggregation from multiple sources to a future \u201csingularity\u201d: a state of affairs whereby omniscience in the form of real\u2010time and expansive surveillance could facilitate near omnipotence in responses to EIDs.

Our informal discussions about genomic sequencing crystallised in light of recent events related to digital data (see Authors\u2019 Note at the end), and motivated this article. Discussing EID surveillance across disciplines required both of us to engage with unfamiliar material. While we have endeavoured to draw on and acknowledge relevant existing work, we remain aware that omissions are inevitable, and that it has been necessary to pass over some areas almost cursorily.

We then discuss the relationship between visualisation in contemporary EID surveillance and genomics and the \u201csequencing singularity\u201d vision, before challenging the vision's geography by exploring two possible consequences of ubiquitous portable sequencing. First, we demonstrate that widespread use of portable sequencing in EID surveillance could result in the emergence of ethical and practical problems which require the recasting of questions of biological sovereignty at an interpersonal rather than international level. Second, we suggest that the \u201csequencing singularity\u201d vision privileges a particular understanding of what constitutes \u201csignal\u201d and \u201cnoise\u201d within metagenomic datasets, foreclosing other exciting possibilities.

            "text": "Outbreaks of EIDs are typically initiated by chance events, and are therefore inherently unpredictable. The West African Ebola virus epidemic of 2013\u20132016 is believed to have originated from the infection of two\u2010year\u2010old Emile Ouamouno in Guinea. After his death, the virus went on to infect over 28,000 other people, killing at least 11,000 (WHO, 2016). The unpredictability and devastating consequences of EIDs have been compared to those of gigantic forest fires started from a single spark, with the international aid efforts that start only when the outbreak is already underway likened to \u201cvaliant bucket brigades organized after the fire is out of control\u201d (Worobey, 2017, p. 356). Worobey and others have stressed the need for constant and extensive surveillance to detect unfolding outbreaks and enable international organisations to intervene as quickly as possible. The fundamental unpredictability of such events means that the dominant method of relying on targeted surveillance narrowly focused on specific sources risks failure to detect outbreaks emerging from other sources. A perception that the quantity or quality of data available is inadequate can also render judgements with important political consequences more controversial, such as the categorisation of an ongoing incident as a pandemic (Abeysinghe, 2013) or the predicted number of future cases. The latter is a highly politicised figure that frequently dominates the discourse around EID response, but is often based on assumptions about the poor quality of available data. Epidemiologists attempt to account for suspected underreporting of initial cases, which often leads to what one might call \u201cconservative overestimations.\u201d For example, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's September 2014 prediction for the number of Ebola virus disease cases in Liberia and Sierra Leone by January 2015 in the absence of any intervention was nearly tripled from 550,000 to 1.4 million \u201cwhen corrected for underreporting\u201d (Meltzer et al., 2014, p. 3), a number that was repeated in global media and framed as a \u201cset of ominous projections\u201d of a \u201cworst\u2010case scenario\u201d (Grady, 2014). Invoking the unknown is an important strategy for scientists acting as \u201cprophets,\u201d who aim to be \u201crecognized as reasonable and accepted as authoritative\u201d (Caduff, 2014, p. 296). MacPhail (2014, p. 136) has demonstrated how this sort of dramatic uncertainty, referenced by scientists as \u201cthe absence of \u2018good data,\u2019\u201d is often deployed strategically to strengthen scientific authority. It is also frequently used as a key argument in the drive to incorporate more and more data into surveillance systems (see e.g., Barboza, 2017).",

For the purposes of this article, we take \u201csurveillance\u201d to mean \u201cthe organized monitoring of the activities of actors\u201d for the purpose of governing (Henry, 2009, p. 95). We use \u201cEID surveillance\u201d as a catch\u2010all term referring to monitoring activities that are intended to alert authorities to the presence of outbreaks and to inform their responses. EID surveillance itself takes many forms, and it is not our aim to provide an extensive taxonomy here. We do, however, wish to highlight a current trend away from traditional indicator\u2010based surveillance. Indicator\u2010based approaches specify known cut\u2010offs for outbreaks based on regularly updated indicators from laboratories or healthcare facilities. In contrast, event\u2010based surveillance systems are based on \u201cunstructured descriptions and reports\u201d which are then rapidly assessed for the risk posed to public health (WHO, 2008, p. 3). The emphasis is on quickly detecting the \u201csignal\u201d of an event that poses a risk to public health from the \u201cnoise\u201d of other events. The spectrum of data envisaged for inclusion in event\u2010based surveillance is much wider than that used in indicator\u2010based surveillance, with any digital information that can be scraped from Internet sites being utilised. The drive towards increasingly powerful event\u2010based surveillance has already led to the development of multiple approaches: a recent review identified 50 such event\u2010based Internet systems (O'Shea, 2017). This proliferation in turn has led to many to call for initiatives in the direction of a \u201csuper\u2010system \u2026 to pool expert systems\u2019 expertise\u201d (Barboza et al., 2013, p. 8). WHO plan to roll out such a \u201csuper\u2010system\u201d in 2018, integrating traditional and social media with government sources and processing over one million media articles a week (Barboza, 2017, p. 11).",

Due to the physical size of sequencers, sequencing data has until recently been physically tied to established laboratories and in turn restricted to informing indicator\u2010based systems. Recent optimism about portable sequencers arises from their potential to liberate sequencing data from such limitations and ultimately enable an instantly globally accessible digital sequencing data stream. Presently, such hopes are intimately linked to devices like the Oxford Nanopore MinION: a palm\u2010sized sequencer which offers direct DNA or RNA sequencing in \u201cREAL Real\u2010time [sic]\u201d (Oxford Nanopore, 2018). Portable sequencers like the MinION are intended \u201cto enable the analysis of any living thing, by any person, in any environment\u201d (Oxford Nanopore, 2018). In the context of EID surveillance, indiscriminate sequencing of the total genomic content of samples without a species bias (metagenomic sequencing) would enable an \u201cevent\u2010based\u201d approach to pathogen detection. Although there are still considerable technological obstacles to the deployment of widespread portable sequencing, the MinION is emblematic of the ostensible benefits of portable sequencing, particularly with regard to its incorporation into global digital networks in the \u201csequencing singularity.\u201d",

            "text": "Considering the implications of portable sequencers in EID surveillance requires careful thought about what happens when a technology becomes ubiquitous. We urge that enthusiasm for the opportunities afforded by portable sequencing be tempered by an appreciation of the multivalence of technology. On this point, we think that a historical example is instructive. From the early 1980s, early adopters of the Internet used the discussions system Usenet to communicate with each other. Many of these early adopters shared a cyber\u2010utopian belief in \u201cthe emancipatory nature of online communication,\u201d which offered particular transformational potential for society (Morozov, 2012, p. xiii). But when AOL offered Usenet access to its customers in September 1993, the system was flooded with new users who did not subscribe to the same vision and values, and whose participation saw the platform evolve in other, unexpected, directions. Some previous users felt this was responsible for a change and \u201cinexorable decline\u201d in the quality of Usenet discussions, an \u201cEternal September\u201d (Raymond, 2003).3 The technology also became increasingly corporatised and controlled by monopolies, which had corresponding effects on the \u201copen Internet spirit\u201d (Kr\u00e4mer et al., 2013, p. 795). For example, many early Internet enthusiasts supported strict net neutrality, which \u201cprohibits Internet service providers from speeding up, slowing down or blocking Internet traffic based on its source, ownership or destination\u201d (Kr\u00e4mer et al., 2013, p. 796). During the 1990s the Internet service provider AOL was the leading corporate campaigner for a US national policy on net neutrality (Chiappinelli et al., 2007, p. 960). However, after AOL merged with the media company Time Warner in 2000 (one of the largest mergers in US history) it had a vested interest in operating a network with \u201cfavorable treatment\u201d for its own content, and therefore ceased campaigning for net neutrality (Chiappinelli et al., 2007, pp. 960\u2013961). Corporate dynamics therefore shape the flow of information through networks. Our point in drawing a parallel between early Internet users and contemporary portable sequencing enthusiasts is to suggest that the latter, like the former, risk committing what we tentatively term the \u201cEarly Adopter Fallacy\u201d: the belief by a community of early adopters of a technology that their shared vision and values are straightforwardly related to the technology itself, and will therefore naturally continue to be a fundamental element of its use. However, the expansion in use of a technology is a process in which technology, users, corporations and values continually recombine in unexpected ways. From design and production to deployment and beyond, technologies are fraught with politics, entangled in complex and changing relations with people, things and places. Ultimately, technologies almost always surprise us in some way as they evolve; this will undoubtedly be true for portable sequencers. This is certainly not an inherently bad thing, but it is incumbent upon us to do our best to try to recognise and attend to the problems \u2013 and indeed opportunities \u2013 presented by such under\u2010determination.",

Within the \u201csequencing singularity,\u201d the aim is to intercept and transform sufficient information related to EIDs to reliably map the relevant parts of the \u201creal\u201d world in \u201creal time.\u201d Gardy and Loman (2018, p. 16) imagine that in the near future novel EID events will be routinely detected with the help of portable sequencers:It is 2027, and our planet's changing climate and land\u2010use patterns have meant that new emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) are spilling over into humans from wildlife reservoirs with increasing frequency \u2026 a global public health consortium has implemented an online surveillance tool that scans the digital output of citizens, news organisations and governments in those regions, including data from local retailers on key health\u2010related products\u2026In one such region, the syndromic surveillance system reports higher\u2010than\u2010average sales of a common medication used to relieve fever. Spatial analysis of the data from the pharmacies in the region suggests that the trend is unique to a particular district; a follow\u2010up geographic information system (GIS) analysis using satellite data reveals that this area borders a forest and is increasingly being used for the commercial production of bat guano. An alert is triggered, and the field response team meets with citizens in the area. Nasopharyngeal swabs are taken from humans and livestock with fever as well as from guano and bat tissue collected in the area. The samples are immediately analysed using a portable DNA sequencer coupled to a smartphone. An app on the phone reports the clinical metagenomic results in real time, revealing that \u2026 a novel coronavirus makes up the bulk of the microbial nucleic acid fraction. The sequencing data are immediately uploaded to a public repository as they are generated, tagged with metadata about the host, sample type and location and stored according to a pathogen surveillance ontology. The data release triggers an announcement via social media of a novel sequence, and within minutes, interested virologists have created a shared online workspace and open lab notebook to collect their analyses of the new pathogen.\n",

We examine current visualisations of genomic data in EID surveillance, which connect the genomic and the global but occlude intermediate scales. Second, we look at the ownership of genomic data. We argue that norms of ownership are still heavily influenced by the historical development of sequencers and circumstances of their use, and that portable sequencers will disrupt these norms by virtue of their reduced size. In other words, we feel the \u201csequencing singularity\u201d vision does not take sufficient account of the unsustainability of existing practices around data ownership.

Other scales are conspicuous by their absence. We argue that expanded use of portable sequencing will both enable and necessitate thinking about EIDs and genomic data at scales other than the international and the genomic. In contrast to the smooth workings of EID surveillance in Gardy & Loman's imagined scenario, unexpected problems and opportunities will arise if ubiquitous portable sequencing facilitates the integration of genomic data into a global EID surveillance system. Just as EIDs present a fundamentally unpredictable problem to public health, unexpected states of affairs could arise from the widespread use of portable sequencers. We suggest, therefore, that the sequencing singularity vision should be considered with cautious scepticism for two reasons: it does not and cannot account for all significant consequences of widespread portable sequencing for EID surveillance, and \u2013 perhaps more significantly \u2013 the vision's attendant geography forecloses emergent opportunities. Of course, it would be contradictory for us to suggest that we ourselves can predict the consequences of ubiquitous sequencing. Nevertheless, we use two possible examples to demonstrate the shortcomings of the sequencing singularity vision and to emphasise a need for researchers to challenge implicit assumptions, move beyond taken\u2010for\u2010granted states of affairs, and be open to new and different topologies of EID research.

For example, in 2012 a Saudi Arabian virologist cultured an unidentified virus from a patient, and sent the sample to the Erasmus Medical Center (EMC) in the Netherlands to be sequenced. Dutch scientists sequenced the sample and identified it as a novel coronavirus: Middle East respiratory syndrome\u2010related coronavirus (MERS\u2010CoV). EMC then patented the sequence of the viral genome before the Saudi Arabian government were aware of the isolate \u2013 a \u201cnormal thing to do\u201d in the words of one virologist (Mayer, 2013), and a reasonable \u201cdefensive strategy\u201d according to another, who notes that patenting assists in asserting rights over future work such as diagnostic tests (Butler, 2013). These opinions were not shared by the Saudi Arabian government, leading to an argument over whether national procedures for reporting potential novel pathogens had been followed and prompting debate about the ethics of intellectual property surrounding pathogen genome sequences (Butler, 2013). The dispute was followed by the termination of the employment of the virologist who had mailed the sample (MacKenzie, 2012). The Saudi Arabian government enacted its own biological sovereignty over the isolate, and claimed that the Dutch patent had impeded its own efforts to track the virus (MacKenzie, 2013). Such disputes are often characterised as being solely about national\u2013international tensions, but Stephenson (2011) has convincingly argued that biological sovereignty over EIDs actually involves rival global health security aggregates. Viewed in this way, Indonesia's withdrawal from WHO's virus\u2010sharing scheme in 2007 after Indonesian samples were transferred for use by a pharmaceutical company without consultation was not simply a biological sovereignty dispute where a nation state refused to cooperate with an international health organisation, but a complex debate involving global health players such as \u201cpharmaceutical companies, other international agencies such as the World Bank and the IMF, private global funds \u2026, NGOs, and many different government departments and units\u201d (Stephenson, 2011, p. 626).",

The spur to establishing this anchor often comes from nations with less authority in global biomedicine who are disadvantaged by superficially straightforward and unobjectionable \u201cparadigms of open science\u201d (Hinterberger & Porter, 2015, p. 362). Previous work on the emerging forms of biological sovereignty in the context of EIDs has focused at the level of the national\u2013international disputes that have been created by the frequent asymmetries in power produced when samples from less wealthy countries have sequencing data produced for them in wealthier countries. Although these asymmetries are not always simplistically linked to national wealth \u2013 for example, in the case of MERS\u2010CoV, Saudia Arabia and the Netherlands have similar GDPs (World Bank, 2017) \u2013 the general concentration of sequencers in wealthier countries and of pathogens in less wealthy countries and the consequent movement of samples between nations has meant that questions of biological sovereignty have historically been posed and considered at the international scale. Discussion has been about how countries and other international aggregates exert sovereignty over pathogen genomes, illustrated by dramatic case studies from outbreaks. The international scale also dominates the implicit geography of the \u201csequencing singularity\u201d vision, which assumes that cheap portable sequencers have the potential to prevent such disputes by eliminating the asymmetry that underlies them: if the ability to sequence pathogens is distributed more equitably worldwide, more pathogens will be sequenced in situ, and establishing sovereignty over samples and the data derived from them will be straightforward.",

The unpredictable and potentially apocalyptic consequences of \u201cemergence\u201d imply that a single individual refusing to share their data could significantly delay the response to an outbreak. In a world where portable sequencers could be carried around, would we all be morally obligated to continuously upload information from them? Furthermore, many people might feel additionally uncomfortable if corporations were involved in the data processing, upload and storage \u2013 all of which seems highly likely if current trends continue.

This raises the prospect that surveillance datasets will include data not just from designated pathogens, but also from commensal microbes and even humans; sequencing a sample transforms these different forms of life into digital data that is technologically indistinguishable with respect to how it is processed and stored (if still separable by bioinformatic analysis into different species).

This increasing appreciation of the importance of human\u2013microbe relations has prompted considerations of \u201cmicrobiopolitics,\u201d which considers \u201cthe elaboration of appropriate human behaviors vis\u2010a\u2010vis microorganisms engaged in infection, inoculation, and digestion\u201d (Paxson, 2008, p. 17). With the recognition that microbial communities are often ecologically linked to human practices, questions of ownership have also been raised previously by anthropologists (Benezra et al., 2012). While we cannot provide a satisfactory overview of this growing body of social science literature on the human microbiome, we wish to bring some thoughts to bear on the problem we are considering. The use of portable sequencers in EID surveillance will lead to the accumulation of metagenomic data from the human microbiome, and here we build on ideas from microbiome research to consider some possible consequences.",

Concentrating on the detection of these transmission paths can cast humans as little more than passive detectors for monitoring the dynamic spread of pathogens. However, this is not the only possible human\u2013microbe relationship. Indeed, the vast majority of microbes that inhabit human bodies are adapted to long\u2010term residence and are an ever\u2010present part of our bodies; in Helmreich's (2014) coinage, we are \u201cHomo microbis.\u201d EIDs thus represent an unusual set of human\u2013microbe relations compared with this norm. More\u2010than\u2010human geographies (Whatmore, 2006) seek to recognise the importance of such interdependent multispecies relations, for example in an account of human health as a \u201cmore\u2010than\u2010human achievement\u201d (Lorimer, 2017, p. 103).

However, such targeting requires prior knowledge of the pathogen's genome, which is unavailable for novel EIDs. Advances in technology linked to genomics have been implicated in a general \u201clevelling of biological differences\u201d between organisms, \u201creinforced by the re\u2010materialisation of biological entities in the guise of machine\u2010readable informatic codes\u201d (Whatmore, 2006, p. 606). While a great deal of microbiome research has used sequencing of only the 16S ribosomal RNA gene to target only bacterial taxa present in samples, increasingly it is common to perform complete metagenomic sequencing of all DNA present in a sample, which presents significantly higher resolution information but also does not (in itself) methodologically discriminate between bacterial and human DNA. As metagenomic sequencing becomes cheaper and more common, surveillance will come to entail sifting through all the \u201clevelled\u201d mixed metagenomic data that can be isolated from a sample to find that, for example, \u201ca novel coronavirus makes up the bulk of the microbial nucleic acid fraction\u201d (Gardy & Loman, 2018, p. 16). The possibility of metagenomic sequencing being used in an EID surveillance network therefore raises the question of what \u2013 or who \u2013 is actually under surveillance. We suggest that the term \u201cmore\u2010than\u2010human surveillance\u201d may be appropriate for describing this state of affairs.",

Furthermore, they usually only succeed in reducing the amount of human DNA sequenced rather than eliminating it entirely (Feehery et al., 2013; Hasan et al., 2016). Human genomic data seems to be viewed as a \u201cby\u2010product\u201d by advocates of the sequencing singularity. For clinical researchers aiming to detect pathogens with metagenomic sequencing directly from samples, any human DNA from the patient represents \u201ccontamination\u201d and these sequences are filtered out of downstream analysis. Other contexts provide examples where this DNA has proved to be both a valuable resource and an ethical liability. A recent study used metagenomic sequencing of saliva samples to simultaneously characterise the microbiome, detect specific pathogens, and analyse human population genetics \u2013 all from the same original data files (Lassalle et al., 2018). From a medical ethics standpoint, the procedures for managing sequencing data files should assume that human DNA may be present, because this \u201ccontamination\u201d could both be used fruitfully in another analysis and could pose risks (see below). Defying the geography implicitly prescribed by the pathogen\u2010gentric \u201csequencing singularity\u201d enables a different understanding of the indiscriminate metagenomic data generated by portable sequencers, recasting \u201cnoise\u201d as an opportunity rather than an obstacle, albeit an opportunity raising new ethical problems.

For example, individuals who live together share more similar microbiomes (Shaw et al., 2017; Song et al., 2013) and events like moving abroad or diarrheal illness alter the microbiome (David et al., 2014). The microbiome therefore contains implicit information about not only individuals\u2019 lifestyles (e.g., their diet and drug intake) but, crucially, social relationships between individuals (e.g., shared households and interaction patterns) (Rothschild et al., 2018).

Metagenomic data will have (unpredictable) value above and beyond the surveillance of EIDs. The wider possibilities for this data are absent from the \u201csequencing singularity\u201d vision, perhaps because they are irrelevant to its central goal. The collection and instant global sharing of such information offers opportunities for exploitation as well as for the protection of health. To view the data as a \u201cby\u2010product\u201d is to neglect these opportunities \u2013 opportunities which are unlikely to be neglected by corporate entities as they arise.

In early 2018 we came across Ruffino's (2017) article \u201cArchaeology for Cyborgs\u201d which addressed the question: \u201chow do we draw the line between legitimate research and an invasion of privacy?\u201d and stimulated our initial discussions about data sharing. Our concerns about data and personal privacy were felt all the more keenly in April 2018, when N.S. received a notification on facebook.com informing her that because one of her friends had logged into the app \u201cThis is Your Digital Life,\u201d her own information including public profile, page likes, date of birth, and current city were \u201cprobably\u201d shared with the app and in turn with (now\u2010defunct) political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica Ltd (Facebook, 2018: personal communication). Our thinking was also influenced by a widely reported case where an inadvertent surveillance system unexpectedly made visible a highly sensitive geography: the smartphone app Strava, used by many individuals to track their jogging routes and times using their GPS location, released a global heatmap of all public user activity online in late 2017. Operational security researchers noted that this map could be used to identify the secret locations of US military bases in Syria because Strava had recorded the regular jogs of military personnel around the bases (Hern, 2018). All individuals involved had freely consented (knowingly or unknowingly) to the use of their data in this way. This incident demonstrated that it is not only individual\u2010level privacy that is at stake when individuals consent to submit data to an aggregated global system. Finally, our sense of the difficulty of responding to the chaotic and the unpredictable was heightened by N.S.'s proximity to the Saddleworth Moor wildfire which broke out on Sunday 24 June 2018 and was still smouldering as we finalised this paper.",
