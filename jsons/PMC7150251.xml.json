Routine responsibility for disease prevention and outbreak investigation falls on public health agencies. Responsibility for medical management of illness caused by disease rests with the medical systems of communities. The investigational and prosecutorial aspects of intentional acts with disease threat falls into the hands of federal law enforcement officials. Finally, responsibility for all hazards preparedness and resource allocations falls onto the shoulders of emergency managers.",

Human error or technical disasters typically do not create as many casualties. For instance, the accidental release of 90 tons of chlorine in Graniteville, South Carolina, and the collapse of the I35 Bridge in Minnesota are examples of technical disasters with limited impact. Human malevolence through acts such as the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and the bombing of the Murrah Building may not produce casualties to the extent of natural disasters, but it resonates with the public into a lasting memory. Terrorist tactics are evolving from the terrorism of the past to the new terrorism, where the targets are indiscriminate and the intent is to injure or kill as many people as possible (Martin, 2008).",

            "text": "With respect to preparedness for an act of bioterrorism, one of the greatest challenges that community officials face is balancing preparedness and mitigation programs for all other hazards against the low probability of a biological event. As part of the risk assessment process, the community looks at its vulnerability to biological events, and as the 2001 Amerithrax incident revealed, each community has some vulnerability to bioterrorism. Community planners and emergency managers need to evaluate the consequence of such an event and ask the question: If it were to happen here, how bad might it be? Along with this question, they must assess their organic capability to handle anticipated consequences. That said, many community planners would determine that, even if a biological event were to happen, the consequences would be minimal. Although that assessment might prove to be true with respect to adverse effects to life, property, and the environment, it greatly underestimates the economic and societal impact of an act of bioterrorism.Critical ThinkingThe 2001 Amerithrax incident did not create a large pool of casualties (5 deaths out of 22 total cases), which supports the argument that an intentional biological release is a low-consequence event from a medical perspective, therefore not requiring significant mitigation activities. On the other hand, significant resources are now deployed to prevent and provide early detection of another similar attack. Is the main objective to minimize the medical consequences in another attack or is it an attempt to restore confidence in the government\u2019s ability to protect the American public?\n",

Hospitals and general medical providers are in many respects the gatekeepers for a healthy and safe public. Surveillance can be defined as ongoing systematic collection, collation, analysis, and interpretation of data and the dissemination of information to those who need to know for action to be taken. Effective communicable disease control relies on an effective surveillance and response system that promotes better coordination and integration of surveillance functions (WHO, n.d.).

Passive surveillance systems rely on laboratory and hospital staff, physicians, and other relevant sources to take the initiative to provide data on illnesses to the health department, where officials analyze and interpret the information as it arrives. In contrast, in an active disease surveillance system, public health officials contact sources, such as laboratories, hospitals, and physicians, to obtain information on conditions or diseases to identify cases. In theory, active surveillance can provide more complete detection of disease patterns than a system that is wholly dependent on voluntary reporting. Having dedicated personnel to accomplish active surveillance is a challenge for any administrator. Public health departments are traditionally thin on staffing. Taking staff time to look for a problem that may or may not exist, at the expense of one of the many ongoing daily health department programs, is problematic.",

Many experts believe that the inherent rigidity in a standard operating protocol for crime scene processing could be unwieldy and impractical in a bioterrorism event, which may compromise evidence collection in some cases. Therefore consultation among the different entities involved in a response should provide best-practice options framed on established guidelines. The plan can be modified after greater scrutiny of the crime scene or as more information is obtained during the course of the investigation.

This includes systems of triage that enables the care of victims assigned to lower levels of definitive medical care to be transferred to higher-level care sites, and vice versa. An extension of this strategy is the promotion and support of home care. Taken together, these strategies are geared to lessen the chance that emergency departments and hospitals will be inundated with patients who could be successfully managed in nonhospital or lower-level care settings, reserving hospital care for those most in need. Exactly who will provide this care, protocols that are to be followed, reimbursement for services, and protection against liability are issues to be solved locally by all preparedness partners.",

The release of a disease agent, regardless of the intended target, may have implications for animal and human hosts. A bioterrorist incident aimed at human populations may manifest in animals. In fact, the animals may show signs of the disease before the human targets. In this way animals may act as a sentinel host. In addition, animals may also be infected by the release and serve to maintain the pathogen in an area. In this instance, the animals may act as a reservoir for the disease agent. What this suggests is that animal health and human health officials should have good working relationships and that surveillance data must be shared.",

Many agencies from the federal government will respond to a CBRNE incident, providing necessary resources. Planners within local jurisdictions need to maintain a list of the agencies, the contact numbers, and the resources available from each. State and local governments must be fully compliant with NIMS. This includes the adaptation of the ICS. Unified or area command is an essential element in domestic incident management in which multiple jurisdictions and agencies are involved. It provides guidelines to enable agencies with different legal, geographic, and functional responsibilities to effectively coordinate, plan, and interact. Unified or area command removes much of the inefficiency and duplication of effort that can occur when agencies from different functional and geographic jurisdictions or agencies at different levels of government operate without a common system or organizational framework.",

An organization established to oversee the management of multiple incidents that are each being handled by an ICS organization or to oversee the management of large or multiple incidents where several incident management teams have been assigned.

This is a systematic tool used for the command, control, and coordination of emergency response.
