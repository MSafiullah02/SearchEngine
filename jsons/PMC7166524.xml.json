            "text": "Respiratory viral infections are responsible for a spectrum of disease severity ranging from mild, uncomplicated illness to severe, complicated viral pneumonias. Disease severity can be affected by various host and viral predisposing factors such as age, immune\u2010status of the host, single or mixed infections and virulence mechanisms of the viral pathogen. The common respiratory viruses causing infections are influenza A and B viruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza viruses (PIV), coronaviruses (CoV), and adenovirus (AdV). Newly emerging respiratory viral pathogens include swine origin influenza A H1N1, human metapneumovirus (hMPV), and human bocavirus (hBoV) particularly in pediatric patients [Lu et al., 2006; Dare et al., 2007; Gordon, 2009; Scalera and Mossad, 2009]. Immunocompromised hosts such as organ transplant recipients are often infected with opportunistic herpesviruses. Therefore, rapid screening for respiratory viral pathogens is critical to allow timely therapeutic decisions and limit pathogenesis.",

However, though relatively rapid, this technique is limited to detection of only a few of the common respiratory viruses. One of the advancements of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay is multiplex real\u2010time PCR which allows detection of multiple RNA and DNA targets in a single tube [van Elden et al., 2004]. In this study, a multiplex real\u2010time PCR assay was developed targeting respiratory RNA and DNA viruses to assess its utility as a rapid molecular screening tool for clinical diagnosis. With this assay, a variety of respiratory viruses causing symptomatic and asymptomatic infections was identified in organ transplant and non\u2010organ transplant adult and pediatric patients.",

During December 2006\u2013March 2007, residual respiratory specimens received for viral culture/DFA at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Clinical Virology Laboratory, were stored in a lysis buffer for nucleic acid isolation and multiplex PCR testing. A total of 728 specimens were collected from 585 adult and pediatric patients, of whom 258 were organ transplant recipients. Clinical information on all patients was collected for correlation with laboratory data. Upper respiratory tract infection was defined as clinical symptoms of rhinorrhea, sore throat or cough with or without fever, without evidence of dyspnea and abnormalities in chest X\u2010ray. Lower respiratory tract infection was defined as presence of dyspnea and or clinical evidence of pulmonary pathology on chest X\u2010ray along with fever or cough [Machado et al., 2003]. Patients presenting without apparent respiratory symptoms were defined as asymptomatic. Most of these latter specimens were obtained from organ transplant recipients as routine surveillance cultures.

Concentrations of primer and probes for viral targets in each panel were optimized for sensitivity and are shown in Table I. Multiplex PCR reaction mixes were supplemented with 0.1 \u00b5l/reaction of AmpliTaq Gold DNA polymerase. PCR thermal cycling conditions for RNA PCR were optimized to the following conditions: 20 min at 50\u00b0C for reverse transcription, 15 min at 95\u00b0C and 45 cycles of 45 sec at 94\u00b0C, and 1.15 min at 60\u00b0C.

First, similar to other studies [Kim et al., 2009; Murali et al., 2009], the multiplex PCR detected more viruses than viral culture/DFA. The sensitivity of this multiplex PCR was found to be comparable to singleplex PCR for individual viruses and higher than viral culture/DFA detection. The reason for this higher sensitivity is that PCR detects lower titers of viral genomes as well as viruses that are not replication competent [Liolios et al., 2001]. Second, viruses that were not included in the R\u2010mix culture panel such as hMPV, hBoV, HHV\u20106, and hCoV could also be detected by the multiplex PCR assay. Since this study was carried out before the emergence of the swine\u2010origin influenza A H1N1 virus pandemic, our multiplex PCR did not include primers for this target. However in 2009, the multiplex PCR assay was modified for detection of swine\u2010origin influenza A H1N1. We found it to be highly sensitive and specific for detection of the three predominant influenza viruses, that is, using the multiplex PCR assay 2,992 swine H1N1 virus, 324 influenza A H3N2 virus and 300 influenza B virus infections were detected in 18,920 specimens from April, 2009 through April, 2011 (unpublished results). Thus, this multiplex assay can be modified according to the needs of the clinicians and the laboratory to add new viruses in the detection panel following simple optimization and validation studies.",

            "text": "A lower number of respiratory viral infections were noted in immunocompetent compared to immunocompromised adults. It has been suggested that respiratory viral infections in immunocompromised patients differ from immunocompetent patients by higher viral replication leading to increased viral shedding [Leung et al., 2005; Camps Serra et al., 2008]. Compared to some other studies [Templeton et al., 2004; Hindiyeh et al., 2005], our multiplex PCR had relatively lower sensitivity. However, more respiratory viral infections were detected in the symptomatic group than in asymptomatic immunocompetent adults, indicating true active infections. The overall positivity rate of multiplex PCR was 46.5%, which is comparable to that reported by others (Gadsby et al., 2010). Among the positives, 78.4% were from symptomatic patients and 25% from asymptomatic patients. A significant association was also observed between symptomatic respiratory illness and positive viral detection.",

            "text": "Most of the adult patients comprised of immunocompromised organ transplant recipients, while the pediatric patients were mostly non\u2010organ transplant recipients with respiratory complaints. The spectrum of viral isolates differed between adult and pediatric patients as well as between organ transplant and non\u2010transplant recipients. Herpesviral infections CMV, HHV\u20106, and HSV\u20101 were more predominant in adult organ transplant recipients, whereas RSV was present predominantly in pediatric non\u2010transplant patients. These opportunistic herpesviruses were also associated significantly with lower respiratory tract infection in non\u2010organ transplant recipients and apparently immunocompetent hosts. The significance of these herpesviral infections, which are known to cause life\u2010long, latent/reactivated infections, needs to be evaluated further. Detection of RNA transcripts and/or antigens or determining viral load using quantitative PCR for these viruses will help in detecting replicating viruses. These herpesviruses have been reported previously to cause pneumonitis in immunocompetent adults, underlying their role in community\u2010acquired pneumonias [Karakelides et al., 2003; Merk et al., 2005; Rafailidis et al., 2008]. In the present study, RSV was also significantly associated with symptomatic respiratory infections in organ transplant recipients. RSV and other community viral infections have been reported to be important causes of morbidity and mortality in immunocompromised transplant recipients [Muir and Pillay, 1998; Nichols et al., 2001]. It is therefore possible that the conventional viral culture/DFA (R\u2010mix) method missed detection of some viruses causing severe infections in immunocompromised and immunocompetent patients.",

A range of 5\u201340% multiple infections have been reported [Guittet et al., 2003] but the clinical significance of these infections is not well understood. One plausible reason for this could be that residual, persistent viral nucleic acid, particularly viral DNA, from past infection was co\u2010detected by the highly sensitive multiplex PCR assay. In the present study, RSV was found to be associated more often with co\u2010infections in community acquired viral infections. It has been suggested that RSV\u2010associated dual infections usually lead to increased severity of clinical illness [Aberle et al., 2005]. In the adult organ transplant recipients, CMV and HHV\u20106 dual infections and triple infections with CMV, HHV\u20106, and HSV\u20101 were detected more commonly. A detailed study, including virus quantitation, is required to determine the clinical significance of these multiple viral infections.",
