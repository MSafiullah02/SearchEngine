Fluid in the middle ear, accompanied by signs or symptoms of acute infection, usually fever, pain, and a bulging tympanic membrane (TM). There may also be systemic signs such as vomiting, irritability, and pulling at the ears. 2) Otitis media with effusion (OME). Often following AOM, OME is the presence of fluid within the middle ear without the symptoms of acute disease. The symptoms are less severe, and there may be a sense of fullness, pressure, a popping sensation in the ear, mild to moderate intermittent hearing loss, and occasionally, problems with balance. Examination may reveal fluid levels behind the TM, and alteration of the color. There is diminished TM mobility and usually a conductive hearing loss.",

In order to avoid confusion and to standardize terminology in both research and clinical settings, the use of the categories AOM and OME has been recommended [2] .

Eustachian tube dysfunction and the child's susceptibility to recurrent upper respiratory infections are probably the two most significant factors. A child's eustachian tube differs from the adult's in that it is shorter and more horizontal. Mechanical or functional obstruction of the eustachian tube can result in middle ear effusion. There is the possibility that mechanical obstruction from adenoids may cause obstruction of the eustachian tube, and may act as a focus of infection that contributes to edema-causing obstruction. Allergy may cause edema of the mucosa, and nasal obstruction from swollen turbinates may cause sniffing, which alters the pressure in the middle ear. Nose blowing may cause mucus or bacteria to be insufflated into the middle ear [2] .",

The essentials of the otoscope are the head and the handle, which most often has a rechargeable battery or a wall transformer. It is important that a satisfactory power source be available for accurate diagnosis. If a battery-charged handle is used, the expiration date on the battery should be checked and the batteries changed frequently to assure proper function. The head of the otoscope usually contains a magnifying lens and a speculum that may be disposable or reusable. The lightbulb is very important. We prefer the halogen bulb, as it provides the best color rendition and lasts for about 25 hours of continuous use [5] . The clinician should make sure that the light appears white rather than yellow, as the latter color makes the tympanic membrane appear red, resulting in diagnostic errors.",

The amount of pressure required to move a normal TM is very small, approximately 15 to 25 millimeters of water.

Color can be affected by the contents of the middle ear; hence, the membrane can appear yellow if there is pus, or amber or orange from nonpurulent fluid. The most confusing color is red.

Several causes of antimicrobial resistance have been suggested. In addition to the overuse of antibiotics for a variety of conditions, including otitis media, the widespread use of antibiotics in livestock and agriculture may also play an important role in the development and spread of resistant organisms [19\u2022] . The proliferation of a number of antibacterial products, including soaps, lotions, cleaning products, baby items, toothbrushes, bedding, and a host of others, is another factor. In the war against microbes, it appears that the vigorous efforts to destroy the disease-causing organisms have also destroyed those that are beneficial. This process, known as \"selection pressure,\" has created a more favorable environment for those pathogens that cause disease [19\u2022] . Additionally, organisms can mutate or transfer their resistance to other bacteria. Resistance has developed in all of the bacterial pathogens that are the leading cause of AOM [15] . In the 1980s, increasing reports of beta-lactamase-producing Haemophilus pneumoniae and M. catarrhalis appeared in the literature. It was during this time that there was a boom in the development of second-and third-generation cephalosporins. At the present time, approximately 40% of NTHi and 95% to 98% of M. catarrhalis produce this enzyme [15] , which inactivates the beta-lactam ring and renders the beta-lactam antibiotics (penicillins) ineffective. Over the past decade, and perhaps of the greatest concern in the community setting because of the risk of developing invasive disease, S. pneumoniae has become increasingly resistant to both penicillins and erythromycin [4\u2022] . Rates of resistance vary geographically, with the highest rates reported in the South. S. pneumoniae is the leading bacterial cause of meningitis, pneumonia in hospitalized patients, and otitis media, and the second for bloodstream infections. Results of the S. pneumoniae surveillance system can be found at the CDC's Active Bacterial Core Surveillance (ABCs) website [20] . However, this information is currently available from only nine states, and it is likely that resistant organisms are under-reported unless they cause invasive disease.",

While many have addressed this issue, developing true evidence-based reports is exceedingly difficult and requires a thorough understanding of research methodology. Developing these types of reports is often best left to those with a great deal of experience in research, and to panels of experts in the field. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ), previously known as the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR), is now publishing evidence-based reports rather than guidelines. Most recently, the AHRQ evidence-based report on AOM was released [23\u2022,24\u2022,25] , and the OME report was in the process of being completed as this journal went to press. An extremely well-written and useful review of the AOM Report by Rosenfeld, et al. [3\u2022] provides an overview of the methodology, effectiveness of various antimicrobial use, and summary of main conclusions. A brief summary of the conclusions can be found in Table 2 . The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) is in the process of updating guidelines utilizing the AHRQ and other reports for the management of AOM. Other groups concerned about the problem of the increase in resistant organisms have developed evidence-based recommendations for the management of this disease, and a multitude of various guidelines can be found in academic and clinical settings around the country. Some of these recommendations have come from the CDC and the Drug Resistant Streptococcus Pneumoniae Therapeutic Working Group (DRSPTWG) [4\u2022,26] . The recommendations from the CDC Judicious Use of Antibiotic Campaign cover the management of pediatric upper respiratory tract infections, and include otitis media as well as sinusitis, pharyngitis, the common cold, and bronchitis [27] . The majority of these emphasize the importance of accurate diagnosis, initiating therapy with narrowspectrum antibiotics when they are most likely to be effective, and educational efforts directed at both the individual and the community.",

Inability to determine the causative organisms in diseases such as otitis media due to the invasive nature of the procedure to obtain a culture may influence the provider to prescribe a broad-spectrum antibiotic.

Increasingly, the problem of resistance and the need for a decrease in the use of antibiotics is being reported in the media, including television, magazines, and numerous worldwide websites. However, it should also be the responsibility of the health-care provider to communicate to the client and the community the importance of the judicious use of antibiotics and the reasons why an antibiotic may not be appropriate. Part of community education should include childcare centers. Reports of parents coming to the clinic setting with a child who has been told that he or she could not return to daycare until he or she has received an antibiotic are all too common.",

Talk with parents about the fact that children get a number of colds during their first few years of life, and why antibiotics for these colds are not appropriate. Initiating these discussions at the first visit with the family, and reinforcing them throughout well visits is often helpful in decreasing parental anxiety. The inappropriate use of antibiotics can also be discussed with adults during routine screenings and other visits. Educational efforts can be accomplished through the use of handouts, personal interaction, and instructional videos. Many providers make educational videos available in waiting-room areas and in specified exam rooms. Providing patients with a list of accurate Internet resources is also a way of increasing knowledge. The vast availability of information, much of which may be inaccurate, has contributed to patient confusion as to when antibiotics are appropriate. It is a rare occurrence to talk with a health-care provider who has not been confronted with a patient who knows his/her diagnosis based on information obtained from the Internet. The use of educational programs for both health-care providers and the community has resulted in a decrease in resistance in several countries, including Japan [34] . Recent reports have indicated that educational efforts in the US have been effective in decreasing the number of antibiotic prescriptions written [35] .",
