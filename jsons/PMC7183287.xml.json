Estimates of the case fatality rate (CFR) after adjustments for demography and under-ascertainment in China were 1.38% (1.23%-1.53%), with substantially higher rates in older age groups: 6.4% (5.7%-7.2%) in those over 60 years old as compared to 0.32% (0.27%-0.38%) in those under 60 years [4]. Comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension and chronic lung disease have been reported to be associated with a worse outcome and higher CFR [5].

Many countries have categorised people with CF as highly vulnerable to SARS-CoV-2 and have advised \u201cshielding\u201d or \u201ccocooning\u201d (staying at home at all times and avoiding face-to-face contact with anyone outside the household) to try to minimise the risk of people with CF contracting the virus.

The median age was 33 years (range 15-59 years), with only one patient being under 16. 38% had CFRD and 70% were reported to have chronic bacterial pulmonary infection, of which 71% included Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PsA). One was pregnant and has recovered, delivering a healthy baby.

Reasons for non-participation were lack of a national data collection infrastructure, reporting lag, or delays gaining ethics approvals for data sharing. For participating countries, this method of case capture is not exhaustive and may not identify all cases. This may be due to inability to obtain all required data or test results prior to the deadline, or delayed reporting by clinical teams to their respective Registry. Cases where CT scans were highly suggestive of SARS-CoV-2 but the patient had not tested positive for the virus were excluded from this study. In some cases, multiple tests had been performed, but reports of 20-30% false-negative SARS-CoV-2 test rates should be noted [13].
