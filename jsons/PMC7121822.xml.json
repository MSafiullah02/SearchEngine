Oftentimes, viruses have evolved infectious mechanisms that render them innocuous in their reservoir host species that may account for the lack of an immune response, a result of coevolutionary adaptations. However, some viruses may cause disease in some members of the reservoir species depending on the age, genetics, or immune status of the animal. Other viruses replicate slowly and can take months or years to manifest disease, yet healthy-appearing animals can transmit virus to others prior to disease onset.",

            "text": "Microbes play an important role in the health of all vertebrates. Some microbes, termed normal flora, provide nutrients in the gastrointestinal tract and help defend against other pathogenic microbes. A bat pathogen, Tacaribe virus, was discovered during a rabies surveillance program near Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago (Downs et al. 1963). Many Jamaican (Artibeus jamaicensis) and great fruit-eating bats (Artibeus lituratus) were found dead or dying from suspected rabies. However, pathological assessment failed to detect rabies virus and subsequent work led to the isolation of Tacaribe virus from 11 bats. Recent experimental infection of A. jamaicensis with Tacaribe virus caused a disease in some bats that is similar to human South American hemorrhagic fevers, including neurological manifestations, and the virus was cleared by other bats (Cogswell-Hawkinson et al. 2012). Ebolavirus-like viral RNA was detected in many dead insectivorous Schreiber\u2019s bats (Miniopterus schreibersii) collected in Spain, Portugal, and France (Negredo et al. 2011). More recently, several pathogenic microbes were detected in organs of European bats collected post-mortem, including pneumonia and myocarditis associated with members of several bacterial families and a protozoan and gastrointestinal disease associated with Pasteurella multocida and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, trematode infestation, nematodes, and coccidiosis (Muhldorfer et al. 2010, 2011a, b, c). It is unclear if these microbes caused the diseases or were opportunistic pathogens; the difficulties of conducting experimental infections on bats to test Koch\u2019s postulates has hampered disease etiology research.",

When activated by IFN-\u03b1 or IFN-\u03b2, the cell enters an antiviral state and attenuates many of the cellular biochemical pathways needed by viruses for replication, including protein and nucleotide synthesis. It also leads to increased expression of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) proteins, which are essential for T cell responses and transition to the adaptive phase of the immune response. Type III IFNs (IFN-\u03bb) are encoded by up to three genes in mammals (Ifnl1, Ifnl2, Ifnl3) and also play roles in antiviral immune responses, although their functions are less well characterized. Nonetheless, type III interferons were identified in several bat species (Zhou et al. 2011) and likely are important in viral infection management.",

Secondary lymphoid tissues are where microbial antigens are processed and presented to B cells for antibody production and to T cells for activation of various functions. The spleen is a secondary lymphoid organ responsible for controlling blood-borne infections, whereas the lymph nodes control infections of nearby tissues. All tissues have lymphatic vessels providing a conduit for antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and draining lymph fluid to the lymph nodes that act as filters and depots for concentration of antigens and APCs. During infections, the antigen-specific T and B lymphocytes in the lymph nodes have cognate interactions with each other and with APCs, leading to clonal expansion of antigen-specific lymphocytes and activation of the adaptive immune response. Antibodies are produced by the B cells in these lymph nodes and enter the lymphatic vessels or the blood for rapid distribution. Tertiary lymphoid tissues are typically small collections of immune cells distributed within solid organs and are involved in organ-specific infections and can traffic to the regional lymph nodes to participate in T cell and B cell activation.",

However, because it is a pentamer (five IgM molecules covalently linked by a J chain) and has a valency of ten, it has high avidity and interacts with up to ten antigens, leading to complex aggregates that facilitate immune responses. Within days to weeks, IgG antibodies appear in the blood and the IgM response typically wanes. Importantly, during an immune response many of these antigen-specific IgM-secreting B cells undergo two critical events: class switching to IgG, IgA, or IgE, and affinity maturation that leads to antibodies with such high affinity that they effectively bind to antigen irreversibly under physiologic conditions. While IgG is found in the blood, lymph, and tissues, IgA is secreted into the mucosal tissues and is effective in combating infectious agents in those sites. In other mammals, both class switching and affinity maturation are driven by T cells; thus, the occurrence of high-titer antibody of these classes implies T cell participation in bat antibody responses.",

A recent study developed and validated a model of rabies virus transmission in temperate big brown bats (E. fuscus) in Colorado (George et al. 2011). Seasonal mechanisms were important in the maintenance and transmission of rabies virus within bat populations. Because of the long incubation period of rabies viruses and the low mortality of bats during hibernation, infected bats survive into the next season as a reservoir for transmission to other bats, particularly naive juveniles, in the spring and summer. As juvenile mortality increased, transmission declined within the population. Thus, the combination of long incubation of rabies virus and lack of biochemical activity of the virus during hibernation likely contributes to some bats remaining persistently infected for years. Because of the diversity of bat ecology, it is likely that lyssavirus transmission and maintenance will vary substantially between bat species.",

More than 8,000 cases were reported in 32 countries with a nearly 10 % fatality rate (Field 2009). Chinese investigators initially believed the host was either the masked palm civet (Paguma larvata) or the raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides) because SARS-CoV-like viruses were isolated from these animals in local live animal \u201cwet markets\u201d (Ksiazek et al. 2003).

The prevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV was as high as 84 % in bat populations. While the genotypes of the bat coronaviruses were distinct from the human SARS-CoV, and thus named SARS-like coronaviruses, phylogenetic evaluation indicated the human SARS-CoV was likely descendent from the bat virus. Since, new coronaviruses have been identified in other bat species. A recent outbreak of another coronavirus disease in humans Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), was associated with a virus with substantial phylogenetic similarity to coronaviruses isolated from bats in Southeast Asia (van Boheemen et al. 2012), suggesting transmission to humans is a continuing threat. The risk of contracting coronavirus infection from handling bats appears to be low; however, additional studies are needed to fully understand the risks to bat biologists (Stockman et al. 2008).",

A similar disease occurred near Nipah, Malaysia, in 1998 at a hog farm that killed hogs and ethnic Chinese abattoir workers. Of 256 cases, 105 people died and over one million hogs were euthanized, at a cost of US$500 million, to prevent further spread of the new paramyxovirus, Nipah virus. Another outbreak occurred in Bangladesh with a high number of cases and fatality rate. Together, these viruses were classified into a new genus, Henipavirus, and members have also been detected in Africa. Each virus has been associated with pteropid bats, including the black flying fox (Pteropus alecto), gray-headed flying fox (P. poliocephalus), little red flying fox (P. scapulatus), and spectacled flying fox (P. conspicillatus). Subsequently, other paramyxoviruses have been discovered in bat species from other continents (Kurth et al. 2012; Sasaki et al. 2012; Wilkinson et al. 2012).",

Maternal antibody was present in juveniles and persisted up to 14 months. Of particular concern for captive populations, some bats were seropositive, then seronegative, only to become seropositive again after many months, and virus was isolated from one of these bats.

Antibodies to ebolaviruses were also detected in other bats of these species but viral RNA was not detected in those bats, suggesting the immune responses cleared the virus or reduced viral loads to levels undetectable by PCR. A large serological survey for antibodies specific to filoviruses conducted in Gabon detected antibodies in Egyptian fruit bats, although five other bat species had a lower prevalence. RNA from an eighth ebolavirus-like virus, Lloviu virus, was detected in tissues from dead Schreiber\u2019s bats collected in Spain, Portugal, and France (Negredo et al. 2011).

In particular, cell cultures can identify subsets of T cells and their cytokines that are active during immune responses, but their cultivation from outbred animals can be daunting and the lack of colonies of bats for experimental infections makes such work difficult. Nonetheless, it may be possible to cultivate virus-specific T cells provided two important cytokines are available: interleukin-2 (IL-2) for propagating T cells and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) for propagating autologous antigen-presenting cells from the bone marrow. Each of these cytokines is cross-reactive in many species. For example, human IL-2 can be used to propagate Mus musculus T cells.",
