            "text": "Respiratory disease in swine, as with other species, is generally considered a multifactorial problem caused by a combination of viral and bacterial infectious agents, as well as adverse environmental conditions. The list of infectious agents that cause respiratory disease in swine is extensive and includes both viral agents, such as porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), swine influenza virus (SIV) and porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV); and bacterial agents, such as Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae, Bordetella bronchiseptica, Pasteurella multocida and Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae. Although any one of these pathogens can potentially cause disease on its own, more serious and chronic respiratory disease results, and more economic losses are incurred, when infection with multiple pathogens occurs. Although the multifactorial nature of respiratory disease is well accepted, the specific mechanisms by which respiratory pathogens interact with each other or the host to cause more severe disease are poorly understood.",

            "text": "Coronaviruses are enveloped, single-stranded, RNA viruses which cause respiratory and enteric disease in animals, including the common cold and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in humans. Porcine respiratory coronavirus is a naturally occurring deletion mutant of transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGE), an enteric coronavirus of swine (Rasschaert et al., 1990, Britton et al., 1991, Wesley et al., 1991). A deletion in the spike gene of TGE has altered the tropism of PRCV from primarily enteric to primarily respiratory in nature. Although experimentally PRCV has been shown to cause bronchointersitial pneumonia, the clinical relevance of this virus has been debated, since many farms seroconvert without overt clinical signs of disease. What role, if any, PRCV plays in multifactorial respiratory disease is still being investigated. Prior work has shown that exposure to PRCV decreases replication of SIV, in vivo, and mixed results have been reported with coinfections of PRCV and PRRSV (Van Reeth and Pensaert, 1994, Van Reeth and Nauwynck, 2000). However, experimental exposure of pigs to bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) following PRCV infection led to more severe respiratory disease and increased tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin (IL)-1 levels than exposure to either LPS or PRCV alone (Van Reeth et al., 2000). Thus, infection with PRCV and gram-negative bacteria may result in a more severe disease.",

Although B. bronchiseptica can cause pneumonia in neonatal pigs and rhinitis and bronchitis in older swine on its own, its role in multifactorial disease is also under investigation. Prior infection with B. bronchiseptica in swine has led to increased colonization and more severe disease with other bacterial agents such as P. multocida, Streptococcus suis and Haemophilus parasuis (Chanter et al., 1989, Vecht et al., 1992, Brockmeier et al., 2001, Brockmeier, 2004), and coinfection of B. bronchiseptica with PRRSV in swine exacerbated clinical disease and induced B bronchiseptica pneumonia (Brockmeier et al., 2000).",

            "text": "The innate immune response of the lung is not only important for initial protection from infectious agents and stimulation of the adaptive immune response, but the nature of the innate response can dictate the character of the pathology observed and the outcome of infection. Proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-alpha, IL-1 and IL-6, as well as the chemokines IL-8 and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) are often produced after recognition of pathogen associated molecular patterns for early host protection and recruitment of effector cells. Exposure to multiple infectious agents may result in distinct cytokine patterns and thus alter the severity of disease compared to that observed during infection with individual agents. In this report we determine whether coinfection with PRCV and B. bronchiseptica leads to increased severity of respiratory disease, and if so, whether or not the local proinflammatory cytokine response helps to elucidate the mechanism of this interaction. The data reported here demonstrates that coinfection results in a proinflammatory response that is different from each individual infection, and this proinflammatory response likely contributes to the differences in disease pathology observed during infection with PRCV and B. bronchiseptica.",

All 12 pigs in the coinfected group had pneumonic lesions, whereas only 7 pigs in the PRCV group and 3 pigs in the B. bronchiseptica group had gross lesions; the largest difference being at the 1-day time point. Again, lesions were more severe, in general, at 10 days post-infection, except for the group of pigs infected with PRCV alone, in which lesions peaked at 4 days post-infection.",

Microscopic lesions of the lung of pigs infected with PRCV alone typically consisted of multifocal areas of moderate to severe interstitial thickening of alveoli with mononuclear cells and lymphocytic perivascular and peribronchiolar infiltrates. These changes tended to be more pronounced on day 10 after challenge as compared to day 4, but at day 4 there were mild infiltrates of neutrophils in some of the airways that were not present on day 10 (Fig. 2). Microscopic lesions in coinfected pigs included changes seen in pigs infected with single agents but also included additional changes and tended to be more severe than pigs infected with either agent alone. Typical microscopic lesions of the lung of pigs infected with both PRCV and B. bronchiseptica consisted of multifocal areas of moderate to severe interstitial thickening of the alveoli with mononuclear cells, lymphocytic perivascular and peribronchiolar cuffing, intra-alveolar epithelial cell necrosis with type II pneumocyte hyperplasia, and syncycial cell formation. Intra-alveolar aggregates of neutrophils, macrophages, epithelial cells and necrotic debris were also present in coinfected pigs, as well as, accumulations of neutrophils in the bronchi and bronchioles, terminal bronchiolar epithelial cell necrosis and flattening, interlobular edema and occasional hemorrhage (Fig. 2). Again, these changes tended to be more pronounced on day 10 post-infection. Three of the control animals had mild microscopic lesions consisting of peribronchial and perivascular infiltrates of lymphocytes, macrophages and eosinophils. Bronchoalveolar lavage was tested by PCR for the presence of Mycoplasma, and none was detected (data not shown).",

Fifty percent or more of the pigs had a greater than 2-fold reduction in transcript detected for IL-6, MCP-1, IL-8 and IL-1beta.

Although the increase in mRNA levels were similar to that of pigs infected with B. bronchiseptica alone, the mRNA levels of TNF-alpha, IL-8, IL-6 and IL-1beta were significantly greater in coinfected pigs when compared to PRCV infected pigs.

These three pigs had the largest percentage of lung affected by macroscopic lesions, more severe microscopic lesions, and both B. bronchiseptica and PRCV were isolated from the lung, while the one pig that did not have an increase in MCP-1 transcript had the fewest lesions and no B. bronchiseptica or PRCV isolated from its lungs.

Although any pathogen by itself may cause disease, it is not uncommon for multiple agents to be involved in respiratory disease. Interactions among multiple pathogens often appear to generate a more severe or chronic outcome than is observed with the individual pathogens by themselves, but little is known about the specific interactions. In both experiments performed in this study, coinfection with PRCV and B. bronchiseptica resulted in a higher percentage of the lung, on average, affected by pneumonia and an increased severity of microscopic lesions of pneumonia as compared to pigs infected with either pathogen by itself. The increased severity of gross and microscopic lesions at day 1 post-infection indicate that lesions developed earlier in coinfected pigs than in pigs infected with either agent alone. In addition, the increased severity of lesions in coinfected pigs at day 10 post-infection, a time when lesions should be resolving, suggests there was also a delay in resolution of the lesions compared to pigs infected with virus or bacteria alone. It is unlikely that lesions observed in coinfected animals were solely an additive effect, since the percentage of lung affected in the coinfected group was greater than the combined effect of the single infected groups. Furthermore, microscopic lesions in coinfected pigs were not just a combination of those induced by PRCV or B. bronchiseptica alone, as new lesions not observed in pigs infected with either pathogen alone were observed.",

Previous studies have indicated that parasitic infections can alter the response to bacterial and viral infections. For example, aerosol exposure to P. multocida in mice with migrating Ascaris suum larvae developed more severe pneumonia than Ascaris free mice (Tjornehoj et al., 1992), and coinfection with Schistosoma mansoni and vaccinia virus resulted in a decreased antiviral Th1 response and delayed viral clearance in mice (Actor et al., 1993). A. suum, the probable cause of the lesions seen in the pigs in the first experiment, has also been shown to skew the adaptive immune response to a Th2 type response (Dawson et al., 2005). Thus, the increased isolation of B. bronchiseptica and PRCV, the appearance of mild microscopic lesions in control pigs, and the increased severity of microscopic lesions in coinfected pigs that were all seen in the first experiment as compared to the second, may be attributed to the resolving ascarid migration that was evident in these pigs.

This was likely an acute response to B. bronchiseptica LPS in the inoculum. Little increase in cytokine transcriptional response was noted after day 1 in these pigs. In fact, at day 4 there appeared to be a down regulation of most of the cytokines examined. It is likely that the bacteria were largely cleared from the lungs of these pigs and few, if any, lesions were seen. The one exception was a pig on day 10 that had significant lung lesions affecting an estimated 11% of the lung and had increased TNF-alpha, IL-6, and MCP-1 mRNA. In this regard, at days 4 and 10 post-infection, lesions correlated to increased cytokine responses. Previous research in mice shows that IL-6 and TNF-alpha are induced in bone marrow derived macrophages 24 h after exposure, as well as in lung homogenates 12 h after exposure, to B. bronchiseptica in a toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) dependent manner (Mann et al., 2004a).

These results agree with those of a previous study which found no increase in the bioactive levels of TNF-alpha or IL-1 in the BALF of PRCV infected pigs up to 4 days after infection (Van Reeth et al., 1999). The results reported here are also similar to a recent report describing responses to SARS coronavirus in humans (Law et al., 2005). Human dendritic cells responded to SARS coronavirus with low expression of the antiviral cytokines (IFN-alpha, IFN-beta, IFN-gamma and IL-12) and proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6 and TNF-alpha), but large increases in CXC chemokines that preferentially act on mononuclear cells (MIP-1\u03b1, RANTES, IP-10 and MCP-1). Of these CXC chemokines, induction was strongest for MCP-1 and IP-10. Additionally, MCP-1 was also found to be elevated in SARS patients as well (Huang et al., 2005). MCP-1 is important for the recruitment and activation of macrophages and has been shown to influence viral load in an influenza model (Dawson et al., 2000). The increase in MCP-1 in 1 pig at day 1 seemed to be positively correlated with microscopic lesions seen in that pig, while at 10 days post-infection the pig with the largest percentage of lung affected had no increase in MCP-1, and the other 3 pigs all had significant increases in this cytokine and little to no lung lesions. Thus, lesions at 10 days post-infection seemed to be inversely correlated with the level of MCP-1 produced.",

            "text": "On day 1 post-infection, the cytokine response in coinfected pigs was most like that of pigs infected with B. bronchiseptica alone, in that there was a general increase in the transcriptional response to all cytokines tested. Again, this may largely be due to the response to bacterial LPS. However, unlike the pigs that were challenged with bacteria alone, bacteria were isolated from some of the coinfected pigs and lesions were seen in all of the coinfected pigs as compared to pigs infected with bacteria or virus alone. The coinfected pigs responded with an increase to more cytokines per pig and quantitatively greater, on average, to IL-6 and MCP-1, than did pigs infected with the bacteria alone. This might explain the increase in the severity of lesions observed early in the coinfected pigs compared to the pigs infected with bacteria or virus alone. Whether or not this early cytokine response in coinfected pigs, which was not typical of pigs infected with the virus alone, might have altered the host response to PRCV resulting in the decreased clearance of the virus observed in the second experiment, warrants further investigation.",

A previously proposed hypothesis suggested that proinflammatory cytokines, particularly TNF-alpha, produced during exposure to PRCV and bacterial LPS might be responsible for more severe clinical respiratory signs in pigs (Van Reeth et al., 2000). Although the results reported here do not point specifically to TNF-alpha, the lung lesions in coinfected pigs support this hypothesis. In another study, exposing human macrophages to SARS coronavirus and subsequent suboptimal LPS led to a dramatic increase in IL-6 over what was observed with cells exposed to either virus or LPS alone (Tseng et al., 2005). Overall, the data presented here does not implicate a single cytokine or chemokine in causing more severe lung disease in coinfected animals than in PRCV or B. bronchiseptica infection alone.",

            "text": "Ultimately, the early interaction of pathogens with the innate immune system and its subsequent influence on the adaptive immune response is critical in determining the outcome of infection. The host has evolved specific mechanisms to deal with diverse classes of pathogens in order to induce the most effective response. In addition to the innate mechanisms, such as epithelial barriers, muco-ciliary clearance, and antimicrobial substances, that are ubiquitously and constitutively present, innate responses induced through TLR receptors, which recognize conserved molecular patterns present in microorganisms, can stimulate specific responses to different pathogens. For example, neutrophils usually dominate the initial inflammatory infiltrate subsequent to bacterial infections, while viral infection is often characterized by primarily mononuclear infiltration. In this study, the cytokine response in coinfected pigs was unique compared to the cytokine response in pigs infected with either agent by itself, suggesting that the alteration in the innate response, which has developed over time to deal with these pathogens, may be one mechanism through which coinfection alters the disease outcome.",
