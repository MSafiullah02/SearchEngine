In particular, the number of T cells and CD8+ T cells was lower in patients with severe disease than in cases with mild disease. Moreover, NK-cell counts were reduced remarkably in severe cases as compared with mild disease patients and healthy controls.14 In parallel, besides having a decrease in the numbers of these cells, patients with Covid-19 infection displayed a functional exhaustion of NK and CD8+ T cells. Of note, exhausted NK and CD8+ T cells showed an increased expression of the CD94/NK group 2 member A (NKG2A) receptor. Interestingly, in patients convalescing after therapy, the number of NK and CD8+ T cells was restored, and concomitantly their NKG2A expression was markedly reduced.14 These findings allow to hypothesize that the functional exhaustion of cytotoxic lymphocytes associated with COVID-19 infection breaks down the antiviral immunity, and that the enhanced expression of NKG2A, as specifically observed in CD8+ and NK cells, could contribute to the maintenance of this blunted antiviral surveillance.",

In parallel, the increased release of cytokines (IL-6 and IL-10) in COVID-19 patients could exacerbate this immune cell disproportion, eliciting an upregulation of NKG2A expression, with a subsequent increment of its inhibitory action on the lymphocyte component, thus compromising the balance between lymphocytes and neutrophils (Fig. 1). In parallel, this scenario could be worsened further by the presence of high IL-6 and IL-8 levels, which can enhance the neutrophil infiltration and activity,23,24 while holding an inhibitory action on NK cells20(Fig. 1).",

In parallel, promising and encouraging options are emerging from the field of immunotherapy, which makes use of the components of our immune system to modulate or boost its response. In this regard, based on the above knowledge, monalizumab, a first-in-class humanized IgG4 targeting the NKG2A receptors expressed on cytotoxic NK and CD8+ T lymphocytes, might be able to release the brake on these cells, leading to the restoration of an adequate antiviral activity through an increase in the production of IFN-\u03b3.25 Of note, the restoration of NK and CD8+ cell functions could allow a reorganization of the immune cell pool, which is known to undergo a remarkable unsettlement mainly in the severe cases of COVID-19 infection.",
