The function of the coat is to protect the genome of the virus in the extracellular environment as well as to bind to a new host cell and introduce the genome into it. Viral genomes are small and limited in their coding capacity, which requires that three-dimensional virions be formed using a limited number of different proteins. For the smallest viruses, only one protein may be used to construct the virion, whereas the largest viruses may use 30 or more proteins. To form a three-dimensional structure using only a few proteins requires that the structure must be regular, with each protein subunit occupying a position at least approximately equivalent to that occupied by all other proteins of its class in the final structure (the principle of quasi-equivalence), although some viruses are now known to violate the principle of quasi-equivalence. A regular three-dimensional structure can be formed from repeating subunits using either helical symmetry or icosahedral symmetry principles. In the case of the smallest viruses, the final structure is simple and quite regular. Larger viruses with more proteins at their disposal can build more elaborate structures. Enveloped viruses may be quite regular in construction or may have irregular features, because the use of lipid envelopes allows irregularities in construction.",

The bond angle between the two subunits of the dimer is more acute in the AB dimers than in the CC dimers (Figs. 2.6B and C). For the plant viruses, there are N-terminal and C-terminal extensions from the capsid proteins that are involved in interactions between the subunits and with the RNA. The N-terminal extensions have a positively charged, disordered domain for interacting with and neutralizing the charge on the RNA and a connecting arm that interacts with other subunits. In the case of the CC dimers, the connecting arms interdigitate with two others around the icosahedral threefold axis to form an interconnected internal framework. In the case of the AB conformational dimer, the arms are disordered, allowing sharper curvature. For flock house virus, the RNA plays a role in controlling the curvature of the CC dimers, as illustrated in Fig. 2.6.",

Both viruses possess pseudo-T=7 icosahedral symmetry. Although T=7 symmetry would require 420 subunits, these viruses contain only 360 copies of a major structural protein known as VP1. These 360 copies are assembled as 72 pentamers. Twelve of the 72 pentamers lie on the fivefold axes and the remaining 60 fill the intervening surface in a closely packed array (Fig. 2.10\n). These latter pentamers are thus sixfold coordinated and the proteins in the shell are not all in quasi-equivalent positions, a surprising finding for our understanding of the principles by which viruses can be constructed. The pentamers are stabilized by interactions of the \u03b2 sheets between adjacent monomers in a pentamer (Fig. 2.10C). The pentamers are then tied together by C-terminal arms of VP1 that invade monomers in an adjacent pentamer (Figs. 2.10B and C). Because each pentamer that is sixfold coordinated has five C-terminal arms to interact with six neighboring pentamers, the interactions between monomers in different pentamers are not all identical (Fig. 2.10B). Flexibility in the C-terminal arm allows it to form contacts in different ways.",

It is formed by 120 copies of a single protein, called VP3. These 120 copies have been described as forming a T=2 lattice. Because T=2 is not a permitted triangulation number, these 120 copies, strictly speaking, form a T=1 lattice in which each unit of the lattice is composed of two copies of VP3. However, the interactions are not symmetrical, leading to the suggested terminology of T=2.",

The structures of alphaviruses and flaviviruses are related and have descended from a common ancestral structure. Like alphaviruses, flaviviruses produce two structural glycoproteins, called E and prM (for precursor to M). E is homologous to E1 of alphaviruses. Although no sequence identity is detectable, the structures of the two proteins are virtually identical and are formed with a similar fold (Fig. 2.17\n). prM and E form a heterodimer and immature particles can be formed if cleavage of prM is prevented. The glycoprotein heterodimers in these immature particles trimerize to form spikes whose structure is very similar to the spikes of alphaviruses (Fig. 2.15B). The arrangement of the glycoproteins on the immature virus particle is illustrated in Fig. 2.18A\nand a cryoEM reconstruction that illustrates the surface of the immature dengue virus particle is shown in Fig. 2.18D. The major differences between the immature flavivirus particle and the alphavirus particle are that there are 180 copies of the heterodimer in the flavivirus particle arranged in a T=3 icosahedral structure rather than 240 heterodimers arranged in a T=4 structure in alphaviruses; that prM is a smaller molecule than PE2 so that in the flavivirus spike there is but a thin trace of density that projects downward, parallel to E, from the cap that shields the fusion peptide (Fig. 2.15B) rather than a substantial trace of density in the alphavirus spike (Fig. 2.15A); and that the C-terminal regions of prM and E that enter the membrane do so independently and do not emerge from the internal side of the membrane (illustrated in Fig. 2.19B\n), unlike the alphavirus membrane spanning regions (Fig. 2.16). There is no evidence that the membrane glycoproteins interact with the nucleocapsid in flaviviruses, and the flavivirus nucleocapsid, assuming it is a regular icosahedral structure, is not coordinated with the icosahedral structure formed by the spikes, which is again different from alphaviruses where the C-terminal domain of PE2 interacts with the nucleocapsid.",

There is a matrix protein M (M1) lining the inside of the lipid bilayer and also two glycoproteins anchored in the bilayer that form external spikes. The two glycoproteins, called F and HN in paramyxoviruses and HA and NA in orthomyxoviruses, do not form heterodimers but rather form homooligomers so that there are two different kinds of spikes on the surface of the virions. HA in the orthomyxoviruses forms homotrimers whereas NA forms homotetramers, and the two types of spikes can be distinguished in the electron microscope if the resolution is high enough. As occurs in many enveloped RNA viruses, F and HA are produced as precursors that are cleaved by furin during transport of the proteins. Cleavage is required to activate the fusion peptide of the virus, which is found at the N terminus of the C-terminal product (see Fig. 1.6). Electron micrographs of virions are shown in Figs. 2.22C and D. The particles in the preparations shown are round and reasonably uniform, but in other preparations the virions are pleomorphic baglike structures that are not uniform in appearance. In fact, clinical specimens of some orthomyxoviruses and paramyxoviruses are often filamentous rather than round, illustrating the flexible nature of the structure of the virion. The micrograph of the paramyxovirus measles virus shown in Fig. 2.22C is a thin section and illustrates the lack of higher order structure in the internal helical nucleocapsid. The micrograph of the orthomyxovirus influenza A virus shown in Fig. 2.22D is of a negative-stained preparation and illustrates the spikes that decorate the virus particle.",

Many of these cleavages are effected by viral proteases, whereas others are performed by cellular proteases present in subcellular organelles. Virions are formed by the spontaneous assembly of components in the infected cell, sometimes with the aid of assembly factors (\u201cscaffolds\u201d) that do not form components of the mature virion. For most nonenveloped viruses, complete assembly occurs within the cell cytoplasm or nucleoplasm. For enveloped viruses, final assembly of the virus occurs by budding through a cellular membrane. In either case, the virion must subsequently disassemble spontaneously on infection of a new cell. The cleavages that occur during assembly of the virus potentiate penetration of a susceptible cell after binding of the virus to it, and the subsequent disassembly of the virion on entry into the cell.

Cleavage to produce VP4, which is found within the interior of the capsid shell, as illustrated schematically in Fig. 2.9, is required for the virus to be infectious. As described in Chapter 1, VP4 appears to be required for entry of the virus into the cell. This maturation cleavage has another important consequence. Whereas the provirion is quite unstable, the mature virion is very stable. The poliovirus virion will survive treatment with proteolytic enzymes and detergents, and survives exposure to the acidic pH of less than 2 that is present in the stomach. Only on binding to its receptor (Figs. 1.5 and 2.9) is poliovirus destabilized such that VP4 can be released for entry of the viral RNA into the host cell.",

During assembly of retroviruses, the Gag and Gag\u2013Pol precursor polyproteins are incorporated, together with the viral RNA, into a precursor nucleocapsid. These polyproteins must be cleaved into several pieces by a protease present in the polyprotein if the virus is to be infectious. These cleavages often visibly alter the structure of the particle as seen in the electron microscope (Fig. 2.21). An analogous situation occurs in adenoviruses, where a viral protease processes a protein precursor in the core of the immature virion.",

This cleavage may occur prior to budding, catalyzed by a host enzyme called furin, or may occur after release of the virus, catalyzed by other host enzymes. The example of the hemagglutinin of influenza virus was described in Chapter 1. This protein is produced as a precursor called HA0, which is cleaved to HA1 and HA2 (Fig. 1.6). Cleavage is required to potentiate the fusion activity present at the N terminus of HA2. As a second example, alphaviruses produce two envelope glycoproteins that form a heterodimer and one of the glycoproteins is produced as a precursor, as described before. The heterodimer containing the uncleaved precursor is quite stable, so that a particle containing uncleaved heterodimer is not infectious. The cleaved heterodimer, which is required for virus entry, is much less stable and dissociates readily during infection. Thus, in contrast to the poliovirus maturation cleavage, the alphavirus cleavage makes the virion less stable rather than more stable. Maturation cleavages also occur in the envelope glycoproteins of retroviruses, paramyxoviruses, flaviviruses, and coronaviruses.",

In many viruses, positively charged polymers are incorporated that neutralize half or so of the nucleic acid charge. The DNA in the virions of the polyomaviruses is complexed with cellular histones. The viral genomes in these viruses have been referred to as minichromosomes. In contrast, the adenoviruses encode their own basic proteins that complex with the genome in the core of the virion. Another strategy is used by the herpesviruses, which incorporate polyamines into the virion. Herpes simplex virus has been estimated to incorporate 70,000 molecules of spermidine and 40,000 molecules of spermine, which would be sufficient to neutralize about 40% of the DNA charge. Among RNA viruses, the nucleocapsid proteins are often quite basic and neutralize part of the charge on the RNA. As one example, the N-terminal 110 amino acids of the capsid protein of Sindbis virus have a net positive charge of 29. The positive charges within this domain of the 240 capsid proteins in a nucleocapsid would be sufficient to neutralize about 60% of the charge on the RNA genome. This charged domain is thought to penetrate into the interior of the nucleocapsid and complex with the viral RNA.",

Viruses that must persist in the extracellular environment for considerable periods, for example, must be more stable than viruses that pass quickly from one host to the next. As an example of such requirements, consider the closely related polioviruses and rhinoviruses, members of two different genera of the family Picornaviridae. These viruses shared a common ancestor in the not too distant past and have structures that are very similar. The polioviruses are spread by an oral\u2013fecal route and have the ability to persist in a hostile extracellular environment for some time where they may contaminate drinking water or food. Furthermore, they must pass through the stomach, where the pH is less than 2, to reach the intestinal tract where they begin the infection cycle. It is not surprising, therefore, that the poliovirion is stable to storage and to treatments such as exposure to mild detergents or to pH < 2. In contrast, rhinoviruses are spread by aerosols or contaminated mucus, and spread normally requires close contact. The rhinovirion is less stable than the poliovirion. It survives for only a limited period of time in the external environment and is sensitive to treatment with detergents or exposure to pH 3.",
