The authors address 2 key points. First is that we have an inadequate workforce in training, especially in low-income countries such as Brazil, and second, higher-income countries do not have easy pathways for training international graduates. While assertively discussing these individual points, the cumulative summary is the end point that more fully trained CT surgeons are needed to address pending universal shortages.",

Unfilled positions have allocated funding and educational organization in place that should be maximized. Academic partnerships and educational assistance, in the stated countries like Ecuador without any training program, could be of value. Notably, such partnerships can be fraught with red tape surrounding funding, licensing, credentialing, and even immigration. The international workforce shortage will need to be addressed at all levels from the leaders of the specialty to interested medical students and trainees across the world. Match day should be a time when a specialty as unique as CT surgery should not go unfilled and no future CT surgeon go unmatched.",
