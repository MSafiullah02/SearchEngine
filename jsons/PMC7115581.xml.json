            "text": "Varicella zoster virus (VZV) is a ubiquitous and highly infectious human virus that belongs to the herpesviridae family. It is classified within the group of \u03b1-herpesviruses which also includes herpes simplex virus (HSV) [1]. A VZV primary infection leads to acute varicella or \u201cchickenpox\u201d, while reactivation of latent virus, established in cranial nerve and dorsal root ganglia, causes herpes zoster (shingles). The course of varicella is generally benign in immune-competent children, but can cause severe morbidity and mortality in adults and in immune-compromised individuals [2]. Complications of herpes zoster in immune-competent hosts include post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN), a persistent pain syndrome, which is the most challenging complication particularly in older individuals [2], [3]. Central nervous system (CNS) complications can follow both primary infection and reactivation of VZV [4], [5]. The most serious manifestations arise when VZV invades the spinal cord or cerebral arteries after reactivation of the virus, causing diseases such as myelitis and focal vasculopathies [2], [4], [5]. Other neurological complications of herpes zoster include motor neuropathy, particularly in patients with zoster ophthalmicus [6], [7]. In patients with the acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), transplant recipients, and cancer patients, VZV infection can be associated with severe acute retinal necrosis (ARN), a disease with poor prognosis [8], [9]. The outcomes of varicella and herpes zoster have been dramatically improved by the development of safe and effective antiviral drugs with potent activity against VZV [10]. Three oral guanine-based antivirals are approved worldwide for the treatment of VZV-associated diseases: acyclovir, valacyclovir, and famciclovir [11]. The thymidine analog brivudin has been licensed for the therapy of herpes zoster in some European and Central American countries [12]. These drugs are (a) nucleoside analogs that after predominant phosphorylation by the virus-encoded thymidine kinases (TKs), act as competitive inhibitors of the viral DNA polymerase or alternate substrates to the natural triphosphates, inhibiting DNA replication [13]. Other anti-VZV nucleoside inhibitors such as the stearyl/valyl diester valomaciclovir and the valyl-ester prodrug of the bicyclic nucleoside analog (BCNA) FV100 are under clinical investigation [14], [15], [16], [17].",

            "text": "One of the limitations of the use of nucleoside derivatives is the emergence of single and multiple drug resistance which could be partially avoided with the use of non nucleoside compounds [18], [19]. A drug of choice for treatment of acyclovir-resistant VZV disease is foscarnet, a direct inhibitor of viral DNA polymerase that is not dependent on viral TK for activation [20], [21], [22]. A number of small molecules have been identified and reported as potent and selective VZV inhibitors with different mechanisms of action. Some examples are the 4-oxo-dihydroquinoline [23] and 4-oxo-dihydrothieno [2,3-b]pyridine derivatives [24] as inhibitors of the viral DNA polymerases, the oxadiazolephenyl derivative (ASP2151) as a helicase-primase inhibitor [25], and N-\u03b1-methylbenzyl-N\u2032-arylthiourea derivatives that interfere with the function of the viral ORF54 protein, impairing morphogenesis of the capsid [26], [27]. Finally, a series of 4-benzyloxy-\u03b3-sultone derivatives has been also reported as non-selective VZV inhibitors with unknown mechanism of action [28]. Given the difficulty of identifying initial hit compounds in this field, where the synthesized compounds are in primis subject to a cellular screening, we considered of interest to use a privileged scaffold as effective starting point in the search for anti-VZV ligands [29]. Indole and its bioisosteres, as privileged scaffolds, represent one of the most important structural motifs in drug discovery [30], [31], [32], and it is widely used in antiviral research [32], [33]. Arbidol [34] and delavirdine [35], are examples of marketed indole-containing antiviral drugs, whereas Panobinostat (LBH589) [36], being a HDAC (histone deacetylase) inhibitor, is actively undergoing clinical evaluation against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 (See Fig. 1\n).",

In fact, the N-biphenylethyl acetamide derivative 17a displayed an interesting inhibition against VZV and was endowed with a selectivity of 10\u201320 (ratio CC50/EC50). It must be also considered that 17a showed similar activity against TK+ and TK- VZV strains, thus indicating a mechanism of action independent from the virus-encoded thymidine kinase. Additionally, this compound is able to exert antiviral activity exclusively on VZV, being totally inactive against other members of Herpesviridae family as well as against a wide variety of RNA virus strains suggesting a selective action on a specific antiviral target untargeted by the currently existing compounds. The possible mechanism of action of this novel class of compounds will be further investigated.",
