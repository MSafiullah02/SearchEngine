            "text": "Critically ill patients are at increased risk of fungal infections. Candida and Aspergillus are the most frequently isolated fungi in the intensive care unit (ICU). In fact, Candida is the third most prevalent microorganism in patients with infections the ICU [1]. It is responsible for 12% of ICU-acquired bloodstream infections [2]. Nosocomial Candida bloodstream infection (CBSI) is associated with increased morbidity and mortality as well as a prolonged hospital length of stay compared with other bloodstream infections [3]. Crude mortalities of 40\u201360% and attributable mortalities of 5\u201371% have been reported in patients with Candida infection in the ICU [4\u20136]. Invasive aspergillosis (IA) has typically been described in patients with hematological malignancies and profound immunosuppression, but recent evidence has suggested that it may be present in a significant proportion of critically ill patients without these conventional risk factors [7]. Researchers in previous studies have reported a 1\u20132% prevalence of Aspergillus [8\u201311] in the respiratory tract of mechanically ventilated patients and up to 8% in those with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) [12]. In an autopsy series of patients who died of ARDS, a prevalence of 12.5% was described [13]. Even in the absence of hematological malignancy, isolation of Aspergillus in critically ill patients has been associated with mortality as high as 86% [14].",

It is now routinely used to support critically ill patients with severe respiratory or cardiac failure in whom conventional therapies have failed. The severity of their illness and blood circuit interactions are thought to impair their immune system. They have catheters, cannulas, and oxygenators that can become colonized with microorganisms. They are often treated with broad-spectrum antibacterial agents. These factors are thought to predispose them to fungal colonization and infection. Recently reported data suggest that up to 15% of all bloodstream infections while on ECMO are of fungal origin [16]. A 6.4% prevalence of CBSI in an Australian center has been reported [17]. In another study, yeast DNA was retrieved in 7% of oxygenators after weaning [18].",

These data are more in line with the 7.2% prevalence found in an Australian ICU in a review of their ECMO cases between 2005 and 2011 [20]. There was a much lower prevalence of Aspergillus involvement in the ELSO registry. The first caveat in interpreting the rates of Aspergillus involvement is that microscopic examination and culture of respiratory tract specimens have a combined sensitivity of only 50% for IA [21]. Second, discriminating between colonization and infection is always challenging without histology. Biopsies are rarely performed in ECMO patients, because they are at high risk of bleeding owing to systemic anticoagulation, platelet and coagulation factor consumption, and increased fibrinolysis associated with the extracorporeal circuit. Nonneutropenic patients most often do not display the characteristic radiological signs of IA [22]. Furthermore, many patients had respiratory failure with already abnormal chest imaging results before developing IA. Newer tests such as galactomannan and PCR of serum or bronchoalveolar lavage specimens have been developed to improve the diagnostic yield for IA [23]. However, results of such tests, if performed, were not collected in the database. Blot and colleagues have described and validated an algorithm for use in diagnosing aspergillosis in critically ill individuals [24]. However, the ELSO registry did not collect all the variables needed to apply their definitions. In addition, whether Aspergillus isolated in the lower respiratory tract of critically ill patients can be viewed as a contaminant or colonizer remains a matter of debate [25, 26].",

A prevalence of 3.3% has been reported in patients with a length of stay in the ICU more than 7 days [19]. Moreover, a prevalence of 6.4% of CBSI was found in a retrospective review of ECMO cases in an Australian center [17]. In keeping with these findings, yeast DNA has been detected in 7% of patients on oxygenators [18]. In theory, this should translate to positive fungal cultures at some point.

This confers strong external validity to our study. However, the internal validity of the study is affected by multiple factors partly inherent to its retrospective nature. For instance, microbiological sampling was nonsystematic. This may have caused underestimation of the prevalence of fungal infections. This also weakened the analysis of risk factors by making them highly susceptible to observer bias. Indeed, fungal cultures may have been performed more often in patients with presenting factors that were suspected by clinicians to increase the risk of fungal infection. Moreover, limited data were available on potential confounding factors such as antifungal therapy and prophylaxis. This may have decreased certain associations with risk factors if antifungal therapy was prescribed more often in those patients. Such limitations could be avoided or minimized in a prospective study.",
