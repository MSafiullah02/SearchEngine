Through cross-sectional surveys, interviews, and analysis of malaria indicators between 2011 and 2014, the investigators detailed how the rates of outpatient visits and administered malaria treatments decreased during the Ebola-virus-disease epidemic, with larger decreases in Ebola-affected prefectures, how fewer than expected malaria cases were seen at health facilities in 2014 compared with previous years (an estimated 74 000 cases), and how this is likely to have led to an excess number of malaria deaths, almost certainly greater than the total number of deaths caused by Ebola virus disease in Guinea. Furthermore, and very importantly from a health system perspective, untreated malaria cases have placed an additional burden on an already overburdened health system through a greater number of suspected cases of Ebola virus disease requiring triage and isolation at Ebola transit and treatment centres.",

Health staff interviewed in Gu\u00e9ck\u00e9dou and Kissidougou estimated that less than 25% of patients with malaria, pneumonia, or diarrhoea were seeking care at health centres compared with pre-epidemic values. Outpatient attendance of children younger than 5 years old at Kissidougou district hospital decreased from 200\u2013250 per day before the epidemic to about ten to 12 per day in September, 2014. Information available indicates that monthly revenues at Gu\u00e9ck\u00e9dou district hospital decreased from FGN35 million per month before the epidemic to FGN7 million for August, 2014. Also, immunisation activities slowed down substantially during the Ebola-virus-disease outbreak, while attendance rates at maternal clinics for safe delivery by pregnant women did not decrease.",

This change was certainly the case during the recent epidemic of Ebola virus disease when the marked drop in visits to health centres was at least partly because of the fear among the population about contracting the Ebola virus disease in the health centres and the credibility of the health system was at its lowest. Given that some disruption of the delivery of health services during an epidemic is unavoidable, which measures can reduce the negative effect of the Ebola-virus-disease epidemic on malaria morbidity and mortality?",

            "text": "The WHO Global Malaria Programme proposed measures to reduce the negative effect of the Ebola-virus-disease epidemic on malaria burden and released interim guidelines for malaria prevention and control in Ebola-virus-disease-affected zones in November, 2014.6 These guidelines recommend changes in testing practices, new approaches for long-lasting impregnated nets distribution to avoid overcrowding, and mass drug administration\u2014ie, mass treatment of a large section of the population irrespective of symptoms\u2014with artemisinin-based combination therapies in areas heavily affected by Ebola virus disease, where malaria transmission is high and access to malaria treatment is very low. Benefits of mass drug administration include a rapid reduction in the malaria burden for a certain period, and a decrease in the incidence of febrile illnesses due to malaria. This reduces the presentation of patients who are febrile at Ebola assessment facilities, results in a reduced risk of nosocomial transmission of Ebola virus to patients with malaria, and reduces the workload at those facilities. Mass drug administration with artesunate plus amodiaquine was used for the first time for 400 000 people in the most affected urban area of Monrovia, Liberia, and for more than 2 500 000 people in Freetown and the most affected areas of Sierra Leone. Furthermore, to restore the credibility of health service delivery in the population, it is important that Ebola-virus-disease-specific activities in the communities, such as contract tracing and safe burials, are accompanied by the delivery of standard health services, such as distribution of long-lasting impregnated nets, vaccination, or community case management of child diseases with specific no-touch approaches appropriate to the context of the epidemic.",
