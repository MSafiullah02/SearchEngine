If they acquire the COVID-19 infection I am concerned this medicine will not be available. What should I do?A.Write the prescription for both of my parents to have at home in case we need it. As a physician and a daughter , wife and mother I have a right to protect myself and my family.B.Do not write the prescription as it might contribute to a nationwide shortage for others who require this medication.C.Write a prescription for one of them, not both of them, so that we have at least enough of the medicine to start the treatment if needed.
