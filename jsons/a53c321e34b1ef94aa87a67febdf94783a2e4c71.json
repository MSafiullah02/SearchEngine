Moreover, recently Almeida reported seroconversions to several unidentified faecal antigens with virus morphology in patients with infectious hepatitis (Almeida et al., 1974) . The early reporting of an outbreak of hepatitis A in a rural elementary school in Alabama in October and November 1972 permitted us to obtain acute and convalescent blood samples from 50 sick cluldren and 24 healthy matched controls. Briefly, the children affected were between 6 and 12 years old, and the sharp \"epidemic curve\" suggested a common-source outbreak, one eventually traced to a contaminated water source. A more complete description of the details surrounding the outbreak is given in a companion paper (Baer et al., 1977) . We noted a significant drop in the C'3 and C'4 components of complement in the acute specimens. Selected sera from this same outbreak were tested for possible antibody rises against a variety of viruses and mycoplasma, and the results of that testing are reported here.",

Antibodies to adenovirus types 1 to 33, influenza C, parainfluenza 4A and 4B, Newcastle disease virus (NDV), Coxsackievirus A-24, and coronavirus OC 43 were assayed by the standardized HI test with 0.01 M phosphate-buffered saline diluent and spectrophotometrically standardized 0.4% mammalian or 0.5% avian red blood cells (Hierholzer and Suggs, 1969; Hierholzer et al., 1969) . test as described by Killgore and Dowdle (1970) . Antibodies to herpes simplex 1 and CMV were determined by the IHA procedures of Bernstein and Stewart (1971a, b) , and coronavirus 229 E antibodies were measured by a similar IHA test (Kaye et al., 1972) . Neutrahzing antibodies t o the six Coxsackie B viruses, echovirus types 4 and 9, and Coxsackievirus A-10 were assayed by SN tests in monkey kidney (MK) tissue culture (Hierholzer et al., 1972) . Neutralizing antibody titers to Coxsackievirus A-9, A-16, and A-21 and t o four strains of enterovirus 70 were similarly assayed by SN tests in human diploid fibroblast (RU-1) tissue Hemagglutinating antigens of parainfluenza 4A and 4B were prepared for use in the HI culture, and to Coxsackievirus A-4 in suckling mice brain (Melnick and Wenner, 1969) .

            "text": "The fall in antibody titers to cytomegalovirus and herpesvirus that occurred in some of the hepatitis-A-infected schoolchildren was so dramatic as to demand a plausible explanation. The onset of illness in hepatitis A occurs after the beginning of virus excretion (Dienstag et al., 1975; Ward et al., 1958) . In view of the usual preponderance of active CMV and herpesvirus infections in the young age groups represented here, natural infections probably developed years before this hepatitis A outbreak. It appears, therefore, that the stimulation of the already existing CMV and herpesvirus antibody titers in the affected children occurred a few weeks before the hepatitis symptoms appeared and that these levels were either at their peak or already beginning to fall when our acute samples were drawn. Such an occurrence could account for the titer decreases seen in t h s outbreak of acute hepatitis A in confrast to the titer increases reported in chronic hepatitis (Triger, Kurtz, MacCallum, and Wright, 1972) . diagnosed in the last few years and often involves the liver (Hanshaw et al., 1965) . If temporary liver damage by acute hepatitis A infection stimulates Kupffer cells and liver macrophages, and this causes antibody rises to childhood viruses, CMV would likely be involved. Although the antibody titers to two other primarily childhood viruses, measles and rubella, were reported to be increased in chronic active hepatitis (Triger, Kurtz, MacCallum, and Wright, 1972) no examination for CMV antibody was made in that study; nor are we aware of acute and convalescent sera from acute hepatitis A cases being examined for antibody changes to such a variety of viral antigens as in the present study.",

Walker (1972) has reviewed two mechanisms that might affect antibody production: an increased processing of antigen in the proliferated Kupffer cells, which thus triggers antibody synthesis in immunocytes attracted to the liver (Paronetto et al., 1962; Hadziyannis et al., 1969) ; and, as mentioned earlier, a failure of Kupffer cells to sequester antigens absorbed from the gut. In addition, Popper et al. (1965) has shown that liver injury is associated with activation of the various components of the hepatic mesenchyma and some parts of the lymphoid system, and has suggested that this might explain the frequently encountered erratic false-positive Wasserman tests. The antibody rises to enteric bacteria noted by other workers (Triger, Alp, and Wright, 1972; Bjdrneboe et al., 1972; Protell et al., 1971) during chronic hepatitis also suggest a failure in the sequestering ability of the liver.",
