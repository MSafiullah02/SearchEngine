Surprisingly, we observe through experiments that even in-domain training with standard unsupervised representation learning techniques leads to poor results. We argue that, because of their structured nature, diagram images require more specially-tailored learning objectives. We propose a new method for unsupervised adaptation of out-of-domain feature extractors that asks the model to reason about spatial context. Specifically, we fine-tune a pre-trained image encoder by requiring it to correctly predict the relative orientation between pairs of nearby image regions. Experiments on the recently released Ikea Diagram Dataset show that our proposed method leads to substantial improvements on a downstream search task, more than doubling recall for certain query categories in the dataset.",

A typical goal is to search a collection of engineering diagram images to find diagrams that contain the query part or a similar part as a component in the larger diagram, possibly at a different scales and rotations relative to the query. The matching diagram will likely contain many other parts that are irrelevant to the query, which makes this task different from more standard image search scenarios where matched images will have the query as their central focus. In many ways, the most analogous task is that of matching a keyword query to a full-text document: matched keywords are usually surrounded by irrelevant text.",

[1] recently released a new Ikea dataset, which consists of 13,464 diagrams from Ikea manuals and 16,940 query images, and proposed a neural search engine for performing diagram search. The image features used by Dai et al. [1] are produced by a VGGNET model [16] , pre-trained to predict object classes on ImageNet data [3] . Since ImageNet consists of natural images, rather than data like engineering diagrams, it is reasonable to expect that learning representations for diagrams using in-domain engineering data might lead to better results. Somewhat surprisingly, we show in experiments that tuning image representations using standard unsupervised techniques (e.g. using autoencoding objectives) leads to worse performance than the out-of-domain pretrained model. This is probably a result of structured nature of engineering diagrams that makes them visually distinct from natural images, on which the baseline unsupervised techniques were developed and validated [8] .",

However, we report that such an approach leads to poor results for engineering diagram search.

However, they use pre-trained VGGNET model to extract image features and do not attempt learn or fine tune image feature extractors. Many earlier image retrieval methods are based on SIFT features and bag-of-word models [2, 9, 17] . Recently, convolutional and other neural models have been used more extensively as feature extractors for image retrieval [15, 20] . Use of region based image features has been found useful in some prior image retrieval work [14] . Our proposed method is also related to recent success on learning contextualized word representations [4, 10, 13] and image representations from scratch [5, 11] through self-supervised training by using context prediction as a training signal. Most prior work on fine-tuning and domain adaptation for image representations requires in-domain supervised data, and either uses parameter finetuning [18, 19] or feature selection [7, 19] for domain adaptation. In contrast, our approach is a fully unsupervised method for domain adaptation of pre-trained models. Certain prior works on domain adaptation for image feature extractors require both the source and target domain data during training [19] , which our approach does not require. Some prior works have explored using unsupervised methods like auto-encoders for domain adaptation [12] .",

A classifier with learnable parameters \u03b8 takes as input the extracted features of the two patches and makes a prediction about the relative direction of the patches. Specifically, we consider a two layer feedforward neural network with a softmax function at the end to make a 8-way classification prediction (for 8 cardinal directions).

However, we use the spatial context loss to fine-tune a pre-trained image feature extractor for the target engineering diagrams domain. In contrast, Doersch et al.

The procedure begins with identifying a localized region of high density black pixels, and keeps on expanding it until the black pixel density is lower than a threshold. The Ikea dataset consists of 5 query types: psr, Psr, pSr, psR, PSR: Lowercase letters p, s, r signify that position, scale and rotation, respectively, are unchanged in the generated query relative to the original image from which the query was extracted. Capital letters denote the corresponding altered attribute. Thus, for psr queries set, the identified region is placed onto a white background image of size same as original image, and at same position as the identified region was in the original image. psR queries are constructed by rotating psr queries, pSr queries are constructed by scale transformations, and so on.

We report recall and mean reciprocal rank in downstream search, using the DISHCONV [1], a neural retrieval method which utilizes pairwise training over features extracted from convolutional kernels over image representations. We perform early stopping during training based on recall@1 for queries in the validation split. We consider following baselines: (1) VGG represents a fixed pre-trained VGGNET model, trained on ImageNet data, as used in prior work [1] . (2) VGG-AE finetunes a pre-trained VGGNET using an autoencoder (with a deconvolutional network as decoder) with reconstruction objective. (3) CTXT involves training image representations from scratch just using context prediction [5] . We consider VGGNET architecture (initialized randomly) to encode images, and trained to predict relative direction of pairs of image patches. Table 1 summarizes the results when evaluating downstream search performance. Overall, SPACES performs much better than the baselines VGG, VGG-AE and CTXT across different query types. Recall that psr are the most basic query types, psR are queries created by rotating basic psr queries by varying degrees, and so on. The largest improvement over baselines is observed for pSr and psR query types. SPACES performs better than VGG-AE model probably because it has a more suitable training signal given the structured nature of the engineering diagrams. The baseline CTXT model has to learn the image encoder model entirely from a relatively small number of images. In contrast, SPACES leverages the pre-trained model and is able to fine-tune on the Ikea dataset using only a few thousand images. This demonstrates the utility of SPACES in adapting large pre-trained image encoder models for engineering diagrams. We report MRR for a range scale factor and rotations degrees (Fig. 2) . SPACES performs better than the baseline almost all throughout different scale and rotation changes. We also report the results with SPACES-L which uses total loss on the validation split for early stopping instead of recall@1 scores. MRR and recall scores from these variants are observed to be very similar (Table 1) demonstrating that the proposed approach is robust to such changes in early stopping criteria.",
