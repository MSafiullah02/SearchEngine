Because FMD spreads rapidly and widely and has grave economic consequences 1, it has become one of the animal diseases that livestock owners fear most. The outbreaks of FMD in cattle and swine during 2000 in the United Kingdom have more recently focused worldwide attention on this deadly animal disease 2. As a member of the family Picornavirus, foot\u2010and\u2010mouth disease virus (FMDV) is a non\u2010enveloped, icosahedral virus and the protein capsid encloses a single strand of positive sense RNA. After infection, the viral genome is translated and then cleaved via viral proteases into the mature structural and non\u2010structural proteins 3. The capsid consists of four proteins: VP1, VP2 and VP3 are assembled on the surface of the viral particle and fold as eight\u2010stranded \u03b2\u2010barrels, whereas VP4 is an internal core protein and less structurally conserved 4.",

The VP1 capsid protein has been shown to contain major antigenic determinants. In some instances of protein and peptide vaccines, although the total reactivity of antibodies is high, the level of neutralizing antibodies in comparison is low 9, 10. It was further proposed that the loop of VP1 in the naturally occurring virus could display multiple conformations, and this may elicit a different population of antibodies during immune responses 11, 12.",

Directing the immunogens encoded by the cDNA vectors to undergo the endogenous processing pathway after transgene expression in host cells may lead to an effective cell\u2010mediated (Th1) and humoral (Th2) protective immunity 13, 14. The immune response against FMDV has been shown as T\u2010cell\u2010dependent 15, and therefore the DNA vaccine strategy may also serve as a good strategy to solicit both humoral and cell\u2010mediated immune responses. In animals immunized with inactivated vaccines, a good correlation between neutralizing antibody and protection has been observed 16, and such a correlation has not been well established with animals immunized with non\u2010viral vaccine strategies. These limitations probably have reflected the difficulties of reproducing or mimicking the immunogenicity of an entire viral particle in using simple antigen preparations. Various pieces of evidence suggest that the simpler the epitopic composition of a vaccine, the lower the chances of conferring a solid protection against natural isolates of viruses 17, 18, 19, 20. Therefore, new vaccine strategies may need to employ many or most of the epitopes or in permutations to represent the virus particles.",

One contains a full\u2010length cDNA of the FMDV genome and the other a cDNA construct containing the P1\u20102A and 3C (proteases) encoding regions which have been shown to elicit neutralizing antibody and have partially protected test pigs against viral infection 21, 22, 23. According to these cDNA constructs, it seems that capsid formation in situ is required for effective immunization 22, 23, 24, 25. The immunogens produced by capsid assembly may provide efficacious conformational epitopes 22, 24. Huang et al.\n26 and Wong et al.\n27 designed another approach, where several plasmids encoding various FMDV epitopes and leading signal peptide sequence were employed in the study. Swine inoculated with pCEIS plasmid encoding two major epitopes (site A and C) of FMDV serotype O and a host self immunoglobulin can provide protection against direct FMDV challenge 27.",

In brief, plasmids pIBSY1\u2010VP1, pIBSY1\u2010L\u2010VP1 and pIBSY1\u2010P1 contained the capsid protein VP1 cDNA, a leader sequence of the pseudorabies virus glycoprotein C linked to the VP1 cDNA, and capsid precursor protein P1 (VP1\u20104) cDNA gene of FMDV type O/Taiwan/97, respectively. The VP1 and P1 gene fragments were purified from agarose gel and subcloned into the EcoR I site and BamH I site of the pIBSY1 vector following the standard cloning procedure. The plasmid of pIBSY1\u2010L\u2010VP1 was subcloned from a plasmid containing a leader sequence of the pseudorabies virus glycoprotein C 28 (a generous gift from Dr. Ching\u2010Hua Chang) that was digested with Hind III and EcoR I and blunt\u2010end ligated into the pIBSY1\u2010VP1 vector.

A dose of 1\u20135 ng hAAT cDNA expression vector was shown to produce about 1 ng of transgenic hAAT protein, and this induced readily detectable levels of antibodies against hAAT proteins in gene gun/skin immunized BALB/c mice. These results hence established the efficacy for DNA vaccination using the Helios gene gun.

FMDV replicates in the cytoplasm of host cells and new virus particles are generated in large numbers within the cytosol. With time, the infected cells are destroyed and new virus particles released to infect other cells. In this study on an adult mouse (2\u20133 month old) system, we found that infecting FMDV first appeared in test mouse blood for only a few minutes, and replicated in the blood at 8\u201315 h post\u2010inoculation with 106 TCID50 virus particles via intraperitoneal (IP) injection. However, the virus titer then decreased and was eventually cleared in the serum of test mice after an additional 3\u20135 days. We then found that BALB/c mice first immunized with a commercially available, killed virus vaccine or the current DNA vaccine strategy and then inoculated with highly infectious FMD virus, viremia, cleared the virus in 1\u20132 days, instead of the 3\u20135 days in the control or non\u2010vaccinated mice (Figure 3). As no symptoms were detectable in FMDV\u2010infected mice, this adult mouse challenge model was based on the cytopathic effect (CPE) assay of the clearance of virus particles in serum collected 1\u20136 days post\u2010intraperitoneal injection of the challenging FMDV. Using this protocol, we observed that virus particles were routinely and totally cleared in 1\u20132 days for 100% of test mice vaccinated with commercially obtained killed virus vaccines. In contrast, both the naive and the empty vector\u2010immunized mice routinely (70\u2013100%) still suffered high or medium levels of viremia during the first 1\u20133 days after viral challenge (Figure 3). This result suggested strongly that there was little or no virus replication in the vaccinated mice. This adult mouse system thus provided a convenient and quick assay for the evaluation of molecular DNA vaccine strategies against FMDV (see below).",

More than 200 BALB/c or C57 mice under various experimental conditions have been skin\u2010vaccinated via gene gun in a series of experiments, with a regime of one prime (day 0) and two booster (days 14 and 28) DNA transfections. Test mice were monitored, and pre\u2010immune and post\u2010immune sera collected and analyzed for transgenic VP1 antigen protein expression, and for production of neutralizing antibodies in test mice. We observed that DNA vaccination with plasmid vector expressing VP1 alone routinely induced very low levels of anti\u2010VP1 antibodies and no detectable levels of virus\u2010neutralizing antibody activities in all test mice, providing a very important negative baseline for this study (Tables 1 and 2). Replicate (>6) experiments were performed and up to 60 mice tested for the VP1 results shown in Table 2; similar results were always obtained. In contrast, however, skin DNA vaccination with a cDNA construct expressing the precursor polypeptide of the four FMDV capsid proteins (VP4\u20101), namely P1, induced antibodies against the VP1 protein as well as neutralizing antibodies against the FMDV, and resulted in a significant protective immunity (virus clearance) in test mice (Table 2). Other than gene\u2010gun\u2010mediated in vivo gene transfer, intramuscular injection of DNA followed by in situ electroporation is another physical means for effective gene vaccination in experimental animal systems. Table 3 shows that a very similar result was obtained from the electroporation\u2010mediated DNA immunization method as compared with the gene gun method. Neutralizing antibody titers and virus clearance in test mice were detected after immunization with P1 cDNA plasmids by in vivo electroporation delivery into muscle tissue. Furthermore, these results, obtained from two independent gene delivery methods, were obtained without the use of FMDV viral protease\u2010encoding genes in DNA co\u2010transfection/vaccination, i.e. the 2A or 3ABC protease\u2010expressing cDNA genes of FMDV were not included for transgene expression in the current vaccinating\u2010DNA vector construct. In one P1 cDNA immunized mouse in this experiment, the anti\u2010VP1 antibody ELISA titers and the anti\u2010viral neutralizing antibody titers were found to be as high as 26 500 and 256, respectively. In the mouse challenge experiment, 80\u2013100% mice immunized with this P1 cDNA expression plasmid were found to be effectively and quickly cleared of the infecting FMDV particles, whereas control animals could not clear virus rapidly (Tables 2 and 3).",

The reason we designed the DNA vaccine vector without incorporating the protease\u2010encoding genes was based on safety considerations, because an exact processing of the viral capsid proteins can create authentic viral capsids by processing with specific viral proteases, and we envision this in turn might generate novel recombinant virus in the host with other types of virus, e.g. at the virus assembly level.

In the present study, the 2\u20133 day shorter period for viral clearance has proved as experimentally distinguishable and useful in our assays of not just DNA vaccines, but also in studies of peptide vaccines against FMDV, as we previously reported 26. These results show that this assay is sensitive enough for a spectrum of studies on vaccine efficacy. It would be interesting to investigate in future studies whether various anti\u2010FMDV vaccines or vaccines at different vaccination dosages that confer a substantial difference in viral clearance activities or vaccine efficacy in pigs could also be effectively distinguished from each other within very specific time points of this 2\u20133 day period of our current mouse model. So far, we have not accumulated enough data to evaluate this possibility.

Previous studies have shown that the whole virus particle or an \u2018authentic\u2019 empty capsid assembly was very important for induction of neutralizing antibodies and protection against viral challenge 21, 22, 23. In comparison, our current result on the efficacy of P1 DNA vaccine but the lack of it for the VP1 DNA vaccine may be explained by the following possibilities. Firstly, the transgenic VP1 protein produced in mouse epidermal cells cannot serve as an effective immunogen in our study, yet, in contrast, the VP1 and/or P1 protein moiety(s) from the multiple subunit polyprotein of VP\u20104, \u20102, \u20103 and \u20101 (as a single chain transgenic P1 protein) can however serve as a potent immunogen, presumably by presenting as a different protein folding as the \u2018free or single unit\u2019 VP1 transgenic protein. Secondly, the transgenic P1 protein, consisting all of the FMD protein components of the virus capsid, may be able to form some kind of modified capsid\u2010like structural assemblies or protein aggregates in test mouse skin cells, effecting as a strong viral immunogen. A third possibility is that endogenous protease (e.g. chymotrypsin) activities of mouse host cells may process the P1 transgenic protein into efficacious configurations or conformations, resulting in production of VP1, P1 or other viral proteins with novel (non\u2010authentic) foldings, and these can serve as potent viral protein epitopes. Western blot analyses (Figure 2) showed that the P1 precursor polypeptide can be transiently expressed between low (for Exp.\u20101) to readily (for Exp.\u20102) detectable levels. In Exp.\u20102, different animals from Exp.\u20101 were used, and we observed an increased abundance of P1 protein. For both experiments, correct size and transgenic VP1 protein, derived by \u2018host cell\u2019 processing, were clearly detected at high levels in test pig skin tissues that were gene\u2010gun\u2010transfected with the P1 cDNA expression constructs. These results suggest that authentic and intact transgenic P1 and VP1 viral proteins were produced in immunized animals. Xing et al.\n39 have studied the interactive, multiple domains of the FMDV for involvement of VP3, \u20102 and \u20101 proteins on the topical structure of FMDV. Their findings and our collaboration with them in this study led us to suggest that capsid\u2010like protein aggregates or \u2018virus\u2010like particles\u2019 (VLP) from transgenic P1 products may exist transiently or at relatively low frequency. Future studies using scanning electron microscopy and protein biochemistry techniques will be required to discern the actual molecular mechanism.",

            "text": "The immunogenicity of capsid protein VP1 has been shown to be conferred mostly from the G\u2010H loop of VP1 40, 41. In comparison with our previous work on the immune response obtained from the E. coli\u2010produced, recombinant capsid protein VP1 29, we have observed in this study that the DNA vaccines encoding VP1 or P1 protein were much (10\u2013100\u2010fold) less immunogenic than an equivalent dose of the VP1 antigen preparation administered in the form of recombinant protein in mice. Throughout multiple independent experiments, using both gene\u2010gun\u2010 and electroporation\u2010mediated DNA vaccinations with a plasmid vector expressing only the VP1 cDNA, no detectable effect on the production of anti\u2010viral neutralizing antibodies and virus clearance in a total of 60 VP1 tested mice has been seen (Tables 2 and 3). The lack of any immune response to the VP1 cDNA vaccine, as compared to the P1 cDNA vaccine, may due to a number of reasons: first, the lack of appropriate folding of transgenic VP1 in test mouse skin tissue or tibialis anterior (TA) muscle; second, antigen presentation of the VP1 protein is not favored in test skin or muscle tissues; third, a very short half\u2010life or inappropriate transgenic protein processing of the expressed VP1 antigen in test host cells; and fourth, the immune response of the Th2 pathway in skin tissue or TA muscles may be too low to result in a threshold activity. Future studies will be needed to investigate these possibilities.",

By expressing only a four FMDV capsid protein sequence as a single polypeptide molecule (P1) from a cDNA vector via skin or muscle DNA vaccination, we could elicit a significant immune response (i.e. neutralizing antibody) against FMDV, providing protection against viral challenge in an adult BALB/c mouse system. The current experimental system creates the potential for future studies on a complete set of viral capsid proteins as precursor molecules for DNA vaccination. This and related molecular strategies for developing future FMDV or other virus DNA vaccines, and for research into molecular mechanisms of the target virus (e.g. host cell processing and assembling of P1 protein components without viral proteases), could be investigated using the current gene delivery/mouse evaluation system.",
