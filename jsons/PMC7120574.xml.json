Generally, the higher the bed occupancy level, the greater the microbial bioburden in the air (Beggs 2003). Humans spread infectious particles of respiratory secretions by coughing, sneezing, or talking. On average, a cough can generate some 3,000 droplet nuclei, and the same can do speaking for 5 min; sneeze can generate as many as 40,000 droplet nuclei. Droplet nuclei are large particles that settle out from the air, but once evaporated into particles in the 0.5\u201312 \u03bcm range (Cole and Cook 1998), they can be resuspended in the indoor air. Other aerosol-generating activities are represented by making a bed: In that case, skin scales shed by patients infected with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus represent a reservoir for airborne infections (Ulrich et al. 2008).",

            "text": "As far as the environmental origin of airborne pathogens, a problem until now underestimated is the \u201cmicrobial ecology\u201d of hospital building. Actually, their potential effects on human health can be minimized through proper design, construction, operation, maintenance, and cleaning. In particular, the extent and persistence of moisture in various structural, finishing, and furnishing materials is a problem of greatest importance (Cole and Cook 1998; D\u2019Alessandro and Capolongo 2009). If relative humidity is uncontrolled or if leaks, floods, or sewage backups are not readily and properly repaired, the result is an altered microbial ecology that permits the amplification (overgrowth) and dissemination of fungal and bacterial species with the potential for opportunistic nosocomial infections (Cole and Cook 1998; Vonberg and Gastmeier 2006). Microorganisms grow in moisture films on several surfaces and within porous materials. The amount of free water available to them for growth on a substrate or microenvironment (e.g., ceiling tile) is described as water activity (aw), the ratio of the vapor pressure of water in the substrate to the vapor pressure of free water. Increased aw due to high relative humidity, leaks, or floods, if allowed to persist more than 24 h, changes the normal ecology of a microenvironment or of the entire building, with microbial competition resulting in the predominance of one or more organisms with potentially damaging effects upon materials and health. Fungi require the lowest aw level to grow. Most fungi have a minimum requirement of aw of at least 0.88%, but some fungi have even lower limits, down to 0.66\u20130.70% (Cole and Cook 1998; D\u2019Alessandro et al. 2016).",

Droplet nuclei, particles arising from drying of suspended droplets, have been associated with airborne transmission and defined as \u22645 \u03bcm in size (Seigel et al. 2007). These values arose from a study (Wells 1955) regarding pulmonary tuberculosis transmission, which is not exactly applicable to other organisms; at that time, sampling methods were unable to measure particles suspended in air around the infectious source. Observations of particle dynamics have demonstrated that a range of droplet sizes, including those with diameters of 30 \u03bcm or greater, can remain suspended in the air (Cole and Cook 1998). In general, whereas fine airborne particles containing pathogens that are able to remain infective may transmit infections over long distances, organisms transmitted by the droplet route do not remain infective over long distances and therefore do not require special air handling and ventilation (Seigel et al. 2007).",

Overall, this route of transmission accounts for 10\u201320% of endemic HCAIs (Beggs 2003). Microorganisms carried in this manner may be dispersed over long distances by air currents and may be inhaled by susceptible individuals who have not had face-to-face contact with (or been in the same room with) the infectious individual (Seigel et al. 2007). The prevention of the spread of airborne transmitted pathogens (e.g., Mycobacterium tuberculosis, measles (rubeola) virus, and varicella zoster virus) requires the use of special air-handling and ventilation systems to contain and then safely remove the infectious agent and also a specific respiratory protection.",

In the case of gastrointestinal viral infections, it is hypothesized that the aerosolized particles from vomitus or fecal material are inhaled and subsequently swallowed (Seigel et al. 2007). Such transmission has occurred over distances longer than 3 feet but within a defined airspace (e.g., patient room), suggesting that it is unlikely that these agents remain viable on air currents that travel long distances.

An aerosol is a collection of solid or liquid particles suspended in a gas, such as air, that may contain particles of any size. The fate of an aerosol in the environment is governed by physical processes (gravitational force, air movement, etc.). In the context of infectious disease transmission, many processes and procedures generate aerosols that may contain both body fluid particles and pathogens. Infectious aerosols are subject to the same transport processes of other aerosols. The range of particle sizes included depends on several factors such as the mechanism of aerosol generation, the viscosity of the aerosolized fluid, and its liquid content. The liquid content influences the extent to which the particle size reduces with evaporation. From the authors\u2019 perspective, the concept of aerosol transmission is of primary importance to occupational health and it should trigger consideration for controls, such as respiratory protection, that limit workers\u2019 exposures when in the proximity of infectious patients, regardless of evidence for airborne transmission (Jones and Brosseau 2015).",

One popular variant uses a rebreathed fraction, the fraction of inhaled air that has been exhaled previously by someone in the building (Nardell 2016).

HVAC systems are the primary mechanism for controlling air in the hospital environment; their goals are to replace potentially contaminated air with clean air, to minimize the mixing of dirty and clean air, and to regulate ambient temperature and humidity. In addition, filtration of ventilated air can reduce the number of airborne pathogens. Air filters are rated based on the size of particles they are able to remove, and high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filters are widely used in healthcare settings, having an efficiency of at least 99.97% at a test aerosol diameter of 0.3 \u00b5m (Sehulster and Chinn 2003). HEPA filters remove airborne pathogens in critical areas such as operating rooms, transplant units, isolation rooms, and intensive care units. Filtration is a strategy that utilizes several levels of filters, the highest of which is HEPA filter. The use of HEPA filters is widespread in hospitals, especially in areas that house immunocompromised patients. Another issue related to HVAC systems is the appropriate type of airflow direction to recommend for protective environment. Multiple technologies are currently available to control the direction of airflow inside the hospital, although no consensus exists whether turbulent, displacement, or unidirectional airflow is the most effective (Jacob et al. 2013). Traditional ventilation systems in patient care areas utilize turbulent air to direct airflow rapidly away from patients. also called unidirectional airflow), used most commonly in operating room, is a method of air ventilation in which ultraclean air that has passed through a HEPA filter is distributed either vertically or horizontally in a smooth stream directed over the patient. Although unidirectional airflows seem to be the gold standard, the evidence supporting their use in operating rooms and other protective environments is not enough, because their impact on infection rates remains unresolved (Jacob et al. 2013; Agodi et al. 2015); therefore, further investigations are required.",
