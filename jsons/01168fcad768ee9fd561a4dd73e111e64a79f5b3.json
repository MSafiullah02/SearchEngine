In general, fractals are applied to objects in space and processes in time that can be characterized by properties of self-similarity, scaling, and fractal statistics [1] [2] [3] . Self-similarity means that smaller subunits of the fractals resemble the larger units, so fractals lack a single length (time) scale, and their structure (shape) is organized on multiple scales of length (time). The biological examples of spatial fractals are airways in the lung, vessels in the circulatory system, ducts in the liver, while temporal fractals are heartbeats, volumes of breaths, timing of the opening, and closing of ion channels.",

            "text": "The scaling property states that the values measured depend on the resolution used to make the measurement. Scaling relationships for correlations between measurements are often a power law that is a straight line on a logarithmic-logarithmic plot. For example, the quarterpower allometric scaling laws over different organisms are presented in nearly all biological rates and dimensions, including metabolic rate, lifespan, heart rate, DNA nucleotide substitution rate, length of aortas, cerebral gray matter [4] . Similarly, the statistics property states that the average or variance of a fractal object or process depends on the resolution used to make the measurement. As more data is included, the averages will continue to decrease or increase, so the real average does not exist. A number of different statistical properties have been measured to analyze fractal systems, which changes upon the resolution used to measure, including mean, variance, standard deviation, Fano factor, and rescaled range. Statistical properties of fractals are present in the timing of the action potentials in hearing nerve cells, in the spatial distribution of blood flow in the muscle of the heart, in the timing of the electrical activity of the heartbeat, or in the changing of electrical voltage across the cell membrane of white blood cells [2, 3] . These studies show that fluctuations occur at all time scales, scale-invariant, and the time series exhibit long-range power-law correlations. This fractal notion was applied to interbeat interval fluctuations to distinguish certain disease states of the heart from the healthy states [5] [6] [7] . It is noteworthy that time series of the heart rate fluctuations for different heart conditions show nearly identical means and variances, suggesting no clinically relevant difference [5] . However, it was shown by using the method of detrended fluctuation analysis (DFA) that under normal conditions, beat-to-beat fluctuations in heart rate display long-range correlations typically exhibited by dynamical systems far from equilibrium, while heart rate time series from patients with severe congestive failure show a breakdown of such long-range correlation [7] .",

It is extremely interesting that he used deviations, but not average values for pulse fluctuations and had a phenomenal counter ability in it [19, 20] . At the present, a deep understanding of how the study of the fractality in a system proceeds, has been achieved; at first, fractal parameters are calculated, and then the question of why the fractal dimension takes those values is answered.

By considering the infecting process irreversible and taking into account the recovering process, we can expect correlations in the growth of new cases. We will study correlation effects in spreading of COVID-19 in USA by analyzing the time series of the daily growth of new cases before and after the \"stay-at-home\" order and in states with different population density.",

Note, that the data is constantly changing, and we used the data taken as of the end of April. To quantify these considerations, we used a rescaled (R/S) method, allowing to calculate the Hurst parameter. The Hurst parameter is a useful statistical quantity for characterizing the long-term memory of time series. It quantifies the tendency of the time series to regress strongly to the mean or to cluster in a direction. Its value in the range 0.5 -1 indicates a time series with long-term positive autocorrelation, meaning that a high value in the series will probably be followed by another high value, and that the values a long time into the future will also tend to be high. A value in the range 0-0.5 indicates a time series with long-term switching between high and low values in adjacent pairs, meaning the tendency to switch between high and low values will last a long time into the future. A value of 0.5 indicates a completely uncorrelated series.",

It was shown that the Hurst parameter is a good indicator of decreasing the correlations in the spread of the disease due to the order. In all states with \"stay-at-home\" order, the parameter changes its value from persistency to antipersistency. The closer the value to zero, the stronger is the tendency for the fluctuations to revert to its long-term means value. The population density seems to be another crucial factor for spreading the disease due to the higher probability of the contingency of the people. In general, the dependence of the Hurst parameter on different controlling parameters such as \"stay-athome\" order or the population density can be described in the framework of catastrophe theory [25] .",

However, after the order the Hurst parameter sharply decreases, except the District of Columbia. This change takes place mostly due to the restrictions of transportation of people, thus localizing them at home which corresponds to the small (almost zero) diffusion coefficient (see Eqn. 1). We can also compare the Hurst parameters of different states as a function of the population density. Due to the highest population density in District of Columbia and New York city, their Hurst parameters before the order are higher than that of other states showing high correlations in the observations. As we noted above, the values of Hurst parameter are not very accurate because of the small number of data (<50) available so far. One more factor which could be responsible for inaccuracy of the results is the fact that it is not well known how many people in states have been infected to date since most people with Covid-19 experience mild illness or without any symptoms. These values can be improved in our further work as more data on new cases of Covid-19 become available.",
