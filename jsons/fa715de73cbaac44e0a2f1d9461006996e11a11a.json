We have constructed a model for the spread of the virus that reproduces this phenomenon via inclusion of two (or more) categories of susceptibility to the virus. In the simplest case, the population is given a smaller fraction of 10-20% with higher susceptibility and the balance of 80-90% with lower susceptibility. Susceptibility is taken to include the level of immunity to the virus combined with the societal circumstances of certain smaller groups within a population. This is programmed numerically by considering a realistic random rate of contacts, together with an assumed constant viral genome. The remaining major variable is the societal response of nations to the outbreak, with earlier or later application of various degrees of lockdown, tracing and sanitation. China, South Korea and other nations, including Germany, have stopped or greatly slowed the spread of the disease before it could run its course through a whole population. Using this model the extent of progress toward herd immunity is discussed, with an in-principle estimate of the remaining toll to be experienced.",

            "text": "The last thing the first author expected was to be applying his experience in modeling atomic and molecular processes in gas lasers to a sudden affliction that has within 100 days affected all of humanity. In these lasers there is usually a very large number of different states that can interact in different ways -complexity is the rule. The statistics of light emitted by lasers depends upon an initial growth from a single photon into a very powerful beam, an example of the process of exponential growth, which has become too familiar to us in the course of this disease. The puzzle that gave rise to the present calculation gradually developed over the most recent 20 days (up to 12 th May, 2020) during which the fractional death for many nations [4] , plotted systematically by the second author, in Figure 1 , converged on 0.05%. This could not be explained easily, because the mortality in diagnosed cases was in some nations very high: from 5 to 15%. If the disease was working its way through a uniform population of people identically susceptible to the disease, and propagation of the disease had not been suppressed via a change in behavior, then different countries would be exhibiting vastly different fractional mortality. This is because the time for cases to multiply by 2.7 times (one E-fold, discussed below) was measured from the traces in Figure 1 to be only 3.1 \u00b1 0.5 days, which is much shorter than the spacing of different nations' growth curves by 20 days at the same fractional point. There ought to have been orders of magnitude different fractional deaths at a given time, and many nations ought by now to have exceeded the observed 0.05% in Figure 1 . On the other hand, had nations taken action to reduce gathering size and improve hygiene, then the differences between national approaches would again have stood out much more starkly than the constant result of Figure 1 . The fact that several nations stand out by having much lower mortality, indicating effective mitigation, does not explain the constancy of mortality in the higher group. A secondary interest followed here is the statistics that could have led to the spacing by a mere 20 days of the mortality curves (measured at the same point) across many nations. To look at this properly we need to have either direct knowledge of the earliest cases outside of China (of which several are known) or as in the present approach a \"Monte-Carlo\" (dice-throwing) estimate of the size and frequency of gatherings combined with a known transmission probability for passing the infection from one who has a high titer of virus, to a non-infected contact at a gathering. In relation to gatherings, we have estimated that the number of days that one contacts a given number PMAX of people is inversely proportional to PMAX.

It is standard practice in epidemiology to consider multiple levels of susceptibility to a pathogen. The simplest variation from a single level is two levels, the starting point of this analysis. Our two-state model makes the following assumptions: 1. There are at least two levels of susceptibiliity to attack by Covid-19. There will in reality be a full spectrum of response, but only two levels are needed to illustrate the effects of this internal variation. There may be many different reasons for this variation, further touched upon below. 2. The higher susceptibility is associated with a small fraction of the population. 3. The lower susceptibility is associated with the larger balance of the population. 4. The virus is constant in its genome.",

The two levels of susceptibility are associated with effectively two probabilities (PINF) of transmission from an infected person to a person who has not previously been exposed. It is assumed that each of these levels is a constant per encounter, across all nations, at all times. (This constant, in a homogeneous population of single susceptibility, would be approximately 0.03, or 3%, to match the growth rate of the disease). 6. The course of the disease is assumed to be the same globally. This is taken here to be : a) 5 days incubation after the initial infection b) A 15 day course with symptoms, possibly slight, during which virus shedding reduces at the rate of 15% per day [6] , a reduction factor of 0.85 c) Either recovery, or death after 15 days with a fixed probability. The overall proportion of deaths in relation to cases is therefore taken as 0.85 to the power of 15 (= 0.087), which is the residual sick population after 15 days, times the probability of death (PMD) at day 15. 7. Once the patient has recovered, it is assumed that there will not be a recurrence, i.e. that person has entered what we denote in the program as IMPOP, the totally immune population. 8. Within a nation, in the low susceptibility subgroup there is an overall homogeneous level of contacts, ignoring the differences between city and countryside. This is probably the weakest assumption. It would be simple, if the gathering statistics were known for every locality, to make a larger model that adds all of them, and includes cross transfer via travel between them. Small sub-groups such as people on board ship, or essential transit system workers, have prolonged high contact rates that break the statistical trend for the overall population and put them in the higher susceptibility subgroup, even though their immune systems may be strong. 9. Within a nation there is a period of life as normal, in terms of contact rates and hygiene, during which the disease takes hold and enters exponential growth, followed by the realization that action has to be taken, and principally in that nation the size of gatherings is then dramatically curtailed (the process of \"lockdown\"). 10 . In the sociology of nations, if one nation believes it is headed for the highest mortality it could be motivated to apply even more strict isolation so as not to be embarrassed by that honor.",

Above 1,000 an average contact number is assigned to the whole cohort to calculate the infections it creates.

This E-fold number was derived from the slopes between 10 -5 and 10 -3 % mortality that were straight lines on the logarithmic plot of Figure 1 . Countries such as China and S. Korea did not have a clear slope over two decades, due to rapid mitigation, hence their early growth rates, although comparably high, could not be well-established.
