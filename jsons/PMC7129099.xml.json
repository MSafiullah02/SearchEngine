Therefore, few online mental health services were provided for those in need.4 The popularisation of internet services and smartphones, and the emergence of fifth generation (5G) mobile networks, have enabled mental health professionals and health authorities to provide online mental health services during the COVID-19 outbreak. Fast transmission of the virus between people hinders traditional face-to-face psychological interventions. By contrast, provision of online mental health services is safe. To date, several types of online mental health services have been implemented widely for those in need during the outbreak in China.",

One such multicentre survey involving 1563 medical staff, with our centre at Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University (Guangzhou, China) as one of the study sites, found the prevalence of depression (defined as a total score of \u22655 in the Patient Health Questionnaire-9) to be 50\u00b77%, of anxiety (defined as a total score of \u22655 in the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7) to be 44\u00b77%, of insomnia to be 36\u00b71% (defined as a total score of \u22658 in the Insomnia Severity Index), and of stress-related symptoms (defined as a total score of \u22659 in the Impact of Events Scale-Revised) to be 73\u00b74%. These findings are important in enabling health authorities to allocate health resources and develop appropriate treatments for medical staff who have mental health problems.",

As of February 8, 29 books associated with COVID-19 have been published, 11 (37\u00b79%) of which are on mental health, including the \u201cGuidelines for public psychological self-help and counselling of 2019-nCoV pneumonia\u201d, published by the Chinese Association for Mental Health.",

Online psychological self-help intervention systems, including online cognitive behavioural therapy for depression, anxiety, and insomnia (eg, on WeChat), have also been developed. In addition, several artificial intelligence (AI) programmes have been put in use as interventions for psychological crises during the epidemic. For example, individuals at risk of suicide can be recognised by the AI programme Tree Holes Rescue,5 by monitoring and analysing messages posted on Weibo, and alerting designated volunteers to act accordingly.",
