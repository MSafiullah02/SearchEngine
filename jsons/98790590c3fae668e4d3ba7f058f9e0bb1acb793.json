            "text": "As I sit writing this editorial only 2 weeks into the New Year, I can report that I have already suffered two upper respiratory tract viral infections or 'common colds'. The first was a particularly nasty affair with symptoms representing almost a full house of those commonly recognized in this syndrome. Namely, sore throat, tracheitis, severe cough, to be followed swiftly by a runny nose and severe nasal blockage which inevitably lead to sinusitis associated with severe headache. The final insult was the development of a severe and highly productive bronchitis! As if this were not enough, just as I was beginning to recover a second virus assaulted me and turned my nose into a swiftly running tap for 36 h, though thankfully this virus was considerate enough to leave it at that. It is possible that these were a punishment for over-indulgence in the revelries associated with the holiday season, but it is also possible that they were sent as a timely reminder that I should get on with this editorial which I had been 'thinking about' but not actually doing, for a few weeks! They also served to remind me that the search for the cure of the common cold or indeed a reasonably effective treatment thereof has been a focus of intensive research for 40-50 yr, so far without very encouraging results. A further study is reported in the pages of this journal showing that an established asthma treatment is also effective in the treatment of the common cold [1] , I will consider the implications of these findings later in this article, but first 1 will consider the epidemiology and mechanisms of the common cold and briefly review previous studies [I],",

            "text": "The common cold is probably the most frequent illness afilicting mankind, and is certainly the number one cause of consultations with primary care medical practitioners. It is also associated with a great deal of industrial and school absenteeism. Based on current estimates, adults are thought to have an average of five illnesses per annum, with school age children following at around 8-12, and infants probably suffering even more frequent afilictions. There are numerous factors infiuencing the epidemiology of viral upper respiratory tract infections, including individual and community immunity, seasonal variation, socioeconomic factors such as nutrition and population density, and perhaps most important of aii, family structure. It is well known that pre-school and school age children are the most frequent introducers of new viruses into families. The influence of socioeconomic \u00a9 1996 Blackwell Science Ltd factors is highlighted by a study in Brazil where almost continuous infection was detected in a densely-crowded, urban, economically-deprived setting. The epidemiology of viral respiratory tract infections has been considered in much more detail elsewhere [2] , It is thought that there are well over 200 individual viruses or atypical bacteria associated with the common cold, but these can be grouped into eight or nine virus types, Rhinoviruses, of which there are over 100 serotypes are the most common cause of the common cold, accounting for 50-60%. The next most common are coronaviruses, of which there are two main serotypes infecting humans; they are thought to cause around 15% of common colds. Respiratory syncytial (RS) virus, influenza viruses A, B and C, and parainfluenza viruses 1-4 are the next most common, but their incidence is very much dependent on factors such as age and immunity. Other viruses associated with the common cold include adenoviruses and enteroviruses and both Mycoplasina and Chlatvydia pneutnotvcte have also been associated.",

There are too many such studies to mention them individually here, but sufiice it to say that no effective drug has emerged so far because of a combination of factors, including drug toxieity and the very rapid emergence of resistant viruses resulting from the rapid mutation rate that viruses are known to possess. More recently, following the identification of several cell surface proteins that act as virus receptors and are involved in virus entry into the cell, efforts have been targeted at blocking virus receptor binding. One particular focus of attention has been rhinovirus and its binding to ICAM-1 which is the receptor for 90% of rhinoviruses. This has been reviewed recently [29] , and trials with monoclonal antibodies and with soluble ICAM-1 have been encouraging both in vitro and in animal studies. It is too soon to say yet whether these drugs will be effective, and whether they will be amenable to large scale production and have sufficiently long residence times in the nasal cavity to be clinically useful. Another note of caution is on the emergence of resistant strains. It had been thought that any mutations producing resistance would result in nonviability, as receptor binding is an essential step to virus replication. However, there is an initial report of emergence of a strain of polio virus, resistant to neutralization by soluble receptor [30] ,",

There are many precedents of successful vaccination programmes, including smallpox and polio. Vaccine programmes for respiratory viruses have been much less successful, however, Infiuenza vaccine is relatively effective despite the marked antigenic shift and drift, though at the cost of great expense, resulting from the intensive vigilance needed to keep up with the viruses' effort at evasion, RS virus has been the next target for vaccine production but received a major setback when formalin inactivated vaccines were found to be associated with eosinophilic pneumonitis and increased morbidity and mortality on subsequent natural exposure to the virus. These adverse results have set back RS virus vaccine development by at least 20 yr and have meant that current efforts need to proceed with extreme caution. Considerable research has been undertaken to determine why such adverse effects resulted from this vaccine and present thoughts suggest that different RS virus surface proteins are capable of inducing very different cellular immune responses. The F protein and 22FC produce a Th-1 type and cytotoxic response, while the G protein favours a Th-2 type response [31] , Clinical studies with F subunit vaccines are now underway and it is hoped that an effective vaccine may not be too far in coming. There are also initial trials with parainfiuenza type 3 vaccines, but the other respiratory viruses have commanded relatively little attention. Rhinovirus in particular has been a very difficult target for vaccine design, as there are well over 100 different serotypes, which are serotype specific in their induction of neutralizing antibody responses. Recent work, however, has suggested that T cell responses are relatively conserved across serotypes and this may be a fruitful area for future research,",

One of the major barriers to development of an effective treatment is that viral replication seems to be at its peak just prior to or on the day of the first occurrence of symptoms. There is therefore a very small window of opportunity for introducing an effective treatment. The fact that the authors of the present study [1] were able to demonstrate an effect after symptoms had begun is very encouraging and suggests that further research into this class of compounds is indicated. The possible mechanisms of action are intriguing and though there is a good deal of information available on the mechanisms of action of cromolyns in asthma, there is very little information on the effect of these compounds in virus infection. One report suggests an effect on cytopathic effect at very high concentrations, but no direct effect on viral replication [48] , and these findings were confirmed in a subsequent study [49] .",
