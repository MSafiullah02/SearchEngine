The passive movement of water is decreased and airway secretions are dehydrated with very low surface liquid layer. Cilia become compressed inhibiting ciliary clearance and cough clearance, bacteria thrive; immune function is also abnormal at the airway surface.

Overnight saturation monitoring can be very helpful to recognize issues that require additional support.\n",
