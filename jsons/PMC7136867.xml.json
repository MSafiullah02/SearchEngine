The family includes two subfamilies: Letovirinae and Orthocoronavirinae. Orthocoronavirinae includes the genera Alphacoronvirus, Betacoronavirus, Gammacoronavirus, and Deltacoronavirus. Alphacoronaviruses and betacoronaviruses typically infect only mammals, whereas gammacoronoviruses and deltacoronaviruses typically infect avian species and sometimes mammals (Cui et al., 2019). Coronaviruses are common human pathogens; two types of alphacoronaviruses (229E and NL63) and two types of betacoronaviruses (OC43 and HKU1) circulate in humans and cause common cold. More pathogenic coronaviruses for humans include SARS-CoV-1, the Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and now SARS-CoV-2, which are all betacoronaviruses.",

            "text": "Coronaviruses have a large (30+ kb) single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome encoding for several open reading frames. One frame encodes the spike protein (S protein), a class I fusion protein that mediates attachment of the virus to cell surface receptors followed by uptake into endosomes (for most coronaviruses). Proteolytic cleavage of the S protein and fusion of viral and endosomal membranes trigger release of viral RNA into the cytosol (reviewed in Fehr and Perlman, 2015). The RNA contains a 5\u2032 cap structure and a 3\u2032 poly(A) tail that allows expression of the replicase, which is encoded by approximately two-thirds of the genome. The other third codes for the structural and accessory proteins. The replicase is expressed as two polyproteins: pp1a and pp1ab; these include up to 16 nonstructural proteins (nsps). The nsps are generated by processing of pp1a and pp1ab by 2\u20133 viral proteases encoded within the replicase. Many nsps then assemble into the replicase-transcriptase complex that\u2014in the host cell cytosol\u2014produces anti-sense genome, new viral genome, and subgenomic RNA that serves as mRNA. Structural proteins S, matrix (M) protein, and envelope (E) are then generated and inserted into the endoplasmatic reticulum and follow the secretory pathway to the endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC). A minority of coronaviruses also encode a hemagglutinin esterase (HE). In many coronaviruses, the S protein is cleaved into two subunits, S1 and S2, often by furin-like proteases. The RNA genome associates with nucleoprotein and then buds into the ERGIC, forming virus particles. After assembly, virions are transported to the cell surface in vesicles and are exocytosed. Several accessory proteins, which seem to be important for pathogenesis, are also expressed but not all are functionally characterized.",

            "text": "Clinical trials with the nucleotide analog remdesivir (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04257656, NCT04252664, NCT04280705, etc.) and protease inhibitors (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04255017, NCT04276688, etc.), as well as other treatment options, are ongoing in China and the United States, and trial results are expected within weeks. Remdesivir works against coronaviruses closely related to SARS-CoV-2 in animal models, as well as against the related MERS-CoV, including in NHPs (Agostini et al., 2018, Brown et al., 2019, de Wit et al., 2020, Sheahan et al., 2017, Sheahan et al., 2020). Remdesivir was also tested for treatment of ebolavirus infections in humans (and found to be less successful than other treatments by Mulangu et al., 2019); therefore, safety data exist for this therapeutic agent, which should accelerate the process of clinical testing against SARS-CoV-2. Remdesivir\u2019s mechanism of action as a nucleotide analog is not clear, but it likely terminates RNA synthesis, leads to incorporation mutagenesis, or both (Agostini et al., 2018). In addition, a combination of the two licensed HIV inhibitors, lopinavir and ritonavir, is also being tested in clinical trials (e.g., ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04264858, etc.). Lopinavir is a bona fide protease inhibitor, whereas ritonavir was initially designed as protease inhibitor but was found to boost the half-life of lopinavir by inhibiting cytochrome P450 (Hull and Montaner, 2011). The combination was compassionately used as treatment for SARS-CoV-1 in 2003\u20132004 and showed some promise (Chu et al., 2004). Effectiveness of the combination was limited in mice but appreciable in NHP models of MERS-CoV (Chan et al., 2015, Sheahan et al., 2020). The mechanism of action of lopinavir is not clear, but it likely inhibits one or more coronavirus proteases. Other treatment options with ongoing or planned clinical trials include dosing recombinant human ACE2 to neutralize the virus and prevent lung damage (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04287686) and using the antiviral arbidol, a fusion inhibitor (Kadam and Wilson, 2017, Teissier et al., 2011). Another interesting option is the use of convalescent serum as treatment; clinical trials to test this are ongoing in China (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04264858, placebo control, not recruiting yet), and compassionate use of this strategy has recently started in the US (e.g. at Mount Sinai Medical Center, NY). Similarly, polyclonal human immunoglobulin G (IgG) derived from transgenic cows could be used, because this strategy has been successful for MERS-CoV in animal models (Luke et al., 2016) and has been tested for safety in clinical trials (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT02788188). Many of these trials will have results within months, and if remdesivir (produced by Gilead) and/or lopinavir plus ritonavir (produced by AbbVie as Kaletra and Aluvia, respectively) show effectiveness, they could potentially be used widely within a short time frame. Compassionate use of these drugs has already been reported for SARS-CoV-2 infections (Holshue et al., 2020, Lim et al., 2020).",

This was basically just a change of strains and established and approved processes, established release criteria, and existing correlates of protection could be used (Krammer and Palese, 2015). Still, it took six months until the vaccine was ready to be distributed and used, and it came too late to affect the second pandemic wave, which took place in the United States in fall 2009. This time, we are facing a new challenge in the form of a virus that has just emerged in humans, and the response will be more complex because there are no existing vaccines or production processes for coronavirus vaccines.",

SARS-CoV-2 was identified in record time, and its genomic sequence was swiftly made widely available by Chinese researchers (Wu et al., 2020, Zhou et al., 2020, Zhu et al., 2020). In addition, we know from studies on SARS-CoV-1 and the related MERS-CoV vaccines that the S protein on the surface of the virus is an ideal target for a vaccine. In SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-CoV-2, this protein interacts with the receptor ACE2, and antibodies targeting the spike can interfere with this binding, thereby neutralizing the virus (Figure 1\n). The structure of the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 was solved in record time at high resolution, contributing to our understanding of this vaccine target (Lan et al., 2020a, Wrapp et al., 2020). Therefore, we have a target antigen that can be incorporated into advanced vaccine platforms.",

Most of these vaccines protect animals from challenge with SARS-CoV-1, although many do not induce sterilizing immunity. In some cases, vaccination with the live virus results in complications, including lung damage and infiltration of eosinophils in a mouse model (e.g., Bolles et al., 2011, Tseng et al., 2012) and liver damage in ferrets (e.g., Weingartl et al., 2004). In another study, vaccination with inactivated SARS-CoV-1 led to enhancement of disease in one NHP, whereas it protected 3 animals from challenge (Wang et al., 2016). The same study identified certain epitopes on the S protein as protective, whereas immunity to others seemed to be enhancing disease. However, in almost all cases, vaccination is associated with greater survival, reduced virus titers, and/or less morbidity compared with that in unvaccinated animals. Similar findings have been reported for MERS-CoV vaccines (Agrawal et al., 2016, Houser et al., 2017). Therefore, whereas vaccines for related coronaviruses are efficacious in animal models, we need to ensure that the vaccines, which are developed for SARS-CoV-2, are sufficiently safe.",

Infection with human coronaviruses does not always induce long-lived antibody responses, and re-infection of an individual with the same virus is possible after an extended period of time (but only in a fraction of individuals and resulting in mild or no symtpoms), as shown in human challenge studies (Callow et al., 1990). Antibody titers in individuals that survived SARS-CoV-1 or MERS-CoV infections often waned after 2\u20133 years (Liu et al., 2006, Wu et al., 2007) or were weak initially (Choe et al., 2017). Despite that, re-infections are unlikely in the short term. Of note, re-infections after days of recovery have been reported recently but appear to be the consequences of false negative test results (Lan et al., 2020b). However, they could happen when humoral immunity wanes over months and years. An effective SARS-CoV-2 vaccine will need to overcome these issues to protect in a scenario in which the virus becomes endemic and causes recurrent seasonal epidemics.",

The reason for this is not clear, but many viral infections have milder manifestations in naive younger individuals than in naive older individuals. Because older individuals are more affected, it will be important to develop vaccines that protect this segment of the population. Unfortunately, older individuals typically respond less well to vaccination because of immune senescence (Sambhara and McElhaney, 2009). For influenza, which is problematic for older adults, specific formulations for this segment of the population include more antigen or an adjuvant (DiazGranados et al., 2013, Tsai, 2013). Protection in older individuals appears to require higher neutralization titers against influenza virus than in younger individuals (Benoit et al., 2015), and this issue might need to be addressed for SARS-CoV-2. If vaccination in older individuals is not effective, they could still benefit indirectly if vaccination is able to stop transmission of the virus in younger individuals.",

Results from these trials, performed with an inactivated virus vaccine and a spike-based DNA vaccine, are encouraging because the vaccines were safe and induced neutralizing antibody titers (Lin et al., 2007, Martin et al., 2008). Some neutralizing monoclonal antibodies isolated against SARS-CoV-1, like CR3022 (ter Meulen et al., 2006, Tian et al., 2020), can cross-react to the receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2. This suggests that SARS-CoV-1 vaccines might cross-protect against SARS-CoV-2. However, because these vaccines have not been developed further than phase I, they are currently not available for use. Vaccines against MERS-CoV, also targeting the MERS-CoV S protein, are in pre-clinical and clinical development, including vaccines based on modified vaccinia Ankara vectors, adenovirus vectors, and DNA-based vaccines, and several of them are supported by the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovation (CEPI) (Yong et al., 2019). However, it is unlikely that MERS-CoV vaccines induce strong cross-neutralizing antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 because of the phylogenetic distance between the two viruses. Nevertheless, we can still learn a lot from these vaccines about how to move forward with SARS-CoV-2 vaccine design (Pallesen et al., 2017).",

Because no coronavirus vaccines are on the market and no large-scale manufacturing capacity for these vaccines exists as yet (Table 1\n), we will need to build these processes and capacities. Doing this for the first time can be tedious and time consuming (Figure 1). CEPI has awarded funds to several highly innovative players in the field, and many of them will likely succeed in eventually making a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. However, none of these companies and institutions have an established pipeline to bring such a vaccine to late-stage clinical trials that allow licensure by regulatory agencies, and they do not currently have the capacity to produce the number of doses needed. An mRNA-based vaccine, which expresses target antigen in vivo in the vaccinee after injection of mRNA encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles, co-developed by Moderna and the Vaccine Research Center at the National Institutes of Health, is currently the furthest along, and a phase I clinical trial recently started (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04283461). Curevac is working on a similar vaccine but is still in the pre-clinical phase. Additional approaches in the pre-clinical stage include recombinant-protein-based vaccines (focused on the S protein, e.g., ExpresS2ion, iBio, Novavax, Baylor College of Medicine, University of Queensland, and Sichuan Clover Biopharmaceuticals), viral-vector-based vaccines (focused on the S protein, e.g., Vaxart, Geovax, University of Oxford, and Cansino Biologics), DNA vaccines (focused on the S protein, e.g., Inovio and Applied DNA Sciences), live attenuated vaccines (Codagenix with the Serum Institute of India, etc.), and inactivated virus vaccines (Figure 1; Table 1). All of these platforms have advantages and disadvantages (Table 1), and it is not possible to predict which strategy will be faster or more successful. Johnson & Johnson (J&J) (Johnson & Johnson, 2020) and Sanofi (2020) recently joined efforts to develop SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. However, J&J is using an experimental adenovirus vector platform that has not yet resulted in a licensed vaccine. Sanofi\u2019s vaccine, to be made using a process similar to the process used for their approved Flublok recombinant influenza virus vaccine (Zhou et al., 2006), is also months, if not years, from being ready for use in the human population.",

In addition, many technologies used (production platforms, vectors, etc.) are new and need to be tested thoroughly for safety. The target for the vaccine, the S protein, has been identified, and vaccine candidates are being generated. This is usually followed by two important steps that are typically needed before bringing a vaccine into clinical trials. First, the vaccine is tested in appropriate animal models to see whether it is protective. However, animal models for SARS-CoV-2 might be difficult to develop. The virus does not grow in wild-type mice and only induced mild disease in transgenic animals expressing human ACE2 (Bao et al., 2020). Other potential animal models include ferrets and NHPs, for which pathogenicity studies are ongoing. Even in the absence of an animal model that replicates human disease, it is possible to evaluate the vaccine because serum from vaccinated animals can be tested in in vitro neutralization assays. Post-challenge safety data should also be collected in these cases to assess for complications such as the ones seen SARS-CoV-1 and MERS-CoV vaccines. Second, vaccines need to be tested for toxicity in animals, e.g., in rabbits. Usually, viral challenge is not part of this process, because only the safety of the vaccine will be evaluated. This testing, which has to be performed in a manner compliant with GLP (Good Laboratory Practice), typically takes 3\u20136 months to complete. For some vaccine platforms, parts of the safety testing might be skipped if there is already sufficient data available for similar vaccines made in the same production process.",

It is unlikely that the same viruses that are chosen as vaccine candidates will later cause outbreaks. However, if the vaccine candidate is sufficiently closely related, sequences for the vaccines could be quickly switched and the vaccines for the newly emerging viruses could be swiftly produced and moved to late-stage clinical trials right away (while large-scale production is ramped up globally). In addition, stockpiled vaccines based on the initial candidates could be deployed, even if slightly mismatched to the strain causing the outbreak (a strategy that is currently used for H5 and H7 avian influenza virus vaccines). This would allow a response within a few weeks and could potentially stop a virus locally before it becomes pandemic. An alternative but challenging solution would be the development of broadly protective vaccines that cover whole virus families or genera. This effort is ongoing for influenza viruses (Erbelding et al., 2018) and could potentially be applied to coronaviruses, or at least betacoronaviruses. Both of these options are costly and require global political will and vision.",

However, without a pandemic looming, such investments have rarely been made in the past, except for H5 and H7 subtype influenza viruses. Now would be the right time to consider investing in vaccines against emerging viruses that can lead to loss of human lives and burden the global economy. An investment of a few billion dollars would allow us to have sufficient surveillance, appropriate vaccine candidates, and infrastructure ready that could churn out vaccines for use in the global population quickly and effectively, potentially stopping an emerging virus in its tracks. In addition, we need well-developed emergency plans that allow us to develop, test, produce, and distribute vaccines within weeks, not months or years. This would need tight coordination among pharmaceutical companies, governments, regulatory agencies, and the World Health Organization (WHO), as well as novel and out-of-the-box approaches to cGMP production, release processes, regulatory science, and clinical trial design.",

The S protein is the major target for vaccine development. The spike structure shown is based on the trimeric SARS-CoV-1 spike (PDB: 5XL3). One trimer is shown in dark blue, and the receptor binding domain, a main target of neutralizing antibodies, is highlighted in purple. The other two trimers are shown in light blue. SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidates based on different vaccine platforms have been developed, and for some of them, pre-clinical experiments have been initiated. For one mRNA-based candidate, a clinical trial recently started to enroll volunteers shortly (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04283461). However, many additional steps are needed before these vaccines can be used in the population, and this process might take months, if not years. 1For some candidates, cGMP processes have already been established. 2Clinical trial design might be altered to move vaccines through clinical testing quicker.",
