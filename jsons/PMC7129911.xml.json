If no infectious agent can be identified, immune-based arthritis (feline non-infective polyarthritis) is suspected. According to radiographic appearance immune-based polyarthritis is divided into erosive and non-erosive forms (Bennett and Nash 1988). This differentiation can be very difficult particularly in the early stages, as radiographic signs appear later in the disease course (Carr and Michels 1997). The main types of erosive immune-based polyarthritis are the periosteal proliferative form with marked periostal new bone formation and the rheumatoid form, resembling rheumatoid arthritis in humans and dogs. Non-erosive arthritis is seen in cases of systemic lupus erythematosus (uncommon), in association with a chronic infective process elsewhere in the body, gastrointestinal disease and neoplastic diseases (Bennett and Nash 1988).",

A direct smear was prepared and the cell number was estimated by counting the number of cells per high-power field (395 cells/high-power field/400\u00d7; normal < 2 cells/field, Jacques et al 2002; 86.5% neutrophils and 13.5% mononuclear cells \u2013 predominantly macrophages, some ragocytes/macrophages with multiple small purple cytoplasmic inclusions, thought to represent nuclear remnants or phagocytosed immune complexes). The diagnosis at that time was inflammatory joint disease with reactive hyperplasia of the lymph nodes. Differential diagnosis included immune-based erosive arthritis (rheumatoid arthritis or an early form of feline periosteal proliferative polyarthritis) and infective polyarthritis. The cat tested negative for antinuclear antibodies (titre < 1:40, anti-cat IgG (H + L); Hep-2-cell slide, The Binding Site) rheumatoid factor (modified Rose \u2013 Waaler test), FIV (antibodies \u2013 immunochromatography, antigen in synovia \u2013 real time polymerase chain reaction), FCV (antibodies \u2013 immunochromatography) and FLV (Antigen Test Kit; IDEXX) infections.

Bacteriological examination of synovial fluid from both joints revealed abundant growths of mycoplasmas on modified Hayflicks' medium only under anaerobic conditions (Spergser et al 2002). Mycoplasma isolates were identified as M gateae by colony immunoblotting, using specific rabbit hyperimmune sera against feline mycoplasma species (Rosengarten and Yogev 1996).

The cat described did not show significant bone lesions on the radiograph, but subchondral erosions of the bone were found at post-mortem examination. This cat also had fever, mild anaemia, bilirubinuria, hypoproteinaemia, leukocytosis and kidney failure due to glomerulonephritis; clinical signs also seen in our cat. It did not have lymphadenopathy, but an enlargement of the regional lymph nodes was seen in experimentally infected cats.",

Cold agglutinins can be found in 50% of human patients with M pneumoniae infection. The mechanism by which the autoimmune disease occurs is still controversial (Hahn 2005). Signs usually appear 2\u20133 weeks after infection starts. Extra- and intravascular haemolysis (Gehrs and Friedberg 2002) and thrombocytopenia (Venkatesan et al 1996) are possible. Renal complications (interstitial nephritis and glomerulonephritis) are seen in less than 10% of human patients with atypical pneumonia caused by M pneumoniae (Sauter et al 1989). They are thought to be of post infectious aetiology associated with intravascular accumulation of immunoglobulins (Van Westrhenen et al 1998). Autoantibodies causing haemolytic anaemia can be seen in cats with M haemofelis infection (Zulty and Kociba 1990). We hypothesise that the Coombs' positive anaemia, thrombocytopenia and the renal failure of our cat could have been a direct sequel of mycoplasma infection. It is also possible that our cat was producing antibodies against red cell precursors, as only slight regeneration was seen for a short period.",

The non-regenerative anaemia diagnosed at the first day of presentation could have been caused by a pre-existing immune-mediated disease. The antinuclear antibody titre, a hallmark of SLE was negative, but seronegative cases of SLE have been described in other species (Pederson and Barlough 1991). It is possible, that the mycoplasma infection was secondary. The secondary infection would then explain the erosive polyarthritis not usually seen in SLE. As the histopathological examination of the synovial membrane showed no inflammatory infiltrates, rheumatoid arthritis as a pre-existing disease seems unlikely. Periosteal new bone formation, typical in the proliferative form of feline chronic progressive polyarthritis was not seen.",
