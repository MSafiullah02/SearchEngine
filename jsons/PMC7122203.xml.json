For Ulrike Beck , \u201crisks are always future events that may occur, that threaten us \u201d (Beck, 2009, p. 9). There are many types of risks in an organization\u2019s environment and these change constantly and so do the risk stakeholders. Risks can come from various sources in the environment, including uncertainty, human error, natural causes and disasters. Risk management involves processes for identification, analysis and evaluation of risks. In crisis management, risk management has been conceived mainly as a proactive pre-crisis management effort where it is deployed for crisis prevention and preparedness efforts (Coombs, 2015). In this chapter, I argue that risk management extends into the entire crisis management continuum. Crises ignite new types of risks with their associated stakeholders. Organizations should continually identify, manage and communicate risks to key stakeholders during the different phases of crisis management. A stakeholder orientation demands that organizations seek and involve risk stakeholders in the risk management process. The level of involvement will depend on both the identified risks and how stakeholders are expected to be affected by the proposed solutions and decision-making processes.",

These stakeholders are dynamic and likely to change during the course of the process. Some are constant, while others come and go, and others may join in at different stages of the process. Therefore, it is important for the organization to engage with these stakeholders. Stakeholder participation in the risk management process is becoming increasingly recognized as a means of producing decisions that are responsive to the varying interests and values (Jardine, 2008). The benefits of engaging stakeholders are many and include a better understanding of the risk, building trust and credibility as stakeholders feel involved in decision-making and actions affecting their future, stakeholders feel that their interests are taken seriously by the organization. Engagement generates mutual understanding and sharing of responsibility if things go wrong. It also allows risk stakeholders to express their opinion on the risk and the actions taken by the organization to address it, as well as its potential outcome. Engaging with a variety of stakeholders provides a platform for different voices to be heard. Different risk stakeholders can be consulted at different stages of the risk management process.",

It entails persuasive efforts by risk communicators to change the behaviours, attitudes and opinions of specific groups or stakeholders regarding a risk issue. Miller (1980) defines persuasive communication as any message that is intended to shape, reinforce or change the responses of another or others. Persuasion includes \u201cany effort to modify an individual\u2019s evaluation of people, objects or issues by the presentation of a message\u201d (Petty & Cacioppo, 1987, p. 25). Persuasive communication emphasizes the notion of change, be it change of attitude, behaviour, habits, emotions or beliefs about an issue. Hence any message that is intended to shape, reinforce or change the responses of another, or others, will be defined as persuasive communication (Stiff, 1994, p. 10).",

Emphasis of communication is placed on the quality of evidence that is offered to support the conclusion. Rational persuasion emphasizes the importance of supporting information. However, the persuasiveness of the message is dependent on the motivation and ability of the recipient to process the message contained in the message (Petty & Cacioppo, 1987). Stakeholders who are motivated and fully engaged with the risk issue are more likely to fully scrutinize the message than those who are less engaged. Different stakeholders engage differently in risk issues and hence the importance of adapting the message to the degree of engagement. The degree of stakeholder engagement and their ability to interpret the message is a determinant factor in the understanding of the message and the attitude to change. As such, rational persuasion techniques require that the targeted stakeholders make an active effort in receiving and processing the risk message.",

Emotional appeals tap into the subconscious as opposed to the conscious mind. This approach uses manipulation of the emotions to influence the message recipients. This approach is used in different fields including marketing and advertising, where communicators target the subconscious mind through eye-catching adverts. Fear appeals have been used in prevention and safety campaigns, such as Don\u2019t Drink and Drive campaigns, the use of seat belts, cigarette smoking and HIV/Aids. In these campaigns, fear-arousing messages, often accompanied by gruesome images, have been used to motivate the target groups to change their behaviour or attitude.",

As noted in Gutteling and Wiegman (1996), to some risk communication researchers, especially those who hold an implicit technical view of risk communication, there is no problem in trying to reach agreement between the source and the receiver by applying persuasive tools. Other researchers, however, argue that using persuasion communication strategies is not acceptable and contradicts the goals of fairness. More recently, there has been a shift in the understanding of risk communication from merely a one-way communication flow to an emphasis on a two-way communication process involving sharing of information and promoting dialogue between technical experts and stakeholders. This approach acknowledges the concerns of stakeholders. Properly applied dialogue-based risk communication can help stakeholders and experts to share knowledge and understanding of the risk issue. Dialogue is aimed at ensuring that a diverse range of people share a common understanding of the risk issue with the organizations/individuals in charge of managing the risk concerned.",

The aim of dialogue-based risk communication is to bring together diverse stakeholders in risk knowledge creation and sharing. This approach recognizes that certain risks are complex and multidisciplinary and hence need to be addressed through dialogue with, and participation by, diverse stakeholders. Increasing stakeholder participation raises the likelihood of the message being credible. There is a growing realization by risk researchers that for risk communication to be effective, it should have a stakeholder perspective. Dialogue-based perspectives are captured in the definition of risk communication by Lang, Fewtrell, and Bartram (2001): \u201c[R]isk communication is any purposeful exchange of information about risks between interested parties.\u201d In their \u2018General Principles of Food Safety Risk Management\u2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) hold that \u201crisk management should include clear, interactive communication with consumers and other interested parties in all aspects of the process\u201d. In its project to investigate what type of communication would improve the public understanding of flood risk and encourage people to take action, the British Environment Agency (2015) carried out a major public dialogue project on flood risk communication. In its project evaluation it found that \u201cgetting people and communities involved in talking about flood risks increases people\u2019s understanding of local flood risk and can help them on a journey towards making preparations to protect themselves against flooding\u201d (Environment Agency, 2015).",

The stakeholders, the risk information (message), the channels and the customizing of risk information to the audiences\u2019 needs are necessary for more adequate risk communication (Gutteling & Wiegman, 1996). Blanchard-Boehm (1998) proposes a model that presupposes that the process of risk communication is one whereby individuals (1) hear a warning message ; (2) understand its content; (3) internalize or believe the salience of its message; (4) confirm their interpretation with others and (5) act or respond to its message to save their life and property. Morgan and Lave (1990) argue that risk messages must be understood by the recipients, and their impacts and effectiveness must be understood by the communicator. A persuasive message is more likely to be effective if the communicator is credible, trusted (depends on qualification and identification), and knowledgeable (expertise). Atwood and Major (1998) argue that individuals who have experienced predictions of disasters that do not materialize will discount the validity of subsequent disaster warnings. The trustworthiness of the sender of a risk message, that is, using trusted sources of information, will enhance the public\u2019s compliance with risk messages. Important components of trust include openness, honesty, responsiveness, accuracy, fairness and concern. In addition, the risk message should be tailored to intended audiences, taking into consideration their linguistic skills. The readability of the risk messages should match the target audience\u2019s comprehension levels. The choice of message delivery modes should be informed by the target audience\u2019s communication habits.",

Communicating with stakeholders during the outbreak of foodborne diseases, that is, those threats posed by contaminated food, pathogenic bacteria and viruses, presents a series of challenges. These include the consistency of the messages, their persuasiveness and the stakeholder characteristics. Food chain security is a highly complex issue often involving a multitude of stakeholders. The whole national economic sector of food production and distribution is vulnerable to a local accident (Brunet & Houbaert, 2007). The stakeholders involved are not monolithic blocks but very dynamic entities. In their study of the Belgian fowl pest crisis, Brunet and Houbaert (2007) note how during the fowl pest crisis, a new group of influential stakeholders emerged: stakeholders who were not used to communicating with public authorities responsible for the food chain. The authorities, for their part, were not quickly able to establish a valid understanding of these stakeholders during the crisis. \u201cUnless the stakeholders likely to be implicated in any crisis are explicitly recognized, therefore, it is likely that some of those who need to be protected from the adverse consequences of the event will be neglected or poorly served\u201d (Brunet & Houbaert, 2007, p. 647). In light of the cross-border dimensions of food safety, there have been efforts at international level to coordinate food risk messages. For example, the International Food Safety Authorities Network (INFOSAN) connects national authorities from around the world. Its objective is to prevent the international spread of foodborne disease by promoting the rapid exchange of information during food safety events, sharing information on food safety issues and promoting collaboration between countries.",

New approaches to risk communication advocate a more inclusive two-way process of communication, placing more emphasis on the interaction between the communicator and the audience. The new perspectives focus on risk communication as a dialogue or as a dynamic exchange of information. The interactive perspective on health risk communication moves beyond the old view of a passive receiver and instead focuses on how health risk messages can elicit different responses depending on (a) who communicates them, (b) how they are communicated and (c) how the public actively processes the information (Lemal & Merrick, 2013). Researchers in health risk communication have cited the following principles as being central for increasing the effectiveness of risk communication.Engage in a dialogue with the audienceExplain risk informationSimplify and personalize risk messagesRecognize the validity of public concerns (Williams, 2004)",

In their study of the coverage of the 2009 swine flu pandemic by major US newspapers, Yu, Frohlich, Fougner, and Ren (2013) argue that generally audiences assess a health risk and make judgements about their daily-life behaviours based on the perceived severity of the disease presented by the media. They note how in the case of the 2009 swine flu pandemic, fear of the H1N1 flu swept around the world faster than the virus itself. The frame of fear and anxiety is not new in media coverage of health risk. Blakely\u2019s research shows how the New York Times framed the 1918, 1957 and 1968 flu pandemics through the lens of anxiety and fear (quoted in Yu et al., 2013).",

Scientists and policymakers often complain that the media misrepresent risk statistics and distort the facts, by, for example, giving a platform to scaremongers and mavericks and seeking out \u201cdoom-laden scenarios\u201d (Kitzinger, 1999). This has been particularly the case in the coverage of health pandemics. The media reporting on health pandemics such as bird flu, SARS and so on bears testimony to the increased competition to frame the risks. It is often the negative frame (lives likely to be lost) that reaches the public domain rather than the positive frame (lives likely to be saved). In reporting risk in health, the media do not operate in the same way as (or necessarily reflect the mainstream views of) doctors, scientists, researchers or health officials in presenting information to the public (Greenberg, Sachsman, Sandman, & Salomone, 1989; Kitzinger, 1999; Rothman & Lichter, 1987). The media play a significant role in raising risk awareness, engaging the public in debate, investigating alternatives and promoting transparency and inclusive communication policies. Different groups of stakeholders interpret risks differently, and so do the media. There are dangers, therefore, of a risk gap developing between an organization and its stakeholders due to media framing.",

It would enable the communicator to design better risk messages, customize messages for specific target groups and ensure that stakeholders receive relevant messages. It is equally important for the communicator that the stakeholders want to be involved. One-way forms of communication, in which the stakeholders are mainly seen as receivers of information from experts, are no longer considered acceptable. Risk communication is now a two-way form of communication, with emphasis on interaction and dialogue between an organization and its stakeholders. Hence communications that enhance interactions, elicit responses and generate dialogue are preferable. Openness (e.g. involving representatives from affected stakeholders) enables an organization to get input from outside the organization, thereby improving the quality of interactions. A dynamic, flexible risk communication approach that involves stakeholders at every possible stage can enhance the effectiveness and credibility of risk communication throughout the crisis management cycle.",
