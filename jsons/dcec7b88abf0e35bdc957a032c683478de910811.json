These twin forces also strongly influence the competitive environment in which firms are enmeshed and the role their strategies play in the evolution of economies and industries. Understanding the relational dynamics between technological change and globalization on the one hand and country-based institutional and firm-based strategic responses on the other can provide possible explanations as to why industries have evolved into the structures that exist today, as well as offer insights into how these structures will continue to evolve. In our study we observed recursive ebbs and flows between the technological and globalization factors that conditioned the developmental path of a country's economy, affected the industrial trajectory and competitive environment existing in the integrated-circuit industry, and influenced the survival of firms competing in that industry.",

We begin by focusing on one of the forces pushing industries toward globalization. Because of the actions of managers attempting to make their firms more strategically competitive, technological innovation has become a key element driving the process of globalization. Attempts at becoming more competitive within a given national market by introducing new products and processes have resulted in making the two forces of technological innovation and globalization a self-reinforcing process that throughout this chapter we call technoglobalization (Meth\u00e9, 1992b) . The forces of technological change and globalization are inextricably linked. The critical mechanism linking technological change and the globalization of industries is found in the fact that the effort to gain competitive advantage from technological innovation requires substantial and increasing investments in terms of tangible resources, especially human and financial, and intangible resources as well as time. These investments in resources in turn require larger markets to recoup a return, driving firms beyond their own national market to compete in many countries' markets.",

We will discuss some of these factors below, but a full discussion of them is beyond the scope of this chapter. For now, it is important to recognize that although the degree of convergence varies from country to country because of differences in the macroenvironmental and institutional conditions of each country, and the legacies these impart as economies develop and standards of living rise, the demand for various goods converges asymptotically on a global standard.",

Greater standardization among product attributes is occurring in order to meet converging customer needs, allowing companies to amortize their increasing research and development resource allocations over these markets. Firm managers create organizational forms through the development of strategies. The strategies that are more effective and efficient in accomplishing the tasks associated with the techno-global process result in organizational forms that survive and grow. Over time, the evolutionary mechanisms of variation, selection, and retention are at work on the organizational forms operating in an industry. These mechanisms operate on many levels, and the selection and retention of successful organizational forms is accomplished according to many different criteria.",

As a result, another of the outcomes of techno-globalization at the product level is that it often impels firms to confront similar managerial issues concerning resource allocation, creating contexts in which they can adopt similar structures and strategic behaviors in short, similar organizational forms. The products and applications of hightechnology industries, especially the semiconductor industry generally and the integrated-circuit industry more specifically, are fairly standard around the world, and it is possible to talk about a global integrated-circuit industry and global markets for its products. 1 Consequently, if techno-global forces worked unimpeded over time in the semiconductor industry, it could be expected that similar organizational forms would eventually dominate the industry.",

Consequently, the institutional environment of the country of origin and the strategic approach taken by firms within that environment at the time of entry into the integrated-circuit industry can introduce variations in the organizational forms that would come to dominate the industry.",

For now, it is important to recognize that the organizational form selected by managers at the time of entry and the adjustments in the strategic approach that result in alterations of the organizational form are then selected against by an evolving techno-global and institution-influenced competitive environment. The picture is further complicated because at times the techno-global and institutional forces may be acting in concert, each reinforcing the effects of the other, and at other times working against one another, thus mutating the direct influence of each.",

Institutions run the gamut from very macro-societal structures, such as educational or political systems, to the very micro, such as the values and beliefs set inside an individual. They will further range from the tangible, such as codified laws mandating some type of behavior (how to patent an idea, for example), to the intangible, such as attitudes about risk and failure that exist in a societal and psychological milieu (see Meth\u00e9, 2005 , for a discussion of how risk attitudes affect the generation of entrepreneurial ventures in Japan).",

Eventually the institutions take on \"lives of their own\" separate from the agents that generated them and thus become an outside force or factor that agents must contend with in order to carry out their daily activities. An environment is created where agents and institutions exist and interact. Human agents interacting may perceive institutions as \"outside\" their interaction and consequently constituting their environment, but these institutions are the result of these human interactions.",

This simple statement provides guidance for a vast array of decisions concerning technology choices, human and financial resource allocation decisions, and the relationships between various actors in and around the integrated-circuit industry. To the cognoscenti, these meta-rules offer insight into the intricacies of the workings of the techno-global and institutional arenas, but they also can obfuscate because they offer no concrete sets of advice on how to select or adjust an organizational form strategically to those intricacies.

In the process of enculturation, cognitions become rooted in the group and ultimately exist independently of any individual group member, even though individuals are the carriers of culture (White, 1959) .\" Hence the differences observed to exist between the collective sense making of groups (and in this study we can mean groups writ large, such as whole countries) and the sense making of individuals put values, beliefs, conventions, and norms that is, the elements of institutions outside of and above individuals.",

Doubleloop learning occurs when the underlying values of the system are examined and altered as part of the process of correcting an error. This type of learning brings about double-loop change, which occurs at more than one level of a system, and we term it heterodynamic change. The idea of types of change being bipolar also has a long history in the field of organization study (see one early example in  for an interesting review of change-related studies see Barnett and Carroll, 1995) .

However, in economic, social, or political situations, it is possible to change the rules in certain circumstances. In fact, often the first key to success is determining the game that is being played and understanding when to play within the rules and when to exert force to change the rules. In such a case the debate may move up to a discussion of the rules, about how the rules of the game can be changed. Again we may find ourselves in a self-referential loop, with the institutionalization of rules on how to change them and so on, moving up some never-ending spiral.",

Three sources of institutional change have been identified: functional pressures resulting from performance gaps, political pressures resulting from shifts in interest or power distribution, and social pressures that emanate from the introduction of divergent or heterogeneous belief and value systems. One important way of characterizing an institutional regimen is the extent to which it tolerates deviation from its fundamental or core conventions.

For two basic reasons: first, the limited information-processing capabilities of the human mind, and second, the fact that institutions are part of a larger environment.

Our ability to comprehend our world and process information about its condition is limited by the cost of searching for that information and the availability of the information itself. We are often not fully aware of the characteristics of the problems we confront, the possible range of alternatives available, and the consequences of these alternatives.

While individuals and organizations have compensatory mechanisms to extract as much information as possible from an event and attempt to accumulate knowledge by pooling that information across diverse contexts (March et al., 1991) , faulty information processing often leads to judgments based on biased perceptions (Beyer et al., 1997) and superstition. Often the way in which a choice is framed or interpreted will affect the decision outcome even when the alternatives and their attendant probabilities are known (Tversky and Kahneman, 1991) .

These strategic decisions by firms on product-market combinations affect choices concerning the technologies used to design and produce the products. These choices alter the technological options available, since some technologies are chosen for further development and others are not. Those chosen for development open up alternative paths for economies and societies to follow.

The greater the access to financial resources and qualified people, the more easily start-ups are able to enter. This, in turn, creates opportunities for new types of organizational forms to enter, and with these the introduction of new agent institution relationships. The importance of the entry of new organizational forms is that economic and social progress derives not only from the technology itself, but also from the new agent institution relationships that emerge from attempts to improve the technological base. Certain organizational forms are more likely to generate certain kinds of technological improvements that range from radical to incremental. New organizational forms are more closely associated with radical types of innovations that redefine existing relationships and are more likely to come from entrepreneurial start-ups than from incumbent firms (Meth\u00e9 et al., 1996) . We will turn our attention to issues concerning organizational forms below.

The importance of these distinctions can be simply illustrated by the example of the facsimile machine (see Flatow, 1992 , for a more detailed and colorful description). The actual invention of the fax machine occurred in 1843, when the first patents for the basic principles and a working model were introduced, and innovation occurred when a fax transmission system was introduced between Lyon and Paris, France in 1865 70. The diffusion of the innovation was slow, since its use was discontinued after several years.

For now, it is important to consider what impact these types of invention-innovation categories can have on the existing relationships between agents and institutions and what changes in these relationships can lead to the rise or fall of organizations. Previous research has indicated that the greater the probability of radical technological change, the greater the potential for change in the relationship between the relevant agents, which in turn leads to a greater likelihood of the emergence of new organizational forms (Tushman and Anderson, 1986; Henderson and Clark, 1990; Meth\u00e9 et al., 1996) . These new forms in turn generate new agent institution interactions that may put pressure on existing organizational forms. The degree of coexistence between the new and incumbent forms is affected not only by the amount of environmental munificence, but also by the institutional rules governing the legitimacy of new forms.

Recall our discussion above of mindsets and the matching that must take place between the knowledge of the needs of the technology users and the solution or technical knowledge of the producers of that technology. One standard definition of an industry is that of a group of firms producing roughly similar products so that these products are more or less substitutable for each other. For example, the makers of refrigerators have a wide variety of products with the similar function of keeping food cool or frozen in order to preserve it. This corresponds to the consumers' perspective that the various types of refrigerators all have common attributes, the most important of which is to keep food fresh. These common attributes make up the demand side of the economic equation. Often this is referred to as a market. The producers of refrigerators, however, may also produce air conditioners, humidifiers, washing machines, clothes dryers, convection ovens, and microwave ranges. This may be because these items share some similar technical characteristics either in their design, the materials they use, or the way in which they are manufactured or perhaps even distributed and maintained after sales. This is the supply side of the economic equation. Often this is referred to as an industry. The firm is at the nexus of these two sides of the equation. The consumer would be highly unlikely to attempt to substitute a washing machine for a refrigerator, but the firm may decide to do so by exiting the refrigerator industry and entering the washing machine industry.",

The term \"resources\" covers a wide range of elements that the firm needs to exist. In this view, customers are considered a resource because they buy the firm's products. As we noted above, resources are also the human and financial inputs needed to conduct research and development as well as production and sales. Beyond these tangible resources, other more intangible elements, such as access to political, social, and educational networks and the firm's legitimacy and reputation, would also be included. Consequently, not only the techno-global environment, but also the institutional environment will directly affect the availability and necessity of many of the resources the firm will seek to acquire.

Changing the technical characteristics of the product to better meet the required attributes of the customers is a function of altering various elements of the product, such as its design, materials, and manufacturing processes. Changes in one of the elements that go into a product may require and/or stimulate changes in other elements. For example, changing the design of the product to add new features may require the addition of new materials and thus the development of new manufacturing equipment. Thus innovation in one focal product is often the result of innovations in the inputs going into that product. The technology trajectory of the focal product forms an innovation envelope for the elements needed to design and make that focal product. Further, the potential for innovation in the focal product is a function of the cumulative potentials of the elements that make up the innovation envelope for that product (Meth\u00e9, 1985 (Meth\u00e9, , 1991a Sahal, 1981a) .",

So, for example, steel, aluminum, and chemical firms supply not only critical inputs, but also innovations in those inputs to automobile makers and other users of those materials. The inputs allow for current production of automobiles as a product, but innovation in the inputs allows for potential innovation in the automobiles as a technology. How a firm arranges the links among the various technologies that make up a focal product's innovation envelope can impact the pace and direction of the focal product's technology trajectory.

These organizational forms are usually classified in terms of their degree of specialization within a population's resource niche and range from very specialized types to generalist types (Carroll, 1985) . The degree of specialization is a strategic choice that guides the firm in terms of what resources it will acquire and how it will structure these resources to survive in the environment.

The integrated circuit (IC) is a device that is a type of semiconductor. A semiconductor is an element, such as silicon or germanium, whose electrical conductivity lies between a conductor, such as copper, and an insulator, such as glass. It has the property to either hold an electrical charge or let it pass through. As such it can act as a switch by being on or off. From our discussion of technology it is important to remember that this technical characteristic of being an electrical switch must be matched with various customer needs for the technology to be embodied into a product. The need for switches is quite large; hence the demand for integrated-circuit products has been growing. The semiconductor industry we know today began with the invention of the solid-state transistor on December 23, 1947, at AT&T Bell Laboratories. The integrated circuit industry that exists today began with the invention of the integrated circuit in 1958. Both of these inventions are considered radical inventions because they created whole new industries that opened up the opportunity for the entry of collections of firms sharing common organ-izational forms different from those used by incumbent firms. Although not as radical as the two previous inventions, the invention of two particular types of integrated circuit the dynamic random access memory (DRAM) device in 1970 and the microprocessor in 1974 by Intel also fundamentally shaped the competitive topography of the integrated-circuit industry.",

At the time he first talked about it, Moore stated that the number of components (now often measured in terms of the number of transistors) on a single integrated-circuit chip would double every year. The rate of this doubling began to slow in the mid-1970s, but has held constant since then at about a doubling of components every 18 24 months.

The driving goal has been and continues to be to put more and more components onto the integrated-circuit device. This can be accomplished in a number of ways. One is to increase the size, referred to as the die area, of the device. There are limits to this, of course, since to increase the die area continually would result in the world's biggest microchip. If you cannot increase the die size of the device, you must reduce the size of the components that go onto it. This has been the fundamental approach to increasing the number of components on an integrated-circuit device. One way that this size has been measured is by calculating the width of the circuits on the device. A DRAM device, in the late 1980s, that could store about 1 million bits (1 megabit, or 1 Mb) of information had a circuit width of just less than 1 micron. The current DRAM devices that can store about 1 billion bits (1 gigabit, or 1 Gb) of information have circuit widths of about 0.13 micron.",

There are many types of equipment used in fabricating an integrated-circuit device. A key type is photolithographic equipment, which is needed to project the circuit design onto the silicon material of the device itself. This width reduction has required changes in the types of photolithographic equipment used in the integrated-circuit fabrication process (Meth\u00e9, 1985 (Meth\u00e9, , 1991a . While this has had a tremendous impact on the photolithographic industry in terms of the organizational forms of the firms that represent it (see Meth\u00e9, 1985 Meth\u00e9, , 1991a Henderson and Clark, 1990) , from the perspective of the integrated-circuit device makers, what is important about these changes in the photolithographic technology base is that the cost of the machines keeps increasing. When added up, the cost of fabricating integrated circuits has increased from about $50 million per facility in the mid-1970s to about $100 million in the mid-1980s to about $1 billion in the mid-1990s (Meth\u00e9, 1985 (Meth\u00e9, , 1991a .

            "text": "Three IDMs were extant at this time: Intel, AMD, and National. The importance here is not just that the predominant firms are Japanese, thus indicating the increasing internationalization of the industry, but that they had very special relationships not only with electronic-systems products, but also with equipment suppliers, many of whom were Japanese (Meth\u00e9, 1985 (Meth\u00e9, , 1991b ; also see Okada, 2002) . As shown in these other works, one of the main reasons for the ascendancy of Japanese system houses during this period was their vertical linkage back into the equipment industry (Meth\u00e9, 1985 (Meth\u00e9, , 1991b . Again, as seen in Table 4 .1, by the mid-1990s the top 10 firms were Intel, NEC, Hitachi, Toshiba, Samsung, TI, Motorola, IBM, Mitsubishi, and Hyundai, and the dominance of system houses is quite evident. The emergence of two Korean companies signals a change, however. The most obvious implication of these two companies' appearance is that a set of players from a new national institutional setting has emerged. These two companies were in competition for some time before entering the top 10 worldwide, and their emergence signals a shift in the competitive topography of the globalizing integrated-circuit industry. A more subtle implication is that the two Korean companies, Samsung and Hyundai, are system houses because they are linked forward into the electronic systems industry, but neither has linkages back to semiconductor equipment manufacturers in the way that the Japanese firms did and still do (see Okada in this book and Wakabayashi and Sumita, 1993) . A change had occurred in the re- lationship between the equipment industry and the integrated-circuit industry. We will return to this in the next section. Again, as seen in Table 4 .1, by 2002 the top 10 firms were Intel, Samsung, TI, STMicro, TSMC, Motorola, Infineon, NEC, Toshiba, and Hitachi. By this time, about 5 of the firms Intel, TI, STMicro, TSMC, and Infineon were IDMs, and the other five were still system houses. It is important to note that we see the reemergence of European firms back into the top 10 slots. One of these firms is a spinoff from its system house; Siemens spun off Infineon in April 1999. The other, STMicro, is the result of merger activity between two European system houses (IC Insights Strategic Reviews, 2003; Fisher, 2002) . This occurred in June 1987 when Thomson Semiconducteurs, part of the microelectronics business of the French state-controlled company Thomson-CSF, and SGS Microelettronica, the microelectronics business of STET-Societa Finanziaria Telefonica, the Italian state-controlled telephone company, were spun out of their respective companies and merged to form SGS-Thomson Microelectronics. It was renamed STMicroelectronics (STMicro) in May 1998. The other important change is the emergence of a Taiwanese firm, TSMC. This is important not only because it is in Taiwan, but also because it is a pure-play foundry firm. TSMC was founded in 1987 as one of the first pure-play foundries in the semiconductor industry and reportedly held 56% of the 2002 pure-play foundry market. It is the largest semiconductor foundry company worldwide. TSMC was created as a joint venture between the Taiwan government (21%), Philips Electronics (28%), and other private investors. As of March 31, 2002 , Philips continued to own 22% of TSMC, with the ROC Development Fund owning 10%. Private investors, including employees through stock option plans, owned the remainder (IC Insights Strategic Reviews, 2003) .",

The Korean firms were also system houses coming in as diversifying entrants, but without the strong vertical links backward into equipment suppliers. It is with the entrance of the Taiwanese firms that we notice a deviation from the system house trend. Most Taiwanese firms entered as IDMs. Furthermore, the Taiwanese firm TSMC entered as a start-up, albeit a different form of start-up from the organizational form most often associated with Silicon Valley. Rather than entering as a venture capital-based start-up, it entered with the backing of the Taiwanese government and a major system house firm. Still, the emergence of TSMC is a further deviation from the trend of system house domination because it is a pure-play foundry.",

As noted earlier, the continued advance of the integrated circuit along its technology trajectory is largely dependent upon the technological advances made in semiconductor equipment, such as photolithography. As discussed in other works (Meth\u00e9, 1985 (Meth\u00e9, , 1991a , the rise of the Japanese integrated-circuit industry was closely supported by the development of a homegrown semiconductor equipment industry. These two industries' fortunes moved in tandem. Japanese firms' replacement of the U.S. and European integratedcircuit firms was mirrored in the replacement of the U.S. and European semiconductor equipment firms by Japanese firms (Meth\u00e9, 1991a) . The special relationship among the Japanese firms led to a strongly idiosyncratic form of technological innovation in integrated circuits. Each semiconductor firm, for example NEC or Hitachi, worked very closely with a specific set of equipment firms, with the resulting equipment highly customized to that semiconductor firm's fabrication process. Unless one was a member of the club, it was difficult to receive the most advanced semiconductor equipment. Confronted with this situation, the U.S. agent institution relationship changed with the founding of SE-MATECH.",

In this case, changes in technology and the globalization process, especially the emergence of Japanese firms and their subsequent domination of the DRAM industry, led to the establishment of SEMATECH. Its original purpose was as a way of enhancing the survival of U.S. firms. Although this original purpose for the establishment of SEMATECH was essentially conceived of in the context of the bipolar competition between the U.S. and Japan, its actions set in motion a number of important agent institution relationship changes in other country settings. Flowing from its original purpose, an important accomplishment of SE-MATECH was to begin standardizing the development of semiconductor equipment technology and to make progress along the various technology trajectories that make the equipment industry more transparent and open. An unintended consequence of this more transparent and open equipment development was that it facilitated the emergence of the Korean firms in the integrated-circuit industry, allowing them to acquire state-of-the-art equipment even without the parallel development of Korean equipment makers. As the Korean integrated-circuit firms grew, they became more important customers for European and U.S. equipment makers, allowing these firms to survive through the late 1980s and early 1990s. This process continued with the emergence of the Taiwanese firms in the early to mid-1990s. Again, Taiwanese firms were able to gain access to leading-edge semiconductor equipment technology as they needed it. This access became vital to the development of dedicated foundries, which, as we will discuss below, had an effect on the fate of U.S. fabless design firms.",

However, as noted in the creation of SEMATECH, the alteration of competitive strategy among U.S. firms in response to the entrance of Japanese firms, and the subsequent alterations in the agent institution relationship that existed in the U.S., had implications beyond the U.S. firms. It allowed for the growth of new forms in Korea and Taiwan and for a greater variety of relationships among those forms. One part of that variety was across industry boundaries as first Korean and then Taiwanese integrated-circuit firms became customers for U.S. and European equipment firms.

The system house IC and IDM IC firms were happy to fill in their capacity needs at the margin with the demand from the fabless firms, at least while they had idle fabrication capacity. The constant ebb and flow of demand for the IC devices produced by these sys-tem house IC and IDM IC makers often put the fabless design houses in a pinch for fabrication capacity, however. When times were bad for the system/IDM IC makers in the mainstream memory and logic IC markets, fabrication capacity was freed up for the fabless design firms, but when demand for the system/IDM IC firms' products rose in these mainstream markets, the fabless firms found themselves in a squeeze for fabrication capacity.",

            "text": "After the founding of TSMC, fabless firms were no longer on the margin in terms of fabrication capacity considerations. The dedicated foundry organizational form likewise has no meaning if fabless firms shift to an IDM type organizational form. The emergence of the dedicated foundry organizational form gained momentum as several other firms, first in Taiwan and later in other institutional environments, entered as foundries or shifted over to dedicated foundry applications in order to meet the needs of fabless design firms. We will examine these trends more closely as we look in more detail at the emergence of organizational forms in each of the national institutional settings. 3 It is not surprising that the American domestic semiconductor industry has been the dominant single-country market for the world semiconductor industry since its beginnings. This is because the industry began essentially with the invention of the transistor at Bell Laboratories and with the pioneering work on integrated-circuit design at both Intel and Texas Instruments as well as the pioneering processing technology work at Fairchild. It was that pioneering work with respect to both product and process technology development that wrested industry momentum away from the early vacuum tube manufacturers who had diversified into the emerging semiconductor transistor industry in the mid-1950s, as can be seen in Table 4 .2. By the late 1960s, the firms that would come to dominate the semiconductor industry had already begun to enter. Even though at one level there was continuity in terms of the organizational form of both the diversifying entrants and the start-ups, the older vacuum tube companies were being replaced by a new breed of diversifying entrants and start-ups.",

The emergence of another set of firms, however startups dedicated to the design and fabrication of semiconductors introduced a new organizational form, the integrated device manufacturer (IDM). The earliest was Transitron, a company started up in 1952 in Melrose, Massachusetts, to sell transistors. Later companies, such as Fairchild Semiconductor (founded in 1957), National Semiconductor (1959), Signetics (1961) , AMI (1966) , Intel (1968), AMD (1969) , and many others were started up as IDMs dedicated to the design, development, fabrication, and sale of semiconductors, especially integratedcircuit devices. Most, of these firms, but not all, were founded in the San Jose region of northern California, which is now called Silicon Valley. The firms founded there, initially with the IDM start-up organizational form and later the fabless design house organizational form, are the result of an extraordinary mixture of human, financial, and other tangible and intangible resources that has not been duplicated elsewhere in the world. This story is all the more remarkable, since it was accomplished in as close to a self-organizing system as one could expect to find. Government played no direct overarching or orchestrating role in the creation of the Silicon Valley phenomenon, although government policies on procurement, R&D funding, IPR protection, and such did influence aspects of firm strategy (Meth\u00e9, 1985; Tilton, 1971 ). This extraordinary entrepreneurial milieu is still actively generating new start-up firms even today after having sustained several boom and bust cycles in its existence.",

Signetics and National were IDM start-ups. Fairchild Semiconductor, which originated as an IDM form, in 1965 had been purchased by its main investor, Fairchild Camera and Instrument, for $3 million and was transitioning from the IDM form to the system house form. By 1975, the situation had further shifted in favor of the IDM start-ups. From the table it can be seen that 4 of the top 10 companies were using the IDM organizational form, and 4 were using the system house diversifying organizational form. Joining National were Intel, Mostek (founded in 1969), and AMD. TI, Motorola, RCA, and General Instrument (GI) followed the system house form. One other firm, Signetics, joined Fairchild in transitioning from the IDM form to the system house form. Signetics, which had started as an IDM form, had been acquired by North American Philips and as such came under the system house organizational form. Fairchild Camera and Instrument, with the Fairchild Semiconductor division, was bought by Schlumberger in 1979 and continued as an IDM within a system house organizational form.",

From the very inception of the semiconductor industry until the present time, organizations that have adopted this form, albeit not the same companies, have been present in the semiconductor industry in the U.S. Second, the IDM form, while quickly establishing itself as a viable alternative organizational form, did not come to dominate the industry until the late 1980s, more than 30 years after its first appearance. Third, the newest organizational form to emerge into the top 10 list of companies in the U.S. institutional setting, the fabless semiconductor design firm, has taken about 30 years from its first appearance to even enter this area of dominance. Fourth, in the earlier years firms were transitioning from the IDM form to the system house form, often because of difficulties that a company had in the market with an IDM form, as with the Philips acquisition of Signetics and the Schlumberger acquisition of Fairchild, or because a company with a system house form was looking for a quick entry into the semiconductor industry, as with the United Technology acquisition of Mostek. Fifth, the most recent trend in transitioning appears to be the movement from a system house organizational form to an IDM form, as in the case of Agere and to a lesser extent IBM Microelectronics and Motorola, which have all spun out their semiconductor operations into separate divisions with more autonomy, if not into separate companies.",

The origin for this configuration of the innovation envelope is found in the self-organizing processes at work in the early development of the semiconductor industry in the U.S. Like most of the semiconductor industry, the equipment supplier firms began as spinoffs and start-ups. The relationship was important, since advances in semiconductors could only be made if equipment was available to mass-produce the devices. In the early years, the center of process innovation lay more closely with the semiconductor companies. Robert Noyce's development of the Planar process for fabrication while at Fairchild is perhaps the best example of this. This put the equipment companies in a less than advantageous position relative to the semiconductor companies, which led to a less than cordial relationship from time to time.",

Electronics firms would often double-or triple-book semiconductor orders in order to be assured an adequate supply during good times. This would lead to overestimations of demand by the semiconductor companies and over-ordering of equipment from equipment makers. When demand for electronic systems slowed, the double orders were dropped and the demand for semiconductors evaporated, causing the semiconductor companies to cancel their orders for equipment. Since the semiconductor equipment was expensive and not many units were sold, the loss of even a few orders would cause the equipment companies to have difficult times maintaining technology development momentum.

The Japanese semiconductor companies were able to dominate in DRAMs, partly because of the closer ties that existed between the equipment suppliers and the semiconductor companies.

As the electronics industry globalized, especially to other parts of Asia, this need spread as well. SEMATECH's work on equipment technology facilitated the growth of Korean and Taiwanese firms by providing better information about equipment technologies.

The first was the emergence of the microprocessor and later other logic devices, such as application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs) that could be made in enough volume to drive processing technology. The second was the breaking of the bipolar orientation of the global semiconductor industry away from a U.S. Japan axis with the emergence of South Korean and later Taiwanese semiconductor companies. Both of these developments created virtuous cycles between the non-Japanese equipment suppliers and the non-Japanese semiconductor companies. The standardization of equipment technology and the more open and transparent evaluations that could be performed on it made it more readily available to new entrants. The emergence of new customers for the non-Japanese equipment suppliers drove their gradual reascendance in the market. 4 System houses that have diversified into the technology by setting up divisions or subsidiaries, some as joint ventures with U.S. companies and some entirely on their own, have dominated the European semiconductor industry. Rather than take this year by year, as we did in examining the U.S. semiconductor industry, we will examine the European industry on a firm-by-firm basis.",

First, the role of the large system houses in establishing semiconductor operations in Europe dominates all other organizational forms. IDM start-up forms did occur, but few became large or remained independent in the European institutional environment. The system house organizational form has dominated from the beginning of the European semiconductor industry. This industry was highly fragmented by national markets throughout much of its history, and much of the European demand for semiconductors more than 60% in many years was filled either by Japanese or U.S. firms. Even if generous amounts of venture capital had been available, it would have been difficult to support these newly entering firms.",

This is seen in the active participation of various national governments in the establishment of semiconductor companies. This governmental activity went further when it was recognized that national markets would not sustain the operations of national champions. Cross-border mergers were set up between various national champions. Many began occurring in the late 1980s in preparation for the 1992 unification of European markets. Governments also played a more traditional role. The various governments comprising Europe established research institutes and funded research consortia concerning semiconductors and electronic systems. BRITE and ESPRIT were two formed during the 1980s, and Interuniversity Mi-croElectronics Center (IMEC) is a current research consortium. Unlike previous consortia that focused on a limited set of objectives, IMEC is an ongoing consortium of university, business, and government researchers carrying out midterm research focused on advancing semiconductor fabrication technology.",

The line demarcating the IDM start-up and system house organizational forms is less clear in the European institutional setting than in the U.S. institutional setting. Philips and Siemens were true system houses because these two companies were connected to multiple electronics markets. Many of the European system houses were diversifying entrants from the military or industrial electronics/computer markets. The domination of the system house form also had an impact on the human resources necessary for starting up a firm. Moreover, most of the downstream customers of the semiconductors produced in Europe were the very same system houses.",

This high level of concentration was exhibited throughout the history of the European market, where the top 2 or 3 firms controlled anywhere from 70% to 90% of the market. In the U.S. the continued entry of new firms has muted the consolidation effect of mergers and acquisitions.

Two caveats need to be interjected concerning this recent trend. It is just appearing, and in its nascent form may be blunted or redirected by other environmental or institutional factors; also, the level of concentration, as noted, is higher in Europe than in the U.S., which has a substantial impact on the distribution of the resources necessary for a firm representing a particular organizational form to get established and survive.",

            "text": "The sixth trend concerns the configuration of the innovation envelope for the European semiconductor industry. Most of the semiconductor industry equipment firms in Europe were spun off from semiconductor companies, but the connection was tighter than in the U.S. case because of the connection of the semiconductor companies to the larger system houses, which in turn were often connected to larger industrial groups. Furthermore, because the European semiconductor companies often served small fragmented markets and supplied mainly domestic electronics firms, few process innovations originated in Europe relative to the U.S. and Japan. The European manufacturers were slow to move from bipolar process technology to MOS process technology and often lagged by as much as six months to a year behind their U.S. and Japanese counterparts. Because of the techno-global forces driving the semiconductor industry, those equipment firms that became competitive, such as Kulicke & Soffa and Schlumberger, did so in the less technologically advanced equipment areas and established their presence early in the U.S. or Japanese markets. 5 In the Japanese situation, as in Europe, the dominance of large diversifying system houses is evident. Unlike the European situation, the Japanese system houses were more like Philips and Siemens with connections to multiple downstream electronics markets. Although the Japanese semiconductor industry has been well covered in this volume (see Okada's chapters) as well as in other works (see Meth\u00e9, various works) , several key trends should be given additional attention. The first is that the Japanese semiconductor system houses were not all equal in terms of access to resources. There is an important distinction that must be made between system houses like NEC, Hitachi, Toshiba, Fujitsu, Oki, and Mitsubishi Electric, the sogo denki makers, who made industrial electronics and computers as well as consumer electronics, and companies like Matsushita, Sony, Sharp, and Sanyo, who focused on consumer electronics. Further, it was the sogo denki makers of semiconductors who were included in governmentsponsored research consortia, the most famous of which was the Cho LSI Kenkyu Kumiai (VLSI Research Cooperative) (Meth\u00e9, 1985) .",

            "text": "Second, the institutional environment changed over the history of the Japanese semiconductor industry from one of \"catch-up\" to one of \"integration\" and back to \"catch-up.\" This can be seen in the role of the government and the various sponsored consortia that changed as a result of the shift from the bipolar competition between the U.S. and Japan to the multipolar global industry that exists today. The effect of these consortia can be debated, but the VLSI Research Cooperative was credited with much of the success of the Japanese semiconductor companies in overtaking the United States, at least in the minds of U.S. policy makers and the leaders of the various industry associations linked to the U.S. industry. Efforts were made by the U.S. side to open up access to these Japanese government-sponsored research endeavors, and for both policy and practical reasons the Japanese government allowed foreign access to various electronics-related research programs, as seen in the SELETE program. The focus also shifted within these programs away from the more practical aspects of Rank 2003 Rank 2002 Rank 1995 Rank 1992 Rank 1989 Rank 1985 Rank 1983 Rank 1978 readying the technology to launch the next generation to more long-term or basic research-oriented goals. This process shifted again in the late 1990s as the Japanese firms found themselves behind the Koreans and Taiwanese in memory and fabrication technology and unable to match the U.S. companies in the heavily design-and market-oriented logic areas. Recent research consortia such as ASPLA, ASUKA, and others have attempted to remedy this situation. Third, many companies in the Japanese semiconductor industry, especially the sogo denki makers, were connected not only downstream to various electronics markets, but also upstream to various semiconductor equipment companies through the innovation envelope. These relationships could be as wholly owned subsidiaries or as in-house production units, but more often than not they were the equity relationships known as vertical keiretsu (\"business group\"). The impact of these upstream linkages with equipment companies was important in the early years because they enabled the Japanese semiconductor companies to catch up and then surpass their U.S. counterparts in fabrication process technology (Meth\u00e9, 1985 (Meth\u00e9, , 1991a . The relationship between the equipment companies and the semiconductor companies was tighter than in the U.S. or European cases and was relation-based that is, based on long-term mutual commitments to codevelop fabrication technology and refine it for the primary contractor. The character of this relationship shifted from facilitator to inhibitor as the context of the semiconductor industry began to change around the end of the decade of the 1980s and early 1990s.",

One outcome of the bipolar competition between the U.S. and Japan was the creation of SEMATECH, which worked to advance and standardize fabrication process technology, thus diffusing advanced process technology more rapidly out into the industry.

Further, as Japanese semiconductor companies lost momentum in the DRAM segment of the semiconductor industry to the new Korean competitors, their ability to fund the increasing demand for capital needed for new equipment faltered. This started to drive the Japanese equipment manufacturers to search for new customers. The Achilles' heel of Japanese electronics firms in general has always been in the area of software development and systems integration. With the growing importance of software-controlled fabrication equipment, the Japanese equipment makers were at a disadvantage, and one that could not be compensated for by the sharing of information with Japanese semiconductor firms, which were equally as deficient.

The Plaza Accord raised the value of the yen substantially against the dollar. This agreement between the Japanese government and the other OECD member governments was not aimed specifically at the semiconductor industry, but it had an impact on it nevertheless. We will discuss the Korean semiconductor industry more fully below, but the Plaza Accord opened the door for the Koreans to come in with lower priced DRAMs, in dollar terms, than the Japanese. The 1985 Plaza Accord put an effective floor under the price of Japanese DRAMs relative to Korean and U.S. companies. The heavy dependence of Japanese semiconductor companies on DRAMs for much of their revenue as well as volume placed a considerable burden on them in terms of financing the further development of new processing technology. This burden was magnified by the slowdown in the growth of the Japanese economy overall after the bursting of the \"Economic Bubble\" in 1990 and in the slowdown in consumer electronics within Japan.",

The sogo denki system house form, as represented by NEC, Hi-tachi, Toshiba, and Mitsubishi Electric, began to withdraw from segments of the semiconductor industry, such as DRAMs. Hitachi and NEC created a joint venture for their DRAM operations called Elpida, which later absorbed the DRAM operation of Mitsubishi. Toshiba sold off its DRAM operation to Micron, a U.S. IDM. NEC further streamlined its semiconductor operations by spinning off its logic device operation as NEC Electronics in November 2002. NEC Electronics went public in July of 2003, although NEC is still the largest single shareholder after the initial public offering (IPO). This accounts for the system house shifting to the IDM designation as its organizational form in Table 4 .4. The same can be said for Renesas, the joint venture for logic devices that is a combination of Hitachi's and Mitsubishi Electric's logic operations. Currently, Hitachi has 55% of the equity and Mitsubishi Electric 45%. Renesas has yet to have its IPO, but one is planned. These two firms, NEC Electronics and Renesas, are concentrating much of their efforts on what has become the system-on-a-chip (SoC) segment of the semiconductor industry, an outgrowth of the older ASIC segment. This trend of shifting to an IDM organizational form with a focus on the SoC will most likely continue as companies like Fujitsu, Toshiba, Matsushita, Sony, and other system house firms that made semiconductors continue to have difficulties competing in the market. It remains to be seen if this strategic approach will be successful or not. As noted above, the Japanese electronics firms have had problems in developing their capabilities in software development and engineering. This is particularly troubling because success in the SoC segment requires, among other capabilities, sophisticated software engineering for embedding the software on the chip itself.",

As a result of the barren environment in terms of human, financial, and other resources necessary for entrepreneurial start-ups to begin and grow, few such start-ups have entered the Japanese market (Meth\u00e9, 2005; Meth\u00e9 and Bracker, 1994; Bracker and Meth\u00e9, 1994) . This lack of start-up organizational form support is deeply ingrained in the Japanese economic system and has inhibited the birth and growth of even the fabless organizational form. It should be remembered that this form originated in the U.S. as a counter to the high cost of entering with a fabrication facility. There have been no foundry start-ups either. Some of the system house forms have diversified into foundry operations, however. The alliance in 2000 between Hitachi and UMC in creating Tricenti was such a diversification. This alliance ended in 2002, however, because Hitachi bought out its UMC partner and later transferred the Tricenti operations to Renesas in 2003. Renesas has closed down the foundry operation, converting it into a leading-edge production fab for Renesas. 6 Anam Industrial, one of the Korean chaebol (large industrial group), initiated the Korean semiconductor industry with the development of contract services in 1968. Through its connections with Amkor, a U.S. firm that still offers services in the area of packaging and testing, Anam Industrial began offering assembly and testing services in Korea. Throughout the 1970s and into the 1980s, both Anam and Amkor did much of the spadework to promote the front end, or fabrication process, and the back end, or assembly and test process, in Korea. In the 1980s, European and U.S. firms partly in response to the challenge coming from Japanese producers availed themselves of the lower labor costs and skilled and increasingly knowledgeable engineering talent in Korea (Kim, 1997) . However, the Korean semiconductor industry did not really begin to take off on its own until the early to late 1970s as the government set semiconductor technology as one of the key areas for future growth.",

The role of the Korean government became an issue with Hynix as well because the company was hit with 57% tariffs by the U.S. for receiving subsidies from the Korean government. These subsidies kept the company afloat during 2001 and 2002 by allowing Hynix to sell its DRAMs below cost.",

Knowledge and skills were gained because of the industry's globalization through the flow of people and equipment. Further the bipolar axis of the industry between the U.S. and Japan during much of the 1980s opened up opportunities for the diversifying Korean entrants to gain access to knowledge from both contenders. Second, as noted above, the broader institutional factor of the Plaza Accord in 1985 created a price floor below which the Japanese producers of DRAMs could not go. This allowed the Korean suppliers of DRAMs to compete on price at a time when they were still untested as suppliers of this important commodity device. Third, the institutional latecomer environment clearly shaped the size of the Korean industry and the organizational forms that were able to enter. The diversifying system house organizational form dominated from the industry's inception and throughout the 1980s and 1990s.",

The DRAM industry is a commodity industry and one that is subject to business as well as silicon cycle fluctuations. Furthermore, the drive of the Korean semiconductor companies to outperform the Japanese led them to invest in capacity beyond what would have been economically feasible had the institutional support of the Korean government not been available. As a result, the overcapacity created by the Korean manufacturers and their over-reliance on DRAMs has also led to their being hurt more than others when this industry turns down. Some fabless design houses and IDM organizational form companies have entered in non-memory areas, especially in the middle to late 1990s as the Korean government has attempted to open up the economy to more domestic competition, but none of these firms has achieved any significant global market presence as yet.",

Their number is not great, but several of these firms adopting the fabless organizational form have entered since the middle to late 1990s. It is too early to tell if these firms will have a measurable impact on the semi-conductor industry in Korea, but they are indicative of the techno-global dynamics of innovation driving the integrated-circuit industry. 7 The Taiwanese semiconductor industry is also a true latecomer to the global semiconductor industry, but its story, though bearing some resemblance to the Korean one, is remarkably different (Hu, 1997) . As a latecomer, it features the same agents, or players, but they are configured differently. The regular players were the government, indigenous companies, emigrants returning from the U.S., foreign semiconductor companies, and foreign semiconductor equipment companies. The beginnings of the semiconductor industry in Taiwan go back to action taken by the Taiwanese government in setting up the Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI) in 1971. Concern for electronics first manifested itself within the ITRI organization with the establishment of the Electronics Research Service Organization (ERSO). The activities within ERSO resulted in the spinout of the United Microelectronics Corporation (UMC) in 1979. This event set the difference in tone between Taiwanese semiconductor industry efforts and those of either Japan or Korea.",

In 1987 another company was spun out of ITRI, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC). As noted in a previous section, this company had financial support that was about equally divided among the Taiwanese government, Philips, and private investors. TSMC was the first pure foundry start-up in the world.

TI set up a joint venture with Acer called TI-Acer in 1989 and Mitsubishi Electric set one up with Taiwan's Umax-Elite Group called Powerchip Semiconductor in 1994. Another, ProMOS Technologies, was initially a joint venture between an existing Taiwanese semiconductor company, Mosel-Vitelic, and Infineon.

The variety of organizational forms entering and moving into the top listing of semiconductor companies in the Taiwan semiconductor industry is seen in only one other region, the United States. In some respects the Taiwanese industry is dominated more by the IDM and fabless/foundry start-up organizational forms than is any other region, including the U.S. Several trends can be seen in this latecomer to the semiconductor industry. First, although the role of government was important in the formative years of developing a critical mass of semiconductor-related technology and knowledge, this role changed in terms of how that knowledge was diffused. The government chose to spin out companies as venture operations and then basically withdrew. Market forces were allowed to shape the development of the semiconductor industry in Taiwan. This is not to say that the Taiwanese government plays no continuing role in the semiconductor industry. This role, however, is not the direct role of subsidies and funding, but of tax incentives and the education of engineering and managerial talent. The Taiwanese government has not directly stepped in to rescue a failing company.",

By the time the larger industrial groups, such as Formosa Plastics, took an interest in the semiconductor industry, the IDM and fabless/foundry start-up organizational forms had become well established and difficult to dislodge. Part of the answer may lie in the fact that UMC began essentially as a proving ground for whether semiconductor technology could take root in Taiwan. Much of the technology was imported from the U.S., and many of the people at UMC had had some experience working in the U.S. semiconductor industry. In the early 1980s the semiconductor industry was a risky place for companies that were engaged in relatively simple electronic systems assembly. The investments and the skills and people resources needed were not readily available, and profits could be made by further investment in electronic systems operations.",

The 1987 founding of TSMC using the pure foundry organizational form set in motion forces that have affected both the Taiwan semiconductor industry and the world semiconductor industry. By legitimizing the fabless design house strategy, the yoke of everincreasing capital investment was lifted from the neck of any engineer who had an idea for a new semiconductor device. This has opened up more opportunities for latecomers and mature countries alike if they have the institutional environment to support such entrepreneurial activities.

The silicon cycle of boom, overinvestment, bust, and underinvestment followed by a new boom has been repeated throughout each downturn. In the semiconductor industry of the periods throughout 1970 1990, memory and logic market segments were complementarily linked. Semiconductor companies focused on either logic or memory or both, and each used an IDM format even if the company itself was part of a system house. That is, all semiconductor operations were integrated to include design through fabrication and sales. If one company had a difficult time or even if the entire industry was confronted with an economic downturn, the fortunes of individual companies varied. The linking of many previously separated market segments occurs through the fabless/foundry nexus. From about the 1990s through the present, the global semiconductor industry has gone through another series of downturns that have been far more devastating in terms of their troughs than previous cycles and that have occurred closer together.

Reinforcing the trend begun in Korea, the existence of another market outside the U.S. Japan axis has freed up equipment companies to compete more on technical and market merit that emphasizes clear and transparent adherence to standards than on a customized approach that depends on intense company-to-company interaction. Although the Taiwanese semiconductor industry supports both indigenous and foreign equipment companies, the leading companies are still either Japan-or U.S.based semiconductor equipment companies.

The post-SEMATECH era, as that organization has transitioned into International SE-MATECH or ISEMATECH, is also a marker for a shift in government policy away from direct involvement in integrated-circuit technology innovation processes. This pattern of changes appears among the Japanese institutions and agents. The period beginning in the 1970s and culminating in the establishment of the VLSI Research Cooperative in the early 1980s marked a time when the Japanese government was actively exerting influence on the techno-global forces driving the innovation process in the integrated-circuit industry. During the later 1980s and into the 1990s the Japanese government had withdrawn from such active participation in the process. With the reemergence of research cooperatives such as SELETE, ASPLA, ASUKA and others, an attempt is being made to duplicate the pattern exhibited earlier with the hope that government involvement will again create conditions conducive to a Japanese semiconductor industry re-birth.

Alliances among firms through the sharing of financial and technological resources are common both within and between institutional regimens. Systematically organized alliances, as seen in research consortia in the early decades of the development of the semiconductor industry, were more likely to be limited to firms within an institutional regimen, such as the VLSI Research Cooperative in Japan, SEMATECH in the U.S., ESPRIT and BRITE in Europe, and the fourth five-year plan in Korea as well as its successor, the HAN project (Meth\u00e9, 1995b) .

As illustrated by the more open membership rules of the Hsinchu Science Park, IMEC in Europe, and ISEMATECH in the U.S., participation by international companies may now be a prerequisite for the success of these nationalbase institutional initiatives.

Likewise the earlier consortia were limited, either by design or by accident, to specific organizational forms, mostly system house IC organizational forms and some IDMs. The more recent cooperative endeavors are more open to various types of organizational forms.

The effect of institutional forces on the composition of the firms comprising each country's integratedcircuit industry is readily apparent. Although the contrasts among the U.S., Europe, and Japan are stark enough, the disparity between the two latecomer countries, Korea and Taiwan, is profound in illustrating how differences in the configuration of players and policies can result in a differing mix of organizational forms at the time of the founding of the industry in each country.",

Established system houses diversifying into the IC industry were chosen for Korea, and IDM start-ups were chosen for Taiwan. The initial mix of organizational forms could not have been more different. We have also found that the oldest organizational form, the diversifying electronic systems house, has had remarkable staying power. Although individual firms may have come and gone, the organizational form itself has lasted throughout the entire history of the semiconductor industry and has existed within each country's local institutional context. We have further found that the techno-global forces at work are pushing the global semiconductor industry into a new set of dominating organizational forms.",

This is particularly evident in the U.S. and Taiwanese integrated-circuit industries, but is also becoming apparent in the European, Japanese, and Korean industries. First, it is important to point out that some firms will most likely continue with a system house organizational form. In the U.S., IBM appears to be continuing to use this form. In Europe, Philips has continued to keep its integrated-circuit operations closely tied to its systems operations. The same appears to be so with Samsung in Korea. There are strong technological and economic reasons for linking system house and IC operations in one organizational form. Astute management can capture potential economies of scale and scope and can focus research and development efforts to take advantage of both a large internal market as well as the external merchant market.",

Instead, the system house organizational form is declining through the strategic choice of the firms that had adopted it in the first place. Many system houses are spinning out their semiconductor operations to become more standalone companies, albeit with some equity connection back to the parent company. The actions in Japan of Hitachi and NEC in forming Elpida, of Hitachi and Mitsubishi Electric in forming Renesas, and of NEC Electronics and Elpida in becoming more freestanding companies within the NEC group are one set of illustrations of the developing IDM organizational form. In Europe the creation of Infineon and STMicro are also examples of spinouts from system houses of their integrated-circuit operations. The same can be said of Hynix within the Hyundai group; it is more independent than its predecessor Hyundai Electronics was. The same techno-global driving forces are also at work in the move of Motorola to spin out its semiconductor operations into an independent company.",

Moreover, the focused strategy of the IDM organizational form may be easier to manage, in tracking both the upswings and the downturns of sales and profit performance in semiconductors, than the more broad-based system house form. However, strategic choices by managers using the IDM form may make the IDM form more of a blended form itself. Many IDM companies are beginning to reduce their commitment to the fabrication aspect of semiconductor technology. Even firms newly adopting the IDM organizational form, like Motorola, NEC Electronics, Elpida, and others, regardless of their country of origin, as well as some system house forms like Philips, are beginning to adopt a \"fablite\" strategy. With the fab-lite strategy, the IDM company devotes some human and financial resources to fabrication technology, but it also begins to rely on the dedicated foundry companies such as UMC and TSMC. IDM companies that adopt this strategic approach may eventually evolve into a collection of fabless design houses under one company name as each of their various IC divisions sheds its fabrication capability and relies on dedicated foundries for production. Or each division may be spun out as a separate fabless company. It remains to be seen if this strategy will be lasting and what direction it will take, but the techno-global forces of increasing resource needs for each succeeding semiconductor generation and the worldwide diffusion of fabrication skills are driving it.",

            "text": "From discussions with senior managerial and engineering personnel at many companies mentioned in this report, it appears that a consensus is forming around the belief that the fabless organizational form is the wave of the future. We have seen that it has been in existence since the late 1960s and came into prominence as a preferred mode of entry in the early 1980s. Its growing importance as a mode of entry emerged in response to certain features of the technoglobal innovation dynamics driving the integrated-circuit industry. The emergence of the dedicated foundry legitimized the fabless organizational form. The combination of these two organizational forms into a symbiotic link could be considered a new organizational form in its own right. Whether considered so or not, the fabless/foundry nexus has had a growing impact on the integratedcircuit industry, as is evident from the emergence of TSMC into the global top 10 in 2002 8 . It should be noted, however, that no fabless firm by itself has yet entered the global top 10 semiconductor firms. Some, such as Nvidia and Qualcomm, have entered the top 10 semiconductor producers in the U.S., and there are also VIA and ProMOS among the top 10 companies in the Taiwanese semiconductor industry. It is possible and in fact very likely that some firm that has adopted the fabless organizational form will enter the global semiconductor industry's top 10 rankings. Given the relatively narrower customer focus adopted by these firms, however, the fabless form is by no means the most likely organizational form to have the organizational resources necessary to dominate over the IDM form. It is also an open question whether the new entries into the semiconductor industry from China using the dedicated foundry organizational form will be as successful as the initial firms that adopted that form. The level of concentration of foundry services has been about 80% for the top 3 firms. However, it does appear that the dedicated foundry organizational form, along with its symbiotic partner, the fabless organizational form, is a legitimate form within the global semiconductor industry and one that will not disappear soon.",

It does appear, however, to finally be on its way out of the global industry, at least as a dominant form occupying the center of the industry.

As we observed, all the various organizational forms including the fabless form and then the dedicated foundry form had entered by the 1980s. No new organizational forms have emerged from the techno-global dynamics of the industry since the 1980s. It is possible that after more than 40 years of existence, the techno-global dynamics of the semiconductor industry have entered or are entering a period of maturation of the technological and globalization forces that have given birth to these various organizational forms. The exiting of the system house organizational form from the industry may also be an indicator of this passage into a more mature phase of development. It is quite clear that the competitive dynamics that result in the turnover of individual firms will continue, however. The strategic adjustment by integrated-circuit firms using the system house organizational form to move to an IDM form, and by those firms using the IDM form to move to a \"fab-lite\" strategy, is indicative of the ability of incumbents to sustain their positions in the industry. Strategic choices, both in terms of the organizational form adopted during entry into the semiconductor industry and in terms of the changes that managers make to that organizational form, are important transmission mechanisms for selection and adaptation to the techno-global and institutional forces at work in the semiconductor industry.",

            "text": "This study has also shed some light on the processes of change and continuity in an industry that is considered a technology-intensive industry and thus one that is characterized by a volatile environment. We do not dispute the characterization of the semiconductor industry's environment as volatile. It has undergone many recessions, several quite severe, as well as many technological changes both in underlying technology and in product classes, such as DRAMs and MPUs. It is important to note that some changes, such as the development of the semiconductor and the integrated-circuit themselves, were radical (doubleloop or heterodynamic changes) and that others, such as the movement along the integrated-circuit technology trajectory, were more moderate and predictable (single-loop or homeostatic changes). Although the radical changes did open up the industry to many new entrants, they did not open it up to many new organizational forms. The commercialization of semiconductor technology resulted in the first two types of organizational form, the system house and the IDM, but it was the more routine technology progression along the IC innovation envelope that created the conditions for the development of the fabless and dedicated foundry types of organizational form. It appears that single-loop change at one level of the system resulted in double-loop change at another level of the system. Likewise, the diminution in the number of firms holding to the system house organizational form in recent years does not appear to be the result of fundamental or double-loop technological change. The tremendous decline in the market that occurred in 2001 does seem to have hastened the decline of the system house form, but it does not appear to have initiated it. The dynamics of the techno-global and institutional forces at work in the semiconductor industry have created an intricate nested system of relationships. We have explored some aspects of those relationships, and it is hoped that this study will stimulate and inform discussions on these important issues. It is obvious, but still needs saying, that further study is warranted in order to develop a deeper understanding of the processes described in this work.",
