With an ongoing spread worldwide and increasing mortality, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is now a pandemic and public health emergency of international concern as per the World Health Organization.[1] As of April 24th, the total number of reported cases of COVID-19 globally has been 2.79 million of which 923, 000 have been in the United States. The clinical presentation of this disease is mostly pulmonary, with computed tomography of chest contributing to the diagnosis and facilitating the staging and severity of the disease.[2,3] Reports of cardiac manifestations of COVID-19 infection are on the rise[4,5]. In this review, we discuss the various cardiovascular manifestations of this disease. We have aimed to discuss in detail the pathophysiology, cardiovascular manifestations of the infection, and a concise review of articles published with data from the present pandemic.",

The study including 90 patients who underwent non contrast computed tomography (CT) of chest reported pericardial effusion in 1% of patients.[23] In this study, the authors also reported that in more than 70% of patients there was evidence of disease progression on the subsequent CT. However, Wu et al in their study did not find this trend or appearance of a new pericardial effusion at follow up imaging done within 6 days.[22] Another study reported around 4-5% of patients with pericardial effusion. In this study Li et al reported that the presence of pericardial effusion was significantly higher among patients with severe disease, indicating the presence of significantly higher inflammation.[3,24]. The same has been demonstrated in autopsy showing pericarditis in patients.[25] There are isolated case reports of pericardial effusion being documented on echocardiography of COVID-19 patients.

Marked biventricular myocardial interstitial edema was noted in short tau inversion recovery and T2-mapping sequences. Diffuse late gadolinium enhancement extending to the biventricular wall was also noted in phase-sensitive inversion recovery sequences, fulfilling the criteria for acute myocarditis. Circumferential pericardial effusion was noted, extending to 12 mm around the right cardiac chambers.[30]\n",

A recent study including 22,000 COVID-19 patients from Italy, reported an overall mortality of 7.2%. Cardiovascular risk factors in terms of DM, ischemic heart disease, atrial fibrillation and a history of stroke was present in 35.5%, 30%, 24.5%, and 9.6% respectively in a subset of patients who succumbed to the disease. Advanced age was associated with higher mortality in this study with a reported case fatality of 12.8 % and 20.2% in patients above the age group of 70 and,80 respectively.[15] Across all studies, cardiovascular risk factors like advanced age, hypertension, DM, coronary artery disease, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, cerebrovascular disease have been reported to be associated with increased mortality. As shown in figure 2\n, these factors have been independently linked with higher disease severity, multi-organ failure, requirement of invasive and noninvasive mechanical ventilation, presence of cardiac injury, and mortality.[4,8,14,15,17,21]",
