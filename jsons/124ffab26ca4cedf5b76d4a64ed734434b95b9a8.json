The standard \"compartment\" models of the spread of disease through a population follow the law of mass action; that is, the rate of conversion of individuals from one compartment to another is directly proportional to the number of individuals in the former. The basic S-I-R model, which tracks susceptible, infectious, and recovered people, is functionally identical to autocatalytic reactions studied in chemical kinetics. However, if we account for heterogeneity in individuals' susceptibility to catch the disease, then the most susceptible individuals are likely to be removed from the pool early; this is analogous to evaporative cooling in chemical kinetics. Here, we use standard tools from statistical physics to account for this effect, which suggest that the rate of appearance of new cases should be proportional to the square of the number of susceptible people in the population, not the first power. We validate this finding with both Monte Carlo (stochastic) and many-compartment differential equation (deterministic) simulations. This leads to quite different predictions of the peak infection rate and final outbreak size, with the second-order model giving milder predictions of each. This has dramatic effects on the extrapolation of a disease's progression when the data collected comes from the early, exponential-like region, and may remove a systematic bias from such models. arXiv:2005.04704v1 [q-bio.PE] 10 May 2020",

The likelihood of infecting new people is considered to be continuously distributed in a population. 5 Although the reasons for variations in spreading are debated, it is clear that there must a mixture of behavioral attributes (such as the number of new people encountered by an individual in a typical day, density of their work environment, or personal hygiene habits) and inherent (such as genetic differences in immune system, age, etc.). Here, we hypothesize that if the likelihood to spread a disease follows a distribution in the population, then the likelihood to catch a disease shouldas a first assumption-follow a similar distribution. We can imagine that many of the same traits responsible for spreading (e.g., frequency of encountering new people, hygiene) apply to catching as well, while other inherent traits (e.g., immune system, 14 age, etc.) may drive variability in spreading and catching differently.",

Policymakers (ideally) take into consideration predictions of x * S to determine when the outbreak will begin to decline naturally, and thus when it is safe to loosen societal constraints, such as stay-at-home orders. The first-order and second-order models have different predictions for x * S : (\u03b2/\u03b3 is often referred to as R 0 , the basic reproduction number, in epidemiological reports. 2 ) These critical x * S 's are shown with dashed lines on the figure for both models.

This \"Boltzmann\" distribution allows us to use the tools of statistical physics to examine the consequences of this effect, leading to a very simple, yet consequential result: changing a first-order term to a second-order term. What happens if the distribution of susceptibilities in the population follows a different distribution? For a hint at possible distribution shapes we can examine those for disease spreaders. As mentioned earlier, in an examination of several diseases, the most infectious 20% of spreaders were found to be responsible for 45-90% of new infections; 5 under the exponential distribution, the top 20% of spreaders would be responsible for about 50% of new cases. Therefore, we can consider the exponential distribution to be on the conservative end of estimates. If the true initial distribution of susceptibility has a longer tail (that is, a greater proportion of highly-susceptible individuals) than the exponential distribution, this will make the effect more pronounced. That is, these very high-\u03b5 individuals will be disproportionately \"discovered\" at the beginning of the outbreak, putting even greater downward pressure on the average, before the dynamics of the process ultimately convert the distribution to a more exponential-like form. The effect of the initial distribution can readily be simulated with either the stochastic or binned deterministic The left plot shows the results of integrating a pure 1st-order and pure 2nd-order model as limiting cases, and compares integrating a first-order model with the population binned by susceptibility with an increasing number of bins. The binning structure is shown on the right; the height of the block indicates the population density of the bin, and the red dot indicates the mean of the bin used in the discrete model.",

First, this derivation does not assume any correlation between spreading propensity and infection susceptibility. Put simply: are some super-spreaders also super-catchers? If a positive correlation exists between super-spreaders and super-catchers, then the super-spreaders will be most active at the beginning of an outbreak and contribute disproportionately to the rate of infection, but as the outbreak progresses, they also will be disproportionately removed, causing a more downward pressure on the relative rate of infection. In contrast, if there is no correlation, then superspreaders pop up throughout the outbreak with a frequency identical to their prevalence in the population, and the average kinetics are unaffected. It seems plausible that many of the social traits that are found in superspreaders also would be common in super-catchers. We leave the mathematical analysis of this possible synergistic effect to future work, but if a positive correlation exists, we might consider the second-order behavior to be a lower bound on the kinetic effects of variation in population in the S-I-R model. On the other hand, an implicit assumption in our derivation is that individuals' susceptibilities are static quantities; that is, they do not significantly change with time. For example, if an individual changes their behavior patterns from one month to the next, they may go from having a low susceptibility to a high susceptibility. We leave the balance between these two counter-balancing factors to future works, but for now we consider the second-order model to be a reasonable approximation, and a significant deviation from the classic first-order model.",

After assigning an initial distribution of the population-that is, filling the bins, which as a first approximation we assigned as exponential-we next sampled from the above probability distribution. That is, we drew a random number and assigned it to one of the above categories based on its probability. Figure S-1 shows a snapshot of this Monte Carlo simulation for N =100,000 individuals divided into M =1000 bins. Initially, the bins were distributed according to an exponential distribution with mean susceptibility\u03b5=1. The bins were spaced such that each bin initially had 100 individuals in it; that is, bins on the right were wide and bins on the left were narrow. Samples were withdrawn from bins one-by-one according to the probability distribution above. This figure was made when 40,000 individuals had been removed from the pool of susceptible. The top-left plot shows a histogram of the current distribution of individuals according to their susceptibility, which we can see has remained exponential. The curve below this shows the draw probability, which is simply the population of each bin times the susceptibility \u03b5 of that bin. The top-right curve shows the average susceptibility\u03b5 of the susceptible pool; importantly, we see this decreasing in direct proportion to x S , as predicted by equation (S.4) . The curve below this shows the total susceptibility of the population over the course of the simulation, where we see second-order behavior emerge. Our Monte Carlo simulations were in excellent agreement with the equations derived in this work, which are shown in the figure with the curve marked \"theory\".",
