In 2018, Nimenrix\u00ae replaced the Hib-MenC vaccine at 12 months of age on the national immunisation program (NIP) and hence funded for eligible individuals. There may be some brand-specific immune interference with other vaccines: for example, Menactra\u00ae should not be co-administered with pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, but be given at least 4 weeks later, and administering tetanus, low-dose diphtheria and acellular pertussis (Tdap) vaccine 3\u20134 weeks after (not before) Nimenrix\u00ae has the advantage of an enhanced tetanus immunity.3",

There is considerable risk of pertussis among Hajj pilgrims.4 In Australia, Tdap vaccines are available free at age 10\u201315 years and for pregnant women from 28 weeks of gestation, and recommended for elderly adults if not received in the previous 10 years. Any pilgrim unsure of their Tdap vaccination status should get vaccinated. Hepatitis B risks at Hajj include sharing of razors to shave heads by men to mark the conclusion of Hajj. The NIP has a 4-dose schedule of hepatitis B at birth, 2, 4 and 6 months of age, but Australian-born adults and migrants may not be immunised, vaccination should be considered. Some Hajj pilgrims receive hepatitis A and typhoid vaccines, although the actual benefit remains unclear.",

It is important that Hajj pilgrims are aware of various health hazards; know about the availability of vaccines and other simple preventive measures (e.g. hand hygiene).
