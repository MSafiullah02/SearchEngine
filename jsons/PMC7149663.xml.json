            "text": "The interactions between a virus and its host cell play a central role in the viral infection cycle. The analysis of virus\u2013host interactions is critical for understanding the mechanisms of viral infections and for the development of novel antiviral strategies. Viruses are obligate intracellular pathogens with small genomes and, therefore, are reliant on subverting of the cellular functions and machineries to facilitate their own replication. The cell nucleus is one of the key features of eukaryotic cells. It is a highly dynamic, membrane-bound organelle that hosts major cellular events, including DNA replication, messenger RNA synthesis and processing, and ribosome subunit biogenesis (Trinkle-Mulcahy and Lamond, 2007). Given the pivotal role of the nucleus in cell host function, it is not surprising that viruses interact with this organelle and its compartments, and that such interactions play a crucial role in the virus infection cycle. Indeed, certain viruses including plant DNA containing begomoviruses (Rojas et al., 2001, Sharma & Ikegami, 2009), RNA reverse-transcribing caulimoviruses (CaMVs) (Haas et al., 2005), and negative-strand RNA rhabdoviruses belonging to the genus Nucleorhabdovirus (Tsai et al., 2005) replicate in the nucleus, and therefore it makes sense that these viruses modify nuclear structures to usurp some of the nuclear functions and provide an appropriate environment for their own replication. In contrast, single-stranded positive-sense RNA [(+)ssRNA] viruses replicate in the cytoplasm. Therefore, the rational for RNA viruses targeting the nucleus and its compartments is not so evident. However, an increasing number of reports clearly show that cytoplasmic RNA viruses including plant viruses can also target nuclear compartments and, nucleoli, in particular (reviewed by Hiscox, 2002, Hiscox, 2007, Greco, 2009). Thus, investigating why and how plant RNA viruses interact with the nucleolus to meet their own needs will contribute to the better understanding of molecular biology of plant viruses and facilitate the design of novel strategies for virus control. These studies may also teach us about the fundamental principles of plant nucleolar structure and functions.",

Indeed, for many years the exclusive function of the nucleolus was thought to be rRNA synthesis and ribosome biogenesis. However, several insights from the past decade have dramatically changed this traditional view and implicated the nucleolus in many other aspects of cell function such as cell-cycle regulation, gene silencing, telomerase activity, senescence, stress responses, and biogenesis of multiple ribonucleoprotein (RNP) particles (Boisvert et al., 2007, Olson & Dundr, 2005, Sirri et al., 2008).",

Most of the current knowledge on nucleolar localization and functions of viral proteins has been gained in studies on animal viruses and has also been reviewed comprehensively (Greco, 2009, Hiscox, 2002, Hiscox, 2007). Therefore, the main emphasis of this review will be on what is known about the different aspects of interactions between plant virus proteins and the nucleolus, of which the functional significance in control of virus movement and interference with host antiviral defense has started to appear only recently. We also discuss recent findings on the potential role of Cajal bodies (CBs), another type of small subnuclear bodies structurally and functionally associated with the nucleolus.",

The nucleus contains chromatin-rich regions, made up of condensed heterochromatin, more dispersed euchromatin, and interchromatin regions, and chromatin organization is responsible for regulating gene expression, DNA replication, and chromosome segregation (Schneider & Grosscheld, 2007, Trinkle-Mulcahy & Lamond, 2008). In addition, it contains many other structures or bodies of different numbers and sizes which vary between cell types, at different stages in the cell cycle and under different conditions. The most prominent of these structures is the nucleolus but many other bodies [e.g., CBs, splicing speckles, paraspeckles, PML (pro-myeloid leukemia) bodies, etc.] have now been identified and are being characterized on the basis of their protein and RNA components and functions (Boisvert et al., 2007, Cioce & Lamond, 2005, Lamond & Spector, 2003, Matera et al., 2009, Rippe, 2007).",

The nucleolus contains three different regions on the basis of their appearance in the transmission electron microscope: fibrillar centers (FC), the dense fibrillar component (DFC), and the granular component (GC). In the mammalian nucleolus, the FCs are small, lightly staining structures surrounded by the more densely stained DFC. The DFC in turn is surrounded a particulate region\u2014the GC. The plant nucleolus tends to be more regular in its structure (usually near to spherical) than animal nucleoli. The organization of the nucleolar regions is different in plant nucleoli in that the DFC is not as densely stained as in animal nucleoli and occupies much more of the nucleolar volume (up to 70%). Transcription of precursor rRNAs (pre-rRNAs) occurs at multiple sites (200\u2013400) within the DFC regions and pre-rRNAs undergo processing in the DFC and GC. Indeed, the localization of pre-rRNAs and different small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) and proteins has allowed early and late pre-rRNA cleavage events to be correlated to the DFC and GC, respectively, suggesting a vectorial model for the production and maturation of rRNAs. Plant nucleoli also often contain a prominent central region called the nucleolar cavity (Brown & Shaw, 1998, Shaw & Brown, 2004). The function of the nucleolar cavity is currently unknown, and it remains to be seen whether the differences in organization of plant and animal nucleoli influence the type and range of other functions which nucleoli carry out and interactions with different viruses.",

The dynamic assembly pathway involves a series of intermediate pre-ribosomal complexes of the 40S and 60S ribosomal subunits and in addition to ribosomal proteins, requires up to 200 accessory proteins (Grannemann and Baserga, 2004). Processing of the pre-rRNAs involves both cleavage of the precursor transcript and nucleotide modifications, the majority of which are 2\u2032-O-ribose methylation and pseudouridylation. Some cleavage reactions and the modifications require snoRNPs. SnoRNPs consist of a snoRNA and associated proteins (Kiss, 2002). By the nature of the major function in rRNA production and ribosomal subunit assembly, there is a huge flux of proteins and RNA complexes into and out of the nucleolus. The highly dynamic movement of proteins and complexes has been illustrated in animal cells by quantitative nucleolar proteomic analyses (Andersen et al., 2005, Lam et al., 2007). In particular, ribosomal proteins are highly expressed and rapidly accumulate in the nucleolus where they are incorporated into ribosomal subunits or rapidly degraded (Lam et al., 2007).",

Fibrillarin, one of the major proteins of the nucleolus, is a core component of box C/D snoRNPs and is required for rRNA processing (Venema and Tollervey, 1999). Fibrillarin has methyltransferase activity directing 2\u2032-O-ribose methylation of rRNA (Barneche et al., 2000, Cioce & Lamond, 2005, Matera & Shpargel, 2006). Fibrillarin is highly conserved in sequence, structure, and function in eukaryotes. The N-terminal region of fibrillarin comprises a glycine- and arginine-rich (GAR) domain (Barneche et al., 2000). The GAR domain is methylated at arginine residues (Liu and Dreyfuss, 1995) and is responsible for interactions with various proteins including the survival motor neuron (SMN) gene product (Jones et al., 2001) and the nuclear DEAD (Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp) box protein p68 (Nicol et al., 2000). Fibrillarin contains a centrally located RNA-binding domain which together with the C-terminal helix domain and the intervening spacer constitutes a methyltransferase-like domain that contains an S-adenosyl methionine binding motif and is responsible for fibrillarin methyltransferase activity (Wang et al., 2000a, Wang et al., 2000b). The C-terminal helix domain appears to target fibrillarin to CBs (Snaar et al., 2000). Although it is well established that fibrillarin plays a role in ribosome biogenesis within the nucleolus, its role in CBs is not well understood but it is presumably responsible for the 2\u2032-O-ribose methylation of small nuclear RNAs (snRNAs).",

The structure of NoLSs is not well defined and depends on different factors including whether the protein associates with another nucleolar-bound protein or alternatively traffics to the nucleolus on its own or associates with RNA transcripts that are being transcribed in the nucleolus. At least in some cases, NoLS are rich in arginine and lysine residues and can overlap with NLSs (Hiscox, 2002, Hiscox, 2007).",

As mentioned above, spliceosomal snRNAs are also modified and contain 2\u2032-O-ribose methylations and pseudouridines. Modification of nucleotides in snRNAs is guided by small CB-specific RNAs (scaRNAs) (Darzacq et al., 2002, Jady et al., 2003). A major component of CBs is the protein, coilin, which is required for their formation. In plants, mutants are available which knock out CBs or alter their size and number, two of which are due to mutations in coilin (Collier et al., 2006). The number of CBs per nucleus can vary in different cell types and is under developmental control (Cioce and Lamond, 2005).",

For example, the nucleolus has a role in the maturation, assembly, and export of RNP particles. The signal recognition particle (SRP) has a nucleolar phase in its assembly with particular protein constituents of the SRP being localized to the nucleolus. Similarly, telomerase RNP, required for chromosome replication, may be assembled in the nucleolus, and the nucleolus may also have a role in sequestering telomerase RNP to avoid inappropriate nucleation of telomere structures. Spliceosomal snRNPs may also undergo part of their assembly in the nucleolus, and processing of pre-tRNAs and U6snRNA occurs in the nucleolus. In addition, the nucleolus is a site of sequestration of particular proteins to regulate, for example, the cell cycle or cell death, and acts as a sensor of cellular stress (Boisvert et al., 2007, Olson, 2004, Pedersen, 1998, Ra\u0161ka et al., 2006, Rubbi & Milner, 2003).",

Initial proteomic analyses of human cells identified a few hundred proteins which included not only well-known nucleolar proteins such as ribosomal proteins, fibrillarin, nucleolin, B23, etc. but also, for example, splicing and translation factors (Andersen et al., 2002). Advances in proteomics has now allowed the identification of around 4500 proteins in the human nucleolar proteome (Ahmad et al., 2008) and the dynamic behavior of nucleolar components and complexes can now be determined (Andersen et al., 2005, Lam et al., 2007). In plants, a partial proteomic analysis of the nucleolus identified many expected ribosomal and nucleolar proteins but also found splicing and translation factors (Pendle et al., 2005). In particular, exon junction complex proteins (associated with mRNAs following splicing) were identified in the nucleolar proteome and in the nucleolus by fluorescence microscopy (Pendle et al., 2005). One of these proteins, eIF4A-III, a core protein of the exon junction complex, was shown to redistribute from the nucleoplasm to the nucleolus and finally to splicing speckles under stress conditions of hypoxia (Koroleva et al., 2009). Similar dynamic distribution, involving the nucleolus, of proteins that interact with mRNAs has been demonstrated and the nucleolus and CBs have been shown to be involved in U1snRNP production in plants (Lorkovi\u0107 & Barta, 2008, Tillemans et al., 2006).",

            "text": "In plants, novel functions for the plant nucleolus, CBs, and another largely nucleolar-associated body, the D-body, have been described. Firstly, the production of heterochromatic siRNAs, which are involved in transcriptional silencing, is thought to occur in a region of the nucleolus or in D bodies due to the localization of protein components of the machinery and of siRNAs (Pontes and Pikaard, 2008). Secondly, maturation of microRNAs (miRNAs) may occur in D-bodies as precursor miRNAs as well as Dicer-like ribonuclease 1 (DCL1) have been located to these structures (Pontes and Pikaard, 2008). Similarly, in mammalian cells, some precursor and mature miRNAs have recently been found in the nucleus with some being enriched in the nucleolus (Politz et al., 2009, Scott et al., 2009). Of particular interest was the enrichment of some precursors in the GC suggesting that miRNA processing could occur in the nucleolus, or these miRNAs may be involved in ribosome synthesis or other nucleolar functions (Politz et al., 2009). The link between the nucleolus and miRNA production is illustrated by the evolutionary relationship between some snoRNAs and miRNA precursors. For example, a human snoRNA was shown to be processed by Dicer to generate small RNAs which were associated with argonaute proteins (AGOs) and caused reduced expression of gene targets (Ender et al., 2008). In addition, numerous snoRNA-derived small RNAs from different organisms (including Arabidopsis) were associated with components of RNA silencing pathways (Taft et al., 2009) and many miRNA precursors have retained snoRNA features (Scott et al., 2009). Finally, a third novel function for the plant nucleolus is in mRNA biogenesis, surveillance, or nonsense-mediated decay (NMD). Biochemical fractionation of nucleoplasm and nucleoli and subsequent sequencing of isolated cDNAs have shown that the plant nucleolus not only contains mRNAs but that aberrant mRNAs are enriched in the nucleolus (Kim et al., 2009). The aberrant mRNAs show splicing defects, the majority of which would introduce premature termination codons and therefore be expected to be substrates for NMD. Using upf mutants (affected UPF proteins, key components of the NMD mechanism), the correlation between enrichment of aberrant mRNAs in the nucleolus and turnover by NMD was corroborated and was further supported by the localization of the NMD proteins, UPF2 and UPF3, to the nucleolus (Kim et al., 2009).",

The nucleolus has also been associated with mRNA export on the basis of accumulation of polyA+ RNA upon disruption of export factors, nucleolar structure, or stress conditions in yeast and animal cells, although this could reflect increased polyadenylation prior to degradation (Ideue et al., 2004, Olson, 2004, Schneiter et al., 1995). More recently, the nucleolus has been proposed to be involved in the formation of mRNPs which are localized to specific regions of the cytoplasm for translation. In yeast, ASH1 mRNA enters the nucleolus bound to specific RNA-binding proteins at which time translation repressor proteins are loaded onto the mRNA. The mRNP is then exported to the cytoplasm, transported to its final destination, and then translation is activated (Du et al., 2008, Jellbauer & Jansen, 2008). A similar trafficking pathway may also operate in mammals for mRNPs associated with the nucleolar protein, Staufen, which is involved in transport of mRNAs in neurons (Jellbauer and Jansen, 2008).",

It contains many RNA-interacting proteins involved in these processes, including highly abundant RNA-binding proteins (such as fibrillarin and nucleolin) involved in rRNA and ribosomal subunit production. It is therefore a dynamic hub of RNA processing activity, RNA:protein interaction and complex formation. These characteristics, in addition to the potential involvement of the nucleolus in mRNA biogenesis and, particularly, the transport of mRNAs and mRNPs to and from the nucleolus to other parts of the cell, make the nucleolus a prime target for exploitation by viruses. It is therefore not surprising that viruses have taken advantage of the nucleolus and nucleolar components for production and distribution of viral RNAs and RNPs.",

Interestingly, B23 has been shown to stimulate adenovirus replication. RNA virus replication may also be facilitated by nucleolar proteins. Indeed, the HDAg protein encoded by hepatitis delta virus (a (\u2212)ssRNA virus which is a subviral satellite of the DNA virus, hepatitis B virus) also binds to nucleolin and B23. It has been proposed that HDAg interacts with both these proteins in a complex that promotes viral RNA replication, presumably as a result of the helicase activity of nucleolin (Huang et al., 2001).",

Poliovirus is also able to interact with nucleolin causing its selective redistribution from the nucleolus to the cytoplasm (Waggoner and Sarnow, 1998). After relocalization, nucleolin binds to the internal ribosome entry sites (IRESs) at the 5\u2032 untranslated region of poliovirus genomic RNA, and this interaction stimulates IRES-dependent translation (Hellen and Sarnow, 2001). This also occurs in hepatitis C virus (Izumi et al., 2001) and represents an alternative translation initiation strategy as compared to the classical eukaryotic Cap-dependent translation (Hellen and Sarnow, 2001). Nucleolin is also able to interact with the 3\u2032-untranslated region of poliovirus RNA, which controls synthesis of negative strand RNA (Waggoner and Sarnow, 1998). Interaction of picornaviruses with the nucleolus could also down-regulate host gene expression. For example, the human rhinovirus 3C protease precursors that are localized in the nucleolus at early stages of the infection inhibit cellular RNA by cleavage of vital transcription factors (Amineva et al., 2004).",

For instance, by altering the distribution of fibrillarin, viruses might be reducing polI transcription, that is, the synthesis of rRNA, as blocking fibrillarin with antibody prevented its translocation to nucleoli and resulted in the reduction or inhibition of polI transcription (Fomproix et al., 1998).

Before nuclear export, HIV RNA passes through the nucleolus. Rev binds to a cis-acting RNA element (Rev-response element), which is found in all unspliced and incompletely spliced viral mRNAs, and this promotes the translocation of these RNAs from the nucleus (Cant\u00f3-Nogu\u00e9s et al., 2001, Michienzi et al., 2000).

Alternatively, they use nucleolar functions for their own benefit. Recruitment of nucleolar proteins is especially beneficial for viruses, and in particular for RNA containing viruses, as these proteins possess many crucial functions in cellular RNA biosynthesis, processing, translation, and trafficking. Indeed, during virus infections of mammalian cells, various viral components traffic to and from the nucleolus where they interact with different host factors. Certain nucleolar proteins are redistributed into other cell compartments or are modified, and some cellular proteins are relocalized in the nucleolus of infected cells (reviewed by Greco, 2009, Hiscox, 2002, Hiscox, 2007). Well-documented studies have established that several of these nucleolar modifications play a role in some steps of the viral infection cycle such as viral attachment and entry, intracellular trafficking, transcription, translation, replication, virus assembly, and regress (reviewed by Greco, 2009). The virally induced nucleolar modifications could also affect fundamental cellular pathways including the initiation of transcription from the DNA promoter of the rRNA genes, cell-cycle regulation, and apoptosis (reviewed by Greco, 2009).",

This is because animal cells are separated by barriers far less formidable than the thick, rigid, and impermeable cell walls consisting of cellulose and pectin that separate plant cells from one another. Other differences relate to defense strategies employed by humans/animals and plants against viral infections. For example, in mammals the interferon (IFN) pathway plays a key role in the innate antiviral immune response, whereas plants do not display such an activity. Instead, plants primarily rely on other natural defense strategies such as RNA silencing. Interestingly, functional links between plant virus infection cycle and the nucleolus have been described for both common and plant-specific virus infection steps.",

However, later using improved sample preparation and in situ hybridization protocols, Qi and Ding (2003) have found that the (\u2212) strand of PSTVd localizes in the nucleoplasm but not in the nucleolus. By contrast, the (+) strand of PSTVd localizes in the nucleolus as well as in the nucleoplasm, with various distinct spatial patterns. These experiments are suggestive of successive stages of nuclear involvement in viroid replication: (1) synthesis of the (\u2212) and (+) strands of PSTVd occurs in the nucleoplasm; (2) the (\u2212) strand RNA is anchored in the nucleoplasm; (3) the (+) strand RNA is transported selectively into the nucleolus; and (4) some (+) strand RNA traffics from the nucleolus back into the nucleoplasm and further into the cytoplasm for spreading into neighboring cells. The significance of (+) strand PSTVd RNA trafficking into the nucleolus remains to be determined. However, nucleolar machineries for processing of rRNAs, snoRNAs, and tRNAs make the nucleolus an attractive candidate site for PSTVd processing. The specific intranuclear localization of (\u2212) and (+) strands of PSTVd may have some implication for pathogenicity. Assuming that the (\u2212) and (+) strands each can interact with specific cellular factors to disrupt normal cell functions to cause symptoms, the differential subnuclear localization of the (+) and (\u2212) strands of PSTVd may suggest different cellular targets for these RNAs.",

Umbraviruses differ from most other viruses in that they do not encode a CP such that conventional virus particles are not formed in infected plants. Umbraviral genomes encode at least three proteins. In GRV, two ORFs at the 5\u2032-end of the RNA are expressed by a frameshift mechanism as a single protein that appears to be an RNA replicase (Taliansky and Robinson, 2003). The other ORFs (ORF3 and ORF4) overlap each other. ORF4 encodes the MP that mediates the cell-to-cell movement of viral RNA via PD (Ryabov et al., 1998). ORF3 protein is the long-distance movement factor that facilitates trafficking of viral RNA through the phloem (Ryabov et al., 1999). Umbraviral ORF3 proteins (26\u201329 kDa) show no significant similarity with any other recorded or predicted proteins (Taliansky and Robinson, 2003). The GRV ORF3 protein interacts with viral RNA in vivo to form filamentous RNP particles, which have elements of regular helical structure, but not the uniformity typical of virus particles (Taliansky et al., 2003). The RNPs accumulate in cytoplasmic inclusions which have been detected in all cell types and were abundant in phloem cells (Taliansky et al., 2003). They serve to protect viral RNA and move it through the phloem to cause systemic infection. Remarkably, in addition to its presence in the cytoplasm, the ORF3 protein was also found in nuclei and predominantly in nucleoli (Ryabov et al., 1998, Ryabov et al., 2004).",

Nucleolar localization and further trafficking of ORF3 protein from the nucleolus back to the cytoplasm is essential for the umbravirus infection. The integral connection between nucleolar targeting of the ORF3 protein and its biological function in virus long-distance spread is demonstrated by mutagenesis of the arginine- and leucine-rich domains that block nucleolar localization or nuclear export of the ORF3 protein, and which prevent the formation of cytoplasmic viral RNPs and their long-distance movement (Kim et al., 2007a).",

Particular snRNP proteins contain modified symmetric di-methyl arginines (sDMAs) which enhance the formation of snRNPs and interaction with SMN (Paushkin et al., 2002). Preliminary experiments have identified sDMAs in the ORF3 protein (M. Taliansky, unpublished results), suggesting that targeting of the ORF3 protein to CBs could involve interactions with the SMN protein. Although SMN protein has yet to be identified in plants, the existence of an orthologue has been suggested (Collier et al., 2006).",

            "text": "ORF3 protein trafficking to the nucleolus uses a novel pathway of nucleolar import by causing the fusion of CBLs with the nucleolus. The physical and functional association of the nucleolus and CBs is well-documented and is controlled by complex molecular interactions among CB and nucleolar proteins such as coilin, SMN, fibrillarin, and Nopp140 (Cioce & Lamond, 2005, Ogg & Lamond, 2002). Expression of mutant versions of some of these proteins has profound effects on CB structure and function causing disruption or dispersal and compositional changes (Jones et al., 2001, Pellizzoni et al., 2001, Tucker et al., 2001). Moreover, phosphorylation of coilin is an important factor determining physical interactions and trafficking of CBs (Cioce & Lamond, 2005, Ogg & Lamond, 2002). For example, CBs form within the nucleolus of HeLa cells upon treatment with okadaic acid (an inhibitor of protein phosphatase) and with transient expression of coilin mutated at a single serine residue (Lyon et al., 1997, Sleeman et al., 1998). CBs have also been observed within nucleoli in human breast carcinomas (Ochs et al., 1994) and in liver cells of hibernating dormice (Malatesta et al., 1994). Therefore, the ORF3 protein may interfere with normal protein\u2013protein interactions or posttranslational modifications causing the reorganization and fusion of CBs with the nucleolus.",

            "text": "The last stage of the nuclear voyage of the ORF3 protein is its nuclear export leading to the redistribution of some fibrillarin from the nucleolus to cytoplasm (fibrillarin normally does not accumulate in cytoplasm) (Kim et al., 2007a). This redistribution is mediated by the direct interaction between the ORF3 protein and fibrillarin (Kim et al., 2007b). Taking into account the long-distance movement function of GRV ORF3, it could be expected that fibrillarin is directly involved in this particular viral function. Further support of a role for fibrillarin in umbravirus systemic infection has been provided by the fibrillarin knock-down experiments (Kim et al., 2007b). Silencing of the fibrillarin gene has indeed prevented formation of RNP particles and long-distance movement of GRV but does not affect viral replication or cell-to-cell movement. Thus, it has been concluded that fibrillarin is needed for formation of cytoplasmic RNP particles that are capable of long-distance movement and causing systemic viral infection such that the redistribution of fibrillarin with ORF3 protein is a prerequisite to form RNPs (Kim et al., 2007a, Kim et al., 2007b). Further experiments have shown that fibrillarin, in combination with ORF3 protein and viral RNA in vitro, produced filamentous RNP structures with structural properties similar to in vivo RNPs (as discussed in detail in Section IV.E). Fibrillarin, an RNA-binding protein, may bind the viral RNA or act as a chaperone to permit or catalyze the regular assembly of proteins around viral RNA. Although fibrillarin and ORF3 protein are sufficient to form functional viral RNP particles in vitro, additional proteins may also be associated with the in vivo particles. When formed in phloem companion cells, the viral RNPs are able to enter sieve elements and move through the plant to cause systemic infection. Hence formation of the fibrillarin-ORF3 protein complexes appears to be the key prerequisite for formation of GRV RNP particles and their long-distance movement through the phloem.",

Both CP and CP-RT contain the same NoLS, and are targeted to the nucleolus when they are individually expressed in plant tissues (Haupt et al., 2005). However, CP-RT but not PLRV CP loses its nucleolar localization in the presence of replicating PLRV. It has been suggested that the CP-RT protein does not accumulate in the nucleolus in the presence of PLRV infection because PLRV RNA or PLRV-encoded or -induced factors retain this protein outside the nucleolus (Haupt et al., 2005). Like GRV, PLRV has been unable to cause systemic infection in the fibrillarin-silenced plants, although accumulation of PLRV in the inoculated leaves was not affected (Kim et al., 2007b) suggesting that fibrillarin is also involved in PLRV long-distance movement.",

Torrance, personal communication). Moreover, the PMTV TGB1 protein has been shown to interact with fibrillarin in vitro. Interestingly, TGB1 protein encoded by the hordeivirus, PSLV can also interact with fibrillarin both in vitro and in vivo (N. O. Kalinina, unpublished results).

            "text": "NIa is multifunctional and consists of two domains. The N-proximal half of NIa is the VPg that is covalently linked to the 5\u2032-end of viral genomic RNA (Oruetxebarria et al., 2001, Siaw et al., 1985). The C-proximal part (NIa-Pro) is the main viral proteinase (Dougherty et al., 1989). The two domains are separated by a suboptimal proteolytic cleavage site, the slow processing of which is essential for efficient viral replication (Carrington et al., 1993, Schaad et al., 1996). The majority of full-length NIa is found in the nucleus of virus-infected cells (Carrington et al., 1993). However, NIa can also exist as a polyprotein with the 6K2 protein located upstream of NIa in the viral polyprotein. The 6K2 protein impedes nuclear localization of the 6K2-NIa polyprotein (Restrepo-Hartwig and Carrington, 1992) and directs NIa to cytoplasmic membrane vesicles, the sites of viral replication (Beauchemin et al., 2007, Cotton et al., 2009, Restrepo-Hartwig & Carrington, 1994, Schaad et al., 1997a). Many lines of evidence suggest that NIa is part of the viral replication complex involving several viral and host proteins (Beauchemin & Laliberte, 2007, Fellers et al., 1998, Li et al., 1997, Murphy et al., 1996, Puustinen & M\u00e4kinen, 2004, Schaad et al., 1996). The VPg domain has NTP binding activity, is uridylylated by NIb, and may act as a primer for synthesis of viral RNA (Anindya et al., 2005, Murphy et al., 1996, Puustinen & M\u00e4kinen, 2004, Schaad et al., 1996). In addition, VPg is involved in viral cell-to-cell and long-distance movement (Nicolas et al., 1997, Rajam\u00e4ki & Valkonen, 1999, Rajam\u00e4ki & Valkonen, 2002, Schaad et al., 1997b). The NLSs and NoLS of potyviral NIa map to the N-proximal part of VPg (Carrington et al., 1991, Rajam\u00e4ki & Valkonen, 2009, Schaad et al., 1996). The signal controlling nuclear localization of NIa is bipartite (Carrington et al., 1991, Rajam\u00e4ki & Valkonen, 2009, Schaad et al., 1996). The regions of NIa controlling nucleolar targeting of NIa have been studied in PVA and found to map to the same regions as the NLSs. However, mutations in both NLS regions are required to abolish nuclear targeting of PVA NIa, whereas mutations in either NLS prevent nucleolar localization of NIa (Rajam\u00e4ki and Valkonen, 2009). The most N-terminal NLS controls also localization of PVA NIa to CBs (Rajam\u00e4ki and Valkonen, 2009). Mutations that affect nuclear localization of NIa are detrimental for genome amplification of TEV and PVA (Rajam\u00e4ki & Valkonen, 2009, Schaad et al., 1996), suggesting that nuclear/nucleolar localization of NIa has an important role in virus infection.",

            "text": "Potyviral NIa (or VPg) has been shown to interact with several host proteins (Dunoyer et al., 2004, Huang et al., 2010, L\u00e9onard et al., 2004, Rajam\u00e4ki & Valkonen, 2009, Schaad et al., 2000, Thivierge et al., 2008, Wittmann et al., 1997). The structure of VPg is intrinsically disordered (Grzela et al., 2008, Rantalainen et al., 2008), which may provide flexibility for many types of interactions. One of the interaction partners of VPg and/or NIa is the eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF4E or its isoform (Robaglia & Caranta, 2006, Schaad et al., 2000, Wittmann et al., 1997) and the interaction appears important for virus infectivity (L\u00e9onard et al., 2000, Robaglia & Caranta, 2006). Remarkably, interaction of TuMV NIa with eIF(iso)4E and the poly(A) binding protein 2 (PABP2) has been detected in the nucleus and nucleolus using bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) and colocalization experiments (Beauchemin & Laliberte, 2007, Beauchemin et al., 2007). By contrast, interaction with the 6K2-NIa polyprotein targets eIF(iso)4E and PABP2 to cytoplasmic membrane vesicles (Beauchemin & Laliberte, 2007, Beauchemin et al., 2007). The data suggest that these host proteins are needed in different viral processes. In healthy plants, most of PABP is cytoplasmic but some of the protein is redistributed to the nucleolus probably by the NIa (Beauchemin and Laliberte, 2007). NIa appears to mediate also eIF(iso)4E localization to the nucleolus (Beauchemin et al., 2007) and could interact simultaneously with eIF(iso)4E and PABP2 as shown by in vitro binding assays and BiFC and colocalization experiments (Beauchemin and Laliberte, 2007). Hence, all three proteins may be part of the same complex. Although the role of interaction between NIa and eIF(iso)4E and/or PABP2 in the nucleus is currently unclear, some possibilities can be suggested. The nuclear pool of eIF4E takes part in mRNA export from the nucleus but may also be involved in nuclear translation and NMD of RNA (Strudwick and Borden, 2002). PABP regulates the initiation of protein synthesis, nuclear export of mature mRNAs, and mRNA stability and decay (Mangus et al., 2003). Interaction with NIa might disrupt some of these functions. As mentioned above, some animal viruses are known to modulate and inhibit activities of translation initiation factors in order to favor viral replication and translation (reviewed by Thompson and Sarnow, 2000).",

Indeed, this hypothesis gained support in the experiments in which overexpression of VPg in leaf tissues temporarily interfered with cosuppression of gene silencing (i.e., RNA silencing), whereas NLS mutants of VPg, which exhibited reduced nuclear and nucleolar localization, were not able to suppress RNA silencing (Rajam\u00e4ki and Valkonen, 2009).",

            "text": "RNA silencing is a sophisticated, sequence-specific RNA degradation mechanism operating in the cytoplasm (Ruiz-Ferrer and Voinnet, 2009). A key feature of the RNA silencing pathway is the generation of dsRNA that corresponds in sequence to the target (virus) RNA. This dsRNA is cleaved into siRNAs by DCLs and these mediate the target specificity for RNA degradation (for reviews, see Carrington, 2000, Ruiz-Ferrer & Voinnet, 2009, Vance & Vaucheret, 2001, Voinnet, 2001). RNA silencing is a natural anti-viral defense system of plants but is also involved in gene regulation in a wide range of developmental and pathogen defense processes (Ruiz-Ferrer and Voinnet, 2009). To combat host defense RNA silencing, most plant viruses encode silencing suppressor proteins. The potyviral helper-component proteinase (HC-Pro) was the first detected viral suppressor of RNA silencing (Anandalakshmi et al., 1998, Brigneti et al., 1998, Kasschau & Carrington, 1998) and the potyviral P1 protein may enhance its activity (Rajam\u00e4ki et al., 2005). HC-Pro acts in the cytoplasm and, therefore, the association of VPg with RNA silencing suppression when localized in the nucleolus is intriguing because many host proteins involved in RNA silencing as well as the processing centers for small RNAs are located in the nucleus, nucleolus, and CBs as discussed in Section II (Pontes and Pikaard, 2008).",

Depletion of fibrillarin reduces PVA accumulation in Nicotiana benthamiana, suggesting a role for fibrillarin in virus infection (Rajam\u00e4ki and Valkonen, 2009). As mentioned above, in GRV, fibrillarin is recruited for viral long-distance transport (Canetta et al., 2008, Kim et al., 2007a, Kim et al., 2007b), but in potyviruses the role is likely to be different as long-distance transport of PVA is not compromised by depletion of fibrillarin (Rajam\u00e4ki and Valkonen, 2009). Taking into account the silencing suppression activity of VPg, it could be suggested that VPg-fibrillarin might contribute to such an activity. Alternatively, the fibrillarin\u2013VPg interaction may disrupt certain nucleolar functions (e.g., host transcription or pre-mRNA processing), which might explain the observed shutdown of host gene expression during potyvirus infection (Wang and Maule, 1995).",

For example, the NS1 protein of influenza A virus is an important factor in counteracting IFN-based cellular antiviral mechanisms (Hale et al., 2008). In addition, NS1 is also able to suppress RNA silencing in plant, insect, and mammalian cells (Bucher et al., 2004, de Vries et al., 2009, Delgadillo et al., 2004, Haasnoot et al., 2007, Li et al., 2004).

While viral replication takes place in the cytoplasm on cellular membranes, NIb is also targeted to the nucleus and the nucleolus (Baunoch et al., 1991, Restrepo et al., 1990). Nuclear targeting of NIb appears to be highly sensitive to alterations in protein conformation and is eliminated by deletions, dipeptide insertions and amino acid substitutions introduced also into parts of NIb other than the NLSs (Li and Carrington, 1993). Nuclear and nucleolar localization of NIb may be important for the viral infection cycle, because mutations in the NLSs abolish infectivity of TEV (Li & Carrington, 1995, Li et al., 1997). Three host proteins, the PABP2, the heat shock cognate 70 protein (Hsc70-3), and the eukaryotic translation elongation factor 1A, eIF1A, interact with NIb (Dufresne et al., 2008, Thivierge et al., 2008, Wang et al., 2000a, Wang et al., 2000b).

Although a NoLS has not been identified for this protein, its nucleolar import might be facilitated by its interaction with ribosomal proteins of the 60S ribosomal subunit (Haas et al., 2008). The presence of P6 in the nucleolus, where assembly of ribosomal subunits occurs, raises the possibility that P6 might interact directly with ribosomes before their export to render them competent for translation of the CaMV polycistronic mRNA. Indeed, P6 interacts with the ribosomal proteins L18 (Leh et al., 2000), L24 (Park et al., 2001), and L13 (Bureau et al., 2004), which hence may be the potential targets because they participate in the formation of the 60S subunit in the nucleolus (Andersen et al., 2002). Another functional activity of CaMV P6 is suppression of RNA silencing. This protein interferes with RNA-directed RNA polymerase 6 (RDR6)-dependent RNA silencing via inhibition of the dsRNA-binding protein DRB4, a protein normally enhancing DCL4-mediated dicing. However, unlike nuclear targeting, the nucleolar localization of P6 is completely dispensable for its silencing suppression function (Haas et al., 2008).",

For example, fibrillarin is one of the four core protein components of a box C/D snoRNP complex (reviewed by Tran et al., 2004). Being a methyltransferase, fibrillarin (as a component of box C/D snoRNPs) functions in the 2\u2032-in vitro-methylation and processing of pre-rRNA. In addition, human fibrillarin forms a subcomplex with splicing factor 2-associated p32, protein arginine methyltransferases, and tubulins \u03b13 and \u03b21 that is independent of its association with snoRNPs, suggesting that fibrillarin may also coordinate protein methylation during the processes of ribosome biogenesis (Yanagida et al., 2004). Furthermore fibrillarin interacts with some other cellular proteins such as SMN protein (Jones et al., 2001) and the nuclear DEAD box protein p68, an RNA-dependent ATPase and RNA helicase (Nicol et al., 2000). However, the physiological role of these interactions is unclear and may be based on novel natural functions of fibrillarin that remain to be established.",

            "text": "The most studied viral RNP complex containing fibrillarin is the GRV ORF3 complex with elements of regular helical structure that is capable of long-distance movement via the phloem. Assembly of GRV RNP particles occurs in the cytoplasm and requires fibrillarin relocalized from the nucleolus (Kim et al., 2007a, Kim et al., 2007b, Taliansky et al., 2003; also see above). RNP particles similar in architecture and infectivity to the viral RNPs formed in vivo, have been reconstituted in vitro from fibrillarin, the ORF3 protein and viral RNA (Kim et al., 2007a, Kim et al., 2007b). Taking the study further, the in vitro experiments have shown that the ORF3-fibrillarin interaction occurs between the leucine-rich region (L149 in particular) of the ORF3 protein and the GAR domain of fibrillarin (Kim et al., 2007b) known to be responsible for interaction with other proteins such as SMN (Jones et al., 2001). This interaction leads to formation of single-layered ring-like complexes of ORF3 with fibrillarin as was shown by atomic force microscopy (Canetta et al., 2008). The diameter of these ORF3 protein-fibrillarin rings is 18\u201322 nm which correlates with that of the filamentous RNP particles (Canetta et al., 2008). It thus appears that the ORF3 protein fibrillarin rings interact with viral RNA, encapsidating it and reorganizing it into helical structures, and thereby play a key role in the assembly of umbraviral RNP complexes. These results demonstrate that, in addition to traditional functions in rRNA processing and modification, fibrillarin possesses completely novel functions in mediating assembly of umbraviral RNPs. These functions are presumably based on the ability of the ORF3 protein to interact and form ring-like complexes with fibrillarin such that the virus alters and exploits the properties of fibrillarin for successful virus propagation.",

However, recent multiple lines of investigation have confirmed and characterized additional roles for nucleoli in other important cellular processes including cell-cycle control, stress responses, and coordination of the biogenesis of a number of other functional RNPs. The nucleus has also been shown to play a crucial role in the infection cycle of various viruses, and the nucleolar localization of viral proteins has recently been described as a pan-virus phenomenon (Hiscox, 2002, Hiscox, 2007). In this regard, plant viruses are not different from other eukaryotic viruses. The past few years have brought remarkable progress in our understanding of why and how some plant viruses (in particular, umbraviruses and potyviruses) target the nucleolus and the functional role of the interaction between viral and nucleolar proteins in the plant virus infection cycle. For many other plant virus proteins, nucleolar localization and interaction with nucleolar components have also been demonstrated, and functional implications of these findings is a challenge for future research. We anticipate that more information will emerge about the mechanisms involved in regulating nucleolar function and structure in response to plant virus infections and hijacking nucleolar functions for the virus infection cycle. There are now several examples in which the plant viruses also target other subnuclear bodies, such as CBs. In particular, for umbraviruses the role of CBs in nucleolar trafficking of the ORF3 protein has been established. The potential role of sub-nuclear structures in other plant virus infections will be addressed in the future.",

For example, as previously discussed, the major nucleolar protein fibrillarin, is involved in formation and long-distance movement of umbraviral RNP particles. These functions as well as other potential yet unrecognized natural functions of nucleolar proteins will be the focus of much future research. On a practical level, both the plant cell and viral biology of the nucleolus can, and hopefully will be exploited for the design of novel strategies to control plant virus infections.",
