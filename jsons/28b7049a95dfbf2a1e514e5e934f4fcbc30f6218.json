While a large number of cases of diarrhoea are of viral (rotavirus) or bacterial (Salmonella, Escherichia coli) origin, necessitating only oral rehydration, some are of parasitological origin (Giardia, Entamoeba histolytica, Strongyloides, Trichuris, Schistosoma) and can be cured by a single dose treatment (tinidazole, secnidazole, ivermectin, albendazole, praziquantel). Secnidazole is the nitroimidazole with the longest half-life and is, therefore, used in single dose treatments for Giardia, acute intestinal amoebiasis and E. histolytica cyst carriers. Single dose treatments of most intestinal parasites will be a major advance in the management of tropical infectious diarrhoea. In the next decade, opportunistic intestinal infections (Cryptosporidium, Isospora, Enterocytozoon) in AIDS patients that are refractory to treatment could be the major problem.",

A well known example is the treatment of bilharziasis by niridazole, which necessitated hospitalisation of patients for a week because of possible psychosis. Currently, only a single dose of praziquantel or metrifonate is required to treat bilharziasis in outpatients.l1. 2 1 Important advances in tropical medicine have been achieved with the development of single dose treatments. This was the case for malaria, with the use of new drugs with long half-lives such as sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, mefloquine or halofantrineP-5 1 A real opportunity to lower the incidence of filariasis and onchocerciasis throughout the world was provided by the development of ivermectin, with treatment requiring 2 tablets every 6 to 12 months. [6, 71 Ivermectin has also proven its efficiency for scabies[81 and cutaneous larva migrans.[91 Single dose treatments are also widely used for the treatment of genitourinary infections, e.g. pefloxacin in gonorrhoea and bladder infections, and tinidazole or secnidazole in genital trichomoniasis and vaginal bacteriosis) lO-13] One of the major threats to health in tropical countries is diarrhoea. Recently, the WHO estimated that there are 3 to 5 billion individuals with diarrhoea each year and 5 to 10 million die) 14] In tropical countries, children under the age of 5 are particularly susceptible, and diarrhoea accounts for 7% of deaths in this age group. In addition, the development of AIDS led to the frequent occurrence of devastating and treatment-resistant diarrhoeas. Lastly, intestinal infections occur in thousands of travellers each year. IIS ] Some of these intestinal infections will be of bacterial or parasitic origin and potentially curable by single dose treatments. This paper will review the main causes of infectious diarrhoea in tropical areas and highlight the cases where singlc dose therapy is possible. Bacterial food poisoning will not be discussed because diarrhoea is due to ingested toxins and not to the development of microorganisms in the intestine.",

Because of the difficulty of surveillance, there have been few communitybased studies of the enteropathogens associated with diarrhoea. Among 8139 patients with diarrhoea in Bangladesh, Black et al. 116 ] reported 26% with enterotoxinogenic Escherichia coli, 12% with Vibrio cholerae, 5% with Shigella, 4% with Entamoeba histolytica, 2% with Giardia and less than I % with Salmonella.

For parasitic infections, information can be obtained from residents of industrialised countries who acquired a single infection during travel in tropical countries. 117 ] Causes and mechanisms of tropical infectious diarrhoea are summarised in table 1.

These organisms may elaborate multiple virulence determinants, including fimbrial adhesins, and heat labile and heat stable enterotoxins. Enteroinvasive E. coli cause dysentery by invading epithelial cells of the colon in a similar manner to Shigella. Enteropathogenic E. coli have no recognisable toxin.

This local inflammatory response (associated with toxins of bacterial origin) causes secretion, and the damaged epithelium is unable to reabsorb fluids from gut lumen. Salmonella and Campylobacter are found in the intestine of many vertebrates and are present in water and contaminated food. Humans are the only natural host of Shigella, and contamination usually results from person to person transmission.

Although an estimated 500 million people are infected by this parasite, only 1.5 million will develop symptomatic disease, resulting in 50 to 100 000 deaths) 31] This gap between the number of infected and symptomatic people has led some authors to consider the hypothesis that 2 species of E. histolytica exist: one pathogenic, the other nonpathogenic. [32] This hypothesis was confirmed by isoenzyme analysis, which showed an association between a specific pattern and pathogenicity)33] However, this now widely accepted hypothesis was discussed by some authors claiming that a change of pattern was possible after bacterial influence,l34] Experimental studies in vitro have shown that the cytolytic potential of E. histolytica was dramatically increased when associated with bacteria. 134] The first step in invasion is adhesion to the epithelium, mediated by a galactose binding protein. [35, 36] Following con-tact, cytolysis occurs rapidly and is dependent on phospholipase activity, pore-forming peptides and proteolytic enzymes.

Tests of mutagenicity using Salmonella typhi and E. coli were positive.

In the late seventies, the possible carcinogenicity of metronidazole was evaluated in animal studies. However, the methodology used was questionable, and carcinogenicity in humans is not considered to be a problem.f88] Although no evidence of any teratogenic effect has been observed in experimental studies of secnidazole, [72] the drug should not be administered during the first trimester of pregnancy or during lactation because secnidazole can be detected in the placenta and breast milk. This could be a potential limitation for mass treatment. However, a review of more than 2000 pregnant women treated with metronidazole did not identify an in creased incidence of malformations. [88, 89] The only real but rare contraindication to secnidazole is a known hypersensitivity to nitroimidazoles (urticaria).
