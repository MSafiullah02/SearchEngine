            "text": "The lung is among the most dynamic organs in the human body. Through breathing, the\nlung is constantly exposed to the external environment which often includes\nenvironmental pollutants, bacteria, viruses, or allergens [4], which can provoke inflammation and activate signaling\ncascades that protect lung function ordinarily, but can disrupt lung function when\nthey become dysregulated [5,6]. Moreover, with every respiratory cycle,\nlung volume changes considerably [7\u20139]. As a result, all\ncell types of diverse functions that reside in the lung are subjected to stretch and\ndistortion [10\u201312]. These mechanical stresses have been shown to play\ncritical roles in some of the most important biological processes in the lung [11,13,14]. For example, mechanical\nstress can guide branching morphogenesis and alveolar growth and thus results in the\nattainment of normal lung architecture later in life [15,16]. In addition,\nduring lung development, both cell proliferation and differentiation can be promoted\nby mechanical stresses through the activation of signaling pathways that affect the\nproduction of extracellular matrix molecules and the expression of specific genes\n[17]. Unlike these ordinary mechanical\nstimuli, excessive mechanical stresses generated under certain pathological\nconditions not only impair protective functions but also lead to lung injury [9]. For example, application of mechanical\nventilation is commonly used to support patients in respiratory distress [9]. In these patients, excessive mechanical\nstresses are transmitted across the pleural surface and alveolar wall to constituent\ncells, and the associated excessive mechanical stresses can cause\nventilation-induced lung injury [18,19].",

Asthma is\ncharacterized by chronic airway inflammation, airway remodeling, and excessive\nconstriction of the airway [23]. As a\ncommon feature of asthma that causes symptoms, constriction of the airway occurs due\nto the tightening of surrounding smooth muscle [24]. This may arise in response to a variety of causes including\nexercise, environmental exposure, and can be worsened by both recurrent infection\nand, in sensitized patients, allergen exposure [24\u201327].

            "text": "During asthmatic bronchoconstriction, airway smooth muscle generates excessive\nmechanical force that can collapse the lumen [25,33], and subsequently, the\nlung structural cells within the airway experience considerable compressive stress.\nThese cells form the air\u2013tissue interface in the airways of all vertebrate\nspecies [34]. During a normal respiratory\ncycle, the transmural and transepithelial stresses are low and similar to\ntranspulmonary pressure [35]. However, the\nassociated mechanical stress, during bronchoconstriction, is considerably higher and\ncan lead to airway wall buckling and the formation of rosette patterns [36]. Although the exact patterns of collapse\nduring bronchoconstriction vary depending on the elements of airway wall, the\npattern occurs due to the bicycle mechanical property of the basement membrane:\nstiff in extension but floppy in compression [36]. In asthmatics, the airway wall is thickened due to tissue\nremodeling [29,37]. Near the apex of the folding, the epithelial cells are\nopposed to each other and squeezed, exposing them to considerable compressive\nstress, especially during bronchoconstriction [36,37]. Wiggs and co-workers\nanalyzed and estimated the magnitude of the mechanical stress on airway epithelial\ncells during asthmatic bronchoconstriction [37]. They estimated the mechanical properties of the two layers that\nwere used to model the airway wall and theorized the hoop stress that airway smooth\nmuscle would exert during maximal bronchoconstriction. Rosette patterns of\ndeformation in the airway induced by bronchoconstriction were analyzed using finite\nelement methods. They found that airway epithelial cells are subjected to\n\u223c30 cm H2O compressive stress during maximal\nbronchoconstriction, which is thought to be at least an order of magnitude higher\nthan the transepithelial stress on airway epithelial cells during normal respiratory\ncycle [37]. This change in the physical\nenvironment leads to altered biochemical properties, which represents an active area\nof investigation both in vitro and in vivo [19,32,38].",

Ressler et al. first demonstrated that airway epithelial cells\ngenerate rapid and robust cellular responses after mechanical compression [40]. Using air-liquid interface-cultured rat\ntracheal epithelial cells, they found that after compression, epithelial cells\nexpress early growth response protein 1 (EGR), endothelin 1 (ET-1), and transforming\ngrowth factor beta 1. Tschumperlin and co-workers observed similar responses using\nprimary human airway epithelial cells [41].\nMore importantly, they identified a novel mechanism of mechano-transduction, which\ncombines the shedding of epidermal growth factor with a reduction in lateral space\nbetween epithelial cells during compression [41]. A subsequent study using computational modeling and analysis showed\nthat constant rate shedding of autocrine ligands into a collapsing lateral\nintercellular space leads to increased local ligand concentrations that are\nsufficient to account for observed receptor signaling [42]. They found that the decrease in lateral intercellular\nspace peaked at 10 min after compression, and the concentration of\nheparin-binding epidermal growth factor (HB-EGF) in the lateral intercellular space\nis increased [42]. The release of epidermal\ngrowth factor receptor ligand HB-EGF activates this G-protein-coupled receptor and\ndownstream signaling ensues [41]. HB-EGF\nhas been shown to lead to epithelial remodeling [43,44]. Another study examined\nthe impact of epithelial compression on the epithelium itself. This diverse tissue\ncontains several different cell types, including mucus-secreting goblet cells.\nGoblet cells are more abundant in the epithelium of asthmatic patients and play an\nimportant part in mucus hypersecretion [45]. Upon repetitive mechanical stress, cultured epithelial cells underwent\ngoblet cell hyperplasia [46]. This mucus\nsecretion increases the resistance of airways and, in some cases, can completely\nocclude the tubular structure.",

Indeed, a recent study\ndemonstrated that epithelial\u2014ASM cell co-culture led to a less contractile\nASM cell [49]; however, this study utilized\nsubmerged (non-air\u2013liquid interface) epithelial cultures. Another study\nshowed that compressed epithelial cells induce ASM cell contractility through the\nrelease of the contractile agonist endothelin-1 (ET-1) [48]. Intriguingly, asthmatic human bronchial epithelial (HBE)\ncells led to a leftward shift in the dose-response curve of ET-1 release due to\ncompressive stress [48]. This sensitivity\nof asthmatic epithelium to mechanical forces may represent a previously unidentified\nmechanism by which asthmatic HBE cells lead to ASM remodeling. The mechanism\nproposed also involves a feed-forward loop through which smooth muscle mass and\ncontractility are correlated with compressed epithelial cells, which in turn could\nperpetuate this loop [48]. Further, when\nHBE cells were cultured from asthmatic subjects, the HBE cells induced differences\nin the contractile responses of ASM cells at lower magnitudes of compressive stress\n[48]. This implicates the asthmatic\nepithelium as a hyper-responsive tissue exposed to the compressive environment of\nthe diseased airway and further strengthens the link between bronchoconstriction and\nairway remodeling. Lan et al. also observed an increased proliferation in ASM cells\nthat were cultured in compressed epithelial conditioned medium [48], indicating that these two phenotypes can\nco-exist.",

Increased\nbulk tissue within the contractile element of the airway could contribute to smaller\nairways and therefore increased resistance; however, increased rigidity would oppose\nthe contractile effect of smooth muscle [54]. Increased collagen surrounding the airway tree was speculated to\nprevent the efficacy of glucocorticoid administered to act upon proliferating ASM\ncells [55] and may prevent the access of\npharmacological therapeutics to ASM. Nearly 20 years ago, Swartz et al.\ndemonstrated that epithelial\u2013fibroblast co-cultures produced more type III\ncollagen when the epithelial cells had been exposed to mechanical compression prior\nto the co-culture [56]. Although the\nmechanism was unclear, this seminal study laid the ground work for several important\nsubsequent publications. Choe et al. showed that lateral compressive strain applied\nto tissue-engineered airways leads to the production of collagen types III and IV\n[57]. The extracellular matrix may also\ncontribute to the remodeling of ASM, as asthmatic ASM cells were shown to produce\nmore collagen I and perlecan than cells cultured from healthy subjects, and these\nmatrix proteins lead to a more proliferative ASM cell [58]. The native, nonconstricted epithelium has been well\ndescribed to induce proliferative responses in airway smooth muscle cells. Some work\nsuggests that proliferating smooth muscle is in a reduced-contractile state due to\nthe pleiotropic transcription factors that control these fates [59]; however, more work in this area needs to\nbe conducted.",

            "text": "Much of the pioneering work in the field of epithelial compression-regulated airway\nremodeling was performed on air\u2013liquid interface cultures. However,\nexcitingly, Grainge et al. conducted a study on human subjects to uncover the role\nof airway narrowing on airway remodeling [62]. Asthmatic subjects who were challenged with methacholine, a\nbronchoconstrictor, demonstrated increased goblet cell hyperplasia and increased\nthickening of the basement membrane [62].\nAs controls, some patients were given a beta-agonist prior to the administration of\nmethacholine to keep the airways relaxed [62]. This confirmed prior in vitro work and critically informed the\nfield of the importance of preventing asthma exacerbation to hinder further airway\nremodeling processes. Yet, these evidences were primarily based on biopsies. On the\nother hand, Janssen et al. found that repeated methacholine challenge over the\ncourse of 3 years did not result in significant changes in lung function [63]. It is possible that the impact of airway\nremodeling presented by Grainge et al. may not be large enough to change lung\nfunction. A similar study was performed in BALB/c mice to assess the influence of\nmultiple constriction events on airway mechanics and remodeling [64]. Surprisingly, 48 h after the\nfinal administration of methacholine, the airway mechanical responses to\nmethacholine were unchanged, as was a majority of readouts for airway remodeling\n[64]. However, goblet cell hyperplasia\nwas indeed observed [64]. This also\nhighlights the interspecies variability of these systems and suggests one should be\ncautious when drawing comparisons from mouse models of airway disease to asthma in\nhuman subjects. There are clearly diverse mechanisms by which compression of the\nairway wall can lead to remodeling of the airways and contribute to disease\npathogenesis. The remodeling events induced by bronchoconstriction are likely to be\ncomplex in nature. Although in vitro studies demonstrate promising results of\ncompression induced airway remodeling, it is worth noting that more in vivo studies\nare necessary to better illustrate this process. In addition, the number of studies\nusing animal models to investigate airway remodeling events is also rather limited.\nFurther work examining the intricacies of these signaling pathways in\nthree-dimensional tissue cultures, animals, and humans is necessary to better\nunderstand the process by which the asthmatic airway becomes remodeled.",

Dysregulation of the airway epithelium has\nbeen attributed to downstream effects of an upstream cascade of immune and\ninflammatory events, such as type 2 inflammation. However, since coordinated\ncommunication between biochemical and mechanical signals guides the function of the\nepithelium, it is possible that mechanical stimuli, like epithelial compression, may\nalso connect to the deregulated epithelial cells in asthma. Recent evidence from\nPark and co-workers discovered that the maturing epithelial cells in\nair\u2013liquid interface culture undergoes a transition from a fluid-like,\nmigratory unjammed state to a solid-like, quiescent, jammed state through a process\nreferred to as a jamming transition, which is delayed in cells cultured from\nasthmatic subjects [66]. Whether this delay\narises from layer injury, immaturity, or dysmaturity remains unclear. However, it\nhas been shown that the unique dynamic features of the jamming transition are deeply\nconnected to cell shape [66,67]. More importantly, the jamming and\nunjamming transitions, with universal signature in cell shape and variation, can be\nfound in many other important processes of epithelial biology, including embryo\ndevelopment and cancer invasion [67\u201370]. Park and\ncolleagues also found that application of an apical-to-basal mechanical stress\nmimicking the compressive effect of bronchoconstriction can trigger the unjamming\ntransition in a pseudostratified primary human bronchial epithelial layer [66]. This suggests that mechanical\ncompression itself could be an important contributor to the unjammed epithelial\ncells in asthmatics. Further studies exploring the connection between cell jamming\nin airway epithelial cells and airway remodeling are necessary to determine its role\nin asthma.",

Moreover,\nthe compressive effect on the epithelium, induced by bronchoconstriction, can lead\nto increased smooth muscle mass and contraction [49], which can further increase the degree of constriction, suggesting\nthat there may be a potential positive feedback loop of bronchoconstriction in\nasthmatics (Fig. 1). Thus, breaking this\nviscous loop could be an effective way to control airway remodeling progression.\nSurprisingly, the best defense system against bronchoconstriction is already in our\nbody. In 1864, Henry Salter first described that constriction of the airway can be\nbroken by simply taking a long, deep, full inspiration [72]. Until this day, a simple deep inspiration (DI), which\noccurs roughly six times per hour [72,73], is still the most effective\nbronchodilator known [74\u201378]. Further studies suggest that a DI can\nalso protect the airway and prevent subsequent constriction [76,79\u201382]. However, the beneficial effect of DI is\nimpaired in the asthmatics. Numerous studies demonstrated that DI-induced\nbronchodilation and stretch are dependent on the activation state of ASM [83\u201385]. More activation in ASM leads to less strain and less relaxation for\nany given tidal volume. Thus, it is likely that the airways in asthmatic patients\ncannot bronchodilate due to the undergoing asthmatic exacerbation. This could lead\nto prolonged compression of the airway epithelial tissue in asthmatics, which in\nturn will likely lead to further airway remodeling.",

In response to a transient stretch, the\ncytoskeleton of airway smooth muscle undergoes a rapid transition from a solid\ncontractile state to a fluid-like relax state, termed fluidization [92,95,96]. Targeting fluidization\nmay perhaps restore the impaired bronchodilator effect in asthmatics. Although the\nmechanism of fluidization transition is still unclear, it has been shown that the\ndisruption of actomyosin during transient stretch is an important contributor to\nfluidization [89,91,92,97]. Recent evidence from Lan and co-workers\nsuggest that cofilin, an actin severing protein, plays a critical role in the\nfluidization response [98]. Thus, it is\npossible that cofilin and its associated signaling pathway may hold the key to break\nthe viscous cycle of bronchoconstriction.",

In\nfact, new therapeutic approaches combining sustained bronchoprotection and\nanti-inflammatory treatments suggest that long-acting\n\u03b22-agonist combined with corticosteroid administration is a\nfar more effective treatment of asthma than high doses of corticosteroid alone\n[99\u2013101].

Thus, one important open question remains concerning the\nunknown roles of bronchoconstriction in inflammation and innate immune responses.
