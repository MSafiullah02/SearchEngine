Results were available within an average of 15 hours (range 10-19) at our institution.8 UW Virology laboratory has the capacity to run 4000 cases per day of a \u201cnon-rapid\u201d SC2 test called \u201cSARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) Qualitative PCR.\u201d Results are expected the same day for specimens received in the morning, next day otherwise.8 In principle, the RT-PCR test has 100% sensitivity (true positive rate). Due to sampling error or biology of the disease, e.g., virus present in the lower, but not upper respiratory tract, in the clinical setting the test results in some false negatives. A 2020 study compared chest CT and RT-PCR on 51 patients in China. Chest CT showed a sensitivity of 98% while RT-PCR showed a sensitivity of 71% from the first throat swab or sputum. On the 2nd RT-PCR, 23% of those initial negatives were positive, on the 3rd test 4% were positive, and on the 4th test 2% were positive.9\n,\n10 The current clinical sensitivity and specificity for SC2 testing using RT-PCR at UW is reported to be high, but actual values are unknown, as there is no gold standard for COVID-19 status.",

To qualify for urgent operative treatment, the patient must be asymptomatic and have a negative SC2 test result within 72 hours of the procedure.
