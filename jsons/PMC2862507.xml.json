Not only sarcoidosis is a close clinical mimic of TB, which makes the diagnosis of sarcoidosis (vs. TB) difficult in countries with high prevalence of TB, and vice versa, but TB has also been linked to causation of sarcoidosis. All those who deal with such conditions would remember the cases, when TB, after successful treatment (or during it), is followed by a diagnosis of sarcoidosis and more commonly when patient being treated with steroids following with a diagnosis of sarcoidosis, land up with TB. In both of the clinical scenarios, the authenticity of the primary diagnosis has to be confirmed, before one can say that either of the conditions has lead to the other one.",

So is there any merit in reviving this old forgotten term?",

Similarly, the case 2,[4] could be a presentation of sarcoidosis as pleural effusion with spontaneous resolution of pleural effusion[5] followed by development of typical sarcoid manifestations or could be sarcoidosis following a tuberculous pleural effusion. Cases 3 and 4 are again examples of coexisting TB and sarcoidosis with sequential and uninterrupted progression of one disease into another. Case 5 is the most typical presentation of sarcoidosis which one can encounter and just on the basis of fibrinoid necrosis resembling caseation the patient was initiated on antituberculous therapy.[6] The illustrative cases reveal only one fact: That is, the clinician should be astute to pick up the typical presentations. Finally, the diagnostic criteria laid down by Shah et al. [Table 1] are highly nonspecific and the only specific findings are those that are well known to be associated with sarcoidosis, and include typical clinical presentation with characteristic radiological and histopathological findings.",

This method has been used successfully in identifying Tropheryma whippelli as a causative agent for Whipple's disease[12] and coronaviruses[13] as an agent for severe acute respiratory syndrome. In a recent meta-analysis, we have shown that there is a 25.6% (95% CI, 23.6 \u2013 29.5%) prevalence of mycobacterial DNA in patients with sarcoidosis with the odds of finding mycobacteria in samples of patients with sarcoidosis versus controls being 9.67 (95% CI, 4.56 \u2013 20.5).[14] These results indicate that there is a definite link between TB and sarcoidosis. It might be appropriate to consider that the situation of sarcoidosis is analogous to leprosy in which the tuberculoid (pauci-bacillary) and lepromatous (multi-bacillary) forms are encountered; and, sarcoidosis might represent the tuberculoid form of the pathological responses to mycobacteria.[15]",
