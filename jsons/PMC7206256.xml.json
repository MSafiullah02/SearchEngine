Currently, the commonly used text segmentation is in word granularity only, especially for Chinese. However, many researchers have realized that a text can be viewed from not only word granularity but also the others.",

Eventually, more and more researchers turn to design semantic matching strategy combing word and phrase granularity, such as MultiGranCNN [24], MV-LSTM [15], MPCM [22], BiMPM [21], DIIN [3]. These models somehow overcome the word-granularity modelling limitations, however, they still cannot thoroughly solve the issue of semantic loss in the process of sentence encoding, especially for Chinese corpus which are usually with rich semantic features.",

However, most Chinese characters cannot be treated as independent words or phrases as these works did. This is because the simple combining of characters or words together, or encoding characters according to character lattice may easily lose the meaning that is embedded in the corresponding character.",

Our model significantly improves the representation of textual features. Moreover, for most existing deep learning applications, cross-entropy is a commonly used loss function to train the models. We design a novel loss function, which utilizes mean square error (MSE) as an equilibrium parameter to strengthen and enhance cross-entropy with the ability to distinguish the fuzzy classification boundary, which greatly improves the performance of our model.",

The researchers then begin to consider obtaining more semantic features from texts on different granularity. In the matching process, both the sentence and the word, phrase perspectives are considered. The results of multi-faceted feature matching are combined to get better results [1, 15, 19, 21, 23, 24]. Yin et al. propose MultiGranCNN to first obtain text features on different granularity such as words, phrases, and sentences, and then concatenate these text features and calculate the similarity between the two sentences [24]. Wan et al. propose MV-LSTM method similar to MultiGranCNN, which can capture long-distance and short-distance dependencies simultaneously [15]. MIX is a multi-channel convolutional neural network model for text matching, with additional attention mechanisms on sentences and semantic features [1]. MIX compares text fragments on varied granularity to form a series of multi-channel similarity matrices, which are then crossed with another set of carefully designed attention matrices to expose the rich structure of sentences to a deep neural network. Though all the above methods perform feature representation for the same text on word, phrase and sentence granularity simultaneously, they still ignore the influence of features on other granularity, such as character. In order to solve this problem in Chinese language, we generate corresponding text vectors, extracting the character-granularity and the corresponding word-granularity features separately. The feature on each granularity is captured from the corresponding text sequence.",

            "text": "Most tasks in natural language processing field can be considered as classification problems. For classification tasks, the most commonly used loss function in deep learning methods is cross-entropy. In view of the related tasks in computer vision, a series of loss functions based on optimization have been proposed to improve face recognition [2, 8, 17], image segmentation [11, 13, 14] and other tasks. Compared with computer vision, there is few related work on reconstructing loss function for a specific task in natural language processing field. Kriz et al. present a customized loss function to replace the standard cross-entropy during training, which takes the complexity of content words into account [6]. They propose a metric that modifies cross-entropy loss to up weight simple words and down weight more complex words for sentence simplification. Besides, Hsu et al. introduce the inconsistency loss function to replace cross-entropy loss in text extraction and summarization [4]. To better distinguish the classification results, Zhang et al. modify the cross-entropy loss function and apply it on the text matching task [25]. Inspired by the work, we propose a new loss function, where MSE is used as the balance factor to enhance the cross-entropy loss function. It can strengthen the ability to distinguish the fuzzy classification boundary in the training process and improve classification accuracy.",

After testing a variety number of multi-granularity embedding layer, we empirically set its dimensionality to 300. The number of units in multi-granularity fusion encoding layer is set to 300. In the Interaction matching layer, the widths of the dense layers are shown in Fig. 3. In addition, the last dense layer utilizes sigmoid as the activation function and the other dense layers use relu. And in the multi-granularity fusion layer, we set dropout rate to 0.5. In the optimization, the epochs number is 200 and batch size is 512. We set up the early stopping mechanism. After 10 epochs, if the accuracy is not improved on the validation set, the training process will automatically stop and verify the model\u2019s performance on the test set.",

Specifically, we integrate word and character embedding representations together, and capture more hierarchical matching features between sentences. In addition, to solve the fuzzy boundary problem in the classification process, we use MSE as an equilibrium factor to improve the cross-entropy loss function. Extensive experiments on the real-world data set, i.e., LCQMC, have clearly shown that our model outperforms the existing state-of-the-art methods. In future, we will introduce more features on different granularity. i.e., n-grams and phrases, etc., to encode and represent the sentences more comprehensively, and try to further improve semantic matching performance.",
