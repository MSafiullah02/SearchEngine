            "text": "The effect of lockdown due to coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic on air pollution in four Southern European cities (Nice, Rome, Valencia and Turin) and Wuhan (China) was quantified, with a focus on ozone (O 3 ). Compared to the same period in 2017-2019, the daily O 3 mean concentrations increased at urban stations by 24% in Nice, 14% in Rome, 27% in Turin, 2.4% in Valencia and 36% in Wuhan during the lockdown in 2020. This increase in O 3 concentrations is mainly explained by an unprecedented reduction in NO x emissions leading to a lower O 3 titration by NO. Strong reductions in NO 2 mean concentrations were observed in all European cities, ~ 53% at urban stations, comparable to Wuhan (57%), and ~ 65% at traffic stations. NO declined even further, ~ 63% at urban stations and ~ 78% at traffic stations in Europe. Reductions in PM 2.5 and PM 10 at urban stations were overall much smaller both in magnitude and relative change in Europe (~ 8%) than in Wuhan (~ 42%). The PM reductions due to limiting transportation and fuel combustion in institutional and commercial buildings were partly offset by increases of PM emissions from the activities at home in some of the cities. The NO x concentrations during the lockdown were on average 49% lower than those at weekends of the previous years in all cities. The lockdown effect on O 3 production was ~ 10% higher than the weekend effect in Southern Europe and 38% higher in Wuhan, while for PM the lockdown had the same effect as weekends in Southern Europe (~ 6% of difference). This study highlights the challenge of reducing the formation of secondary pollutants such as O 3 even with strict measures to control primary pollutant emissions. These results are relevant for designing abatement policies of urban pollution.",

Outdoor air pollution is a major global public health issue (Lelieveld et al., 2015) , leading to 4.2 million premature deaths worldwide in 2016 (WHO, 2019) . In cities, particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter lower than 2.5 \u00b5m and 10 \u00b5m (PM 2.5 and PM 10 ), nitrogen dioxide (NO 2 ) and tropospheric ozone (O 3 ) are among the most threatening air pollutants in terms of harmful effects on human health associated with respiratory and cardiovascular diseases and mortality (Weinmayr et al., 2010; Pascal et al., 2013; Stafoggia et al., 2013; Cohen et al., 2017; Nuvolone et al., 2018) . As a result, the legislated ambient air quality standards and the emission control policies around the world (e.g. World Health Organization Air Quality Guidelines, 2006; European Council Directive 2008 /50/EC, Ministry of Environmental Protection, 2012 National Emission Ceilings Directive, 2016 ; Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution, 2017) regulate air pollutants concentrations such as PM 2.5 , PM 10 , NO 2 and O 3 , by setting limit and target values, long-term objectives, information thresholds, and alert threshold values for the protection of human health (Table 1 ).",

In 2015, 47,300, 84,300 and 38,600 non-accidental premature deaths were attributed to air pollution (PM 2.5 , NO 2 , O 3 ) in France, Italy and Spain, respectively (EEA, 2018) . In 2016, the total number of premature deaths for non-accidental causes attributed to PM 2.5 and PM 10 (above 10 \u00b5g.m -3 ) and O 3 (above 20 \u00b5g.m -3 ) was 1800 in Rome and 144 in Nice . Moreover, in a study of nine European cities including Rome and Valencia, the percentage increase in all deaths from natural causes per \u2022C increase in air temperature tended to be greater during high O 3 days (Analitis et al., 2018) , suggesting interactions with climate change. Air pollution in China has been a rising threat to human health (Liu et al 2016; Feng et al., 2019) with annually about 2.5 million premature deaths attributed to air pollution (Lelieveld et al 2015) . Based on WHO metrics for human health protection, the O 3 levels led to 59,844 additional deaths in 2015 across China (Feng et al., 2019) . In Wuhan, a total of 19,948 deaths was attributed to PM 10 , NO 2 and SO 2 over the time period (Ren et al., 2017 .",

The objective was to estimate how different was a long and substantial reduction in activity in comparison with the reduced activity typical of the weekends. The non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test followed by a post-hoc test using the criterion Fisher's Least Significant Difference and p adjusted with the Holm correction was used to test for statistical significances between groups.

By investigating the lockdown effects on air quality in cities, we have a better understanding of contributions from sectoral emissions to air pollution, in particular the O 3 production, in order to formulate effective emission control policies. Among the dominant sectors contributing to air pollution in urban areas, the sectors \"transport\", \"industrial processes\" and \"commercial, institutional and households\" were strongly impacted by the lockdown measures in China, France, Italy and Spain.",

The lower reduction in Turin can be explained by a higher contribution of the \"industrial\" sector, where essential industrial activities (e.g. food, pharmaceutical) continued during the lockdown. Stronger reductions were observed at traffic stations for NO (~78%) and NO 2 (~65%), where the \"road transport\" sector is the largest contributor to NO x emissions. The magnitude of changes in NO 2 levels was similar between European cities (~52%) and Wuhan in China (57%), where automobile exhausts are the major source of NO x . As road and non-road transport were drastically reduced, the lockdown effect on NO x reduction was much higher than the weekend effect, with NO x concentrations during the lockdown on average 49% lower than on weekends at all stations, and 60% lower at traffic stations.",

Indeed, PM 2.5 and PM 10 concentrations decreased in Nice (3% and 6%) and Turin (13% and 9%) and increased in Rome (11% and 2%). Stronger reductions were observed in Valencia (13% and 32%). At traffic stations, the lockdown measures strongly decreased both PM 2.5 and PM 10 levels in Nice (8%), Rome (1-3%) and Valencia (29-51%). The observed decreases were due to the reduction of road and non-road transport, representing up to 15% of wintertime PM levels (Karamchandani et al., 2017) , and the reduction of fuel combustion in closed institutional and commercial buildings. However, this decrease was counter-balanced by a PM increase from domestic heating (\"requiring people to stay at home\") and garden activities (e.g. biomass burning). In Nice, and surrounding cities, the local authorities issued a regulation to drastically reduce the green waste burning. By comparing both the lockdown and weekend effects on PM levels at all stations, we showed that the lockdown had the same effect as weekends in Nice, Rome and Turin (~6% of difference). Such slight difference suggests that road traffic was not a large contributor to PM emissions but derived more from residential and tertiary sector in these cities. The citizens behave similarly during lockdown and weekends. The strong reductions in particles at traffic stations observed in Valencia during the lockdown resulted from a combination of factors: i) a higher baseline due to landscaping works in one of the traffic stations in previous years and ii) several rainy days (wash-out effect) during the lockdown period. A higher contribution of \"transport\" (road transport: 18%; non-road transport: 21%) to PM emissions, as reported in Barcelona (Karamchandani et al., 2017) , could also partly explain the largest reduction observed in Valencia. In Wuhan, the PM 2.5 and PM 10 decreases by 36% and 49% were higher than those observed in Southern Europe (~4% and ~11%, respectively). In Wuhan, the emissions from household heating and cooking activities (ab. 32%), coal consumption and heavy industries harboring iron and steel smelts (accounted for 34% of secondary PM and 57% of primary dust) were the largest contributors to PM 2.5 and PM 10 emissions compared with ab. 5% from the \"transport\" sector (Qian et al. 2007; Wang et al., 2017) . The lockdown had a higher effect than the weekends on PM reduction in Wuhan (~44% less), thus, the strong reduction can be attributed to the reduction of coal combustion in the tertiary sector and cessation of industrial activities.",

            "text": "During the lockdown 2020, the surface O 3 levels increased by 24-27% in Nice and Turin, by 14% in Rome and by 36% in Wuhan. The slight increase of O 3 levels in Valencia (2.4%) was mainly due to rainy and cloudy conditions (AEMET, 2020). In a recent paper, Tob\u00edas et al. (2020) reported an increase in O 3 of 29% at urban stations of Barcelona between February 16 th to March 13 th and March 14 th to 30 th , 2020. At city-scale, the O 3 formation depends on the VOC-NOx ratio (Pusede and Cohen, 2012) . The urban areas are characterized by a low ratio due to high NO x concentrations (Beekman and Vautard, 2010) . The local O 3 formation is generally limited by VOCs in Wuhan (Zeng et al., 2018) and in Southern Europe Sicard et al., 2020) . In this case, i.e. with \"VOC-limited\" conditions, a reduction in VOCs emission reduces the O 3 formation, but a reduction in NO x emission increases the O 3 formation. To effectively control O 3 pollution in Wuhan, the reduction ratio of VOCs to NO x concentrations should not be lower than 0.73 (Zeng et al., 2018) . The implementation of stringent lockdown measures produced more reduced NO x emissions than VOCs emissions in the investigated cities, leading to higher VOC-NO x ratio, which enhanced the O 3 production. During the lockdown, an increase in O 3 precursors emissions such as carbon monoxide (CO) and VOCs from home (e.g. cleaning, fireplaces) and garden activities (e.g. barbeques, biomass burning) may also have contributed to the O 3 increase (Coe et al., 2003; Murphy et al., 2007; Su et al., 2013; Wolff et al., 2013) .",

Generally, the lockdown effect on O 3 production was higher than O 3 weekend effect, mainly due to the longer period of NO x reduction. Furthermore, the average lifetime of O 3 in the troposphere is estimated at 20-24 days (Stevenson et al. 2006) .",

            "text": "Following the implementation of stringent lockdown measures in the framework of the COVID-19 pandemic, the reduction in road and non-road transport, non-essential businesses and industrial activities led to significant declines in NO x and PM concentrations, especially in Wuhan. The lockdown measures led to a reduction of NO x concentrations of ~56% due to the large reduction of the \"transport\" sector (e.g. 70% in France). During the lockdown, the PM levels slightly changed (< 10% of change). Indeed, the restrictive measures reduced emissions of PM 2.5 and PM 10 by road and non-road transport and by fuel combustion in institutional and commercial buildings, but these decreases were counter-balanced by an increase of PM emissions from the activities at home (e.g. domestic heating, biomass burning). Due to stringent lockdown measures, generally the near-surface O 3 increased by ~17% in Southern European cities and by 36% in Wuhan, i.e. similarly to the relative contribution of road traffic emissions to O 3 levels. The O 3 increase is due to a lower titration of O 3 by NO due to the strong reduction in local NO x emissions by road transport. Overall, the largest effect of the lockdown measures on concentrations of NO x , PM and O 3 came from the large reduction in road transport, as observed at traffic stations. The NO x reduction during J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f the lockdown was higher than the VOCs reduction. Similarly to the O 3 weekend effect, the main causes of the higher O 3 concentrations in cities during the lockdown, under VOClimited conditions, are: i) a reduction in NO x emissions from road traffic leading to a lower O 3 titration by NO (dominant cause); ii) as PM emissions were lower, the higher solar radiation favored O 3 formation; and iii) an increase of O 3 precursors emissions from home and garden activities.",

The unprecedented reduction in mobility and economic activity caused by the COVID-19 lockdown represents an exceptional opportunity for studying the contribution of different sources of primary pollutant and for understanding the changes in the atmospheric chemistry under conditions of reduced primary pollutant emissions in the cities. For secondary pollutants like O 3 , the lockdown has also shown that its reduction will remain challenging even with effective policies for reducing primary pollutants.
