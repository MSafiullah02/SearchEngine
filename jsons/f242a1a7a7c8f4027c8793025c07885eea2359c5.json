We describe two cases of COVID-19 treated with convalescent plasma infusion. Both patients presented severe pneumonia with acute respiratory distress syndrome and showed a favorable outcome after the use of convalescent plasma in addition to systemic corticosteroid. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the use of convalescent plasma therapy for COVID-19 in Korea.",

The World Health Organization announced the risk assessment of coronavirus disease 2019 as very high at the global level, and fatal cases are rapidly increasing. By March 24, 2020, more than 9,000 people were infected, and 126 people died, in South Korea. Without specific treatments for the virus, treatment options are being studied in addition to supportive care. Evidence shows that the use of convalescent plasma to treat emerging viral infections, including SARS, Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), Ebola virus disease or avian flu, can improve survival rates in patients whose condition worsens even with conventional treatment. 1,2 However, the safety and efficacy of convalescent plasma treatment in COVID- 19 have not been known. Here, we report two cases of severe COVID-19 patients presenting acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), who showed a favorable clinical course after the convalescent plasma infusion. This is the first report of the use of convalescent plasma to treat cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in Korea.",

Scientific evidence is insufficient due to the lack of large-scale clinical trials that may be representative of the target populations. Second, the number of antibodies administered to each patient was not standardized. Finally, convalescent plasma usually proceeds with other treatments, such as antiviral agents and steroids, which can affect the relationship between convalescent plasma and antibody, confounding the results.",

Also, when used with systemic corticosteroids, we might expect the possibility of reducing excessive inflammatory response by corticosteroids as well as promoting the reduction of viral loads by convalescent plasma simultaneously. Further well-designed studies are needed to demonstrate the efficacy and safety of convalescent plasma transfusion in COVID-19 patients.",
