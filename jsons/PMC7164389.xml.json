This period encompassed the 40 days of the Spring\nFestival holiday, 15 days before the Chinese Lunar New Year on 25 January and 25 days\nafterwards. The analysis is based on a unique geocoded repository of data on COVID-19\nepidemiology, human movement, and public health (non-pharmaceutical) interventions. These data\ninclude the numbers of COVID-19 cases reported each day in each city of China, information on\n4.3 million human movements from Wuhan city, and data on the timing and type of transmission\ncontrol measures implemented across cities of China.",

In\n2020, this travel was interrupted by the Wuhan city shutdown, but 4.3 million people travelled\nout of the city between 11 January and the implementation of the ban on 23 January (Fig. 2A) (7). In 2017 and 2018, travel out of the city during the 25 days\nafter the Chinese Lunar New Year averaged 6.7 million people each year.
