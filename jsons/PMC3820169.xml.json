Antibody detection by enzyme immunoassay (EIA) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays is enhanced by the use of analytic detectors, such as the spectrophotometer, fluorometer, luminometer, and radioactive counter. The specificity of antigen and antibody detection is increased by the use of monoclonal antibodies and recombinant antigens. Modern antibody panels can detect multiple antigens and/or antibodies or the presence of IgM or IgA antibodies within hours of specimen submission. Examples of antigen detection with specific antibody include rapid testing for Streptococcus pyogenes in the throat; cryptococcal antigen in blood and CSF; and detection of the antigens of Streptococcus pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1, and Histoplasma capsulatum in urine. These assays are more rapid than culture-based tests and do not require cultivation of viable organisms.

Newer automated tests using nanotechnology that no longer require addition of multiple reagents are being used for point-of-care diagnosis. The number of commercially available tests and their uses continue to increase logarithmically, and the cost of instruments and their assays continue to decrease.

Conventional methods are more readily replaced in virology than in bacteriology because the tissue culture\u2013based virology methods are costly and generally less sensitive than newer molecular methods. Some viruses are highly labile (eg, respiratory syncytial virus [RSV]), cannot be routinely cultured (eg, coronaviruses), or are dangerous to culture (eg, variola). Antiviral susceptibility testing is not routinely performed, but when it is needed, such as for the identification of ganciclovir-resistant CMV, mutations can be rapidly identified using nucleic acid amplification coupled with sequencing. In addition, FDA-cleared multiplex assays utilizing real-time amplification methods enable the simultaneous detection of multiple respiratory viruses, and research assays can detect the nucleic acid of viruses heretofore unrecognized and/or not cultivatable in vitro.",

Testing for high-risk HPV DNA is an established method for managing women with the cervical cytologic diagnosis of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance. Patients are referred for colposcopy based on the detection of high-risk types of HPV DNA. Similarly, CMV load testing can help distinguish between active disease and asymptomatic infection, as higher levels of CMV DNA increase the risk of active disease. Thus, CMV load measurement is useful for deciding when to initiate preemptive therapy in organ transplant recipients.

The presence of a CXCR4 tropic virus strain dramatically lowers the effectiveness of the drug. Hence, use of maraviroc and other entry inhibitors is encouraged by the FDA only in individuals who have been identified with the CCR5 HIV tropism.",

Studies of pan-bacterial PCR, for example, have been confounded by the presence of pathogen DNA contamination introduced at the time of specimen collection and/or preparation [28], and the turnaround time to results is lengthened by the need for DNA sequencing following nucleic acid amplification. A multiplex PCR panel, designed to directly detect and identify 25 of the most common bacterial and fungal causes of bloodstream infection within several hours, has been developed. Positive agreement between the commercial PCR and blood culture has ranged from 55% to 85% in nonneutropenic patients [29\u201335], illustrating that current molecular assays remain relatively insensitive compared to blood culture. Furthermore, the clinical significance of specimens positive only by PCR, with negative cultures for the same organism at other body sites, remains difficult to interpret, as standard NAAT testing does not differentiate viable from nonviable organisms. Multicenter clinical trials are necessary to define the diagnostic accuracy of molecular assays performed on blood, and more sensitive approaches are obviously needed.

Alternatively, management strategies predicated on microbiology are associated with less antibiotic usage in ICU patients and have the potential to improve patient outcomes [37, 38]. Lower respiratory tract specimens (eg, tracheal aspirate, bronchoalveolar lavage, or protected brush) are preferred for making a microbiologic diagnosis of HAP or VAP, but invasive sampling may not always be possible. Furthermore, positive Gram stain or culture from the lower respiratory tract does not always distinguish an invasive pathogen from airway colonization. Quantitative cultures of lower respiratory tract specimens have been advocated to improve diagnostic specificity; however, a recent Cochrane review concluded that quantitation did not improve outcomes for intubated patients as compared to those managed with qualitative results only [39].",

In terms of significant resource limitations, desirable diagnostic assays should require little to no power input (such as electricity) as well as minimal technical skill and training in both the operation and interpretation of the test. Portability should be high and storage requirements for specimens and reagents (such as cold chain) should be minimal. The instruments should be able to withstand temperature extremes and power surges (if electricity is required).

Today, molecular diagnostic testing has moved toward a more broad syndromic screening approach. This trend is the result of sophisticated technologies that enable the detection of >1 analyte at a time. Tests/devices vary from low multiplex (2\u20135 analytes) to 25 or more different analytes, often now combining a mixture of pathogen types, (eg, bacteria, viruses, and parasites), and also antibiotic resistance markers. New highly multiplexed cartridge-based systems can detect the majority of bacterial pathogens that cause community, ventilator-associated, and hospital-acquired pneumonia within 1\u20132 hours. In addition, these systems can detect >20 antibiotic resistance genetic markers. The intent is not to replace culture, as additional characterization of isolates still needs to be performed on cultured samples, but to provide a POC early diagnosis that can lead to more focused appropriate antimicrobial therapy. Other multiplex panels focus on pathogens found in patients with a clinical picture of septic shock or diarrhea caused by a gastrointestinal pathogen. Multiplexed enteric disease panels target common bacterial pathogens such as Salmonella, Shigella, Yersinia, Vibrio, and Campylobacter species, and in addition, bacterial toxins (eg, Shiga toxin), parasites (eg, Giardia), and viruses (eg, norovirus). The selection of assay analytes must be clinically relevant; more analytes is not always better and the testing expense may not be reimbursed. At least in the near term, multiplex amplification platforms will replace some activities (viral culture) but will supplement other testing (antibiotic in vitro susceptibility testing).",

New pathogens are identified (eg, MERS-CoV), variants of old pathogens emerge (eg, influenza A[H1N1]pdm09 and H7N9), and new antibiotic resistance mechanisms evolve (eg, K. pneumoniae carbapenemases and New Delhi metallo-\u03b2-lactamase-1). Hence, there is a strong indication for flexibility in test or instrument design. For example, multiplex systems involve complex primer and probe interactions during the initial or subsequent amplification and detection steps. The addition of new primers and probes to detect an additional target will require validation of the newly added target and demonstration that the performance for existing targets is not affected. The revalidation of all existing targets does not need to be undertaken again, and the experimental evidence required demonstrating performance is limited to key points that can be addressed through in-house studies. Furthermore, FDA encourages assay developers to archive specimens used during the clinical evaluation for future use, especially in cases where the multiplex panel is being expanded. These ideas can and have been applied to existing cleared multiplex devices to address detection of emerging and evolving pathogens; however, it is important to note that these mechanisms should not be used to inflate the assay menu of a device to increase marketability, but rather should be used to address true public health needs.",

Conversely, NGS requires extensive bioinformatics for data interpretation [58]. To meet the needs for routine clinical testing, compact NGS systems have been developed with a small footprint and fast turnaround time. Using these systems, sequencing could replace complex multifaceted traditional microbiological identification procedures such as biochemical testing, and sequencing could detect virulence determinants and the genetic markers of antimicrobial resistance. Sequencing, however, may miss new and uncharacterized genetic elements responsible for phenotypic resistance mechanisms. This will require companies to perform extensive phenotypic/genotypic comparisons and may in addition require gene expression analysis for detecting complex phenotypes (eg, changes in porin expression related to carbapenem resistance). Sequence data has already proved its value in tracking outbreaks of infection due to resistant bacteria (eg, the NIH outbreak of multidrug-resistant gram-negative bacteria [55] and the cholera outbreak in Haiti [50]). Future studies need to address the clinical relevance of finding a fragment of nucleic acid that may not correlate with the patient's clinical syndrome. Finally, NGS systems need easy, concise, low-cost data management and interpretation software and access to well-vetted databases. Only then will NGS systems become a primary diagnostics approach for infectious diseases. The development and implementation of standardized methods that allow for data sharing across institutions will be critical to the success of NGS as a public health tool for outbreak detection and response and surveillance.",

New MALDI-TOF MS platforms can be used routinely in clinical microbiology laboratories for the rapid identification of bacteria, fungi, mycobacteria, and parasites [59, 60]. MALDI-TOF MS testing is relatively simple and, for most bacteria, only requires transferring a portion of an isolated colony onto a well in a designated disposable or reusable target slide. Organisms such as mycobacteria and fungi usually require an additional pretreatment step to ensure nonviability of the organism before manipulation and extraction of the proteins of interest. The inoculated well is covered with a chemical matrix, generally \u03b1-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid, dried, and the target plate is loaded into the instrument. Vacuum is applied to the chamber and the target slide wells are pulsed by a laser, converting the sample into an ionic gas composed of small molecules, peptides, and small proteins. In the ionization chamber, positively charged molecules are accelerated through an electric field and then enter the time-of-flight mass analyzer. Smaller particles travel faster through the tube to the particle detector. The particle detector measures the flight times, which are converted into mass/velocity values and plotted on a mass spectrogram. The spectrogram is then compared to a validated library of spectrograms using proprietary algorithms specific to each manufacturer. Testing of calibrators and controls ensure the appropriate performance of the MALDI-TOF MS. The time to first result is approximately 10\u201320 minutes and each new subsequent result is available within 1 minute.",

These systems are also amenable to integration into automated platforms that can inoculate the MALDI-TOF MS slide and collate the MALDI-TOF MS identification with antimicrobial susceptibility data. The initial cost for the MALDI-TOF MS unit ranges from approximately $160 000 to $250 000, and the yearly maintenance costs roughly $35 000 a year. However, these expenses are offset by the low reagent cost per identification ($.10\u2013$.50) as compared to traditional microbiologic systems (approximately $2.50\u2013$5.00 per identification) plus savings in technical time (about 1 minute per identification) and the clinical benefit of providing an organism identification in about 20 minutes [57]. Currently, when a blood culture is flagged as positive for organism growth, laboratories generally report the results of a Gram stain and need an additional 24\u201348 hours or more for organism identification and susceptibility test results. Alternative technologies such as peptide nucleic acid fluorescence in situ hybridization and NAAT systems can provide identification of an organism and some susceptibility data within hours. However, these tests are currently limited by the number of pathogens detected, cost per test (on average $25\u2013$75) and, for some methods, technical time required to perform the testing. With MALDI-TOF MS, direct identification of virtually any organism from a positive blood culture broth is possible within 20 minutes at a cost of a few cents. Rapid pathogen identification has a major impact on the selection of antimicrobial therapy [61]. Preliminary studies demonstrate that MALDI-TOF MS can also detect certain types of antibiotic resistance mechanisms that result in structural modifications to the antibiotic [62]. For example, the hydrolysis of \u03b2-lactam drugs by bacterial \u03b2 -lactamase enzymes can be detected due to a mass shift in the size of the original compound upon hydrolysis [62]. This shift occurs within hours of exposure of the drug to the organism of interest. Resistance detection applications of MALDI-TOF MS are in the early stages of development. The ultimate goal is to couple rapid susceptibility testing with MALDI-TOF MS identification within 24\u201336 hours of receipt in the laboratory.",

The electrochemical-based sensing technique provided sufficient selectivity, sensitivity, and low-cost detection of nucleic acid sequences amplified from urine. To complement bacterial identification, a direct biosensor quantification of bacterial 16S RNA was developed to monitor bacterial growth for antibiotic susceptibility testing [66]. Additionally, differential impedance has been used for the direct detection of bacterial stress responses in contaminated platelet samples [67]. Low-cost power requirements, compatibility with different matrices, ease of use, and interpretation are essential for clinical applications. Ideally, biosensors would be able to detect the target of interest without an amplification step. This would require a means to enhance the capture of the target nucleic acids and/or proteins with sufficient efficiency for direct detection. Alternatively, a combination of direct nucleic acid and protein capture (pathogen or biomarker) might have the potential to achieve this goal.

When the laboratories of experts become inaccessible, companies are forced to engage laboratories lacking the specific expertise (eg, viral culture, or extraction of RNA from clinical samples) needed for evaluation of a new product, and must provide additional training. Finding or developing the necessary number of laboratories with the appropriate expertise to process the large number of samples needed for a clinical trial is a costly challenge, even if samples are sent to a central laboratory, which in some cases is not feasible. In one recent study, up to 12% of samples were either lost or destroyed during shipment to a central laboratory. In the 1980s, many clinical microbiology laboratories had research technologists whose job it was to oversee clinical trials of new diagnostic testing methods. Those research positions have long been eliminated due to financial constraints, thereby making clinical trials a burden to the existing laboratory staff. Thus, the number of microbiology laboratories willing to take part in clinical trials of new products has shrunk over the last decade, limited even further by conflict of interest rules, institutional regulations, and overhead costs, which now exceed 50% in some institutions, making contracts with those places too expensive to pursue.",

Examples of recent challenges include molecular diagnostic testing for viral respiratory pathogens and the importance of appropriate testing practices for C. difficile testing that exclude formed stool specimens to avoid overtreatment of colonization [76]. Recent changes and developments in rapid molecular tests have in many cases outpaced clinician awareness and uptake. Laboratorians can facilitate education of healthcare personnel in the scope of use of a diagnostic test, interpretation, and recommendations for repeated or follow-up testing through, for example, blogs of new assays, updated specimen collection guidelines, and presentations to key stakeholders. Infectious diseases clinicians serve as a critical liaison between healthcare providers and the clinical microbiology lab, and engaging their expertise will assist in determination of the best diagnostic test and interpretation of laboratory results, leading to improved patient care.",

It is important to consider the public health implications of these innovations as they are developed to ensure that there are no unintended negative effects on our capacity to identify, respond to, and track infectious public health threats.\n",

Congress must play a role in increasing funding for diagnostics research and enacting legislation that addresses identified challenges. Successful implementation of these recommendations will require a commitment from all stakeholders, and will open the door for remarkable progress in the field of diagnostics and resulting impact on many infectious diseases. As technologies advance, there is a critical window of time to harness and direct development of new diagnostics to benefit patients. The goal is not just to create more tests, but to develop rapid, reliable, accurate, simple tests that will reduce time to a diagnosis and truly improve the quality of care and patient outcomes while reducing healthcare costs.",
