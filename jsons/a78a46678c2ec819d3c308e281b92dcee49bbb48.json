            "text": "Background: Viral respiratory tract infections (RTI) are relatively understudied in Southeast Asian tropical countries. In temperate countries, seasonal activity of respiratory viruses has been reported, particularly in association with temperature, while inconsistent correlation of respiratory viral activity with humidity and rain is found in tropical countries. A retrospective study was performed from 1982-2008 to investigate the viral etiology of children (\u2264 5 years old) admitted with RTI in a tertiary hospital in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Methods: A total of 10269 respiratory samples from all children \u2264 5 years old received at the hospital's diagnostic virology laboratory between 1982-2008 were included in the study. Immunofluorescence staining (for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza A and B, parainfluenza types 1-3, and adenovirus) and virus isolation were performed. The yearly hospitalization rates and annual patterns of laboratory-confirmed viral RTIs were determined. Univariate ANOVA was used to analyse the demographic parameters of cases. Multiple regression and Spearman's rank correlation were used to analyse the correlation between RSV cases and meteorological parameters. Results: A total of 2708 cases were laboratory-confirmed using immunofluorescence assays and viral cultures, with the most commonly detected being RSV (1913, 70.6%), parainfluenza viruses (357, 13.2%), influenza viruses (297, 11.0%), and adenovirus (141, 5.2%). Children infected with RSV were significantly younger, and children infected with influenza viruses were significantly older. The four main viruses caused disease throughout the year, with a seasonal peak observed for RSV in September-December. Monthly RSV cases were directly correlated with rain days, and inversely correlated with relative humidity and temperature. Conclusion: Viral RTIs, particularly due to RSV, are commonly detected in respiratory samples from hospitalized children in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. As in temperate countries, RSV infection in tropical Malaysia also caused seasonal yearly epidemics, and this has implications for prophylaxis and vaccination programmes.",

RSV showed the most pronounced seasonality, with peak activity at the year-end (September-December), and lowest activity in mid-year (April-June).

Our laboratory does not routinely detect rhinoviruses, but RSV was the most frequently detected respiratory virus, particularly in infants less than one year old. This suggests that maternal antibodies were ineffective in preventing RSV infections. Older children may be less prone to RSV infection due to the maturity of their immune system or natural immunity obtained through repeated infections of RSV. The burden of RSV in young infants in tropical countries, including Malaysia, emphasizes the likely global benefits of developing a safe and effective vaccine for RSV. Our data also showed a slight male preponderance (59.8%) in children with respiratory viral infections, consistent with other studies [25] .",

In our study, the common respiratory viruses were detected throughout the year. The RSV annual epidemics are strongly seasonal, while seasonality is less clear for influenza, parainfluenza, and adenovirus, which may be due to the smaller number of cases. For adenovirus, most studies show sporadic occurrence without any seasonal trend [28, 29] . In the tropics, influenza occurs all year-round [29] , similar to our data. In Singapore, parainfluenza virus type 3 was the most commonly detected parainfluenza virus type, with seasonal peaks in February-March similar to our results [29] . In Kuala Lumpur, RSV peaks at the end of the year. In contrast, in neighbouring Singapore (latitude 1\u00b0N) and Lombok, Indonesia (latitude 8\u00b0S), RSV peaks around March-August [29, 30] . In most RSV studies carried out in temperate countries, where temperature varies widely between seasons, temperature is highly inversely correlated to RSV cases [4, 31] . We also found a negative correlation between RSV and temperature in tropical Kuala Lumpur, where the much reduced temperature variation may explain the weaker correlation (correlation coefficient of -0.116). As previously observed in Indonesia [32] , we also found that the number of rain days was significantly associated with RSV cases, but not rainfall. Malaysia experiences brief, intense showers of rainfall, as well as prolonged episodes of light rainfall. Therefore, the number of rain days may have a greater influence than the absolute amount of rainfall on behaviours such as children staying indoors, thus increasing close contact and indoor transmission of respiratory viruses [33] .",

We were unable to obtain dates of admission for the earlier patients, and thus could not differentiate between nosocomial and community-acquired viral infections. However, we have previously found that nosocomial cases made up 25/157 (15.9%) influenza cases from 2002-2007 [13] and 17/146 (11.6%) RSV cases from 1989-2010 (Khor CS, Sam IC and Chan YF, unpublished observations). These nosocomial rates of respiratory viral infections are similar to previously published rates of 12.1-13.8% [36, 37] , thus supporting the likelihood that the majority of infections seen in our study were community-acquired. Over 27 years, there may have been changes in physicians' practices, such as criteria for taking specimens and admitting patients, and types of samples collected. Furthermore, with a relatively low IF sensitivity of 55.8% using virus isolation as the gold standard, there is likely to be considerable underdiagnosis of viral infections compared to molecular methods [38] . Nevertheless, despite these limitations, these unusually extensive records kept over 27 years provide valuable insight into current and historical respiratory virus epidemiology in a tropical Southeast Asian country, particularly with the limited available facilities for virus diagnosis. To extend these findings, we are currently carrying out prospective studies using molecular methods to detect a wider range of respiratory viruses.",

Since the data variance is unequal, the Games-Howell test was selected as the post hoc test to compare cases with each virus type to the population separately. The seasonal trends for each respiratory virus were evaluated. As the number of RSV cases was highest, RSV activity was further analyzed to determine its associations with meteorological factors such as rain days, relative humidity, temperature, pressure, rainfall, and ultraviolet radiance. Meteorological data were provided by the Malaysian Meteorological Department, from two weather stations located in Petaling Jaya and Subang Jaya, about 5-15 km away from the hospital. The monthly data from both stations were averaged before correlation with monthly RSV cases. Spearman's rank correlation and stepwise multiple regression analysis and were performed with RSV cases as the dependant variable, and the climatic factors as independent variables. A p value of < 0.05 was considered significant. The smaller numbers of cases precluded similar analyses for the other respiratory viruses.",

The decision to admit children and take respiratory samples was made at the discretion of the attending physician. Most (> 90%) of the respiratory samples received were nasopharyngeal secretions or aspirates, with other specimen types including bronchoalveolar lavages, oropharyngeal secretions, nasal swabs, tracheal secretions, throat swabs, and sputum. Duplicate positive samples collected from the same patient within a week were removed from analysis. As all other samples received were analysed, regardless of the timing during admission, nosocomial infections cannot be excluded. Co-infections were counted as separate cases. Ethics approval was obtained from the Medical Ethics Committee of University Malaya Medical Centre (reference number: 788.3).All respiratory samples were routinely screened for respiratory viruses by direct IF and viral isolation. Cells obtained by centrifuging clinical samples were fixed onto slides, and IF for the common respiratory viruses (influenza A and B, parainfluenza 1, 2, and 3, RSV, and adenovirus) was performed using Light Diagnostic Respiratory Panel 1 Viral Screening & Identification Kit (Millipore, Billerica, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Viral isolation was performed by inoculating the respiratory samples into Madin Darby canine kidney (MDCK; ATCC number CCL-34), Vero (ATCC number CCL-81), A549 (ATCC number CCL-185), and HEp-2 (ATCC number CCL-23) cells, and incubated at 32\u00b0C with 5% CO 2 . Infected cells were monitored daily for up to 10 days, and those showing cytopathic effect (CPE) were harvested for IF. For samples with no CPE after ten days, haemadsorption with human type O blood was performed on MDCK cells to detect influenza viruses. A laboratoryconfirmed or positive case of respiratory virus infection was defined as a case with positive IF and/or virus isolation.",
