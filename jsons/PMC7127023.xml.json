Respiratory syncytial virus has become increasingly recognized globally as an important viral pathogen in young children through the widespread use of RSV-specific rapid diagnostic tests, such as antigen enzyme immunoassay detection and direct fluorescent antibody (FA) detection (Piedra et al., 2002). However, rapid diagnostic tests are not widely used for the detection of newly recognized viruses such as hMPV (van Burik, 2006), coronavirus (Fouchier et al., 2004, van der Hoek et al., 2004, Woo et al., 2005), and bocavirus (Allander et al., 2005). This has led to the increasing use of sensitive viral detection methods such as reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for the diagnosis of viral respiratory pathogens.",

Good correlation of viral load as determined by plaque assays on fresh aliquots and RT-PCR has also been demonstrated (Perkins et al., 2005), an important finding in light of the technical difficulties of plaque assays and the potential interference of neutralization or inactivation of virus by antibodies or antiviral agents. Molecular quantitative assays for pathogenic respiratory viruses have been advocated for the detection and monitoring of clinical disease, particularly in immunosuppressed pediatric patients (Watzinger et al., 2004), and RT-PCR lends itself to the quantification of viral load from a variety of clinical specimens, including nasal wash, endotracheal aspirate, and bronchoalveolar lavage.",

This pattern was not observed among children infected only with RSV. Importantly, clinically significant illness was observed in children with fewer than 1 \u00d7 105 copies/mL with both hMPV and RSV infections.

Critically ill adult bone marrow transplant recipients have been shown to have severe disease with low viral loads, as assessed by plaque assays (Englund et al., 1996). Bennett et al. (2007) have found that RSV viral load by plaque assay was significantly correlated with cytokine levels of interleukin (IL)-8 and IL-10. Increased levels of IL-10 were, in turn, significantly inversely associated with the duration of supplemental oxygen requirement. In a study of 77 infants younger than 2 years conducted by Wright et al. (2002), illness severity (measured by respiratory illness scoring and duration of supplemental oxygen and ventilatory support) was correlated with younger age but not with RSV quantity determined by plaque assays on fresh nasal wash specimens. In another study of 141 untreated infants younger than 2 years, a higher RSV load in the nasal wash at admission, measured by fresh culture, was independently associated with longer hospitalization, respiratory failure, and need for intensive care, controlling for age among other subject characteristics (DeVincenzo et al., 2005). These differences in findings may be due to characteristics other than age that may differ between the 2 populations studied. In the study by Wright et al., more than half of the infants (n = 44) had bronchopulmonary dysplasia or congenital heart disease, 2 conditions which were among the exclusion criteria for the study by DeVincenzo et al. For this reason, the populations used in the 2 studies are not directly comparable. Further differences in definitions of severity and the statistical methods used may also have contributed to the noncomparability of these 2 studies' results. Although we included children with underlying chronic conditions, similar to the Wright et al. study, we were able to control for this factor in a multivariate analysis, leading to some results that demonstrate that viral load may correlate inversely with some markers of RSV disease severity including inpatient admissions, use of antibiotics, and respiratory rate.",

We attribute the decreased antibiotic use to timely notification of a laboratory diagnosis to the prescribing physician. No similar association between antibiotic use and hMPV viral load was present, presumably because no rapid test was then available at our hospital for hMPV.

The increased sensitivity of RT-PCR RSV tests in comparison to FA testing has lead to speculation that the presence of virus as detected by PCR may not be truly indicative of viral causality (Gerna et al., 2008). This is in contrast to studies using plaque reduction assays and PCR that demonstrated clinically significant disease at all detectable levels of virus (Buckingham et al., 2000, Wright et al., 2002).
