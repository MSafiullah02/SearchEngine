A week later, Carlo Urbani (Reilley et al., 2003), an Italian infectious disease expert working in the Hanoi, Vietnam, office of the WHO, responded to a possible avian influenza alert from French Hospital. That action by one man set into motion the engagement of the WHO, emergency measures by the Vietnamese government, and eventually the attention of the world. In Geneva, WHO team member Klaus St\u00f6hr (Stafford, 2005) put together and maintained a network of 11 microbiology laboratories in nine countries to respond to the epidemic and to identify the etiologic agent (Anon., 2003b).",

Early candidate agents suggested were a paramyxovirus and a coronavirus, as well as the bacterial agent Chlamydia pneumoniae (Stadler et al., 2003). In the last week of March 2003, laboratories in Hong Kong (China), the United States, and Germany isolated a novel coronavirus from clinical material obtained from patients with SARS (Drosten et al., 2003a; Ksiazek et al., 2003; Peiris et al., 2003b). Serological studies and RT-PCR specific for this coronavirus (subsequently called SARS-CoV) were positive in most \u201cprobable\u201d SARS patients but not in controls. RT-PCR products of several specimens from different geographical locations had identical nucleotide sequences, supporting the existence of a point-source outbreak. No other potential agent was consistently identified.",

The CDC workers were the first to visualize the characteristic morphology of SARS-CoV in infected cells and in culture supernatant using transmission electron microscopy with negative staining (Fig. 1\n), which they shared with the network laboratories within 24 h (Anderson, 2005). With that information, the CDC successfully probed the virus with group I coronavirus polyclonal antibodies, and employed primers [IN-2(+), IN-4(\u2212)] that targeted a conserved region of the coronavirus polymerase gene (open reading frame [ORF] 1b), thus amplifying the corresponding genomic region of SARS-CoV (Rota et al., 2003). Microarray hybridization further confirmed that the agent was a coronavirus. In Hong Kong, differential display priming (between SARS-CoV infected and uninfected cell cultures) and cloning were used to show that the virus was a coronavirus (Peiris et al., 2003b). German researchers performed random priming utilizing degenerate bases followed by sequencing and translated BLAST search to identify the RT-PCR products as those of a coronavirus (Drosten et al., 2003a).",

Macaque monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) developed a SARS-like illness after experimental infection, yielded the same virus inoculated, and developed a specific antibody response (Fouchier et al., 2003; Kuiken et al., 2003). Co-infection of macaques with human metapneumovirus (hMPV), a virus that had earlier been a candidate agent for the cause of SARS, was not associated with more severe illness (Fouchier et al., 2003). hMPV infection without SARS-CoV caused only minor upper respiratory illness in adults (Ksiazek et al., 2003), although hMPV alone can cause severe pneumonia in young children (van den Hoogen et al., 2001). SARS-CoV was deemed necessary and sufficient to cause SARS.",

Yi Guan and others investigated food markets in Guangdong, where a variety of small animals were kept in unhygienic heaped-up cages prior to sale (Guan et al., 2003). SARS-CoV-like coronaviruses were promptly identified in several Himalayan palm civets (Paguma larvata) and one raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides). Antibodies against SARS-CoV were also found in market workers. The relationship between these isolates from animals and isolates from humans appeared to be the result of a one-way transmission from animals to humans, because a 29-nucleotide deletion was found in the strain of SARS-CoV isolated from humans compared with civet SARS-CoV (it is easier to lose nucleotides than to gain some) (Chinese, 2004; Kan et al., 2005; Song et al., 2005b). Genomic comparisons further suggested that SARS-CoV was unlikely to be a recombinant between human and animal coronaviruses or between various animal coronaviruses, ruling out natural or laboratory chimerism (Holmes and Rambaut, 2004). Thus, SARS-CoV was probably a zoonotic virus (Holmes, 2003; Zhong et al., 2003b). It was also found that civets make a good amplification reservoir because SARS-CoV genomic RNA persisted in the spleen and lymph nodes of civets for as long as 35 days (Wu et al., 2005b).",

Bat-SARS-CoV, found in the insectivorous Chinese horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus sinicus), is nearly identical to civet SARS-CoV, including preservation of a 29-nucleotide segment not found in the majority of human isolates of SARS-CoV. Also nearly identical to civet SARS-CoV is SL-CoV Rp3, and perhaps related strains Rp1 and Rp2, found in Rhinolophus pearsoni by Li et al. (2005d). Shi, Zhang, and Wang's Sino-Australian cooperative effort, also involving Hong Kong University, produced proof that the bat is the natural reservoir for the SARS-CoV-like coronaviruses. These findings will lead to vaccines and drug treatments for SARS (Dobson, 2005).",

In this reemergence, four people developed SARS and were confirmed to have SARS-CoV by RT-PCR. Three had had direct or indirect contact with palm civets, and one lived near a hospital that earlier admitted many patients with SARS. All recovered and seroconverted. Amplified sequences of the viruses isolated from them were very similar to those of SARS-CoV found in the preceding winter in caged animals (Chinese, 2004; Song et al., 2005b). The one patient in the reemergent outbreak who had had no contact with civets had earlier disposed of a dead rat, leading health officials of Guangdong to trap rodents near his residence; some of the rats (Rattus rattus) were found to have SARS-CoV in feces and lung tissue (http://www.egms.de/en/meetings/sars2004/04sars023.shtml), though not overtly ill.",

Viruses in groups 1 and 2 are mammalian viruses; group 3 contains only avian viruses. Human coronaviruses (HCoV) are found in both group 1 (HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63) and group 2 (HCoV-OC43 and CoV-HKU1) and are responsible for 30% or more of generally mild upper respiratory tract illnesses. To position SARS-CoV, Snijder et al. used a rooted phylogenetic tree that included an outgroup, the equine torovirus (EToV) (Snijder et al., 2003). They concluded that SARS-CoV is distantly related to established group 2 coronaviruses, agreeing with Peiris's phylogenetic analysis using the polymerase gene (Peiris et al., 2003b). Most of the genome of SARS-CoV is closely related to group 2 coronaviruses (Magiorkinis et al., 2004). Now SARS-CoV is placed in a new subgroup 2b, with the other group 2 coronaviruses assigned to a new subgroup 2a (Stadler et al., 2003; Gorbalenya et al., 2004). In addition, bat-SARS-CoV was assigned recently to subgroup 2b (Lau et al., 2005).",

Like other coronaviruses and many other viruses, the strategy used for translation of pp1ab requires a \u201cslippery sequence\u201d and a structural mRNA element known as a pseudoknot, which causes a 1-ribosomal frameshift just 5\u2032 of the termination codon of ORF1a. The \u201cslippery sequence\u201d is highly conserved and would not function if mutated (Thiel et al., 2003). Another in cis element has been discovered, an attenuator 5\u2032 of the slippery sequence that downregulates 1 frameshift efficiency (Su et al., 2005). Transcription attenuation was thought to enable SARS-CoV to synthesize both full-length and subgenomic-length antisense RNA intermediates (Yount et al., 2005).",

Nsp2 is not essential for viral replication in Vero cells (Graham et al., 2005), which are defective in interferon (IFN) production (Emeny and Morgan, 1979). The two viral proteases, a very specific papain-like cysteine proteinase (nsp3, PL2pro; SARS-CoV does not have PL1pro), and the main chymotrypsin-like protease (nsp5), also known as 3C-like cysteine proteinase (3CLpro), with substrate specificity conserved among coronaviruses, are necessary for co- and post-translational processing of the polyprotein. PL2pro cleaves nsp1, nsp2, and nsp3 from the elongating polypeptide co-translationally, whereas 3CLpro is responsible for the other cleavage sites. The X-domain of nsp3 is homologous to adenosine diphosphate-ribose 1\u2032-phosphatase (ADRP), which is involved in pre-tRNA splicing (Snijder et al., 2003). Its phosphatase activity was recently demonstrated in in vitro assays (Saikatendu et al., 2005). Nsp4 is a hydrophobic protein of 35 kDa on SDS-polyacrylamide gel but has a predicted mass of 55 kDa. It is similar to MP1 of murine hepatitis virus (MHV) (Prentice et al., 2004). The use of \u201cartificial neural networks\u201d and SPAAN, a bioinformatics software that has a track record of discovering adhesins, has led to the finding of adhesin-like characteristics in nsp6, a function also ascribed to spike, nsp2, nsp5, and nsp7 (Sachdeva et al., 2005). Nsp7 and nsp8 assemble into a cylindrical hexadecamer with inner positive charges and an internal diameter of 30 \u00c5, thought to confer processivity to RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) (Zhai et al., 2005). Other scientists have cloned nsp9, expressed it in E. coli, crystallized it, and generated crystallographic data in an effort to facilitate drug design (Campanacci et al., 2003). They further showed that it is a single-stranded RNA-binding protein displaying an oligosaccharide/oligonucleotide fold unique to the world of RNA viruses (Egloff et al., 2004). Nsp12 functions as SARS-CoV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp or POL). Nsp13 is a promiscuous helicase (unwinds RNA and DNA) with ATPase activity belonging to the helicase superfamily 1 (Thiel et al., 2003).",

The N-terminal domain of nsp 14 is homologous to 3\u2032\u20135\u2032 exonulcease (ExoN) and it has been speculated that it may perform functions such as RNA proofreading, repair, and/or recombination (Snijder et al., 2003). That SARS-CoV has this genome protection capability may explain the slow estimated mutation rate (Chinese, 2004; Vega et al., 2004; Yeh et al., 2004), the sequence identity between a laboratory-acquired case and a stable laboratory isolate (Vega et al., 2004), and the observed but unexpected resistance to ribavirin, a drug that predisposes other RNA viruses to go into \u201cerror catastrophe\u201d (Eigen, 1987; Crotty et al., 2001; Pariente et al., 2001). Nevertheless, preliminary observations suggest that quasispecies do occur with SARS-CoV just as with other RNA viruses, although all patients studied for quasispecies existence had all received ribavirin (Xu et al., 2004a, Xu et al., 2004b), a confounding factor in the experiments.",

The cap is recognized by eukaryotic initiation factor eIF4F, which together with other initiation factors, recruit the 43S ribosomal subunit initiation complex that then scans the mRNA for the initiation codon AUG, whereupon the 60S ribosomal subunit docks and begins peptide elongation (Wang et al., 1997).

Also like other coronaviruses, all of the subgenomic mRNAs can be lined-up with the genomeat (are co-terminal with) the 3\u2032 end of the virus. The 5\u2032 ends are also identical. A minimal consensus sequence at the 5\u2032 end, 5\u2032ACGAAC-3\u2032, is sufficient to direct the synthesis of the subgenomic mRNAs (Thiel et al., 2003). This sequence, embedded in a stretch of nucleotides upstream of the ORF(s) of each subgenomic mRNA, is the result of fusion of nucleotides 1\u201372 of the genome (\u201cleader\u201d transcription regulatory sequence [TRS]) and a unique \u201cbody\u201d TRS preceding each ORF. The joining of these two regions is probably achieved in a discontinuous step during minus-strand synthesis (Stadler et al., 2003; Thiel et al., 2003).

Civet ACE2 (cACE2) differs from human ACE2 (hACE2), to which human isolates of SARS-CoV are not fully adapted, as shown by increased binding and infection by introduction of residues 90\u201393 of cACE2 into the human receptor (Li et al., 2005e).

The avidity of binding (Li et al., 2005e), viral entry (Yi et al., 2005), and immunogenicity (Yi et al., 2005) are affected by single amino acid substitutions within this region, as demonstrated at 2.9 \u00c5 resolution (Holmes, 2005; Li et al., 2005b). Binding is by way of conformational and electrostatic interactions (Yi et al., 2005). The strength differs, depending on the viral strain. Civet S binds cACE2 avidly but hACE2 poorly, although S from human isolates of SARS-CoV binds strongly with both cACE2 and hACE2 (Li et al., 2005e). Two regions of the S-protein-binding site on ACE2, and two residues (aa479 and aa487) in the receptor-binding region of S, largely determine the difference. S from human isolates of SARS-CoV has a small neutral residue (asparagine) at position 479, replacing a basic residue in civet S, and better accommodates the lysine at position 31 of hACE2. At position 487, serine in civet S is replaced by threonine, which has an extra methyl group, in the human isolates. This residue was absolutely conserved in S evaluated in >100 isolates during the epidemic (Li et al., 2005e). These findings suggest that adaptation of S to hACE2 was critical to viral adaptation to humans (Ruan et al., 2003).",

Systematic deletions of 5 of 8 group-specific ORFs, ORF3a, OF3b, ORF6, ORF7a, and ORF7b, alone or in combinations, did not significantly impair viral viability in cell culture and in mice (Yount et al., 2005). It is possible that they are involved in the struggle between the virus and its natural host, the bat. Deletion of group-specific ORFs from other coronaviruses often leads to attenuation in vivo (Yount et al., 2005). Evidence is emerging that some of these deletions might be pathogenic in man. ORF3a [3] and ORF3b [4] encode U274 (sars3a) and U154 (sars3b), respectively, two novel proteins not found in other coronaviruses (Tan et al., 2004b; Yu et al., 2004a; Ito et al., 2005). Both are implicated in triggering apoptosis (Law et al., 2005b; Yuan et al., 2005). U274 (sars3a) co-localizes with S and M and is packaged into virions (Ito et al., 2005). U122 (sars7a) encoded by ORF7a [8] (Snijder et al., 2003) is also localized to the rough endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi compartment. It has been reported to induce apoptosis by a caspase-dependent mechanism (Tan et al., 2004a). It is tempting to associate these apoptosis-inducing activities with lymphopenia, in a \u201cTrojan horse\u201d role. Infection of lymphocytes by SARS-CoV might be needed for survival (Gu et al., 2005); by causing lymphocyte apoptosis, virus with these deletions might permit survival of the virus in other cells that would otherwise be destroyed by the lymphocytes.",

Another cellular signaling pathway affected is the activation of AP-1 by S and N (He et al., 2003; Chang et al., 2004). N protein activates nuclear factor (NF)-kB in Vero E6 cells but not Vero cells, HeLa cells, or lung epithelial and fibroblast cell lines (Chang et al., 2004; Liao et al., 2005b). Other viruses that activate NF-kB include HIV-1, human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1, herpes viruses, hepatitis C virus, hepatitis B virus, and influenza viruses, among others (Santoro et al., 2003). The protean roles of NF-kB in inflammation, cell proliferation, cell survival, apoptosis, and as a central regulator of innate and adaptive immune responses, make it an ideal intracellular target for the virus.",

Vero cells stably expressing MxA (Samuel, 2001), a broad-spectrum anti-RNA virus large GTPase protein induced by IFNs \u03b1 and \u03b2 (but not \u03b3), continue to produce the virus, suggesting that SARS-CoV has countermeasures against this important defense mechanism (Spiegel et al., 2004). The adaptive immune system is itself a viral target; direct viral infection of CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes (Gu et al., 2005), induction of lymphocyte apoptosis (Chen et al., 2005a), and the multiple toxic viral molecules that can cause apoptosis, namely E protein (Yang et al., 2005b), U274 (Law et al., 2005b), U154 (Yuan et al., 2005), U122 (Tan et al., 2004a), and S (Chow et al., 2005). Harnessing the power of computational biology, scientists at the Beijing Genomics Institute are investigating viral virulence and evasion strategies by comparing SARS-CoV protein motifs with those of known human proteins and other viral proteins. Toxic motifs were found to be localized to various SARS-CoV proteins potentially relevant for therapy and vaccine design (Li et al., 2004b). For example, superantigen-like motifs in the S, E, N, and some accessory proteins are thought to cause lymphocyte apoptosis by activation in the absence of appropriate co-stimulatory signals. An enterotoxin motif in S could account for the diarrhea seen in many SARS victims.",

            "text": "The Chinese SARS Molecular Epidemiology Consortium collected spatially and temporally diverse specimens from humans and animals to study SARS-CoV evolution (Chinese, 2004). Several major SARS-CoV genotypes and 299 single-nucleotide variations (SNVs) were discovered among 63 sequences studied. Certain SNVs, for example, the second and third nucleotides of codon 479 of S (22927 and 22928) created the so-called multiple substitution codons, which have a chance occurrence of zero, pointing toward their development by natural selection. Another observation was the phenomenon of G+C enrichment (Song et al., 2005b), thought to be metabolically expensive for intracellular pathogens (Rocha and Danchin, 2002), but which also could be due to pressure from host sabotage akin to G\u2192T editing by host APOBEC3 family proteins, again suggesting adaptive pressure rather than random mutations. Genotyping based on SNVs in 5 loci (17564, 21721, 22222, 23823, and 27827) defined civet SARS-CoV (GACGC), an early GACTC motif in human isolates of SARS-CoV, GGCTC, or GATTC motifs in the middle of the epidemic, and a late TGTTT motif that has corresponding non-synonymous changes in ORF1b, S and the non-coding X3 (ORF6 or ORF7) regions (Liu, 2005). Similar changes occurred in the evolution of the three most significantly variable proteins S, sars3a (U274), and nsp3 (PL2pro), as the virus adapted to humans (Kan et al., 2005; Song et al., 2005b). Sequence deletions were observed in the dominant human strain, including entire ORFs specifying group-specific accessory proteins, such as a 29-nucleotide deletion in the ORF8 of civet SARS-CoV, creating ORF8a and ORF8b. An uncommon strain with limited range isolated early in the epidemic had an 82-nucleotide deletion in ORF8a, similar to animal SARS-CoV isolated in farmed civets in Hubei province, China (Chinese, 2004). Yet another strain isolated late in the epidemic in Hong Kong in May 2003 lacked a 415-nucleotide sequence corresponding to the entire ORF8a and ORF8b (Poon et al., 2004a).",

This slowed in the middle of the epidemic, with late changes producing strong purifying selection (Chinese, 2004; Yeh et al., 2004; Kan et al., 2005). These investigations also revealed that critical viral adaptations to humans went down the same evolutionary path in Beijing as earlier in Guangzhou, with a switch from the GGCTC to the TGTTT motif in patients belonging to the same cluster (Liu, 2005). Some of these molecular events occurred again in the late 2003 to early 2004 outbreak in Guangzhou (Kan et al., 2005; Song et al., 2005b). Throughout this period, civet SARS-CoV had been evolving and adapting to civet cats, producing a higher viral load, confirming that the civet is not its normal reservoir (Song et al., 2005b). However, given the opportunity, it appeared that SARS-CoV could establish a reservoir in farmed civets. These findings and the elucidation of the adaptation of S to hACE2 sharpen our perception of molecular emergence.",

Scientists at the Chinese University of Hong Kong have developed an allelic discrimination genotyping assay using 5\u2032 nuclease probes that has been validated for discriminating between human and animal strains of SARS-CoV, by comparison with direct sequencing (Chung et al., 2005).",

Tears (Loon et al., 2004; Tong and Lai, 2005) and sweat (Ding et al., 2004) have also been found to contain SARS-CoV RNA, although their role in disease transmission is unknown. Coughing as a means of airborne dissemination was difficult to prove (Seto et al., 2003; Tong, 2003), but was demonstrated experimentally (Booth et al., 2005). Large droplets emitted by coughing and sneezing and having a projection range of 1 m are believed to have contributed to airborne transmission (Fowler et al., 2004; Yu et al., 2004b, Yu et al., 2005; Booth et al., 2005; Li et al., 2005f, Li et al., 2005g; Tong, 2005a), possibly by superspreaders (Edwards et al., 2004); inadvertent aerosolization of other infected body materials or feces is also thought to be a possible means of transmission (Yu and Sung, 2004; Yu et al., 2004b). Fecal-to-oral transmission has not been documented, although viral nucleic acid has been found in sewage (Wang et al., 2005a). Nuclei acid testing by RT-PCR, if instituted, theoretically could prevent transfusion-associated transmission during future epidemics if SARS-Cov is shown to be present in blood from asymptomatic persons (Schmidt et al., 2004).",

The prodrome consists of flu-like symptoms such as malaise, myalgia, headache, fever, and rigors. Cough as an initial symptom is present in greater than half of the patients. Coryza and sore throat are present in a minority of cases. By day 5 (range, 3\u20137 days), up to 76% of patients develop exertional dyspnea; chest X-rays reveal opacities in the lungs of almost all patients, consistent with alveolar and interstitial exudation (Zhong et al., 2003b). This phase lasts for up to a week. Watery diarrhea developed in 20.4% of patients admitted to Princess Margaret Hospital, Hong Kong (Kwan et al., 2005a). A higher incidence of diarrhea was found in the cohort of patients from the Amoy Gardens (74%) and correlated with higher viral load in stool (Hung et al., 2004).",

However, induction of an immune response by viral proteins is also implicated in the pathogenesis. For example, the N-terminal aa324\u2013488 and the C-terminal aa609\u2013688 of S activate AP-1 and MAPKs independent of NF-kB in lung epithelial cells, monocytes, and fibroblasts in vitro leading to induction of IL-8 (Chang et al., 2004), consistent with observations that IL-8 and IL-2 levels are elevated in patients with SARS (Lee et al., 2004). In turn, IL-8 recruits neutrophils to the lungs, thereby facilitating SARS-CoV entry into pneumocytes by elaboration of proteases (Chang et al., 2004; Wong et al., 2004a; Matsuyama et al., 2005; Tang et al., 2005).",

            "text": "Host factors appear also to contribute to diffuse alveolar damage. The peptide hormone angiotensin II, positively and negatively regulated by ACE (product of ACE1 gene) and ACE2, respectively, has been shown to participate in spike-induced diffuse alveolar damage in mice (Imai et al., 2005; Kuba et al., 2005; Nicholls and Peiris, 2005). This explains why SARS patients carrying the D allele (deletion involving intron 16) polymorphism of the ACE1 gene, which is associated with higher level of sACE, are more prone to hypoxemia (Itoyama et al., 2004). The D allele, by increasing sACE, results in higher angiotensin II levels and hence susceptibility to injury by SARS-CoV S. ACE2 is protective by inactivating angiotensin II (Imai et al., 2005; Nicholls and Peiris, 2005). Interrupting the renin\u2013angiotensin system protected mice from exacerbation of lung injury aggravated by injection of S (Kuba et al., 2005). These studies showed how viral proteins can tip the balance in normal physiology and cause disease. The therapeutic implications for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), beyond the respiratory damage caused by SARS-CoV, was noted, but an explanation is needed for the generally mild infections of HCoV-NL63, which also utilizes ACE2 (Nicholls and Peiris, 2005). Perhaps the similarity is limited between human and murine pathophysiology in this infection.",

They found that cultured macrophages were infected (as evidenced by translated N protein) but not supportive of SARS-CoV replication. In addition, whereas macrophages infected by HCoV-229E and influenza A (H1N1) produce IFN-\u03b2, there is no evidence of induction of IFN-\u03b2 in SARS-CoV-infected macrophages. Instead, there is elaboration of chemokines CXCL10/IFN-inducible protein 10 (IP-10) and CCL2/monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1), possibly explaining aspects of the pathogenesis.",

When healing begins, it is accompanied by squamous metaplasia (Franks et al., 2003) and fibrosis in some patients.

Evidence of systemic vasculitis was reported in patients who died in a Chinese hospital (Ding et al., 2003). Recently, immune-mediated orchitis was described in men who died from SARS. Unlike mumps orchitis, which is usually (but not always) unilateral, the involvement was bilateral and appeared to target the germ cells, with the possibility of reduced fertility in men who recovered from the infection (Xu et al., 2005).",

They further investigated 569 SARS patients and demonstrated significantly lower serum levels of MBL and a significant prevalence of low-secretor genetic polymorphism than in 1188 controls. Similar conclusions were drawn in a genetic association study in northern China involving 352 SARS patients and 392 control subjects. Reduced expression of functional MBL was attributed to the codon 54 variant (Zhang et al., 2005b). Leikins et al. showed that the \u03b8-defensin retrocyclin 2 inhibits influenza virus entry into cells by cross-linking surface glycoprotein and that the related MBL and human \u03b2-defensin 3 similarly inhibited the step that precedes viral entry (Leikina et al., 2005).",

These diagnostic tests were important because viral culture was only available in a few BSL3 laboratories. RT-PCR was developed as soon as SARS-CoV was identified (Drosten et al., 2003a; Ksiazek et al., 2003; Peiris et al., 2003b). At the same time, real-time quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR (qRT-PCR) assays using intercalating dye, or in conjunction with single or, later, dual TaqMan probes, resulted in a significant increase in sensitivity and throughput compared to conventional RT-PCR (Drosten et al., 2003a; Poon et al., 2003; Jiang et al., 2004; Poon et al., 2004b; Yip et al., 2005). WHO network laboratories made available various primers and protocols for these tests (http://www.who.int/csr/sars/primers/en/index.html). Specimens from the upper respiratory tract, sputum, blood, stool, and urine have all yielded viral nucleic acid at various stages of the illness (Grant et al., 2003; Ng et al., 2003; Tong et al., 2003; Chan et al., 2004d; Hung et al., 2004; Ng et al., 2004). Viral load data generated from qRT-PCR were later shown to correlate with outcome (Chu et al., 2004c; Hung et al., 2004). For laboratories with fewer resources and those concerned about the shelf life of diagnostic kits, a highly sensitive gel-based RT-PCR protocol targeting the proteinase gene has been useful (Inoue et al., 2005).",

Peiris, Ksiazek, and Drosten used indirect fluorescence antibody (IFA) and cell culture extract-based ELISA assays to demonstrate seroconversion and a progressive increase in antibody titers in SARS (Drosten et al., 2003a; Ksiazek et al., 2003; Peiris et al., 2003b). IFA is specific (Chan et al., 2004c), but labor intensive and has an additional theoretical risk because virus-infected cells are used on the microscopic slides. ELISA assays using Vero cell extracts may yield false-positive results because of autoantibodies in patients with autoimmune disorders as well as in some normal subjects (Wang et al., 2004b). Recombinant N-based ELISA tests (Woo et al., 2004b) have cross-reacted with other HCoV. Protein immunoblotting against N and S could be used in conjunction with these other assays by identifying the false-positive results (Woo et al., 2004a). Recently, Chan et al. showed that SARS-CoV induces an anamnestic response to HCoV OC43, 229E, and NL63, demanding care in the interpretation of serological findings (Chan et al., 2005a).",

The results were similar in a subset of those patients reported separately (Chu et al., 2004a). These clinical trials are in agreement with structural studies that predicted the utility of lopinavir, ritonavir, niclosamide, and promazine against 3CL pro (Zhang and Yap, 2004), with lopinavir and nelfinavir also showing in vitro activity (Chen et al., 2004a; Chu et al., 2004a; Yamamoto et al., 2004).",

More recently, NIAID scientists revealed that a pseudovirus expressing a partially humanized strain S (GD03T13) (GZ-03-01, Fig. 1 of Ref. (Song et al., 2005b) is markedly resistant to neutralization by immune IgG purified from mice vaccinated against S from strains derived from human isolates (Urbani strain) (Yang et al., 2005c). Antibodies raised against the human strain mediated enhanced entry of a lentiviral vector expressing civet S, but resistance to IgG enhancement of civet S is not limited to vaccinated mice; human monoclonal antibodies (S3.1, S111, S117) created from the immune repertoire of a convalescent patient (Traggiai et al., 2004) also exhibited these phenomena. Thus, a vaccine against humanized SARS-CoV might enhance the pathogenicity of a normally low-pathogenic animal SARS-CoV-like virus.",

A gene-based vaccine has also been tested, boosted by inactivated virus to broaden the immune response (Kong et al., 2005; Talaat and Stemke-Hale, 2005). A combination of nucleocapsid DNA vaccine against SARS-CoV with N protein has been shown to be required to generate antibody and a CD8+ response, and the presence of adjuvant determined whether humoral or cellular immunity is elicited (Azizi et al., 2005). Immunization with plasmid DNA carrying various S fragments have been shown by scientists at Hong Kong University to elicit antibodies in some mice, with the S1 fragment promoting a Th1-mediated antibody isotype switching. Both anti-S1 and anti-S2 antibodies were required for virus neutralization (Zeng et al., 2004a). One study of an experimental DNA vaccine against SARS-CoV showed that N alone was sufficient to induce antibody and CTL responses in mice (Zhu et al., 2004). In another study, N sequences linked to those specifying calreticulin (enhances antigen presentation to CD8+ T-cells) was efficacious in inducing N-specific humoral and cellular immune responses and in reducing the viral titer in mice challenged with N-expressing vaccinia virus (Kim et al., 2004). In mice immunized with plasmids, S, N, and M DNA vaccines were all able to elicit immune responses, with S and M eliciting more potent humoral and cellular immune responses, respectively (Wang et al., 2005c).",

SARS-CoV made a fleeting reemergence in the winter of 2003\u20132004 (Liang et al., 2004; Normile, 2004; Song et al., 2005b). With the discovery that the bat is the natural reservoir, it appears likely that SARS-CoV will eventually reemerge. However, the prospect of another large outbreak is low because an animal strain would have to adapt to humans before becoming epidemic, although it is not impossible that human isolate of SARS-CoV could have escaped back to the wild. Human strains of SARS-CoV bind efficiently to civet ACE2 (Li et al., 2005e). It might also bind bat ACE2 with avidity. The ease of species jumping as humans move into areas with SARS-CoV is suggested by the finding of SARS-CoV in rats, and the identification of serologically positive civets raised for the pet market in a farm in Shanwei, Guangdong. In the latter case, seed animals for that farm were bought at various markets in the province (Tu et al., 2004). Bats, civets, rodents, and other small mammals will need to be included in the surveillance for the presence of SARS-CoV.",
