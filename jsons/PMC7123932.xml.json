There are accounts of epidemics dating back to the times of Hippocrates (459\u2013377 BC) and the ancient Greeks [1]. Fourteenth century Europe lost a quarter of its 100 million people to Black Death. The fall of the Aztec empire in 1521 was due to smallpox that eradicated half of its 3.5 million population. The pandemic influenza of 1918 caused over 20 million excess deaths in 12 months. More recently, the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak of 2003 highlighted the rapid spread of an epidemic at the global level. The outbreak, emanating from a small Guangzhou province in China, spread around the world requiring a concerted response from public health administrations around the world and the World Health Organization (WHO) to curtail the epidemic [5]. The WHO and CDC [2] actively engage in worldwide surveillance of infectious diseases, and prioritize prevention and control measures at the root cause of epidemics.",

The results of such search queries often lead to sites that may help diagnose the illness and offer medical advice. Recently, Google has addressed this issue by capturing the keywords of queries and identifying specific searches that involve search terms that indicate influenza-like-illness (ILI) [4]. Published research on influenza Internet surveillance also includes search \u201cadvertisement click-through\u201d [3] using a set of Yahoo search queries containing the words flu or influenza [9] and health website access logs [6, 7]. Other information sources, such as telephone triage services, can be useful to ILI detection. The findings in Yih et al. [11] show that telephone triage service is not a reliable measure for influenza surveillance due to service coverage; however, it may be beneficial in certain situations where other surveillance measures are inadequate.",

Each provider reports data to CDC on the total number of patients seen and the number of those patients with influenza-like-illness (ILI) by age group. For this system, ILI is defined as fever (temperature of 100\u00b0F [37.8\u00b0C] or greater) and a cough and/or a sore throat in the absence of a known cause other than influenza [2].",

Secondhand knowledge can be writing about a friend, schoolmate, family member or co-worker, but a blogger could also post details on a famous individual such as a sports player.
