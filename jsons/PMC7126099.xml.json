            "text": "Influenza is a highly contagious viral infection responsible for seasonal epidemics. The virological basis of the frequent epidemics is related to the fact that the influenza viruses can quickly mutate within their own antigenic structure. Changes can occur in haemagglutinin and/or neuraminidase, producing new virus strains against which the population has no immunity. Point mutations (antigenic drift) are responsible for annual epidemics and can occur in both influenza viruses A and B. Major changes and reassortment between human and animal influenza viruses, resulting a substitution of one or both the surface proteins (antigenic shift), only occur in influenza A viruses and can be responsible for pandemics [1].",

The circulation of new antigenic variants cause annual epidemics characterized by high morbidity, increased hospitalization and mortality [3]. The majority of influenza-related deaths occur in subjects over 65 years of age and are mainly registered during the circulation of A/H3N2 influenza viruses [4]; in children the incidence rate reaches 30% and causes mainly a significant increase in medical treatment and hospitalization [18]. Moreover, the high level of influenza virus diffusion and the short period of incubation make it difficult to develop timely strategies to control and limit the spread of the illness. Consequently, vaccination remains the best measure for the prevention and control of the illness. In order to limit the circulation of the influenza virus and protect the subjects at high risk, the objective established by the NHP for 1998\u20132000 in Italy was 75% of vaccination coverage in the population older than 65 years [12]. In Italy, vaccine immunoprophylaxis, conducted yearly through specific vaccination campaigns promoted by the Ministry of Health and ISS, is free administered to subjects over 65 years or at high risk of complications through the network of vaccination centers of the Departments of Prevention or through regional GPs.",
