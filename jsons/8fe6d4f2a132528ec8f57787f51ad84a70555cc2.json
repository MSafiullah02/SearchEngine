Herein we describe the pathologic findings of novel influenza A (H1N1) infection based on findings in 2 autopsy cases. The first patient, a 36-year-old man, had flu-like symptoms; oseltamivir (Tamiflu) therapy was started 8 days after onset of symptoms, and he died on day 15 of his illness. At autopsy, the main finding was diffuse alveolar damage with extensive fresh intra-alveolar hemorrhage. The second patient, a 46-year-old woman with alcoholism, was found unresponsive in a basement and brought to the hospital intoxicated and confused. Her condition deteriorated rapidly, and she died 4 days after admission. The main autopsy finding was acute bronchopneumonia with gram-positive cocci, intermixed with diffuse alveolar damage. The pathologic findings in these contrasting cases of novel influenza A (H1N1) infection are similar to those previously described for seasonal influenza. The main pathologic abnormality in fatal cases is diffuse alveolar damage, but it may be overshadowed by an acute bacterial bronchopneumonia.",

The infection was rapidly reported from several other countries worldwide and was deemed a pandemic on June 11, 2009 . Although a small number of deaths occurred (mostly in adults between 30 and 50 years old), the majority of reported cases were mild, occurring mainly in people younger than 25 years. At the time of this writing (July 1, 2009), 77,201 cases of novel influenza A (H1N1) virus infection and 332 deaths have been reported to the World Health Organization from multiple nations worldwide, including 27,717 cases and 127 deaths from the United States. 2 The number of cases and deaths in the United States now exceeds that reported from Mexico, although the latter was the first to report rapid spread of the infection. Within the United States, the state with the largest number of deaths so far is New York State (35 deaths), which is the state of residence of the patients in our report.",

            "text": "Influenza viruses are classified into 3 major genera (A, B, and C), 6 of which influenza A is of greatest clinical significance. Each genus is further classified into serotypes based on the viral proteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (N). Among the various possible subtypes (denoted by combinations of H and N) of seasonal influenza A virus, only 3 (H1N1, H1N2, and H3N2) are currently circulating among humans. 7 Novel influenza A (H1N1) virus (also known as new influenza virus, swine-like influenza virus, swine-origin influenza virus, and colloquially as \"swine flu\") is a novel form of influenza A virus resulting from a combination of genes derived from 2 types of swine influenza, one of which is, in turn, a \"triple reassortant\" of human, avian, and swine influenza A strains. 6 This new virus is not only antigenically and genetically distinct from seasonal influenza A (H1N1) virus, but is also usually sensitive to oseltamivir, a neuraminidase inhibitor to which 10.9% of recent seasonal influenza A viruses were resistant. 8 The pathologic features of (seasonal) influenza pneumonia are well documented. [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] Most existing pathologic data on influenza pneumonia are derived from autopsy series, with only a few reports of biopsy findings. 17, 18 The histologic findings of influenza pneumonia can be divided into those caused by the virus and those attributable to superimposed bacterial infection. The two often coexist in the same case. Findings attributed to viral infection include parenchymal and airway abnormalities. The major parenchymal abnormalities are DAD and intra-alveolar hemorrhage. DAD may be seen as early as the second day of illness and as late as day 21. 9,11 It is more prominent in patients requiring mechanical ventilation and supplemental oxygen. Abnormalities in the trachea, bronchi, and bronchioles occur in most cases, the most important being acute necrotizing tracheobronchitis, bronchitis, or bronchiolitis. These changes appear between days 3 and 13 of the illness. Mild chronic inflammation of the airways and degenerative changes of the lining epithelium are also common. Immunohistochemical techniques have demonstrated viral antigens within airway epithelium. 19, 20 Another major finding in the airway mucosa in influenza is squamous metaplasia, 21 which sometimes is so striking as to suggest a neoplastic squamous proliferation. 11, 16 Unlike many other viral infections, viral inclusions and viral cytopathic effects are not seen in influenza infection. The major finding attributable to superimposed bacterial infection is acute bronchopneumonia, characterized by a neutrophilic infiltrate within alveolar spaces, accompanied by varying amounts of fibrin and edema. The superimposed bacterium is mostly Staphylococcus aureus, S pneumoniae, or Haemophilus influenzae.",

Other viral infections associated with DAD include avian influenza (H5N1), 23 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, 24 adenovirus, hantavirus, herpesvirus, cytomegalovirus, parainfluenza virus, and measles virus. Noninfectious causes of DAD also need to be considered, including drug reactions, toxic inhalants, gastric acid aspiration, and connective tissue disease. 25 In the vast majority of cases, the histologic features of DAD are nonspecific and do not allow determination of a precise cause.

However, some studies of oseltamivir treatment of hospitalized patients with seasonal influenza have indicated benefit, including reductions in mortality or duration of hospitalization even for patients whose treatment was started more than 48 hours after illness onset.\" 22 With regard to pathology, the autopsy findings in case 1 were consistent with a viral pneumonia and fit well with descriptions of \"uncomplicated influenza pneumonia\" in the literature. The major histologic findings were DAD and intraalveolar hemorrhage, and there was no evidence of superimposed bacterial bronchopneumonia. Necrotizing bronchitis/ bronchiolitis and squamous metaplasia, findings frequently seen in seasonal influenza A, were absent or inconspicuous. A specific diagnosis of influenza A (H1N1) viral pneumonia was made only retrospectively, after results of postmortem studies were available.In contrast, our second case had a distinctly nonrespiratory presentation. Even after radiographic abnormalities were found, they were understandably attributed to aspiration pneumonia rather than a viral process. A similar atypical presentation was described by Oseasohn et al 15 in their series of 33 fatal cases of Asian influenza. One of their patients (case 20) was a 52-year-old woman hospitalized for a head injury sustained when she was intoxicated. The authors made the point that in rare cases, influenza virus is recovered from the lungs of patients lacking premonitory symptoms of a flu-like illness. Pathologically, our second case had typical features of a superimposed bacterial pneumonia. The associated/underlying virus-associated DAD was overshadowed by the bacterial process to such an extent that the DAD was initially thought to be a result of the bacterial pneumonia. If influenza A (H1N1) virus had not been detected by rRT-PCR from the patient's lungs, the presence of the virus-related DAD could have been easily overlooked and attributed to bacterial infection.Problems in making a rapid clinical diagnosis of novel influenza A (H1N1) infection are readily apparent from these 2 cases. As case 1 illustrates, the diagnosis may not be suspected unless a specific aspect of the history raises this possibility. The resultant delay in diagnosis and therapy may result in an unfavorable outcome. Even with a high index of suspicion, clinical diagnosis is difficult because confirmatory testing takes at least a few days and up to a week. Our second case highlights the difficulty in suspecting novel influenza A (H1N1) infection in patients with atypical clinical manifestations. In such cases, in which there are virtually no clinical clues to suggest a viral process, it may impossible to make a correct diagnosis antemortem. It is safe to state, however, that in the throes of a pandemic, any patient with an unexplained flu-like illness or",
