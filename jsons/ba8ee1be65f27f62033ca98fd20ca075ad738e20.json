Recent studies have profoundly altered this simplistic view of eosinophils and their function. New insights into the molecular pathways that control the development, trafficking and degranulation of eosinophils have improved our understanding of the immunomodulatory functions of these cells and their roles in promoting homeostasis. Likewise, recent developments have generated a more sophisticated view of how eosinophils contribute to the pathogenesis of different diseases, including asthma and primary hypereosinophilic syndromes, and have also provided us with a more complete appreciation of the activities of these cells during parasitic infection.",

Interestingly, our appreciation of this unique property of eosinophils is clear and steadfast, but a com prehensive understanding of the function of these cells in health and disease remains elusive. Some basic char acteristics of eosinophils are established and accepted. It is clear that eosinophils are granulocytes that develop in the bone marrow from pluripotent progenitors. They are released into the peripheral blood in a phenotypi cally mature state, and they are capable of being activated and recruited into tissues in response to appropriate stimuli, most notably the cytokine interleukin5 (IL5) and the eotaxin chemokines. Eosinophils spend only a brief time in the peripheral blood (they have a half life of ~18 hrs) 1 before they migrate to the thymus or gastrointestinal tract, where they reside under homeo static conditions 2 . In response to inflammatory stimuli, eosinophils develop from committed bone marrow progenitors, after which they exit the bone marrow, migrate into the blood and subsequently accumulate in peripheral tissues, where their survival is prolonged (reviewed in REFS 3-5).",

For example, the longheld belief that eosinophils promote immunity to helminths has been called into question by results from animal studies, some of which suggest that eosinophils may be serving to promote the needs and longevity of specific parasites 6,7 . Likewise, eosinophils are clearly recruited to and activated in lung tissue as part of the pathophysiology of asthma, and most current evidence suggests that eosinophils contribute to airway dysfunction and tissue remodelling in this disorder 8, 9 . Evolution tells us that the ability to induce pathology cannot be a 'raison d'\u00eatre' for any existing cell lineage, and recent findings on the antimicrobial and antiviral activities of eosinophils suggest that the pathology that arises from dysregulated eosinophilia in the airways may be collateral damage related to host defence. Similarly, although there are now two unique eosinophildeficient mouse strains 10,11 , there are no known unique eosinophildeficiency states in humans to help us to decipher the importance of these cells in vivo.",

However, in contrast to IL33, there is no evidence that eosinophil activation in response to HMGB1 involves IL5. First identified as a nuclear protein and transcrip tion factor, HMGB1 is expressed ubiquitously and mediates inflammatory responses via its receptors. The HMGB1 receptors that have been identified so far are receptor for advanced glycation endproducts (RAGE), Tolllike receptor 2 (TLR2) and TLR4. Importantly, eosinophil mobilization and activation were observed in response to HMGB1 in tumour cell lysates 29 . Further work is needed in this area, as a better appreciation of the way in which eosinophils are activated in response to HMGB1 and other, related damageassociated molecular patterns (DAMPs) may explain the eosinophil recruit ment that is observed in the setting of tissue destruction associated with myalgias and myopathies. In one such interaction, eosinophils release the contents of their specific granules in response to external stimuli. Some of these granule contents are released via membrane-bound vesicles known as eosinophil sombrero vesicles. Eosinophils also synthesize lipid mediators for release in cytoplasmic lipid bodies and store Charcot-Leyden crystal protein (CLC) in primary granules. Although not highly biosynthetic, mature eosinophils have minimal numbers of mitochondria and a limited endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and Golgi, as well as a nucleus. Eosinophils express a wide variety of receptors that modulate adhesion, growth, survival, activation, migration and pattern recognition. Mouse eosinophils do not express CLC or Fc\u03b5 receptor 1 (Fc\u03b5R1) and have divergent homologues of sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectin 8 (SIGLEC-8) and the granule ribonucleases eosinophil-derived neurotoxin (EDN) and eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) 12 .

Previously, the release of secre tory mediators was assumed to take place primar ily through cytolytic degranulation, a mechanism through which a pathogenic assault (real or perceived) results in the complete emptying of the eosinophil's arsenal of preformed cationic proteins. Interestingly, a careful analysis of electron micrographs of eosino phils degranulating in tissues suggested a more con trolled process, which was given the name 'piecemeal degranulation' 30 to reflect the fact that the eosinophil was able to release bits or pieces of its granule con tents in response to a given stimulus, while remain ing otherwise intact and apparently viable. Piecemeal degranulation is now accepted as the most commonly observed physiological form of eosinophil degranula tion. Eosinophils undergoing piecemeal degranulation in response to cytokines, such as interferon\u03b3 (IFN\u03b3) and CCL11, develop cytoplasmic secretory vesicles, known as eosinophil sombrero vesicles 31 (FIG. 2) , and remain viable and fully responsive to subsequent stimuli.",

Eosinophil responses to pathogens and parasites Eosinophils and helminths: who wins? The historic view that eosinophils promote host defence against hel minths arose largely from histological images of eosino phils and parasites in tissue specimens and from in vitro studies that documented the antiparasitic activities of the eosinophil granule proteins MBP and ECP. With the development of reagents that block eosinophilia in mice (such as IL5specific antibodies) and of IL5 or eosinophildeficient mice, the picture has become more complex. For instance, the helminth Schistosoma mansoni, although not a natural mouse pathogen, can infect wildtype mice and can elicit a profound T H 2type cytokinemediated pathology and cause the accumula tion of eosinophils in tissues 55 . Although the eosino phil granule proteins ECP and MBP are toxic to both schisto somules and the larvae of S. mansoni, the manip ulation of eosinophils in mouse models had no signifi cant impact on disease development during S. mansoni infection 56, 57 . However, in Strongyloides stercoralis and Angiostrongylus cantonensis infection models, eosino phil depletion resulted in prolonged survival of tissue based larval forms of the parasites 58, 59 .

The genotype 434CC -which encodes the more neutral and somewhat less cytotoxic form of ECP -is found commonly among Ugandans, who live in a region endemic for S. mansoni infection. By contrast, the 434CC genotype is quite rare in Sudan, where S. mansoni is not endemic. Although this result suggests that there is no selective advantage for those individuals whose eosinophils might provide stronger antischistosomal host defence, the authors of this study determined that individuals with the 434CC genotype Eosinophils not only respond to signals, but also have a definitive impact on the actions of other leukocytes. Eosinophils can express MHC class II and co-stimulatory molecules, process antigens and stimulate T cells to proliferate and produce cytokines in an antigen-specific manner 39 . Furthermore, acting together with dendritic cells (DCs), eosinophils regulate the recruitment of T helper 2 (T H 2) cells in response to allergen sensitization and challenge by producing CC-chemokine ligand 17 (CCL17) and CCL22 (REFS 40, 41) .

As such, the selective advantage may be for those individuals whose eosinophils promote less collateral tissue damage when faced with a similar pathogen burden. Similarly, cerebral malaria, a severe outcome of infection with Plasmodium falciparum, is also associated with eosinophilia and elevated serum levels of ECP.

In wildtype mice, infection with Trichinella spiralis induces eosinophil recruitment to the infected tissues and the formation of nurse cells in skeletal muscle. In eosinophildeficient \u0394dblGATA and TgPHIL mice, T. spiralis larvae do not survive, largely owing to the diminished recruitment of T H 2 cells and a concomitant increase in the activity of induc ible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) and the synthesis of nitric oxide in local macrophages 6,7 . One interpretation of these results is that the parasites recruit eosinophils to support their own persistence and survival; another possibility is that eosinophils are recruited to main tain homeostatic balance by limiting the development of T H 1type immune responses that lead to oxidative damage and tissue destruction. How the parasite elic its this response and whether this finding is unique to Trichinella species are important subjects for future consideration. In addition, it will be interesting to address whether the mechanisms by which T. spiralis recruits eosinophils to muscle tissue, the activation state of the eosinophils at this site and the mediators released in situ are similar to those involved in eosinophilic inflammatory myopathies.",

Whether eosino phils and their secretory mediators have physiological bactericidal functions in vivo requires further study.

A recent concept to emerge is that eosinophils and their secretory mediators may have a role in pro moting antiviral host defence. An initial study showed that eosinophil secretory mediators decrease the ability of RSV to infect target host epithelial cells 74 . This was followed by a later report 75 that found that eosinophils that were induced by allergen sensitization decreased viral loads during parainfluenza virus infection in a guinea pig asthma model. Accelerated clearance of RSV has been demonstrated in the lungs of eosinophil enriched Cd2IL5transgenic mice (which over express IL5 under the control of the Cd2 promoter) 76 , and activated eosinophils protect mice from the lethal sequelae of acute pneumovirus infection (C. Percopo, K.D.D., S. Ochkur, J. Lee, J. Domachowske and H.F.R., unpublished observations). Moreover, both human and mouse eosinophils release immunomodulatory mediators, notably IL6, in response to infection with respiratory virus pathogens 77, 78 .",

However, there is no direct or obvious relationship between the actions of this enzyme and eosinophils or eosinophilia. It is not clear why mutations in calpain 3 result in signals that elicit eosinophil accumulation, what these signals might be, whether eosinophils are a primary or indirect target, and whether eosinophils are promoting tissue damage or altering the local immune status. One possibility is that inflamed, damaged mus cle tissue releases endogenous alarmins (such as IL33 and/or HMGB1) that activate innate immune signal ling pathways that lead to peripheral blood and tissue eosinophilia. Of note, limbgirdle muscular dystrophy type 2A, which is a common autosomal recessive form of muscular dystrophy, has also been directly linked to mutations in the gene encoding calpain 3. Although eosinophils do not have a prominent role in this dis order, transient eosinophilia has been reported in the early stages of the disease. Similarly, no infiltra tion of eosinophils into muscle tissue was reported in calpain 3deficient mice 112 , although this observation should be reassessed in other mouse strains.",

            "text": "Hypereosinophilic syndromes. Hypereosinophilic syn dromes are disorders of eosinophil haematopoiesis that result in hypereosinophilia (defined as >1,500 eosino phils per mm 3 ) in peripheral blood in the absence of any known aetiology. Although these disorders were recognized early on as clinically heterogeneous, recent studies have revealed the molecular basis for a few of the distinct phenotypes. The identification of myeloprolifera tive hypereosinophilic syndrome (MHES) emerged from the dramatic therapeutic responses observed in a subset of patients with hypereosinophilic syndrome following empirical treatment with imatinib, a tyrosine kinase inhibitor first developed for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukaemia 113 . This clinical observation led to the detection of a deletion in chromosome 4 that results in the fusion of the genes encoding premRNA 3\u0374end processing factor FIP1 (FIP1L1) and plateletderived growth factor receptor\u03b1 (PDGFRA) 114 . This leads to the production of a FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion protein that constitutively activates proliferation and survival path ways, resulting in the clonal proliferation of eosinophils, elevated serum levels of tryptase and vitamin B12 (also known as cobalamin), severe peripheral eosinophilia and endorgan damage, the most severe form of which is endomyocardial fibrosis. Other fusion kinases have also been identified in individuals with MHES; other individ uals display clinical symptoms consistent with MHES but without a clear molecular diagnosis. Thus far, all of the PDGFRA or PDGFRBderived mutant fusion proteins that have been identified in humans have been associated with eosinophilia, for reasons that remain obscure.",

Likewise, imatinib inhibits the growth of the human eosinophil leukaemia EoL1 cell line, which expresses the FIP1L1-PDGFRA fusion protein 115 . Most intriguingly, the uncontrolled activity of the fusion protein lies within the PDGFRA component, as the fusion eliminates an inhibitory juxtamembrane region encoded by exon 12 of the PDGFRA gene, resulting in constitutive signalling by PDGFRA in the absence of its ligand 116 .",

Symptoms included severe muscle pain accompanied by profound peripheral eosinophilia. By 1990, more than 1,000 cases had been identified. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention defined EMS by three criteria: peripheral eosinophilia of \u226510 9 eosinophils per litre of blood; generalized myalgias of sufficient severity to interfere with daily activities; and the absence of an infectious or neoplastic aetiology. Although a specific impurity (1,1\u0374-ethylidenebis[tryptophan]; also known as peak E) in l-tryptophan from one dietary supplement supplier was identified 142 , there has never been closure on a number of issues, including the disease-eliciting potential of this impurity (or of l-tryptophan itself) in a robust animal model of disease. Similarly, there is no definitive information on the molecular signals that promote eosinophilia and eosinophil tissue infiltration in EMS, nor is it clear whether the eosinophils were in fact causing the acute and/or chronic symptoms. Other theories have emerged, including those featuring tryptophan metabolites such as indoleamine as inhibitors of histamine degradation, leading to eosinophilia and myalgias 143 . Likewise, age (>45 years) and the HLA alleles DRB1*03, DRB1*04 and DQA1*0601 have been identified as risk factors for the development of EMS 144 .",
