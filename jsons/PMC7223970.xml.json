They performed a survey of chief residents in otolaryngology\u2013head and neck surgery programs in the United States. First tube change was performed after a mean of 5.3 days (range 3\u20137) after the initial procedure. In all, 42% of responders reported awareness of a loss of airway and 15% awareness of a death as a result of a first cannula change at their institution during their residency. The authors discuss their results as surprisingly high and as an unacceptable rate of major complications. No information was provided about complication rates of consecutive tube changes. Another study reported on first cannula change in a retrospective analysis of 151 pediatric patients [14]. The majority of first cannula changes were performed within 3 days after surgery, and loss of airway was recorded in one case. Goldenberg et al. [15] reported on complications related to tracheostomy between 1987 and 1996 in a single center and found eight deaths (0.7% of all tracheostomies) directly related to tracheostomy of which four were due to loss of airway. Our study cannot add data on the specific issue of first cannula changes after tracheostomy, as we focused on long-term tracheotomized patients, and therefore included many patients weeks after tracheostomy has been established in another hospital and a detailed information about the first cannula changes was not available.",

We overall observed more cannula changes, more urgencies and more complications in the PDT group compared with patients who had received an OST.

As we did not expect these findings in this prospective study, no data were assessed regarding the indication of elective changes. However, we conclude that elective changes even in a long-term setting have to be well indicated as they are not without risks. Typical reasons for elective cannula changes were described by White et al. [10], except for certain reasons which can usually not be influenced by the therapeutic team, for example a cuff leak. An experienced team, however, with optimized standards and flow charts may result in less frequent rates of cannula changes in order to change size or length, optimize fitting, or enable speaking.",

However, a systematic review and a meta-analysis reported that there is only weak evidence supporting the statement that tracheostomy teams reduce total tracheostomy time and increase the use of speaking valves [7]. Adding our study to these results, we think that an interprofessional tracheostomy team might be one option to reduce elective and urgent cannula changes, and therefore may lead to fewer patient-associated complications.",
