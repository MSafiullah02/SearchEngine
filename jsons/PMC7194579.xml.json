            "text": "Coronaviruses are enveloped non-segmented positive-sense RNA viruses belonging to the family Coronaviridae, with a genome ranging from 26 to 32 kilobases in length [1]. Among the several coronaviruses that are pathogenic to humans, most are associated with mild clinical symptoms, with two notable exceptions: severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [2,3], which have caused more than 10000 cumulative cases in the past two decades with mortality rates of 9.5% and 34.4% respectively [[4], [5], [6]]. In December 2019, a novel pneumonia, termed coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), emerged in Wuhan, China and has been proven to be caused by a severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) [7]. All the twenty-seven first cases reported by December 31, 2019 were closely related to exposure with the Huanan Seafood Market in Wuhan [8]. By analyzing the genome sequence of SARS-CoV-2, it was speculated that the pathogen originated in bat, the natural reservoir host, and then transmitted to humans via an uncertain wild animal intermediate host [9]. There is convincing evidence that the human-to-human transmission has occurred since the end of December 2019 or the early January 2020 [10]. To control the spread of COVID-19, the Wuhan authority has sealed off the entire city from outside contact since Jan 23, 2020. However, it's estimated that five million people have left Wuhan before the \u201clockdown\u201d and travelled throughout China [11]. By April 1, 2020, the disease has affected over 200 countries, with over 880,000 confirmed cases and 44220 deaths [[12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18]]. In China, substantial attention has focused mainly on Wuhan, whereas the detailed information regarding the disease outside Wuhan is rarely reported [19,20]. Furthermore, little is known about the changes in pathogenicity, clinical manifestations and mode of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 when the epidemic expanded beyond Wuhan.",

Then the RNA samples from the nasal swab specimens were extracted and subjected to the real-time RT-PCR test using SARS-Cov-2 specific primers and probes.

Compared with patients in Guangzhou, patients in Wuhan were more severe, reflected by that Wuhan patients had a higher incidence of dyspnea and ARDS, higher levels of inflammatory biomarkers and worse prognosis. These differences could be due to age and pre-existing conditions [8,25,26]. However, in the present study, we did not observe an evident difference in underlying disease between Guangzhou patients and Wuhan patients. We speculate that the differences may be related to that the diminishing pathogenicity of the virus after transmission of multiple generations [5,27], however, further studies are required to confirm this hypothesis. Besides, patients in Guangzhou were more aware of the disease; thus, they visited the hospital at the earlier stage with less severe symptoms. Furthermore, given the experience in Wuhan, the health authorities in Guangzhou were well-prepared for the epidemic and were able to carry out comprehensive screening, early case identification and contact tracing and timely treatment.",

Meanwhile, fecal RNA was positive in 4 out of 7 patients, indicating the possibility of gastrointestinal transmission. Xiao Fei also confirmed gastrointestinal infection by detecting SARS-CoV-2 in feces and gastrointestinal tissues [28]. These findings have important implications for patient triage and hospital risk zoning. Gastroenterology outpatient medical staff could be at higher risk when encountering COVID patients, thus more aggressive PPE protection and proactive patient screening are necessary. In addition, sufficient education and protocols should be given to caregivers who could be exposed to the patients' vomits and feces directly, and feces disposal should be managed properly to reduce environmental harzards. More importantly, we found that two patients\u2019 fecal virus RNA turned negative 5 and 6 days later than the nasopharyngeal swab respectively, suggesting that transimission of virus is possibly prolonged, and fecal virus RNA may be an indispensable indicator for lifting quarantines. Given that some \u201crecovered\u201d cases being tested positive again a few days after discharged have been reported recently [29], our findings highlight the importance of fecal virus test for patient management and quarantines. The health authority may also have to re-consider quarantine strategy for possible extended case management time and burden when distributing health resources.",

A large fraction of early reported cases in Wuhan were linked to Huanan seafood markets, whereas none of cases in Guangzhou had a history of exposure to wildlife markets. Furthermore, 10 patients from Guangzhou were involved in seven cases of clustering. This finding suggests strong community transmission poses a great challenge to the entire prevention and control. It resonates with the concept that the transmissibility increases while virulence decreases as virus spread [30]. As indicated by Tang's research, the L type of SARS-CoV-2 prevalent in the early stages of the outbreak in Wuhan, decreased after early January 2020, while the S type, which is less aggressive, have increased in relative frequency due to relatively weaker selective pressure [31]. Thus early detection and timely isolation is vital before a case becomes a cluster. It also raises the concern that the risk and benefit should be balanced in home quarantine for confirmed cases which could result in family case clusters.",
