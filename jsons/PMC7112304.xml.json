Although there are efficient vaccines against some of these viruses, for the majority there is no prophylactic or therapeutic treatment. The known vaccines typically work by eliciting antibodies that block entry of the pathogen into cells, which in the case of enveloped viruses involves antibody binding to the viral envelope proteins. The viral fusion protein is the key factor that induces the membrane fusion reaction that allows viral entry. A number of enveloped viruses display only a single protein on the particle surface, which necessarily mediates attachment to the cell surface as well as inducing the subsequent membrane fusion reaction. Understanding the interactions of antibodies with the viral envelope proteins\u2014in particular with the fusion protein\u2014and the antibody neutralization mechanism is paramount to develop potentially protective vaccines for HIV and many other human pathogenic enveloped viruses for which there are no vaccines available.",

This extended form then collapses into a \u201chairpin,\u201d as illustrated in Figure 1\n, in which the target membrane-inserted non-polar segment is relocated to the proximity of the viral trans-membrane anchor of the fusion protein, effectively bringing the two membranes to a distance within 1 nm (Harrison, 2015), overcoming the dehydration force and allowing direct membrane apposition. The two membranes then fuse via an initial hemifusion step in which the lipids of the outer leaflets of the membranes merge, followed by formation of an initial fusion pore (or multiple small pores) by merging of the inner leaflets, and then expansion of the fusion pore(s) to full fusion. The mechanistic details of the latter steps are, however, not completely understood (Nikolaus et al., 2011).",

            "text": "The interactions with the target cell that trigger the fusogenic conformational change vary for different viruses, and can be divided into several broad categories (Yamauchi and Helenius, 2013). In the first one, fusion is triggered directly by interactions of the fusion protein (as in the case of HIV)\u2014or by a companion viral glycoprotein at the particle surface (seen for paramyxoviruses and herpes viruses)\u2014with a cellular receptor. In some cases, a sequential interaction with a primary receptor and then a co-receptor is required, as in HIV interacting with CD4, which triggers a first conformational change (Ozorowski et al., 2017) that then allows interaction with the chemokine receptors CCR5 or CXCR4 (Feng et al., 1996). In this case, the virus can fuse directly with the plasma membrane or can be incorporated into internal vesicles before fusion. In the second broad category, the interactions with receptor(s) at the cell surface lead to particle endocytosis, and binding of protons in the low pH endosomal environment triggers the fusogenic conformational change (seen for influenza viruses, alphaviruses, rhabdoviruses, flaviviruses, and bunyaviruses) (White and Whittaker, 2016). In the third category, the initial interactions of the virion at the cell surface trigger endocytosis, and then a second internal receptor, often found in late endosomes\u2014and binding of which requires further proteolysis of the fusion protein by an endosomal protease in the case of some viruses (cf. Ebola virus)\u2014triggers the final fusogenic conformational change (e.g, filoviruses and arenaviruses) (Jae and Brummelkamp, 2015). Finally, for certain viruses the fusion protein may require an activating redox reaction involving disulfide bonds to induce membrane fusion (Key et al., 2015).",

We discuss the strategies that have been developed to stabilize them in their prefusion form enabling structural studies, and the role of antibodies in targeting and stabilizing relevant conformational epitopes. These studies also highlight the importance of engineering stabilized forms that preserve the antigencity of the metastable prefusion form on virions to use as immunogens for subunit vaccine design. In this regard, we discuss more extensively the class I and II fusion proteins. We mention at the end the members of class III, as well as the enveloped viruses that appear to fall outside these three classes and for which a full characterization of the membrane fusion machinery still awaits high resolution structural studies.",

Although the very first X-ray structures of viral fusion proteins were obtained using crystals of the ectodomain directly cleaved off the membrane surface (or cleaved after detergent solubilisation) by controlled proteolysis (Rey et al., 1995, Wilson et al., 1981), the structures that followed were determined by crystallizing the recombinant ectodomain, which in most cases required additional stabilization to maintain its trimeric prefusion form upon folding in the absence of the transmembrane segments. An early example is the structure of the HA ectodomain from the reconstituted influenza A virus (H1 serotype) that caused the 1918 pandemic (Stevens et al., 2004). The recombinant HA0 ectodomain (i.e., the uncleaved form obtained by mutating the cleavage site between NSU and CSU, termed HA1 and HA2, respectively) was monomeric unless engineered with a trimerization motif fused at its C terminus, replacing the trans-membrane segment and cytosolic tail. The motif used was derived from a bacteriophage trimeric fiber, termed \u201cfibritin foldon.\u201d",

            "text": "In parallel, work on the paramyxovirus fusion protein F showed that\u2014unexpectedly at the time\u2014knocking out the cleavage site between NSU and CSU led to a trimeric recombinant ectodomain that had spontaneously adopted the postfusion form (Chen et al., 2001, Yin et al., 2005), indicating that in this case, it was not the maturation cleavage (NSU and CSU are called F2 and F1, respectively, and the precursor F0) that primed the protein to undergo the fusogenic conformational change, as in other class I proteins. On paramyxovirus particles, the fusogenic conformational change of F is triggered by a companion protein that binds a receptor present at the surface of target cells. Receptor binding alters the conformation of the companion protein, affecting its interactions with F at the virion surface, such that F is triggered to induce fusion (Bose et al., 2015). In the context of the isolated recombinant F ectodomain, this change occurs spontaneously, but engineering a trimer stabilizing motif at its C-terminal end\u2014in this case a trimeric GCN4 element\u2014resulted in stabilization of the prefusion F trimer. This approach allowed the determination of the X-ray structure of prefusion F of the parainfluenza 5 virus (Yin et al., 2006), followed by those of several other paramyxoviruses. Similarly, the structure of the F protein from the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), which is closely related to the F protein of the paramyxoviruses but has two cleavage sites separating F2 from F1, was determined in its postfusion form, albeit cleaved and lacking the hydrophobic fusion peptide (McLellan et al., 2011, Swanson et al., 2011). In this case, addition of a trimerization foldon did not impede the conformational change, and only co-expression in the same cells with the antigen binding fragment (Fab) of a prefusion F specific, potently neutralizing antibody isolated from a patient (Figure 2), made it possible to maintain the trimeric prefusion form for structural studies (McLellan et al., 2013b).",

Even after these manipulations, diffraction quality crystals were only obtained with the protein in complex with the Fab of a neutralizing antibody isolated from a patient who survived the disease (Figure 2) (Lee et al., 2008). This pioneering result was followed by several structures of the GP from several filoviruses in complex with various other neutralizing antibodies, obtained by X-ray crystallography to around 3.5\u00c5 resolution and by cryo-EM at lower resolutions, reviewed recently by (Kirchdoerfer et al., 2017). Subsequent protein engineering by fusion of the fibritin foldon sequence at the C-terminal end resulted in stabilization of the structure such that crystals of the unliganded GP ectodomain were obtained that diffracted to much higher resolution (2.2 \u00c5 resolution) with clear electron density for the HR2 region (not resolved in previous structures) forming additional trimer contacts in the membrane proximal region of the molecule (Zhao et al., 2016).",

            "text": "The case of the retrovirus envelope (Env) protein trimer has been by far the most complex for structural studies due to its extensive glycosylation, conformational flexibility, and the tendency of the NSU and CSU to spontaneously dissociate. Initial attempts to generate stable, soluble trimers entailed knocking out the cleavage site between NSU and CSU, which are termed SU and TM for retroviruses in general, and gp120/gp41 for HIV, respectively. The resulting constructs were made trimeric by addition of a C-terminal foldon sequence, but it later became apparent that the resulting uncleaved Env trimer ectodomains did not display the same antigenicity pattern as native trimers on virions (Ringe et al., 2013). Other strategies to stabilize the trimer were therefore sought in order to preserve the native conformation as presented on infectious virions, which is the conformation recognized by neutralizing antibodies. Point mutations were designed to introduce cysteine residues strategically located for formation of inter-subunit disulfide bonds. This approach, inspired by the observation that some retroviruses have cysteines that cross-link NSU and CSU (Li et al., 2008a), involved a great deal of trial and error as the structure was not known at the time. It eventually led to an ectodomain variant termed \u201cSOS\u201d that was correctly processed into NSU and CSU, which remained covalently linked by the engineered disulfide bond (thereby avoiding NSU shedding), although this construct still did not form trimers (Binley et al., 2000). Further work was in part inspired by results on influenza virus HA introducing helix breaker residues (proline, but also glycine) in a region with strong \u03b1-helical propensity and displaying a heptad repeat pattern, but which forms a loop in between two consecutive helices in the structure of the prefusion form. This same segment is found as part of the long HR1 \u03b1-helical coiled-coil in the postfusion CSU. The proline mutants led to an HA molecule with identical antigenicity as wild-type, but which could not induce membrane fusion (Qiao et al., 1998). A similar strategy resulted in the HIV Env variant called \u201cSOSIP,\u201d which in addition to the SOS mutation has an I559P mutation in HR1 (Sanders et al., 2002). The SOSIP variant was trimeric and displayed an antigenic profile very similar to that of Env trimers exposed at the surface of virions. Additional modifications, such as removal of the amphipathic external membrane proximal region (MPR, Figure 1) by using a construct ending at position 664 (called SOSIP-664) avoided solubility issues of the initial constructs. Screening for orthologs from many strains\u2014HIV-1 Env is highly variable in amino acid sequence and is phylogenetically divided into 9 clades (A, B, C, D, E, F, G, K and O)\u2014with enhanced stability as examined in the electron microscope, further led to identifying HIV-1 clade A strain BG505 as a particularly stable trimer (Julien et al., 2013). The use of the BG505-SOSIP-664 trimer, together with key broadly neutralizing antibodies isolated from patients culminated in a number of structures (one of them illustrated in Figure 2). Readers are referred to recent reviews (Pancera et al., 2017, Ward and Wilson, 2017) that analyze the implications of the structures for understanding the fusogenic conformational change and for the design of better immunogens to use in developing HIV vaccines.",

The bNAb fragments also helped with structure determination by cryo-EM by providing a larger size complex to facilitate image analysis. The concomitant advent of direct electron counting detectors allowed the application of single particle cryo-EM to reach resolutions approaching 3\u00c5, which in turn made possible the visualization of natively glycosylated trimers. A fully glycosylated trans-membrane clade B native Env trimer (lacking the cytosolic tail but containing the MPR and the TM segments) was recently visualized to 4.2\u00c5 resolution by cryo-EM (Figure 1B, left) (Lee et al., 2016). This detergent-solubilized Env trimer lacks the cytosolic tail, but contains the external MPR and TM segment, and has an ectodomain conformation highly similar to that of the soluble SOSIP trimer (Figure 2), confirming the native conformation of the latter. The cryo-EM reconstruction also showed that the external MPR and TM segments do not form a rigid structure relative to the ectodomain, as they appear ill-defined and mobile within a detergent micelle in the structure.",

            "text": "In addition to the retrovirus Env trimer, the coronavirus spike (S) protein is another class I fusion protein that proved difficult to crystallize due to its extensive glycosylation (around 40 N-linked glycans attached per protomer, depending on the CoV) and very large size, as each protomer in the trimer is 1,300 amino acids long. The recent advances in cryo-EM enabled the determination of the structures of the prefusion S ectodomain from several CoVs, beginning with the \u03b2-coronaviruses mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) (Walls et al., 2016a) and the HKU1 human coronavirus (Kirchdoerfer et al., 2016) to around 4\u00c5 resolution, where the polypeptide chains could be traced. These structures used the S0 precursor ectodomain (i.e, with ablation of cleavage site between NSU and CSU) fused at the C-terminal end to a trimer-stabilizing element in order to maintain its trimeric conformation. In spite of the presence of the added trimerization motif, the HR2 region is disordered in all the structures, suggesting that it may not contribute to interactions stabilizing the trimer as seen for other class I proteins. In several coronaviruses S0 undergoes more than one proteolytic maturation step: an initial cleavage generating the S1 and S2 subunits in the producer cell (a cleavage event that is not conserved across coronaviruses) is followed by further cleavage of S2 to generate an S2\u2032 subunit within an endosomal compartment of the target cell (Burkard et al., 2014). As S2\u2032 has the fusion peptide at its N-terminal end, it corresponds better to the CSU indicated in Figure 1, and it is rather this proteolytic event that would be expected to be universal across coronaviruses. Cryo-EM studies also showed that the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the SARS CoV and the MERS CoV adopts different conformations on the spike, with a closed and an open conformation in which the surface that binds receptor is occluded and exposed, respectively, thereby regulating attachment to host cells (Pallesen et al., 2017, Yuan et al., 2017).",

This modification allowed a 50-fold increase in immunogen production yields, and the resulting molecule elicited strongly neutralizing antibodies in immunized animals.

The first stabilized constructs contained an engineered intra-CSU (F1 in RSV) disulfide bond and two cavity-filling mutations in addition to the fibritin foldon fused at the C-terminal end (McLellan et al., 2013a). Further work identified proline mutations again in the HR1 region of F1, which allowed much higher yields of recombinant prefusion trimer (Krarup et al., 2015). This work also identified the role of p27 (the segment between the two maturation cleavage sites in F), the presence of which blocks F trimerization. Eliminating the p27 segment altogether was found to facilitate trimerization with the resulting trimers retaining the wild-type antigenicity (Krarup et al., 2015). In parallel, additional studies have introduced a \u201ccysteine zipper\u201d in the HR2 region in prefusion F0, which preserves the native conformation of the protein (Stewart-Jones et al., 2015). The enhanced trimer stabilization provided by the cysteine zipper in HR2 renders the foldon unnecessary, which is useful as its presence is undesirable when using the recombinant molecule for vaccine development.",

The arenavirus envelope glycoprotein complex (GPC) differs from other class I fusion proteins because it has a Zn2+ binding domain at the C-terminal cytosolic side and has an unusually long \u201cstable signal peptide\u201d (SSP) that remains associated to the complex after signal peptidase cleavage. The maturation cleavage to generate the NSU (called GP1) and the CSU (GP2) is carried out by the subtilase SKI-1/S1P in the early Golgi compartment (Burri et al., 2012). The strategy used to obtain the structure combined engineering an \u201cSOS\u201d disulfide bond between GP1 and GP2, introducing a proline residue in the metastable HR1 region of GP2, and mutating the SKI-1/S1P cleavage site between GP1 and GP2 to make it efficiently cleavable by the furin protease present in the producing cells, in this case Schneider 2 Drosophila melanogaster cells. This form of the protein retained the native antigenicity and was recognized by strongly neutralizing antibodies against Lassa virus isolated from survivors of the infection, the majority of which do not recognize the individual GPC subunits expressed separately. The crystals were obtained in complex with the Fab of one of these neutralizing antibodies (Mab 37.38, Figure 2) and yielded diffraction to 3\u00c5 resolution, which is remarkable for this heavily glycosylated protein (27 predicted N-linked glycosylation sites per protomer). As most of the neutralizing antibodies have overlapping epitopes on the GPC trimer and compete with Mab 37.38 for binding, the structure also identifies a main antigenic determinant of the virus. Furthermore, the observed conformation of the Lassa virus prefusion trimer ectodomain observed in the X-ray structure matches that of authentic spikes at the virion surface visualized by cryo-electron tomography and sub-tomogram averaging to about 14 \u00c5 resolution (Li et al., 2016b). The stabilized Lassa virus trimer will thus guide next generation vaccine design against arenaviruses, which constitute a large group of rodent-transmitted hemorrhagic disease viruses distributed worldwide.",

They include flaviviruses such as the mosquito-borne hemorrhagic fever agents dengue and yellow fever viruses, the encephalitic mosquito-borne West Nile and Japanese encephalitis viruses, as well as tick-borne encephalitis viruses. They also include the neurotropic and teratogenic Zika virus. Alphaviruses (Togaviridae family) such as Chikungunya virus, which causes severe arthralgia with joint pain and fever, and the equine encephalitic viruses that spread zoonotically to humans, such as the Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus, are also mosquito-borne class II viruses. Viruses in several families of the recently defined Bunyavirales Order (previously known as Bunyaviridae family), and generically called bunyaviruses, also belong to the class II group. The majority of the bunyaviruses are zoonotic arboviruses, the most studied being the mosquito transmitted Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), which causes hemorrhagic fever and belongs to the Phlebovirus genus (Phenuiviridae family). The Orthobunyavirus genus (Peribunyaviridae family) also includes zoonotic viruses distributed worldwide, the most known being California encephalitis and La Crosse viruses, transmitted by mosquitoes in North America. The Nairoviridae family includes the highly pathogenic tick-borne Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus, classified as a biosafety level 4 pathogen. In addition to the arboviruses, the class II group includes hantaviruses (bunyaviruses of the Hantaviridae family), zoonotic viruses carried by chronically infected rodents and causing severe renal or respiratory syndromes (depending on the virus) in humans.",

The fusion protein folds as a heterodimer with a companion glycoprotein present upstream in the precursor. For ease of description, we term the companion glycoprotein UGP, for \u201cupstream glycoprotein,\u201d and the fusion protein as DGP (\u201cdownstream glycoprotein\u201d). UGP and DGP form a heterodimer in the ER of the infected cell, most likely co-translationally as the UGP is already present in the ER when the DGP emerges from the translocon. Both UGP and DGP are anchored in the viral membrane by their C-terminal ends. Their topology is similar to the type I single transmembrane proteins, except that in some viruses they have two C-terminal trans-membrane segments. They are in general released by signal peptidase cleavage from the polyprotein precursor (Elliott and Schmaljohn, 2013, Kuhn, 2013, Lindenbach et al., 2013), although for some class II viruses other enzymes are also involved, with the most complex processing being that of the nairovirus mature glycoproteins (Altamura et al., 2007)). The UGP/DGP heterodimers interact laterally on the cell membrane to make a large assembly, in many cases with icosahedral symmetry. During morphogenesis in the infected cell, lateral interactions between glycoprotein spikes generate strong curvature in the underlying lipid bilayer, driving particle budding across the cell membrane (Vaney and Rey, 2011). They are thus reminiscent of the COP proteins involved in formation of intracellular vesicles, albeit with reversed topology. The main difference from class I viruses, in which the prefusion trimer assembles independently of the other trimers at the virus surface and its structure can be studied in isolation, is that in class II proteins it is the whole assembly that is important to understand in interaction with antibodies.",

They can also assemble at the cell surface and bud directly across the plasma membrane into the external milieu (alphaviruses, [Kuhn, 2013]). Class II virions undergo a maturation process that primes the viral particle for acid activation for fusion within an endosome of a target cell. In the case of rubella virus and of the bunyaviruses, this maturation has been observed by electron microscopy with clear morphological differences between immature and mature particles (Mangala Prasad et al., 2017, Salanueva et al., 2003), but the actual maturation process is not understood. In the case of flaviviruses and alphaviruses, maturation is proteolytic, via the trans-Golgi network (TGN)-resident furin protease of the infected cell, which cleaves the UGP such that the N-terminal portion is later shed, priming the particle to react upon exposure to acidic pH in the endosome of the target cell to induce fusion (Kuhn, 2013, Lindenbach et al., 2013). This maturation cleavage is analogous to that taking place in class I proteins, priming the fusion machinery by cleavage to form the NSU and CSU, except that in class II viruses it takes place on the companion glycoprotein.",

The heterodimer trimerizes to make (p62/E1)3 spikes, which are transported to the cell surface where they accumulate for subsequent assembly of a glycoprotein shell and budding. Proteolytic maturation in the TGN converts p62 into the mature proteins E3 (N-terminal fragment, a small protein that remains peripherally attached to the spike) and E2. E3 is then lost in the neutral pH of the extracellular environment, priming the spike complex to react to subsequent exposure to acidic pH in the endosome of a target cell. The surface glycoprotein shell of infectious virions contain 80 (E2/E1)3 spikes interacting laterally to make a T = 4 icosahedral lattice encasing the viral membrane (Kuhn, 2013) (Figure 3A, top-middle panel). High-resolution structural studies by X-ray crystallography have provided the structure of the ectodomains of the p62/E1 and E3/E2/E1 complexes of Chikungunya virus at neutral pH (Voss et al., 2010), and the E2/E1 complex of Sindbis virus at acidic pH, in which E1 and E2 remain partially bound and in which the fusion loop of E1 is exposed (Li et al., 2010). There are also sub-nanometer resolution structures by single particle cryo-EM of several alphaviruses, and the combination with the X-ray structures has provided a detailed model of the interactions that form the glycoprotein shell (Sun et al., 2013, Tang et al., 2011, Zhang et al., 2011), showing that the E1 DGP forms the icosahedral scaffold, with E2 capping E1 at the top of each of the spikes and being ideally positioned to interact with cellular receptors. Most of the alphavirus neutralizing antibodies target the exposed E2 cap (Fox et al., 2015, Long et al., 2015, Sun et al., 2013), but some also target E1.",

In contrast to alphaviruses, the flavivirus particle assembles and buds into the ER lumen of the infected cell in the form of an immature particle with 60 trimeric spikes ((prM/E)3) containing trimers of the precursor-membrane protein (prM, the UGP) and the envelope protein (E, the membrane fusion DGP) (Figure 3A, top-left panel). These immature particles are then transported across the secretory pathway, trafficking from the neutral pH environment in the ER into the acidic milieu of the Golgi apparatus. Exposure to this mildly acidic environment triggers a radical conformational change of the particle, such that the 60 trimeric spikes dissociate and reassociate as 90 (prM/E)2 dimers, with prM bound at the E dimer interface (Li et al., 2008b, Yu et al., 2008) (Figure 3A, middle left). In this conformation, a furin specific site in prM becomes exposed, giving rise to proteolytic maturation by furin to yield protein M (the C-terminal, viral-membrane anchor portion) and the peripheral \u201cpr\u201d portion. Mature virions are then released into the extracellular milieu where pr is shed as its affinity for E at neutral pH is weak, thus priming the particle to become infectious upon subsequent exposure to acid pH in the endosome of a target cell. The mature flavivirus particle has a smooth aspect, featuring 90 head-to-tail E dimers organized in a herringbone pattern (Figure 3A), with the fusion loop buried at the E dimer interface (Figure 3C) (Kuhn et al., 2002, Zhang et al., 2013).",

            "text": "The bunyavirus genome is composed of three segments of negative\u2013sense single stranded RNA. The medium segment (M) encodes a polyprotein precursor containing glycoprotein GN in the amino-terminal side (UGP) and GC (the membrane fusion DGP) in the C-terminal side. The first X-ray structure of a bunyavirus fusion protein corresponded to RVFV GC in the prefusion form, which showed that it is a class II protein (Dessau and Modis, 2013). The structure of postfusion GC was later determined for several phleboviruses (Guardado-Calvo et al., 2017, Halldorsson et al., 2016, Zhu et al., 2017. In particular, the structure of RVFV GC in the postfusion form revealed the path of the stem, which was unresolved in the previous structures of arbovirus DGPs, extending from domain III to the fusion loop. The end of the stem interacts with the fusion loop and completes an interaction pocket specific for a glycerophospholipid head group (Guardado-Calvo et al., 2017) at the site of membrane insertion (magenta spheres and arrows in Figure 4). This pocket appears to be also present in the flavivirus and alphavirus DGPs, although these proteins have not yet been visualized in complex with a lipid head group. Of note, a key residue in direct interaction with the lipid head group in RVFV GC occupies the same location as residue 226 in the fusion protein E1 of Chikugunya virus. The A226V mutation in E1 affects the lipid dependence for fusion and coincided with a change of mosquito vector transmitting the virus, in turn causing an explosive outbreak of Chikungunya disease in Reunion Island (Indian Ocean) in 2005 and 2006 (Tsetsarkin et al., 2007), although the mechanistic explanation for this effect remained elusive (Tsetsarkin et al., 2011). The current view is that the lipid composition of the endosomal membranes may vary for different mosquito species, and that minor differences in affinity of the DGP for the lipid head groups may have a big impact in the overall outcome of the infection and the transmission capacity of the infected mosquito.",

Moreover, a cryo-EM reconstruction of the T = 12 icosahedral RVFV particle to about 13\u00c5 resolution was reported recently (Halldorsson et al., 2018). These authors performed a localized 3D reconstruction centered on individual hexamers and pentamers of the T = 12 lattice to extend the resolution locally to about 8\u00c5. The resulting cryo-EM map made possible a clear docking of the available atomic models for GN and GC, thereby revealing the organization of the GC shell on the virion, which provides particle cohesion by forming the contacts between adjacent pentamers and hexamers. It also revealed the capping of the fusion loop by GN at the hexamer and pentamer apices (Figure 3), although the detailed interactions between GN and GC could not be visualized at this resolution. In addition, by using cryo-ET, this study also captured the interaction of virions with liposomes at acid pH (mimicking the pH in the endosomes) at low resolution (around 20 \u00c5). This early stage of the fusogenic conformational change featured a subset of the DGPs on the virion (the GC proteins located around the 5-fold axes of the T = 12 icosahedral particles) which had lost the GN cap and were in an extended intermediate conformation bridging the two membranes, while those at around quasi-6-fold axes of the particle still maintained the GN cap (Halldorsson et al., 2018). This study therefore reported the first structural visualization of a class II fusion protein in the elusive extended intermediate conformation (schematized in the middle panel of Figure 1A for the class I proteins) occurring during the process of membrane fusion.",

UGP capping the DGP, and the interactions with the target cell resulting in the release of the UGP cap in order to project the fusion loop of the DGP into the cellular membrane, function analogously to the functions of the NSU and CSU in the class I proteins. An exception is seen with the flaviviruses, however, where the UGP only partially caps the DGP in the immature form, and the fusion loop then rearranges to become buried the DGP dimer interface in mature particles. This particular organization of the particle has important implications in flavivirus biology and for vaccine design, as discussed below.",

Class III proteins appear as a combination of classes I and II, with a central coiled-coil in the postfusion form, which bears at its N-terminal end a \u03b2 sheet-rich fusion domain that is reminiscent of domain II in class II fusion proteins. However, the connectivity of the secondary structure elements in the respective domains are unrelated. Another difference is that class III proteins do not undergo activating maturation cleavage like the one occurring in class I proteins. But they behave as class I proteins in the sense that they do not make a glycoprotein assembly encasing the viral membrane as class II proteins. Class III proteins were originally identified in the rhabdovirus vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) glycoprotein G (Roche et al., 2006) and in the herpes simplex virus glycoprotein B (gB) (Heldwein et al., 2006) and were later also identified in baculoviruses (Kadlec et al., 2008). Very recently, the structure of class III fusion protein from two thogotoviruses were reported (Peng et al., 2017). Thogotoviruses are a group of arboviruses forming a genus in the Orthomyxoviridae family that also includes the influenza virus genera, which can cause serious disease when infecting humans. Except for VSV G, which was reported in both in prefusion and postfusion forms (Roche et al., 2007), the other class III fusion proteins were crystallized in their postfusion conformation only. The envelope glycoprotein of rabies virus, the type species in the Rhabdoviridae family, is also expected have a class III fold, and structural studies of its prefusion form would be important to understand the way antibodies neutralize this important human pathogen. Similarly, the surface glycoprotein of members of the Bornaviridae family has been suggested to have a class III fusion fold, although this has not been experimentally confirmed. As these viruses have been associated with fatal cases of zoonotic encephalitis (Hoffmann et al., 2015), it would also important to undertake structural studies on members of this family.",

The structure of E2 from representatives of the Pestivirus genus (El Omari et al., 2013, Li et al., 2013) and also the structures of a core fragment of glycoprotein E2 from the hepatitis C virus (HCV) in the Hepacivirus genus (Khan et al., 2014, Kong et al., 2013) showed that they do not have a class II fusion protein fold, and it is not clear how the fusion machinery of these viruses work.

Several very recent studies have revealed ways of eliminating elicitation of such antibodies, which distract the immune system from the production of the relevant bNAbs, by further stabilization of the recombinant Env trimer ectodomain by structure guided mutagenesis (de Taeye et al., 2015, Joyce et al., 2017, Kulp et al., 2017, Torrents de la Pe\u00f1a et al., 2017). Furthermore, recent experiments immunizing rabbits with a SOSIP version of a transmission founder virus succeeded in eliciting antibodies neutralizing heterologous tier 2 viruses, but only with the engineered version that stabilized the closed form and did not expose the V3 loop (Saunders et al., 2017). These results highlight the importance of stabilization of the prefusion form in the closed conformation, limiting as much as possible its dynamic conformational behavior. These approaches remain very challenging, however, as all the identified the bNAbs exhibit very high somatic hypermutation (SHM) and recombinant antibodies with the inferred germline sequence do not bind the virus, except in the rare cases where the Env sequence of the founder virus is known. In this HIV-1 specific context, the available structures have also allowed the engineering of germline-targeting SOSIP trimer variants (Medina-Ram\u00edrez et al., 2017a) that could be used to test immunization of knock-in mice expressing antibodies with the inferred bNAb unmutated ancestor sequence. These experiments involved priming and boosting strategies conceived to shepherd the B cell response toward making the corresponding bNAb. Sequential boosting with stabilized SOSIP trimers having sequences closer and closer to wild-type has indeed led to induction of neutralizing antibodies in these mice with high levels of SHM that recapitulated many of the key mutations in the targeted bNAb, providing the proof of concept that this approach is viable, and can potentially be tried in future vaccine approaches (Escolano et al., 2016, Steichen et al., 2016).",

Similar approaches are likely to be essential for developing efficient immunogens to use in a subunit vaccine against other enveloped viruses from the other classes. Important examples are the human pathogenic Epstein-Barr virus and the cytomegalovirus, belonging to the Herpesviridae family, for which a structure of the prefusion form of their class III fusion protein would be extremely valuable as a target for vaccine design, and where specific stabilization of the pre-fusion form is an absolute requirement.",

Parallels still exist, as indicated by the flavivirus data, and in particular for the four dengue virus serotypes, where heterotypic secondary infection is the greatest risk factor for severe dengue disease (Katzelnick et al., 2017). The antibodies elicited during a primary infection normally protect from subsequent autologous infection; however, these antibodies also bind heterologous virus without neutralizing it. The resulting opsonized particles are efficiently internalized via Fc\u03b3 receptors into macrophages and other cells of the immune system, where the virus particle, which is not neutralized by the bound antibody, fuses with the endosomal membranes and infects the cell in an antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) of the infection. As reviewed recently (Rey et al., 2018), the mechanism behind ADE appears to be related to particle heterogeneity introduced by partial maturation of the UGP as well as conformational dynamics of the fusion protein on the mature virions (illustrated in Figure 3B).",

Furthermore, although the UGP does cap the underlying DGP layer in immature flavivirus particles such that the fusion loop cannot insert into the endosomal membrane, the available structures show that the fusion loop is not buried, but is instead exposed on the sides of the (prM/E)3 spikes (reviewed in (Rey et al., 2018)) such that it is recognized by antibodies and also by B cell receptors. Because furin maturation is often incomplete, partially mature particles (Figure 3B) are released by infected cells and circulate in the host, stimulating B cells to produce antibodies against the laterally exposed fusion loop, and also against the highly immunogenic prM. Both of these classes of antibodies have been shown to be cross-reactive, poorly neutralizing and ADE prone. These antibodies can bind mature heterologous particles only when the conserved fusion loop is exposed, either by dynamic \u201cbreathing\u201d of the E dimer, or in immature patches on the virion. The number of such antibodies coating the particle depends of the breathing kinetics of the E dimers, and is often insufficient to reach the neutralization threshold (Burton et al., 2001). In the absence of other antibodies targeting additional regions of the particle (which is the case during an heterologous infection, since the other exposed regions of the E dimer are variable across serotypes), the non-neutralized virion/antibody complex is internalized via Fc\u03b3 receptors, enhancing the overall infection by accessing to immune cells that are normally not infectable.",

Furthermore, although laboratory adapted strains appear to be highly dynamic, readily exposing the fusion loop (and therefore being easily neutralized by the fusion loop antibodies, similar to the autologous tier 1 HIV-1 strains by the V3 loop antibodies), clinical strains appear to be less dynamic, and only expose the fusion loop at few locations around the particle, such that the stoichiometry required for neutralization is never reached. It is important therefore to design immunogens that avoid eliciting antibodies against the fusion loop and to prM. In addition, a vulnerability site has been identified at the flavivirus surface, precisely in the region of the fusion loop, which is recognized in the context of the E dimer and not via the side chains that are buried at the dimer interface (Dejnirattisai et al., 2015). Antibodies targeting this site, termed \u201cE dimer epitope\u201d (EDE) are capable of potently neutralizing the four dengue viruses as well as Zika virus (Barba-Spaeth et al., 2016). The identification of the EDE site has opened the possibility of designing immunogens that are able to elicit antibodies broadly neutralizing all four dengue viruses as well as Zika virus. Designing such immunogens also requires avoiding exposure of cryptic epitopes, in particular the fusion loop. A step in this direction has been made recently, with cysteine residues introduced at the dimer interface (marked with stars in Figure 3C) that covalently cross-link the E dimer such that the fusion loop is not exposed (Rouvinski et al., 2017). Binding studies have shown that the double-disulfide cross-linked E dimers are efficiently recognized by the EDE bNAbs but not by antibodies targeting the fusion loop. It remains to test the type of immune response induced by these new immunogens, although ideally, the best approach would be to immunize with virion-like particles stabilized in their closed form, exposing exclusively locked E dimers incapable of breathing (such as the one illustrated in Figure 3A), analogous to the engineered HIV Env closed trimers.",

            "text": "A further important insight comes from influenza virus. The structures of HA in complex with broadly neutralizing antibodies targeting the conserved stem region (Ekiert et al., 2009) (Figure 2), which neutralize by blocking the fusogenic conformational change, have shown us how to use the complementarity determining region of the bound antibodies to design small proteins targeting the same site (Fleishman et al., 2011). Further studies identified small peptides targeting this site, with the same potent inhibitory effect (Kadam et al., 2017). These results suggest that it may be possible to identify non-peptidic, orally bioavailable antiviral compounds using the same strategy to treat flu infections. These studies thus pave the way for deriving specific and potent drugs to treat infection by other pathogenic viruses. Structural biology of the viral membrane fusion proteins and their complexes with neutralizing antibodies is thus an exceptionally powerful approach to identify vulnerability sites and to extract the necessary information required to efficiently combat the emerging viral diseases threatening our planet.",

            "text": "Figure\u00a01: Class I Viral Fusion Proteins (A) Linear diagram illustrating the organization of the class I fusion protein polypeptide chain. A precursor glycoprotein is co-translationally translocated into the ER of the infected cell, where it is co- and post-translationally modified by glycosylation (Y symbols) and formation of disulfide bonds (not shown). An ER-resident signal peptidase generates the N terminus of the precursor upon cleavage (left vertical arrow) of the signal sequence (SS), while the precursor remains membrane-anchored through a C-terminal trans-membrane (TM) segment. The precursor folds as a trimer (represented by the three horizontal bars), which undergoes a subsequent proteolytic step (vertical arrow at the center) that generates two mature subunits NSU (N-terminal subunit, blue, red or yellow bars; the colors match the 3D diagrams in (B) and CSU (C-terminal subunit, white, gray or black bars). The two subunits remain associated in the mature trimer, which becomes metastable and primed for the irreversible conformational change that drives membrane fusion for infection of a new cell. The NSU is usually the receptor binding subunit, although in some viruses a separate protein carries this function. The CSU is the viral fusion protein, with a fusion peptide at its N-terminal end (symbolized by a dashed region) and an external membrane-proximal region (MPR) near the TM domain (symbolized by short dashes). (B) Two representative class I fusion proteins in their prefusion conformation shown in surface representation (left panels), with NSU and CSU colored according to panel A. The glycan chains are shown as sticks with carbon atoms cyan and oxygen atoms red. The viral membrane is diagrammed to scale, with the aliphatic moiety in dark beige at the center, dingfa out as it enters the hydrophilic lipid head-group moiety. Left, top panel, structure of a fully-glycosylated, clade B native HIV Env trimer determined by cryo-EM to 4.4\u00c5 resolution (Lee et al., 2016) in the presence of the TM segment (empty arrow) and in complex with bnAb PGT151, which is displayed with the variable domains as green ribbons. The MPR segment and TM region appeared mostly disordered. The bottom left panel shows the cryo-EM structure of the NL63 \u03b1-coronavirus NL63 spike protein ectodomain, determined to 3.4\u00c5 resolution, and displaying clear density for many of the N-linked glycans (Walls et al., 2016b). The prefusion forms display the NSU subunit (S1 in coronaviruses and gp120 in HIV) making a crown (red/yellow/blue) around a spring-loaded CSU (black/gray/white; S2 in coronaviruses and gp41 in HIV). Interactions with the target cell trigger the release of the NSU crown, allowing the CSU to undergo a fusogenic conformational change going through an extended intermediate that bridges the two membranes (represented in the top-middle panel). The hairpin conformation adopted by the CSU (diagrammed at the top right) has the fusion peptide inserted into the membrane next to its TM region. A schematic fused membrane is shown to scale. Immediately below the hairpin is a ribbon representation of the postfusion CSU from SIV (gp41), forming a 6-helix bundle (Yang et al., 1999). The N and C-terminal ends of the gp41 subunit in black are marked. The two lower panels show a representative structure of the coronavirus postfusion CSU trimers displayed as ribbons (middle) and as surface representation (bottom) (Walls et al., 2017) with the N-and C-terminal ends visible in the structure of the ectodomain indicated in blue and red, respectively. A schematic on the ribbon diagram shows the expected location of the missing segments in the intact postfusion protein on membranes (not present in the structure; blue at the N-terminal end, connecting to the fusion peptide inserted superficially on the outer lipid leaflet of the fused membranes, represented as a full blue rectangle) and the C-terminal end in red, connecting to the TM helices and the cytosolic tail.",

The viral membrane is shown in steel-grey (arrows). Left column: Flavivirus particle maturation: Immature flavivirus particles undergo a conformational change in response to exposure to low pH in the Golgi, in which the 60 (prM/E)3 spikes (top panel) reorganize into 90 (prM/E)2 dimers (middle panel) (PDB 3c6R). In this conformation, prM exposes a cleavage site specific for the cellular furin proteinase. Upon cleavage, the peripheral \u201cpr\u201d domain (red, blue and yellow) stays bound as long as the pH is acidic, but is shed from the particle in the neutral pH external environment. Mature flavivirus particles (bottom left) expose the E protein in a herringbone arrangement, completely covering the viral membrane (PDB 5iz7). All structures are shown at the same scale (bar bottom left, 10nm). (B) Flavivirus particle heterogeneity (left panel) arising from incomplete furin maturation. In the case of dengue viruses, the conformational change between the top left and middle left panels in (A) is reversible with pH, whereas the one from the middle to the bottom panel is irreversible. Because furin is membrane bound, the particles are often processed only on the side that is closest to the TGN membrane with the opposite side uncleaved. Upon release into the neutral external environment, the non-processed side returns to the immature conformation, whereas the processed side adopts the mature conformation, giving rise to mosaic particles exposing the fusion loop in the immature patches. A representation of a \u201cbreathing\u201d mature particle (right) shows an expanded size and exposure of the membrane underneath. These particles also expose epitopes normally buried by dimer contacts on virions. (C) Organization of the flavivirus E dimer as present on mature virions as a representative class II DGP (PDB code 5lbv). One subunit is rainbow colored along the polypeptide chain (from N to C terminus, as indicated in the color key bar below), the other is gray. The three structured domains DI, DII and DIII are indicated as well as the fusion loop (FL). Sites where disulfide bridges have been engineered to stabilize the dimer in the prefusion conformation are marked (star and arrow). Scale bar (bottom, right): 1 nm.",

The membrane is represented on the right, roughly to scale, and the N and C-terminal ends of the crystallized ectodomain are labeled in blue and red, respectively.
