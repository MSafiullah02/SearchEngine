The COVID-19 crisis has had a great impact on maxillofacial surgery practice all over the world, but not in the same way. The lack of precise and timely development of universal guidelines has resulted in dangerous and unacceptable healthcare settings in affected countries. This has inevitably resulted in unsafe working conditions, made worse by the lack of PPE and testing capabilities, all leading to high-risk situations for many healthcare workers and patients in many countries. However, it is admirable that almost every centre did its best to optimally face the outbreak. This great effort from the maxillofacial and general medical community has no precedent in history.",

Therefore, in conclusion, it seems appropriate to request that every healthcare institution receives well-researched and documented protocols for dealing with future inevitable global pandemics. These should be developed and vetted by both local and coordinated international healthcare-based organizations. On the basis of these guidelines, each specialty could then develop specific and effective specialty-based guidelines to ensure the safety and wellbeing of providers and patients worldwide.",
