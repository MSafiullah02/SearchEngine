This protein is activated by sulfhydryl groups such as sodium thiosulfate. The primary sequence of the protein is almost identical to that of streptolysin 0 (SLO) (Mengaud et al. 1990) , which means that LLO can be bound by antibodies specific for SLO (Njoku-Obi 1963) . Many researchers have reported that the gene coding for the hemolysin produced by Listeria monocytogenes is at least partly responsible for the organism's virulence (Leimeister-Wachter et al. 1990; Sokolovic et al. 1990 ). When the bacteria escape from a host vacuole, this event is mediated partly by the action of LLO, which forms pores that enable the organism to escape (Mounier et al. '1990) . According to Sokolovic et al. (1990) , this brotein seems to be produced even under heatshock conditions and is the only major extracellular protein produced at this point. To evaluate LLO activity qualitatively, sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS)-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotting using anti-LLO antibodies conjugated with an enzyme such as horseradish peroxidase have been used (Parrisius er al. 1986; Sokolovic er al. 1990 ). However, with these methods, it has been difficult to determine whether LLO is inactivated or actually denatured during a heat treatment such as heat shock. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is a method that can be used for the quantitative analysis of protein because it is specific as well as accurate (Hornbeck 1991; Voller and Bidwell 1986) . It is a procedure that can be expensive, however, inasmuch as it often requires preparation of antibodies specific for the antigen being studied. SLO reagent and anti-SLO (ASO) are standardized commercial products that have been used in hemolytic titrations in the clinic.
