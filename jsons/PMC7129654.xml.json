A PubMed search for the terms \u201cHIV and Israel\u201d lists over 2300 professional papers. The combined total for similar searches of bordering countries and territories (Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, Egypt, and Palestine) is only 964. Indeed, rates of AIDS in Israel are among the highest in the area, and are clearly relevant to any discussion of the problem (Figure 1\n).",
