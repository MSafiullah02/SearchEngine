NATO ensures that Europe\u2019s resources\u2014geographic, demographic, economic, and military\u2014do not supplement the power of an adversary, present or prospective. As long as Europe remains militarily intertwined with the USA and dependent on the latter for its security, Washington will have great influence in Europe. Europe\u2019s dependence on the USA for this elemental need will prevent it from becoming a rival center of power either collectively or because one state achieves dominance on the continent (Art 1996). NATO\u2019s continued existence ensures that Europe remains a strategic subordinate to the USA, which explains why the USA, though it has complained often about inequitable burden sharing, has never demanded a dramatic increase in European military power, let alone a Europe with an autonomous defense policy. Reliable access to NATO countries\u2019 ports, airfields, and intelligence enables the USA to project its military power worldwide, even for missions unrelated to Europe\u2019s defense. NATO provides the veneer and sometimes the substance of multilateralism, which makes US military interventions and stability operations more palatable to other countries. By contributing to a stable, prosperous Europe, NATO also sustains a favorable environment for US trade and investments in what is a lucrative global market.",

            "text": "The proponents of NATO expansion had a significant advantage over the opponents at the outset, for at least three reasons. First, the alliance as a military and institutional enterprise did not need to be created de nouveau. In planning for their security, states, like individuals, prefer to build on the familiar rather than venturing into the unknown by building alternatives from scratch. Second, NATO had been demonstrably successful in protecting and ensuring the stability of its member states for almost half a century. Hence, the proposition that NATO could do for its new members\u2014from Eastern and Central Europe, the Baltics, and the Balkans\u2014what it had done for Western Europe seemed plausible. Countries that sought membership in post-Cold War NATO believed that joining the alliance was crucial to realizing their goals of integrating with the West and protecting themselves from Russia, with which many of them had a troubled history. Third, the balance of power after the Cold War overwhelmingly favored the USA. Russia\u2019s economy and military were in shambles in the 1990s, and it therefore lacked the wherewithal to prevent enlargement.",

The USA has far more resources to mobilize and deploy for defending Europe than do its allies collectively, let alone individually. NATO has always been a unipolar pact. Absent that, NATO could not have incorporated states in Eastern and Central Europe, the Baltic countries, and parts of the Balkans without increases in the defense spending on a scale that the alliance\u2019s European members would not have been willing to undertake. In particular, defending the Baltic states\u2014small, weak countries that adjoin Russian territory\u2014would have been impossible absent US military might. Although the US military presence in Europe has declined from a Cold War highpoint of 4,000,000 troops to just under 79,011 in 2019, it remains essential barring the emergence of a robust common European defense system. But that would require a substantial increase in military spending and capabilities by European states (US Department of Defense 2019).",

US leaders in the executive branch, the legislature, and the foreign policy community more generally (i.e., specialists in universities, the media, and think tanks), general agree that a NATO with strong US leadership was essential for democracy\u2019s success in the alliance\u2019s newest states and that emergence of authoritarian regimes in the states east of NATO\u2019s old perimeter would lead to turmoil there or even war, a denouement that would ill serve US interests. The proponents of NATO enlargement also considered it essential for promoting economic reform and bringing militaries under civilian control in countries that had been part of the Soviet bloc for decades (e.g., US Information Agency 1996; Holbrooke 1995, 41\u201342; Talbott 1997; Albright 1997a). They disagreed with critics who warned that NATO\u2019s eastward expansion would eventually provoke resistance from a resurgent Russia and force the USA to bear the burden involved in protecting several militarily weak states near or adjacent to the Russian border. Beyond that, advocates of reconfiguring NATO after 1991 insisted that it should move out of area to help control conflict, consolidate stability, and advance human rights in countries outside Europe. Included in this new agenda were humanitarian interventions (to stop mass atrocities) and stability operations in countries emerging from civil war.",

            "text": "The proponents of expansion mobilized by forming organizations such as the US Committee to Expand NATO (Goldgeier 1999a, 135\u2013138). They tapped foreign policy luminaries who wielded considerable influence by virtue of their academic expertise, experience in government, and access to the mass media. A prominent example was Zbigniew Brzezinski. A noted authority on the Soviet Union and Russia who served as President Jimmy Carter\u2019s national security advisor, Brzezinski (1994) insisted that expansion was an urgent necessity that had to proceed \u2018with Russian cooperation or without it.\u2019 He warned that the Bill Clinton administration\u2019s failure to act decisively on expansion \u2018could compound the danger that the alliance [might] disintegrate.\u2019 Brzezinski was not alone in offering such dire predictions. Writing about Eastern and Central European states\u2019 desire to join NATO, Henry Kissinger (1994), secretary of state under presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford, warned in an opinion piece:If this request is rejected, and the states bordering Germany are refused protection, Germany will sooner or later seek to achieve its security by national efforts, encountering on the way a Russia pursuing the same policy from its own side. A vacuum between Germany and Russia threatens not only NATO cohesion but the very existence of NATO as a meaningful institution.He reiterated this claim while testifying before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, a forum at which Brzezinski also spoke (GovInfo 1997).",

Consider those who helped to forge a collection of organizations encompassing the political left and right into the Coalition against NATO Expansion (CANE) (\u2018Founding Declaration\u2019 1998). CANE\u2019s founding members were Richard Pipes (a preeminent conservative historian of Russia who had favored adopting a hardline toward the Soviet Union during the Cold War and served as director for East European and Soviet Affairs in the National Security Council under President Ronald Reagan), Jack Matlock (US ambassador to the Soviet Union from April 1987 to August 1991), and Fred Ikl\u00e9 (undersecretary of defense during the Reagan administration). Another opponent of expansion was George F. Kennan, the father of containment, who predicted that pushing ahead with expansion \u2018would inflame the nationalistic, anti-Western, and militaristic tendencies in Russian opinion,\u2026have an adverse effect on the development of Russian democracy,\u2019 and \u2018restore the atmosphere of the Cold War to East\u2013West relations.\u2019 It would, he declared, prove to be \u2018the most fateful error of American foreign policy in the entire post-Cold War era\u2019 (Kennan 1997). Michael Mandelbaum, another prominent participant in the debate on NATO expansion, agreed with Kennan\u2019s critique and made his case in articles, books, and media appearances (1995, 9\u201313, 1996; GovInfo 1997).",

Although senior military officers obviously did not express their concerns publicly, some feared that the USA would be committing itself to the defense of additional countries without added resources at a time when the US military presence in Europe would likely be pared down. William Perry, secretary of defense under President Clinton from February 1994 to January 1997, had a different concern. He did not oppose expansion in principle but believed that it should be delayed and pursued slowly thereafter. Perry worried that rapid expansion would damage the US relationship with Russia and make it harder to gain Russia\u2019s cooperation for further arms control agreements, which he considered essential. In Perry\u2019s view, Russia did not object to the participation of Eastern and Central Europe and the former Soviet republics in the Partnership for Peace (formed in 1994), which was designed to foster military cooperation between NATO and individual countries that were not part of the alliance, and Moscow was itself eager to join that program. But he was convinced that Russia retained \u2018its traditional opposition to Eastern European countries, especially those on its periphery, joining NATO,\u2019 which it still considered \u2018a potential threat.\u2019 According to Perry, \u2018We needed to keep moving forward with Russia\u2026and\u2026NATO enlargement at this time would shove us into reverse.\u2019 His plea for a delay and slow pace was based on the assessment \u2018that we needed more time to bring Russia, the other major nuclear power, into the Western security circle,\u2019 to him \u2018an over-riding priority\u2019 (Perry 2015, 127).",

It was mostly outside\u2019 (Talbott is a prominent, a well-regarded expert on Russia and Clinton\u2019s confidant and Oxford classmate, who served as deputy secretary of state from 1994 to 2001). This should not be surprising. The opponents of expansion never acquired the influence to prevent its launch during the Clinton administration, let alone to derail it once it gained momentum. The proponents of expansion within the government consistently held a stronger hand, not least because President Clinton strongly favored the policy and believed that Russian concerns could be assuaged. Vice President Al Gore\u2019s views aligned with the president\u2019s, and he made them known vigorously. Strobe Talbott also pushed hard for the policy, and his views carried weight for reasons professional (his knowledge of Russia) and personal (his closeness to Clinton) (Talbott 1995, 1997; quoted in Fitchett 1997).",

In her April 1997 testimony to the Senate Armed Services Committee, she offered a spirited defense of the policy and a point-by-point rebuttal of its critics (Albright 1997b). Likewise, according to William J. Burns, Obama\u2019s ambassador to Russia from 2005 to 2008, Anthony Lake, Clinton\u2019s national security advisor, was \u2018an early exponent of expansion.\u2019 Lake argued that it represented \u2018a rare historical opportunity to anchor former Communist countries like Poland, Hungary, and the Czech Republic in a successful and democratic and market economic transition\u2019 and to assuage their fears of a \u2018revanchist Russia.\u2019 This view prevailed because other influential officials shared it, and especially because \u2018it struck a chord with [President] Clinton,\u2019 the man who mattered the most (Burns 2019, 107).

Holbrooke served in top posts within the Clinton administration, including ambassador to Germany (1993\u20131994), assistant secretary of state for Europe (1994\u20131996), and ambassador to the UN (1999\u20132001). He spoke often and with authority. Whereas Perry and the Department of Defense may have fretted about the pace and implications of NATO expansion, Holbrooke brimmed with confidence. According to Goldgeier (1999b), in September 1994, soon after having been appointed assistant secretary of state for Europe, Holbrooke \u2018told a stunned group from the Pentagon the president had stated his support for enlargement and that it was up to them [sic] to act on it\u2026. Over the next three months, as skeptics inside the administration realized that the president, vice president, national security advisor, and secretary of state all supported NATO expansion, the bureaucracy fell into line\u2019 (Goldgeier 1999b, 20). Perry notes in his memoirs that \u2018Holbrooke\u2026proposed in 1996 to bring into NATO at once a number of the PfP [Partnership for Peace] members, including Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, and the Baltic states.\u2019 In opposing Perry\u2019s counsel for delay Holbrooke \u2018was irrepressible and his proposal moved forward,\u2019 especially because \u2018neither Secretary of State Warren Christopher nor National Security Advisor Anthony Lake, spoke out.\u2019 On top of that, Perry recalls, \u2018Vice President Gore\u2026made a forceful argument in favor of immediate membership, an argument more persuasive to the president than mine\u2019 (Perry 2015, 128). Perry observes that \u2018the rupture with Russia may have occurred anyway [i.e., even if he had won the day]. But I am not willing to concede that.\u2019",

Even if Ukraine and Georgia fail to gain entry, NATO\u2019s Baltic members will be nearly impossible to defend and thus the alliance will have to rely on an extended deterrent with dubious credibility. Coyle (2018) of the Atlantic Council sums up the problem starkly: \u2018There is no strategic depth, and the [Baltic] states are only connected to Europe by the 65-kilometer-wide Suwalki Gap. The entire area is covered by Russian Anti-Access Area Denial (A2/AD) capabilities. It would be suicide to try to fight a war with the Kremlin on this territory.\u2019 Moreover, Estonia, Latvia, and Ukraine have sizable ethnic Russian minorities; Georgia and Ukraine are embroiled in border disputes with Russia, battle separatist statelets sustained by Russian material support, and have fought the Russian army. Given the extent of NATO\u2019s military dependence on the USA, Washington will have committed itself to playing the main military role in protecting a collection of states that have scant military resources and whose locations give the Russian army a clear advantage, whether for launching, reinforcing, and resupplying military operations directed at them or for missions aimed at destabilizing them without resorting to war.",

Excluding the USA, in 2019 only four NATO countries spent more than 2% of gross domestic product (GDP) on defense (the guideline that members agreed to at the 2014 Wales Summit). Two were barely above the line, while two others were right on the line. Only two of the alliance\u2019s European members had exceeded that proportion as well as the guideline that called for states to allocate 20% of their military budgets to weaponry. Ten had met neither benchmark. The median for NATO members\u2019 defense spending as a share of GDP\u2014counting the USA, which devoted 3.5 percent\u2014was 1.63 percent (NATO 2019a, graph 2).

The question of whether the USA pledged not to expand NATO remains disputed.

The Russians believed that they had been given an assurance and that the United States later reneged\u2014at a time when Russia was beset by weakness, unable to push back, and did not pose any military threat to Europe. Opponents of NATO expansion had warned that Russia\u2019s leaders would interpret expansion precisely that way and would be unmoved by the argument that it was needed to provide security to and foster democracy in the lands to NATO\u2019s east (Mandelbaum 1996, 1997; GovInfo 1997). After all, Russia was scarcely in a position to attack its western neighbors. During the 1990s, its economy contracted by one-third (Reddaway and Glinski 2001; Rutland 1997) and, in the words of a leading expert on the Russian military, the country \u2018was left with a shambles of an army and a totally confused military doctrine\u2019 (Felgenhauer 1997). As for promoting democracy, it would surely have made sense to apply the underlying logic\u2014namely that military alliances advance democracy and that the latter fosters peace\u2014to Russia, by far the most consequential of the ex-communist countries in Europe. And, as Clinton and his foreign policy team understood, during the Yeltsin years Russia\u2019s democratic experiment was under siege from both the communists (led by Gennady Zyuganov) and the nationalists (such as Vladimir Zhirinovsky), both unrelenting critics of NATO expansion (Berger 2005). There was, to be sure, the prospect of a resurgent Russia, but including it in NATO would have been one way to prevent that outcome from threatening Eastern Europe. That, after all, was the reasoning behind bringing West Germany into NATO following World War Two and a unified Germany into NATO following the Cold War.",

This vision underlay Mikhail Gorbachev\u2019s 1989 proposal to the Council of Europe for restructuring Europe to create \u2018a common home.\u2019 Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, Russian leaders regarded NATO expansion and Russia\u2019s integration into a pan-European security order as incompatible. As Yeltsin explained to Clinton, even reform-minded politicians in Russia would regard NATO expansion.as a sort of neo-isolation of our country in diametric opposition to its natural admission into the Euro-Atlantic space\u2026. We have a different approach, one that leads to a pan-European security system, an approach predicated in collective (but not on the basis of bloc membership) actions\u2026. Security must be indivisible and based on pan-European security structures (National Security Archive 1993).\nUnsurprisingly, Russian leaders regarded NATO enlargement not as a step toward inclusiveness but rather as a repudiation of it. James Collins, charg\u00e9 d\u2019affaires at the US embassy in Moscow and later ambassador to Russia, wrote in a cable to Secretary of State Warren Christopher in 1993\u2014prior to the latter\u2019s visit to Moscow\u2014that the Russians had made clear their fear that NATO expansion would exclude them and therefore strategically bifurcate Europe in a new manner. \u2018No matter how nuanced,\u2019 Collins noted, \u2018if NATO adopts a policy which envisions expansion into Central and Eastern Europe without holding the door open to Russia, it would be universally interpreted in Moscow as directed against Russia and Russia alone\u2014or \u201cNeo-Containment\u201d as Foreign Minister [Andrei] Kozyrev recently suggested\u2019 (National Security Archive 2000).",

In 3 July of that same year, as the Soviet Union was unraveling, a senior delegation from the Russian Federated Soviet Socialist Republic (RSFSR)\u2014which, once the Soviet state dissolved, became the independent Russian Federation\u2014wrote in a memorandum to Boris Yeltsin, who was then the RSFSR\u2019s president, that it had stressed to senior NATO officials that \u2018expanding NATO would be seen negatively in the USSR and the RSFSR\u2019 and that the alliance\u2019s secretary general, Manfred Woerner, had assured his Russian interlocutors that he and the NATO Council were opposed to expansion (National Security Archive 1991). But as discussions about expansion nevertheless proceeded within the alliance, Yeltsin made his objections clear during a December 1993 meeting with Woerner (Chicago Tribune1993). In March 1995, Yeltsin\u2019s foreign minister, Kozyrev, a liberal reformer whom Europe and the USA considered a staunch advocate of partnership with the West, remarked that \u2018whatever one may think of NATO, it\u2019s still a military alliance that was created when Europe was divided\u2026. It should be replaced by a new model based on comprehensive security.\u2019 Kozyrev, echoing Gorbachev, added archly that \u2018the gap between NATO\u2019s very active moves to studying potential enlargement and its passive attitude in developing this new model of comprehensive security is a very wide one, and it could be dangerous\u2019 (quoted in Whitney 1995).",

In addition, Russia\u2019s economic free fall in the 1990s, coupled with the continuing necessity to deploy forces along a vast frontier that abutted 16 countries, rendered a countervailing military response infeasible. Russia\u2019s leaders held a weak hand, but that only served to increase their resentment over what they regarded as the West\u2019s disregard for their legitimate security interests. Their bitterness was not contrived.

In addition, though Putin\u2019s image in the West would change markedly as the new decade advanced (he would come to personify the anti-Western autocrat), in his early years as president he was hopeful about a substantive partnership with NATO, and indeed even membership in the alliance. As the Daily Telegraph, a conservative British newspaper, reported in 2002, \u2018Mr. Putin\u2019s acquiescence to NATO expanding its borders to within 100 miles of his home city, St. Petersburg, was the latest sign of his strategic shift toward the West\u2019 (Warren 2002). Similarly, the Washington Post columnist Charles Krauthammer, also a conservative, wrote an op-ed the same year deriding those who warned that NATO expansion would produce Russian backlash, in which he noted: \u2018In fact the level of US-Russian cooperation is the highest today since 1945. Putin is not just collaborating in the war on terror, not just allowing a US presence in the former Soviet Central Asian states, not just acquiescing to NATO expansion right up to Russia\u2019s border and into Soviet space; he is knocking on NATO\u2019s door, trying to get in\u2019 (Krauthammer 2002).",

The effect on Russian strategic calculations was especially evident once the alliance moved from admitting former members of the Warsaw Pact located in Eastern and Central Europe to admitting the Baltic states, which border Russia, to contemplating the admission of Georgia and Ukraine. It seems inconceivable that the US attitude\u2014or that of any historical power\u2014would have been one of equanimity had an alliance that was once its principal foe started to move toward its borders at a time when it was crippled by weakness. Moreover, a revived USA would surely have pushed back in order preserve its historic sphere of influence. President Vladimir Putin\u2019s strident speech at the 2007 Munich Security Conference, delivered as senior US officials sat in the front rows, symbolized Russia\u2019s resurgence, its determination to resist what it regarded as curtailing of its sphere of influence, and its new strategic outlook. The change cannot be attributed solely to Putin\u2019s personality. Russia\u2019s 2008 war with Georgia occurred during the presidency of Dmitry Medvedev. And it was Medvedev who described the former Soviet republic as part of Russia\u2019s zone of \u2018privileged interests,\u2019 railed against the US-dominated unipolar world, and asserted that Russia\u2019s sphere of influence was not limited to states immediately on its border (New York Times 2008). The Russia\u2013Georgia war\u2014sparked by Georgian leader Mikheil Saakashvili shelling the capital of the Russian-backed breakaway enclave of North Ossetia\u2014and Russia\u2019s annexation of the Crimea and support of separatists in eastern Ukraine in 2014 demonstrated that Russia had acquired the will and wherewithal to push back against the West and that it had carried out a strategic reassessment that bore little, if any, resemblance to the worldviews of Yeltsin and the early Putin.",

The gist of that thesis is that the West bears the blame because it serially provoked Russia following the end of the Cold War by expanding NATO without regard to Russian security interests. The USA and its Western allies assured Ukraine that it would join NATO one day. The EU launched its Eastern Partnership, the plan designed to draw post-Soviet states toward it, even though Russia perceived a huge overlap in the membership rosters of the EU and NATO, which was among the reasons for its antipathy to the Eastern Partnership. The USA vocally supported the 2014 Maidan Revolution that ousted the pro-Russian Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych, and as it unfolded a senior US foreign policy official visiting Kyiv even discussed with the US ambassador to Ukraine the composition of the future Ukrainian cabinet (BBC News 2014). To the Russian leadership this amounted to interference in Ukraine\u2019s domestic politics that was aimed at aligning Ukraine with the West. The West also failed to consider how repeated invasions across Russia\u2019s western frontier had made its leaders acutely sensitive to the strategic trajectories of states on its western flank. One can disagree in whole or part with the argument that the West is to blame and still conclude that the shadow of NATO expansion loomed over the 2014 Ukraine crisis and shaped its course and outcome.",

According to the insider account of Mikhail Zygar, a respected Russian journalist and former editor of Russia\u2019s sole independent television network, \u2018He [Putin] was furious that NATO was still keeping Ukraine and Georgia hanging on by approving the prospect of future membership.\u2019 Zygar writes that Putin \u2018flew into a rage\u2019 and warned that \u2018if Ukraine joins NATO it will do so without Crimea and the eastern regions. It will simply fall apart\u2019 (Zygar 2016, 153\u2013154). As the protests against Yanukovych gained strength in 2014, it was not unreasonable for Russia\u2019s leaders to fear that his ouster and the advent of a pro-Western leader would substantially increase the odds of Ukraine eventually entering NATO. In the eyes of Russian leaders the Ukrainian opposition\u2019s rejection of the EU-brokered deal, which involved major concessions by Yanukovych, including early elections, was proof that the Maidan movement, with Washington\u2019s fulsome support, was determined to topple him so as to align Ukraine with the West (Menon and Rumer 2015). Russia\u2019s annexation of Crimea, Ukraine\u2019s sole Russian-majority province, was doubtless unlawful, but Russia had never attempted to seize Crimea before, even when a Ukrainian government hostile to it took power following the 2004 Orange Revolution. Its decision to take that provocative step in 2014 cannot be understood apart from the Maidan movement, which, in Russian eyes, had as one of its objectives the integration of Ukraine with the West, not just economically but militarily as well.",

We will respond appropriately to such steps, which pose a direct threat to Russia\u2019 (Osborn 2018). Putin may be bluffing in an attempt to block the two countries\u2019 entry into the alliance by trying to unnerve the alliance or create dissension in its ranks. He may be playing to the domestic galleries to burnish his nationalist credentials and strongman image. Perhaps Russia would have been deterred from doing what it did in 2008 and 2014 had Georgia and Ukraine been inside NATO and the lesson is that admitting them will not prove dangerous. These are reasonable suppositions. But sound strategy requires thinking hard about what might happen if things unfold in unexpected ways, what responses are feasible if that happens, and what risks are associated with implementing those responses. Now that NATO expansion has become integral to US grand strategy, the task is to figure out what, if any, limits should apply and whether the costs associated with NATO assuming added obligations serve US interests.",

One way forward might have been the creation of a new pan-European security architecture that included Russia and perhaps even used NATO as a foundation to start with. But a project of that scope never became a serious proposition in the West, let alone an element in US grand strategy (Hill 2018). When Gorbachev floated the idea\u2014\u2018We propose to join NATO\u2019\u2014it went nowhere. President George H.W. Bush\u2019s Secretary of State, James Baker, reportedly dismissed it as \u2018a dream.\u2019 Russian membership in NATO was broached again by President Boris Yeltsin in a December 1991 letter to President George H.W. Bush and in 1993. Vladimir Putin also raised the possibility with President Clinton during the latter\u2019s visit to Moscow in 2000 (Gorbachev and Baker quoted in Roache 2019; New York Times 1991; RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty 2017); Monitor 2000). These feelers came to naught. The Eastern and Central European countries that joined NATO regarded it as a means to protect themselves against Russia, not as a forum for partnership with Moscow, and they would almost certainly have blocked Russian membership, and a consensus was required for admitting new members. Perhaps the attempt to create a new European order that included Russia would have failed; perhaps Russia would have subverted it from within. There is no way to know because, in sharp contrast to what happened following World War Two, Western leaders did not try to conceptualize, let alone create, any such security order, nor did the USA provide the leadership that would have been required to make that possible.",

In this scenario, new EU members would have pledged to participate in these measures as the price for benefitting from a collaborative European system. NATO could have been kept in place as a hedge, but not expanded. Talks between the EU and Russia might have been held to promote and deepen security cooperation, including reductions and pullbacks of Russian forces facing Europe and confidence-building measures designed to prevent the outbreak of war and facilitate the management of crises. Sufficient progress on that front could have laid the groundwork for a pan-European security order that included Russia.

Further, Georgia is a security liability despite its contributions and brave sacrifices in missions like Afghanistan.

Its economy ranks 118th in the world in terms of GDP and is half the size of the smallest state economy in the USA, Vermont\u2019s (World Bank 2019; Forbes 2019). Georgia\u2019s economic situation is mixed. It fares well on the Economic Freedom of the World rankings, at 12th\u2014an indicator that correlates with positive economic outcomes. But a recent report by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace reveals the other side of the coin, including slow growth, stagnating living standards, a high poverty rate, and lack of diversity in the economy (Gwartney et al. 2019; Stronski and Vreeman 2017). Lack of economic opportunity in Georgia has led to high rates of emigration, and the birth rate is insufficient to maintain the current population size (World Bank 2019). In sum, Georgia has some ability to contribute to NATO but hardly enough to matter for an alliance of wealthy and populous countries that spends a trillion dollars on its military forces\u2014and certainly not enough to justify the resources needed to defend it, let alone the significant risks.",

            "text": "Ukraine is likewise a problematic partner, even though its economic and military resources exceed Georgia\u2019s. Nearly the size of Texas, Ukraine contains 44 million people (CIA 2020). Its GDP, $131 billion, ranks 58th, and its per capita GDP is only just over $3000. Its economic weight is comparable to Nebraska\u2019s (World Bank 2019; Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis 2020). Corruption stunts Ukraine\u2019s economic development. World Bank data show that (in constant 2010 dollars) Ukraine\u2019s GDP contracted from roughly $200 billion at the end of the Cold War to $131 billion in 2018 (World Bank 2019). As the Washington Post notes:The combination of corruption, economic mismanagement, the ongoing civil war against Russian-supported rebels, and did we mention the corruption, have all left Ukraine\u2019s economy in worse shape today than it was when the USSR still existed. It seems almost impossible to believe, but Ukraine\u2019s GDP is actually 24 percent smaller now than it was in 1993\u2014the first year we have reliable figures for it\u2014and average incomes are 17 percent lower (O\u2019Brien 2019).\nMilitarily, Ukraine has countered Russian intervention in Donbas resolutely. Still, as Denys Kiryukhin notes, Ukraine\u2019s \u2018military potential remains vastly inferior to that of its primary adversary: Russia\u2019 (2018). This is not surprising. Ukraine spent only $4.4 billion on defense in 2018 (in constant 2017 dollars) and fielded 204,000 troops (SIPRI 2020; IISS 2018). True, recent reforms have paid some dividends. Valeriy Akimenko observes that \u2018the country\u2019s armed forces are larger and better equipped than ever before\u2026. The military budget is set to rise by more than one-quarter in 2018. And, just as importantly, morale has improved.\u2019 Yet he adds:Major problems remain, all of which stem from Ukraine\u2019s internal political struggles and the continuing weakness of state structures. They include the lack of civilian and parliamentary oversight of the armed forces; incomplete integration of volunteers into the regular army; impunity and abusive behavior in the conflict zone; and systemic corruption and opaque budgets, especially in Ukroboronprom, the state-owned defense-industry monopoly (Akimenko 2018).\nThe upshot: Ukraine, though more capable than Georgia, will add to NATO\u2019s militarily capabilities only at the margins. But that benefit will be far outweighed by the risks that the alliance will assume to defend it.",

In assessing the Russia-Georgia war, Kofman (2018) concludes:Russia won, but the Russian military simply was not set up to fight a modern war, even against a smaller neighbor, much less a peer competitor\u2026. The war revealed profound deficiencies in the Russian armed forces. Moscow was surprised by the poor performance of its air power, and more importantly the inability of different services to work together. It truly was the last war of a legacy force, inherited from the Soviet Union. The conflict uncovered glaring gaps in capability, problems with command and control, and poor intelligence.\nRussia has fought differently in Ukraine and Syria. \u2018Moscow,\u2019 Kofman (2017), argued in an earlier piece, \u2018has applied force sparingly, leveraging the local population, its own volunteers, and the militias of allies\u2019 to meets its goals. But this is a far cry from the type of conflict that it would be forced to fight to existentially challenge NATO in any of its major member states whose defeat would represent a serious threat to the US interests (e.g., France, Germany, or even Poland). Kofman\u2019s assessment confirms this. He notes in reference to Ukraine that \u2018Russia lacked the force, the money, and the military experience to attempt any large-scale operation.\u2019",

A European Parliamentary Research Service study summed it up well:Economic recovery [in Russia] has been anemic, with growth likely to remain below 2% for the next few years. Forecasts suggest that Russia\u2019s share of the global economy will continue to shrink, and that it will lag ever further behind the world\u2019s more advanced economies. External factors such as sanctions certainly weigh on Russia\u2019s economy, but the main barriers to growth come from inside the country and are the result of long-standing problems, many originating in the Soviet period or even further back. Despite market-economy reforms in the early 1990s, Russia remains dominated by large and inefficient state-controlled enterprises. Reforms have improved the regulatory environment and cut red tape, but these gains have not been matched by progress in tackling corruption, which remains a major scourge for business. In terms of human capital, a catastrophic shrinkage in the size of the workforce caused by low birthrates is expected to hold back economic growth. Inequality remains high, and economic recovery has not yet benefited the nearly 20 million Russians living in poverty. A low level of competitiveness correlates with a general lack of innovation, low levels of investment and reliance on natural-resource exports (Russell 2018).\nThe USA should nevertheless take Russia seriously. It is a force to be reckoned with, particularly in adjoining regions (like the Baltic states) and in Syria. Russia can still create trouble for its neighbors and further abroad, including via small investments that cause internal challenges in the West (such as election meddling using misinformation). However, none of this warrants the type of threat inflation that presents Russia as a huge problem for the USA or its primary European allies. The USA can safely and confidently deter Russia given the two countries\u2019 relative strength. But this does not mean that NATO should overextend itself by assuming responsibility for defending weak states on the Russian border.",

President Emmanuel Macron of France argued at the 2020 Munich Security Conference:We need some freedom of action in Europe. We need to develop our own strategy. We don\u2019t have the same geographic conditions (as the US), not the same ideas about social equilibrium, about social welfare. There are ideals we have to defend. Mediterranean policy: that is a European thing, not a trans-Atlantic thing, and the same goes for Russia\u2014we need a European policy, not just a trans-Atlantic policy (Deutsche Welle2020).But would such changes be desirable? Some US realists might worry that ending US primacy in Europe and allowing the development of a European superstate could give rise to the type of Eurasian hegemon that Americans have traditionally fought to prevent (Spykman 1942). They would prefer that Europe remain relatively weak, divided, and dependent on the USA, while the latter maintains its hegemonic position on the continent. But other realists would see advantages for the USA if Europe were to forge a common defense policy and increase its defense capabilities. These include a reduced responsibility for ensuring stability and security in Europe and the capacity to better focus on East Asia as China continues its rise. The latter type of realist would rest assured that Eurasia\u2019s main centers of power\u2014Europe, Russia, and East Asia\u2014will remain divided and preoccupied with one another and therefore unable to challenge the USA. This should certainly be the case between Russia and China, unlikely allies absent a perceived threat from the USA that pushes them closer. As for nonrealists, they would be less concerned about a more vigorous Europe, even a European superstate, given their assumption that shared democratic values and norms and economic interdependence will create a peaceful Western community. In that case, a European superstate would be a partner, not the foe traditional balance of power theorists might worry about.",
