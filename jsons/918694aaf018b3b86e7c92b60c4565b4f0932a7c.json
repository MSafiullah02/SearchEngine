These structures generally regroup multiple elements, as well as their attributes. Most attempts rely on translation encoder-decoder methods which linearize elements into a sequence. This however loses most of the structure contained in the data. In this work, we propose to overpass this limitation with a hierarchical model that encodes the data-structure at the element-level and the structure level. Evaluations on RotoWire show the effectiveness of our model w.r.t. qualitative and quantitative metrics.",

Recently, numerous works have focused on leveraging structured data in various applications, such as question answering [24, 34] or table retrieval [7, 32] . One emerging research field consists in transcribing data-structures into natural language in order to ease their understandablity and their usablity.

            "text": "Designing data-to-text models gives rise to two main challenges: (1) understanding structured data and (2) generating associated descriptions. Recent data-to-text models [18, 28, 29, 39] mostly rely on an encoder-decoder architecture [2] in which the data-structure is first encoded sequentially into a fixed-size vectorial representation by an encoder. Then, a decoder generates words conditioned on this representation. With the introduction of the attention mechanism [19] on one hand, which computes a context focused on important elements from the input at each decoding step and, on the other hand, the copy mechanism [11, 33] to deal with unknown or rare words, these systems produce fluent and domain comprehensive texts. For instance, Roberti et al. [31] train a character-wise encoder-decoder to generate descriptions of restaurants based on their attributes, while Puduppully et al. [28] design a more complex two-step decoder: they first generate a plan of elements to be mentioned, and then condition text generation on this plan. Although previous work yield overall good results, we identify two important caveats, that hinder precision (i.e. factual mentions) in the descriptions:",

In parallel, an emerging task, called \"data-to-text\", aims at describing structured data into a natural language description.

For instance, they propose a dual encoder [17] which encodes separately the sequence of element names and the sequence of element values.

First, instead of flatly concatenating elements from the data-structure and encoding them as a sequence [18, 28, 39] , we constrain the encoding to the underlying structure of the input data, so that the delimitation between entities remains clear throughout the process. Second, unlike all works in the domain, we exploit the Transformer architecture [36] and leverage its particularity to directly compare elements with each others in order to avoid arbitrary assumptions on their ordering. Finally, in contrast to [5, 29] that use a complex updating mechanism to obtain a dynamic representation of the input data and its entities, we argue that explicit hierarchical encoding naturally guides the decoding process via hierarchical attention.",

Results are compared to baselines [28, 29, 39] and variants of our models. We also report the result of the oracle (metrics on the gold descriptions). Please note that gold descriptions trivially obtain 100% on all metrics expect RG, as they are all based on comparison with themselves. RG scores are different, as the IE system is imperfect and fails to extract accurate entities 4% of the time. RG-# is an absolute count. Ablation Studies. To evaluate the impact of our model components, we first compare scenarios Flat, Hierarchical-k, and Hierarchical-kv. As shown in Table 1 , we can see the lower results obtained by the Flat scenario compared to the other scenarios (e.g. BLEU 16.7 vs. 17.5 for resp. Flat and Hierarchical-k ), suggesting the effectiveness of encoding the data-structure using a hierarchy. This is expected, as losing explicit delimitation between entities makes it harder a) for the encoder to encode semantics of the objects contained in the table and b) for the attention mechanism to extract salient entities/records. Second, the comparison between scenario Hierarchical-kv and Hierarchical-k shows that omitting entirely the influence of the record values in the attention mechanism is more effective: this last variant performs slightly better in all metrics excepted CS-R%, reinforcing our intuition that focusing on the structure modeling is an important part of data encoding as well as confirming the intuition explained in Sect. 3.3: once an entity is selected, facts about this entity are relevant based on their key, not value which might add noise. To illustrate this intuition, we depict in Fig. 3 attention scores (recall \u03b1 i,t and \u03b2 i,j,t from Eqs. (5) and (6)) for both variants Hierarchical-kv and Hierarchical-k. We particularly focus on the timestamp where the models should mention the number of points scored during the first quarter of the game. Scores of Hierarchical-k are sharp, with all of the weight on the correct record (PTS QTR1, 26) whereas scores of Hierarchical-kv are more distributed over all PTS QTR records, ultimately failing to retrieve the correct one.",

This means that our models learns to generate fluent sequences of words, close to the gold descriptions, adequately picking up on domain lingo. Qualitative metrics are either better or on par with baselines. We show in Fig. 4 a text generated by our best model, which can be directly compared to the gold Fig. 1 .

            "text": "\u2022 The comparison with Puduppully-updt shows that dynamically updating the encoding across the generation process can lead to better Content Ordering (CO) and RG-P%. However, this does not help with Content Selection (CS) since our best model Hierarchical-k obtains slightly better scores. Indeed, Puduppullyupdt updates representations after each mention allowing to keep track of the mention history. This guides the ordering of mentions (CO metric), each step limiting more the number of candidate mentions (increasing RG-P%). In contrast, our model encodes saliency among records/entities more effectively (CS metric). We note that while our model encodes the data-structure once and for all, Puduppully-updt recomputes, via the updates, the encoding at each step and therefore significantly increases computation complexity. Combined with their RG-# score of 30.11, we argue that our model is simpler, and obtains fluent description with accurate mentions in a more human-like fashion.",

We note that our scenarios relies on a lower number of parameters (14 millions) compared to all baselines (ranging from 23 to 45 millions). This outlines the effectiveness in the design of our model relying on a structure encoding, in contrast to other approach that try to learn the structure of data/descriptions from a linearized encoding.",

This results in an effective and more light-weight model. Experimental evaluation on the RotoWire benchmark shows that our model outperforms competitive baselines in terms of BLEU score and is generally better on qualitative metrics. This way of representing structured databases may lead to automatic inference and enrichment, e.g., by comparing entities. This direction could be driven by very recent operation-guided networks [21, 35] . In addition, we note that our approach can still lead to erroneous facts or even hallucinations. An interesting perspective might be to further constrain the model on the data structure in order to prevent inaccurate of even contradictory descriptions.",
