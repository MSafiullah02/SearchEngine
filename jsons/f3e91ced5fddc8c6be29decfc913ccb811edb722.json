Local and national governments worldwide have employed a variety of nonpharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) to mitigate the impact of this novel coronavirus. Mandated policies including limitations on mass gatherings, business closures, and stay-at-home orders have aimed to encourage social distancing and flatten the curve. [2] [3] [4] As of April 30, 2020, over 3,249,000 COVID-19 cases have been confirmed worldwide, with more than 1,067,000 cases and 62,000 resulting deaths in the United States. 5 In an effort to contain the virus, broad shutdowns have resulted in severe economic impacts including 26 million Americans filing for unemployment within a 5 week period. 6 Simultaneously, there is concern that quarantine puts people at increased risk of domestic violence and severe psychological suffering, as well as physical inactivity, weight gain, behavioral addiction disorders, and insufficient sunlight exposure. [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] It is therefore important to quantify the effects of social distancing measures on disease spread in order to guide future policy decisions which may continue to limit economic security and healthy lifestyles.",

Furthermore, efforts to quantify the effects on transmission have not accounted for different stages of disease burden, discounting that the efficacy of policy changes will likely differ if they are instituted in the context of 20 cases or 10,000. This study accounts for the stage of disease spread by selecting a normalized point on the epidemic curve, analyzing each state in the week following its 500th case and assessing how different NPIs influence the burgeoning case load.",

Previous characterization of disease burden across research studies and news sources has largely relied on the metrics of cumulative case and death counts; however, these metrics are unidirectional and do not account for bidirectional changes in the rate of viral transmission over time, a much more powerful metric for predicting an epidemic's trajectory. In this study, we examine effective reproduction number (Rt) as the primary metric of disease burden, which describes the virus's transmission potential in real-time and can thus account for the impact of contextual changes in policy and behavior on disease spread.",

Interestingly, they found 'lockdowns' to be among the least effective policies in mitigating disease spread. 2 Analysis at the city level in China has also associated comprehensive social distancing measures with preventing disease spread. 23, 24 In Wuhan, a reduction in Rt was shown to chronologically follow implementation of traffic restrictions, home confinement, centralized quarantine, and other social distancing measures. 23 The United States presents unique challenges in epidemiological management due to its governmental emphasis on state and local autonomy. As such, an analysis of the pandemic's impact in the U.S. should account for potentially different trajectories across states and at the local level. Outside of China, local-level studies exploring the effectiveness of NPIs have been scarce, and more granular analysis across U.S. states is currently warranted. 22, [26] [27] Ebell & Bagwell-Adams compared differences in social distancing measures employed by counties in the state of Georgia. They demonstrated that Clarke County, which implemented a shelter in place policy two weeks before it was adopted at the state level, had increased case doubling time compared to surrounding counties and the state as a whole. 22 Siedner et al. performed a time-series analysis to compare disease spread before and after statewide social distancing policies were put in place, and found that decreases in epidemic growth rates were shown to occur four days after implementation of each state's first social distancing policy. 28 However, in this section of their analysis the authors did not differentiate between alternate social distancing measures. Additionally, once an initial policy was in place, they found no significant effect of further enacting statewide lockdowns. 28 In this study, we compare the effects of different policies, finding stay-at-home orders to be most effective in reducing transmission. Furthermore, by normalizing disease burden across states to 500 cases, we standardize the time point in each state's outbreak.",

Stay-at-home orders further reduced movement in their study as well. 3 By including cell phone tracking data made publicly available by Google, this study directly assesses the connection between mobility and virus transmission at the state level. In agreement with Lasry et al., we demonstrate that stay-athome orders significantly increase the amount of time people spend at home. 3 Further, our multivariable linear regression analysis, which demonstrates that percent time spent at home was the most significant modulator of Rt, indicates that the primary driving factor in reducing viral transmission was limiting mobility. In conjunction, these results provide evidence that NPIs can be useful in controlling COVID-19 outbreak by effectively reducing social mobility.",

This measure both reduced transmission rate and increased doubling time from 500 to 1000 cases within states. Comparatively, mass gathering restrictions had the least effect on reducing Rt across states. As several states across the U.S. prepare to ease social distancing restrictions in the coming weeks, our results suggest that mass gathering restrictions alone may have less of an effect in maintaining Rt values below 1. Careful monitoring of Rt values in these states may be necessary to proactively identify and control potential recurrent outbreaks.",

We found that reduction in average Rt the week following stay-at-home order was consistent across variation in number of cases at the time of policy implementation. States benefited from similar reduction in Rt regardless of how many confirmed cases they had before their stay-at-home orders went into effect. However, this finding does not imply that timing of stay-at-home order is unimportant, since high Rt in the weeks prior will contribute to greater overall caseload. Furthermore, when looking at more recent Rt averages for the week of April 23rd to April 30th, states that have yet to implement a state-wide stay-at-home order currently have amongst the highest values in the country, accounting for four of the eight states with an average Rt > 1, suggesting that they have not yet successfully contained the virus.",

This lack of association may be a result of studying outcomes early on in each state's disease outbreak. During this relatively early timeframe, states may not have reached hospital capacity yet. Future studies that look at death rates later on may find that social distancing measures help prevent overflow of healthcare systems, and therefore reduce fatality. At this time, more longitudinal data is warranted to more accurately characterize the relationship between social distancing efforts and these lagging indicators of disease burden.",

Disease modeling has indicated that social distancing is a critical measure to achieve this goal, but few studies have validated this finding with emerging case data. Furthermore, few have analyzed epidemiology across states in the country with the largest disease burden, the United States. This study indicates that stay-at-home orders, limitations on mass gatherings, educational facility closures, and non-essential businesses closures are all effective measures at reducing transmission rates thereby flattening the curve. Among these policies, stay-at-home orders had the largest effect, and as states aim to step down from such policies metrics of disease transmission should be carefully monitored to limit recurrent outbreaks. Ultimately, adherence to social distancing appears to be the driving force behind these policies, as states with stay-at-home orders but poor adherence were found to experience similar outcomes to those without such policies. By more rigorously characterizing the state-level strategies that have proved most effective at reducing disease burden, this study aims to provide stakeholders with a more standardized, data-driven framework to guide future policy decisions.",
