Reductions in workforce of anesthesia providers and other staff whosupport practices are a standard, although feared, response to the short-term reduction in nonessential procedure workload. Small- to medium-sized private practice groups whose professional compensation is directly linked to payment for services may be forced to reduce staffing levels more quickly than larger practices and those with other payment arrangements. In a practice arrangement that supports physician anesthesiologists, certified registerednurse anesthetists (CRNAs), and anesthesiologist assistants, decisions regarding the number and type of anesthesia professionals who are furloughed (laid off) arechallenging and stressful for practice leaders. Planning for when or if they can be rehired is not feasible until the pandemic subsides. Anesthesia professionals employed by large academic medical centers and health systems may be relatively more protected from labor force reductions during the initial wave of COVID-19 response due to the overall diversity of services and financial structure of these organizations.",

There will be differences in impact depending on the various types of services delivered by attending anesthesiologists and their trainees. For example, pain medicine specialists with limited critical care or surgical experience may be wellpositioned to offer consultations using telemedicine technologies, while anesthesiologists who primarily work in ambulatory surgery settings will be more impacted by the sudden reduction and delays in resuming nonessential surgical procedures. Short-term demand for some essential procedures with some flexibility to preschedule, notably those related to normal labor and delivery, have increased temporarily in preparation for anticipated COVID-19 cases. However, the relative number of these proceduresis low in comparison to the overall workload reductions from canceling or delaying nonessential procedures.",

They are anticipated to remain in short supply as the pandemic grows. The impact of this shock is a reduction in the supply of anesthesia services because it reduces the ability of providers to deliver care using the same types of inputs. Lower availability of some inputs will have a more dramatic impact on anesthesia services than others, such as the conversions of anesthesia equipment for use as ventilators. In the shortterm, this equipment cannot be used to support perioperative care. In a quick response, 3-dimensional (3D) printers have been used to improvise on parts needed to supplement existing machines or repair equipment that was out of service.",

The response to increase the supply of ventilators during the current pandemic has come from nontraditional manufacturers, including firms in the automobile and vacuum cleaner industry,17 which may lead to further innovations through the expanded diversity of design and engineering of new equipment. The influx of new ventilators will remain in the marketplace even after the pandemic subsides, and this equipment can continue to support anesthesia services as either reserve supply or to replace older ventilators.",
