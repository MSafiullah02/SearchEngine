These findings correspond with other studies in which virus antigen was identified by immunohistochemistry in macrophages of the lung and other organs, tingible body macrophages and dendritic cells of lymphatic organs ( Magar et al., 1993;\nHalbur et al., 1994, 1996;\nLarochelle and Magar, 1995;\nRossow et al., 1996;\nDuan et al., 1997b). Evidence for virus replication within those cell types was also obtained by in situ hybridization (\nHaynes et al., 1997;\nLawson et al., 1997). Both antigen and RNA of PRRSV was also observed in macrophages of other organs, such as nasal turbinates, heart, liver, kidney, adrenal gland and brain. Macrophages are widely distributed in all organs (mononuclear phagocyte system;\nVan Furth, 1980), which makes the systemic character of the PRRSV infection comprehensible. The infection affects especially lymphatic organs and the lung because of the high number of target cells. However, the susceptibility for PRRSV varies among types of macrophages. PRRSV has a strongly restricted tropism for only some subpopulations of porcine monocytes/macrophages (\nDuan et al., 1997a).",

These results indicate that the first phase of infection is characterized by an acute infection of the lymphatic organs, in which the virus replicates in many cells. This early acute infection is accompanied by fever, as shown previously ( Fichtner et al., 1993). We detected infected cells in all the lymphatic organs examined, although not at all sites and to somewhat variable levels. This acute lymphatic organ phase diminished by the onset of the second week p.i. There were fewer infected cells in groups 2 and 3, inoculated with PRRSV isolate Cobbelsdorf, than in group 1, for which I10 was used. Additionally, the animals in this group were younger at the time of infection than those in groups 2 and 3. This may be one of the important factors for the spread of the virus. The pigs used for groups 2 and 3 were infected at the age of 8 weeks. Possibly the resistance to infection increases with the age of the animals.

This phase is characterized by a rapid increase in infected macrophages.2A delayed acute infection of lung macrophages follows. A small number of macrophages becomes infected at an early point in time. The infection spreads slowly to a peak, which is reached 2\u20133 weeks p.i. and involves numerous cells. At that time, the acute infection of lymphatic tissues has diminished to only a few cells containing virus antigen. Highly virulent virus isolates reach a peak of infection more rapidly than isolates with moderate or low virulence.3A late persistent infection with restricted virus replication lasts several months. In this phase, attempts to isolate the virus are in most cases unsuccessful.\n",

            "text": "The exposure of mucosal surfaces to PRRSV results in an infection of residential macrophages, where the initial replication of PRRSV takes place ( Rossow, 1998). Following oronasal inoculation or natural infection, an initial viraemia develops quickly. This viraemia is probably induced by virus replication in subepithelial macrophages of nasal and pharyngeal mucosa. In addition, macrophages located directly beyond the crypt epithelia of the tonsils could be a major target for infection. The pathogenesis of pneumonic lesions may be initiated by a small number of alveolar macrophages which are infected early during viraemia. The multifocal spread of the virus within the lung supports this conclusion. In addition, the infection may spread directly by the respiratory route. In the following days, more alveolar macrophages are probably infected via viraemia or locally by virus released from already infected macrophages. It is unlikely that blood monocytes are involved in the shift of infection to the lung because they are hardly susceptible (\nDuan et al., 1997a).",

            "text": "The lesions in the lung are characterized by an accumulation of macrophages in alveoli. Type II pneumocytes show hyperplasia, hypertrophy and desquamation. The septa are only infiltrated to a small extent by mononuclear cells. Taken together, these criteria are typical for an acute interstitial pneumonia as described for the respiratory form of PRRS ( Ohlinger et al., 1991;\nPol et al., 1991;\nCollins et al., 1992;\nYoon et al., 1992;\nHalbur et al., 1993, 1995;\nRossow et al., 1994, 1995). Numerous antigen\u2010positive alveolar macrophages form clusters and their nuclei show pyknosis and karyorrhexis. A part of these cells might be apoptotic, like in tissue culture after PRRSV infection (\nSuarez et al., 1996). We have no evidence that PRRSV can replicate in type II pneumocytes. Therefore, an immediate damage of alveolar cells by the virus infection is unlikely. It is conceivable that the infection and necrosis of alveolar macrophages lead to desquamation of alveolar epithelia and, thus, the production of surfactant could be impaired at an early stage. The repair of alveolar epithelial cells involves proliferation of type II pneumocytes. We suggest that hyperplasia of these cells is caused by an overshooting reaction and a dysregulation associated with the inflammatory process. Further studies will be of interest to elucidate the pathogenetic mechanisms which regulate the cellular responses to pneumonic lesions and local immune reactions.",
