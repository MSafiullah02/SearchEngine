The deliberate release of anthrax in the aftermath of the events of Sept 11, 2001, highlighted another dimension of microbial threats. Neither event was adequately addressed in the previous IHR of 1969.2\n",

Indeed, there was disincentive to reporting under the IHR because unaffected countries applied travel and trade restrictions far in excess of the true risks of the disease. The new IHR 2005 goes some way toward addressing these issues by establishing expert panels to review the risks to international public health and recommend evidence-based control measures. However, even the revised IHR show an inevitable compromise between national sovereignty and the collective international good; of trying to ensure the maximum security against the international spread of disease with minimum interference to travel and trade.",

In 2000\u201304, GOARN responded to 34 events in 26 countries, and has grown to a partnership of over 120 institutions and networks, including UN and intergovernmental organisations. The Network provided substantial support to affected countries during the outbreak of the severe acute respiratory syndrome and in response to avian influenza. It was clear that the IHR (1969) also needed to change to allow response to contemporary threats to international health. Efforts towards achieving this response began in 1995.6\n",

Importantly, WHO can now use a range of sources of health intelligence to raise an alarm and begin a process of verification with countries that have not voluntarily reported significant health events. Parties capitalised to the IHR are required to inform WHO within 24 h of the receipt of evidence of a public-health risk that might cause international spread of a disease. Finally, if WHO obtains credible evidence that a public-health event of international importance has occurred and fails to obtain disclosure and cooperation by the affected state, it has discretionary power to release the public-health information required to protect global public health.",

Furthermore, because most human emerging infectious diseases are zoonotic in origin, there is a need for close collaboration between the veterinary, human health, and wildlife sectors.8 The regulations of the Office International des Epizooties, the veterinary counterpart of the IHR, face similar challenges as did the IHR (1969), and perhaps need a similar overhaul. The problems currently faced in confronting the threat to human and animal health posed by the outbreaks of avian influenza A H5N1 in Asia amply illustrate this contention. The IHR (2005) will enter into force in 2007.",
