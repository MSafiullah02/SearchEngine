On the other hand, there is a growing demand by industry for plants used in traditional medicine that could be incorporated in foods, nutraceuticals, cosmetics, or even pharmaceuticals. Glycyrrhiza glabra Linn. belongs to the Fabaceae family and has been recognized since ancient times for its ethnopharmacological values. This plant contains different phytocompounds, such as glycyrrhizin, 18\u03b2-glycyrrhetinic acid, glabrin A and B, and isoflavones, that have demonstrated various pharmacological activities. Pharmacological experiments have demonstrated that different extracts and pure compounds from this species exhibit a broad range of biological properties, including antibacterial, anti-inflammatory, antiviral, antioxidant, and antidiabetic activities. A few toxicological studies have reported some concerns. This review addresses all those issues and focuses on the pharmacological activities reported for G. glabra.",

In particular, the root is used as a flavouring agent for American-type tobacco, chewing gum, candies, baked goods, ice cream, and soft drinks (Rizzato, Scalabrin, Radaelli, Capodaglio, & Piccolo, 2017) . In beers and fire extinguishers, the root extracts are used as foaming agents, whereas the root fibbers are used in insulation, wallboard, and boxboard materials, after removal of the medicinal and flavouring constituents. In the cosmetic field, G. glabra is described as a skin depigmentation agent and is being incorporated in topical products for that purpose.",

Since the Egyptian age, the therapeutic properties of G. glabra are well documented (Fiore et al., 2005) . The roots are the most used parts whereas leaves are considered an agrochemical waste. However, in the last years, different authors studied the phytochemical composition of G. glabra leaves, demonstrating that certain compounds present in the roots are also identified in leaves, although in smaller quantities (Hayashi & Sudo, 2009; Siracusa et al., 2011) .",

Nutritionally, liquorice is a source of proteins, amino acids, polysaccharides and simple sugars, mineral salts (such as calcium, phosphorus, sodium, potassium, iron, magnesium, silicon, selenium, manganese, zinc, and copper), pectins, resins, starches, sterols, and gums (Q. . Oestrogens, tannins, phytosterols (sitosterol and stigmasterol), coumarins, vitamins (B1, B2, B3, B5, E, and C), and glycosides have been reported (Q. Wang, Qian, et al., 2015) . A large number of biological compounds have also been isolated, mostly triterpenes, saponins (responsible for the sweet taste), and flavonoids (Rizzato et al., 2017; Q. Wang, Qian, et al., 2015) . The liquorice saponins are present as glucuronides, whereas the aglycones are present as oleananes. The triterpene saponins are the major characteristic constituents of liquorice, being responsible for the sweet taste. The contents of these compounds may vary significantly due to geographic sources, harvesting, and processing, affecting the therapeutic effects of liquorice.",

The phenolic content is probably responsible for the powerful antioxidant activity observed (Rackova et al., 2007) . Varsha and Sonam (2013) attributed this activity to flavonoids, whereas Singh et al. (2015) reported that mostly isoflavones, such as glabridin, hispaglabridin A, and 30-hydroxy-4-O-methylglabridin, are the responsible compounds. Biondi, Rocco, and Ruberto (2003) reported a huge antioxidant activity of the dihydrostilbene derivates present in G. glabra leaves. Also, licochalcones B and D are present in G. glabra, showing a strong scavenging activity on DPPH radical and the ability to inhibit the microsomal lipid peroxidation (Biondi et al., 2003; V. Sharma, Katiyar, & Agrawal, 2016) . These phenolic compounds are effective in the protection of biological systems against oxidative stress, being able to inhibit the onset of skin damages (Haraguchi et al., 1998) . According to Castangia et al. (2015) , the topical application of liquorice extract formulations may be of value in innovative dermal and cosmetic products as it counteracts oxidative stress damage, maintaining the skin homeostasis due to its high antioxidant content. Table 1 summarizes the most important studies of antioxidant activity.",

These pharmacological effects were due to an increase in the secretion of serotonin and prostaglandins in the stomach that led to a decrease of gastric inflammation (Bahmani et al., 2014) . Different authors described that the anti-inflammatory action is primary mediated by glycyrrhizin, which in vitro could inhibit factors responsible for inflammation as well as promote the healing of stomach and mouth ulcers (Rackova et al., 2007; Yin et al., 2017) . In fact, the anti-inflammatory effects of glycyrrhizin were described as similar to those of glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids (Kageyama, Suzuki, & Saruta, 1994) . Furthermore, G. glabra is used in renal and liver complications on the basis of its strong antiinflammatory effects (Y. Xiao et al., 2010) . Y. Xiao et al. (2010) reported the inhibition of liver granuloma formation and the inflammatory cytokine production by glycyrrhizin, whereas X. R. Wang, Hao, and Chu (2017) described the anti-inflammatory effects on endometriosis. Moreover, Liu et al. (2017) proved the anti-inflammatory activity of glabridin on RAW cells.",

            "text": "The use of G. glabra extract as antiulcerative is widely known. For the gastrointestinal system, it is used in gastric and duodenal ulcers (Bardhan, Cumberland, Dixon, & Holdsworth, 1978) , whereas for the treatment of spasmodic pains of chronic gastritis, it is employed as an adjuvant (Armanini et al., 2002) . The benefits of G. glabra in the treatment of duodenal and peptic ulcers have been reported since the 1970s, and this traditional use is related to the presence of antiinflammatory saponins (Krausse et al., 2004) . The major compound responsible for this activity is glycyrrhizin, which can raise the concentration of prostaglandins in the digestive tract, promoting stomach mucus secretion (Jafarian & Ghazvini, 2007) . In addition, liquorice prolongs the lifespan of stomach surface cells, demonstrating an antipepsin effect (Ram, Lachake, Kaushik, & Shreedhara, 2010) . Furthermore, deglycyrrhizinated liquorice has shown some effects in the treatment of gastrointestinal ulcers, suggesting the presence of other active ingredients (Zadeh, Kor, & Goftar, 2013) . Indeed, carbenoxolone, a glycyrrhetinic acid analogue, is reported to inhibit two important enzymes for the metabolism of prostaglandin, 15-hydroxyprostaglandin dehydrogenase and \u0394 13 prostaglandin reductase, raising prostaglandin levels and leading to positive effects in clinical trials for gastric and duodenal ulcers (Damle, 2014) . In fact, prostaglandins stimulate mucous secretion and cell proliferation leading to ulcer healing. Nevertheless, the glycyrrhetic acid derivative carbenoxolone presents secondary effects such as the potential development of pseudo aldosteronism, which limits its use. In a clinical trial, Bardhan et al. (1978) studied the effect of liquorice by oral administration in 96 patients with gastric ulcer. The patients were randomly allocated to the treatment either with deglycyrrhizinated liquorice or with placebo. However, after 4 weeks, no differences were observed between groups in the percentage of ulcer area reduction or clinical improvements (Bardhan et al., 1978) . particular, glabridin, glabrol, glabrene, hispaglabridin A, hispaglabridin B, 40-methylglabridin, and 3-hydroxyglabrol, isolated from G. glabra, are responsible for this activity (L. . The mechanism behind this could be the decrease of bacterial gene expression, the inhibition of bacterial growth, and the reduction of bacterial toxin production (Gupta et al., 2008; L. Wang, Yang, et al., 2015) . In 2014, S.-J. Ahn, Song, Mah, Cho, and Kook (2014) (Fukai et al., 2002a (Fukai et al., , 2002b L. Wang, Yang, et al., 2015) . On the other hand, the ability to inactivate methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) by decreasing the expression of SaeR and Hla, the key virulence genes of MRSA, have also been reported by different authors (Fukai et al., 2002a (Fukai et al., , 2002b L. Wang, Yang, et al., 2015) . It is also suggested that licochalcone E could be used for chemical synthesis of novel anti-S. aureus compounds, reducing the production of \u03b1-toxin in both methicillin-sensitive S. aureus and MRSA (L. .",

(2016) also reported that 18\u03b2-glycyrrhetinic acid significantly attenuated the gastritis infection caused by H. pylori. Asha et al. (2013) found that the flavonoid glabridin exhibits activity against H. pylori whereas glycyrrhizin did not present activity even at a concentration of 250 \u03bcg/ml. These flavonoids also showed activity against H. pylori strains resistant to clarithromycin and amoxicillin (Fukai et al., 2002a (Fukai et al., , 2002b . The probable mechanism behind these action is the inhibition of the protein synthesis, DNA gyrase, and dihydrofolate reductase (Fukai et al., 2002a (Fukai et al., , 2002b . Moreover, the liquorice polysaccharides also present activity against Porphyromonas gingivalis adhesion, which is of huge importance because no specific adhesion inhibitors have been described (Chinsembu, 2016) .",

Also, oxygen free radicals are implicated in the process of aging and could be responsible for the development of Alzheimer's disease in elderly persons. The protective role of liquorice extract may be attributed to its antioxidant properties, resulting in reduced brain damage and improvement of neuronal function and memory.

Recent studies have shown that liquorice extract produces significant antidepressant effects in mice during forced swim test (FST) and tail suspension test (TST; Dhingra & Sharma, 2006) . In the FST model, mice were forced to swim in a restricted space and induced to a characteristic behaviour of immobility. This situation reflects a state of depression. The TST model also induces a state of immobility that is claimed to reproduce a condition similar to human depression. Both models are widely used to screen antidepressant drugs. The precise mechanisms by which liquorice extract produced this effect are not completely understood. However, it is suggested that the extract may interact with \u03b11-adrenoceptors and dopamine D2 receptors, increasing the levels of norepinephrine and dopamine in the mice brain (Dhingra & Sharma, 2006) . Besides, p-CPA (a serotonin synthesis inhibitor) did not attenuate the antidepressant effect of liquorice extract, suggesting that this is not mediated by the serotonergic system. On the other hand, p-CPA reversed the antidepressant effect of fluoxetine, suggesting that fluoxetine acts in the serotonergic system. Reserpine produces a significant depression by depleting biogenic amines in the brain of rodents. As liquorice extract reversed reserpine-induced depression, its antidepressant effect can be associated with the restoration of brain monoamines, such as norepinephrine and dopamine.",

The oestrogenic effect of liquorice ethanolic extract could be explained by its agonist activity on MCF-7 breast cancer cells, being this action mediated by 18\u03b2-glycyrrhetinic acid (G. Sharma et al., 2012) . Glabridin is a common component of herbal remedies used for the treatment of menopausal symptoms, resulting in favourable outcomes similar to those of 17\u03b2oestradiol (Su Wei Poh et al., 2015) . In concentrations between 2.5 and 25 \u03bcg per animal, glabridin induces similar effects to the administration of oestradiol in a concentration of 5 \u03bcg per animal. Glabridin was found to be three to four times more active than 2\u2032-Omethylglabridin and 4\u2032-O-methylglabridin (Tamir et al., 2000) . Moreover, according to Tamir et al. (2001) , glabrene has a considerable oestrogenic activity. Glabridin and glabrene are similar to 17\u03b2oestradiol in the stimulation of the specific activity of creatine kinase, although at higher concentrations, differing in the extension rate of action as well as in the interaction with other drugs. In human premenopausal bone cells, the response to 17\u03b2-oestradiol and glabridin (at a higher concentration) was higher than in postmenopausal cells,",

Mitochondrial dysfunction, especially respiratory chain disruption, is responsible for aging-related bone diseases.

The exposure to high levels of glycyrrhizin can produce hypermineralocorticoid-like effects. Glycyrrhetic acid and liquorice saponins can inhibit 11-\u03b2-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase enzyme, leading to a cortisol-induced mineralocorticoid effect and a consequent tendency to the elevation of sodium and reduction of potassium levels (Isbrucker & Burdock, 2006) . For example, in 2010, a 34-yearold woman was suspected to have suffered a lethal acute intoxication from eating liquorice over a period of several months (Albermann et al., 2010) . Albermann et al. associated the effects with the potential mineralocorticoid action of glycyrrhizin and its metabolite, glycyrrhetic acid, and quantified by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry these compounds in the blood. Nevertheless, only traces of glycyrrhetic acid had been found in the blood and stomach content of the deceased woman, which means that the possibility of acute lethal glycyrrhetic acid intoxication could be eliminated (Albermann et al., 2010) .",

Nevertheless, Cinatl et al. (2003) reported that these active principles are less effective if added during the adsorption period than after virus adsorption. On the other hand, Soufy et al. (2012) found that glycyrrhizin has excellent immunostimulant properties and induces a synergistic effect with duck hepatitis virus (DHV) vaccine by activating T lymphocyte proliferation. Thus, the treatment with glycyrrhizin alone or in combination with DHV vaccine could lead to an immune stimulation and antiviral effect against DHV (Soufy et al., 2012).",

Also, the activity against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was evaluated(Sasaki et al., 2002). Glycyrrhizin has been used to treat patients with HIV-1 (L.. The results revealed a low concentration of P24 antigen in patients, probably due to the up-regulation of chemokines(Sabde et al., 2011).Intravenous glycyrrhizin has been employed for more than 20 years in Japan for the treatment of chronic hepatitis(van Rossum et al., 1999). Glycyrrhizin, when compared with the placebo, presents clinical interest for the possible treatment of chronic hepatitis C, inducing a significant reduction of the serum aminotransferases and an improvement in the liver histology(Ploeger et al., 2001). Also, it prevents the development of hepatocellular carcinoma in chronic hepatitis C(van Rossum, Vulto, de Man, Brouwer, & Schalm, 1998). Intravenous glycyrrhizin can be also used for the treatment of acute-onset autoimmune hepatitis(Yasui et al., 2011). Another study shows that glycyrrhizin interferes with highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza A virus replication(Michaelis et al., 2011).Glycyrrhizin can also be used as a novel therapeutic method to control porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus (PEDV) infection, inhibiting the infection of Vero cells (namely, the entry and replication of PEDV) and decreasing the mRNA levels of proinflammatory cytokines(Huan et al., 2017).",

(2008) demonstrated the toxic effect of G. glabra against the human cervix and uterus tumour cell line SiHa cells.Ohtsuki et al. (1992) reported the in vivo inhibition of Ehrlich ascites tumour cell growth by the aqueous and methanolic extracts of G. glabra, with the corresponding reduction in cell number, body weight, and ascites volume. The hydromethanolic root extract of G. glabra also exhibited antimutagenic potential by suppressing micronuclei formation and chromosomal aberration in bone marrow cells of albino mice (V.Sharma, Agrawal, & Shrivastava, 2014). Glycyrrhizin and glycyrrhetinic acids are effective compounds in gastric cancer treatment, whereas glycyrrhizin suppresses thromboxane A2 in lung cancer cell with low toxicity(Deng, Wang, Zeng, Chen, & Huang, 2017). According to S., 18\u03b2glycyrrhetinic acid has antitumour activities in breast and ovarian cancer, gastric tumours, and leukaemia. In liver cancer, the compound inhibits the proliferation of HepG2 cells without affecting the normal liver cell line. In particular, 18\u03b2-glycyrrhetinic acid increases the formation of reactive oxygen species, nitric oxide production, and loss of the mitochondrial membrane potential(Hasan et al., 2016).Glycyrrhetinic acid derivatives have also presented promising cytotoxicity on human breast cancer cell lines(MCF-7, MDA-MB-  231;Li, Feng, Song, Li, & Huai, 2016).

Studies on rodents and humans demonstrated that glycyrrhizin is poorly absorbed by the gastrointestinal tract but extensively metabolized by the intestinal microflora to glycyrrhetic acid and monoglucuronyl glycyrrhetic acid, which are both readily absorbed. Thus, an enterohepatic circulation of glycyrrhetic acid can occur, requiring several days for complete body elimination (Koga, Kawamura, Iwase, & Yoshikawa, 2013). Also, during premenstrual syndrome, the use of this plant may cause water retention and bloating. 6 | CONCLUDING REMARKS This review has presented a comprehensive view about the phytochemistry composition and pharmacology activities of G. glabra. This plant has been broadly used as a traditional medicine and food industry ingredient, particularly as a flavour and sweetening agent. The roots are used in the prevention and treatment of several complications, especially microbial/viral infection, cancer, and skin inflammation. Among the bioactive compounds, flavonoids are the most important, being responsible for most of the biological activities. Different phytochemicals, including glycyrrhizin, 18\u03b2-glycyrrhetinic acid, glabrin A and B, or isoflavones, have been identified and associated with the biological activities reported, namely, antioxidant, antiviral, antimicrobial, anticancer, or anti-inflammatory activities as well as hepatoprotection. These activities generally agree with traditional knowledge and folk medicine. Indeed, the side effects and toxicity associated with liquorice are few and are mainly linked with hypertension and fluid retention. Regarding this particular thematic, to date, few studies have been conducted, aside from some isolated ones.",
