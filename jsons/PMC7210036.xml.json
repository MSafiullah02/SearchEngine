The approval of thalidomide in 2006 to treat multiple myeloma is yet another example.10 Drug repurposing could also be a useful approach during outbreaks of emerging diseases such as the recent attempts to use the FDA-approved human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 aspartate protease inhibitor, lopinavir,13 or the combination of the anti-malaria agent hydroxychloroquine with the macrolide antibiotic azithromycin to overcome the current pandemic of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19).14",

Disulfiram blocks the alcohol metabolism at the acetaldehyde stage, leading to the accumulation of the latter in the blood. This in turn produces a highly unpleasant reaction, which includes low blood pressure, tachycardia, facial flushing, vomiting and vertigo when the patient treated with disulfiram ingests even small amounts of alcohol.15 In 1951, disulfiram was the first drug to be approved by the FDA to treat chronic alcoholism. Many studies since then have shown the potential of repurposing disulfiram as an anticancer agent.16 Currently, disulfiram is progressing through different stages of clinical trials to treat diverse types of malignant tumors, such as metastatic breast cancer, glioblastoma and recurrent pancreatic carcinoma. Disulfiram has also shown therapeutic potential as a latency-reversing agent in treating AIDS patients.17,18 More recently, disulfiram was shown to be beneficial in treating Lyme disease and babesiosis.19",

Disulfiram is considered a safe, well tolerated drug.32 A single oral dose of 6 g or daily doses of up to 0.75 g administered for months are generally tolerated by human adults without symptoms.33,34 Disulfiram is also characterized by a high oral LD50 dose of up to 8.6 g/kg in rats.35 Indeed, disulfiram is a potent inhibitor of both isoforms of aldehyde dehydrogenase Ald1a1 and Aldh2. But since Aldh1a1 has bigger substrate entrance tunnel than Aldh2, disulfiram, a rather large hydrophobic compound, has a higher affinity to Aldh1a1.20 In this work, we investigated the potential use of disulfiram as a treatment for obesity.",

HFD-fed rats treated at higher doses of DSF, 200 mg/kg/day, showed a strong resistance to body weight increase.
