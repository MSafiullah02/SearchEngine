By March 9,  the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released special guidance for Santa Clara County, California recommending cessation of elective surgical practices (3) . The Santa Clara County Public Health Department issued a shelter-in-place order on March 16, 2020 to improve social distancing and decrease the potential for spread of COVID-19 (4) . This unprecedented preemptive public health intervention was one of the first such orders in the US, and was followed by a statewide shelter-in-place order on March 19, 2020 (5) . At this time in our institution we had between 5-10 hospitalized patients infected with COVID-19. In anticipation of the predicted surge of patients infected with COVID-19 and the need to rationally utilize personal protective equipment (PPE) while continuing to provide urgent and emergency surgical interventions, we developed institutional guidelines for precautions for operating room team members during the COVID-19 pandemic. While the preponderance of evidence suggests that COVID-19 is droplet spread, some literature supports spread by aerosol (6, 7). In conjunction with our infection disease experts, we develop our guidelines based upon potential patterns of spread, risk of exposure and conservation of PPE.",

Patients were initially triaged by acuity into urgent and emergency procedures. No guidance was provided for elective procedures as these had been stopped in accordance with county order (4) . Rapid testing for COVID-19 virus was not possible for emergency procedures. We assumed all patients undergoing emergency procedures to be infected by COVID-19 until proven otherwise.

COVID-19 virus RNA had been documented in the gastrointestinal tract (16) . Given the potential for aerosolizing intraluminal contents during endoscopy, this was considered a high-risk AGP.

We decided to make RT-PCR testing of symptomatic patients mandatory given the availability of in-house testing at our institution, with the caveat of a 24-hour turn around.
