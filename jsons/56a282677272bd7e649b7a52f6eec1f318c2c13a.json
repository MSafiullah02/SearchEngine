There are many amplification free[7] and amplification based [8] methods 64 for nucleic acid detection. In traditional molecular testing labs, the experimenters need to move the 65 liquid from one tube to another. The sensitivity of nucleic acid detection can increase after 66 amplification. However, pipetting based nucleic acid assays have two disadvantages. One is that 67 complex operating steps cannot meet the requirements of POCT[9] . Another is that target 68 formed aerosol after amplification may contaminate the environment [10] , especially some 69 highly infectious viruses which may make put technicians at in danger. Quantitative presence of electromagnet will contribute to the automation of integrated nucleic acid 102 detection platform. When using the electromagnet, the magnetic field can be controlled by 7 power-on and power-off. The strength of the magnetic field can be controlled by the intensity 104 of current. In this way, we can control the speed of magnetic particles when passing through 105 different reaction tanks by controlling the current intensity. Also, it will be convenient to (Fig. 3 A) . In addition to avoiding the bulky equipment and lowering the assay costs, ",

Although the amplification and detection steps of qPCR are combined in one closed 72 tube, making nucleic acid detection convenient and time-saving[11], the extraction and 73 purification steps are not integrated.74To avoid the problems mentioned above, an integrated, closed, simplified and automated75 analysis system for POCT is urgently needed. Recently, microfluidic technology was well 76 developed. It has been widely used in life science, environmental science and diagnosis.77 Integrated microfluidic chips are gradually moving from laboratory research to commercial 78 application[12]. Microfluidics technology replicates testing functions of traditional 79 6 biochemical laboratory on a chip but it is difficult to move small amounts of liquid in tight 80 spaces. To solve it, most of microfluidic chips with narrow aisles require pumps, valves or 81 centrifuges to control the liquid transfer, which limits its their application and promotion in 82 portable POCT. Some capillary flow assay based or paper based chips can avoid using 83 external equipment to pipette when preventing and monitoring public health outbreaks[13, 14]. 84 However, if the analysis channel is long or the liquid composition is complicated, the 85 detection sensitivity will be significantly affected by the liquid evaporation. In summary, an 86 integrated nucleic acid purification, amplification and detection system without pipetting of nucleic acid detection is moving towards automation, efficiency and 89 point-of-care detection. Magnetic particles are good tools for nucleic acid purification. Many 90 magnetic bead extraction kits have become commercial products[15]. They can move under 91 the magnetic field, avoiding removing the lid and pipetting, which contributes to the 92 integration, portability and rapidity of nucleic acid assays[16]. There are several advantages 93 of magnetic particles assisted nucleic acid assays. Firstly, it is a safe and environmentally 94 friendly nucleic acid extraction method compared with some chemical methods[17]. Secondly, 95 researchers can choose different types and sizes of magnetic particles according to their 96 samples, which is beneficial to improve extraction efficiency and reduce costs[18]. Finally, 97 the magnetic particles can be driven under the magnetic fields with no limitation of liquid 98 volume. It is promising for the integrated nucleic acid purification, amplification and 99 detection[19, 20].

            "text": "The types of magnetic particles for nucleic acid purification 173 The target extraction process before nucleic acid detection affects the sensitivity and 174 reliability of the entire experiment. As a bridge, magnetic particles are connected to coated magnetic particles are popular in various biochemical analysis. Nucleic 180 acids can be bound to the surface of silica coated magnetic particles in a high concentration of 181 salt and low pH solution while the targets can be eluted again at a low concentration of salt 182 and high pH solution. The binding mechanism is most likely to be the electrostatic 183 interactions between nucleic acids with silica. When the solution is at low pH and high salt 184 concentration, the negatively charged phosphate backbone of nucleic acids bind to the 185 positively charged surface of particles[44]. It was reported that silica coated magnetic 186 particles could extract HBV and HCV nucleic acids from serum in 30 min.1 g of prepared 187 silica coated magnetic particles can adsorb up to 10.6 mg DNA or 7.7 mg RNA with 4 M 188 guanidinium thiocyanate (GTC) at pH 5.5[45]. Based on silica coated magnetic particles, total 189 nucleic acids of RNA virus/viroid can be extracted from lily-leaf or grapevine-leaf samples 190 for qPCR detection[46]. For many biological samples, both DNA and RNA need to be 191 extracted for analysis. Silica coated magnetic particles were demonstrated to simultaneously 192 extract DNA and RNA from Hepatocellular Carcinoma, which is convenient and low cost for 193 medical diagnosis[47].194 The positively charged magnetic particles are ideal for the attachment of phosphate backbone 195 of nucleic acids. The amino group coated particles are preferred. Within the particular 196 concentration of salt in solution, the negatively charged phosphate groups of nucleic acids 197 have interactions with positive charges on the surface of magnetic composite particles. The 198 nucleic acids can be separated from solution and eluted from magnetic particles[48]. The 199 11 DNA extracted from whole blood by amino coated particles were well performed in PCR. The 200 concentration of extracted DNA increased with the identity of amino groups[49]. It was 201 reported that the behaviors of DNA adsorption/desorption on amino coated magnetic particles 202 could be influenced by phosphate. When the concentration of phosphate buffer is 1 M, the 203 recovery of efficient DNA desorption is 85%, which provides a good guidance for the 204 subsequent enzymatic experiments[50]. 205 The negatively carboxyl coated magnetic nanoparticles can also extract nucleic acids. In high 206 concentrations of polyethylene glycol (PEG) and sodium chloride solutions, nucleic acids can 207 bind to the surface of carboxyl coated magnetic particles, the mechanism of which is complex. 208 In general, in solution containing low concentrations of salt and PEG, DNA are at 209 random-coil state. The increasing concentration of PEG and sodium chloride promotes the 210 condensation and compaction of DNA. The negative charge on the condensed part of DNA is 211 almost neutralized in PEG solution with a small part of negative charge remaining on the 212 uncondensed part of DNA, eliminating electrostatic repulsion between nucleic acids and 213 magnetic particles and promoting the DNA adsorption on the surface of magnetic 214 particles[51]. The carboxyl coated magnetic particle method is expeditious for extracting of 215 PCR-ready DNA from staphylococcus aureus bacteriophages without using toxic 216 compounds[52]. Apart from isolation mRNA from mammalian cells, carboxyl coated 217 magnetic particles can also be used to extract the supercoiled form of plasmid DNA from 218 agarose gel. The method is simple and inexpensive with high quality of extraction[53]. 219 The extraction methods mentioned above are based on the chemical properties of nucleic 220 acids. They can be used to extract total nucleic acids rather than specific nucleic acids, for 221 example, isolation of RNA from unwanted cellular components DNA and proteins. Sequence 222 specific oligonucleotides immobilized on the magnetic particles can extract specific nucleic 12 acid fragments by Watson-Crick pairing. To evaluate the function of silica coated, oligo 224 coated and specific oligonucleotide sequence coated magnetic particles, these particles are 225 incubated in the samples to target RNA for 1 min, the recovery of which are 75%, 71%, 7% 226 respectively. When the incubation time increases to 180 min, the recovery of specific 227 oligonucleotide sequence coated magnetic particles can recover 77% targets. It is expected 228 that silica coated, oligo coated and specific oligonucleotide sequence coated magnetic 229 particles extract total RNA, mRNA and specific gene mRNA respectively. It will be a good 230 guidance for the next detection step of different tolerance of non-target nucleic acids[18]. 231 Furthermore, ion-tagged oligonucleotides coupled with a magnetic liquid support can not only 232 distinguishing nucleotide mismatches, they can also extract target DNA with higher 233 sensitivity than commercial magnetic kits[54]. Magnetite particle conjugated with 234 pyrrolidinyl peptide nucleic acid might also be a potential support for base discrimination[55]. 235 236 3. The open type of magnetic nucleic acid assays 237 Traditional nucleic acid extraction in laboratory relies on centrifuge tubes with an adsorption 238 film, which requires lots of organic reagents and multiple centrifugation steps. This process is 239 difficult to automate and the organic reagents are toxic to the operators. For large-volume 240 samples, multiple batches of extraction are required. The traditional extraction method cannot 241 meet the requirements of POCT with high speed, simple steps and high capture efficiency. To 242 the contrary, the magnetic separation process is simple without centrifugation and 243 precipitation steps. Commercial magnetic extraction kits and automated instruments greatly 244 reduce the burden of manual operation[56]. However, as illustrated in the Fig. 2, these are 245 open type nucleic acid extraction assays, requiring magnetic particles transfer[57] or liquid 246 transfer[25] from one tube to another. When performing pathogens experiments in an open 247 system, it is difficult to avoid contamination of amplification products and infection . To avoid cross-contamination, air flow systems supporting pipetting 252 systems always keep running in order to take taking away aerosols. The bulky equipment with 253 high prize is suitable for specialized laboratories and high-level hospitals rather than remote 254 areas lacking of resources. To apply it to on-site detection, disposable cartridges with manual 255 pipetting are studied. In the disposable cartridge, operators need to manually move the 256 pipettor up and down, left and right. The whole operation process is very complicated. Also, it 257 is difficult to transport the cartridges because of the stored liquid reagents in tubes[58]. 258 Compared with pipetting based methods, non-pipetting methods will be easier to automate. 259 Integrated nucleic acid purification is the basis of integrated nucleic acid detection. To 260 achieve integrated nucleic acid detection, the integrated nucleic acid purification is necessary. 261 In order to improve the universality and applicability of nucleic acid detection, there is an 262 urgent need for a closed system integrating target extraction, signal amplification and final 263 detection without pipetting. This will be helpful for the controlling the outbreaks of infectious 264 diseases and greatly reducing the casualties of the epidemic. 265 266 4. The closed type of magnetic nucleic acid assays 267 4.1 The immiscible interface based nucleic acid purification 268 Traditional nucleic acid detection processes are performed in the open tubes. It is 269 time-consuming and difficult to prevent cross-contamination. With the increasing demand for 270 point-of-care nucleic acid detection, a series of technologies have been developed towards the 271 integrated systems. Some companies have developed commercial chips or cassettes 272 integrating nucleic acid purification, amplification and detection. However, these chips or 273 14 cassettes are equipped with dedicated instruments, which is complicated and expensive. The 274 magnetic particles can pass through the immiscible interface introduced above without 275 pipetting. It is a good carrier for nucleic acid integrated detection. The immiscible interface 276 can also provide a closed system for the transport of magnetic particles from one chamber to 277 another and prevent aerosol contamination. In integrated system, purified nucleic acids should 278 be prepared for amplification and detection. The purification process is important for the next 279 detection. Thus, the integrated purification process that avoids multiple elution and 280 centrifugations will be introduced initially. 281 Magnetic particles assisted extraction is a solid phase extraction method actuated by magnetic 282 fields. Magnetic particles can 'swim' in a single passage through immiscible phase replacing 283 multiple pipetting steps. The phase guide solid extraction passage includes water/oil interfaces 284 and water/air interfaces. 285 The water-oil interface based nucleic acid purification device 286 In 2010, Sur et al. reported a molded cartridge equipped with containing two wells containing 287 lysis/binding buffer and elution buffer respectively. The two wells are covered with a layer of 288 liquid wax, which can connect the two channels and prevent the liquid from mixing. The 289 clinical samples are added to the well of the lysis buffer and then nucleic acids are released 290 from the cells.

As illustrated in Fig. 4, to deal with large volume samples, the size of input well is 325 adjusted and the nucleic acids of Helicobacter pylori from stool samples are extracted, 326 requiring required only 7 min[65]. However, the magnetic particles have to pass through the 327 wells along the bottom of the horizontal device. Magnetic beads may carry some impurities 328 deposited on the bottom when passing through different wells. Thus, a vertical device is 329 designed. The magnetic particles pass through the middle part of the wells rather than the 330 bottom, avoiding the risk of carrying unwanted components[66]. 331 Furthermore, to better evaluate the results, sometimes to purify both RNA and DNA 332 simultaneously is needed. The traditional techniques are cesium chloride step-gradient 333 ultracentrifugation or the phase separation guanidinium thiocyanate-phenol-chloroform 334 procedures, which requires complex operation and toxic reagents. Based on vertical IFAST 335 device, Strotman et al. addressed this problem and developed an efficient method to purify 336 RNA and DNA from a single sample[67]. Difference from the previous device, they present a 337 vertical symmetrical structured. The improved IFAST (Fig. 5) has two output wells that are 338 symmetrical but not interoperable. 339 Firstly, add the samples, lysis buffer/RNA binding buffer and oligonucleotide modified 340 magnetic particles to bind RNA in the input well. Then pull the magnet in the front of the 341 IFAST device and release RNA from magnetic particles in the front output well. Having 342 extracted RNA, add the DNA binding buffer and silicon modified magnetic particles in the 343 input well to bind DNA. Then pull the magnet in the back of the device and release DNA in 344 the output well on the back. Firstly, add the samples, RNA lysis buffer and magnetic particles 345 17 used to bind RNA in the input well. Then pull the magnet in the front of the IFAST device and 346 release RNA in the front output well. Finally, add the DNA lysis buffer and magnetic particles 347 used to bind DNA and pull the magnet in the back of the device and release DNA in the 348 output well on the back. The RNA and DNA extracted from a low abundance of cells are 349 demonstrated to be used as templates for Sanger sequencing. It is a fast, sensitive and 350 low-cost improved device to extract DNA and RNA simultaneously.",

The magnetic nucleic 353 acid extraction step can enrich targets and remove most inhibitors. However, in the process of 354 travelling through water-oil immiscible phase, the magnetic particles will inevitably carry a 355 small volume of aqueous liquid which may contain inhibitors of enzymatic reaction. It is 356 reported that the volume of carriers increases with the surface tension of the immiscible 357 interface until it reaches a critical value surface tension. When the surface tension rises to a 358 critical value, the volume of carriers remains constant, which will provide a guidance for the 359 size of magnetic particles and the value of surface tension[69]. If the oil was not involved, the 360 magnetic particles assisted solid phase extraction process would be simpler. It was reported 361 that the air gaps could replace the oil interface as the separator between different solutions.362The water-air interface based nucleic acid purification device363The water/oil interface can prevent the reaction solution from mixing.

The prototype extraction cassette is 367 composed of glass capillary chambers (each chamber 80 mm length; 2 mm inter diameter) 368 and pipet tips (1000 \u00b5L) acted as spacers between each capillary chamber. The capillary 369 18 chamber is used to place the samples to be detected and the other capillary solution chamber is separated by the 2 mm air gap. The silica coated magnetic 373 particles can connect the entire extraction process as a whole and finish the whole process in 374 15 min. However, the extraction recovery of RNA remains to be improved. Another 375 disadvantage is that the extraction tube is a little long which is inconvenient in practical 376 application. The surface tension assisted by water/air interface provides a new idea and 377 extends the way for magnetic nucleic acid assays. 378 Here, we give an example to illustrate the effectiveness of water-air interface based extraction 379 method. The whole nucleic acid extraction processes are completed in a small diameter tubing 380 'extraction cassette' in which solutions are separated by air gaps. The bulb of a transfer 381 pipette containing magnetic particles and lyophilized adsorption buffer are used to take 382 human urine sample. Having mixed thoroughly, depressing the bulb of the pipette to transfer 383 the liquids into the thin tube in which all wash and elution steps are finished. In the results, 50% 384 of spiked DNA was recovered by qPCR evaluation while no DNA could be detected in spiked 385 samples without extraction[71]. The reason is that the magnetic extraction assays removed the 386 PCR inhibitors in the samples. For practical application, the sample collection and extraction 387 processes are simple. However, the recovery of target nucleic acids is low, which affects the 388 sensitivity of downstream detection.389It is obvious that the adjacent solutions separated by immiscible interfaces will mix if the 390 diameter of the continuous tube is too large. Thus, the physical parameters of the tube and the 391 magnetic particles are significant for the stability transport, solution carryover and extraction 392 efficiency. It was found that fluid stability is maximized if the inter diameter of the tube low-resource magnetic assays will be useful for other researchers. To better 397 apply water-air valve, the magneto-capillary valve technologies that magnetic particles travel 398 through discrete liquids separated by water-air immiscible phase are summarized and 399 compared, including the patterned air valve, the geometrical air valve and the paraffin valve.",

In 411 water-air passage, magnetic particles have a large specific surface area but are easily 412 deposited in the liquids due to the gravity. To improve the mixing and capture efficiency of 413 targets from the liquids in water-air passage, the two-magnet strategy is applied. Compared 414 with the single-magnet strategy, the capture time of two-magnet is three times faster and the 415 capture efficiency is 2.5 fold higher[74]. Also, the coaxial channel that can be applied to the 416 multiring high-gradient magnetic field is designed. The coaxial channel is composed of stirring and mixing in closed type of magnetic nucleic acid assays. According to 421 the different type of closed devices designed for nucleic acid assays, different strengths of 422 electromagnetic force can be applied. The electromagnetic force generating device will be a 423 very useful tool in the integrated nucleic acid assays. Through these methods, the efficiency 424 of water-air interface assisted nucleic acid extraction will greatly increase.425In addition to transferring magnetic particles in capillaries by water-air interfaces, lots of 426 research have been done to realize integrated nucleic acid detection by water-air interfaces 427 without capillaries. The water-air interface assisted magnetic nucleic acid assay is simple and428 cheap. In medical institutions and public health agencies, large number of samples need to be 429 processed in the short term. It is also good to realize simultaneous extraction of multiple 430 arrays and samples simultaneously. The magnetic particles bound to targets can 'jump' 431 through the air-liquid interface when magnetic force is greater than the surface tension force 432 (Fig. 6 B). The microarray experiment can be performed simultaneously by the magnetic 433 \"air-jump\" with high target yield, excellent reproducibility and shorten time[76]. It effectively 434 avoids the blocking problem of magnetic particles when passing through the slender tube.435 Similarly, to conveniently and efficiently extract nucleic acids, magnetic particles and droplet 436 array based parallel extraction methods are explored. The array of surface-adhering droplets 437 was used for the transportation of magnetic particles through buffer solutions. Suspended 438 magnetic particles beads are placed above the droplet array to mix the liquid[77] (Fig. 6 C). 439 When using the sliding lid for droplet extractions with two magnets, the collection, release 440 and resuspension of magnetic particles can pass through multi-wash and elution integrated magnetic nucleic acid detection assays 446 Magnetic technology for nucleic acid extraction is well developed. The integrated methods of 447 nucleic acid purification for the downstream analysis are were reviewed. The immiscible 448 interface assisted devices have many versatile functions. It plays an important role in RNA or 449 DNA extraction, protein expression analysis, circulating tumor cells capture and 450 quantification[79]. It is a powerful tool supporting and promoting integrated assays. The 451 Group B Streptococcus from artificial urine samples can be rapidly detected based on it. The 452 target pathogens are adsorbed by immune-magnetic particles and detected using an adenosine 453 triphosphate (ATP) bioluminescence assay[80]. From the examples given above, we know 454 that there are many magnetic particles based integrated systems. A lot of studies are exploring 455 the integration of nucleic acid extraction and promoting the improvement of this technology. 456 Some designed magnetic integrated devices can be used in immunoassay or cell staining. 457 Currently, the key point is how to realize the integrated magnetic particles based detection in a 458 designed device that is closed, cheap and transportable. Compared with integrated 459 immunoassays, the magnetic particles assisted integrated system for nucleic acid extraction, 460 amplification and detection without pipetting is a little difficult. There are several reasons. 461 Firstly, it is difficult to link extraction and amplification step because there is no way to 462 transfer nucleic acids eluted from magnetic particles into amplification solution. Secondly, 463 enzymes required for nucleic acid amplification are generally stored at low temperatures. The 464 storage of the reagents placed in advance and the temperature control of enzymatic reactions 465 remains to be solved. The final problems are the testing instruments and the transport for DNA isolation and digital PCR detection. The integrated chip is divided 470 into DNA purification zone and digital PCR zone. In DNA purification zone, the magnetic 471 particles in the sample lysate are captured and keep still by the magnet. The tube that 472 connected with lysis zone is pre-loaded wash buffer and PCR mix. The pre-loaded wash 473 buffer can flow into the chamber and exclude contaminations by negative pressure from the 474 injection syringe. Then the nucleic acids can be eluted by PCR mix and pulled into digital 475 PCR region[81]. In this study, the role of magnetic particles is to capture and restrict target 476 DNA in the certain chamber when the wash buffer flowing through. The negative pressure 477 provided by the injection syringe play the main role in integrating the nucleic acid purification 478 with amplification. The nucleic acid extraction reagents are not compatible so two steps and 479 outlets are applied to pull the reagents. The PCR mix is comprised of RNase-free water and 480 necessary enzymatic reaction reagents so the elution effect may not be as good as the 481 commercial dedicated elution buffer. 482 The digital PCR mentioned above is mainly completed by the negative pressure generated by 483 the syringe and assisted by magnetic extraction. It has been reported that water-liquid 484 immiscible interface can assist magnetic particles to extract nucleic acids. Based on it, Yin et 485 al. proposed droplet digital PCR integrating with a fully closed extraction system[82]. In the 486 polytetrafluoroethylene tube (an inner diameter of 1 mm) which has the lowest surface 487 tension and does not adhere of to any substances, 10 \u00b5L mineral oil are used to separate lysis 488 buffer, wash buffer and elution buffer. The small volume of sample is injected into the tiny 489 tube and mixed with magnetic particles. As you can see in the (Fig. 7), having completed the 490 23 extraction process, the eluent is directly pulled into digital PCR chip by an automatic pump. 491 The above two methods all integrated nucleic acid extraction with digital PCR. They both use 492 negative pressure to drive liquid transfer and connect the extraction and amplification 493 processes. However, the former uses a syringe for pipetting in the whole process and can 494 handle larger sample volumes. while The latter can just handle micro-volume samples and the 495 automatic pump is only used in the interface for extraction and amplification. Depending on 496 the type of samples, the appropriate method can be chosen. 497 In a thin channel, magnetic particles may block the channel and make the movement a little 498 difficult. Under the premise of ensuring phase guide filtration, a relatively large space will 499 facilitate the movement of the magnetic particles. If there is no oil or air gaps, the integrated 500 operation might be difficult to propel[83]. The integrated chip is described which combines 501 nucleic acid extraction, digital recombinase polymerase amplification (dRPA) and 502 fluorescence detection. As illustrated in Fig. 8, there are four chambers in the integrated chip. 503 The centered one is filled with mineral oil and is connected with other three uniformly 504 distributed reagent chambers. The nucleic acids absorbed on the magnetic particles shuttle 505 between the chambers driven by the magnet field. The screw valves can separate solution in 506 different regions and prevent mixing. Having done extracted the nucleic acids extraction in 507 almost 10 min, the extracted nucleic acid and mineral oil can be driven into the micro-wells 508 ready for the digital RPA when opening the screw valves[84]. This 'sample in and answer out' 509 chip provide a simple way, screw microvalve, to control the isolation and integration of 510 extraction and amplification. They effectively used the mineral oil in only one chamber to 511 separate other reaction chambers, which is promising for the POCT in the future.",

Magnetic particles are good carriers for 530 nucleic acid adsorption and transferring driven by magnetic fields.

One method is based on pipetting, which transfers the 549 eluent to the amplification region by negative pressure or withdrawal of physical obstruction;550 The second method is to integrate the amplification solution with elution buffer, which 551 directly transfers the magnetic particles adsorbing nucleic acids from wash buffer to the 552 amplification solution. Both of the two points deserve further study. For point of care 553 detection, it is better to minimize the operating steps. The reagents required for nucleic acid 554 detection should be pre-loaded on the chips. The storage of the reagents needs to be 555 considered. Lyophilization and chitosan encapsulation are now commonly used to store 556 reagents. It has been shown that the performance of the reagents stored for several days 557 behaves well is still good. With the development of cold chain transportation, we believe that 558 storage will not be the main problem hindering the development of POCT. Furthermore, 559 immiscible phase assisted integrated purification and detection devices need to ensure that the 560 solution separated by oil or air gaps should not be mixed when experiencing a certain 561 intensity of shock during transportation.562Nucleic acid enzymatic reactions have high requirements for temperature control. .

The advantages and major challenges of magnetic particles for integrated 122 nucleic acid purification, amplification and detection without pipetting it will be presented. We do hope our review can provide an overview for future researchers and inspire more The synthesis and characterization of magnetic particles The magnetic particles with sizes of small size scale in diameter have some magnetic properties 129 different from conventional materials. The superparamagnetic particles do not have magnetic 130 interactions or aggregations without external magnetic field, so they can be well dispersed in 131 solution and sufficiently adsorb the targets[28]. Magnetic particles can be divided into three 132 categories: metal oxides, pure metals and magnetic alloys. Co, Fe and Ni based magnetic 133 particles are commonly used the most popular in biomedical applications. Among these 134 magnetic particles, magnetite Fe 3 O 4 and maghemite \u03b3-Fe 2 O 3 are the most popular in nucleic acid 135 assays because of their good biocompatibility, stability and fast separation under the external 136 magnetic fields[29]. Physical, chemical, and microbiological methods are the main methods for synthesizing 138 magnetic particles. Methods are summarized in Fig. 1. Among the above three methods, 139 chemical synthesis methods are the commonly used while physical methods are less used[30]. Physical synthesis methods, including gas-phase deposition[31] and electron beam 141 lithography[32], do not require chemical reagents or complex manual operation. However, it 142 is difficult to control the particle size of the synthesized particles, which is hard to meet the 143 requirements of bioanalysis. Microbiological synthesis of magnetic particles is a green 144 chemistry approach with low energy and high recovery rate. It was reported that various of 145 magnetic particles can be synthesized by bacteria, fungi, yeast and virus[33]. Although some 146 efforts have been made to optimize the microbial cultivation methods and the extraction 147 techniques, the incubation of microorganisms and production of magnetic particles takes too 148 much time[34]. Chemical methods are the most commonly used, such as oxidation method[35], with controllable form and size. In order to improve the efficiency of synthesis, the chemical 152 reactions should be performed under high temperature and high pressure[41], which 153 consumes lots of energy. It is notable that the residuals of stabilizer or metal oxide during the 154 preparation process may influence subsequent biological experiments. Therefore, the 155 separation, washing and drying steps after the reaction are also important.",
