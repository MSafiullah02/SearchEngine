There are many expert opinions and practical guidelines in the literature regarding the perioperative management of COVID-19 patients.2\u20134 However, the implementation of these guidelines will require local adaptation to be effective.5 For example, our institution\u2019s operating room (OR) complex does not have a negative pressure OR to contain aerosol contamination, which necessitates new workflows and processes to minimize movement through OR doors. To assess the effectiveness of these adaptations and uncover latent hazards, we designed and implemented high-fidelity insitu simulations (ISS) to replicate the scenarios of COVID-19 patients needing surgery. We present the findings from our ISS experience.",

The observers were resource personnel from each of the above-mentioned professions who had developed OR workflows and from other surgical disciplines not involved in the simulation. The participants and observers engaged in tabletop exercises before each ISS to discuss the workflow and processes. Debriefing was conducted at the end of each ISS. It focused on the critical review of 7 chronological key phases: notification of surgery, organization of OR preparation, donning of personal protection equipment (PPE), transport of the patient to OR, conduct of anesthesia and surgery, postsurgery doffing of OR team, and transport of patient out of OR. Each debriefing led to further improvements in the workflow and processes, which were tested in the subsequent simulation. A summary of the observations, improvements, and results in the 7 key phases is shownin theTable.",

The ISS should encompass the workflow in entirety: from notification of the OR of planned surgery in a COVID-19 patient to the safe transfer of the patient out of the OR complex after surgery. In our experience, the participants and observers became more familiar with the infection control measures through the ISS. Pre- and post-ISS surveys also indicated increase in scores for confidence in roles. The debriefings highlighted gaps in the processes and generated solutions that could be tested in subsequent ISS for suitability. Through our ISS, we developed cognitive aids and checklists, improved our workflows, defined various roles and responsibilities, and reconfigured the donning and doffing spaces and protocols. These interventions increased the capability and confidence of our OR team to care for a COVID-19 patient presenting for surgery.",

Given time and resource constraints in a pandemic, our methodology does not provide enough evidence to show that the improvements made through ISS will reduce COVID-19 infections among health care workers or improve COVID-19 patient outcomes in the OR. Nonetheless, ISS was a useful tool in enhancing our OR preparedness to manage surgical patients with a highly infectious disease.",
