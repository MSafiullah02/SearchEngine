[1] [2] [3] The tsunami of health care demands for patients with severe COVID-19 has overwhelmed acute care services and has challenged the fellowship training milieu in adult cardiothoracic anesthesiology. 4 The magnitude of this challenge is directly proportional to the intensity of the pandemic at a given institution, which prompted the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) to publish a staged classification system to help guide fellowship management and navigation during the crisis. 4 The ACGME described three stages: Stage 1 -usual operations with minor disruption of fellowship activities; Stage 2 -adjusted operations with mild-tomoderate disruption of fellowship activities; and Stage 3 -crisis mode with moderate-to-severe disruption of fellowship activities (full details available at www.acgme.org/covid-19 , last accessed April 6 th 2020). 4 The purpose of this freestanding editorial is to highlight the significant threats of the current pandemic on the psychological wellbeing of fellows in adult cardiothoracic anesthesiology. [4] [5] These perspectives will attempt to define the challenges and solutions for the program leadership in order to foster the psychological well-being of the fellows and faculty through the duration of this health crisis. The references provide further detail for program leaders to manage the psychological demands of the pandemic in the year ahead.",

[5] [6] [7] [8] [9] The necessity of maintaining psychological health among physicians on the frontline of the pandemic has prompted an analysis of the literature to better understand the threats that COVID-19 poses. [10] [11] The psychological effects of the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) epidemic during 2003-2004 have served as a template for understanding the full spectrum of psychological responses to this crisis. [11] [12] [13] [14] The first set of presentations that program directors may encounter relate to anxiety with or without somatic features. [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] Concomitant sleep disorders were also commonly seen, with insomnia being the most prevalent issue. 5; 14-15 Etiologies of this anxiety included fear of the outbreak, concerns about vulnerability to infection, uncertainties about the treatment process, social distancing, work disruptions, and balancing multiple responsibilities. [14] [15] [16] Mood disturbances were also common, including irritability, anger, grief, and depression that were at times associated with suicidal ideation and/or substance abuse. 5; 10-11 A mix of anxiety and depression could persist and present later as post-traumatic stress traits, or in severe cases, as post-traumatic stress disorder. 10-11; 15-17 The psychological effects of the quarantine process and social distancing similarly include anxiety, frustration, anger, depression, substance abuse, burnout and post-traumatic stress disorder. [4] [5] As such, the reactions to this social isolation are a major consideration in the maintenance of psychological well-being during the coronavirus crisis, as psychological care of our fellows and ourselves is a professional and personal imperative. 5; 18 There are several factors that may negatively impact a trainee's ability to cope with the psychological stress of the pandemic and accompanying quarantine and can be divided into three phases: before the crisis, during the crisis, and after the crisis. 19 ",

            "text": "Psychological well-being during the coronavirus crisis should ideally be part of a multimodal approach to contain the crisis, including synchronized strategies for surges in patient volume, patient acuity, and health care supplies, including personal protective equipment. [1] [2] [3] [4] The fellows can participate as stakeholders during the crisis with the development and deployment of transparent and open communication that includes weekly townhall-style meetings using remote conferencing technology. 20 The program leadership should endeavor to manage the flood of incoming information (the 'infodemic') by highlighting those aspects that are most germane to the fellows from all levels, including the ACGME, the institution, and the department. [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] This ongoing conversation with all stakeholders will facilitate a smooth integration of the adult cardiothoracic anesthesiology fellowship with the larger response to the COVID-19 crisis at departmental, institutional, and national levels. 4 The management of the fellowship will be most challenged during the Stage 3 'crisis mode scenario,' as outlined by the ACGME, wherein fellows may be deployed to other clinical areas in a safe and coordinated fashion to assist in the clinical care of patients with COVID-19. 4 The program director should focus on the graduation trajectory of each fellow to ensure that this goal is preserved during and after the crisis. This path to graduation should be adjusted in real-time with the fellow and his/her mentor network as mandated by the fellow's performance and dynamic policy changes from the ACGME, the American Board of Anesthesiology, and the National Board of Echocardiography. 26-28 7 The fellows may benefit from wellness resources available from their institution. [4] [5] The institutional response to the COVID-19 crisis will likely include a wellness center with a menu of services to engage and support all trainees in their ongoing self-care and maintenance of psychological wellness. 10-11; 25 These pooled resources may include discussion groups, regular news updates, and links to programs that cultivate mindfulness, relaxation, and cognitive skillbuilding. 29 The ACGME also has a catalogue of wellness resources that have been catalogued on its website, including a workshop for cognitive skill development, a wellness mobile application that can be easily downloaded on a mobile device, and a set of podcasts. 30 The workshop provides a platform for program directors to discuss wellness and develop cognition skills with the fellows, covering concepts such as problematic mindsets, metacognition, mindful awareness, cognitive distortions, and cognitive restructuring. 30 After a review of these concepts, the curriculum then develops a set of cognitive tools and strategies that can be applied effectively during this time of crisis. 30 The mobile application has been designed to teach the fellows about common cognitive routines that promote stress and burnout and offer a set of cognitive behavioral strategies to move beyond these negative routines to build a cognitive culture of wellness. 30 The podcast series for the fellows similarly covers common negative mindsets and solutions to encourage psychological health. 30 The podcast series for program leaders has been arranged to introduce available wellness resources and the latest evidence to inform and invigorate the wellness milieu of the fellowship. 30 Beyond these excellent resources from the ACGME, there are further web-based and mobile applications that may help to manage the negative psychological effects of the current crisis. 29 A recent systematic review identified the following web-based and mobile resources that can effectively foster wellness in these categories: meditation (headspace; guided meditation 8 audios); breathing routines (breath2relax); web-based cognitive behavioral therapy (moodgym; stress gym), and suicide prevention applications (stay alive; virtual hope box). 29 This set of resources can also serve to engage the fellows and program leaders in a collaborative effort to foster psychological well-being through and beyond the coronavirus crisis. 29 The goal of these activities is to position the fellows and ourselves firmly in the path towards wellness. Many of these strategies could have a role in promoting wellness not only for the individual but also for the family unit. [29] [30] Effective age-appropriate communication has been emphasized in the promotion of psychological well-being for children during the coronavirus pandemic. [21] [22] This communication should be gentle but honest. [31] [32] It is important to consider that most children between the ages of 4-7 years-old may have 'magical thinking' that may lead the young ones to blame themselves for the current crisis due to their thoughts and behavior. [21] [22] [23] [24] Therefore, listening carefully to their understanding of the crisis remains important to ensure that it is accurate and that it does not burden them with anxiety and guilt. [21] [22] [23] [24] Clearly, children should be referred for professional help as the need arises to ensure that they are able to successfully cope with the psychological demands of the pandemic. 5; 10-11; 21-24",

The ingredients for a successful collective strategy include frequent communication at all-levels, in-depth listening to concerns, developing solutions in real-time, and an emphasis on collective responsibility and teamwork through all phases of the crisis. 25 The overall strategy for navigating the crisis successfully with concomitant promotion of well-being should be dynamic and synchronized to the intensity of the crisis, as defined by the ACGME. 33-34 9 The fellowship timeline with its goals and activities should be managed in an agile fashion dependent on the impact of the crisis in real-time. The response phases could be thought of as conventional capacity (appropriate for Stage 1 in the ACGME framework), contingency capacity (appropriate for Stage 2 in the ACGME framework) and crisis capacity (appropriate for Stage 3 in the ACGME framework). [33] [34] This titrated response to the crisis intensity at the departmental and institutional levels will be greatly enhanced with engaged and thoughtful leadership of the fellowship. The value of a planned phasic and compassionate response for the fellowship cannot be overstated for successful navigation through the current crisis. [33] [34] This crafted path can deliver high-quality patient care and foster resilient fellows who are ready for graduation and life thereafter as well-adjusted practitioners and leaders in our specialty. 26-28; 35-37 The multitude of challenges associated with the COVID-19 pandemic can invigorate the fellowship program with creative leadership in all of its activities. The clinical competency committee will require lean and efficient adaptation to overcome the hurdles through to graduation. [26] [27] [28] Innovations in the fellowship that were prompted by necessary adaptions to the coronavirus crisis can be captured and developed through the reflections and records of the program evaluation committee. 35 The engaging and energetic landscape of the fellowship can serve as an mentoring platform for the program faculty, including associate and assistant program directors to create and configure the new path ahead through the challenges of this crisis for both the graduating and incoming fellow classes.
