The development of a ductular system is the result of coordinated interplay between the endodermal cells and the local mesenchymal elements. Endocrine components of the pancreas, cells composing the islets of Langerhans and endocrine cells scattered individually between and within acini, are also endodermal in origin. Cell populations that serve as progenitors within the mature pancreas (mesenchymal stem cells) are being defined. The presence of acinar and ductular structures typical of exocrine pancreas within islet cell tumors is likely the manifestation of maturation of progenitor cells along different pathways of differentiation. Understanding the histogenesis and differentiation of islet cells from mesenchymal stem cell populations has developed new importance in recent years as minimal success is met by efforts to transplant insulin-producing beta cells to cure DM. Dogs have been used to study plasticity of pancreatic cell populations and respond to an islet neogenesis-associated protein, an initiator of islet development.",

Under normal physiological conditions, precursor enzymes are activated once they reach the lumen of the duodenum, through the sequential activation of trypsinogen to trypsin, followed by trypsin-mediated cleavage of other proenzymes (Figures 2\nand 3\n).",

Often, acinar cells within a lobule or group of acini will have similar volume of zymogen granules, which may be different from adjacent lobules, so there may be some level of regional regulation of secretion. During fasting or starvation, autophagic removal of cytoplasmic proteins and decreased production of zymogens reduce the size of the acinar cell. Other features of nutritional exocrine atrophy include loss of apical\u2013basal polarity and vacuolation of the cytoplasm. In contrast, high levels of dietary carbohydrate and protein will result in hypertrophy and hyperplasia of the acinar cells. In some animal species, there is seasonal variation of pancreatic morphology. For example, in free-living geckos (Gekkonidae), there is a reduction of acinar cell numbers and therefore exocrine volume during the dry season, when food supplies are scarce.",

In human beings, epithelial cells lining the ducts may undergo a series of progressively malignant changes that may result in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma.

Briefly, several functionally different populations of endocrine cells in the islet produce and secrete hormones directly into the capillaries that course through the islet. The alpha, beta, delta, gamma (PP), and epsilon cells produce glucagon, insulin and amylin (islet amyloid polypeptide), somatostatin, pancreatic polypeptide, and ghrelin, respectively. Insulin secretion from the islets of Langerhans promotes glucose absorption, lowering blood glucose levels, whereas glucagon has an opposite effect, resulting in elevation of blood glucose levels. Amylin functions to regulate gastric emptying, thus affecting the availability of gastric contents for digestion in the small intestine and affecting the glycemic response. Ghrelin, secreted by epsilon cells of the islet and in the mucosa of the gastric fundus, plays a significant role in the control of appetite, thereby affecting availability of dietary carbohydrate. In the pancreas, pancreatic polypeptide functions to regulate the secretions of pancreatic cells in both endocrine and exocrine compartments. Somatostatin, produced by delta cells and other locations in the digestive system, regulates the release of a variety of hormones, both within the islets and in other organs. Blood flow through the islet and exocrine portions of the pancreas is arranged to sequentially distribute hormones to different environmental niches to coordinate appropriate hormonal control of digestion and metabolism. Immunostaining is used to identify the different populations of endocrine cells (Figure 6\n).",

As a better understanding of the relationships between adiposity and systemic disease (such as DM and low-grade systemic inflammation) is developed, the view of this condition as incidental may change, particularly in species prone to type 2 DM (discussed in the succeeding text in this article). Increased amounts of lipid are stored as intracellular triglyceride in cells usually located at the periphery of lobules or in septa, suggesting storage in mesenchymal cells of the septal stroma. Apparent expansion of the volume of mesenteric adipose tissue also occurs in exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI) (discussed later in this article), concurrent with loss of acinar volume (Figure 12\n).",

In addition, metabolic changes during pregnancy are sometimes related to the development of elevated levels of blood glucose and are termed \u2018gestational diabetes.\u2019 There are important differences in the incidence, pathogenesis, and consequences of this disease among animal species, although similarities to the disease in human beings exist. Risk factors include increasing age. Obesity is important in some animals (cats), whereas it does not appear to predispose others (dogs) to developing DM. Diabetes and metabolic syndrome resulting from insulin resistance is being recognized as an important disease in horses. The incidence of reporting of DM among exotic animals is increasing, probably due to enhanced medical care of these animals.

Obese dogs do have elevated postprandial levels of insulin, glucose, and triglyceride, but members of a small cohort of obese dogs followed for several years did not develop clinical signs of DM. Dogs maintain high fasting concentrations of insulin in order to compensate for insulin resistance and are able to maintain normal blood glucose levels.

It is, however, also present at a low incidence in some clinically normal cats, so it is not pathognomonic for type 2 DM in cats.
