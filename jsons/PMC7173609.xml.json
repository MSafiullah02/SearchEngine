Such aerosols contain large droplets which settle before evaporating and microdroplets which evaporate before settling, and thus produce dry droplet nuclei less than 5 \u03bcm in diameter.

Their relative frequency accounts for the difficulty of tracing chains of transmission, even with the help of laboratory aids. Although clinical cases may be somewhat more productive sources of virus than subclinical infections, the latter are more numerous and, because they do not restrict the movement of infected animals, can be an important source of viral dissemination.

Measles has long been a favorite disease for modeling epidemics, because it is one of the few common human diseases in which subclinical infections are rare and clinical diagnosis is easy. Persistence of measles virus in a population depends on a continuous supply of susceptible hosts. Analyses of the incidence of measles in large cities and in island communities have shown that a population of about half a million persons is needed to ensure a large enough annual input of new susceptible hosts, by birth or immigration, to maintain measles virus in the population.",

On the other hand, in such a situation a break in the transmission chain is much more likely. When a large proportion of the population is initially susceptible, the intensity of the epidemic builds up very quickly and attack rates are almost 100% (a virgin-soil epidemic). There are many examples of similar transmission patterns among animal viruses, but the quantitative data are not as complete as those for measles. Exotic viruses, i.e., those which are not present in a particular country or region, represent the most important group of viruses with a potential for causing virgin-soil epizootics.",

Cattle and wild ruminants of all ages were susceptible, and the mortality was so high that in northern Tanzania the ground was so littered with the carcasses of cattle that a Masai tribesman commented that \u201cthe vultures had forgotten how to fly.\u201d The development of effective vaccines in the 1920s changed the epidemiology of rinderpest, leading to a period in the 1960s when its global eradication was anticipated. Unfortunately, in the 1970s vaccination programs in West Africa were poorly maintained and by the 1980s the disease had once more become rampant and the cause of major losses in many parts of Africa. The cyclical nature of the occurrence of such diseases is determined by several variables, including the rate of buildup of susceptible animals, introduction of the virus, and environmental conditions which promote viral spread.",

Influenza viruses and poxviruses survive better in air at low rather than at high humidity, and in aerosols all viruses survive better at lower temperatures.

Because of the present advanced state of diagnostic and serological virology, such studies now yield a much greater array of valuable data than was possible a few years ago, but they are very expensive and require long-term dedication of both personnel and money. When used principally for the detection of virus in an area, such investigations are referred to as sentinel studies, and are widely used for studying the prevalence of arbovirus infections. For example, sentinel chickens are used for the early detection of eastern equine and St. Louis encephalitis viruses in the southern United States. When used for the estimation of the value of vaccines or therapeutic agents, long-term herd studies have the exceptional advantage that they include all of the variables attributable to the entire husbandry system.",

            "text": "The term molecular epidemiology has been applied to the use of molecular biological methods for epidemiological investigation of viral diseases. All the techniques described in Chapter 13 can be used. With DNA viruses and retroviruses, restriction endonuclease fingerprinting or mapping provides a means of identification of viral strains with a specificity that often surpasses serological methods, e.g., with pseudorabies virus. With viruses that have segmented genomes, like orbiviruses and rotaviruses, polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis provides a method of genome analysis that is a valuable supplement to serological typing of these viruses. The genome of a poliovirus isolate recovered from a paralyzed (or normal) person can be sequenced to determine whether it is a wild-type strain, an attenuated vaccine strain, or a vaccine strain that has reacquired neurovirulence as a result of subsequent mutations. Other techniques such as nucleic acid hybridization and oligonucleotide fingerprinting can also distinguish strains of virus within the same serotype. For example, the 1981 outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in the United Kingdom was traced by oligonucleotide fingerprinting to the presence of live virus in an inactivated vaccine (see Chapter 23). Monoclonal antibodies provide a powerful method of distinguishing viruses that cannot be readily differentiated by serology employing polyclonal antibodies. This method has been particularly useful in elucidating the relationships between rabies virus and rabieslike rhabdoviruses and in distinguishing geographical variants of rabies virus. We can expect to see all these techniques become incorporated into standard epidemiological investigations in the future; properly used, they become tools for much more precise analyses of the role of specific viruses in particular disease outbreaks.",

First, transovarial infection in ticks is sufficient to ensure survival of the virus, independently of a cycle in vertebrates; vertebrate infection serves to amplify the population of infected ticks. Second, transmission of this arbovirus from one vertebrate host to another can also occur by a mechanism not involving an arthropod at all, namely, via milk. Tick-borne encephalitis is widespread in central Europe and the eastern part of the Soviet Union. A variety of mammals may be infected in nature; small rodents are the most important. Goats, cows, and sheep are incidental hosts and sustain inapparent infections, but they excrete virus in their milk. Adult and juvenile animals may acquire the virus during grazing on tick-infested pastures, and suckling animals may be infected by drinking infected milk. Humans may be infected in two ways; they may enter natural foci of infection in pursuit of work or recreation and become infected by tick bite, or they may acqure infection from milk. All milkborne outbreaks have been associated with goat's milk.",

In constructing this model, the aim was to simulate the spread of foot-and-mouth disease across the United States commencing at the stage where the disease became established and traditional control measures (quarantine, slaughter, and disinfection) were no longer effective. The model was based on data collected from the 1967\u20131968 epizootic of foot-and-mouth disease in the United Kingdom during which outbreaks of disease were recorded on 2364 farms. The objective was to simulate a major epizootic. The state transition model is a general model that permits a variety of disease control strategies to be examined. It illustrates several key characteristics of a useful model: (1) its pathways are intuitively acceptable, (2) it behaves in a biologically and mathematically logical way (i.e., it is sensitive to appropriate variables), (3) it mimics real-life situations, and (4) it is simple enough to be rigorously tested, but complex enough to represent the system being studied. (B) Pathways of transitions in the model. The basic unit is the herd (or farm), which is in one of four mutually exclusive categories: \u201csusceptible,\u201d \u201cinfectious,\u201d \u201cimmune,\u201d or \u201cremoved/dead.\u201d Each week the probability of each transition is calculated and the number of herds in each category during the next week are derived. A key factor in determining the probability of a susceptible herd becoming infected in a particular week is the dissemination rate. This depends on a number of factors such as topography, weather, husbandry, animal movement, and quarantine. The dissemination rate used for the \u201cscenario\u201d shown in the figure is based on that calculated for the 1967\u20131968 epidemic in the United Kingdom. With a dissemination rate diminishing at a rate only slightly more slowly than in the United Kingdom, a situation whereby the traditional controls would be abandoned could be reached 4\u20135 weeks after introduction of the virus to the United States.",
