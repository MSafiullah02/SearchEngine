            "text": "Strains of coronavirus (CV) can be responsible for acute diarrhea in different animal species [1] . The enteropathogenic role of CVs in humans, however, has not been definitely established. Evidence for association of CV infection and gastroenteritis in man has been obtained mainly by using electron microscopy to detect CV-like particles in the feces of patients with diarrhea [2] [3] [4] . Because of the extreme difficulty with isolation and propagation in tissue culture, the candidate human enteric CVs (HECVs) have not been adequately characterized. Recently, we reported the possible implication of HECV strains in acute infantile gastroenteritis [5] . By immune electron microscopy (IEM) these strains appeared to be antigenically related to human coronavirus (HCV) OC43, a known respiratory pathogenic virus, but further characterization of the HECV strains was hampered by failure to isolate and propagate them in tissue culture. Beards et al. [6] described other fringed pleomorphic viral particles detected by electron microscopy in stools from children and adults with diarrhea. These viral particles were morphologically more similar to toroviruses of the Berne-Breda group (to which they were shown by IEM to be antigenically related) than to typical CVs. In this report, we attempted further characterization of two HECV strains purified from stools of two infants with acute gastroenteritis. Although the amounts of virus were low, we could determine the pattern of migration of their polypeptides in SDS-PAGE and examine the antibody response to the viral proteins electrophoretically transferred to nitrocellulose after SDS-PAGE. In addition, we investigated by IEM the antigenic relation between the HECY strains and viruses of the Berne-Breda group.",

Highand low-molecular-weight markers (BioRad Laboratories) were included in each gel run.

Electrophoretic transfer was done at a constant voltage of 3 Y/cm for 20 hr in a water-cooled Transblot\u00ae cell (BioRad Laboratories). Under these conditions, proteins <200 kilodaltons (kDa) were transferred at a very high efficiency, as determined by silver staining of portions of the same gels before and after transfer and by staining of nitrocellulose blots with india ink or with colloidal gold (Aurodye, Janssen Pharmaceutica, Beerse, Belgium). The immunological detection of electrophoretically transferred proteins was performed by indirect immunoperoxidase, essentially as reported for dot-immunobinding by Hawkes 141 et al. [12] . Test sera were examined at 1:50 and 1:100 dilutions. The working dilutions of conjugates (Cappel Laboratories, Cooper Biomedical, Malvern, Pa) were determined by checkerboard titration against serial dilutions of IgG of the appropriate animal species in a dotimmunobinding procedure [12] . The relative molecular weights of immunochemically detected proteins were determined by comparison of migration with molecular weight markers visualized on blots by india ink and colloidal gold.",

The two HECV strains were antigenically distinct from viruses of the Berne-Breda group and indistinguishable from each other. Thus, these HECV strains are probably different from the Breda-like enveloped viral particles found by Beards et al. [6] in stools from children and adults with diarrhea. The immunoblotting results are in contrast with the antigenic relation between HECV and OC43 detected by IEM. It seems reasonable, however, that denaturation of HECV proteins in the presence of dissociating and reducing agents could have destroyed the antigenic determinant(s) responsible for their IEM cross-reactivity with HCV OC43. Unfortunately, the amounts of purified HECV were too scarce to allow further immunoblotting studies with unreduced viral proteins and extensive serological examinations of patients with gastroenteritis. In conclusion, HECVs appear to be antigenically distinct from viruses of the Berne-Breda group and antigenically related to HCV OC43. The preliminary characterization of HECV polypeptides appears promising and suggests that more-extensive studies on HECV should be done to obtain futher data on its biology and to further define its epidemiology and its pathological role. MASSIMO of this hospital between 1983 and 1985, we found that five of seven had a fulminant evolution. This fulminant evolution apparently resulted from nonsteroidal antiinflammatory therapy.",
