Although MAbs produced in mammalian cell culture systems have achieved remarkable clinical success, their high cost, long manufacturing time, and restricted production capacity have limited the availability, utility and potential of these drugs. Several of these challenges might be overcome by using plant expression systems, because they offer scalable production of MAbs at low cost with a low risk of introducing adventitious human or animal pathogens [1]\u2013[3]. Functional antibody production requires a eukaryotic host cell that can assemble four antibody polypeptides into a heterotetramer and perform complex N-linked glycosylation. Despite this complexity, a MAb was successfully expressed in tobacco plants only three years after the first plant-made biologic [4]. Since then, a variety of MAbs and their derivatives, such as IgG, IgA, single-chain variable fragments (scFv), and diabodies have been produced in plants [3]. The largest reported MAb-based molecule produced in plants is a recombinant immune complex (RIC) [5]. The ability of plants to express and assemble larger or more complex MAb-derived molecules such as tetravalent MAbs or bifunctional MAbs has not been described.",

Historically, WNV was an Old World disease found mostly in the Eastern Europe, Africa, and the Middle East. However, in 1999, WNV entered the Western hemisphere and subsequently spread across the United States (US), Canada, the Caribbean region and Latin America [7] with outbreaks occurring on an annual basis. The elderly and immunocompromised are the most vulnerable for developing severe neurological disease, long-term morbidity, and death [8], although genetic factors also are associated with an increase risk of disease [9], [10]. Currently, there is no vaccine or therapeutic approved for human use. The global threat of WNV epidemics and the lack of treatment warrant the development of antiviral therapeutics and production platforms that can bring products to market at low cost. We previously reported a plant-derived, humanized murine MAb (pHu-E16) that binds to an epitope on domain III (DIII) of WNV envelope (E) protein, as a post-exposure therapeutic candidate for WNV [11]. We demonstrated that pHu-E16 was produced at high levels and assembled efficiently in both Nicotiana benthamiana and lettuce plants [11], [12]. pHu-E16 retained antigen binding specificity, neutralized WNV infection, and protected mice from lethal infection equivalently compared to the mammalian cell-produced Hu-E16 (mHu-E16) [11]. Because WNV is a neurotropic virus, peripheral delivery of pHu-E16, however, likely will have a limited window of efficacy due to its inability to cross the blood brain barrier (BBB) efficiently and accumulate in the brain at concentrations sufficient for neutralization. Thus, it would be desirable to develop pHu-E16 variants, such as bifunctional MAbs, that can cross the BBB while retaining targeted therapeutic activity.",

            "text": "To test the ability of plants in producing such complex MAb variants, here we expressed several pHu-E16 derivatives including a pHu-E16scFv fused to the heavy chain (HC) constant domains (CH\n1-3) of human IgG (pHu-E16scFv-CH\n1-3) and a large tetravalent molecule (Tetra pHu-E16) assembled from pHu-E16scFv-CH\n1-3 with another pHu-E16scFv fused to the light chain (LC) constant region (CL) (pHu-E16scFv-CL). We demonstrated that plants can express and assemble these pHu-E16 variants efficiently. These pHu-E16 variants also showed at least equivalent protection as the parent pHu-E16 or mHu-E16 against a lethal WNV challenge in a mouse model. Our results also revealed differences in N-linked glycosylation pattern between different MAb variants, and demonstrated that the proper pairing of HC and LC was essential for the complete N-glycan processing of antibodies in both plant and animal cells. We also found that pHu-E16, pHu-E16scFv-CH\n1-3 and Tetra pHu-E16 exhibited differential binding to specific Fc\u03b3 receptors (Fc\u03b3Rs) and C1q, the complement opsonin that activates the classical complement pathway. In human K562 cells, none of the plant-derived Hu-E16 variants showed significant antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) activity, a phenomenon that is an impediment for developing MAb-based therapeutics against flaviviruses, such as the related Dengue virus. Overall, this study demonstrates the capacity of a plant to assemble a large and complex IgG-like tetravalent MAb, which offers a step forward toward the development of bifunctional MAbs in plants.",

            "text": "An important prerequisite for the generation of bifunctional Hu-E16 MAb is the correct assembly of its functional component: pHu-E16scFv-CH\n1-3. The DNA sequence of the variable region of HC (VH) and LC (VL) of pHu-E16 [11] was fused together first to generate pHu-E16scFv, and then fused to the coding sequence of the CH\n1-3 of human IgG1 (\nFig 1A\n). The resulting coding sequence of pHu-E16scFv-CH\n1-3 was cloned into a MagnICON-based plant expression vector [13], and transformed into Agrobacterium tumefaciens. A. tumefaciens strains containing the pHu-E16scFv-CH\n1-3 construct were co-delivered into N. benthamiana leaves along with the promoter module and an integrase construct through agroinfiltration [14], [15]. Western blot analysis after reducing or non-reducing gel electrophoresis confirmed that pHu-E16scFv-CH\n1-3 was produced in leaves with the expected molecular weight (\nFig 1B\n\n, Lane 5), and that it assembled into a dimer (\nFig 1D\n\n, Lane 7). ELISA results also indicated that pHu-E16scFv-CH1-3 reached the highest level of accumulation 9 days post infiltration (dpi) with A. tumefaciens, with an average accumulation of 0.8 mg/g leaf fresh weight (LFW) (\nFig 2\n). This level is similar to that previously reported for the parent pHu-E16 MAb, and is among the highest expression levels for MAbs in plants ever described [3], [11], [16].",

Accordingly, we next examined the N-glycoforms of pHu-E16scFv-CH\n1-3 by liquid-chromatography-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS) to assess whether the extent of N-linked glycosylation was similar to that of the parent pHu-E16. pHu-E16 exhibited the expected complex-type N-glycans (GnGnXF, \nTable 1\n) that are typical for plant-produced IgGs [18]. However, pHu-E16scFv-CH\n1-3 displayed oligomannosidic structures, predominantly Man8 and Man9 (\nTable 1\n). The predominantly endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-type N-glycans of pHu-E16scFv-CH\n1-3 were unexpected, as this molecule was targeted for secretion and not tagged with an ER-retention signal KDEL. To investigate if this is a phenomenon specific to plant cells, we also compared the N-glycan profiles of the same Hu-E16 variants produced in mammalian cells (mHu-E16 and mHu-E16scFv-CH\n1-3). We observed a substantial amount of oligomannosidic glycans (oligoman, mostly M5 and M7) in mHu-E16scFv-CH\n1-3 in addition to the predominant complex-type glycans (GnGnF6 and AGnF6), whereas no such glycans were observed in mHu-E16 (\nTable 1\n). This result suggests that the unusual N-linked glycosylation pattern of scFv-CH\n1-3 is not unique to plants but also is shared by mammalian cells, even though the percentage and the particular species of oligomannosidic glycans differ between cells from the two species.",

            "text": "The success of pHu-E16 scFv-CH\n1-3 expression and assembly in plants indicates the feasibility of developing an IgG-like tetravalent MAb variant. Such a form could provide four WNV antigen-binding sites or enable development of bifunctional MAbs that offer divalent binding to two different antigens. For example, bifunctional MAbs could be engineered to bind a BBB receptor as its second antigen to enhance transport into the brain and extend the window of treatment for neuroinvasive WNV infection. To understand the basis of the difference in N-linked glycans between pHu-E16scFv-CH\n1-3 and its parent pHu-E16 and develop a potentially more effective WNV therapeutic, we engineered and expressed three additional pHu-E16 variants with various combinations of HC and LC components. First, pHu-E16scFv was fused to the plant-codon optimized CL (pHu-E16scFv-CL). Three pHu-E16 variants were then produced in N. benthamiana plants by the co-expression of the following Hu-E16 construct combinations: scFv-CH1-3/LC, HC/scFv-CL, and scFv-CH\n1-3/scFv-CL (\nFig 1A\n). Western blot analysis after reducing gel electrophoresis confirmed that each component of the variants was produced in plants with the expected molecular weight (\nFig 1B and C\n\n, Lanes 2\u20134). These protein bands were specific to the infiltrated molecular constructs and were not detected in samples from negative control plant leaves (\nFig 1B and C\n\n, Lane 6). Moreover, western blotting after non-reducing gel electrophoresis revealed that the two polypeptides in each combination assembled into an IgG-like heterotetramer (\nFig 1D\n\n, Lanes 2\u20134 and\n\nFig 1A\n). The successful expression and assembly of pHu-E16scFv-CH\n1-3 with pHu-E16scFv-CL to form a tetravalent molecule (Tetra pHu-E16, \nFig 1B-D\n\n, Lane 3, and\n\nFig 1A\n) in plants is noteworthy, as the assembly of such large and complex MAb variants has not been reported previously. Yield analysis by ELISA established that Tetra pHu-E16 and other variants reached the highest level of production at 9 dpi. Nonetheless, the expression level varied between the three pHu-E16 variants, with HC/scFv-CL's comparable to that of the parent pHu-E16 and pHu-E16scFv-CH\n1-3 (690 \u03bcg/g LFW), scFv-CH1-3/LC's (430 \u03bcg/g LFW), and Tetra pHu-E16 (240 \u03bcg/g LFW) produced at slightly lower levels (\nFig 2\n).",

Co-expression of LC of pHu-E16 increased the percentage of complex-type glycans in pHu-E16scFv-CH\n1-3 (\nTable 1\n). In Tetra pHu-E16, the co-expression and pairing of scFv-CH\n1-3/scFv-CL also increased the amount of complex-type N-glycans (\nTable 1\n), albeit not to the same level as in the scFv-CH\n1-3/LC combination. In contrast, pairing of the HC of pHu-E16 with scFv-CL yielded a predominantly complex-type N-linked glycosylation pattern, similar to that of the parent pHu-E16 (\nTable 1\n).

Since WNV spreads to the brain in mice by day 4 after infection [25], we investigated the efficacy of pHu-E16 variants at this time point. Initially, a 500 \u03bcg dose was used as a direct comparison to our prior published results [11], [25]; similar levels of protection were observed between mHu-E16 and pHu-E16scFv-CH\n1-3 (data not shown). To define a lower limit of protection, we used a dose of 50 \u03bcg (\nFig 7B\n). Notably, 70% of mice were protected from lethal infection when 50 \u03bcg of pHu-E16scFv-CH\n1-3 was given 4 days after WNV inoculation, similar to that observed with mHu-E16 performed in parallel (\nFig 7B, \nP\n>0.6). A single administration of 50 \u03bcg of Tetra pHu-E16 protected up to 90% of mice from lethal infection, compared with an 80% survival rated achieved by mHu-E16 (\nFig 7B\n).

It suffered from low-yield, long lead time to generate and select transgenic plants, and unstable seed banks largely due to the randomness of transgene integration in the plant genome (position effect), the lack of control in transgene copy number, and the shortage of strong promoters to drive transgene expression [3]. This greatly undermined the cost-saving potential of the plant expression systems. The development of transient expression systems based on deconstructed virus vectors has increased the speed and yield of MAb production in plants [13], [26]\u2013[28]. For example, with the MagnICON and geminiviral vectors, MAbs can be obtained within 10 days of vector infiltration into N. benthamiana and lettuce plants with yields up to 1 mg MAb/g LFW [11], [12], [29]\u2013[31]. Although MAb derivatives, such as scFv, diabodies, and RIC have been produced in plants [3], [5], [32], the ability of plants to express and assemble larger or more complex MAb-derived molecules such as IgG-like tetravalent MAbs or bifunctional MAbs has not been reported.",

Our results showed that two Hu-E16scFvs each genetically fused to the CH\n1-3 and CL fragment of IgG can be produced efficiently in N. benthamiana leaves. The Hu-E16scFv-CH\n1-3 and Hu-E16scFv-CL efficiently assembled into an IgG-like molecule. Our study also demonstrated that the tetravalent pHu-E16 retained antigen-binding and neutralization activity in vitro. Most importantly, a single dose of Tetra-pHu-E16 protected mice at least equivalently as mHu-E16 against a lethal WNV infection several days after exposure. To our knowledge, this is the first example in a plant of expression and assembly of a large and complex IgG-like tetravalent functional molecule, although a structurally unrelated secretory IgA (sIgA) molecule assembled from polypeptides of four gene products was produced in stable transgenic plants [4]. Tetra pHu-E16 was expressed rapidly in N. benthamiana leaves and reached its highest level of accumulation 9 days after leaf infiltration. While its expression level is slightly lower than that of pHu-E16, this level is within the range feasible for commercial production [33], and likely can be increased by further genetic optimization [3]. Tetra-pHu-E16 and other variants were recovered efficiently to high (>90%) purity with a two-step purification process. In addition to plant host proteins, this process also effectively removed other contaminants including endotoxin, with its levels ranging from 5.2 to 8.6 EU/ml in the purified product (Q. Chen, unpublished data). The rapid accumulation and assembly of Tetra pHu-16 and the availability of a scalable and current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) compliant purification scheme suggest the viability of such molecules as a platform for novel therapeutic candidates.",

Even though mHu-E16 [11], [25], pHu-E16 [11], [25], pHu-E16scFv-CH\n1-3, and Tetra pHu-E16 showed excellent efficacy, their window of clinical treatment will be limited via peripheral delivery systems. These current MAb-based molecules cannot accumulate to high levels in the brain unless there is widespread inflammation and breakdown of the BBB. Thus, it would be desirable to develop pHu-E16 variants that can cross the BBB more efficiently. One possible strategy is to develop IgG-like bifunctional MAbs that have a similar structure as the Tetra pHu-E16, but are assembled from scFvs that bind to two disparate antigens. For example, one of the two scFvs could bind to a specific receptor (e.g., insulin receptor [34]) on BBB to facilitate its transport into the brain, and the other scFv would retain its binding to and neutralization of WNV in the brain. The successful production and assembly of Tetra pHu-E16 and the demonstration of its therapeutic activity bring us closer to developing such Hu-E16 bifunctional MAbs to prolong the window of its efficacy.",

            "text": "The N-linked glycosylation of MAbs affects its stability, Fc\u03b3R and C1q binding, pharmacokinetics, effector function and efficacy [17]. N-linked glycosylation occurs as a series of post-translational modification steps initiated in the ER and processed through different compartments of the Golgi complex of the host cell. Altering the structure of a protein or its folding may affect glycan modification and the corresponding cellular localization [35], [36]. However, the impact of structural variations in the native IgG on N-linked glycosylation has not been studied extensively. Here, we first examined the difference in the N-linked glycans of pHu-E16 IgG and its pHu-E16scFv-CH\n1-3 variant. Our results revealed that their N-linked glycan profiles were different from one another. pHu-E16 exhibited the expected complex-type N-linked glycans [18], confirming it was fully processed through the endomembrane system and secreted into the apoplast as designed. In contrast, pHu-E16scFv-CH\n1-3 predominantly displayed Man8 and Man9-types of oligomannosidic structures, which indicates incomplete glycan processing and suggests its aberrant localization in ER or ER-derived vesicles. A similar observation in glycoforms and aberrant subcellular deposition was reported for Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) seed-derived 2G12scFV-Fc, a MAb variant recognizing Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and to a lesser extend, for HA78scFv-Fc, an anti-hepatitis A virus MAb also produced in Arabidopsis seed [35]. However, in the same study, leaf-derived HA78scFv-Fc displayed the expected complex-type N-glycans, whereas leaf-produced 2G12scFv-Fc exhibited the ER-typical oligomannosidic glycans and was functionally inactive [35]. These observations suggest that beside the polypeptide component of scFv-Fcs, the type of plant tissue (e.g. seed vs. leaf) and plant species also may impact the N-linked glycosylation status of scFv-Fc variants. It should be noted that the structures of 2G12scFv-Fc and HA78scFv-Fc are different from pHu-E16scFv-CH\n1-3, as their scFvs were fused to the Fc fragment (hinge-CH\n2-3) of IgG and lack the HC constant region 1 domain (CH\n1). To investigate if this was a phenomenon unique to plant cells, we compared the N-linked glycan profiles of the equivalent Hu-E16 counterpart variants produced in mammalian cells. Our results indicated that in addition to the predominant complex-type glycans (GnGnF6 and AGnF6), mHu-E16scFv-CH\n1-3 also had a substantial amount of oligomannosidic glycans, mostly M5 and M7, whereas no such glycans were observed in the native IgG version of mHu-E16. This result suggests that at least for Hu-E16, the unusual N-linked glycosylation of scFv-CH\n1-3 is not unique to plants but shared by mammalian cells, even though the percentage and the particular species of oligomannosidic glycans varies between the two cell types.",

            "text": "To provide further insight for this N-glycosylation difference, we expressed three additional pHu-E16 variants with various combinations of HC and LC components. We were particularly interested in examining whether LC or the proper pairing of HC and LC impacted the N-linked glycosylation of MAb and its variants. Co-expression of LC with pHu-E16scFv-CH\n1-3 increased its level of complex N-linked glycans percentage. In Tetra pHu-E16, the co-expression and pairing of scFv-CL with scFv-CH\n1-3 also increased the amount of complex-type N-linked glycans. Furthermore, the pairing of the HC of pHu-E16 with scFv-CL resulted in a predominantly complex-type N-linked glycosylation pattern, similar to seen with the parent pHu-E16. These results support the hypothesis that CL domain of an antibody is essential for its secretion in the cell [36]. It was suggested previously that HC dimers are retained in the ER by the chaperone BiP and are released only upon binding with CL to ensure its proper folding [37]. Our results corroborate this and highlight the importance of LC pairing with HC for the proper processing of antibody N-linked glycosylation. We speculate that in the absence of LC pHu-E16scFv-CH\n1-3 was retained in the ER by BiP, which prevented its transport within the endomembrane system and resulted in the observed ER-typical oligomannosidic glycoform. In contrast, co-expression of LC or pHu-E16scFv-CL enabled the CL domain to release pHu-E16scFv-CH\n1-3 from BiP and to transport it to the Golgi compartments for further assembly, glycan processing and secretion. While the N-linked glycosylation of the scFv-CH\n1-3 and scFv-Fc variant may be regulated by many factors, our results suggest that the lack of CL and its pairing with the CH\n1 contributes to the aberrant N-linked glycosylation and intracellular localization of pHu-E16scFv-CH\n1-3 and other previously reported scFv-Fcs; the impact of this process may vary depending on the specific scFv-Fc/scFv-CH\n1-3 or the cell type in which it was produced.",

While N-linked glycosylation of proteins in plants is similar to that of mammalian cells, WT plants add plant-specific \u03b2-1,2-xylose and core \u03b1-1,3-fucose residues to complex N-linked glycans and lack terminal \u03b21,4-Gal and N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac) residues [38], [39]. Differences in protein glycosylation between WT plant and mammalian cells remain a reservation of plant-expression platforms for human therapies, because they could produce glycoforms that alter efficacy or result in plant-glycan specific immune responses that can accelerate protein clearance or cause potential adverse effects through immune complex formation. To overcome this challenge, glycosylation pathway in N. benthamiana and several other plants has been \u201chumanized\u201d through glycoengineering, for example, by genetically suppressing or eliminating enzymes for the biosynthesis of plant-specific glycans and by introducing glycoenzymes from mammalian cells [39]. These efforts have lead to the creation of a portfolio of \u201chumanized\u201d plant lines that produce MAbs that lack plant-specific glycans and produce glycoforms that are essentially mammalian [39]. For example, a double knockout (\u0394XF) N. benthamiana plant line suppresses the expression of \u03b1-1,3-fucosyltransferase and \u03b2-1,2-xylosyltransferase and was used for production of an anti-Ebola MAb 13F6 [31], [40]. 13F6 produced in the \u0394XF plant line had no plant-specific N-glycans and 90% of 13F6 had the predicted mammalian glycoform GnGn [31]. In contrast, mammalian cell-produced 13F6 had a mixture of 3\u20135 glycoforms with the most dominant glycoform (G0) ranging from 35\u201353% [31]. The high glycan homogeneity of plant-made 13F6 and the lack of core fucose increased its protection of mice against a lethal Ebola virus challenge compared to the mammalian cell produced 13F6 [31]. We plan to express pHu-E16 scFv-CH\n1-3, Tetra-E16, and other variants in these \u201chumanized\u201d N. benthamiana lines to produce highly uniform mammalian glycoforms.",

The highly homogenous and defined nature of N-glycans displayed by plant-derived MAbs provides the opportunity to develop MAb glycoforms that enhance the efficacy through modulating their effector function. For example, plant-produced 13F6 has a higher affinity to Fc\u03b3RIII (CD16) than its mammalian cell-produced counterpart, and provided better protection against Ebola virus challenge in mice presumably via enhanced ADCC activity [31]. Here, we found that due to their distinct N-glycoforms, pHu-E16, pHu-E16scFv-CH\n1-3, and Tetra pHu-E16 exhibited differential binding to C1q and several Fc\u03b3Rs including CD16V158, CD16F158 CD32A-R131 and CD32A-H131, CD32B, and CD64. For example, although pHu-E16 showed reduced binding to all Fc\u03b3Rs and C1q, pHu-E16scFv-CH\n1-3 demonstrated slightly enhanced binding to the low-affinity (CD16F158) isoform of CD16A and CD64, and maintained similar binding to the high-affinity (CD16V158) CD16A isoform as mHu-E16. This diversity of binding affinity to C1q and various Fc\u03b3Rs by an individual MAb variant molecule will allow investigation of the impact of glycan moieties on MAb effector function and the development of MAb variants that are best suited for its efficacy or safety depending on the particular clinical application.",

            "text": "In addition to ADCC and CDC, the interaction between Fc and Fc\u03b3Rs can have pathogenic consequences. For example, one of the major impediments towards developing antibody-based therapeutics for certain flavivirus infections (e.g., Dengue virus) is the at least theoretical risk of ADE, which may render anti-flavivirus MAb treated subjects more susceptible to infection. ADE occurs because sub-neutralizing concentrations of antibodies (including therapeutic MAbs) form complexes with the infecting flavivirus that bind to Fc\u03b3R-bearing cells, resulting in increased virus uptake and infection [19]\u2013[21]. We investigated whether the unique binding of pHu-E16 variants to Fc\u03b3Rs affected ADE. Our results demonstrated that all pHu-E16 variants lost ADE activity on CD32A-expressing K562 cells. Thus, plant complex-type N-glycans or the mammalian form of oligomannosidic glycans carried by plant-produced pHu-E16 variants do not induce the development of ADE efficiently on cells bearing CD32A, consistent with their loss of binding in vitro as shown by SPR. In a separate experiment, we observed that ADE also was eliminated for a glycoengineered plant-derived pHu-E16 that carried the mammalian glycoform of GnGn (data not shown). Collectively, these results demonstrate the potential of plant-made MAbs and their variants to be used as therapeutics against ADE-prone viruses. Although it was previously reported that an aglycosylated version of a MAb can eliminate the risk of ADE [41], [42], the complete removal of N-linked glycans and the resulting abolishment of binding to C1q also may compromise the efficacy of a MAb that uses CDC activity. Plant-derived MAb glycolvariants that minimize ADE but retain C1q binding might have better efficacy than their aglycosylated counterparts. While ADE is not a critical issue for WNV infection, it is relevant to the closely related Dengue virus, and some coronaviruses, paramyxoviruses, and lentiviruses [43].",

Leaves were harvested 9 dpi for other protein analysis. Extraction and purification of pHu-E16 variants from plant leaves were performed with a method previously reported for pHu-E16 MAb [11]. Briefly, leaves were homogenized in extraction buffer (PBS, 1mM EDTA, 10 mg/ml sodium ascorbate, 10 \u03bcg/ml leupeptin, and 0.3 mg/ml PMSF). The crude plant extract was clarified by centrifugation at 17,700\u00d7g for 30 min at 4\u00b0C. pHu-E16 variants in clarified protein extract were purified by a two-step purification process comprised of ammonium sulfate precipitation and protein A affinity chromatography.",

Gels were stained with Coomassie blue or used to transfer proteins onto PVDF membranes. Horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated antibodies against human-kappa LC or gamma HC (Southern Biotech) were used for western blot analysis as previously described [11]. pHu-E16 variant expression and antigen binding was examined with an ELISA as described [11]. Briefly, DIII (amino acids 296-415) of the New York 1999 strain of WNV purified from E. coli\n[46], [47] was immobilized on microtiter plates. After incubation with plant protein extract or purified pHu-E16 variants, an HRP-conjugated anti-human-gamma HC antibody (Southern Biotech) was used as the detection antibody. The plates were developed with TMB substrate (KPL Inc). mHu-E16 [25] and pHu-E16 [11] were used as reference standards. Since this ELISA measured the quantity of HC, it provided a molar equivalent of each pHu-E16 variant to pHu-16 rather than their yield in mass. Thus, the yield (\u03bcg/g LFW) of each variant was calculated by the formula: (ELISA HC equivalent value)/ (molecular weight of pHu-E16 (150 kDa)) X (molecular weight of the variant) (125 kDa for the pHu-E16scFv-CH\n1-3, 170 kDa for pHu-E16scFv-CH\n1-3/LC, 175 kDa for HC/pHu-E16scFv-CL and 200 kDa for tetra pHu-E16). Yeast displaying WNV DIII on their surface were generated, stained with MAb variants, and analyzed with a Becton Dickinson FACSCalibur flow cytometer as described [11], [25].",
