Then, the clinical evolution was favorable with no complications and no deaths among these patients. Early healthcare with appropriate training of healthcare works would be critical to keeping mostly this in a similar trend for future cases in the country that is now taken severe actions, such as home isolation and quarantine [[51], [52], [53], [54]], primarily to protect those with risk factors.

There is an urgent need to train most of the healthcare workforce on biosecurity, isolation, and quarantine, in order to be massively applied in the country. If these measures are implemented soon, more possibilities to control spreading will have the countries, which is even critical in countries, such as Bolivia, with limited resources.",

In the case of Bolivia, the less developed nation of South America, national and international cooperation, advise and support, lead to enhance surveillance and early case detection of COVID-19, scaling up the training activities at the healthcare sector and the community for proper education as well as quarantine. In this report, the first 12 confirmed cases were analyzed, showing that most of the evolve positively with no severe disease nor fatalities. Nevertheless, preparedness for a significant epidemic, as is going on in other countries, and the deployment of response plans for it, in the country is now taking place to mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic in the population.",

Also, there is a need for improvement of the volume of personnel trained to run such tests, and to warrant an adequate stock of materials needed to do them. Health authorities should train, equip, and strengthen the diagnostic capacities of hospital laboratories close to infectious disease and emergency departments to reduce the time to deliver results, manage confirmed cases and contacts more rapidly, and preserve strict infection control measures [25]. Finally, in the differential diagnosis with other febrile conditions, especially in Latin America, also coinfections with dengue [75] and with respiratory viruses, such as Influenza and Metapneumovirus [[80], [81], [82]], among others, already reported together with SARS-CoV-2, should be considered.",

Third, due to constraining in the use of the rRT-PCR, only initial testing was provided, although after ceased of symptoms, for the case hospitalized, it will be repeated to assess if became negative. More comprehensive contact tracing for these cases should be performed to assess the possibility of community transmission. Finally, soon, Bolivia will also need to have sequencing and phylogenetic studies that would be useful as this may diverge from other SARS-CoV-2 isolates or strain, that even, would be related to clinical evolution and outcomes.",
