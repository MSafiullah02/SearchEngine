Accordingly, a broad audience has been made aware in recent years of the characteristics of a typical trafficking pathway for many targeted therapeutics. Such a pathway is characterized by: receptor binding followed by cell entry via receptor-mediated endocytosis into clathrin-coated pits and vesicles, delivery to early endosomes, and passage through late endosomes/lysosomes where cargo degradation otherwise takes place [1], [2], [3]. Ligand\u2013receptor pairs, viruses and other pathogens, as well as non-viral gene delivery vectors are known to enter cells by such routes. If a targeted therapeutic, such as a gene delivery vector, is to impart therapeutic efficacy, however, the degradative pathway must somehow be avoided.",

Such pathways may offer alternative uptake and trafficking routes for gene delivery vectors and targeted therapeutics that may avoid the barriers posed by the classical route. For example, the retrograde transport pathway, used by plant and bacterial toxins, facilitates endocytic trafficking from the cell surface to the Golgi, and from the Golgi to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), in reverse of classical secretion [4], [5] (Fig. 1\n). These toxins can then make use of the cell's own protein auditing system to become transported to the cytoplasm where the toxic activity can take place.",

The appeal of using viruses or viral components in targeted therapeutics is partly due to the capacity of endosomal escape, and thus avoidance of lysosomal degradation, by penetrating the membrane of the maturing vesicle before cargo delivery to the lysosome. Peptides derived from several types of pathogens have been used to accomplish the same [10]. Such peptides are thought to change conformation in response to the acidifying environment of the endosomal lumen and as a result, interact with the endosomal membrane by forming pores or destabilizing the lipid bilayer, thus affording vesicle escape.",

PEx contains a KDEL-like sequence that is exposed after A chain release by furin cleavage in early/recycling endosomes [28], [36], [37], [38], [39]. The lipid-sorted pathway, used by STx, is both KDEL receptor and COP1-independent, and controlled by Rab6 [40], [41], [42], [43]. PEx may also use this pathway [28]. A third poorly characterized pathway bypasses the Golgi cisternae and instead transports cargo directly from the TGN to the ER in a KDEL receptor and COP1-independent manner. CTx uses this pathway, despite the existence of a KDEL motif in its peptide sequence [44]. It is possible that this motif functions to retain CTx in the ER after delivery, and prevent possible anterograde transport to the Golgi.",

Gene delivery conjugates have also been produced and tested that make use of components from toxins, like PEx, that undergo retrograde trafficking.

This approach to generating a new type of vaccine has been used to deliver epitopes via PEx [61], STx [62], and other types of toxins [14]. As the molecular players of the toxin/retrograde trafficking pathway are better characterized, it may be possible to utilize this route as a means to target compounds to the other specific organelles contributing to this pathway. One could envisage the design of new molecules that can interact with target cells similarly to the toxins discussed here, and mimic the toxin trafficking pathway to deliver peptides specifically to the Golgi or ER to, perhaps, correct a defect, or elicit toxicity for the treatment of cancer. Moreover, given its avoidance of the lysosome, perhaps this route could be of better use for gene delivery and enable greater survival of gene therapy vectors after target cell entry.",

PrPc can constitutively endocytose via either clathrin-coated vesicles or caveolae (Fig. 2), likely depending on cell type or lipid microenvironment [74]. Once internalized, PrPc traffics through late endosomes/lysosomes, with a steady state fraction localized to multivesicular bodies (MVBs) in neurons, brain, and non-neuronal cells [76], [77], [78]. MVBs are formed by the pinching off of cytosol-filled, or intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) into the endosomal lumen [79], [80] (Fig. 2). The sorting of cargo into ILVs involves at least 18 proteins and is a tightly regulated process [81]. Among the cellular factors contributing to this process is the Endosomal Sorting Complex Required for Transport (ESCRT) machinery, which are cytosolic proteins that selectively sort cargo to ILVs [81]. In this process, ubiquitinated cargo proteins are recognized by Hrs complex (or ESCRT-0) proteins, which then recruit Tsg101 and the ESCRT-I complex, that also recognize ubiquitinated cargo. Tsg101 then recruits ESCRT-III via ESCRT-II or Alix, which together sequester cargo proteins into the inward-budding ILVs.",

Both PrPsc and PrPc have been detected in cell culture supernatants, associated with secreted exosomes [9]. These exosomes elicited conversion of endogenous PrPc to PrPsc when incubated with na\u00efve host cells [72], and caused acute typical neuropathology when inoculated into mice [9].

Transfer of the protein to recipient cells is thought to take place by interaction of exosomes with recipient cell membranes through two possible types of mechanisms (Fig. 2). One mechanism is the direct fusion of exosomes with the plasma membrane, thus transferring contents of exosomal membranes to the plasma membrane. This has been suggested by the observation that recipient cells receive incoming PrPsc into recipient raft domains, and exchange of membrane components can take place between exosomes and recipient cells [83]. A more likely mechanism, however, is that exosomes undergo endocytic uptake into recipient cells, then back-fuse with the limiting membrane of the endocytic vesicle, thus transferring exosomal membrane contents. Exosomal delivery of transconformation activity is supported by this mechanism, as the conversion process is thought to occur at low pH [84], [85].",

            "text": "Gene therapy treatment of solid tumors relies on efficient delivery to as many cells as possible to obtain the most potent level of gene expression and potential tumor ablation. However, delivery of a gene to 100% of cells in a tumor may be an improbable task. Expression of a gene product that can somehow spread a therapeutic effect to neighboring cells is a more feasible approach. Thus, the use of the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase (HSV-TK) gene as a therapeutic transgene has sustained great appeal in gene therapy due to the \u2018bystander effect\u2019 caused by the toxic enzyme product [86]. This effect describes the ability of the HSV-TK enzyme product, triphosphorylated ganciclovir, to spread to neighboring cells via gap junctions within the solid tumor, whereas the substrate has no such effect on cells. More recently, attempts have been made to enhance this effect by producing TK as a recombinant fusion to the VP22 protein [87], which has an ability to become secreted from the expressing cell and taken up by neighboring cells through a mechanism that remains unclear [88], [89]. The capacity of secreted exosomes from a \u2018producer\u2019 cell to be taken up by neighboring as well as remote cell targets could be a potent means of delivering the most efficient levels of a therapeutic to cell targets. One could envisage the ability to modify such exosomes with a membrane bound targeting ligand to perhaps limit the spread of a therapeutic to surrounding tumor tissue while at the same time target remote, metastatic tumors. Such modified exosomes containing a therapeutic protein or compound could efficiently deliver the therapy into recipient cells by fusion of the exosomal membrane with recipient cell membranes, thus releasing the product directly into the target cells. Further characterization of the pathogenic and cellular factors contributing to this process would determine whether this approach to therapeutic dissemination could be a feasible option in the future.",

Binding also induces a cascade of signaling events, including tyrosine kinase phosphorylation and protein kinase C activation [101], [109], which contribute to caveolar formation and endocytosis. One downstream effect of signaling is actin depolymerization, which facilitates caveolar internalization, and recruitment of dynamin-2 to pinch off the caveolar neck and release caveolar vesicles [104], which some have termed \u2018cavicles\u2019 [110].

In non-infected cells, these compartments are likely to serve as intermediate depots for transport of sphingolipids and GPI-linked proteins from the plasma membrane to the Golgi apparatus [112], [113].

In an alternative and more rapid endocytic pathway, SV40 may be directly internalized via lipid rafts in a dynamin-2-independent manner and vesiculate into Cav1-negative organelles [102].

Expression of Cav1 in cells lacking caveolae is sufficient to generate caveolar formation [118], whereas overexpression of Cav1 can inhibit this [119]. It has been proposed that Cav1 stabilizes caveolar invaginations whereas Cav1-negative intermediates can rapidly bud from the cell membrane and endocytose [115]. This may partly explain findings using green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged Cav1 showing that a large pool of immobile caveolin exists in cultured cells [120]. Such reports in addition to the SV40 trafficking pathway have suggested that caveolae mediate slow (up to 1\u20132h) endocytosis that requires sequestration of cargo at the cell surface before internalization [101]. This contrasts with the rapid endothelial transcytosis mediated by caveolae in vivo that has been observed using specific targeted nanoparticles [121]. These studies demonstrated that in vivo circulating particles targeted to caveolae rapidly crossed the endothelium and underlying basement membrane, and accumulated into the interstitial space at lung tissues within minutes. The contrasting findings of the latter and former studies may depend on whether the studies are being performed in vivo or in cultured cells, as well as the type of probe being used.",

Given that cellular proteins, such as transforming growth factor \u03b2 receptor (TGF\u03b2-R), elicit receptor signaling when internalized via clathrin-coated pits whereas caveosome uptake promotes receptor turnover [114], it appears that using caveosomes as a means to evade degradation would depend on modulation by the vesicle cargo itself.

Accumulating studies on vector trafficking do not show, however, that one route consistently supports gene transfer. For example, recent studies have shown that certain polyplexes entered cultured cells by both clathrin and caveolar-mediated pathways, yet the latter pathway preferentially led to gene expression whereas inhibition of the former pathway had no effect [125].

While BCV can acquire LAMP-1, it is argued that other compartments in addition to late endosomes/lysosomes can harbor the LAMP-1 marker [137]. As the BCV vacuole matures, it undergoes acidification [138], and comes in close contact with the ER [129] (Fig. 4). The BCV interacts with the ER and forms an ER-derived replicative organelle, establishing long-term survival (Fig. 4). In epithelial cells, the replicative organelle is ER-derived, whereas in phagocytic cells, BCVs dock at the ER and acquire ER-specific markers via limited fusion events [129]. At this stage, the organelle becomes permissive for bacterial replication. Requirement for additional membrane output for replication is likely provided by further fusion interactions with the ER membrane. Studies on L. pneumophila show that biogenesis of the ER-derived organelle requires interception of COPI vesicular trafficking from the ER [139]. This is not true for Brucella, however, as blocking such trafficking has no effect on BCV maturation or replication [129].",

The screening of Brucella survival mutants generated by transposon insertion identified the VirB operon [140], which encodes a type IV-related secretion system that typically secretes/exports nucleoprotein complexes or proteins [129], [141]. In contrast to wild-type Brucella, the VirB mutants undergo lipid raft-independent endocytosis, remain in immature vacuoles, can dock with the ER but do not sustain fusion with the ER, and are ultimately targeted to the degradative pathway (thus failing to reach a replicative niche). The relevance of VirB in endocytic entry is unclear, as a minority of ingested wild-type bacteria survive in the host cell, suggesting that the majority of internalized bacteria do not escape the degradative pathway [129], [142], [143]. Furthermore, studies in B. suis show that VirB expression takes place after cell entry [144]. VirB is likely involved in late events corresponding with ER fusion [129]. It is possible that VirB mediates the transport of bacterial effector molecules into the host cell that may modulate BCV maturation.",

            "text": "Gene therapy may be administered as a temporary, short-term treatment for a disease, such as cancer, or as a long-term or permanent solution to replace or correct a defective gene. Long-term approaches have typically entailed the use of a viral vector with the capacity to integrate a gene of interest into the host genome, which can pose serious concerns, including the possibility that gene insertion can activate an oncogenic effect [145], [146], [147]. Alternatively, DNA vectors containing elements for extrachromosomal retention in host cells may support a long-term, though not permanent, solution for transgene delivery [148]. In the same vein, perhaps an extranuclear organelle, such as the type of vacuole providing a haven for pathogens like Brucella, may enable the long-term residence and retention of a gene therapy vector or drug in a target cell. Bacterial-like vectors have been considered for cancer therapy and gene therapy [149], [150], [151]. While the mechanism for the formation of pathogen-containing vacuoles and replicative organelles needs further characterization, studies so far appear to suggest that these intracellular bodies occur as a result of interaction between pathogen gene products and host cell factors. Further studies identifying the players in these interactions and associated functions may direct future efforts to design molecules that can mimic these dynamics and induce the formation of similar intracellular organelles. One could envisage such organelles as being useful in the long-term intracellular retention of therapeutic compounds or genes, whose release over time could be of more benefit in comparison to large, potentially toxic, bolus doses of therapeutic that may require numerous repeat doses to be effective.",

While the typical clathrin-mediated endocytic pathway used by many gene therapy vectors and targeted therapeutics introduces common cellular barriers, alternative pathways such as those discussed here may provide a means to evade such barriers. Moreover, such pathways may facilitate delivery to specific organelles and cellular compartments. Future studies on the molecular mechanisms mediating pathogen trafficking through these pathways may enable design of new vectors and delivery agents with improved ability to direct therapy to desired intracellular targets.",

Alternatively, transport may take place directly from the TGN to the ER. The toxin is displaced from the ER through a pore into the cytoplasm where the translation machinery can be accessed.",

Prion protein (PrP) may undergo either clathrin or caveolae-mediated endocytosis into early/sorting endosomes which can sort to multivesicular bodies (MVBs), into which intraluminal vesicles (ILVs) containing cytosolic material bud off into the endosomal lumen. ILV formation results in GPI-attached proteins remaining anchored at the outer surface of the ILV. MVBs can fuse with either lysosomes or with the plasma membrane, releasing the ILVs from the cell surface, which are now known as exosomes. Exosomes can either directly fuse with the plasma membrane of an uninfected cell (shown in green) or undergo endocytic uptake. Direct fusion may result in delivery of PrP to the membrane of endosomal vesicles, which may undergo ILV budding and result in the location of PrP on the ILV outer surface. Alternatively, endocytosed exosomes may undergo back-fusion with the endosomal limiting membrane, resulting in PrP localizing to the endosomal membrane.",
