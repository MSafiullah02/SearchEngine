According to the regulations for ARTI management in China, all patients with acute fever must be screened at this department before they are assigned to a specific medical department in a hospital. The criteria of the patients enrolled in this study were as follows to include suspected viral ARTIs: \u226514 years of age, acute fever (\u226538\u00b0C), respiratory symptoms such as cough or wheezing, and normal or low leukocyte count [21]. One nasal swab and one throat swab were taken from each patient upon the first visit and were put into a vial of viral transport medium (VTM; Copan, Brescia, Italy). Rrespiratory specimens were obtained from a total of 7,776 patients with ARTIs from May 2006 through May 2010, 259 (3.3%) patients had lower ARTIs (LRTIs, e.g. pneumonia) and 7,517 (96.7%) had upper ARTIs (URTIs, e.g. rhinitis, pharyngitis, or laryngitis). Patients\u2019 ages ranged from 14 to 97 years (mean: 35.1 years, median: 30.0 years). The study included 3,559 male (45.8%) and 4,217 female (54.2%) patients (Table 1). The specimens were stored at \u221280\u00b0C prior to use. Part of these specimens had been used for etiological and epidemiological investigations on viral ARTIs within different time interval (some data unpublished) [21]\u2013[26]. All specimens used in this study were obtained with written informed consent from all participants or guardians on behalf of the minors/children participants and were coded prior to analysis to ensure anonymity. This study was approved by the Medical Ethic Review Board of the Institute of Pathogen Biology, Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (Beijing, China).",

A prior H3N2 epidemic and a subsequent peak of influenza B were identified with the A/H1N1 2009pdm epidemic (Figure 2 and 3), which is consistent with the results of a previous influenza epidemic in children, in China [32]. However this finding differs from the patterns observed in Shenzhen, China, where epidemics of H3N2 and A/H1N1 2009pdm occurred from May to December 2009 and formed a big epidemic peak [33] and in Hong Kong, China, where the epidemics of H3N2 and A/H1N1 2009pdm occurred simultaneously between May and August 2009 [34]. This epidemic pattern is also different from those observed in USA and European countries [6], [7], [11], [35], where epidemics of H3N2 in summer and influenza B in winter did not occur in 2009. Moreover, compared to nationwide surveillance data from the CNIC, the epidemic peak of influenza in Beijing was higher and appeared 4 weeks earlier than peaks in mainland China (Figure 2). One possible explanation for this observation is that Beijing is a city with dense population in which person-to-person interactions, including interactions with other areas and countries, occur more frequently.",

The reasons for this predominance and its influence on A/H1N1 2009pdm are unclear. It is possible that the summer epidemic of H3N2 hampered the outbreak of A/H1N1 2009pdm.

However, we did not detect such an HRV outbreak prior to the peak of A/H1N1 2009pdm (Figure 3). Meanwhile, in contrast to that observed in previous influenza seasons, A/H1N1 2009pdm did not obviously interfere with the epidemic of HRV and HRV had a relatively long prevalent period (week 40\u221253) during the epidemic of A/H1N1 2009pdm in the winter/spring, 2009\u22122010 (Figure 3), indicating that the influence of A/H1N1 2009pdm on the HRV epidemic may differ from that of seasonal influenza viruses. Potential interactions between HRV and influenza viruses could be implied by known biological mechanisms. The receptors of influenza viruses and HRV are sialic acid alpha 2\u20136 and human intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), respectively [36], [37]. Viruses do not bind the same receptor in cells, thus, the epidemics of HRV and A/H1N1 2009pdm could exist simultaneously. Our finding that 12.8% HRV cases co-infected with A/H1N1 2009pdm in winter/spring 2009\u22122010 also suggests this point. The A/H1N1 2009pdm outbreak may have been delayed by the summer epidemic of H3N2 in 2009, in Beijing, because of H3N2 using the same receptors, sialic acid alpha 2\u20136, as A/H1N1 2009pdm. However, further studies are required to explain the phenomenon that the seasonal influenza viruses H3N2 and H1N1 were not prevalent simultaneously with HRV in 2006\u22122009.",

However, we observed different clinical manifestations between infections of A/H1N1 2009pdm and seasonal influenza viruses as well as non-influenza respiratory viruses. We found that A/H1N1 2009pdm infection primarily causes cough, whereas seasonal influenza and other respiratory viruses primarily cause chills and muscle pain, which is consistent with other reports [38], [39].",
