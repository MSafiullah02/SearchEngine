The incidence of emergencies in otorhinolaryngology, head and neck surgery such as foreign bodies in the esophagus and the respiratory tract, epistaxis, laryngeal obstruction with dyspnea, and head and neck trauma are relatively high.

[1, 2] At present, the transmission mechanism of the SARS-CoV-2 has not been fully understood, and respiratory droplets and contact transmission are the major transmission paths. [3] It has also been reported that viruses could be detected in the patients' feces. [4] Transmission paths such as aerosol and digestive duct transmission are under investigation. The population is generally susceptible. The prognosis of the elderly and those with chronic diseases is poor while infants and children could also be infected, but with relatively mild symptoms. According to current epidemiological investigation, the incubation period of the SARS-CoV-2 is between 1 to 14 days, and is usually between 3 to 7 days. The primary manifestations are fever, lack of energy and dry cough, a small number of patients have accompanying symptoms such as nasal congestion, nasal discharge, diarrhea, etc. Most of the severe patients developed to dyspnea and/or hypoxemia after 1 week of onset, and some of the severe cases progressed rapidly to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), septic shock, difficult to correct metabolic acidosis and coagulopathy. [1] The upper airway of the nasopharynx is in communication with the outside world, which is the main path of respiratory tract transmission. The incubation period of SARS-CoV-2 is relatively long, and some patients at the early infected stage often go to the outpatient of otorhinolaryngology, head and neck surgery for the treatment. The management of infection control and diagnosis and treatment in outpatient and emergency department could refer to \"To the National Otorhinolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery Medical Personnel -Several Protective Suggestions in the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia\" issued by Chinese Medical Association of Otorhinolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgeryand \" Occupational infection prevention and Control Recommendations of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia for Otorhinolaryngology Head and Neck Surgery Medical Personnel\" issued by Chinese Medical Doctor Association of Otorhinolaryngology, Head and Neck Surgery.",

According to current cases analysis, retention of lower respiratory tract secretions of COVID-19 is not serious. [10] The mortality of critically ill patients with COVID-19 is very high and the survival time of the non-survivors is within 1 to 2 weeks after ICU admission. [11] These indicate that tracheotomy does not increase the benefits of invasive mechanical ventilation. Therefore, neither we nor the respiratory physicians recommend tracheotomy (including percutaneous gas resection) for severe COVID-19 patientsat the first 3 weeks. [12] If tracheotomy is necessary, tracheal endocrine secretion should also be prevented when performing bedside surgery in an isolation ward. The ventilator should be suspended before opening the tracheal ring and ventilating airbag and the wound should be completely hemostatic. When dealing with massive epistaxis, care should be taken to avoid blood spraying and nasal packing made from absorbable materials are recommended to reduce or avoid postoperative dressing changes.

The hospitals that are able to perform surgery for patients with SARS-CoV-2 should open emergency channel for patients who suffer from quickly life-threatening emergency such as laryngeal obstruction with dyspnea (level 3 or higher), massive persistent epistaxis with hemorrhagic shock, severe head and neck trauma and children foreign respiratory tract and all cases need to be treated as confirmed cases. Patients who need surgery because of foreign body in the esophagus and other emergency that are not quickly endanger life, should strictly follow the procedures and strengthen infection control in all aspects including patient admission, preoperative care, intraoperative management, and postoperative management. Tracheotomy is not recommended as it does not increase the benefits of invasive mechanical ventilation at the first 3 weeks. Recommendations for otorhinolaryngology, head and neck surgery emergency surgery is to improve the success rate of treatment for otorhinolaryngology, head and neck surgery emergency surgeries and to reduce the novel coronavirus infection rate in the perioperative period. With the deepening of the understanding of SARS-CoV-2 and the continuous improvement of the diagnosis and treatment plan, recommendations for diagnosis and treatment of emergency surgery in otorhinolaryngology, head and neck surgeryin novel coronavirus pneumonia situation will be further updated and improved.",
