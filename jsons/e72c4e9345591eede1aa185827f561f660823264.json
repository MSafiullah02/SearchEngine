Hantaviruses, like other members of the Bunyaviridae family, have previously not been shown to be sensitive to RNI. In this study, we compared the effects of NO and peroxynitrite on hantavirus replication and free mature virions in vitro, and of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in hantavirusinfected suckling mice. The NO-generating compound S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine (SNAP), as well as cytokine-induced NO, strongly inhibited hantavirus replication in Vero E6 cells, while pretreatment of free virions with SNAP only had a limited effect on their viability. In contrast, 3-morpholinosydnonimine hydrochloride (SIN-1), a peroxynitrite donor, inhibited virus replication only to a very low extent in vitro, but pretreatment of virus with SIN-1 led to a considerably lowered viability of the virions. Infections of various human cell types per se did not induce NO production. The viral titers in iNOS -/mice were higher compared to the controls, suggesting that NO inhibits hantavirus replication in vivo. In conclusion, we show that NO has strong antiviral effects on hantavirus replication, and peryoxynitrite on mature free virions, suggesting that different RNI can have different effects on various parts of the replication cycle for the same virus.",

Hantaviruses, belonging to the Bunyaviridae family, have a negative sense tripartite RNA genome encoding four structural proteins: the nucleocapsid (N) protein, two glycoproteins, and an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase [1] . The natural hosts are rodents, and the virus is transmitted to humans via inhaled contaminated rodent excreta. In contrast to human infections, the natural rodent hosts do not show any symptoms after infection [2] . The pathogenesis in man is only poorly understood, but immune-mediated mechanisms have been suggested [3, 4] .",

Similarly, L-NMMA or D-NMMA had no clear effect on the viral titers from cells stimulated by IFN-c (approximately 5% more viruses in D-NMMA + IFN-c-treated cells compared to L-NMMA + IFN-c-treated cells), showing that the inhibition of virus replication by IFN-c alone is NO independent.

NO will also react with O 2 in the medium and form peroxynitrite. And although most of the NO and O 2 produced by SIN-1 will immediately form peroxynitrite, some NO will be produced that might not react with O 2 -. Superoxide can also form hydrogen peroxide, which in turn can form hypochlorus acid and other oxidants. These reactive nitrogen intermediates and reactive oxygen intermediates can penetrate cellular membranes and react with pathogen targets. Thus, the effect we have observed might be even more polarized, as some of the effect of SNAP observed on viable free virions might be explained by the formation of small amounts of peroxynitrite and other nitrogen intermediates, and the minor antiviral effect of SIN-1 observed on hantavirus replication in vitro might partly be explained by the production of NO and other intermediates.",

The levels of nitrate/nitrite observed in patients indicate the accumulated levels of NO and/or peroxynitrite, but say little about the concentration of them at a certain time point. It is therefore not possible to state that the amount of NO and peroxynitrite formed in vitro by SNAP and SIN-1, respectively, and shown to be antiviral against hantaviruses, are physiologically relevant. However, the finding that iNOS -/suckling mice had higher levels of replicating virus than controls is in line with the finding that cytokine-stimulated NO production inhibited hantavirus replication in Vero E6 cells. Furthermore, Davis and coworkers recently reported clearly elevated levels of nitrate/nitrite in HCPS patients [15] , and Groeneveld and coworkers showed the same for HFRS patients [16] . Thus, our results suggest that the levels of NO and peroxynitrite formed in patients might reduce hantavirus replication and/or damage free virions.",

The finding that pretreatment of cells with SNAP was not needed for inhibition of the virus replication suggests that S-nitrosylation of host cellular proteins is not instrumental for NO-mediated inhibition of hantavirus replication. Furthermore, it seems likely that NO and peroxynitrite have different targets, as they only show a minor overlap in their potential to interfere with replication and to inactivate free virions. iNOS is the major source of NO during virus infection. There are two pathways for iNOS induction during infections: direct up-regulation by the virus or indirect up-regulation via cytokine-dependent mechanisms [10] . Direct up-regulation by virus has been shown for respiratory syncytial virus, human immunodeficiency virus, and hepatitis C virus infection [26] [27] [28] [29] . The exact mechanism(s) leading to elevated levels of RNI during human hantavirus infection are currently not known, but the finding that infection of cells in vitro did not induce detectable levels of nitrite suggests that RNI are produced as a response to the elevated levels of cytokines, like TNF-a and IFN-c, detected in patients [3] .",

We previously showed that DOBV, but not SAAV, was lethal for suckling mice and that increased levels of NO production were detected in lethally infected mice [13] . Furthermore, we also observed replicating virus in SAAV-inoculated mice 34 days after infection, whereas mice that survived DOBV infection had no replicating viruses in the brain [13] . Together with the finding that iNOS -/suckling mice showed higher titers of replicating virus in the brain compared to normal C57BL/6 mice and that both strains showed severe symptoms at the same day after infection, the results might indicate that NO, at least in mice, is more likely to be involved in viral clearance than in pathogenesis.",

Supernatant samples, and sodium nitrite as standard, were mixed with equal volumes of Griess reagents (1% sulfanilamide and 0.1% naphtylethylenediamide, in 5% phosphoric acid), and the optical density at 540 nm was measured by spectrophotometry.
