Although anti-influenza drugs and vaccines are available, due to the continuous antigenic variations (in the form of drifts and shifts), this virus can lead to yearly epidemics and occasional pandemics; hence influenza remains a global threat. The next common virus associated with significant hospitalization and respiratory distress, particularly in children, is the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Nearly 70% of children are infected with RSV by the age of 1 year (4). Other common viruses are parainfluenza viruses, coronaviruses, human metapneumovirus, measles, adenoviruses and bocavirus. Identification of these respiratory viruses is not given high priority as they mostly cause self-limiting disease and no specific antiviral drugs are available (except for influenza and RSV). However, the knowledge about prevalence of non-influenza viruses, their seasonal pattern and genetic evolution have significant epidemiological value.",

Generally, the impact of pandemic influenza in this region was relatively lower when compared to many Indian and foreign states (21) (22) (23) (24) .

Worldwide, RSV predominance in children has been reported (26) and the same scenario exists in India. RSV is known to co-infect with HMPV and influenza viruses; we observed 3 mixed RSV infections, but no clinical correlation could be made due to the low frequency of the same. After the first Indian report of HMPV appeared in 2004 (27), many studies from Lucknow, Vellore and New Delhi have identified it as the second most common cause of ILI in children, next only to RSV (1, 28, 29) . In this study, the prevalence of human metapneumovirus (HMPV) was 3.7%; the predominant group affected was age 14-30 years.

Viral ARI is initiated with mild respiratory symptoms which are likely to be neglected in the first three to five days; during when the maximum virus shedding occurs. This has been well demonstrated in the pathogenesis of influenza and RSV infection (39, 40) and it is emphasized to collect samples in the first 3 days of symptoms onset. This study finding also suggests the importance of sample collection within 3 days of symptoms onset to achieve the maximum viral detection rate. Apart from the timing, the other important aspect of sample collection is the type of sample collected. In this study, we used nasopharyngeal sample collected using flocked nylon swabs, which have been shown to have excellent sensitivity when compared to rayon swabs, and is considered as an alternative to nasopharyngeal aspirate sampling (41, 42) .",

In our study from the southern part of India, the maximum ARI cases were recorded during the months between August and December, except in 2012 and 2015. In both these years, a surge of suspected ARI cases was observed during the early months of these years, due to the outbreak of influenza A(H1N1)pdm09. As described in our earlier studies, both these outbreaks occurred during high mean maximum temperature period of these years and we found no correlation with rainfall (11).",
