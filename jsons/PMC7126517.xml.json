Photocatalysis using TiO2 is effective in the elimination of toxic substances in water and air [17], [18], [19]. The photocatalysis of TiO2 combined with other metals or ions has been investigated and developed, and combined photocatalysts have been shown to have stronger photocatalytic, antiviral and antibacterial activities compared with those of TiO2 alone [15], [20]. Therefore, a photocatalytic reaction by TiO2 alone or in combination with a metal or ion is an attractive approach and could be applied to the elimination of bacteria, viruses, and toxic substances.",

In contrast, the reduction of infection risk by droplet and airborne transmission pathways using a photocatalytic reaction has not been investigated thoroughly. Recently, we developed TiO2-coated cordierite foam for use in air cleaners [23]. This TiO2-coated cordierite foam has antibacterial activity and achieves the photocatalytic degradation of acetaldehyde. Furthermore, we developed a reliable methodology to confirm the antibacterial properties of TiO2-coated cordierite foam [23]. Therefore, we have been able to show that use of TiO2-coated cordierite foam in air cleaners reduces the risk of bacterial infection by airborne transmission. However, there are no experimental data to support the antiviral activity of TiO2-coated cordierite foam.",

Furthermore, copper ion deposited on TiO2 enhances the photocatalytic activity [15], [20]. Antibacterial activity by a combination of Cu and TiO2 has been reported [20], [26], [27]. Sunada et al. [27] have shown that the first stage of bacterial inactivation under weak UV exposure is outer membrane degradation by photocatalytic reaction with Cu2+ ions infiltrating the cells as the second step. Furthermore, Cu2+/TiO2 shows strong decomposition of acetaldehyde [28]. The suggested photocatalytic reaction process is shown as in Fig. 1\n[29]. Deposited Cu2+ works as an electron acceptor. Thus, enhanced photocatalytic reaction by deposited Cu2+ is beneficial for removal of many organic pollutants.",

We have confirmed a Ti phase in TiO2-coated cordierite foam in our previous study [23].

Although we tried to analyze using X-ray diffraction analysis, it was impossible to detect Cu2+ because it was present in low amounts on the filter.

Q\u03b2 and T4 bacteriophage (on bare cordierite foam) with or without UV irradiation had no inactivation ratio (white and black diamonds). The bare cordierite foam loaded with Cu2+ only also had no inactivation ratio for both bacteriophages with or without UV irradiation (white triangle and black diamond). TiO2-coated cordierite foam with UV irradiation had an effective time-dependent inactivation ratio for both bacteriophages (black triangles). The inactivation ratio differed between the Q\u03b2 and T4 bacteriophages. At 4 h, the infectious activity of Q\u03b2 bacteriophage could not be detected, while that of T4 phage could be. Cu2+/TiO2-coated cordierite foam under UV irradiation also inactivated both bacteriophages (black squares). In particular, greater bacteriophage inactivation was observed than that with TiO2-coated cordierite foam under UV irradiation. The Q\u03b2 bacteriophages were inactivated to an undetectable level after 2 h irradiation. The T4 bacteriophages were also inactivated to an undetectable level after 4 h irradiation. Using TiO2-coated and Cu2+/TiO2-coated cordierite foam under UV irradiation, the inactivation ratio of the T4 bacteriophages was less than that of the Q\u03b2 bacteriophages. We suggest that differences in size and structure between the two bacteriophages were responsible for this difference. Supporting our suggestion, experiments in bacteriophage inactivation using thin films have revealed differences in inactivation ratio between these two bacteriophages [9]. Therefore, photocatalytic inactivation by Cu2+/TiO2-coated cordierite foam also depends on the size and structure of the target bacteriophage.",

When the inactivation ratio was compared between UV irradiation at 0.1 and 0.25 mW cm\u22122 for 4 h, a difference in inactivation by TiO2-coated cordierite foam was observed. The infection activity of Q\u03b2 bacteriophages on TiO2-coated cordierite foam could be detected after UV irradiation at 0.1 mW cm\u22122 but not after UV irradiation at 0.25 mW cm\u22122. In contrast, the infection activity of Q\u03b2 bacteriophages on Cu2+/TiO2-coated cordierite foam could not be detected after UV irradiation at 0.1 mW cm\u22122 for 4 h. However, we also tested the difference between the amounts of 250 \u03bcM and 25 mM Cu2+, but there were no differences between them (Fig. 7\n). This suggested that the deposited range from 1 to 10 wt% Cu2+ was sufficient to inactivate the viruses. Thus, photocatalytic reaction by the deposited Cu2+ has a stronger photocatalytic activation, and therefore, viruses could be inactivated more effectively compared with TiO2-coated cordierite foam.",
