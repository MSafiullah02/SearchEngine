Metagenomics sequencing analysis revealed a novel coronavirus, which was officially named SARS-CoV-2 and is the cause of the disease named COVID-19 (World health Organization, 2020). The National Health Commission (NHC) set COVID-19 as a category B infectious disease with A-class management on Jan 20 (The Central Government of the People\u2019s Republic of China, 2020). Furthermore, on Jan 30, the WHO issued a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) alarm and appealed all specialists over the world working together to control the rapid spread of COVID-19. As of Mar 8, there had been 80,859 confirmed patients of COVID-19 in China, including 3,100 deaths. Internationally, over 100 countries have now reported laboratory-confirmed cases, including a total of 24,031 cases (World Health Organization, 2020).",

Most of them had been directly exposed to the Wuhan seafood wholesale market, which sells freshly slaughtered game animals, that were the original infection source (Huang et al., 2020). The present data strongly suggest that game animals or mammals were probably intermediate hosts of SARS-CoV-2 that originated from the Chinese horseshoe bat (Zhou et al., 2020, Lu et al., 2020). In addition, the virus has preferential tropism to human airway epithelial cells through the same cellular receptor as that for SARS, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2(ACE2), which is a central body receptor for the surface glycoprotein S of the virus (Munster et al., 2020). The way to ascertain disease depends on positive real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction(rRT-PCR) results for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid, and the associated mortality rates are 2-3% (World Health Organization, 2020, Chen et al., 2020). Currently, there are no definite antiviral therapies or vaccines for COVID-19, although some drugs are under investigation.",

Obviously, the total number of cases and transmission events have far exceeded those of SARS and H1N1. Wu et al. (2020) found that the mean R0 of COVID-19 was approximately 2.68(95% CI: 2.47-2.86). An increasing number of outbreaks of familial transmission stressed the possibility of person-to-person transmission (Chan et al., 2020, Rothe et al., 2020, Phan et al., 2020). The measures in which public health officials quarantine confirmed cases and isolate intimate patients are significant progress in responding to COVID-19 control. Another question for consideration is a group of asymptomatically infected individuals, which may propagate the virus and impede infection control (Zhou et al., 2020, Zhang et al., 2020). Bai et al. (2020) presented clinical data showing a familial cluster of 5 patients with COVID-19 and 1 asymptomatic family member, which presumed the possibility of infection from asymptomatic carriers.",

Because of the limits on access, Case 1 could not leave her hometown in the countryside, where there had been no previous reports of COVID-19. Furthermore, she had not been in contact with any person returning from Wuhan (except Case 3/4/5). In particular, Case 1 did not present any symptoms until Feb 1. She became ill with fever, and non-productive cough, and she took drugs at that time. By the evening, Case 1 started feeling better and continued to enjoy the Spring Festival. However, two days later, a fever of 38.6 \u00b0C recurred, along with dizziness, non-productive cough, and shortness of breath. She was presented to the hospital by her son on Feb 4 (Figure 2). The laboratory examination revealed an increasing level of white blood cell count (12.4 \u00d7 109/L), neutrophil count(7.82 \u00d7 109/L), C-reactive protein level (189.2 mg/L) and a low lymphocyte count(0.84 \u00d7 109/L) and platelet count(88 \u00d7 109/L) (Table 1). CT images showed massive shadows of high density in the lungs (Figure 1). Case 1 developed severe pneumonia and was enrolled in the ICU as dyspnoea increased, with hypoxemia on day 2 of hospitalization.

At the onset, the symptoms are usually fever, cough, shortness of breath and pharyngalgia or diarrhea (National Health Commission of the People\u2019s Republic of China, 2020). The emblematic radiologic characteristic is ground-glass opacities in the lungs. Laboratory data present as lymphocytopenia, hypoxemia, thrombocytopenia, and even liver and kidney dysfunction in severe pneumonia patients (Huang et al., 2020). At present, verified patients are the primary sources of infection, while asymptomatic carriers can also be a source to propagate the outbreak.

It was certain that Case 2 through 5 had no abnormal symptoms before the outbreak of Case 1. Notably, COVID-19 is highly infectious, and may be transmitted by asymptomatic carriers during the incubation period. The timeline events suggest that Case 4 was the most likely initial infection source, as the time of the onset of symptoms and negative rRT-PCR results was relatively earlier than Case 3 and Case 5 (Figure 2). Case 2 was afebrile without any clinical signs, and his chest CT images showed no abnormalities on Feb 5 and Feb 15 (Figure 1), which also proved the existence of asymptomatic carriers. Our findings provide evidence that asymptomatic carriers can be a latent source of COVID-19 infection. As the spread of COVID-19 is aggravating worldwide, it is pressing to provide more meritorious information for an improved understanding of the transmission and precaution of COVID-19. Further studies on the mechanism in which asymptomatic carriers can acquire and transmit COVID-19 are warranted.",
