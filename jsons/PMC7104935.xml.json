Although the disease disappeared in mid-2003, its re-emergence cannot be excluded since SARS-like coronaviruses are zoonotic and exist in animal reservoirs (e.g., bats, raccoon dogs and palm civets), thus posing a potential risk for future epidemics [1], [2], [3]. SARS coronavirus is a large, enveloped, single-strand, positive-sense RNA virus. The viral genome is about 30 kbp, containing open reading frames that encode the polymerases required for viral RNA synthesis, while the remaining open reading frames encode structural proteins (i.e., spike, envelope, membrane and nucleocapsid) and accessory proteins.",

There are four antigenically-related but distinct DENV serotypes, such that infection with one serotype does not confer life-long immunity against the other serotypes. DENV infection causes dengue fever, and occasionally the more serious conditions of dengue hemorrhagic fever and dengue shock syndrome [4]. Antibody-dependent enhancement is thought to play a central role in dengue pathogenesis, with the risk of developing dengue hemorrhagic fever and/or dengue shock syndrome being greater in secondary infections with DENV-2 compared to other serotypes [5]. The different manifestations of dengue may also be attributed to DENV variants with varying degrees of virulence [6], while viral load is also a contributing factor in the development of potentially fatal complications [7]. In addition, being a highly prevalent serotype in tropical and subtropical regions worldwide, DENV-2 was selected for this study. Although several dengue candidate vaccines are undergoing clinical trials, there are currently no effective antiviral therapies which are urgently needed to control dengue.",

Flavonoids are a class of natural products with high pharmacological potency, are ubiquitous in photosynthesizing cells and hence likely to be consumed daily [15]. Flavonoids are known to display antiviral activities, e.g., glabranine and 7-O-methyl-glabranine against dengue virus, procyanidin and pelargonidin against HSV, and catechins against influenza virus [16], [17].",

They were also selected since they are common and naturally occurring flavonoids, whose molecular structures share high degrees of similarity.

C57/BL6 nulliparous and non-pregnant female mice about 8-weeks old were obtained from the Laboratory Animals Center, National University of Singapore. Upon arrival, they were kept in cages for 5 d prior to commencement of the study. On the actual dose-feeding day, the mice were fasted for about 4 h. Doses of 100, 500, 1 000 and 2 000 mg/kg were prepared for administration using water as vehicle to suspend the ethanolic extract of H. cordata at a constant volume of 1 mL/100 g of body weight. In total, the five groups of mice (n = 2 each) were fed with a single dose of the extract (including the vehicle control) by oral gavage. A sighting study was then conducted frequently from the first 30 min, with special attention to the first 4 h. Thereafter, the condition of each mouse was observed daily to detect abnormalities such as changes in physical appearance, behavioral signs and body weight. All mice were finally euthanized after 14 d of observation, and major organs (brain, heart, lungs, liver and kidneys) were harvested for histopathological examination after staining with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E).",

We and others have provided evidence to show that different flavonoid components in the EA fraction of H. cordata exert varying degrees of antiviral activity against different viruses. Our findings corroborate previous evidence that among the flavonoid components, quercetin is the most effective against DENV-2 [13]. Wleklik et al. emphasized that there is a structural basis for the distinct differences in antiviral activities of flavonoids [21].

In comparison, however, we observed that the EA fraction and quercetin yielded a longer-lasting antiviral effect of up to 6 d. This finding may be explained by superimposition of the two 3C-like proteinases of MHV and SARS CoV which illustrates that certain amino acid residues residing within 7 \u00c5 of the active site (C145) are different (not shown). Thus, these amino acid disparities may influence recognition and binding of cinanserin hydrochloride to the active site and may also lead to its lower affinity for 3C-like proteinase of MHV than SARS-coronavirus. Competitive binding of cinanserin hydrochloride to the active site of 3C-like proteinase hinders the processing of the precursor polyprotein to generate functional replicase necessary for viral replication [32], [33], [34].",

Moreover, the EA fraction was also more potent than all the individual compounds tested (including their combination) and did not cause any cytotoxicity to mammalian kidney (BHK) and liver (CCL9.1) cell lines in vitro, nor any acute toxicity or pathology of major murine organs in vivo. This feature reiterates the synergistic effects of the combination of multiple flavonoids and other constituents within H. cordata that confer optimal antiviral activities and minimal toxicity [35], in keeping with the majority of successful traditional Chinese medicine.",

To complement this study, future in vivo studies are warranted to assess the efficacy of the EA fraction of H. cordata against coronaviruses and dengue viruses using the relevant mouse models [39]. However, further in vivo experiments are necessary to further assess the long-term safety of H. cordata as an antiviral agent in biological systems, including acquiring crucial information on its adsorption, distribution, metabolism and elimination. To address the important issue of batch-to-batch variation, greater efforts should also focus on the quality control of extracts derived from this medicinal plant. Finally, the mechanisms of action of the EA fraction and its constituent flavonoids against viruses at the molecular level need to be further elucidated [40].",
