The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been a natural focus of many of these miniaturization efforts, owing to its capability to efficiently replicate target regions ofinterest from small quantities template DNA. Scale-down ofPCR has proven to be particularly challenging, however, due to an unfavorable combination of relatively severe temperature extremes (resulting in the need to repeatedly heat minute aqueous sample volumes to temperatures in the vicinity of95'C with minimal evaporation) and high surface area to volume conditions imposed by nanoliter reactor geometries (often leading to inhibition ofthe reaction by nonspecific adsorption ofreagents at the reactor walls). Despite these daunting challenges, considerable progress has been made in the development of microfluidic devices capable ofperforming increasingly sophisticated PCR-based bioassays.This chapter reviews the progress that has been made to date and assessesthe outlook for future advances.",

            "text": "The PCR process involves repeatedly cycling a reagent mixture containing template DNA, primers, dNTPs, a thermostable polymerase enzyme and other buffering additives, through thermal conditions corresponding to (1) denaturation ofthe double-stranded template (~95'C), (2) annealing ofsingle-stranded oligonucleotide primers at complementary locations flanking the target region (~50-65'C) and (3) enzyme directed synthesis of the complementary strand (~72'C). The number of target DNA copies increases exponentially as this cycling process is repeated, doubling with each cycle under ideal conditions. Although the kinetics associated with each step in the PCRprocess are rapid when considered individually.v\" a typical 30-40 cycle replication still requires timescales of order 1-2 hours to complete. These prolonged reaction times are largely a reflection ofthe highly inefficient design ofmany conventional thermocycling instruments, where thermally massive hardware components (e.g., metal thermal blocks) and low-conductivity plastic reaction vessels (e.g., polypropylene tubes) combine to produce an unfavorable coupling between increased thermal energy requirements associated with rapid heating and cooling and the necessity to hold the temperature constant at each step for a sufficiendy long time to ensure that the entire reagent volume attains thermal equilibrium. Progress has been made in the development offaster benchtop-scale thermocyclers, most notably by approaches that involve replacing plastic reaction tubes with thin glassmicro-capillaries and using techniques ranging from forced air circulation to infrared heating for temperature control.I\" These configurations allow the reaction mixture to be distributed over a greater surface area for more efficient heat transfer, although overall throughput can still be limited by the capillary loading, sealing and unloading processes.",

            "text": "In addition to these benchtop-scale approaches, increasing interest has been focused on performing PCR in miniaturized systems where ultra-small reaction volumes (typically in the nL range) not only gready reduce reagent consumption, but can also be rapidly heated and cooled while simultaneously lowering costs due to gready reduced reagent consumption. Moreover, the use ofphotolithographic microfabrication offers the potential to produce hundreds or thousands ofdevices at once, bringing hardware costs to a level of$l or less.These highly desirable characteristics have stimulated considerable interest in the area ofmicrofabricated thermocycling systems. However the use ofsuch small reaction volumes can pose significant challenges including adverse effects associated with evaporation and nonspecific absorption to the microchannel walls under high surface to volume conditions. Progress continues to be made toward addressing the challenges facing development ofmicrofluidic thermocycling systems and the interested reader is referred to several recent reviews for more details.6. [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] Despite its importance as a key enabling technology, PCR is only one step in a broader sequence of processes that comprise a complete molecular biology assay. Some combination of sample isolation and collection, pre and postreaction purification, subsequent biochemical reactions and product detection and analysis must also be performed. On the rnacroscale, these steps are typically carried out in a conventional laboratory setting, often requiring dedicated instruments and personnel to be employed at each stage along with the need to repeatedly prepare and dispense precise sample and reagent mixtures. These processes can not only be tedious and time consuming, they also introduce multiple opportunities for measurement errors and sample contamination. The ability to adapt a series of these operations to a miniaturized 'lab-on-a-chip' format has the potential to address these limitations, yielding significant reductions in analysis time and cost. Moreover, a fully self-contained portable design offers the potential to minimize tedious manual fluidic manipulations and sample contamination issues.",

Following PCR, the products were electrokinetically injected into a separation channel filled with a sieving gel matrix containing a fluorescent intercalating dye and detected using a laser excited confocal imaging system. Total analysis times ranging from 20 to 4S minutes were reported. Subsequent refinements to this basic design involved integrating both the PCR reactor and electrophoresis column into a single continuous glass microchannel network. In one adaptation reagents were loaded and sealed inside a 280 nL reaction chamber using a valve/vent manifold mounted on top of the chip and temperature control was provided by thin film heater and thermocouple elements affixed to the back side.\" Upon completion ofthe reaction, the manifold was removed and platinum electrode wires were inserted into the accessholes so that the products could be electrokinetically transported to the electrophoresis channel for analysis. This design was used to demonstrate amplification of targets from cloning vector and genomic control templates with sufficient sensitivity to permit single molecule detection.\" A further improvement to the design involved integration ofmicrofabricated heaters and temperature sensors to actuate thermocycling within a 200 nL reaction chamber.f This device was used to perform multiplex sex determination from human genomic DNA in under 1S minutes. A self-contained portable version was also constructed and used to perform multiplex PCR directly from whole bacterial cells in 30 minutes, with product detection accomplished using fluorescently labeled primers (Fig. lA) .29",

Zhou and coworkers also demonstrated a glass microchip design integrating PCR and gel electrophoresis with an external thermoelectric thermocycling apparatus to perform a duplex PCR analysis of24O and 438 base pair (bp) targets associated with the SARS coronavirus.\" Other examples ofintegration include designs employing hybrid PDMS/glass microchips\" and designs interfacing a silicon PCR microchip with integrated temperature control to a glass electrophoresis microchip.l\" A particularly novel design reported by Koh et al consisted ofa plastic microfluidic chip with integrated temperature control that incorporated on-chip photopolymerized gel valves that not only sealed reagents inside the PCR reactor but also allowed the products to be electrokinetically extracted through the valve material and directed into an electrophoresis channel for separation and detection. 37 The device was used for successful analysis oftargets from two different bacterial genomic templates with a detection limit on the order ofsix DNA copies.",

            "text": "Increases in device complexity that accompanies simultaneous miniaturization and integration ofmultiple sample processing and analysis steps can pose daunting challenges, however progress is steadily being made toward addressing many of these issues resulting in the development of increasingly sophisticated designs (Table 4 ). An early compelling example illustrating the power of miniaturized genomic analysis systems was the hybrid glass-silicon design developed in the Burns group,\" capable of performing a series of liquid metering, thermal reaction and analysis operations. This pioneering device was used to amplify a 106 bp DNA target from a bacterial genomic template via an isothermal strand displacement amplification (SDA) process followed by gel electrophoresis with integrated photodetection ofthe fluorescently labeled reaction products. A greatly improved version of this design was recently reported that is capable of performing a complete genotyping assayinvolving two sequential reactions followed by an electrophoretic separation in an ultra-compact 1.5x 1.6cm hybrid glass/silicon microfluidic chip (Fig. 3A) .50 Sample DNA and PCR reagents were loaded into the chip and pneumatically propelled into a reaction zone where they were sealed using paraffin phase change valves.Thermocyclingwas actuated using an array ofintegrated resistive heaters and temperature sensors, with the reaction zone thermally isolated from the rest of the chip. Upon completion ofthe PCR reaction, the sealing valveswere opened and the sample was propelled forward, mixed with additional reagents and incubated to perform a restriction enzyme digestion reaction. Upon completion of the second reaction, the products were directed into a gel electrophoresis column for analysis. This system was used to perform a PCR-RFLP assayfor influenza A virus detection, illustrating tremendous potential as a generic platform suitable for use in a wide range of genotyping applications. Another notable recent advancement has been reported by the Mathies group, where a multilayer glass/PDMS device was used to perform integrated Sanger cycle sequencing of DNA-a reaction requiring similar thermal cycling parameters as PCR (Fig. 3B )Y Sequencing reactions were performed in 250 nL reactors, after which the products were electrokinetically transported into a novel capture gel for purification. Here, oligonucleotides complementary to the region immediately adjacent to one of the sequencing primers were immobilized in a sparsely crosslinked polyacrylamide gel plug, such that the sequencing products could be retained inside the gel while unincorporated primers and other reagents passed through. Upon heating the gel to a temperature above the primer melting point, the hybridized products were released and electrokinetlcally injected into the separation channel. Read lengths of 556 bases were achieved with a 99% base call accuracy, demonstrating tremendous potential for significant reductions in cost and time scales associated with genome sequencing.",

            "text": "Buoyancy driven natural convection phenomena have also been investigated as a means of accelerating the thermocycling process. By designing reaction chambers that harness an imposed static temperature gradient to generate a circulatory convective flow field, PCR reagents can be automatically transported through temperature zones associated with denaturing, annealing and extension conditions. Convective flow thermocyclers may be broadly classified as cavity-based or loop-based systems, depending on the nature of the flow field generated. Cavity-based designs typically consist of reactor geometries in which the PCR reagents are enclosed between upper and lower surfaces maintained at annealing and denaturing temperatures, respectively.52'54 When the aqueous PCR reagent mixture is heated from below, an unstable \"top heavy\" arrangement is created which can provide sufficient driving force to establish a continuous circulatory flow in much the same fashion as in an ordinary lava lamp. Here, thermocycling parameters (e.g., cycling time, residence time within each temperature zone) are controlled by an interplay between reactor geometry (height to diameter aspect ratio) and the magnitude ofthe imposed temperature gradient. Krishnan et al successfully demonstrated this concept by amplifying a 295 bp~-actin target from a human genomic DNA template in a 35 ul, cylindrical reactor (Fig. 4A) . 52 In subsequent work, this simple design has been adapted to perform amplification of a 191 bp target associated with membrane channel proteins M 1 and M2 ofthe influenza-A virus with cycling times ranging from 15 to 40 minutes in a multiwell cartridge format that offers potential for use in high throughput settings. 53.55 Convectively driven PCR of a 96 bp target from a bacterial genomic template has also been demonstrated by Braun et al in low aspect ratio cylindrical cavities using either focused infrared heating or a micro immersion heater inserted at the center ofa low aspect ratio cavity to drive the flow (Fig. 4B) . [56] [57] [58] Successful PCR amplification has also been demonstrated in closed-loop convective flow systems. These designs are attractive because oftheir ability to generate unidirectional flows along a closed path enablingcycling parameters to be precisely controlled. Wheeler and coworkers designed a novel disposable polypropylene reactor in which opposite sides ofa racetrack-shaped flow loop were maintained at 94 and 55\u00b0C respectively to amplify targets ranging from 58 to 160 bp from a bacterial genomic template (Fig. 4C) ,59 while Chen et al employed a triangular arrangement with three independently controlled temperature zones maintained at 94, 55 and 72\u00b0C to amplify 305 and 700 bp targets from a bacterial genomic template (Fig. 4D) . 60 Krishnan ec al employed both triangular and racetrack shaped designs to amplify 191 and 297 bp targets from control and human genomic DNA targets respectively.\" Most recently, Agrawal et al have demonstrated a triangular design in which flow loops are constructed using disposable plastic tubing (Fig. 4\u00a3) . 61 Here, two opposing sides of the loop are maintained at denaturing and extension temperatures using independently controlled thermoelectric heaters while the third side passivelyattains annealing conditions. This system is capable ofperforming single and multiplex PCR for targets ranging from 191 bp to 1.3 kb within 10 to 50 minutes using 10 to 25 ul, reaction volumes, highlighting ",

A number ofchallenges remain, however, including development ofimproved miniaturized fluid handling technology capable ofprecisely metering, transporting and sealing nanoliter liquid volumes ro prevent evaporation without relying on bulky off-chip mechanical hardware. Potential inhibitory effects that arise under ultra-high surface to volume geometric conditions are also likely to remain a serious consideration as reactor volumes continue to shrink. Finally, improvements are still needed in the area ofproduct detection, where the necessity to employ benchtop-scale fluorescence imaging systems often limits portability. Developments in these areas are ongoing and ultimately have the potential to greatly expand the use ofgenomic analysis technology by making the capability to perform an increasingly sophisticated array of assaysaccessible for use in a wide range of settings by those who need it most .",
