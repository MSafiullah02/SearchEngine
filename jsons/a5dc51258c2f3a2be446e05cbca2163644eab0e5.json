Re-positioning cheap, freely available and safe drugs is a priority. The paper proposes evidence for the potential use of diethylcarbamazine (DEC) in the treatment of COVID-19. DEC has inhibitory effects on arachidonic acid metabolism to prostaglandins, little known anti-viral effects on animal retroviruses and demonstrated anti-inflammatory actions in animal models of lung inflammation indicating the need to explore this hypothesis further. We believe this is the first time DEC is being proposed to treat COVID-19.",

The virus is a singlestranded RNA virus belonging to the Coronaviridae family, members of which cause mild infections. However, the epidemics caused by Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) resulted in alarming morbidity and mortality. COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 appears to surpass both these in severity. Given the urgency of the outbreak, there is growing interest in repurposing existing agents which have been approved already or to develop novel drugs that can improve the clinical outcome of affected patients.",

            "text": "SARS-CoV-2 has an affinity to the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) receptors which are expressed in human respiratory epithelia in the lungs. It spreads through the respiratory tract leading to fever, cough, and subsequently in those susceptible to have serious outcomes, it may lead to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) (6) . The pathogenesis of severe disease is considered to be due to the cytokine storm or a dysregulation, in addition to the cytopathic effects of the virus. Both are localized mainly to the lungs due to the presence of high concentrations of virus binding receptors in pneumocytes (7). Many cytokines are implicated in the massive response observed in seriously ill patients. The rapid activation of CD4 + T cells leads to proliferation and differentiation into Th1 cells which secrete proinflammatory cytokines (9) . The response consists of high concentrations of IL1B, IFN\u03b3, IP10, and MCP1 (10). Severely ill patients who required intensive care unit (ICU) admission had higher concentrations of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GCSF), IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF\u03b1 than did those not requiring ICU admission. Other studies report the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, interferon gamma, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). GM-CSF activates monocytes to release more IL-6 leading to the formation of a cytokine storm, which triggers ARDS, multi-organ failure (MOF) and even death (9) . Furthermore, the infection also initiates an increased secretion of T-helper-2 (Th2) cytokines such as IL4 and IL10. These suppress inflammation and this phenomenon is not seen with SARS-CoV infection (11) .",

The mechanism involves respiratory dendritic cells (rDC) in the lungs that migrate to the mediastinal lymph nodes and prime T-cells that in turn migrate to the lungs to mount an immune response. An age-related defect in T-cell function is linked to decreased migration of rDC because of increased levels of prostaglandin-D (PGD2) in ageing mice. The resulting poor T cell response is associated with severe infection (13) .",
