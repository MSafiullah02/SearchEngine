Despite several clinical trials are currently in place, there are still no specific therapies or any vaccine against COVID-19, approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), European medicines Agency (EMA), as well as the Bulgarian Drug Agency (BDA) [3] . The only option available is using off-label or compassionate use (CU) therapies, including antiretrovirals, antiparasitic agents, anti-inflammatory compounds, and convalescent plasma [4] . As the SARS-CoV-2 continues to spread rapidly across the world, the request numbers for CU has risen exponentially.",

The main characteristics of the Bulgarian health care system, including a high level of centralization, a single payer to administer social health insurance, as well as limited supply of workforce and bed capacity of intensive care units (ICU). Bulgaria recently introduced a Health Technology Assessment (HTA) framework which relies on clinical and economic criteria and adopted particular steps for pricing and reimbursement of new medicines [5] . The global pandemic mandates BDA for reasonable update of the existing national regulation and procedures concerning CU and off-label therapies. In era of the COVID-19 era, it is essential for Bulgarian patients to have early and expanded access to investigational drugs for compassionate therapies. CU, also referred to as expanded access, is the therapeutic use of investigational drugs outside of clinical trials. EMA defines as CU a treatment option that allows the use of an unauthorized medicinal product which is under development [3] .",

Unfortunately, the dearth in the existing national regulation in Bulgaria leads to delayed or difficult access to investigational drugs via CU programs, as well as exclude many patient groups who are unable to fulfill the eligibility criteria of clinical trials, and consequently restrict them from early access to promising drugs and hopeful treatments [3] . Remdesivir, also known as GS-5734, has been recognized as a promising antiviral drug, originally developed for the treatment of Ebola virus infection [8] . While it did not prove efficacy in human clinical trials for this disease, it has shown efficacy against RNA viruses (including SARS/MERS-CoV5), Paramyxoviridae (such as Nipahvirus, respiratory syncytial virus, and Hendra virus). Remdesivir is an adenosine analog that incorporates into nascent viral RNA chains and results in pre-mature termination. It appears to have a favorable clinical safety profile, as reported in multiple case reports and randomized trials of Ebola virus disease. It has thus garnered significant attention for its potential use as a treatment option for COVID-19.",

The regulation update will help the Bulgarian health policy makers and BDA to provide a quick and efficient response to patients' needs and demand to investigational drugs via CU programs. Finally, the COVID-19 outbreak provides an excellent opportunity to reflect on current needs and gaps in the existing national regulation regarding CU [10] . It is also timely to consider the readiness of the Bulgarian health care system to meet the challenges, new and unexpected threats and risks, both as regards problems and solutions. The update of the existing national regulation regarding CU is vital to ensure effective and sustainable development and delivery of health policy and technology over the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.",

On 25 and 26 March 2020, four EU countries (Estonia, Greece, Netherlands and Romania) requested an opinion on the CU for remdesivir from the EMA Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP), in accordance with Article 83(3) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 [7]. The legal basis for this application refers to: Article 83(3) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The CHMP supports this position and considers that the CU programs should be used for patients who do not participate in a clinical trial.",
