            "text": "Complex dynamic networks are ubiquitous in nature and human society. In recent years research in large-scale networks has seen a rapid development in various disciplines, inspired by the discovery of two features shared by many real-world networks: small-world and scale-free. This paper introduces how human languages can be studied in this light, and reports some work available in this area. There are two directions of exploration. One is to study networks existing in the language system. Various lexical networks can be built based on different relationships between words, being semantic or syntactic. Recent studies have shown that these lexical networks exhibit small-world and scale-free features. The findings of these global structures of the mental lexicon, which are not detectable in traditional analyses on semantic networks, trigger more interests in the global structures of the mental lexicon and language in general from a network perspective. The other direction of exploration is to study networks of language users (i.e. social networks of people in the linguistic community), and their role in language evolution. Social networks also show small-world and scale-free features, which cannot be captured by random or regular network models. In the past, computational models of language change and language emergence often assume a population to have a random or regular structure, and there has been little discussion how network structures may affect the dynamics. In the second part of the paper, a series of simulation models of diffusion of linguistic innovation are used to illustrate the importance of choosing realistic conditions of population structure for modeling language change.. Four types of social networks are compared, which exhibit two categories of diffusion dynamics. While the questions about which type of networks are more appropriate for modeling still remains, we give some preliminary suggestions for choosing the type of social networks for modeling.",

Some systems appear as networks in an obvious way as they have the physical features of network structure, for example, the telephone network, the power and gas transmission system, the Internet, electronic circuits, and so on. More importantly, we can construct networks from systems which do not appear as networks at first sight, as the connections between nodes are not physical links but some abstract relationship, such as food webs, actors' and scientists' collaboration networks, friendship networks, etc. Table 1 gives some examples of networks. Studies on networks can be traced back to Leonard Euler's mathematical solution of the K\u00f6nigsberg bridge problem in 1735, which started an important branch of mathematics known as graph theory 1 .",

Parallel to mathematics, in social sciences, extensive works on social networks have been carried out since the 1930s (Scott 1991 (Scott /2000 . Also, it has been recognized that the network can be the common pattern of life systems at all levels, ranging from food webs studied by ecologists, to the neural systems in the brain studied by neuroscientists which have been applied in computer sciences as artificial neural networks, to the intercellular protein-protein interaction networks and genetic regulatory networks (Newman 2002) .",

Owing to the availability of powerful computational equipment and techniques, it has become possible to investigate large-scale complex networks in the real world, such as the Internet, World Wide Web (WWW), etc. While early studies mostly carried out analyses of small networks and focused on properties of individual nodes or subnets of the networks, recent studies have been more interested in examining the global statistical properties of large scale networks. Moreover, while early studies mostly assumed either regular or random networks (as illustrated in Figure 1 (a) and (b)) as the model for real-world systems, recent empirical studies have found that real-world networks exhibit features which can not be captured alone by either of these two types of networks. Figure 1 (c) shows an example of a complex large real-world network -a map of the Internet. Two important features have been discovered: small-world (Watts & Strogatz 1998 ) and scale-free (Barab\u00e1si & Albert 1999) . Small-world networks are found, similar to random network, to have a short characteristic path length (the terminologies of network measures discussed in the paper are given in 1 The terms \"network\", \"node\" and \"link\" we adopt in this study are used in computer science. In mathematics, a \"network\" is called a \"graph\", and \"vertex\" and \"edge\" are the terminologies corresponding to \"node\" and \"link\" respectively. 2 Several popular books and overviews have been published recently for a general audience that provide a good coverage of the background and development of the field (Watts 1999 , Barab\u00e1si 2002 , Buchanan 2002 , Watts 2003 . More technical resources can be found from a number of comprehensive reviews (Dorogovtsev & Mendes 2002 , Newman 2003 , Barab\u00e1si & Albert 2003 . 3 The network is visualized using a software package for large-network analysis called Pajek, developed by Vladimir Batagelj and Andrej Mrvar.

Many real-world systems, which had not been studied as networks, are reformulated and analyzed within a network framework. Many of them are shown to exhibit the small-world and/or scale-free properties. In this light, phenomena which appear as unrelated, such as the spread of AIDS virus, the growth of Yahoo and Google as gigantic hubs in WWW, the Asian economic meltdown, etc., can be explained with the same principles. More importantly, some new insights are obtained for old questions which traditional approaches are not able to achieve. For example, in epidemics studies, when the model takes into account the population structure as a scale-free network, it is shown that the traditional public health approach of random immunization could easily fail. Instead, identifying and immunizing the hubs in the network may provide a more effective way to stop epidemics. Similarly, identifying hubs in cancerous cells and developing ways of taking them out, shows enormous promise in the fight against cancer (Barab\u00e1si 2002) . Meanwhile, more complex measures are applied to large-scale networks, such as network resilience, mixing patterns, hierarchical or community structures, motifs, and so on (Newman 2003) . Moreover, the commonality of properties found in the diverse networks also leads researchers to search for explanation for some universal principles governing the formation and evolution of these networks, which has become a topic with increasing importance in network research in general (EuroPhy 2004) .",

Concerning human language, there are at least two types of networks of interest to linguists. The first type is the networks existing in the language system. Network is in fact not a new term in linguistics. The concept of semantic network is said to be traceable all the way back to Aristotle (Anderson & Bower 1973:9) . The term \"semantic network\" dates back at least to Ross Quillian (1968) , where he conceives that meanings, or concepts, in language are organized in a network fashion. In semantic networks, words or meanings are the nodes and various semantic relationships are the links. Later development in semantic networks continues to refine the treehierarchy representations. The research has been focusing on small scale sub-networks. There had been little concern of the global structure of large-scale semantic networks. In the last few years, researchers have started to construct and analyze lexical networks on a grand scale (including not only semantic but also syntactic relationships), such as in English (e.g. Ferrer & Sol\u00e9 2001a; Dorogovtsev & Mendes 2001; Motter et al. 2002; Sigman & Cecchi 2002; Steyvers & Tenenbaum 2005) and in Czech, German, and Romanian (Ferrer et al. 2004) . It is shown that large-scale lexical networks exhibit interesting features shared with networks in other areas.",

Individual language users are taken as the nodes of the network, and the links are the linguistic interactions between individuals. There have been extensive empirical studies on how speakers' language use in an on-going changing situation is correlated with their roles in the social networks (Milroy 1980 , Eckert 2000 . However, these studies mostly focused on synchronic variations in social networks of small local communities. It is hard to conduct sociolinguistic research on large-scale social networks, and even harder to examine the effect of different social networks on language change on a large time scale. As a complementary approach, computational modeling studies can offer a way to study the long-term effect of language change in speech communities of any sizes and structures. Existing models of language change, however, either do not consider the actual population structure (Niyogi & Berwick 1997), or assume regular or random networks as the population structure (Nettle 1999a) . Ke et al. (2004) has shown that different network structures affect the dynamics of language change significantly. To study language change with more systematic and refined network structures, which is mostly an unexplored area, will provide a viable platform to re-examine many theoretical questions in language change and historical linguistics.",

            "text": "One of the features that distinguish human language from other animals' communication system is that human language has a large number of words (Hauser et al. 2002) . For a normal high school student, the average size of the receptive vocabulary is over 100,000 (Miller & Gildea 1987) . Speakers can navigate the massive mental lexicon in a highly efficient way (the reaction time to judge whether a form is a legitimate word in the language usually takes less than 100 mini-second). How is this possible? It has been recognized that the relational structure, which refers to the fact that words are related to other words, as synonyms, antonyms, hyponyms, or hypernyms, etc, may provide an account for the organization of the mental lexicon. When a word is remembered, a set of properties have to be remembered, such as the phonological form, the grammatical category, the meanings etc. If every word had to be remembered with such a full set of properties, the storage requirement and the processing time would be enormous. However, the relational structure decreases the storage requirement. For example, for those words which belong to a hierarchy of super-ordinate relationship, some of the properties of the super-ordinate words may be inherited by the lower-level words (Quillian 1968) . For instance, \"animal\" has the feature of [+animate] and its hyponyms \"dog\" and \"cat\" may inherit this feature without requiring duplicate storage. While early studies on semantic networks mostly focused on refining the local networks of specific semantic domains, the global structures of the network have been largely unexplored. Recently, inspired by the recent new developments in the areas of network theory, scientists have started to examine the global organization of lexical networks in languages.",

            "text": "There have been a number of reports about large-scale lexical networks of various nature (Ferrer & Sol\u00e9 2001a , Sigman & Cecchi 2002 , Motter et al. 2002 , Ferrer et al. 2004 , Steyvers & Tenenbaum 2005 , among others). There have been mainly two types of networks, based on the nature of the relationship between nodes considered in the network construction. One is to define the links in terms of semantic relationships, and the other is to define the links in terms of grammatical relationships. Interestingly, despite the different nature of these networks, they exhibit convergent features in their global structures. In particular, the networks all exhibit both small-world and scale-free characteristics. These structural characteristics are considered to reflect the self-organization feature of the lexicon, which may account for the fast retrieval of the mental lexicon. Also, there may exist some universal mechanisms for the formation of these networks, shared by networks in other areas such as biological and technological systems. We now give a brief review of these networks reported so far. Motter et al. (2002) construct a network of synonyms using Moby thesaurus dictionary 4 . Words which appear as synonyms in the dictionary have a link between them. It is found that this network shows small-world characteristics. The network is highly clustered (clustering coefficient C=0.52), while a random network with the same size and same connectivity only has a C=0.002. The network has a small characteristic path length (L=3.16), considering the huge size of the network (30,244 nodes). To connect two randomly selected words, it only needs to go through about 2 other words. Interestingly, similar small L is found in Ferrer & Sol\u00e9 (2001a) , which gives L=2.63 for a network with 478,773 nodes, while F&S's model uses a totally different method to construct the network -taking collocation relationships between words as links (to be described in Section 2.2.3). The convergent results from two different methods suggest that the small-world feature is significant, and present in several dimensions of the mental lexicon, both semantic and syntactic.",

A similar tworegime degree distribution is also attested in Ferrer & Sol\u00e9 (2001a) (more details are given in a later section on degree distribution). Steyvers & Tenenbaum (2005) carry out similar studies on three networks built from different sources: one is based on a free-association database, one uses data in WordNet, and the third one is a synonym network using Roget's Thesaurus. Similar findings have been reported for these networks, including short characteristic path length, high clustering coefficient, and degree distribution following a power law. Sigman and Cecchi (2002) analyze the structure of nouns in the WordNet database (version 1.6). There are mainly four types of semantic relationships between nouns: I: hyponymy/hypernymy (e.g. \"rose\" and \"flower\"); II: antonymy (e.g. \"good\" and \"bad\"); III: meronymy/holonymy (e.g. \"arm\" and \"body\"); IV: polysemy (e.g. \"(department) head\" and \"head (of a bird)\"). In the study, four networks are constructed based on different combinations of different semantic relationships, N1={I+II}, N2={I+III}, N3={I+IV}, and N4={I+III+IV}.",

It is shown that the characteristic path length of N2 is significantly larger than the characteristic path length of the corresponding semi-random network. In comparison, with the inclusion of polysemy, the networks N3 and N4 exhibit the characteristics of small-world networks, a small characteristic path length similar to a random network and a clustering coefficient significantly larger than random networks. N4 shows that adding meronymy upon the presence of polysemy does not result in any further significant change. Comparing the four networks, we can see that polysemy plays an important role in making the lexical network a small world network.",

In the hypernymy tree, the way to go from one meaning to another is climbing up and down the tree. For example, to go from dog to oak, one would follow the trajectory: dog-canine-carnivore-placental-mammal chordate-animal-life formplant-woody plant-vascular plant-tree-oak. In the hypernymy tree without polysemy, the mean distance from a node to the rest of the vertices progresses as one goes deeper in the tree. It is found that there is a high correlation between the mean distance and deepness. However, when polysemy is added, this correlation is weakened significantly. They also carried out the traffic analysis, which measures the number of paths passing through each vertex, so as to identify the most active hubs in the network. The study finds that in the network without the presence of polysemy, the most active nodes are those with a large number of hyponyms. This is mainly because all of the corresponding hyponyms have to pass through their hypernymy to navigate to the rest of the network. When polysemy is included, however, the nodes with the most traffic are those words which are the most polysemous and have the most connected neighbors, such as \"head\", \"line\" and \"point\".",

Thus they construct syntactic dependency networks, with directed links from modifier to head words.

The networks all exhibit small world patterns (small characteristic path length and high clustering coefficient) and scale-free structure (power-law degree distribution). Also these networks show the presence of a hierarchical organization, as indicated by a high correlation between degree and cluster coefficient. Furthermore, these networks show uniformly a power-law distribution of betweenness centrality, and dissortative mixing (highly connected words tend not to be interconnected).

(2002) , though without explicit claim, seem to have also taken such an assumption, as reflected in the example they use to illustrate the connections in the conceptual network (reproduced in Figure 3 (a)). They show there is a shortcut connection between \"universe\" and \"character\", through the word \"nature\". Obviously, \"nature\" and \"character\" are polysemes. Meanings which seem distant from each other can be linked through these polysemes. Figure 3 (b) gives another example where three distinct meanings, \"wrinkle\", \"cable\" and \"melody\", are linked through the word \"line\", which is the second most polysemous according to WordNet (the first word is \"head\"). We hypothesize that the small-world structure found in the synonym network in Motter et al. (2002) is mainly due to the presence of polysemy; when only one meaning of each word is taken to construct the network (to remove the polysemes), the small-world properties may not be present any more.

This claim appears to us as confusing the cause and effect. The existence of polysemy is not because fast navigation of the mental lexicon requires its presence to make the semantic network like a small-world network. On the contrary, polysemy is an unavoidable product of human cognition, i.e. from human's metaphoric thinking, imagery, and nature letter universe world actor character line cable wrinkle melody generalization, which makes semantic extension a universal phenomenon in languages and results in a large number of polysemes (Lakoff 1987) .

In fact the WordNet database does not provide such a distinction. As polysemy is produced by various mechanisms of semantic extension, different meanings of a polyseme are semantically related, though their relationships may not be obvious when the intermediate stages of semantic extension are not easy to detect after some time, especially when the words are borrowed from other languages. For example, \"skate\" (as a kind of shoes) and \"skate\" (as a kind of fish) are both from Old Dutch. In contrast, homophonous words have the same pronunciation but different meanings, and these meanings do not have any semantic relationship, such as \"bear\" as an animal and \"bear\" as a verb meaning \"tolerate\". Most homophones are results of sound change, where two words, originally with different pronunciations, become the same. Therefore, homophony is also an unavoidable phenomenon in language. As homophony and polysemy are distinct in their origin, we speculate that the semantic distance between different meanings of the same form in these two categories would exhibit significant differences. Therefore when these two types of words are differentiated and treated differently in the semantic network, they may change the structure of the semantic network significantly.",

First, the distributions do not all follow a perfect power-law. In both Ferrer & Sol\u00e9 (2001a) and Motter et al. (2002) the degree distributions of the constructed networks exhibit a two-regime feature. Motter et al. (2002) suggest that the high-degree range follows a powerlaw distribution while the low-degree range shows an exponential distribution, as shown in Figure 4 Sigman & Cecchi (2002) show that the three networks constructed respectively with hypernymyhyponymy, meronymy-holonymy and polysemy relationships all exhibit power-law degree distributions. We carried out similar analysis using a newer version of WordNet (1.7.1) and obtained similar results ( Figure 5 ). However, we notice that in the right part of the graph, the distribution of meanings with high degree become less clean, especially in the network of hypernym/hyponym relationship. There are a small number of senses which are highly connected, such as \"herb\" (k=961), \"writer\" (k=896), \"author\" (k=889) and \"bush\" (k=781), but the distribution of these words does not follow a power-law any more. One account for this irregular part is that these nodes of high degree are constructed with more detailed coverage. For example, the many connections to the sense \"herb\" include names of different herbs, and \"writer\" and \"author\" have many names of the individual writers. So these especially biased nodes make the tail part deviate from a power-law.",

This may provide some new quantitative measures of the stylistic differences of different speakers.

And by comparing how much the individual speakers' lexical networks overlap with the collective semantic network, we may have a better way to examine how well the semantic areas are covered in individuals' limited lexicons. These data may provide some suggestions regarding the question whether the upper limit of the size of individual lexicons (Cheng 1998 ) is due to the satisfaction of individuals' communication needs, instead of memory limitation.",

As they explain, \"when a new node is added to the network, it has the same probability of attaching to any one of the already existing nodes. But, once it attaches a node j it has the tendency to connect preferentially to the nodes that are already connected to j\". Therefore, the random attachment allows a new node to make a random connection, which provides an equal chance for those nodes with small degrees, resulting in the exponential decay of the low-degree portion in the distribution. Meanwhile, the preferential attachment makes the hubs emerge and results in the power-law in the highdegree portion.",

In addition to adding links between the new nodes and the old nodes, they propose that the old nodes themselves may increase their connections gradually. In each step, while the new node is attached to an old node based on preferential attachment, there are a number of new links between old nodes in the growing network. They show that using this method the simulated network exhibits the same two-regime degree distribution found in the empirical network. Steyvers & Tenenbaum (2005) introduce a growing network model which incorporates two factors in the preferential attachment: new words (concepts) preferentially attach not only to existing highly connected words, but also to words with high utility in terms of word frequency (i.e. words of a higher frequency have a higher utility). The higher the frequency of a word, the higher probability it will get connected. Furthermore, once such a preferential word x is selected for the new word to connect with, the new word is also preferentially connected to the neighbors of x, so as to preserve the local neighbors. The latter mechanism is very similar to what has been proposed in Motter et al. (2002) . Also similar mechanisms has been proposed for social network models (Jin et al. 2001) , in which new connections are more likely to be made between nodes which have some existing shared neighbors. Figure 6 (a) shows the simulation results for the degree with different utilities acquired at different times. They further test the hypothesis using empirical data, including rating of words' acquisition time given by adult and results of children's picture naming, comparing the degree of words with respect to the estimated age of acquisition of the words and frequency of words (shown in Figure 6 (b)). It is found that the empirical data confirm well with the prediction shown in Figure 6 (a).",

We may measure the development by comparing the lexical networks of a child at consecutive stages, as well as networks among different children, and networks between children's and their care-takers'. While research has shown that there is a large degree of individual differences in language development, network analyses provide more quantitative indices (Ke & Yao, submitted) . For example, when we measure two independent parameters during the growth of the networks, that is, the size and the connectivity, we find that children differ in their developmental paths significantly: children with a small vocabulary (i.e. small network size), often viewed as late talkers, may use the words they have learnt in a more flexible and effective way, which is shown by the large connectivity of their lexical networks. Therefore the traditional simple categorization of early vs. late talkers appears to be insufficient in reflecting these different paths of development. Also, the network analyses provide more informative measures to see how the children's language approaches to the adult model, and how their development interacts with their adult care-takers' language. To illustrate the above observations, Figure 7 shows four children's language development in terms of the two measures on the lexical networks (i.e. size and average degree), and those of their mothers, as reproduced from Ke & Yao (submitted) . It will be an exciting new research direction to analyze language development and carry out crosslinguistic comparison from a network perspective, by making use of the existing large corpora of children's acquisition data, such as CHILDES (MacWhinney 2000) . Network analyses can be done independent of specific syntactic frameworks. The global patterns in lexical networks can reveal developmental features which are not easily detected in traditional text analyses, and the syntactical development may be revealed by changes of the global structure of the lexical networks. Network measures may also help to identify individual differences in a more systematic way.",

This is also observed in lexical decision tasks, tip-of-the-tongue (TOT) phenomena and aphasia (Aitchison 1987 (Aitchison /1994 ). Coordination includes not only words which are synonyms and antonyms, but also words which belong to the same hypernym, such as \"hungry\", \"thirsty\" and \"tired\" shown in Table 1 , and the color terms \"red\", \"white\" and \"blue\".

In sociolinguistics, empirical studies in social networks often examine in detail the networks of small communities and focus on the relation between individuals' social network properties and their linguistic performance. A classic study in this area is the work done by Milroy and colleagues (Milroy 1980 (Milroy /1987 , in which they examined three stable inner-city communities of Belfast in Britain, and found that the working class communities have \"closeknit\" social networks in common. The networks are of high density and multiplex 7 . It has been shown that individuals vary in their degrees of integration into the community; some have very few links with people outside their social group, while some have fewer links within the group but more links with the outside. Studies have shown quantitatively that the individual speakers' linguistic behaviors are highly correlated with their degrees of integration into the network: in the situation when linguistic variations are present in the community, the more integrated one individual is into the community, the less variation he has, and the better he conforms to the speech norm of the community.",

            "text": "First of all, in the deterministic model given by Equation (1), the innovation always diffuses. However, in reality, while linguistic innovations arise frequently in the speech community, only a small number of them are successful in leading to a change. There is a \"threshold problem\" for successful changes (Nettle 1999a,c) : why a new linguistic variant, initially rare, can win over the previous linguistic norm? In biological and cultural evolution, when a new mutant trait arises in an individual, it has a good chance to be passed on to that individual's offspring, as long as the mutant is not severely deleterious or actually lethal. Some genetic mutations can successfully diffuse into the whole population without natural selection (Kimura 1983). But linguistic transmission is different from genetic transmission. Instead of inheriting genes from one or two parents, a language learner samples at least a proportion of the language community, which may include a fairly large number of people in the generations above him as well as in his peer group. The mutant who arises in the last generation will be the minority and unlikely be learned by the next generation. \"All plausible learning algorithms lead, other things being equal, to the adoption of the most common variant in the sample for a given item, which will never be the new mutant\" (Nettle 1999c: 98) . Therefore, new mutants cannot become the fixed norm in a language community unless \"they can pass a threshold of frequency which in the early stages they never have\" (ibid). Nettle (1999a, c) suggests that there are two possibilities for the innovation to overcome the threshold. One is functional selection, i.e., there is a functional bias toward the innovation over the original norm. Studies on language universals and language evolution have proposed various functional accounts, such as perceptual salience, production economy, markedness, iconicity, etc. (Croft 1990 , Kirby 1999 . The other possibility to cross the threshold for change is \"social selection\", in which the innovation originates from some influential speakers who have higher influence, or \"social impact\", than others and learners may favor learning from them. Nettle's model is an adapted version of the Social Impact Theory which simulates attitude change in social groups (Nowak et al. 1990 ). The population is structured with age and social status. The language learner chooses one of the competing linguistic variants by evaluating their impact after sampling the speech of individuals in the community. Individuals within shorter social distance or with higher social status have a higher impact on the learner.",

Concluding from these results from the simulation, Nettle suggests that functional biases may affect the direction of language change, but cannot provide a sufficient condition for change to happen.

In the earlier model, only one pair of agents interact in each time step. This becomes unrealistic if we interpret the time step in the model in terms of age stage. If we divide the life span into five age stages, one age stage is approximately 15 years. Within one stage, each agent should have a large number of interactions with other agents they have connections with. In the following, for the sake of simplicity, we will set a fixed number of interactions for each agent. Figure 11 shows the diffusion dynamics for different connection densities (D), adults' probabilities of change (\u03b1 adult ) and children's probabilities of change (\u03b1 child ). The connection density D not only affects the rate of diffusion, as shown in Figure 9 , but also affects the shape of the diffusion curve. When D is large (D=0.5 in Figure 11 (a) and (b)), the diffusion is highly rapid in a nonlinear way. When D becomes smaller, the curve becomes more linear (compared Figure 11(b) and (c)).",

When \u03b1 child is too small (0.05), the innovation does not always diffuse; sometimes it fails. As shown in Figure 10 (e), in 6 out of 10 runs the innovation dies out (they show no trace in the graph), and in the 4 runs where the innovation spreads, it does not reach the whole community -there is a relatively constant proportion of the population (10% as in Figure 11 (e)) which keeps the original norm. This incomplete diffusion is interesting and unexpected. A similar phenomenon is found in simulation studies of change of attitudes as well, where incomplete polarization of opinions reaches a stable equilibrium (Nowak et al. 1990 ). However, we consider this is an artifact of the children's low learning probability and the regular network structure under the current implementation of the learning process. We will see that this incomplete diffusion does not exist in another implementation of the learning process in the next section. Figure 11 (e) also illustrates the non-deterministic nature of language change: starting from the same network and agents with the same probability to change, in some runs the diffusion is successful while in others it is not. The randomness is due to the different origin of the innovation (whether agents at stage 3, 4 or 5 -children are assumed not to innovate here), and the fact that agents change in a probabilistic manner. The small differences in the early stage of the diffusion may accumulate and amplify, and finally result in qualitative differences in the long run -some innovations reach the whole population while some disappear after just a few steps.",

A smaller \u03b1 adult only makes the diffusion slower (Figure 11 (c) and (d)). As a comparison, when \u03b1 child is small, even though \u03b1 adult is high, the innovation can only spread to half of the population and be stabilized at that level (Figure 11 (f)) (similar to Figure 11 (e), the stabilization in the middle is due to the regular network structure. We will see different outcome in other types of networks later). This suggests that if an innovation is more learnable than the original norm for children, then the innovation is very likely to spread to the whole population and become a new norm, no matter whether adults change or not. Therefore, those language changes, such as the loss of final consonants, which are prone to happen in language acquisition, are more frequently attested. On the contrary, forms which are difficult for children to learn are unlikely to lead to a complete change. The latter part of the conclusions, however, may find difficulties in explaining changes which do seem to be more difficult than earlier norms; models which adopt different social networks discussed in later sections will modify this conclusion.

Though people are more likely to connect to their family members, local neighbors, colleagues, and so on, they also have long-distance connections such as relatives, friends, or business partners living in other places, or in very different socioeconomic classes of the society. Moreover, people do not have the exact same number of links; some may have more than others. At the same time, real social networks are not like random networks either, as most people would have more local regular connections than distant connections. Recently, it has been found that large-scale social networks exhibit the small-world characteristics (i.e. small characteristic path length and high clustering coefficient), such as in a collaboration network of film actors (Watts & Strogatz 1998) , and scale-free characteristics (i.e. a power-law degree distribution), such as in a romantic relationship network (Liljeros et al. 2001 ). There have been various ways to construct networks to exhibit these two features (Dorogovtsev & Mendes 2002 , Newman 2003 Barab\u00e1si & Albert 2003) . There are some models proposed specifically for social networks in order to capture another important feature in social networks: the presence of sub-communities, i.e. clusters (Jin et al. 2001) . However, as a preliminary attempt, in this section, we will only study the two classic ones which were proposed at the time of the discovery of small-world and scale-free characteristics.",

While empirical analyses have shown that some social networks exhibit small-world properties, and some others exhibit scale-free features, so far there has been no welldeveloped model which can incorporate both features. The model also needs to incorporate the coexistence of local and distant links, and the age structure.",

If both forms, i.e., U and C, are present in the learning environment, the leaner compares the cumulative impacts of the two variants and chooses the one which has the higher value. This is similar to the implementation in Nettle's model. However, Nettle's model simulates a weighted fully connected regular network which we consider unrealistic: the learner is assumed to be able to have contact with the whole population, and teachers' impacts are weighted according to a quadratic or even higher power function with respect to the distance. Furthermore, in the above models, how the children acquire the innovation is dependent on a probability of change \u03b1 child . In fact, \u03b1 child is not a very appropriate term, considering the fact that a child's learning of the innovation is different from an adult's: whereas the adult has to give up a form in use and adopt a new form, the child starts from scratch and there is nothing for him to change at the beginning. An adult's change is mostly determined by his sensitivity to the innovation and willingness to change; in contrast, which form a child acquires is determined by the form's learnability in comparison with its competitor, and also the frequency of the two forms.",

The functional value for a linguistic item can be considered as a composite abstract index of the form in terms of production ease, perception salience, simplicity and generality of the activated grammatical rules, and so on.

            "text": "It is obvious that when the functional bias is smaller than 1 (\u03b2<1), i.e. the innovation C has a smaller functional value than U, there is no chance for the innovation to spread when it starts in a rare minority. Then, how large should the functional bias \u03b2 be in order to \"beat\" the original norm and become a new norm? In the following we will examine the effect of \u03b2 on diffusion success and diffusion rate in different types of networks. To make the diffusion easier, we set the number of innovators to be 10, instead of 1 in earlier simulations. The initial conditions are as follows: population size N=400, average degree <k>=20, adults rarely change (\u03b1 adult =0.001). Figure 15 shows the diffusion dynamics in the four types of network when the functional bias \u03b2=10. Regular networks and small-world networks show similar gradual diffusion, while random network and scale-free network still exhibit the rapid diffusion. The diffusion always completes, reaching the whole population, as long as the functional bias is strong enough. The incomplete diffusion, which happens in the model of regular network discussed in Section 3.3, does not exist in the current model when a more realistic learning process is implemented. 12 Functional values f(C) and f(U) correspond to the \"acquisition bias\" used in Nettle (1999a) . 13 Here is one example of innovation having a higher functional value. It is the serial names for SARS during its outbreak in 2003 in the Chinese mass media. At the beginning the name was a complete translation of the technical term in English: \"\u7d27\u6025\u4e25\u91cd\u547c\u5438\u9053\u75be\u75c5\u75c7\u4faf\u7fa4\" (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome), but this name was quickly overcome by a more common name \"\u975e\u5178\u578b\u80ba\u708e\" (Atypical Pneumonia); this term was then further shortened as \u975e\u5178\u80ba and later \u975e\u5178 in mainland China, or \u6c99\u58eb (from the English abbreviation SARS) in other Chinese communities such as Hong Kong. Obviously, the shorter names are assumed to have a higher functional value over the proceeding longer ones, while the last two bi-syllabic words, \u975e\u5178 and \u6c99\u58eb, are of similar functional values, and got chosen by different communities by chance. Figure 16 gives the probability of successful diffusion over 100 runs for different functional biases. We can see that for a range of small functional biases (\u03b2=3~7), regular and small-world networks have higher probabilities of successful diffusion than scale-free and random networks (Figure 16(a) ). In other words, the second two types of networks have a higher threshold of functional bias for successful diffusion. But the second two types of networks take much less time to complete the diffusion than the first two, as shown by average diffusion time over 100 runs in Figure 16 When either the functional bias (\u03b2) or the number of innovators (I) is high, there are little differences between the four types of networks. However, in most cases of the real world, innovations do not have very high functional biases, sometime even no bias; also they often only occur in a small number of innovators except for massive contact situations. For a range of small functional bias and small number of innovators, as shown in Figure 16 , \u03b2\u2208 [4, 8] , the four types of networks show different characteristics: the dynamics in small-world networks is similar to that in regular networks: high success probability, but slow diffusion rate. Scale-free networks are similar to random networks: fast diffusion rate, but lower success probability. Though the range of functional bias to show the differences may still be unrealistically high, and the differences between the two types of networks may not be significant, it is worthwhile to explore the potential differences of these types of networks.",

And the model allows manipulations of several parameters, for example, the degree of connectivity, the learnability of the innovation, the overall structure of networks, etc., to study their effect on the diffusion dynamics. This process of refining the model gives a demonstration of how a computational model for language change can be developed and explored.",

Or is it necessary to develop a new type of network model which can incorporate both the small-world and scale-free features?

The model will be useful in carrying out controlled experiments on manipulating various conditions, such as the ratios of population size between two groups in contact, contact intensity and duration, the presence of differentiated social status, etc. It will be interesting to see if the model can predict such two kinds of different outcomes, and compare them with the empirical data.",

The controversy may be resolved by running simulations of different conditions where innovation arise from the two types of speakers (center or marginal members), and compare the success rates of diffusion in these conditions. Our earlier simulation has shown that when an agent with a large number of connections adopts the innovation, the diffusion starts to pick up speed and spread very quickly into the population ).

            "text": "A brief glossary to some simple measures of network properties 15 :Measures of the individual nodes:\u2022 degree (k i ) : the number of links the node i has. Nodes with a large number of links are considered as \"hubs\" in an undirected network, or \"hubs\" and \"authorities\" in a directed network. \u2022 distance (d ij ) between node i to node j : the number of links along the shortest path to connect the two nodes. If two nodes are very distant from each other, it needs go through a large number of intermediate nodes and links. \u2022 clustering coefficient (C i ) : measures how well a node's neighbors are connected to each other. If a node has a high C, it means the node is within a cluster with dense links. \u2022 centrality (g i ) : often measured as the betweenness centrality, which counts how many shortest paths go through the node. The nodes having a high centrality usually exist as connectors between clusters in the network.Measures of the global statistical properties of the whole network:\u2022 connectivity: the average degree of the nodes <k>. It is one indicator of the density of the network's connection. Usually real-world networks are sparse, which means the average number of links per node is typically smaller than the total number of nodes in the network. \u2022 degree distribution: the statistical distribution of the degrees of the nodes. Usually it is plotted as a histogram or extrapolated as a distribution function P(k). It gives an idea of the homogeneity and scaling properties of a network. Regular networks are homogeneous as the degrees of all nodes are the same, and its P(k) is a delta function shown as a single spike in the histogram. Typical random networks are found to follow a Poisson distribution. Scale-free networks show a power-law degree distribution. \u2022 characteristic path length (also called average path length, L): the average shortest distance between any two nodes. This gives an idea of the effective size of the network. For regular networks, L increases linearly with respect to the size of the network. On the contrary, in random networks, the distance between any two nodes is small even the network is of huge size; L increases logarithmically, rather than linearly, when the network size increases. Small-world and scale free networks share this feature with random networks. \u2022 clustering coefficient (C): the average clustering coefficient of all nodes. Random networks have a small C, and tend to zero in the limit of large network size. On the contrary, regular networks and small-world networks are highly clustered compared to random networks.\u2022 assortativeness (\u0393): how likely nodes of similar characteristics are connected to each other. A network is said to show assortative mixing if the nodes which have many links tend to be connected to other nodes with many links. The opposite is called disassortative mixing. 15 The actual implementation of the measure for these properties involves many detailed considerations. More rigorous definitions and discussions on various implementations of the above measures can be found in Newman (2003) .",
