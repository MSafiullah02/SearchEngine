These restrictions were imposed as a collective population response to the presence of COVID-19 in communities. However, lifting restrictions is also a population response to their socio-economic impacts, and is expected to increase COVID-19 cases, in turn. This suggests that the COVID-19 pandemic exemplifies a coupled behaviour-disease system. Here we develop a minimal mathematical model of the interaction between social support for school and workplace closure and the transmission dynamics of SARS-CoV-2. We find that a second wave of COVID-19 occurs across a broad range of plausible model input parameters, on account of instabilities generated by behaviour-disease interactions. We conclude that second waves of COVID-19-should they materialize-can be interpreted as the outcomes of nonlinear interactions between disease dynamics and population behaviour.",

Mathematical models of COVID-19 transmission and control show that physical distancing can mitigate the pandemic [24, 37, 44] and this has subsequently been backed up by empirical analyses of case notification data. These analyses show how mitigation measures have reduced the effective reproduction number of SARS-CoV-2 below one, meaning that each infected case infects less than one person on average [3, 8, 32] . However, the population's willingness to support school and workplace closures could wane over time, as the economic costs of closure accumulate [6] . This has given rise to the possibility of a second wave of COVID-19 in many populations.",

We opted for a simple model that avoids heterogeneities because our objective is to gain insights into potential interactions between social and behavioural dynamics. Public opinion evolves according to social learning rules [4, 43] , and public opinion in support of closure depends both on COVID-19 case incidence and accumulated socio-economic losses due to school and workplace closure. A central decision-maker chooses a time to initially close schools and workplaces when the outbreak begins, but may subsequently open and close them again depending on how public opinion ebbs and flows. Meanwhile, disease dynamics are described by a compartmental epidemic model [18] . The details of our mathematical model are described in the Methods section. We analyze the model to characterize the conditions that give rise to a second wave of COVID-19 in the population.",

After this, infection prevalence peaks and begins to decline. Support remains at a high plateau for a period of two months, after which support for closure wanes, causing restrictions to be lifted by t = 160 days. Shortly thereafter, prevalence begins to rise again. Support for closure correspondingly rises again, but not quickly enough to prevent a second wave of COVID-19 with a peak at t = 240 days that is higher than the peak of the first wave.",

Higher values of \u03ba indicate that individuals imitate more quickly. At our baseline value \u03ba = 5/day, we observe a second wave. As the value of \u03ba increases from this baseline value, the number of waves increases from two to six or seven in all three parameter planes, unless the effectiveness of closure (C 0 ) is so low that the population experiences a single large epidemic that rapidly confers herd immunity to everyone (Figures 3-5). As \u03ba is reduced sufficiently from its baseline value, the second wave is lost as expected, since we enter a parameter regime where the population responds with an unrealistic slowness to the presence of COVID-19, and it experiences a single, rapid pandemic wave that rapidly confers herd immunity.

For instance, our model assumes that populations respond to infection prevalence I(t) but in fact, populations observe reported cases and deaths, both of which are delayed compared to time of actual infection. Time delays tend to destabilize dynamics in epidemic models [2] and hence we suspect that a model extension including a response to lagged outcomes like reported cases and deaths would exacerbate the severity of second waves in our model.",

Similarly, on the behavioural modelling side, we suggest that the extreme oscillations observed in this model could also be stabilized if individuals use past and/or projected future states in their decision-making, instead of just the current prevalence, as we assumed [7, 47] . Alternatively, if individuals learn socially from other populations at differing stages of COVID-19 outbreaks [42] , and not just their local population, this might also dampen the oscillations we observed in the model.",

Moreover, our prediction of a second wave was relatively robust across parameter space. Hence, we conclude that a second wave of COVID-19 on account of the coupled behaviour-diseases feedbacks we explore in this model will characterize many populations. We also conclude that that more effort in transmission modelling of COVID-19 should consider the effect of interactions between the dynamics of disease spread and social processes.",

Moreover, the infectious stages is preceded by a latent stage in which the virus is still replicating inside its new host until it can reach a level where the host can transmit the infection to others.

While \u03ba dictates how quickly novel social behaviour spreads through a population, dictates how sensitive the population is to changes in case reports relative to socio-economic losses. \u03ba can be estimated from behaviour early in the epidemic when socio-economic losses are small as dx/dt \u2248 \u03bax(1 \u2212 x)I. For I(t) we used reports of confirmed positive cases from the early stages of the United States epidemic, adjusted by a case under-ascertainment factor of 8.7 in the United States [26] in order to estimate the true prevalence of infections I(t) in the model. We used 21 January 2020 as the initial date of the epidemic, when the first case of COVID-19 was reported in the United States. Most populations rapidly adopted physical distancing measures against COVID-19. Gallup polls indicate that 59%/79%/92% of the United States public avoided going to events with large crowds, as of 13-15 March/16-18 March/20-22 March 2020 respectively [40] . Similarly, 30%/54%/72% avoided public places, and 23%/46%/68% avoided small gatherings [40] . Taking the average of these responses across the three question types, we obtain that x(52) = 0.373, x(59) = 0.597, x(66) = 0.773 where time is measured in days since January 21. Finally, we shifted these points forward 14 days as physical distancing at time t will not be reflected in infection data until t + 14 due to the delays in testing and symptom recognition. We assumed x(0) = 0.25 when fitting to these three data points using least-squares minimization for the \u03ba calibration. Accordingly, we fit the model to the number of cases in the United States (SI Appendix: Figure 1b) . The fitted infection trajectory is in good agreement with reported cases in the US during the initial phase of the epidemic leading up to 4 April 2020. For the special case where there is an absence of any control measures, the model predicts that about 80% of the population becomes infected by the end of the outbreak (SI Appendix: Figure 1a ).",

The epidemic curve for different values of the closure efficacy C 0 is shown, ranging from C 0 = 0 (no intervention) to C 0 = 0.6 (SI Appendix: Figure 1c) . The timeseries show that the epidemic curve is flattened and delayed as closure becomes more efficacious, which reduces peak demand for intensive care beds and buys time for developing pharmaceutical interventions like vaccines and antiviral drugs, improving testing capacity, and establishing novel approaches to patient care. For the remainder of our analysis, to determine C 0 it was assumed that C 0 should be large enough to bring the effective reproduction number R ef f below 1, reflecting the observed success in multiple jurisdictions where physical distancing and closure have maintained R ef f < 1 [3, 8, 32] . Hence we chose C 0 = 1 \u2212 1/R 0 based on the elimination threshold for the SEIR model [18] . We also assumed t close = 20 days but in practice, our second requirement that x \u2265 50% was not reached until after 20 days in all of the model simulations.",
