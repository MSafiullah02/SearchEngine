The more severe forms of HFRS are caused by Hantaan virus (HTNV) in Asia and Dobrava virus (DOBV) in Europe, with reported mortalities of 5\u201312%, while Seoul virus (SEOV) is reported to cause an intermediate form, predominantly occurring in Asia and with a mortality of around 1% [1]. Puumala virus (PUUV) causes a milder form of HFRS in Europe, with less than 0.2% mortality [2]. Sin Nombre virus (SNV), Andes virus (ANDV), and related viruses cause HCPS in the Americas; these infections are associated with a mortality rate of around 40% [2], [3]. Other hantaviruses, like Tula virus (TULV), circulating in large areas of Europe, and Topografov virus (TOPV), have never been clearly associated with human disease.",

Interestingly, there seem to be clear differences in terms of pathogenicity for humans after DOBV and SAAV infections. The most severe HFRS cases, with high fatality rates, have been reported from the Balkans, where DOBV is dominant [7], [8], [9]. In contrast, in parts of Europe where SAAV dominates, no fatalities associated with DOBV-like viruses have been registered [2], [10], [11], [12], [13]. One prominent example is the large DOBV-like associated outbreak in central Russia in 1991\u20131992, when 130 HFRS patients were hospitalised, but no fatal cases occurred [10]. Taken together, those reports suggest that SAAV induces a disease more similar to PUUV than to DOBV infection [2].",

            "text": "Today, little is known regarding the mechanisms behind hantavirus pathogenesis, but immune mechanisms have been suggested to be involved in HFRS and HCPS pathogenesis [14]. Hantavirus infection per se does not directly damage endothelial cells in vitro [15], and specific immune responses are present at the onset of the symptomatic phase of the disease. In SNV-infected patients there is a correlation between a high frequency of SNV-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes and severe disease, and these cytotoxic T lymphocytes are suggested to contribute to the disease [16]. Furthermore, histological studies of postmortem tissues show blood mononuclear cell infiltration that might play a role in functional organ failure [17], [18], [19]. Elevated levels of cytokines like IL-6, IL-10 and TNF-\u03b1 have been reported, and elevated production of the free radical nitric oxide (NO) has been detected in hantavirus infected patients [20], [21], [22], as well as in monkeys infected with PUUV [23], indicating that it may contribute to hantavirus pathogenesis [22]. SNV infection of deer mice, the natural host, does not induce elevated NO production [22]. NO is known to contribute to the pathogenesis of certain virus infections in mice, like influenza virus [24] and neurotropic viruses [25], but NO is also known to have antiviral effects against some viruses, including ectromelia virus (mousepox), coxsackievirus, herpesviruses and SARS coronavirus [26], [27].",

The results thus showed that the viral titers were at least 50% lower at day 18 after SAAV infection as compared to the titers in the DOBV-infected mice that died between days 18 and 20 after infection.",

Another possible mediator of the pathogenesis could be NO, earlier shown to be involved in the pathogenesis of neurotropic viruses in mice [25]. We indirectly measured the levels of NO in the brains of the suckling mice by measuring the level of nitrite, after conversion of nitrate to nitrite. In this experiment, we also included a group of suckling mice inoculated with inactivated DOBV (corresponding to 5000 FFU) that was sacrificed at day 18 after inoculation, as control. Similar mean values of nitrite were detected in all groups, except in the group of suckling mice that died following DOBV infection (\nTable 4). Significant differences between the mean levels of NO in the groups were found (Kruskal\u2013Wallis test, P\n = 0.014). High levels of nitrite were only detected in the DOBV-infected mice that died following infection with 5000 FFU of DOBV, but not in those that died after infection with 50 or 500 FFU of DOBV (\nFig. 1), suggesting that the NO production was dose-dependent, or that the levels in the other lethally infected mice had returned to normal before they died.",

All mice inoculated with 8000 FFU of DOBV died (\nFig. 2). To evaluate if a higher dose of SAAV would be lethal, undiluted SAAV (corresponding to 10,000 FFU) was inoculated into eight mice; however, none of the mice died or showed any symptoms (Fig. 2), clearly showing that SAAV was not lethal for suckling mice. PUUV esc-5A2 (20,000 FFU) and PUUV Kazan-wt (200 bank vole ID50) were inoculated into eight mice per group, and five mice were inoculated with PUUV Sot (5000 FFU). None of the mice inoculated with PUUV died, or showed any symptoms within 23\u201325 days after inoculation (Fig. 2). The same pattern was seen for TOPV and TULV: of eight mice inoculated with undiluted TOPV (900 FFU) or TULV (1,800 FFU) none died or showed any symptoms within 23 and 36 days after inoculation, respectively (Fig. 2). Infection of suckling mice with HTNV (100 FFU) was lethal for all eight inoculated mice (Fig. 2); all died within 15 days after infection. Infection with SEOV (18,000 FFU) was lethal for 25% of infected mice (n\n = 8) within 19 days of infection; the surviving mice showed no symptoms for the 29-day-long experiment (Fig. 2).",

Although wild-trapped Mus musculus have been reported to be antibody positive against hantaviruses, no specific hantavirus has been proven to use feral mice as its primary host for replication, indicating that infection of feral mice is due to spillover events. Similar to the natural hosts, hantavirus infections of adult mice are normally asymptomatic, but in contrast to the natural host, and similar to findings in man, mice effectively clear the virus infection. It is currently not known why infection of the natural hosts is asymptomatic, or why infection of man results in severe disease, and although immune mediated mechanisms have been suggested to cause the diseases in man [14], this remains to be clearly shown.",

This indicates that they died rather early after a specific immune response was mounted. The level of lethality, as well as time to death, correlated with the amount of DOBV given: the more the virus, the higher the degree of lethality. However, although all mice in the group given 5000 FFU of DOBV were infected, the pattern observed for lethality was not observed for infection, as approximately half of the mice in both of the groups given 50 or 500 FFU became infected. For SAAV, all inoculated mice seroconverted, showing that all were infected, and replicating virus or viral RNA could also be detected in most of the mice at the time of sacrifice (day 34 after infection). When suckling mice inoculated with 5000 FFU of SAAV were sacrificed at day 18 after infection, higher virus titers were detected as compared to day 34; however, the titers were at least 50% lower than for the mice inoculated with DOBV that died between days 18 and 20. Thus, it seems that a low dose of SAAV can more readily infect suckling mice than DOBV, while DOBV replicates to higher titers after a successful infection. The data further indicate that some mice were not successfully infected by DOBV, as evident by the lack of replicating virus, viral RNA and specific antibody responses.",

Interestingly, only mice that died following DOBV inoculation showed elevated levels of nitrite as compared to all other groups, including mice inoculated with 5000 FFU of SAAV and sacrificed at day 18 after infection. However, the highest level of nitrate was detected in mice given 5000 FFU of DOBV, the three mice that died following infection with 500 or 50 FFU of DOBV showed similar levels of nitrite as controls, suggesting that the peak of NO production occurs before or around day 18, or that NO production was not increased in those mice.",

It was recently shown that SNV infection of the natural host (the deer mice), does not induce elevated levels of NO production [22]. In line with the results of Davis et al. we could not detect systemically elevated NO levels in adult mice asymptomatically infected with HTNV. Furthermore, no replicating virus was detected in iNOS\u2212/\u2212 mice 3 weeks after HTNV infection, suggesting that virus clearance in mice is not dependent on NO. Moreover, as elevated levels of NO were only detected in suckling mice that succumbed to DOBV infection, and not in any asymptomatically infected suckling or adult mice, our results are in line with the reports of elevated levels of NO production in HFRS/HCPS-patients [20], [21], [22], indicating that NO may be involved in hantavirus pathogenesis and that the increased NO production is caused by the immune response, and not by the virus per se. However, the possible role of NO in hantavirus pathogenesis in man, and the mechanisms leading to elevated levels of NO, remain to be shown.",

There is an intriguing connection between the Th-type of immune response and iNOS, the enzyme that produces the vast majority of NO during viral infection. During Th1-type immune responses IFN-\u03b3 is produced, which leads to the induction of iNOS, whereas a Th2-type of immune response down-regulates iNOS induction [62].

The level of replicating virus and/or induction of NO production, probably in combination with the Th-type of immune response mounted, may in part explain why only DOBV is lethal. We believe that future studies addressing the effect of NO on the pathogenesis of hantavirus infections in suckling mice and HFRS/HCPS-patients, and why the NO production is increased in patients, could provide insight into some of the mechanisms behind hantavirus pathogenesis.",
