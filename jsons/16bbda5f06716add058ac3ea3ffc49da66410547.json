Following induction, recombinant nucleoproteins truncated at the C-terminus by 9, 18 and 27 amino acids were expressed at similar levels and appeared in gels as 16, 14.5, and 13.5 kDa bands, respectively (Fig. 4a) . The significant reduction in M r (5 kDa) following removal of the C-terminal 9 amino acids confirms that this short highly acidic domain is the primary cause of the difference between the observed M r and deduced molecular weight of the fulllength nucleoprotein. Immunoblot analysis indicated each truncated nucleoprotein segment reacted with YHV polyclonal antiserum (Figs. 1b and 4b ). In the 27-truncated protein, a second minor 14.5 kDa band detected by SDS-PAGE following induction also reacted strongly with the polyclonal antiserum. The origin of this band is not yet determined but monoclonal antibody reactions (see below) indicate that it also includes the 27 truncation. Monoclonal antibodies Y19 and YII4 reacted with each of the 9-and 18-truncated nucleoproteins but not the 27-truncated protein, indicating the epitopes are located either within the deleted E 129 -E 137 segment or span the point of trun- cation (Figs. 1b and 4d and f).

Key criteria for the taxonomic placement of YHV and closely related Gill-associated virus (GAV) are the existence of a (+) ssRNA genome containing two overlapping long openreading-frames (ORF1a and ORF1b) that are aligned during translation by a \u22121 ribosomal frame-shift, and a characteristic 'SDD' motif in the active site of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Cowley et al., 2000; Sittidilokratna et al., 2002) . It has also been reported that the GAV genome is transcribed as a nested set of 3 -coterminal sub-genomic mRNAs . However, unlike the known vertebrate nidoviruses (coronaviruses, toroviruses and arteriviruses), the GAV nucleoprotein gene (ORF2) is located upstream, rather than downstream, of the glycoprotein gene (Cowley et al., 2004) . In this paper, we confirm that the YHV nucleocapsid protein (p20) is also encoded in ORF2 which immediately precedes the gene encoding the transmembrane glycoproteins gp116 and gp64 (i.e. ORF3) (Jitrapakdee et al., 2003) . The function of the YHV ORF2 gene is evident from the deduced amino acid sequence, which shares a high level identity (84%) with the GAV nucleoprotein. It is also demonstrated by the reaction of the E. coli-expressed recombinant ORF2 protein with YHV monoclonal antibody Y19 which is known to be specific for virion structural protein p20 (Sithigorngul et al., 2002) , the only known polypeptide component of YHV nucleocapsids (Soowannayan et al., 2003) . The unusual location of the YHV and GAV nucleoprotein genes may be a consequence of genetic recombination in an ancestral nidovirus. High-frequency genetic recombination is known to occur commonly in (+) ssRNA viruses, including nidoviruses (Lai et al., 1985; van der Most and Spaan, 1995; Snijder et al., 1991; Lai, 1992) , and it has been proposed that the diverse structural and morphological characteristics of nidoviruses may have occurred by a modular evolutionary process that results in exchange by recombination of complete genes or gene sets Horzinek, 1993, 1995; Snijder and Spaan, 1995) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 114, "end": 135, "text": "(Walker et al., 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 498, "end": 519, "text": "(Cowley et al., 2000;", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 520, "end": 549, "text": "Sittidilokratna et al., 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 867, "end": 888, "text": "(Cowley et al., 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1085, "end": 1111, "text": "(Jitrapakdee et al., 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1453, "end": 1480, "text": "(Sithigorngul et al., 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1541, "end": 1567, "text": "(Soowannayan et al., 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1811, "end": 1829, "text": "(Lai et al., 1985;", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1830, "end": 1859, "text": "van der Most and Spaan, 1995;", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1860, "end": 1881, "text": "Snijder et al., 1991;", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1882, "end": 1892, "text": "Lai, 1992)", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 2122, "end": 2143, "text": "Horzinek, 1993, 1995;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2144, "end": 2168, "text": "Snijder and Spaan, 1995)", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "There is a significant difference between the molecular weight of the YHV nucleocapsid protein predicted from the deduced amino acid sequence (M.W. = 16.6 kDa) and the observed electrophoretic mobility of the virion nucleoprotein by SDS-PAGE (M r \u223c20 kDa). The deduced sequence indicates several unusual structural features that may contribute to aberrant migration in gels including a relatively high proportion of proline and glycine residues and a highly polar arrangement of charged residues. The discrepancy between predicted size and electrophoretic mobility is also evident in the His 6 -tagged full-length recombinant protein expressed in E. coli (Fig. 2) . It was also observed that the expressed GST-fusion proteins containing the C-terminal half (Q 74 -S 146 ) and the CC quadrant (R 110 -S 146 ) of the nucleoprotein were retarded relative to the migration of fusion proteins containing other segments of similar size (Fig. 3) .

Y19 and YII4 were derived from different cell fusions. Each reacts with both YHV and GAV and so must target highly conserved sequences comprising the 6-7 amino acids of a linear B cell epitope. This identifies the sequence IVPDPSL spanning the point of truncation as the only possible epitope for Y19 and YII4 (Fig. 1b) . Monoclonal antibody Y20 is specific for YHV and so must target a 6-7 amino acid sequence that is not identical in GAV either within the deleted E 129 -E 137 segment or the upstream region spanning the point of truncation (Fig. 1b) .
