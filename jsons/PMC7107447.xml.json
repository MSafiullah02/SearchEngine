The cultures were macroscopically and microscopically examined for the absence of bacteria and fungi after incubation for 2 wk at 37\u00b0C and room temperature. Feces were microscopically examined after gram-staining. The serological methods of the FELASA health monitoring recommendations were applied to verify the absence of rat-specific viruses, bacteria, and protozoa (Kraft et al. 1994). No antigens of coronavirus of the rat, reovirus typ 3, Theiler's murine encephalomyelitisvirus, pneumoniavirus of the mouse, Sendai virus, Kilham rat virus, Toolan H-1 virus, Clostridium piliforme, Mycoplasma pulmonis, M. arthritidis, Pasteurella pneumotropica, and Toxoplasma gondii could be detected by specific antibodies.

They were fed an irradiated pelleted diet (25 kGy) consisting of a commercial rat-breeding diet (Altromin fortified\u00ae type 1311; Altromin, Lage, Germany) with the following composition: crude protein (225 g/kg), crude fat (50 g/kg), crude fiber (45 g/kg), ash (65 g/kg), moisture (135 g/kg) and nitrogen-free extract (480 g/kg). The diet was supplemented with 60 g of sunflower-seed oil (Br\u00f6lio, Hamm, Germany), 20 mg BHT as an antioxidant (Sigma, Deisenhofen, Germany), and 7.5 g of CaCO3 per kg diet, resulting in 110 g of fat and 12 g of calcium/kg diet. The diet was stored at room temperature. Rats were maintained in positive-pressure isolators (Metall & Plastik, Radolfzell, Germany) and housed individually in polycarbonate cages on irradiated wood chips at 22 \u00b1 2\u00b0C, 55 \u00b1 5% relative humidity on a 12-h light-dark cycle (0700\u20131900). They had free access to diet and autoclaved distilled water. Coprophagy was not prevented. Diet samples were taken once per week from the isolators and analyzed for total fat and CLA (see below). In one group, six rats were inoculated intragastrically on two successive days with a CLA-producing mixed bacterial culture by intragastric application.

Filter-sterilized LA was added to a final concentration of 4 mmol/L, and the cultures were shaken at 37\u00b0C. Media without inoculum served as controls. Since the media were turbid due to the addition of LA, microbial growth was monitored by light microscopy. CLA production was measured as follows: The cultures were vigorously shaken, then 1-mL samples were subjected to lipid extraction with 5 mL of chloroform/methanol (2:1). After centrifugation at 1600 \u00d7 g for 15 min at 4\u00b0C, a 3-mL aliquot of the chloroform layer was dried in a rotoevaporator at 4\u00b0C (Jouan, Saint-Herblain, France). The samples were dissolved in 0.5 mL of HPLC-grade acetonitrile and analyzed for LA and CLA using an HPLC system (Gynkotek, Munich, Germany) equipped with a nucleosil C18 reversed-phase column (250 \u00d7 4.6 mm, 5 \u03bcm particle size; Bischoff Chromatography, Leonberg, Germany) and a precolumn (type K1, 16 \u00d7 4.6 mm; Bischoff Chromatography). Samples of 10 \u03bcL were injected by an automatic injection system (GINA, Gynkotek). An isocratic mobile phase of 16.15 mol/L acetonitrile with 16.4 mmol/L acetic acid was pumped at a flow rate of 2 mL/min at 25\u00b0C over the column for 12 min per sample. Samples exceeding the calibration range were diluted 10- to 50-fold with acetonitrile prior to injection. The retention times of LA and CLA were between 6.9 and 7.3 min. LA and CLA were identified by diode-array detection (234 nm for CLA and 205 nm for LA). Calibration was performed by injecting purified CLA and LA (Sigma).",

Tubes were weighed again to determine the amount of total fat extracted. Triacylglycerol in serum was quantified enzymatically with glycerol phosphate oxidase with a test kit (No 336; Sigma). To liberate the fatty acids, the fat extracted from tissues, serum and diet samples was hydrolyzed by addition of 2 mL 1 mol/L of NaOH in methanol and incubation for 15 min in a boiling water bath. One milliliter 5.5 mol/L H2SO4 was added to neutralize the NaOH. Free fatty acids were extracted twice with 5 mL hexane. Hexane layers were pooled and evaporated to dryness (see above). Fatty acids were dissolved in 1 mL of acetonitrile and subjected to quantification of LA and CLA by HPLC (see above). In feces and cecum and colon contents, only free CLA and LA were determined.",

Values for free CLA and for total (free plus esterified) CLA did not differ significantly either in the germ-free or in the associated rats (data not shown).",

            "text": "The importance of the intestinal microorganisms to the supply of the host with the anticarcinogen CLA was investigated. It has already been shown (Chin et al. 1994) that free LA, but not corn oil, in the diet of conventional rats leads to an accumulation of CLA in the tissues, whereas the CLA concentration of tissues from germ-free rats is not affected by free LA in the diet. However, in that study (Chin et al. 1994), the germ-free rats were fed a diet different from that fed to the conventional rats. Furthermore, free LA usually is not added to human food but rather, eliminated during industrial processing because of its bad taste. Thus, it is more appropriate to use a diet rich in esterified LA to investigate the intestinal CLA synthesis in animals and humans. A recent study revealed that the daily intake of 16 g esterified LA by humans did not increase the plasma CLA concentrations (Herbel et al. 1998). Our study with germ-free and associated rats, fed a diet rich in esterified LA, confirms these results and also shows very clearly that even the presence of intestinal microorganisms capable of LA-conjugation under in vitro conditions does not necessarily lead to an increase in CLA in serum or tissues under in vivo conditions. This may be due to the inability of the microorganisms investigated to conjugate LA in vivo. This is supported by the fact that the CLA/LA ratio in feces and in cecum or colon contents was not significantly greater in the associated rats compared to the germ-free rats. In this context, it is interesting to note that the LA-conjugating enzyme system acts on free, but not on esterified LA (Kepler and Tove 1969). Moreover, the absence of free CLA in intestinal contents is not due to the incorporation of CLA into bacterial lipids, as was shown by controls. The extracellular location of the free CLA produced by bacteria was recently demonstrated by Jiang et al. (1998).",

            "text": "Sunflower-seed oil was chosen because of the high concentration of LA esterified to glycerol (657 g/kg; Stolper Bloch and Shils 1994). During triacylglycerol digestion, fatty acids in sn-1- and sn-3-positions of the glycerol are preferably hydrolyzed, whereas the fatty acid in the sn-2-position is preferentially absorbed as monoacylglycerol (Renaud 1995). Since 78% of the sn2-positions in oil from sunflower seeds are esterified with LA (personal communication: Dr. Klaus Ragotzky, Unilever, Hamburg, Germany), it can be calculated from the fatty-acid pattern in this oil that 407 g of LA/kg of oil are esterified to the sn-1- or sn-3-positions of the glycerol. This amount is hydrolyzed by the pancreatic lipases and preferably absorbed, but also does enter to some extent the cecum or colon. Calcium supplementation increases fecal fatty acid excretion slightly (Govers et al. 1996, Welberg et al. 1994). In the large intestine, fatty acids are present either in free form or precipitated as Ca2+-salts (Carey et al. 1983). Thus, the calcium concentration of the diet was increased from 9 to 12 g/kg in order to enhance the precipitation of LA with Ca2+ and to increase the proportion of LA reaching the cecum and the colon of the rats. Not surprisingly, we detected free LA and CLA in feces and in cecum and colon contents. Usually, fecal fatty acids in conventional rats are more saturated than in germ-free rats (Eyssen and Parmentier 1974). In our study, we were unable to confirm this observation for the associated rats (data not shown), indicating that the bacterial mixed culture did not reduce the double bonds in unsaturated fatty acids.",

The absorption of fatty acids occurs preferentially in the small intestine (Carey et al. 1983). Absorption of long-chain fatty acids from the colon would be an important prerequisite for CLA formed in the colon to exert any systemic beneficial effects. However, CLA formed in the intestine may still have local effects on the colonic mucous membrane, particularly in humans. In rats, the situation may be different because of coprophagy (Soave and Brand 1991), which makes nutrients formed by the bacterial flora in the cecum or colon available. The fact that coprophagy was not prevented in this study supports the notion that no CLA was synthesized from LA in the large intestine when a diet rich in esterified LA was fed. Coprophagy might be the method of CLA absorption in conventional rats, in which the feeding of a free LA-enriched diet leads to an increase of CLA in the tissues (Chin et al. 1994).",
