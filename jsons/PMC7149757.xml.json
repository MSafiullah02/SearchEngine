While there are viruses that infect many animal, plant, and protist cells and result in effects on the host that range from inapparent infection to lethality, all virus infections have some features in common. These include an entry phase, an intracellular phase consisting of multiplication, integration, or latency formation, a virus release phase, and usually some sort of host responses to the presence of the virus infection. It is often these host responses that appear as the most prominent signs and symptoms of virus infection.",

At the structural level, all viruses have some general features in common: a virus has a core of nucleic acid (either RNA or DNA) that acts as the genome of the virus and encodes some of the biological functions of the particular virus. Also, at the functional level, all viruses share some common processes of interactions with their host cells. While virus classification schemes are still debated among virologists, the nature of the genome and the mode of mRNA synthesis of a given virus are generally useful and widely employed bases for classification. David Baltimore has proposed a scheme based on mRNA metabolism (Figure 2). The chemical structure of the viral genome (DNA vs. RNA, single vs. double strandedness) is also a widely used basis for viral taxonomy (Table 1).\n",

Often, the virus attachment site can be a molecule or group of molecules that the cell uses for other purposes, for example, a protein in the maltose transport system is used by bacteriophage lambda for attachment to Escherichia coli, and one of the lymphocyte cell recognition molecules is used by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) as its cell surface attachment site. In all virus infections the genome of the virus enters the host cell; in some cases only the viral nucleic acid enters the cell, leaving the protein coat of the virus outside of the cell; in other cases, the entire virus is taken into the cell and the genome is exposed after a process of intracellular \u2018uncoating\u2019. In some instances, the viral nucleic acid enters the host cell with one or a very few genome-associated proteins while the bulk of the virus structural proteins remains on the outside of the host cell. Upon entering the cell, or soon thereafter, the infectious virus particles are disrupted, and even if the cell is artificially broken open, no infectious viruses are found. This period between the loss of infectivity and the appearance of fully infectious progeny virus is called the \u2018eclipse\u2019 phase of the virus life cycle.",

In the case of viruses that have evolved to be \u2018virulent\u2019, that is, virus that will replicate and kill the host cell, some of the genes of the virus are expressed immediately and their translation into proteins results in the beginning of the intracellular replication phase of the virus. The usual genetic program of such viruses (e.g., bacteriophage T4, herpes simplex virus) is to direct the synthesis of viral DNA and when there are many copies of the viral genome, then to express the genes for the structural components of the virus, for example, the capsid (coat) proteins, and the envelope proteins, in the case of enveloped viruses. Once a large number of viral genomes have been produced and once a sufficiently large pool of virus structural proteins has accumulated, virus assembly is possible. When a large number of mature virus particles have accumulated, the cell often bursts because of disrupted metabolism or is lysed from within by specific lysis enzymes. This process releases the progeny virus in a \u2018burst\u2019 of hundreds to thousands of new infectious virus particles able to initiate another round of infection. Figure 3 shows in diagrammatic outline the various steps in the infectious cycle of a specific virus, the influenza A virus.\n",

Some viruses, such as the herpes simplex virus, cause local immunological reactions of such intensity that much of the inflammation and pain at the site of the infection is the result of the action of the immune cells rather than the destruction of the infected cells by the virus alone. Another unusual immune reaction is observed in the case of infection by Epstein\u2013Barr virus. This virus enters certain cells of the B-lymphocyte lineage and results in a growth transformation of these cells, providing them with the potential for unlimited cell division (\u2018immortalization\u2019, the first step in the formation of a B-cell malignancy). The normal immune surveillance mechanism that involves the T-lymphocyte system is activated to respond to these transformed B-cells and kill them. The process of T-cell activation gives rise to a large population of unusual T-cells, and it was this population of activated T-cells (large cells with a large nucleus, initially thought to be unusual monocytes) that gave Epstein\u2013Barr virus infection its name: infectious mononucleosis, or \u2018Mono\u2019.
