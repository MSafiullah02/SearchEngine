This institution is instantiated in local geographic sites that are publicly accessible to citizens with specified human needs and are infused with meaning and values associated with normative social purpose. Established theory about public places focuses on the importance of being situated locally in neighborhoods, towns, cities, states, and nations (Francis et al., 2012; Parkinson, 2012). Because places are geographically bounded by their natural and physical location and the buildings and material objects assembled there (Gieryn, 2000), the physicality of places affects the way in which they are resourced to accomplish normative social purposes. Although previous literature on public places has not stressed the characteristic of social inclusiveness, to varying degrees it is inherent to discussions of public access to places such as emergency departments, public schools, libraries, recreational parks, welfare offices, community centers, and courts of law.",

Other places fulfill a social purpose that is sometimes associated with universal access to basic human services (Altman and Zube, 1989; Carr et al., 1992). These studies of public places provide a foundation for considering how some particular places can be established and maintained as places of social inclusion.",

            "text": "Combining the above ideas with concepts from institutional theory conceptualizing institutions as multi-level phenomena (Barley, 2008), we posit that a place of social inclusion is nested across societal and local levels. The societal level captures the regulative and cultural\u2013cognitive elements of a place of social inclusion in the democratic state and the normative values it is expected to accomplish for citizens through meeting specific needs. Depending on the precise nature of these needs, places of social inclusion are embedded in the state and also intersect with other higher-order institutions in society such as the medical, teaching, and legal professions. The local level reflects the specificity of the geographic places in which the institutional values of a place of social inclusion are accomplished. That is, human needs are met at local sites\u2014such as a local emergency department or public school\u2014that are resourced by the state to actualize the institutional value of social inclusion. Because places at the local level are \u201cforever precarious and contested\u201d when they nest within societal-level systems (Gieryn, 2000: 472), a place of social institution is an inherently precarious type of institution.",

            "text": "Two literature streams offer preliminary guidance on how places of social inclusion might be maintained. Geographers and sociologists pursue one stream, focusing on how people interact with a place (Relph, 1976; Lewicka, 2011). This literature posits a reciprocal relationship between people and place (Kaufman and Kaliner, 2011). Places are created, reproduced, and transformed by the human activities and social relations that transpire in a particular locale, as people experience and interpret the place\u2019s historically contingent meanings, values, routines, and resources (Tuan, 1977; Agnew, 1987). Cognitions and emotions shape how people interact with each other and with the material aspects of place (Scannell and Gifford, 2010). This literature conceptualizes a person who visits a public place to access its material and symbolic resources as \u201cmaking a claim\u201d on the place (Carr et al., 1992). The staff of the public place must respond by \u201cstrik[ing] the right balance among various claims on its use and meaning\u201d (Carr et al., 1992: 20) and ensuring \u201cplace claims are . . . being noticed and taken seriously\u201d (Parkinson, 2012: 1). However, the everyday cycle of claim-making and responding is not well understood (Patterson and Williams, 2005; Molotch, 2011). Researchers know little about the behavioral routines that maintain the rhythm of life of a place and how they shape people\u2019s experiences of material resources and their enduring sense of place (Stedman, 2003).",

            "text": "Other clues about how places of social inclusion might be maintained can be found in the literature on institutional work. Lawrence and Suddaby (2006: 230) defined the work of maintaining institutions as \u201csupporting, repairing, or recreating the social mechanisms that ensure compliance.\u201d Implicit in most studies is an assumption that place is just the site where actors perform institutional work directed at other institutions. Researchers have highlighted how the Cambridge University dining hall (Dacin, Munir, and Tracey, 2010) and English County Cricket grounds (Wright and Zammuto, 2013) offer settings where actors perform institutional work that (re)produces institutions of social class. Nazi concentration camps have been viewed as settings where institutional work creating social oppression was undertaken (Marti and Fernandez, 2013). Institutional work maintaining professional occupations goes on in museums, law courts, restaurants, and hospitals through the everyday actions of curators (Blagoev, Felten, and Kahn, 2018), lawyers and advocates (McPherson and Sauder, 2013; Siebert, Wilson, and Hamilton, 2017), chefs (Gill and Burrow, 2018), and physicians and nurses (Reay, Golden-Biddle, and GermAnn, 2006; Kellogg, 2009; Wright, Zammuto, and Liesch, 2017). Place was not the focus in the aforementioned studies, but Lawrence and Dover (2015) have drawn attention to how place influences institutional work, showing how places serve as \u201csocial enclosures\u201d that contain, \u201csignifiers\u201d that mediate, and \u201cpractical objects\u201d that complicate institutional work. We draw inferences from the established literature to suggest three tentative insights into how the institutional work associated with maintaining a place of social inclusion might play out.",

Selznick (1957: 94) argued that societal values are protected by institutional \u201cguardians\u201d: professionals working inside formal organizations who are entrusted with institutional values and given autonomy to defend them from subversion by other goals. While some scholars have applied Selznick\u2019s concept of guardians (Kraatz, Ventresca, and Deng, 2010; Kraatz and Flores, 2015), others have invoked Soares\u2019 (1997) term \u201ccustodian\u201d to designate the caretakers of values, traditions, and institutionalized practices (Dacin, Dacin, and Kent, 2019). For Soares (1997: 14\u201315), custodians are \u201cpractitioners who have a sense of community . . . [and] a sense of custodianship for the tradition\u2019s present and future prospects.\u201d Howard-Grenville and colleagues (2013: 119) used the term \u201ccustodians\u201d to label community members who \u201cactively and tenaciously conserved and protected the [place] identity\u201d of TrackTown USA.

Other studies have shown that moral emotions\u2014which the psychology literature links to the interests and welfare of society (Haidt, 2003)\u2014motivate reflective action to maintain, protect, and defend institutional values and practices (Fan and Zietsma, 2017; Toubiana and Zietsma, 2017; Wright, Zammuto, and Liesch, 2017).

Actions associated with maintenance may not always be obvious because the custodians who inhabit institutions are engaged in the usual day-to-day affairs of their workplace (Hallett and Ventresca, 2006; Fine and Hallett, 2014). Maintenance work may be \u201cnearly invisible and often mundane\u201d (Lawrence, Suddaby, and Leca, 2009: 1) when custodians support an institution by complying with regulations, enacting normative routines, and performing rituals (Lawrence and Suddaby, 2006; Dacin, Munir, and Tracey, 2010). Although these actions are institutionally conditioned, custodians are still able to engage in low-level intentional action by making small-scale incremental choices between sets of institutionalized practices and routines (Battilana and D\u2032Aunno, 2009). However, because breakdowns in institutionalized practices are inevitable, \u201cactive and intentional custodial work may be [necessary] for the continued stability of most institutions\u201d (Lok and de Rond, 2013: 187). More intentional maintenance work involves self-conscious action and reflection by custodians (Battilana and D\u2032Aunno, 2009), as well as deliberate efforts to resist change and to defend and repair an institution whose survival is threatened (Kellogg, 2009; Currie et al., 2012).",

Identifying and conceptualizing these places is critical because further study holds potential to advance theory about the connections between place and institutions. This is also important because the societal-level value of social inclusion is challenging to accomplish in publicly accessible and geographically bounded sites at the local level. Prior studies have suggested that places of social inclusion may be maintained by custodians, and we need to know more about how such precarious institutions can survive. Seeking to develop a deeper understanding of how the institutional work of custodians can maintain a place of social inclusion, we conducted a longitudinal qualitative study of the emergency department of a public hospital in Australia.",

These observational data were supplemented with 47 interviews with senior emergency physicians who oversaw the everyday work of the ED: 15 senior emergency physicians were interviewed twice, and 17 were interviewed on a single occasion. Interviews were semi-structured, with questions designed to elicit accounts of the emergency physician\u2019s work as a custodian of the ED as a place of social inclusion. Interviews lasted between 60 and 90 minutes and were digitally recorded and transcribed. We also interviewed nine residents who were undergoing specialty training in emergency medicine and 29 nurses about their experiences in the ED, with these interviews typically lasting 30 minutes. Four additional interviews, lasting between 60 and 90 minutes, were conducted with hospital executives, and we attended a number of staff meetings, training sessions, and strategic planning days.

In August 2014, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared a \u201cpublic health emergency of international concern.\u201d WHO estimated a possible 20,000 cases from the Ebola outbreak and a mortality rate of 70 percent. Around 10 percent of the cases and fatalities were health care aid workers. The first cases of Ebola transmission outside of Africa occurred in October 2014, when nurses in Spain and the U.S. tested positive for Ebola after treating travelers who had contracted the virus in Africa. During the epidemic, the Australian government designated our fieldsite hospital as one of Australia\u2019s \u201cEbola response and treatment hospitals.\u201d Although the ED never treated a confirmed case of Ebola, staff undertook preparations as the state\u2019s frontline responders and dealt with several persons suspected of being infected with Ebola. We included probing questions about Ebola in our interviews, engaged in informal conversations and debriefs during observations, and collected archival documents, including WHO updates, government reports, and media releases.",

Dr S, who stays to resolve some issues for an extra two hours after the end of shift, describes how P\u2019s family \u201cwent home just sobbing because someone had made an effort to try and sort it out.\u201d Emphasizing \u201cthe emergency department was a great site for it to happen,\u201d Dr S adds, \u201cBut it took a huge amount of work.

Articulating this disruption, a doctor said, \u201cThere\u2019s that real challenge to the way we\u2019ve always seen ourselves in ED as \u2018We\u2019ll see anyone, we\u2019ll help you, we\u2019ll heal you\u2019\u201d (D11).",

Individuals contemplating the violation of their custodian responsibilities by not responding universally to Ebola claims wrestled with both fear and self-conscious moral emotions like shame:I don\u2019t even know if I\u2019d be walking in there [to treat a person who might have Ebola], but by the same token that\u2019s not the way we\u2019re built in the public ED.

First, the ED as a place of social inclusion was constituted by the salient attributes of persons making claims.

Our model shows how the institution of a place of social inclusion can be maintained through microprocesses of custodianship at the local level. Every time a citizen exercises their right to universal access and presents at a local place of social inclusion to make a claim for services, custodians have a responsibility to respond. Custodians are also deeply committed to the institution\u2019s values of social inclusion. When a custodian perceives tensions between the institutional value of social inclusion and the local place\u2019s ability to actualize the value, these tensions elicit emotions and motivate multiple forms of custodian work that maintain the local place of social inclusion.",

In contrast, when custodians evaluate a claim as carrying an unknown risk, the inclusion\u2013safety tension arouses fear that is difficult for custodians to control and motivates a desire to keep the local place safe through harm-avoiding work. Because failing to respond to a claim deviates from a custodian\u2019s responsibilities and value commitments to upholding universal access, moral emotions are also elicited. If moral emotions reduce fear to a manageable level, custodians find ways to mitigate harm and protect universal access at the local place, thereby maintaining the institution of a place of social inclusion at the societal level. But if custodians\u2019 fear outweighs moral emotions, they feel justified in engaging in harm-avoiding work to protect the safety of the local place.

Scholars in institutional theory and the sociology of professions have explored how doctors, nurses, teachers, lawyers, librarians, museum curators, social workers, and other professionals maintain and change the logics, practices, values, identity, and status of professions within public emergency departments (Wright, Zammuto, and Liesch, 2017), public schools (Arum, 2000; Hallett, 2010), drug courts (McPherson and Sauder, 2013), public libraries (Nelson and Irwin, 2015), public museums (Blagoev, Felten, and Kahn, 2018), and the like. An implicit assumption is that these are places of professional work inside public-sector organizations. Our findings challenge this assumption because typifications of profession and organization are inadequate for capturing how societal-level values inhere in places at the local level. Framing geographic sites narrowly as places of professional work avoids attention to the higher level of social purpose that some of these places are mandated to fulfill in democratic society (Selznick, 1992). Viewing these places as public-sector organizations prioritizes questions associated with organizational goals and management processes (Kraatz, Ventresca, and Deng, 2010), overlooking citizens\u2019 expectations and lived experience of them not as organizations but as local places to which they are entitled access. Conjoining profession with public organization disregards the tensions between social inclusion and local resources and safety that make places of social inclusion precarious.",

In contrast to customary explanations anchored in professional, administrative, and organizational failure (Rowan, 1982; Raudenbush and Eschmann, 2015), our findings suggest these contradictions are related to the constitution of places of social inclusion as nested societal and local institutions. Whether an egalitarian institution at the societal level functions as an agent of equality or inequality at the local level depends on the volume and nature of claim-makers at a local place; it also depends on the subjective judgments of claim-responders with regard to tensions between universal access and the finite resources and safety of the local place. By revealing how the institutional dynamics of \u201cclaim making\u201d and \u201cresponding to claims\u201d are tailored to local places, our model gives researchers and policymakers a new piece of the puzzle of \u201cexperienced inequality\u201d (Selznick, 1992: 383), which was obscured when places of social inclusion were viewed through other theoretical lenses.",

Institutional complexity is likely to manifest differently when professionals work in these special places (Greenwood et al., 2011). Our findings intimate, for example, that some of the public defenders in McPherson and Sauder\u2019s (2013) study of a drug court may have been more willing to stray from their home professional logic and strategically hijack other logics because they identified as custodians of a place of social justice and were engaged in custodianship to manage resource and safety tensions. Thus our model contributes place-based insights that may help to clarify and refine theories of how professionals function as institutional agents. In a different vein, our study offers a theoretical avenue for reconciling conflicting results about the \u201cparadox of expertise\u201d when new technology emerges in professional work (Lewis, 2000). Notably, librarians in public libraries ignored the Internet as predicted by the paradox of expertise (Nelson and Irwin, 2015), while curators in public museums embraced it (Blagoev, Felten, and Kahn, 2018). Museum curators linked \u201cthe emerging technology of the Internet and the principle of providing universal access to their collection\u201d (Blagoev, Felten, and Kahn, 2018: 1773), implying they responded to the Internet as custodians of a place of social inclusion whereas librarians responded as professionals. Custodian identity for librarians became activated later, when free access to online information created safety threats in local libraries by exposing children to inappropriate or offensive material (Jaeger et al., 2012).

These were clearly present in our study of a public hospital emergency department. What our findings unmask is a distinctive type of custodian work associated with a place of social inclusion that complements existing accounts offered by scholars of professions and public administration. This raises an obvious question. If public emergency departments, for example, are both places of medicine for professionals administered by public-sector organizations and places of social inclusion for society, how can researchers separate the institutional work directed at these different institutions? Our findings show that doctors and nurses working in a public ED where all citizens could receive services distinguished their professional work from that performed in private ED settings where only patients able to pay received treatment. They explained that their professional work as doctors and nurses was similar in both settings, but that in a public ED they were also engaged in custodian work to manage value tensions associated with universal access. This custodianship of the place of social inclusion was extra work overlaid on top of the normal work of patient diagnosis, care, and treatment required in a place of acute medicine. Thus, in conceptualizing places of social inclusion, we do not theorize that all work carried out is custodian work. What differentiates custodianship is its activation through perceived value tensions between the societal-level value of social inclusion and the local place.",

While prior studies have typically reduced place to a site where work directed at other institutions happens (Siebert, Wilson, and Hamilton, 2017), our study reconceptualizes places as institutions in their own right. Our model reveals that rather than being mere background context, place is constitutive of an institution itself and consequential for the custodian work required to maintain it. We thus deepen theorizing about inhabited institutions (Hallett and Ventresca, 2006) by revealing how people inhabit institutions through their interactions with, and within, local places that are invested with societal values.",

Previous research has indicated that custodians identify with an institution and are committed to upholding its values and standards (Selznick, 1957; Soares, 1997), which motivates them to invest effort in custodian work to protect the institution (Dacin, Dacin, and Kent, 2019). Our findings call into question an implicit assumption in much of the custodianship literature about how custodians think about and engage with the boundaries of an institution. Although researchers have not focused explicitly on modes of engagement, the findings of prior research suggest this can be an important aspect of custodianship. Studies have reported that custodians maintain and protect institutions by restricting to insiders the performance rituals at the Cambridge dining hall and Texas A&M University\u2019s Aggie Bonfire (Dacin and Dacin, 2008; Dacin, Munir, and Tracey, 2010), closing off the outside world\u2019s access to the Scottish Advocates Library (Siebert, Wilson, and Hamilton, 2017), and excluding experiences not authentic to the remembered past of Oregon\u2019s TrackTown (Howard-Grenville, Metzger, and Meyer, 2013). As these examples highlight, studies tend to assume a singular mode of engagement in which custodians work to contain the boundaries of institutional participation by separating those who belong within an institution\u2019s values, norms, identities, and practices from those who do not. Our model of custodianship challenges this implicit assumption of boundary containment. We reveal an alternative mode of engagement in which custodians may purposefully direct effort to keep an institution\u2019s boundaries open rather than contained.",

On the one hand, there might not be enough resources for custodians to keep the institution open for everyone seeking participation; on the other hand, closing off the institution\u2019s boundaries to some or all participants to conserve resources violates values and expectations of the custodian role. This value tension elicits moral emotions and motivates custodian work to ration and enable resources in ways that keep the institution open for everyone. In contrast, resource demands do not appear to activate value tensions of this nature when the mode of engagement for custodian work is boundary containment. Thus the processes of resource rationing and resource enabling we find in places of social inclusion are distinctive from other forms of custodian work because the mode of engagement is boundary permeability rather than containment.",

We extend prior research that shows moral emotions play a role in institutional work by illuminating when and how they can activate custodian work that protects an institution\u2019s values. Moral emotions are feelings that are prosocial and motivate action tendencies for the interests of others (Haidt, 2003; Tangney, Stuewig, and Mashek, 2007). Previous studies have focused attention on how moral emotions\u2014including empathy for others, pride in moral rightness, and shame at moral wrongs\u2014motivate institutional work to create, maintain, and change institutions (Moisander, Hirsto, and Fahy, 2016; Fan and Zietsma, 2017; Toubiana and Zietsma, 2017; Wright, Zammuto, and Liesch, 2017). Adding to this growing line of research, our study highlights how moral emotions motivate custodian work when actors care deeply about the values of an institution and perceive tension between those values and their accomplishment in local places. Moreover, our findings reveal that embedded actors can feel emotional attachment to both institutions and local places. Thus we speculate that the intensity of moral emotions may be stronger when institutional work is targeted at maintaining institutions that are constituted as places, although future research is needed to explore this possibility.",

First, an institution\u2019s regulations, norms, and systemic power arouse fear among institutional actors, which disciplines them to conform (Marti and Fernandez, 2013; Gill and Burrow, 2018). Second, institutional actors may use fear as a motivational force to collectively create, maintain, and change institutions (Moisander, Hirsto, and Fahy, 2016; Wijaya and Heugens, 2018). Both explanations are rooted in a socialized understanding of fear as being experienced in the context of institutions (Voronov and Vince, 2012). In contrast, our study of Ebola in a public emergency department reveals the potential for an alternative understanding in which fear is less directly connected to a person\u2019s socialization within an institution and operates at a more basic level. This conceptualization resonates with the psychology literature on basic emotions, in which fear is an immediate intuitive reaction to a stimulus that triggers human behavior for survival (Ekman, 1992, 1999). Custodians\u2019 initial fears about the Ebola virus were basic emotions, and the immediate instinct was self-defense to avoid personal harm. This distinction between fear as a socialized and basic emotion is not trivial. Whereas prior research has shown that socialized fear is an important and relatively straightforward mechanism in institutional maintenance (Creed et al., 2014; Gill and Burrow, 2018), our study reveals that institutional processes are more complicated when institutional actors feel fear as a basic emotion.",

In our study, moral emotions that were endogenously embedded in the institution of a place of social inclusion\u2014including empathy for the needs of institutional participants and embarrassment at the possibility of failing to uphold the institution\u2019s values\u2014rose up to play off against fear triggered exogenously as a basic emotion by the environmental jolt of the Ebola outbreak. Through their self-consciously evaluative nature, moral emotions helped to dampen fear to the degree that custodians were able to fight against their own basic instincts for self-preservation and engage in institutional work to maintain the institution. A comparable interplay of moral emotions and basic emotions appears to have normalized fears associated with custodian work in response to familiar infectious diseases and patient violence. Thus our model extends prior research on moral emotions by illuminating their critical role in moderating fear, which otherwise has the potential to derail institutional maintenance. We speculate that if a patient suffering from Ebola or behaving violently caused serious harm or death to others, basic emotions might overwhelm more reflective moral emotions and disrupt ordinary processes of institutional maintenance. We call for further research exploring the dynamics of fear and institutional disruption, which events associated with the COVID-19 pandemic suggest is an issue of vital global importance for places of social inclusion.",

Our study benefitted methodologically when an unexpected environmental jolt (Meyer, 1982) during our fieldwork cast the basic emotion of fear into sharp relief. Thus it is hardly surprising that the relationships between basic and moral emotions and institutional work revealed in our study have been largely hidden until now. We conjecture that these relationships are generalizable to other institutions beyond places of social inclusion. We suspect, for example, that institutional work to create Canada\u2019s first safe narcotics injection sites in Lawrence\u2019s (2017) study and institutional work to disrupt organized crime in Sicily in Vaccaro and Palazzo\u2019s (2015) study were both enabled by moral emotions controlling institutional actors\u2019 basic emotions of fear. In addition to exploring the experience of fear in other types of institutions, we invite investigation of other basic emotions identified in the psychology literature, including anger, disgust, happiness, sadness, and surprise (Ekman, 1992, 1999). Future research into institutional work could explore when and how instinctive basic emotions work with and against higher-order reflective emotions that are more closely connected with actors\u2019 socialization and embeddedness within institutions, such as moral anger and betrayal (Toubiana and Zietsma, 2017; Wijaya and Heugens, 2018), shame (Creed et. al., 2014), other-suffering empathy (Wright, Zammuto, and Liesch, 2017), and pride (Fan and Zietsma, 2017).",

We offer insight into how these institutions are maintained across nested societal and local levels through the purposeful work of custodians. We invite research exploring custodianship in diverse places of social inclusion, ranging from places with venerable histories of inclusion like public schools and museums to recently emerging places like sanctuary cities. Our findings about how such places endure are timely in light of the overwhelming fear and disruptions to places of social inclusion in the wake of the global coronavirus pandemic and given contested political discourse in the U.S. and Europe about what it means for nations, cities, and communities to be socially inclusive places. We encourage scholars to explore places of social inclusion and to expand the theorization and empirical investigation of place and institutions.",
