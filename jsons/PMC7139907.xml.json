Its exponentially increasing number of cases and large-scale spread of the emerging virus are being regarded as resulted from human-to-human transmission, initiated and promoted by the human mobility in global and local scales (Du Toit 2020; Liu and Saif 2020; Munster et al. 2020; Phan et al. 2020).",

There have been many investigations concerning the effect of transportation (or population dispersal) on the spread of a transmissible disease, and especially conducted been many theoretical/mathematical studies taken account of such a possibility for some individuals to become infective during transportation in order to such an significant contribution of transport-related infection [as a recent review, see Walters et al. (2018) and references therein; especially for the SARS virus transmission, see Wang (2014)]. Not only the particular transportation with a long travel, but also the human quotidian mobility as a common phase of the human activity can be considered as one of relevant factors that could cause the spread of a transmissible disease such as influenza (WHO 2018). So is the case of today\u2019s spread of COVID-2019 in each local region of every country (ECDC 2020; WHO 2020).",

At the central place, the commuters make their social activities. Falc\u00f3n-Lezama et al. (2016) considered a very similar situation and analyzed a mathematical model of SEIR type with respect to the dengue epidemic dynamics and its control. Differently from theirs, the principal subject of our analysis about our model is the dependence of the spread of a transmissible disease on the community structure represented by the commuting subpopulation size, and we will try to discuss the community structure to have the smaller risk of the disease spread, that is, to have its higher resistance to the disease spread over the community. However, we shall not intend to make any discussion about the control to realize the smaller risk of the disease spread. This is because we will consider only daily activity characterizing the community structure and its contribution to the risk, so that we regard it as very hard to control any factors in such activity closely related to the daily life. Since the nature of such daily activity is gradually changing as the lifestyle becomes modified, we will try to give some arguments about the prospective change in the risk of the spread of a transmissible disease in future, and about the difference in the risk between communities different from each other in their structures.",

In constrast, if the main commuting method between the residential districts and the central place is a public transportation in which the commuters from different residential districts are mixed, the commuter can be considered to be at the social phase of our modeling (Fig. 2b, c). In reality, some commuters could be considered to be at the private phase, while the other as being at the social phase. In further detail, commuting of each commuter could be considered to be at the private phase in the earlier period and at the social phase in the rest period.

In this paper, we considered two types of the formula for the infection force: the mass-action and the ratio-dependent (frequency-dependent). These are frequently used for the population dynamics modeling about the disease spread in a variety of contexts, especially with the system of differential equations. As discussed in Diekmann et al. (2013), the formula for the infection force should be introduced appropriately for the reasonable modeling about the contact pattern characterized by the transmissible disease considered in each research project. Our analysis of the model in this paper was not for a specific transmissible disease, whereas it gave some theoretical results clearly showing the significant difference depending on the formula for the infection force. This means that the nature of the spread of a transmissible disease in a community significantly depends on the contact pattern characterizing a relation between the community and the disease.",

However, as we did for our model in this paper, some different formulas for the infection force could be appropriate to be introduced in the model as the reasonable modeling, because the contact pattern itself could be regarded as heterogeneous in the community (Britton and Giardina 2016; Yin et al. 2017; Cui et al. 2018; Goeyvaerts et al. 2018). For this reason, the results about our model with different combinations of the formulas for the infection force demonstrated that such a heterogeneity in the contact pattern could cause a significant difference in the conclusion of an epidemic dynamics, depending on communities different with respect to the characteristics about the contact pattern, for example, as discussed in Keeling et al. (2010) and Balcan and Vespignani (2011) by the network-based numerical models.",

A definite example of such factors in the modern era is the teleworking or the telecommuting. Teleworking could be defined in general as a form of labor that consists of at least partial working at non-conventional workspace with a certain practical use of the information and telecommunication equipment (Sato 2013), whereas its meaning would appear still vague (Garad and Ismail 2018). It has been investigated as one of the trends and the policies about the modern working style, following the developments in information and communication technologies (ICT) (Eurofound and the International Labour Office 2017; Messenger 2018; Morikawa 2018). Although the effect of teleworking on the working pattern is open to debate (de Abreu e Silva and Melo 2018a, b), we could expect that it would contribute to the increase of the duration at the private phase defined in this paper. Therefore, such a prospective shift in the working pattern would cause the change in the risk of the spread of a transmissible disease for the community.",
