However, since Goffman\u2019s now-classic work on the subject, there have been many linguistic shifts, conceptual slippages, and new contributions to the theorization and understanding of stigma. More recent interpretations of stigma emphasize the psychological and social aspects of stigma, as well as highlight the critical role of power and systemic inequalities which can work to produce or reinforce existing stigmas (Castro and Farmer 2005; Parker and Aggleton 2003). Link and Phelan (2001) stipulate that, in order for stigma to develop, there must be an element of power involved; they do not specifically state who it is that is exercising the power they mention, but surely the differential exists in favor of those doing the stigmatizing. Similarly, Castro and Farmer (2005) argue that for a more nuanced understanding of stigma and its effects in an infectious disease and treatment context, the power structures and inequities that produce poor access to care and treatment should be an integral component of the analysis of stigma production. Parker and Aggleton (2003:13) also argue that stigma \u201cfeeds upon, strengthens and reproduces existing inequalities of class, race, gender, and sexuality.\u201d",

Parker and Aggleton (2003) suggest that many times, stemming from Goffman (though, they say, perhaps mistakenly so), authors treat stigma as an individual process and as a static, fixed item that exists. However, they argue that stigma also \u201cplays a key role in producing and reproducing power relations and control\u2026To properly understand issues of stigmatization and discrimination\u2026requires us to think more broadly about how some individuals and groups come to be socially excluded, and about the forces that create and reinforce exclusion in different settings,\u201d advocating for analysis of stigma that takes into account its fluid and generative capabilities (Parker and Aggleton 2003:16). Parker and Aggleton (2003) further argue that conceptualizing stigma as an individual process may work in cultures that are more individualistic but, in more communal cultures, stigma clearly works at the level of entire groups of people, affecting them through the connections of kin, community, or village. Barrett and Brown (2008:S34) explain that since Goffman\u2019s time, stigma has come to mean a process of negative discrimination \u201cagainst people with certain physical, behavioral, or social attributes,\u201d going on to say that stigma is \u201can illness in itself, comorbid with respect to its marked physical conditions\u201d (Barrett and Brown 2008:S34).",

            "text": "There are several similarities between Ebola virus disease (EVD) and other stigma-inducing conditions, most particularly HIV/AIDS (see also Davtyan et al. 2014). Maman et al. (2009) found in their multinational study of HIV stigma and attendant discrimination that the factors contributing to HIV stigma and discrimination were: \u201cfear of transmission, fear of suffering and death, and the burden of caring\u201d for someone living with HIV/AIDS (Maman et al. 2009). Unlike in the case of HIV/AIDS, in which a patient might now expect, with access to proper health care and antiretroviral drugs, to live many years with few outward signs and symptoms of the disease, Ebola virus disease strikes relatively quickly, with an incubation period of between 2 and 21 days (WHO 2017), and can rapidly ravage the bodies of victims. In the most severe cases, the sufferer\u2019s body hemorrhages in a gruesome display. Though the timeline of EVD is accelerated in comparison to that of HIV, Maman et al.\u2019s (2009) criteria for stigma and discrimination are most certainly all present. In other settings, the fear of infection appears to be a primary driver of stigma, as with tuberculosis stigma in Ghana (Dodor et al. 2008). On a group level, stigma might be collectively produced or reproduced through fear of a condition or state of being, thereby acting as a protective mechanism when individuals or a society feel they are at risk due to the condition (c.f. Dodor et al. 2008).",

            "text": "Recently, scholars have been interested in stigma facing people with HIV/AIDS , but stigma has long been attached to other behaviors and medical conditions. For example, many scholars have written of stigma in the context of people living with tuberculosis and leprosy (for a small sampling see: Adhikari et al. 2014; Amo-Adjei 2016; Barrett 2005; Chinouya and Adeyangu 2017; Coreil et al. 2010; Courtwright and Turner 2010; Garbin et al. 2015). In the case of leprosy , the infected person, without proper access to early and effective treatment, can often exhibit physical deformities, including the loss of digits or open ulcers. Adhikari et al. (2014) found these outwardly visible manifestations of the disease to be correlated with higher degrees of stigmatization for leprosy patients. In such instances, it is difficult for the sufferer to conceal their condition, opening them to increased stigma. Both Luka in the Sudan (2010) and Heijnders in Nepal (2004) found that the stigmatization of people with leprosy occurred in two stages. The first stage, the cognitive dimension, describes the degree of influence that leprosy has on the person\u2019s life. The patients \u201cpass through the concealability course, disruptive, aesthetic, origin and peril dimensions\u201d (Bainson and van den Borne 1998). In the second stage, or the affective stage, the person with leprosy undergoes social devaluation. Heijnders also found that stigma reinforced those preexisting inequalities that already existed in the community with regard to social class, gender, and age (Heijnders 2004).",

A member of the Filovirus (Filoviridae) family of viruses, the Ebola virus was first identified in 1976, at which time it was initially believed to represent a new strain of another filoviral agent, the Marburg virus. Western investigators\u2019 attention was first drawn to a human outbreak of the virus that occurred in late August, 1976, when people with a hemorrhagic fever syndrome began to arrive at the rural Yambuku Mission Hospital in northwestern Zaire (now the Democratic Republic of Congo).1 Stigma, the subject of this chapter, constituted one of the major deciding factors that determined the name for the new virus in 1976. Previous viral agents had been named after the villages where they first occurred.2 In the case of the Ebola virus, to avoid permanently stigmatizing the village from which it was first recognized, it was decided instead to assign it a different name than that of the village of Yambuku where the index epidemic had occurred (Gholipour 2014).3",

This act of quarantining people created ruptures in the preexisting social structures and reinforced the social distance of EVD patients from their social networks through physical removal to other, specially designated spaces. Their removal to sites often constructed by outsiders (humanitarian organizations, for example) could have served to reinforce the patient\u2019s strangeness, abnormality, and their threat to other, uninfected individuals. From there, it was only a matter of time until the mere suspicion of Ebola virus infection could start the work of this separation, contributing to stigma production. Dodor et al. (2008) also suggest, in Ghana, that the ways in which health care workers treated TB patients, separating them from family members and restricting their access to visitors, donning extra personal protective equipment (PPE) when attending the patients, and barring families from returning corpses of deceased TB patients to their homes, all contributed to community perceptions of TB as a shameful disease, increasing community fear of the condition. Many of these same aspects of infection prevention and control were present in Ebola-affected areas during the 2013\u20132015 outbreak but on a much larger scale, and were, out of necessity, undertaken with greater rapidity. These behaviors or activities borne of infection prevention protocols would fall into what Brown et al. (2015:3) term \u201creorganizations of spatial and material worlds\u201d which \u201care among the most striking interventions to manage Ebola\u201d and could have multivalent meanings for social relations within communities that would, ultimately, disrupt containment efforts. The ways in which local and international organizations enacted many of these containment protocols both engendered and exacerbated community resentment, mistrust, and, at times, hostility that transformed into outright violence directed at the people working to implement public health measures (Calain and Poncin 2015).",

This could, in turn, suggest that countries in which citizens have low confidence in state structures might experience greater levels of EVD-related stigma; as a population at risk, with little other recourse (in the absence of confidence in the state to be able to protect them), began ostracizing the members of society they considered to be the greatest threat to them. Pregnant women , having unpredictable bodily fluids and, upon delivery, Ebola-infected amniotic fluid, hemorrhage, and placental tissue, would certainly fall into that category. The health care workers involved in the care of EVD patients also fell into this category, as well as those people thought to be even remotely affiliated with health facilities or locations in which EVD patients had been.",

            "text": "In their discussion of HIV/AIDS stigma, Castro and Farmer (2005) argue that a driving force behind the stigma is a lack of access to treatment. Stigma is not the determining factor in treatment seeking but, instead, economic and logistical barriers decide who will be able to avail themselves of care (Castro and Farmer 2005). In the case of EVD, poor infrastructure and weak public health systems were undeniable contributors to the spread of the disease. Additionally, as Castro and Farmer (2005) indicate, EVD differentially affected people based upon economic resources. In one of the stories we analyze later in this chapter, the family was able to pay an exorbitant sum for the pregnant wife to access care, but many others did not have the economic means to pursue even regular obstetric care at any cost. These infrastructure and economic constraints, when combined with a high case fatality rate and rapid progression of clinical EVD, dramatically set Ebola apart from HIV/AIDS. Taken together with the criteria of Maman et al. (2009) for stigma, particularly as related to the fears of suffering and death and the fear of transmission, the weak state in many of the affected countries provided the perfect storm for the development of strong and pervasive Ebola stigma. We argue here that it is likely that health care workers and community members fell back on stigmatization as, what they saw as, one of only a few possible ways of protecting themselves. Pregnant women, even those unaffected by the virus, suffered the consequences of people\u2019s fears, which took the form of increased stigma that caused many women to be refused care at health facilities. The health care system was undeniably overwhelmed by the number of Ebola patients and the particular needs for quarantine and supplies these patients presented. The fact that an Ebola epidemic was able to effectively shut down any and all routine health care services, particularly vital functions related to obstetric care, is a testament to the long-standing weaknesses of these systems (Chothia 2014).",

            "text": "While others have begun to write about the lasting stigmatization that Ebola survivors (Karafillakis et al. 2016; van Bortel et al. 2016) or Ebola orphans (Denis-Ramirez et al. 2017) have been experiencing since the end of the outbreak, we are most interested here in examining stigma that occurred during the active phase of the outbreak. Likewise, we have chosen to limit our discussion to the experiences of women who were pregnant at the time of Ebola. In this chapter, we argue for a reexamination of stigma in the context of transient, acute crises. Without first understanding more about the ways in which people use or suffer from the effects of stigmatization under these circumstances, it will be impossible to mitigate the effects of stigma in similar situations. We use a meaning-centered approach to stigma, thinking through what is at stake for both the stigmatized and stigmatizing groups. Next, we put forth examples of three ways in which pregnant women were particularly affected by stigma in the health care setting during the 2014\u20132015 Ebola virus outbreak in West Africa: (1) Women/community stigmatization and avoidance of health care facilities; (2) Stigmatization of health care workers due to association with Ebola; and (3) Stigmatization directed toward pregnant women (or perceived stigma), which prevented women from receiving care when pregnant or during delivery and in the postpartum period. We then explore the consequences of this stigmatization, seeking to answer questions such as: how did women and/or their family members seek to combat stigmatization? How did pregnant women\u2019s stigmatization of other parties (namely health care workers) affect their access to obstetric care? What were the intended effects of stigmatizing health workers? What were the protective effects of stigmatizing pregnant women and for whom? How did reluctance to care for pregnant women result in compounding adverse effects for a segment of the population that was already at far greater risk for death\u2014both from pregnancy-related causes, and Ebola virus itself? The residual effects of EVD, even in people who have survived and recovered, are bound to increase the chances that any similar future outbreak of EVD could generate even more severe stigma because people will have the collective memory of the previous outbreak and its devastating effects.",

            "text": "Women who are pregnant are at an especially high risk for becoming infected with EVD, and then having poor clinical outcomes, for several reasons. Depending on the community norms of their particular ethnic group, women, and pregnant women perhaps even more so, typically have less mobility than do other members of the society, are often dependent upon men or more senior women for decisions related to seeking health care, are poorer than men, and have less access and control over economic resources (Coulter 2009). There are frequently concomitant biological factors which may make pregnant women even more susceptible such as anemia, altered immunity due to pregnancy or reduced health over their life course, low body mass index (BMI), malnutrition and poor nutritional quality of the diet, and other complications of pregnancy including diabetes and hypertensive diseases. Pregnant women may spend more time in health care settings, such as clinics and hospitals, due to the pregnancy itself or due to monthly visits with their young children, or as they accompany others seeking care, and thus have greater exposure to nosocomial transmission of all diseases, not simply Ebola. Pregnant women may also have fewer treatment options or choice of medications because of potential teratogenic effects on the fetus and, if postpartum, due to breastfeeding. As was seen in previous Ebola outbreaks in Uganda and Democratic Republic of the Congo, women are often placed at greater risk for infection due to gender specific roles and activities, particularly those related to funerary practices, which have been well-studied in these previous outbreaks and have taken on a prominent role in gender-specific risk (Anoko 2014; Barbato 2014; Hewlett and Amola 2003; Segers 2014; World Health Organization 2007).",

In previous outbreaks of the Ebola virus, there have been no documented neonatal survivors from pregnant women infected with the virus (CDC 2016a). The most recent data from the West African epidemic indicate that there are very few infants born to Ebola-infected mothers who survived as neonates for even a few days (Howard 2005; Jamieson et al. 2014).7 Those newborns who have survived following their mother\u2019s Ebola virus infection have been highly profiled in the media (Awford 2015; Chicago Tribune 2015; Martel 2014; M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res 2015).8 Women and children are also vulnerable to the continued effects of destabilization within their countries after the official termination of the outbreak. We are now seeing the beginning signs of lasting physiological and psychological effects of Ebola even on those who made a full recovery after initial infection (Clark et al. 2015; Maron 2015). In these instances, it is clear that Ebola survivors will continue to face the continuing impact of their infection for years to come in the form of the physiological effects mentioned above, but also in the form of social effects. Early findings suggest survivors and children left orphaned due to the outbreak may suffer from on-going stigmatization (Denis-Ramirez et al. 2017). It is also expected that comorbid diseases, especially those that are vaccine-preventable such as measles and meningitis, may now have a resurgence as a result of interruptions of routine immunization practices caused by the Ebola epidemic, which further weakened already strained health systems (Takahashi et al. 2015).",

Early during the development of this outbreak, a preponderance of women were affected, with infected women outnumbering infected men by a 3 to 1 ratio in Liberia, and 2 to 1 in both Guinea and Sierra Leone (Barbato 2014; Bofu-Tawamba 2014; Hogan 2014; Life for African Mothers 2014). This was the result of customs which have been well-described\u2014women had the major roles in providing care for the ill and preparing the dead for burial (Men\u00e9ndez et al. 2015). It was not until much later in the epidemic that the ratio of new cases normalized to equal numbers of both sexes being infected by early 2015 (Saul 2015; Thomas 2014; WHO 2015). While it has not been systematically confirmed, this equalization perhaps represented effective education concerning modes of transmission, risk behaviors, and an increase in resources coming from governments, volunteers, and nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and their assistance in the removal and burial of the dead.",

This had dire consequences even for women who were not infected with the virus\u2014during the height of the epidemic from October 2014 to October 2015, it was estimated that 800,000 women would give birth in Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea, and that up to 120,000 mothers could die if denied access to emergency obstetrical care; this is equivalent to almost 330 women dying from pregnancy each day (Boseley 2014; Hayden 2014; UNFPA 2014c, d). At that time, the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) had estimated that, unless sufficient emergency obstetrical care was provided, the maternal death rates in these three countries could effectively double to levels seen in the 1990s during times of political unrest, civil war, and violence. This increase would represent a maternal mortality ratio (MMR)9 of 1000 in Guinea and Liberia, and over 2000 in Sierra Leone (UNFPA 2015).",

Among pregnant women and their infants, however, there is evidence to suggest that the mortality rates are higher. In an analysis of 12 published studies of 108 pregnant women and 110 fetal outcomes following Ebola virus infection in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, there were 91 maternal deaths, a case fatality rate of 84.3%, and only one surviving fetus (Garba et al. 2017). In a study of 111 reported cases of EVD among pregnant women in all three West African countries, Bebell et al. (2017) found an aggregate maternal death rate of 86% (Bebell et al. 2017).",

After the end of the outbreak, many health care workers continued to experience the social repercussions of carrying out their professional duties\u2014they have been ostracized and stigmatized in their communities (McMahon et al. 2016). The health care workers themselves lamented the drastic changes in patient-provider interactions that the Ebola outbreak necessitated; gone were many of the small gestures that communicate closeness and caring in these contexts, such as sitting in close proximity, touching a patient\u2019s arm or hand, or helping a breastfeeding mother with her baby\u2019s latch (McMahon et al. 2016). Quarantines imposed on health facilities that experience compromised contact with people with EVD \u201cinduced panic within facilities and the broader community\u201d (McMahon et al. 2016:1235) and health care providers in such communities reported that many people delayed seeking treatment because they associated facilities with points of Ebola transmission (McMahon et al. 2016). McMahon et al. (2016:1235) additionally state that one provider told them, \u201c\u2018If we have not done triage, we are not going to take care of that person even if she is in labor\u2026we have to abandon her on the street.\u2019\u201d McMahon et al.\u2019s (2016) findings clearly demonstrate the ways in which all three forms of stigma were at play in these communities\u2014people came to associate facilities with transmission points for Ebola; health care workers were stigmatized due to their work caring for patients and for changed behavior necessitated by the outbreak; and even when pregnant women did elect to seek health care services, they might not be treated but left on the street to give birth alone, no one willing to risk assisting her.",

This behavior presents one way in which Ebola stigma affected maternal health\u2014by not seeking care for fear of infection or contact with possible Ebola patients, pregnant mothers put themselves at risk for complications left undetected or untreated. There was also fear of physicians, nurses, and other health workers among some people, fueled by rumors and conspiracy theories including that health personnel and aid organizations were responsible for spreading the virus. In one occurrence in Guinea, these fears resulted in the deaths of eight health workers who were killed by members of the community during a health education campaign (BBC 2014). The murder of these health care workers was, arguably, an extreme example of enacted stigma as community members killed those thought responsible for the disease and its effects. The deaths of health care workers in countries that already suffered from a severe health worker deficit further limited the number of those who would have been able to serve pregnant women, when pregnant women overcame their fears of health facilities and providers.",

I tell them, \u2018So who\u2019s killing the nurses?\u2019\u201d (Moore 2014). At the same maternity ward, a pregnant women developed a fever, but the woman resisted attempts by the staff to medicate her. She yelled to the staff, \u201cMy husband told me I shouldn\u2019t take any injections here!\u201d When the staff spoke with her husband, he refused to permit them to treat his pregnant wife and brought her home. Jemimah Kargbo was on duty at the maternity ward when the woman left. \u201cShe will die. With a fever like that, she will definitely die. Maybe the baby too,\u201d she said (Moore 2014). These quotes raise a number of other issues related to the differential effect of the Ebola virus outbreak on pregnant women, as well as the effects of stigma associated with EVD itself, and the stigma those people in close contact with Ebola victims attracted in the course of caring for them\u2014be they biomedical health workers, Red Cross volunteers, or family members caring for relatives in their homes. The stigma associated with working in proximity to Ebola patients, or associated with the perception that one was working with Ebola patients, effectively led some pregnant women, such as Comfort Tapeh above, to reject assistance from health care workers. Comfort\u2019s case demonstrates, too, the ways in which stigma contributed to Comfort\u2019s desire to risk possible death due to infection instead of, what she perceived to be, the worse fate of risking infection from the Ebola virus while in the hospital.",

            "text": "Data from the CDC in Atlanta have confirmed that fewer pregnant women were seeking care in clinics and hospitals\u2014Dynes et al. (2015) and Luginaah et al. (2016) state the evidence suggests the outbreak most likely eroded recent gains in utilization of prenatal and delivery care in Libera. In the Kenema District of Sierra Leone, a high prevalence area for Ebola virus infections, during the period May to July 2014, there were 29% fewer antenatal care visits and 21% fewer postnatal care visits than occurred prior to the outbreak. The CDC researchers conducted a focus group among pregnant and lactating women and they found that these declines in care-seeking behavior were motivated by fear of becoming infected with Ebola at the facilities and mistrust of the physicians (Dynes et al. 2015). Here, we see both the first and second forms of stigma we proposed above\u2014women and their relatives were stigmatizing health care workers and the facilities in which they worked. This stigmatization or discrimination was motivated by fear and a lack of trust. Returning to Parker and Aggleton\u2019s (2003) assertions that stigma reveals power relations and social processes, we can read women\u2019s stigmatization of health care facilities and workers as a different form of power relations. The stigmatization of these health care providers during the Ebola outbreak had roots in a much longer history of distrust of state institutions and health care workers who were unable to provide consistently high quality care due to a persistently weak health care system in many of these countries (Blair et al. 2017). While the pregnant women themselves may not have had any real form of power over health care workers, we suggest that their stigmatization of health providers and facilities, leading to avoidance of services, was a result of systemic and on-going disempowerment of women and community members in the biomedical system, produced by weak state institutions. It is also possible that pregnant women were acting out of perceived, or internalized, stigma (Luginaah et al. 2016), a fear of being stigmatized when they reported to health facilities, as we discuss further below. According to the chief executive of ActionAid, Justin Forsyth, \u201cEbola is having a huge impact on wider health issues like maternal healthcare. No children have gone to school since March and pregnant mums are avoiding health clinics and hospitals. One clinic I went to said the admissions had plummeted from 80 a day to 20\u2013a worrying stat when the UN estimates that 800,000 mums will give birth in the coming year across the region\u201d (Boseley 2014).",

            "text": "The clinics and hospitals were so overwhelmed with caring for victims of the Ebola outbreak that providing obstetrical services for noninfected women became less of a priority. An important result of this was decreased prenatal care for pregnant women, placing them and their unborn children at higher risk for undetected complications such as other infectious diseases including malaria, HIV and tuberculosis, hypertensive diseases of pregnancy, anemia, and obstructed labor. \u201cThe lack of access by women, especially pregnant women, to reproductive health services is a major health disaster in waiting,\u201d said John K. Mulbah, Chairman of the Obstetrics and Gynaecology Department at the University of Liberia (UNFPA 2014a). \u201cAs a result of the outbreak, there has been an increase in pregnant women dying from preventable causes, including antepartum and post-partum hemorrhage, ruptured uterus, as well as hypertensive disease,\u201d said Dr. Mulbah. Pregnant women had to give birth without medical supervision, often without a midwife, and occasionally even alone. In Monrovia, 36 year-old Comfort Fayiah went into labor and was taken by her husband to four different clinics and hospitals to deliver her twins, but she was refused admittance to all four. Her husband, Victor Fayiah, said, \u201cI begged them, I cried, but they bluntly refused.\u201d On the final day of hospitalization, an up-front payment of $450 for a surgical delivery was demanded. \u201cThe hospital administration requested a cash down payment of $450 before my wife would be touched,\u201d said her husband. \u201cUpon realizing that we did not have the money, and for fear that my wife could pass away in their premises, a man acting on the order of the hospital physically pushed my wife out. He said, \u2018Get outside! Do you think this is a free hospital?\u2019\u201d After leaving in the rain, they hadn\u2019t walked more than 10 m before Mrs. Fayiah fell onto the street and began to deliver her twins. She received no care from the hospital staff, but instead was assisted by people passing by and onlookers. A nurse assistant on a motorbike stopped to help deliver the twins (UNFPA 2014d). Hayden (2014) relates another situation in which a laboring woman was left to give birth alone in the back of an ambulance in Liberia. When the mother arrived at an MSF Ebola management center, the obstetrician found that the woman\u2019s placenta and now-dead baby were still between her legs; tests later determined neither the mother nor baby had had Ebola (Hayden 2014). Despite the fact that the woman was not infected with the Ebola virus, health care workers had been too afraid of contamination from the copious bodily fluids involved in birth to chance assisting her without full-body protective equipment.",

Giving birth at home is dangerous\u2014there is a risk of hepatitis or HIV infections being transmitted because instruments are not sterilized, as well as life-threatening hemorrhage from a placental abruption, uterine rupture, placenta previa, velamentous cord, retained placenta, or coagulopathy (Schwartz 2015). Giving birth at home also generally takes place with the assistance of untrained relatives or perhaps local midwives who may or may not have had any experience or training related to pregnancy or delivery complications, and may not be able to recognize and deal with an emergency should one arise. This further endangers the lives of both the mother and her baby; a woman can live with hepatitis or HIV, but without proper emergency treatment, will most likely not recover from hemorrhage leading to hypovolemic shock. Should an obstructed delivery occur, which is one of the most frequent causes of maternal death in sub-Saharan Africa, there is no provision for performance of a life-saving Cesarean section at home (Schwartz 2015).",

            "text": " Social stigmatization can result from the fear of disease, as well as the fear of people who are understood to be different, often due to perceived connections with the contagion. During an infectious disease outbreak, these two fears can occur simultaneously, resulting in the stigmatization of strangers with or without the disease. This stigmatization creates numerous problems for both care givers and care seekers, increasing the suffering of infected people and interfering with public health measures to control the outbreak, as well as the provision of health care (Des Jarlais et al. 2006; Goffman 1963). From a contemporary historical perspective, stigmatization has been an important sociological aspect of many infectious diseases including Hansen\u2019s disease (leprosy), AIDS, tuberculosis, and SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) to name but a few (Obilade 2015). During the 2013\u20132015 Ebola epidemic, besides the problem of pregnant women intentionally avoiding health care facilities, many others were stigmatized when seeking treatment at a clinic or hospital due to the widespread general fear regarding the Ebola outbreak. As a result, when pregnant women sought health care, in some cases they were turned away for fear that they were infected with Ebola virus. For example, in August 2014, Sierra Leonean filmmaker Arthur Pratt was working in Freetown to educate people about the Ebola outbreak. Because all hospitals there were closed to non-Ebola-infected cases, he was forced to drive his 8-month pregnant wife to her mother\u2019s village, many hours distant, in order to give birth. \u201cA lot of women are having to give birth in the house now,\u201d he said during an interview, \u201cAll of the hospitals are closed. They have nowhere to go\u201d (Sepkowitz and Haglage 2014). In the case of Aminata, a young pregnant woman who presented to a health care facility in Sierra Leone with a life-threatening obstructed labor, medical staff at the health care facility were afraid to treat her because she might have Ebola virus disease. While waiting for the results of her blood test for the infection, she was transferred to an Ebola holding center so that she could be rushed for a cesarean section if her test was negative. Aminata and her unborn fetus died from complications of the obstructed labor while waiting for the test results\u2014they were found to be negative for Ebola virus hours later (Farmer and Koroma 2015).",

The maternity ward nursing staff repeatedly discussed a deficiency of personal protective equipment (PPE) available at the hospital under normal circumstances and wanted to know why the maternity ward staff had not been the first to be trained in proper techniques for isolating Ebola patients and recognizing the virus\u2019s early symptoms. The nurses were of the opinion that the maternity ward staff, with their intimate and nearly continual contact with vast quantities of bodily fluids, would be the first to be infected and die from Ebola in the event that the virus became an issue in their region. Under normal conditions, these midwives expressed a concern with their greater than average exposure to bodily fluids and a lack of vaccines for diseases such as Hepatitis B (Strong 2018). This fear and concern most certainly was multiplied exponentially for midwives working in the areas most heavily affected by the EVD epidemic. Surely, any amount of money to deal with bodily fluids that may or may not be infected was poor incentive for providers to expose themselves to infection and a terrifying death as they watched or heard of their colleagues dying around them.",

            "text": "Compounding the stigmatization of pregnant women due to their potential Ebola infection was a much older, geographically widespread stigma that ties women\u2019s bodily fluids to concepts of pollution, dirt, and contamination. In some places, only women from groups which are already constructed as polluted or polluting are considered suitable birth attendants in order to contain the stigma associated with contamination from the bodily by-products of birth. In India, for example, the local birth attendants, dais, are generally from the lowest caste (Rai 2007:177; van Hollen 2003). Even in Western biomedical settings, health care providers and a woman\u2019s relatives act to mitigate their contamination from women\u2019s bodily fluids due to concerns about germs or infection, but Callaghan (2007) argues, also due to much older, ingrained ideas about the inherently polluting nature of women\u2019s bodies that continue to float below the surface of action and thought. In West Africa, a history of menstrual taboos or seclusion practices and other taboos related to sex or reproduction may hint at beliefs regarding the underlying dangers of exposing others to the products of women\u2019s bodies (Sterner and David 1991; Strassmann 1992), even if these practices are not in place any longer. It should be noted that restrictions related to menstruation, for example, are not universally damaging to women (Buckley and Gottlieb, 1988). With the spread of biomedicine and its conceptions of microscopic agents of infection (viruses and bacteria) has come a newer understanding of what might be hiding in the substances produced by bodies, particularly women\u2019s bodies\u2014in this case, infectious, potentially deadly pathogens such as HIV, Ebola, hepatitis, and others.",

Compounding the hemorrhaging that accompanied delivery in women with Ebola infections was the occurrence of obstetric emergencies that could occur in any cohort of women during pregnancy or in labor. These included such hemorrhagic events as placental abruptions (or abruptio placentae; the premature separation of the placenta before or during labor), placenta previa, retained products of conception, rupture of the uterus, cervical lacerations, ruptured ectopic pregnancy, incomplete abortions, and others (Bolkan 2017). There are no statistics available detailing the prevalence of the problem of obstetrical hemorrhage with Ebola infection, but there are published reports. The chief of ActionAid in Liberia, Korto Williams, has stated, \u201cBut we know that many women have had to give birth on their own because people were afraid they had Ebola and women have died because of a lack of care\u201d (Boseley 2014). Korto Williams also said that there are online videos showing women giving birth in the streets alone and without assistance because bystanders were scared they were infected with Ebola (Feminist Newswire 2014). Some women were unable to leave quarantine to give birth (Boseley 2014). The inexperienced staff members found themselves having to risk contamination by caring for a pregnant woman who they believed would die regardless of treatment, thus also wasting valuable supplies and medicines (Lang 2014). The conditions in many clinics and hospitals, overwhelmed with providing care and housing for patients with Ebola, resulted in providers discouraging pregnant women from receiving antenatal care or giving birth within their walls as a result of fear of bodily fluids (Feminist Newswire 2014). There were reports of some clinics and hospitals refusing to admit Ebola-infected pregnant women into their Ebola wards with other patients. At the West Point maternity ward in Monrovia, the staff turned away pregnant women with red eyes and weakness, symptoms of Ebola infection, who were seeking maternity care. A staff nurse there, Tarpeh, said \u201cWe are afraid-o, sister. If I had money to sustain my family for six months, I would go home. I\u2019m not lying to you\u201d (Moore 2014). Based upon interviews with nurses caring for Ebola patients in Sierra Leone, the magazine New Yorker reported that an unofficial protocol developed among health workers in that nation: deny infected pregnant women access to Ebola wards, or if entry was permitted, triage them last (Lang 2014). It was reported from Liberia that rumors were common that most health workers who became infected with Ebola virus contracted the disease as a result of caring for pregnant women\u2014it is well-known that this is how the American physician, Dr. Rick Sacra, who was equipped with full personal protective equipment, became infected in August 2014 (Dantzer 2015).",

There\u2019s no protective equipment, and the lives of those health care workers are threatened\u201d (Moore 2014). In addition to the lack of personal protective equipment, nurses often faced stigma within their own families or communities due to their exposure or potential exposure to the deadly virus (Hewlett and Hewlett 2005; McMahon et al. 2016).",

            "text": "In Monrovia, Fatuma Fofana was a 34-year-old mother of five who was pregnant with her sixth child when she developed severe abdominal pain. Her brother Sheriff took her to a nearby clinic, but they refused to see her\u2014the staff was terrified that she might have Ebola infection. Her brother took her to two other clinics, where she was also refused treatment . Finally, a fourth clinic let them in, but by that time her baby had died\u2014and she did not have Ebola. The staff member did not have the supplies to further treat her and the retained dead infant , so Sheriff called numerous doctors, prepared to offer them a large sum of money ($400 USD). But no doctor answered his calls, and his sister died, adding to the maternal mortality of the epidemic (Moore 2014). Stories abound of uninfected pregnant women who died as a result of pregnancy complications or miscarriages because they could not get health care. Fatuma\u2019s story, similar to Comfort Fayiah\u2019s above, also demonstrates an additional burden on poor women; even though her brother was prepared to offer a very large sum of money for her care, it was still impossible to get appropriate medical attention. For many other women and their families, such sums of money would be absolutely out of their reach. Under more normal circumstances (i.e., without the added stressors of a highly fatal epidemic), a family might fundraise from relatives and/or neighbors and friends to acquire enough money for treatment. However, with so many people infected, and rapidly deteriorating infrastructure making daily life more difficult than normal, this network might, logically, rapidly start to fray and become less reliable. It must be considered that women coming from wealthier families would not only have more cultural capital to exert when trying to access care during pregnancy or while giving birth, but would have more physical capital to put on the line in the search for care, as well. Women and families with more funds would be able to pay higher costs that might be charged for scarce medical supplies or that might be given as incentives for transportation or health care services. This differential access to capital would further enlarge the already present gap between those women living at a subsistence level and those who might be considered more middle or upper middle class in these countries. Being able to put resources on the line in the effort to attain care could possibly have helped to mitigate the stigma associated with pregnant women and treating them. However, the story of Fatuma suggests that pregnant women were so highly feared and stigmatized that even large sums of money could not induce health care workers to overcome this stigma.",

            "text": "In some cases of pregnant women who arrived at a clinic or hospital with an urgent pregnancy complication which included bleeding, a common pregnancy-related occurrence with or without Ebola infection, there was a delay in their initial evaluation and treatment. The staff were hesitant to expose themselves to potentially infectious bodily fluids, and there were delays while waiting for the results of testing for the Ebola virus. Dr. Benjamin Black, an obstetrician, has said that poor infrastructure and limited access to laboratory services meant that test results for suspected Ebola patients could take more than 24 h to arrive, during which time a woman and her fetus could die (Guilbert 2015). Poor infrastructure was one of the significant factors in these countries that caused them to be ripe for the spread of this epidemic. While many knew this weak infrastructure was already a barrier to significant improvement in a diverse array of health outcomes in these countries, the Ebola outbreak threw this into stark relief, drastically highlighting the shortcomings and inefficiencies of the preexisting weak health care sector. The existing social inequalities and health system weaknesses helped contribute to the forms of stigma affecting pregnant women, which we have discussed here.",

            "text": "Despite many of the representations, if we look deeper, pregnant women were not only victims of stigma, but perpetrators, as well. They avoided health facilities and health care workers due to their associations with the disease and its spread. Avoidance of facilities and distrust of health care workers thought to have almost certainly been exposed to Ebola led to the almost complete erasure of previous gains in maternal health outcomes. In a mutually reinforcing cycle, health care workers feared and shunned pregnant women and pregnant women avoided providers and facilities. These forms of stigmatization had fertile ground in which to prosper due to the preexisting health system weaknesses in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone, compounded by the rapid spread of the epidemic. Gender inequalities meant women had, at least during the first part of the epidemic, a greater risk of contracting Ebola and worse outcomes when they became infected. Pregnant women, both in 2013\u20132015 and moving forward in time, perhaps suffered the greatest burden through near 100% fatality when infected, but also through the reduction in obstetric services of any kind. It will doubtlessly take these countries several years to recover from the impact of the epidemic and pregnant women will continue to suffer the consequences via a decimated health care profession and weakened networks of care and services. In what was perhaps the most shocking example of the stigma related to pregnant women, health care workers, and EBV infection, one of TIME Magazine\u2019s \u201cPeople of the Year\u201d from 2014, an \u201cEbola Fighter,\u201d Salome Karwah, who was a nursing assistant and herself an Ebola survivor , died on February 21, 2017, due to complications following the Cesarean delivery of her third child (Baker 2017). Karwah used the lasting immunity from her previous Ebola infection to care for patients during the epidemic whom no one else would touch. The outbreak also claimed many of her immediate relatives, including her father who was also a physician (Baker 2017). Of Salome\u2019s death following her son\u2019s birth, Baker (2017) writes, \u201cWithin hours of coming home, Karwah lapsed into convulsions. Her husband and her sister rushed her back to the hospital, but no one would touch her. Her foaming mouth and violent seizures panicked the staff. \u2018They said she was an Ebola survivor,\u2019 says her sister by telephone. \u2018They didn\u2019t want contact with her fluids. They all gave her distance. No one would give her an injection.\u2019\u201d Salome\u2019s sister directly pointed to stigma associated with Ebola as a cause of Salome\u2019s death. An MSF health promoter, Ella Watson-Stryker, who worked with Salome during the outbreak said, \u201cTo survive Ebola and then die in the larger yet silent epidemic of health system failure\u2026 I have no words\u201d (Baker 2017). News of Salome\u2019s death spread around the world due to her appearance on the cover of TIME, but she holds a place for the unknown number of pregnant women who died during, and after, the 2013\u20132015 epidemic due to the effects of stigma and fear.",
