This also applies to work with psychiatric patients.Hospital shoes, for own use, are used only in the hospital. Change to hospital shoes and place private one in the locker when arriving the hospital.Use the hospital\u2019s socks, especially if not shoe cover heel and toe.It is not allowed to use jewellery at all work with patients or equipment (finger rings, bracelets, necklaces, all kinds of earrings and all other jewellery). Piercing is not allowed. Jewellery leads to increased bacterial growth [10, 11].It is not allowed to use the wristwatch at point of care or work with equipment as it increases the bacterial load on the hands [12].Nails should be short and clean. Artificial nails are not allowed [10, 11].Long hair is collected and secured. There can often be large amounts of bacteria in the hair.If covering the hair for religious reasons: use the hospital fabrics (hijab). The use of own hijab or headscarf is not allowed. The head restraints are changed daily and connected in such a way that the \u201csnaps\u201d do not hang down the front of the uniform and contaminate.Shift work clothes if contaminated with biological material.Surgical personnel and anaesthesiologists have a particular responsibility to follow the hospital\u2019s uniform routines\u2014see the surgical department.Work clothes should be of sturdy yet dense material resistant to washing at 85 \u00b0C for at least 10 min and to disinfectants and frequent washing. All washing of outfits and other fabrics must be done in approved laundries for hospital textiles.Work attire should not be taken home and washed there because of the risk of spreading disease.Work attire should be comfortable and not trigger allergies.By care of patients, use care coat with long sleeves and cuff. These may be used in a blue or other specific colour and be patient bound.Use cover coat or disposable plastic aprons at work where there is danger of soiling of the ordinary work clothes.By care of infectious isolated patients, use yellow infection coats with long sleeves, cuffs at the wrist without pockets and with closing behind.Infection coats and care coats must be replaced daily or immediately if visible soiling or soaking. An advantage in work with infectious cases is the use of yellow, disposable coats changed after each use.Clean work clothes to prevent the spread of infection and to reduce bacterial load on the hands [13].\n",
