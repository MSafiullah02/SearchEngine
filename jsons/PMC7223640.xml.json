The primary benefit of HCP vaccination is personal protection against influenza, but this can lead to the secondary benefit of protecting patients from influenza infections transmitted by HCP. An observational study among elderly patients in long-term care found that HCP vaccination decreased patient mortality, but vaccination of patients was not associated with the same decrease in mortality, likely due to inadequate immune response after vaccination by the patients [7]. Cluster randomized trials in long-term care facilities found that increases in HCP vaccination led to decreases in mortality [8, 9], influenza-like illness [9], and hospitalizations for influenza-like illness [9]. While no randomized trials have been performed in the acute care setting, similar findings have been noted in observational studies. In two observational studies, increasing the HCP influenza vaccination rate was associated with a significant decrease in the rate of nosocomial influenza infections at two separate acute care hospitals [10, 11]. The converse phenomenon has also been observed, in which a decrease in HCP influenza vaccination from 13.2 to 3.2% over a 7-year period was associated with a significant increase in the rate of nosocomial influenza infections in an acute care hospital [12]. A case-control study of nosocomial influenza found a median HCP vaccination rate of 11.5% on the units with the nosocomial influenza cases and a median rate of 36.1% on the units with the controls [13].",

            "text": "One explanation for the effectiveness of HCP vaccination in preventing cases of nosocomial influenza is likely tied into the concept of presenteeism, in which ill employees come to work while sick. Multiple surveys of HCP have revealed that the majority of respondents come to work when sick with a respiratory infection [14\u201317]. Commonly reported reasons for working while sick included obligations to colleagues, obligations to patient care, and sick leave structures that can end up penalizing HCPs for taking time off [14, 17, 18]. Most of these surveys have focused on physicians, but a study in a long-term care facility also found 89% of the HCPs with acute respiratory infections worked while ill [19]. Depending on workplace policies, HCPs may have limited allocated sick days and may feel a financial incentive to work while sick. A survey regarding pandemic influenza mitigation recommendations found that 28% of respondents felt that they would lose their job if they had to stay home for 7 to 10 days, and those who earned less than $75,000 per year were more likely to report some degree of financial hardship from staying home [20].",

Once British Columbia moved to a province-wide mandatory HCP vaccination or masking policy, they found that HCP who were vaccinated early took less sick time than those who were vaccinated late or not at all [24]. In an observational study of multiple health care systems, systems with mandatory vaccination policies had lower rates of symptomatic absenteeism [25]. A randomized controlled trial in pediatric hospitals showed that influenza vaccination did not decrease the number of episodes or days of respiratory infections, but it did decrease the number of days of work lost due to respiratory infection [26]. Reducing the rate of absenteeism can have a significant impact on patient care. A nosocomial influenza outbreak in one unit of one acute care hospital in France led to 14 person-days of sick leave, postponing 8 scheduled admissions, suspending emergency admissions for 11 days, and an increased average charge per infected patient of $3798 [27].",

            "text": "Despite the ACIP recommendations and the evidence of benefit in reducing nosocomial influenza, national influenza vaccination rates among HCP still fall short of the 90% goal [5]. In the 2017\u20132018 influenza season, 78.4% of HCP reported having received a vaccine [28\u2022]. The rate has increased from the 2010\u20132011 season but has been flat over the past 4 influenza seasons. Vaccination rates are highest among hospitals, followed by ambulatory/office settings, and lowest in the long-term care setting [28\u2022]. Physicians have the highest vaccination rates, followed by pharmacists, nurses, and nurse practitioners/physician assistants, while non-clinical personnel and aides have the lowest rates [28\u2022]. When HCP are surveyed about their reasons for declining vaccination, common responses include a perception that the vaccine is unsafe, a perception that the vaccine is unreliable, fear of adverse effects, lack of time to get a vaccine, and forgetting to get a vaccine [29]. A variety of methods have been used to improve vaccine uptake among HCP, specifically targeting these issues, including educational campaigns, tracking rates of vaccine uptake, mobile vaccine carts, mandatory declination, peer-to-peer vaccination efforts, and vaccination stations at healthcare facility entrances [10, 11, 30, 31].",

Some terminate employees that do not receive a vaccine or get an approved exemption [33, 34].

Healthcare facilities with mandatory policies have higher HCP vaccination rates than those without a mandatory policy [25]. Even in settings in which other methods have been used to increase vaccination rates, requiring non-vaccinated employees to wear masks during influenza season may be associated with an increase in vaccine uptake. In one German hospital, a masking policy for non-vaccinated employees led to an improvement in vaccination rate from 33 to 51.7% in the first 10 days after implementation of the policy [35]. Feeling uncomfortable while wearing a mask was associated with increased odds of getting vaccinated [29]. Other consequences for non-vaccination also influence HCP vaccination rates. A linear model estimated that termination for noncompliance increased vaccination rates by 12.8 percentage points and consequences other than termination by11.5 percentage points [36]. In the study where vaccination rates were linked to budget allocations in academic departments, that policy increased the vaccination rates among HCP in the school of medicine from 77.5 to 93.7% [30].",
