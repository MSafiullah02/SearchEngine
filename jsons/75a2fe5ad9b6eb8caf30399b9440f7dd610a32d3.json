Shared niches are expected to facilitate interspecific interactions which may lead to linked population dynamics among distinct pathogen species (1, 2) . In the context of respiratory infections, a well-known example is the coseasonality of influenza and pneumococcus, driven by an enhanced susceptibility to secondary bacterial colonization subsequent to influenza infection (3, 4) . Indeed, respiratory bacteria-bacteria and bacteria-virus interactions, and the underlying mechanisms by which they arise, are extensively studied (5) (6) (7) (8) . In contrast, evidence for the occurrence of virus-virus interactions remains scarce and the potential mechanisms are elusive, demanding greater research attention.",

            "text": "The role of adaptive immunity in driving virus interferences that alter the population dynamics of antigenically similar virus strains is well known (18, 19) . For example, antibody-driven cross-immunity is believed to restrict influenza virus strain diversity, leading to sequential strain replacement over time (20) . Such antibody-driven virus interactions might even shape the temporal patterns of RSV, human parainfluenza virus (PIV), and human metapneumovirus (MPV) infections, which are taxonomically grouped into the same virus family (21) . However, where antigenically distant virus groups are concerned, the mechanisms are obscure, although the variety of possibilities includes innate immunity, resource competition, and other cellular Significance When multiple pathogens cocirculate this can lead to competitive or cooperative forms of pathogen-pathogen interactions. It is believed that such interactions occur among cold and flu viruses, perhaps through broad-acting immunity, resulting in interlinked epidemiological patterns of infection. However, to date, quantitative evidence has been limited. We analyzed a large collection of diagnostic reports collected over multiple years for 11 respiratory viruses. Our analyses provide strong statistical support for the existence of interactions among respiratory viruses. Using computer simulations, we found that very short-lived interferences may explain why common cold infections are less frequent during flu seasons. Improved understanding of how the epidemiology of viral infections is interlinked can help improve disease forecasting and evaluation of disease control interventions.",

Each patient was tested for 11 virus groups (28, 29) , providing a single, coherent data source for the epidemiological examination of infection dynamics of both cocirculating viruses in general and coinfection patterns in individual patients. Using these data, our study addresses the following questions: 1) Is there statistical evidence of virus-virus interactions in the temporal patterns of infection at the population scale?, 2) Is there statistical evidence of virus-virus interactions in coinfection patterns at the individual host scale?, and 3) Is a shortlived immune-mediated interference at the scale of individual hosts sufficient to induce asynchronous seasonal patterns of infection at the population scale?",

The estimated cross-correlations fall outside the 2.5% and 97.5% quantile intervals of correlation distributions generated under the null hypothesis of no interaction (see SI Appendix, Tables S1 and S2 and Methods for details). How-ever, examining whether these are genuine virus-virus interactions (mediated at either the host or population level) required us to address several methodological limitations in this relatively simple approach: It fails to account for autocorrelation in the time series of individual viruses, or for potentially confounding factors which might independently explain correlations, and it can produce spurious negative correlations with proportional data or, alternatively, spurious positive correlations with absolute infection counts.",

For example, viral exposure events may be seasonally (anti-) correlated due to similarities (differences) in the climatic preferences of viruses (25, 26) , and, in some cases, due to age-dependent contact patterns driven by extensive mixing of children in daycare centers and schools (27, 28) .

We then applied Holm's method (34) to control the familywise error rate. This confirmed the existence of 2 within-host interactions: a negative interaction between IAV and RV (OR = 0.27, P < 0.001) and a positive interaction between AdV and PIVB (OR = 3.99, P < 0.001).

Our statistical analyses provide strong support for a negative interaction between seasonal IAV and the relatively ubiquitous RV, at both population and individual host scales. This negative interaction may be driven by virus competition for susceptible cells, for example as a consequence of influenza-induced destruction of cellsurface receptors (35) and/or cell death (36) , or as a consequence of virus-induced innate immune responses, such as the secretion of interferon (IFN), which can cause noninfected neighboring cells to adopt a protective antiviral state (23, 24) . Such biological mechanisms would render the host resistant, or only partially susceptible, to subsequent viral infection. This prompted us to ask whether a short-lived, host-scale phenomenon could explain the prominent declines in the prevalence of RV among the patient population during peak influenza activity ( Fig. 2A) .",

Our simulations show that a temporary reduction in host susceptibility to a secondary common cold-like virus infection, a \"refractory period,\" caused by a primary influenza-like virus infection is sufficient to produce an observable epidemiological impact. For example, a refractory period of just 2 d caused a 23% decrease in common cold-like virus incidence during peak influenza-like virus activity, while a refractory period of 7 d generated as much as a 61% decrease in common cold-like virus incidence (Fig. 5A) . Notably, these simulations produced asynchronous temporal patterns of infection qualitatively similar to our empirical observations, such that the periodic decline in common cold-like virus infections coincides with peak influenza-like virus activity (Fig. 5B ).",

Capturing this potentially immunemediated interference in mathematical simulations representing the cocirculation of a seasonal influenza-like virus and a ubiquitous common cold-like virus, we demonstrated that a short-lived protective effect, such as that induced by IFN (25) , is sufficient to induce the observed asynchronous seasonal patterns we observe for IAV and RV ( Fig. 2A) . Many factors could contribute to interferences observed at the population scale through the removal of susceptible hosts (1, 38) .

That they differ in their exact pairwise interactions is unsurprising when considering that these viruses are antigenically distinct, constitute different taxonomical genera, and exhibit different viral evolutionary rates (20, 42) , as well as differences in their respective age distributions of infection and some aspects of clinical presentation (43, 44) . Furthermore, these viruses exhibit inconsistent patterns of cocirculation (45) (46) (47) (see also SI Appendix, Fig. S1 ) and thus their cooccurrence with other respiratory viruses is expected to vary. Based on these differences between IAV and IBV, it is feasible that their ecological relationships with other viruses have evolved differently. Of further note is the lack of interaction detected between IAV and IBV, since there is some suggestion from global data of a short lag between their outbreak peaks. However, epidemiological data are inconsistent in that they report both asynchrony and codominance (46, 47) . We believe that a lack of confirmation of interference between IAV and IBV is consistent with current virological understanding. These viruses are genetically and antigenically different; although studies have identified cross-reactive B cell and T cell epitopes in conserved regions of the viral genome (48), sufficient natural cross-protection has not been demonstrated (48, 49) . It is, however, possible that their ecological relationship depends on the particular strains cocirculating. Further work is needed to better understand how the existence and nature of virus-virus interactions varies at the level of virus strains. On the other hand, some evidence exists in support of immune-driven interference between H1N1 and H3N2 subtypes of influenza A (46, 47) . Our data did not permit reliable analysis at this level of virus differentiation because low and inconsistent numbers of influenza cases were routinely subtyped.",

Although an interference between RSV and IAV has been proposed (9, 11, 48), a hypothesis recently supported in an experimental ferret model (21) , this was not supported by our data. It is possible that such an effect was masked because our analysis did not enable stratification of effects by age, a step that is anticipated to severely limit the statistical power of our highly comprehensive analysis of virus-virus interactions.

This finding is consistent with a recent, smaller-scale clinical study of children diagnosed with pneumonia, which detected 2 pairs of positively associated noninfluenza viruses (17) . Plausible mechanisms of positive virus-virus interactions include enhanced viral growth through syncytia formation of a coinfecting virus (22) , the virusmediated down-regulation of IFN, which may promote invasion by opportunistic viruses (41) , and the virus-induced release of cytokines such as interleukin 10, which prevents the detrimental effects of dysregulated immune responses and might lead to immunosuppression and enhanced susceptibility to secondary viral infections (53, 54) . That most interactions detected at the host scale were not supported at the population level is not surprising given that interaction effects are reliant on coinfection, or sequential infections, occurring within a short time frame.

The virusvirus interactions we detect may represent a \"net effect\" of the evolutionary processes (55) driving the virus strains circulating in the UK population over the 9-y timeframe of this study. It should also be borne in mind that a large proportion of respiratory infections, including influenza, are expected to be asymptomatic (56) , and coinfections of some viruses may be associated with attenuated disease (23, 57) .

The method employs Poisson regression to model observed monthly infection counts adjusting for confounding covariates and underlying test frequencies. This framework uses a multivariate normal distribution to model the random temporal variation in the adjusted virus counts, naturally incorporating a betweenvirus covariance matrix that enabled estimation of virus-virus correlations. Through estimating, and scaling, the off-diagonal entries of this matrix, we were able to estimate posterior interval estimates for correlations between each virus pair. Under a Bayesian framework, posterior probabilities were estimated to assess the probability of zero being included in each interval The R 0 s of these viruses assuming a completely susceptible homogeneous population are 1.6 (virus 1) and 2 (virus 2). The model supports the hypothesis that temporary nonspecific protection elicited by influenza explains the periodic decline in rhinovirus frequency during peak influenza activity ( Fig. 2A) .",

Our approach was, for each study virus (Y) in turn, to restrict the analysis to patients positive for one of the other (explanatory) viruses, thereby eliminating the influence of the underrepresentation of the virus-negative \"healthy\" population, implicit in the patient-based study population. The study population comprised individuals infected with at least one other (non-Y) virus. Within that group, exposed individuals were positive to virus X, and unexposed individuals were negative to virus X. Cases were coinfected with virus Y, while controls were negative to virus Y. In this way, our analysis quantifies whether the propensity of virus X to coinfect with virus Y was more, less, or equal to the overall propensity of any (remaining) virus group to coinfect with Y. Our study therefore infers signatures of virusvirus interactions from the nonrandom patterns of virus mixing among the viruspositive population.",

The quality of each model was assessed by the predictive power given by the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve. Because these data do not allow for inferences of the directionality of the virus-virus interactions, we conducted all possible 72 pairwise statistical tests in the first instance to evaluate 36 virus-pair hypotheses and present results where ORs yield unadjusted P < 0.05. These analyses detected 17 significant virus-virus interaction (4 negative and 13 positive) out of the 72 tests (SI Appendix, Tables S15 and S16). Not all virus-pair interactions were bidirectional; however, we note that these analyses do not allow the differentiation of cause from effect. Applying Holm's method to control the probability of one or more false discoveries arising among the family of 72 tests [using the p.adjust function in R version 3.4.4 (61) ] yielded strong evidence (P < 0.001 following correction) of the existence of both negative (IAV/RV) and positive (AdV/PIVB) interactions (see SI Appendix, Table S17 for details). A permutation test of the global null hypothesis was then applied to the 5 remaining virus groups (IBV, CoV, MPV, RSV, and PIVA) to test the hypothesis that the 20 remaining null hypotheses tested were true. Using Fisher's method of combining P values (62), we found strong evidence of association among these 5 virus groups (P = 0.0021; SI Appendix, Fig. S2 ), although we expect nonindependence between these tests. We therefore accounted for nonindependence among the pairwise tests by using permutations to simulate the null distribution of combined P values. Each generalized linear model was fitted to 10,000 datasets where the null hypothesis was simulated by permuting the response variable (virus Y). The significant tendency of the distribution of P values toward zero (and away from the uniform distribution expected under the null hypothesis) was illustrated using a quantile-quantile (QQ) plot to compare the 20 observed P values with the 10,000 distributions simulated under the global null hypothesis (Fig. 3C) . The signal of additional interactions was further demonstrated when the permutation test of the global null hypothesis was extended to all 72 tests (SI Appendix, Fig. S3 )-only 3 (95% CI: 0 to 9) interactions were expected by chance assuming the null hypothesis of no interactions, in comparison to the 17 interactions we detected.",
