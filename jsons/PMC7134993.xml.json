An audit of hospital admissions showed that around 30% of patients presenting with an index exacerbation will be seen again and possibly readmitted with another (or recurrent) event within 8 weeks.4 In a cohort of patients with moderate to severe COPD followed-up after exacerbation, 22% had a recurrent event within 50 days of the first (index) exacerbation. Thus, such events are complex, and an initial exacerbation seems to increase susceptibility to a subsequent one.5\n",

Additionally, many COPD exacerbations are not reported to health-care professionals and are either self-treated or left untreated.1 The latest GOLD guidelines also indicate that exacerbations can be self-limiting, especially if of mild severity, and the phrase \u201cmay warrant a change in regular medication\u201d has been incorporated.7 However, health-care use can be used to define exacerbation severity: often defined as mild if increases in regular inhaled medication are needed, moderate if courses of steroids or antibiotics are needed, and severe if the patient requires hospital admission.",

Hurst and colleagues8 did a large study of plasma biomarkers for COPD exacerbations, with 36 candidate molecules assessed in paired baseline and exacerbation plasma samples, and tested against a standard definition, meeting both health-care use and symptom-based criteria. To confirm the diagnosis of exacerbation, the most selective biomarker was C-reactive protein (CRP) but this was neither sufficiently sensitive nor specific alone. However, the combination of CRP with any increased major exacerbation symptom on that day (dyspnoea, sputum volume, or sputum purulence) increased the sensitivity and specificity. Further research will aid in the understanding of mechanisms of COPD exacerbations and will lead to the development of more specific biomarkers.",

In stable COPD there is an increase in the CD8+ lymphocytes and macrophages in the bronchial mucosa and an increase in neutrophils with more severe disease.14 In one study, where biopsies were done at exacerbation in patients with chronic bronchitis, increased airway eosinophilia was reported, although the patients studied had only mild COPD.10 Modest increases were seen in neutrophils, T lymphocytes (CD3), and TNF alpha positive cells. However, in patients with more severe COPD, increases have been seen in airway neutrophils when stable that increase further at exacerbation.10, 11, 12 Qiu and colleagues11 have studied biopsies from patients with severe COPD, who were treated at exacerbation with tracheal intubation, and showed that there was pronounced airway neutrophilia, neutrophil elastase expression, and upregulation of neutrophil chemokine expression. However, studies in intubated patients with COPD are difficult, since the results can be complicated by secondary infection. Oxidative stress is a key factor in the development of airway inflammation in COPD. A study has shown that patients with severe exacerbations who needed hospital admission or assisted ventilation have evidence of increased large airway interleukin-8 (IL-8) levels and increased oxidative stress.12 Various markers of oxidative stress have been shown to rise in the airways with exacerbation such as hydrogen peroxide and 8-isoprostane and these markers can take some time to recover to baseline.15 Upper airway inflammation is increased in COPD patients, increases further at exacerbation, and is associated with lower airway inflammatory changes.13, 16\n",

Changes in exhaled nitric oxide also occur and are greater in the presence of viral infections, but are not suitable for monitoring of current exacerbations.20 Novel physiological methods to monitor exacerbations are being developed, and some data now suggest that inspiratory capacity measurements21 or within-breath forced oscillation measurements22 might be more useful to assess COPD exacerbations and indicate the degree of physiological impairment.",

There have been few such studies in the developing world, but a study from Hong Kong detected viruses in only 22% of exacerbations.29 However, this study differed from others in the choice of assay and in that samples were taken from the upper airway rather than directly from the lower airway. A smaller study of 14 COPD patients admitted to hospital in Singapore reported that 64% of COPD exacerbations were associated with viruses although, like the Hong Kong study, most were associated with influenza virus,30 which was possibly due to less frequent use of the influenza vaccine.",

A study investigating the benefit of antibiotics in more than 300 acute exacerbations showed a greater treatment success rate in patients treated with antibiotics, especially if their initial presentation was with the symptoms of increased dyspnoea, sputum volume, and purulence, than in patients who did not receive such treatment.40 Patients with mild COPD obtained less benefit from antibiotic therapy than those with more severe COPD. The results of a meta-analysis have shown that antibiotic treatment offered a small but significant benefit in treatment failure and mortality.41\n",

This observation might be due to the fact that not all exacerbations recover to baseline levels of symptoms and lung function.3 The results of one audit showed that around 30% of patients seen at hospital with an index exacerbation will be seen again and possibly readmitted with a recurrent exacerbation within 8 weeks.62 Patients with a history of frequent exacerbations also have increased airway inflammation,9 which could also contribute to the disease progression.63 Why some patients have frequent exacerbations is not clear, although they possibly have increased susceptibility to respiratory viral infection.25 Thus this group of COPD patients is important for targeting interventions that have the potential of reducing exacerbation frequency.",

One of the early studies, the ISOLDE (Inhaled Steroid in Obstructive Lung Disease in Europe) study, was a 3-year study, powered to detect a significant change in FEV1 decline, was negative for the primary outcome but showed that exacerbation frequency can be reduced with inhaled steroids by about 25%.74 Generally the effect of inhaled steroids was greater in patients with more impaired lung function, suggesting that this is the group to target with long-term inhaled steroid therapy.89 In another study from the USA90 (The Lung Health Study), the inhaled steroid (triamcinolone) group had significantly fewer visits to a physician due to respiratory illness, suggesting that triamcinolone also reduced the frequency of COPD exacerbations.",

In another study comparing salmeterol with the short-acting ipratropium and placebo, there was no difference in the effect in either treatment arm on exacerbation frequency.94 Rossi and colleagues95 compared two different dosages of the inhaled bronchodilator formoterol with placebo or theophylline and concluded that formoterol was more effective and better tolerated than therapeutically appropriate doses of oral slow-release theophylline in symptomatic COPD patients. Furthermore, two studies reported that formoterol had no effect on total exacerbation frequency relative to placebo, though these studies did find that the rates of steroid-treated exacerbations were decreased in the formoterol group.96, 97\n",

Thus, inhaled steroids are unlikely to be used as sole therapy for COPD patients in the future. The data from the TORCH study have confirmed the effectiveness of the inhaled steroid-LABA combination in reducing exacerbation frequency, and the study has reported that the combination reduces hospital admission rates in COPD patients.93 However, most of these studies have been done in patients with more severe COPD with an FEV1 at less than 60% predicted (figure 4\n). The effect of the inhaled steroid-LABA combination on reducing exacerbations in patients with milder COPD is not clear, especially in those patients who have an increased exacerbation frequency.",

However, a trend was seen in the reduction of the number of exacerbations with the triple combination, which failed to reach significance possibly due to the small size of the study and the high dropout rate.

Two new receptor-specific phosphodiesterase inhibitors have been studied in COPD: cilomilast and roflumilast, which are both phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors. A trial of cilomilast in COPD patients showed reduction in exacerbations in the cilomilast group.104 Two studies of roflumilast in COPD have been recently reported: Rabe and colleagues105 have reported a reduction in exacerbations after 24 weeks therapy with roflumilast, while Calverley and colleagues106 studied roflumilast in patients with GOLD stage III and IV in a 1-year trial and showed no overall effect on exacerbation rate, although patients with severe disease (GOLD stage IV) had fewer during the study period.

However, in view of the presence of lower airway bacterial colonisation in these patients111 and data from Patel and colleagues112 that such colonisation is related to exacerbation frequency, there has been renewed interest in this type of intervention and some continuing studies will soon be reporting their findings.",

This finding suggests that a course of pulmonary rehabilitation might reduce exacerbation severity rather than frequency by increasing the patient's knowledge of COPD and how to access health care or self-manage during an exacerbation. Pulmonary rehabilitation could thus reduce hospital stay but also encourage early presentation for exacerbation therapy, which reduces exacerbation length and thus the severity of the event.115\n",

After the early experience of domiciliary long-term non-invasive ventilation in patients with chest wall and neuromuscular disease, non-invasive ventilation has also been assessed in patients with hypercapnic COPD. Early observations on the effect of non-invasive ventilation in COPD showed a significant beneficial effect on health status, although data for exacerbations were not recorded.124 Because health status is such an important determinant of exacerbation frequency,1 improvement in health status could be due to a reduction of exacerbation frequency. In a controlled study lasting a year, no effect was seen of non-invasive ventilation on exacerbations but there was a reduction in hospital admission at the 3-month follow-up point.125 Thus, larger controlled studies are now required to assess the effect of non-invasive ventilation on exacerbation in hypercapnic COPD patients, particularly at risk of hospital admission.",

We also searched the reference lists of articles identified by this search strategy and selected those we judged relevant. Decisions to include specific references were based on authors' knowledge of published work, participation in expert meetings, and many years of research on the subject. Thus, this work is not an exhaustive systematic review of the burden and prevention of COPD exacerbations.
