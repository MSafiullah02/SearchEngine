European countries currently have the greatest percentage of population aged \u226560 (25%). Rapid ageing will also soon occur in other parts of the world, and by 2050 all regions except Africa will have nearly a quarter or more of their populations \u226560 [1]. Population ageing is projected to have a profound effect on societies by increasing demand on fiscal, political, healthcare, and social protection systems of many countries in coming decades. China will be one of the countries affected.",

These infections occur during healthcare delivery for other diseases and even after discharge. HAIs are associated with prolonged hospital stay, poor prognosis, and increased mortality and economic burden [2\u20134]. A systematic review and meta-analysis reported that the major risk factors independently associated with HAIs were diabetes mellitus, immunosuppression, body temperature, surgery time in minutes, reoperation, cephalosporin exposure, days of exposure to central venous catheter, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, ICU stay in days, and mechanical ventilation [5]. Moreover, invasive devices such as catheters, ventilators, and central lines are associated with HAIs. The elderly are particularly vulnerable to infections due to reduced immunological competence and a high risk of underlying chronic illness [6\u201310]. However, there are limited data available regarding HAIs in elderly inpatients. Here we describe and analyze the results of a 3-year real-time surveillance study on the incidence of HAIs and the epidemiological and clinical characteristics of elderly inpatients in a large tertiary hospital in China.",
