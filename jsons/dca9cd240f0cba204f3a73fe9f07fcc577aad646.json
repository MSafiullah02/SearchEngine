All coronaviruses have an envelope with radiating structures composed of trimers of the 220 kDa spike glycoprotein (S, also referred to as peplomer E2), as well as the smaller membrane glycoprotein (M, 29-36 kDa) and envelope protein (E1, 10 kDa) ( Fig. 8.1 ). The M protein interacts with the nucleocapsid N protein and the viral RNA to form the icosahedral nucleoprotein core (Masters 2006) . The S-protein, specifically the N-terminal domain between amino acids 522-744, binds aminopeptidase N receptor in the epithelium of the small intestine and mediates the fusion of the host and viral membranes and uptake (Belouzard et al. 2012 ).",

The M protein induces interferon production and also binds neutralizing antibodies (Laude et al. 1992 ). The S (or E2) protein has been found to be the most effective epitope at inducing neutralizing antibodies. The S-protein has four major antigenic sites at the N-terminal: A, B, C, and D; A and D are involved in antigen neutralization (Reguera et al. 2011; Correa et al. 1988; Fig. 8 .1 Schematic of the coronavirus virion, with the minimal set of structural proteins. Reproduced with permission from Masters (2006) Jim\u00e9nez et al. 1986 ). Induction of cross-protection with the use of a related virus has been attempted. PCRV shows tropism towards respiratory tissues and differs from TGEV in having a deletion of the N-terminal 224-227 amino acids (containing antigenic sites A and D) of the S-protein, indicating that the A and D sites may be involved in tissue specificity. Immunization with PCRV was partially protective under the same conditions-33 % of piglets survived challenge (De Diego et al. 1994) . The S-antigen was therefore selected as the most efficient immunogen for a subunit vaccine.",

            "text": "High-level expression of heterologous eukaryotic proteins has been successfully attempted in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. However, many eukaryotic proteins require posttranslational modifications such as glycosylation, which are not carried out by prokaryotes, and so eukaryotic systems are sometimes necessary to obtain functional end products. The benefits of plants as production systems are primarily the low cost of production and rapid scale-up that make it more responsive than other methods to high production targets. Traits introduced by transgenic techniques into separate lines can be combined by traditional breeding methods to produce lines with a combination of these traits. The production of bulk plant material requires only space, fertile soil, and sunlight, which are less onerous to provide than sterile fermentation chambers and animal care. Plants do not harbor animal pathogens, and the concern for contamination of products with animal pathogens, such as prions or viruses, is alleviated. Plant material has been shown to serve to bioencapsulate proteins, permitting slow release in the gut (Kong et al. 2001; Verma et al. 2010; Bailey 2000) . Thus, there may be a degree of dosage flexibility with oral antigens administered in plant tissue, and the feed can be administered over a larger window to accommodate time frames for induction of secretory and humoral immunoglobulins (Bailey 2000; Daniell et al. 2001) .",

            "text": "Important considerations before attempting expression of heterologous eukaryotic proteins in plants are the requirements for posttranslational protein modifications, such as glycosylation, and the presence of allergens and toxins. Glycosylation moieties and patterns differ between animals and plants which has raised concerns over the potential for nonfunctional proteins or an allergic reaction to the plant glycosylated protein. These differences, however, do not appear to be significant functionally (Ma et al. 2003; Suzuki et al. 2003) , and plant carbohydrate-specific IgEs in allergic patients were shown to be clinically irrelevant when the protein is orally administered (Mari et al. 2008; Bosch and Schots 2010) . This lack of allergenicity may be partly explained by tolerance to plant glycosylation induced by oral exposure (see Ghaderi et al. 2012 for an overview of glycosylation of biotherapeutic proteins). Potential concerns about glycosylation-induced allergenicity may also be overcome by the removal of plant glycosylation sites, inactivation of plant glycosylases, and the expression of plant deglycosylases and mammalian-type glycosylases (Sethuraman and Stadheim 2006; Desai et al. 2010; Mamedov et al. 2012) . Host plants should also be screened for toxic or allergenic metabolites that may co-purify or be co-administered with the target protein.",

Selection and backcrossing into parent seed and hybrid lines can establish uniform concentrations of antigen expression (Hood et al. 2012) and standard processing and formulation methods can reliably produce consistent concentrations of antigens for administration, which is not straightforward with perishable edible tissues such as lettuce leaves and bananas. Bioencapsulation of the antigen in plant tissue prevents premature degradation resulting in the antigen persisting in the intestine, a key factor for the induction of a protective sIgA response, important for protection against ingested pathogens.

Aleurone grains contain enzymes involved in the breakdown of starch and proteins in the germinating seed. The embryo and endosperm are well suited to heterologous protein accumulation as both are rich in protein and have associated tissue-specific promoters. The volume of the endosperm is greater than that of the embryo allowing, in theory, more protein accumulation but, in practice, embryo-preferred promoters have been used to produce some of the highest recorded concentrations of heterologous proteins (Hood et al. 2012; Egelkrout et al. 2013) .

            "text": "The ideal vaccine for TGEV will provide mucosal, lactogenic, and systemic immunity, while being simple to administer to droves which may number in the many thousands. Potentially, the methods to protect na\u00efve piglets at highest risk from TGEV infection are to provide immune colostrum by vaccinating sows and an oral/nasal vaccine to boost secretory neutralizing antibody levels. Since TGEV is an enteric disease, the induction of sIgA is inferred to be more protective. It has been observed that the mucosal immunoglobulin, IgA, is more efficiently induced through gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) if the antigen persists in the intestine (Foss and Murtaugh 2000) . Induction of passive immunity transmitted through colostrum can be mediated by either of the soluble immunoglobulins IgG or IgA. Initially, IgG is more abundant and protects against systemic infection, whereas IgAs in colostrum provide protection to the gut lumen where the enterocytes in which TGEV replicates reside. IgA production and mucosal immunity is thus the response desired. There have been three main routes taken to effect protection in young piglets: (1) parenteral immunization with inactivated virus, (2) oral/nasal administration of attenuated virus, and (3) oral administration of viral subunit antigens in feed. Parenteral immunization of young piglets with inactivated virus is ineffective as it does not induce the local immune response in the gut, nor are piglets at this age capable of mounting an immune response. However, parenteral immunization of pregnant sows can induce production of protective immunoglobulins in colostrum and milk. The disadvantage of this approach is the necessity of individually vaccinating sows, which can be time-consuming and expensive. Immunization must also be done on a schedule prior to birth that maximizes immunoglobulin presence in the colostrum, and that can be difficult, especially with large numbers. Nasal administration of attenuated viruses does overcome this difficulty, but each pregnant animal still needs to be isolated and the vaccine delivered separately. As with parenteral injection, the vaccination schedule is important because, while the attenuated virus does replicate in the gut, thus stimulating antibody production over an extended period, viral replication is suboptimal. While the oral vaccine can be more easily administered, the frequency of inoculation has to be modulated to maximize colostrum immunoglobulin timed with birth.",

However, dosage for orally administered vaccines in feed is particularly significant, because antigens could be ingested at greater or lesser doses depending on the amount of feed consumed, and some of the antigens would be expected to be destroyed by the digestive process. The typical vaccine dosage in feed may be up to 100 times greater than that used for parenteral administration, but this may be reduced by the use of suitable targeting or carrier molecules (Carter and Langridge 2002) . Still, common consensus is that a precise dose, taking into account degradation in the gut, must be given to all animals. Interestingly, Verma et al. (2010) have shown that the response from a 20-fold range of antigen levels given encapsulated in plant materials is comparable.",

They attributed this difference to GALT being more effective than bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (BALT), going even to the extent of questioning if BALT was indeed an integral mammalian structure (Pabst 1992) . Pigs have been shown to not have BALT constitutively (Delventhal et al. 1992; Pabst and Gehrke 1990) . Thus, the use of intranasal stimulation by PCRV may have been less effective for this reason. Peyer's patches in the gut have long been known to be associated with GALT, and oral immunization has been shown to be effective in producing IgA and IgG globulins in milk and was 100 % effective in protecting 3-5 day piglets obtained from seronegative sows against challenge.

(2004) achieved levels of S-antigen expression in maize seed of 13 mg/kg. BAASS targets protein to the cell wall and is later cleaved-a process that permits higher levels of accumulation in the apoplast than is possible in the cytoplasm. Using standard plant techniques, F1 lines of maize that had high levels of expression were selected and backcrossed to commercial maize lines to obtain stable, increased levels of protein expression. Since the protein was produced in maize, a GRAS plant, further purification before oral administration was not necessary. Lamphear et al. (2002) studied the levels of serum neutralizing antibodies induced by administration of TGEV-S corn alone in piglets. 10-12-day-old TGEV seronegative piglets were divided into three groups (normal rations, control corn, TGEV-S corn) of four piglets each, with 2 mg of the antigen administered in ground corn mixed with medicated milk replacer. 8 days after the last antigen administration, the piglets were challenged with 1 mL of orally administered virulent TGEV. Serum was collected and neutralizing antibody levels measured (Fig. 8.3a) . Piglets fed TGEV-S corn showed more than tenfold greater neutralizing serum response as well as milder symptoms (a geometric mean titer of 768.5 in TGEV-S-corn fed piglets compared to titers of 64 in the control groups).

One important feature of the plant production system is that field-grown plants have the potential to pollinate other food or feed crops. The APHIS arm of the USDA issues permits for the growth of transgenic corn. These include a number of growing restrictions to prevent intermixing of the crop inadvertently with other food and feed crops. To this point, the USDA has developed a highly restrictive set of isolation conditions for growing the crop, over and above the standard conditions for producing vaccines, including a one-mile isolation corridor from other corn. As maize pollen is relatively heavy, it normally only pollinates other corn plants within a few meters (Luna et al. 2001 ) making this an extreme precaution. Nevertheless, as the growing acreage needed for such a product is low (~70,000 acres, or 0.1 % of the total acreage of corn in the USA to produce two doses of 26 mg of vaccine at 13 mg antigen/kg corn for each of the estimated 65 million swine and assuming a yield of 150 bushels/acre), it is quite reasonable to find isolated areas to grow the crop.

Furthermore, the corn itself has value as a feed product, further lowering the effective cost of the vaccine. The actual cost of the vaccine can therefore be calculated by the cost to keep the grain segregated from food and feed crops and loss in yield over commodity crops. Both of these costs are further reduced by having high levels of antigen in maize, thereby limiting the amount of corn needed to be grown.
