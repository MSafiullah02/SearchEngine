Such approaches can be either numerical (i.e., synchronous updating Monte Carlo simulations) or theoretical. In a discrete-time approach, time is discretized into time steps of length \u0394t (which usually takes the value \u0394t=1), and events occur with certain probabilities. These probabilities are known as the state transition probabilities, and are simply the product of the corresponding rate and the time step \u0394t.",

Allen, in her work [33], shows that discrete-time susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) and susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR) models can produce complex behavior such as period doubling and chaotic effects for sufficiently large values of the time step and/or contact rate. This behavior is not possible in the continuous-time SIS and SIR models, and is thus no more than an artifact of discretizing time. Similarly, Gomez et al. [39] observe that differences between continuous and discrete-time SIS dynamics are substantial when an arbitrary time step of \u0394t=1 is employed. An understanding of the discrepancies introduced as a result of discretizing time is thus important, allowing us to gauge the validity of discrete-time approaches and when they may accurately be employed.",

Our message is clear\u2013that the accuracy of such methods will be poor if state transition probabilities are too large, leading to deviations from the underlying continuous-time process. The repercussions of this are manifold. Discrete-time theoretical approaches can be significantly inaccurate for large values of the contagion parameter values (such as infection and recovery rates), and thus the analysis of such approaches will not be valid. Furthermore, discrete-time Monte Carlo simulations\u2014often used as a gold standard [34,49,50]\u2014can be inaccurate for large parameter values, and such inaccurate simulations can lead to misleading conclusions. We illustrate this latter point with an example from the literature in Sec. IV. Our work highlights the consequences of erroneous approaches to studying continuous-time contagion dynamics, which has important implications not only for the academic study of these dynamics [34\u201348] but also for the implementation of such dynamics within large-scale simulators for real contagions [31,32].",

This is a continuous-time Markov process where at any time t each node i in the network has a corresponding state Xti, which is either susceptible (Xti=S) or infected (Xti=I) [23,51,52]. The states of each node in the network change dynamically over time. Susceptible nodes become infected through each of their infected neighbours at a rate \u03b2 per infected neighbor, while infected nodes recover at a rate \u03bc. \u201cRate\u201d here refers to instantaneous transition rates, which in continuous-time dynamics define the transitions between states; these are defined in terms of probabilities as\n(1)\u03bc=lim\u0394t\u21920PXt+\u0394ti=S|Xti=I\u0394t,\n(2)\u03b2=lim\u0394t\u21920PXt+\u0394ti=Iviaj|Xti=S,Xtj=I\u0394t,where {Xt+\u0394ti=Iviaj} is the event that a susceptible node i became infected through an infected neighbor j. The fraction terms in the right hand sides of Eqs. (1) and (2) are the probabilities of state changes per unit time and taking the limit of these fractions as \u0394t\u21920 leads to the concept of transition rates. In general, we can define ri as the rate at which a node i changes from its current state to the opposite state; this is given by\n(3)ri=\u03b2mi,tifXti=S\u03bcifXti=I,where mi,t is the number of infected neighbors of node i at time t.",

While the master equation is the gold standard\u2014exactly describing the evolution of SIS dynamics\u2014the dimension of its sample space \u03a9 is 2N, which in general is prohibitively large for analytical or numerical studies. One way to tackle this problem is to study the dynamics as a series of individual transitions between states. In continuous-time dynamics nodes change state one at a time, or asynchronously [54]. Given the state of the network, the probability distributions governing both the length of time until the next state change and the node which will change state can be constructed.

These deviations arise through both the transition probabilities, which are used in place of transition rates, as well as the parallel (synchronous) state changes in discrete-time systems that are uncharacteristic of continuous-time dynamics. To understand the roots of the deviations introduced through the transition probabilities we can examine the definitions of \u03bc and \u03b2 as rates given in Eqs. (1) and (2). These equations can be rearranged to give transition probabilities in terms of these rates, i.e.,\n(5)PXt+\u0394ti=S|Xti=I=\u03bc\u0394t\n(6)PXt+\u0394ti=Iviaj|Xti=S,Xtj=I=\u03b2\u0394t,where in this case \u0394t is an infinitesimally small length of time. In the case that \u0394t is not infinitesimally small, Eqs. (5) and (6) become approximations. In a time interval of length \u0394t in the continuous-time Markov process, the exact probability that an infected node will recover is 1\u2212e\u2212\u03bc\u0394t while the probability that a susceptible node will become infected by a given infected neighbor is 1\u2212e\u2212\u03b2\u0394t. The transition probabilities \u03bc~ and \u03b2~, the right-hand side of Eqs. (5) and (6), are approximations to 1\u2212e\u2212\u03bc\u0394t and 1\u2212e\u2212\u03b2\u0394t, respectively, and an important question then arises of the effect these approximations have on the dynamics.",

We also plot the error \u03b5, which is defined as the difference between the discrete-time probability and the actual probability. When \u03bb~<0.1,\u03b5<0.01 and so the approximation is fairly accurate in this range. For larger values of the state transition probability \u03bb~, however, the approximation differs significantly from the true values. At \u03bb~=0.5,\u03b5\u22480.1 and when \u03bb~=1,\u03b5\u22480.37. These individual errors can accumulate and have significant implications on the dynamics as a whole; indeed we show empirically in Secs.

A commonly used simulations scheme is synchronous updating, also referred to as rejection sampling (Fig. 1) [34,49,57,59]. In this case, time advances in steps of one time unit, i.e., \u0394t=1. In a single time unit, a susceptible node will become infected by its infected neighbors with probability \u03b2~ per infected neighbor while infected nodes become susceptible with probability \u03bc~. Synchronous updating simulations are statistically exact realizations of the discrete-time dynamics; these dynamics are fully described by the discrete-time master equation\n(7)p(y,t+1)=\u2211y\u2032p(y\u2032,t)qy\u2032\u2192y,where qy\u2032\u2192y is the probability that the network changes from state y\u2032 to state y in a time step of length \u0394t=1 and is fully determined by the network structure and the transition probabilities \u03bc~ and \u03b2~ [24].

We begin in the next section by examining the discrete-time approximations of Eqs. (5) and (6) for fixed \u03bc and \u03b2 and various values of \u0394t. We show that discrete-time dynamics can accurately reproduce continuous-time dynamics for small values of \u0394t, but that they incur a breakdown in accuracy as \u0394t increases. Further to this, we show in Sec. IV that when the time step is fixed to the value \u0394t=1, as in much of the literature, discrete-time approaches break down in accuracy when the transition rates (\u03bc and \u03b2) are too large. This limits the range of parameters that can be studied with discrete-time approaches. We illustrate this with an example from the literature, also showing how synchronous updating simulation schemes can favour discrete-time formalisms leading to biased conclusions when comparing against continuous-time theories. Finally, in Sec. V we show that overly large values of \u03b2~ and \u03bc~ can affect the value of the epidemic threshold, even if the effective transition rate defined as \u03b3=\u03b2/\u03bc=\u03b2~/\u03bc~ is small.",

From this histogram, it is clear that while the discrete-time simulations are quite accurate for small \u0394t this accuracy can fully break down when \u0394t is too large. The accuracy of the probability distribution in the metastable state depends highly on the value of the time step used to reach the metastable state.

On the other hand, continuous-time systems are characterized by transition rates and differential equations of the form given by the master equation (4). Although the discrete-time formulation coincides with the continuous-time one in the limit \u0394t\u21920, the dynamics will differ for noninfinitesimal \u0394t. Issues then arise when comparing discrete and continuous-time systems and the choice of numerical scheme becomes important. We illustrate this now with an example from the literature, while also showing how the accuracy of discrete-time approaches with \u0394t=1 can be insufficient for large values of the transition rates.",

[36], Chakrabarti et al. introduced the nonlinear dynamical systems (NLDS) theory, a discrete-time approach to SIS modeling with a set of mean-field difference equations of the form\n(11)pi,t+1=f{pj,t}j=1N,for 0\u2264i\u2264N, where pi,t+1 is the probability that node i is infected at time t. They compare their results to two continuous-time formulations, the heterogeneous mean-field (HMF) approach of Pastor-Sattoras and Vespignani [49] and the Kephart-White (KW) [67] approach. The bases of the comparison are synchronous updating numerical simulations with a time step \u0394t=1 and it is found (see for example Fig. 4 of Ref. [36]) that the NLDS theory is much closer to the numerical simulations than both the HMF and KW theories.\n",

Again, the computer code used to perform the simulations is available from Ref. [60]. Included in Fig. 4 are synchronous updating simulations with a time step \u0394t=1, as in Ref. [36], along with synchronous updating simulations with a small time step \u0394t=0.01 and Gillespie algorithm simulations. In Fig. 4(c) of Ref. [36], where \u03bc=0.72 and \u03b2=0.2, it can be seen that the fraction \u03b7\u00af of infected nodes in the metastable state given by the NLDS theory matches very closely the synchronous updating numerical simulations. However, as can be seen in Fig. 4(b) here, these synchronous updating simulations differ quite significantly from continuous-time simulations, which plateau at the metastable state with \u03b7\u00af\u22480.04. The KW theory, which in Ref. [36] is rejected as being inaccurate, actually converges to a value much closer to the continuous-time simulations than the NLDS theory. Thus, using the correct simulation technique, the conclusions in Ref. [36] should be reversed: the KW model is more accurate than the NDLS model.",

Depending on the structure of the network and whether the network is finite or infinite, the critical point, or epidemic threshold, \u03b3c between different phases can vary. As mentioned in Sec. IV, there are still remaining questions about the steady-state behavior of the SIS model\u2014particularly the value of the epidemic threshold on such networks\u2014and so a good understanding of how different approximations affect the value of the epidemic threshold is important. In this section, we show that although the epidemic threshold is defined in terms of the ratio \u03b3=\u03b2/\u03bc=\u03b2~/\u03bc~, the individual values of the transition probabilities \u03b2~ and \u03bc~ used in discrete-time approaches affect the value of the epidemic threshold when it is calculated by (i) performing discrete-time numerical simulations or (ii) iterating a discrete-time system [such as Eq.

From Fig. 5 we see that when \u03bc~ is small (\u03bc~=0.1), the epidemic threshold predicted by synchronous updating simulations corresponds to this value \u03b3c=0.25. However, as \u03bc~ (and thus \u03b2~) increases, the accuracy of the discrete-time approach breaks down and both the fraction of infected nodes in the metastable state and the epidemic threshold deviate from the true values. The epidemic threshold decreases from \u03b3c=0.25 when \u03bc~=0.1 to \u03b3c=0.2 when \u03bc~=1, even though the ratio \u03b3=\u03b2~/\u03bc~ remains in the same range.

The light green and dark red circles are nodes in the network, which are in the susceptible and infected states, respectively. A square around a node means that the node has been chosen for updating at a certain moment and may change its state. In the Gillespie algorithm a node is chosen according to Lemma 2 and will always change its state while in the synchronous updating scheme every node has the chance to change state and will do so with a probability that depends on their state and the states of their nearest neighbors.",
