            "text": "Human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (hG-CSF) is a hematopoietic growth factor that plays an important role in hematopoietic cell proliferation, differentiation of hemopoietic precursor cells, and activation of mature neutrophilic granulocytes (Metcalf, 1985; Nomura et al., 1986). In addition, hG-CSF has been widely used for treating neutropenia caused by cancer chemotherapy. The mature hG-CSF is an 18.7-kDa glycoprotein that predominantly consists of 174 amino acids with two intramolecular disulfide bonds, although another minor form comprised of 177 amino acids as a result of alternative splicing of mRNA has also been described (Nagata et al., 1986; Lu et al., 1992; Hill et al., 1993). Furthermore, native hG-CSF has only one single O-glycosylation site at Thr133, which is not essential for biological activity (Kubota et al., 1990). Therefore, nonglycosylated recombinant hG-CSF has the same specific biological activity as natural glycosylated hG-CSF (Souza et al., 1986; Oh-eda et al., 1990). Because hG-CSF is synthesized in Escherichia coli as inclusion bodies, solubilization and renaturation steps are necessary to obtain the native conformation (Misawa & Kumagai, 1999), which means that highly complicated downstream processes with low-recovery yield are required.",

Despite these advantages, overproduced heterologous proteins in E. coli often form nonproductive inclusion bodies, and fusion expression using solubility enhancer proteins as fusion partner has emerged as an efficient production strategy to overcome the inclusion body formation (Baneyx & Mujacic, 2004; S\u00f8rensen & Mortensen, 2005). Currently, Shistosoma japonicum glutathione S-transferase (Smith & Johnson, 1988), E. coli maltose-binding protein (Bach et al., 2001), E. coli N utilization substance A (De Marco et al., 2004) and E. coli thioredoxin (LaVallie et al., 1993) are the most extensively examined fusion partners (Davis et al., 1999; Nallamsetty & Waugh, 2006), but they are not free from proprietary protection upon commercial application. Moreover, the traditional solubility-enhancing fusion partner proteins are not equally effective in promoting the folding of fusion partners (Dyson et al., 2004; Park et al., 2008). In this study, we report a novel and efficient strategy for the synthesis of soluble and correctly folded hG-CSF using various E. coli stress-responsive proteins that we previously found through a proteome-wide analysis of E. coli proteins under 2-hydroxyethyl disulfide (2-HEDS)-induced stress condition (Han et al., 2008). Using the six stress-responsive proteins of E. coli, we successfully produced hG-CSF with correct conformation as well as demonstrated using circular dichroism (CD).",

            "text": "The stress induced by overexpression of recombinant proteins resembles environmental stress conditions such as heat shock or amino acid starvation (S\u00f8rensen & Mortensen, 2005). Similarly, when proteins are exposed to oxidative stressors such as oxygen radicals and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), E. coli decreases the protein synthesis rate and enhances the protein degradation pathway (Koo et al., 2004). Previously, VanBogelen et al. (1987) reported that the expression level of molecular chaperones such as DnaK and GroES increased in the presence of H2O2-derived oxidative stress. It has also been reported that addition of 2-HEDS, a thiol-specific oxidant, dramatically reduced the NADPH/NADP+ ratio consistently in response to severe oxidative stress (Halleck et al., 1997; Ayene et al., 2002). In our recent report (Han et al., 2008), we investigated the E. coli proteome under 2-HEDS-induced stress conditions and found stress-responsive proteins that are significantly upregulated by the stressor through the comparative and quantitative analysis of E. coli proteomes under nonstress and stress conditions. Because many proteins were aggregated by 2-HEDS-induced stress, it seems reasonable to assume that such stress-responsive proteins have an intrinsically higher folding efficiency than other proteins that are aggregated in response to the same stress conditions. Among the stress-responsive proteins that we previously found (Han et al., 2008), we were interested in the six stress-responsive proteins [peptidyl-prolyl cis\u2013trans isomerase B (PpiB, 18 kDa), bacterioferritin (Bfr, 19 kDa), putative HTH-type transcriptional regulator yjdC (YjdC, 22 kDa), dihydrofolate reductase (FolA, 18 kDa), chemotaxis protein cheZ (CheZ, 24 kDa), and glutathione synthetase (GshB, 36 kDa)] that have relatively lower molecular mass compared with the other stress-responsive proteins. We found that these relatively small stress-responsive proteins were highly effective in enhancing the solubility of recombinant hG-CSF when used as fusion partner, which will be discussed next.",

            "text": "The six stress-responsive proteins (PpiB, Bfr, YjdC, FolA, CheZ, and GshB) were used as N-terminus fusion expression partner to synthesize the hybrid proteins, i.e. NH2-[fusion partner]\u2237[D4K]\u2237[hG-CSF]-COOH in E. coli cytoplasm. Proteins with high molecular mass are usually not used as fusion partner because the big fusion partners may reduce the actual amount of target protein that is obtained after the fusion partner is removed. PpiB (18 kDa), Bfr (19 kDa), YjdC (22 kDa), FolA (18 kDa), CheZ (24 kDa), and GshB (36 kDa) are relatively small proteins compared with the other proteins above and were also the most effective in enhancing the solubility of hG-CSF. As shown in Fig. 3a and b, the N-terminus fusion of six stress-responsive proteins led to a significant increase in both the expression level and solubility of hG-CSF. Inclusion body formation presumably occurs due to protein overexpression in a heterologous environment in which nascent polypeptide chains are continuously synthesized and then aggregate because of nonspecific hydrophobic interactions among the partially folded intermediates of the recombinant proteins, various host proteins, or a combination of the two within the cytoplasm. In many cases, broad exposure of hydrophobic surfaces on newly synthesized polypeptides results in intermolecular aggregation and misfolding. To prevent such occurrences, molecular chaperones (DnaK/DnaJ/GrpE system, GroEL/GroES, etc.) that recognize and interact with hydrophobic patches of nascent proteins can be used (Maier et al., 2005). Hydrophobic amino acids are usually buried within the core of folded proteins but become exposed in the partially folded polypeptide intermediates (R\u00fcdiger et al., 1997; Suh et al., 1999). Because of this, the solubility-enhancing function of stress-responsive proteins may be similar to that of cis-acting molecular chaperones in the context of fusion proteins (Kapust & Waugh, 1999) or as a \u2018chaperone magnet\u2019 (Fox et al., 2001; Ahn et al., 2005) that effectively recruits chaperone binding and prohibits undesired and nonspecific protein\u2013protein interactions.",

In order to purify the fusion partner-free hG-CSF in E. coli, we already inserted the hybrid gene encoding NH2-[fusion tag]\u2237[D4K]\u2237[hG-CSF]-COOH into the NdeI\u2013HindIII site of the pET28a(+) plasmid vector. Most of the expressed fusion protein, i.e. NH2-[(His)6]\u2237[fusion tag]\u2237[D4K]\u2237[hG-CSF]-COOH was present in the soluble fraction of the cell lysates, and then the soluble fraction was subjected to metal affinity purification using an Ni2+\u2013NTA column (W\u00fclfing et al., 1994). After loading the soluble fraction containing the fusion proteins onto the Ni2+-NTA column, we subsequently added enterokinase to the column to remove the fusion tags. Because the sequence D4K for enterokinase cleavage is downstream of the fusion tag, the cleaved fusion tags as well as any uncleaved fusion proteins still have the (His)6 tag and hence remains bound to the Ni2+\u2013NTA column, while the released hG-CSF is found in the flow-through from the Ni2+\u2013NTA column. The flow-through containing the released hG-CSF was centrifuged, and the insoluble pellet and supernatant were then analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot (Fig. 4). Figure 4 clearly indicates that the recombinant hG-CSF released from the fusion protein was still present in the form of soluble protein.",

Recent studies also verified the proper folding of recombinant hG-CSF using CD spectra (Bae et al., 1998, 1999; Jeong & Lee, 2001). In the other recent studies using CD spectrum, properly folded conformations of recombinant human and viral proteins were structurally analyzed (Leopoldino et al., 2006; Brucz et al., 2007; Tolun et al., 2007; Vamvakas et al., 2007). The CD spectra of the purified fusion-free hG-CSF (Fig. 5a) were identical to the spectrum of commercial hG-CSF standard (Fig. 5b), thereby indicating that the recombinant hG-CSF has a conformation with the correct secondary structure. It is also assumed that the recombinant hG-CSF possesses biological activities similar to native hG-CSF based on the proper conformation of recombinant hG-CSF, even though the biological activity was not directly determined (Bae et al., 1998, 1999; Jeong & Lee, 2001).",

In addition, even after the fusion partner was removed by enzymatic cleavage, the released, i.e. fusion-free recombinant hG-CSF was present in the form of soluble protein. The CD spectra of the affinity-purified hG-CSF was investigated, and the results showed that the recombinant hG-CSF had a conformation with the correct secondary structure. Consequently, the six stress-responsive E. coli proteins were highly effective cis-acting solubility and folding enhancers for the production of hG-CSF and could be used for the bacterial synthesis of other aggregation-prone heterologous proteins in the form of soluble and active proteins.",
