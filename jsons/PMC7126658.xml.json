Real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay was used to confirm the diagnosis of A(H1N1) infection. Patients presenting with pneumonia with high clinical suspicion of A(H1N1) infection but negative RT-PCR test results for A(H1N1) were also included in this study. Children younger than 14 years of age were excluded. Most patients were hospitalized for treatment, whereas those who presented with less serious illness and did not need oxygen supplementation were treated as outpatients under home quarantine.",

In contrast, nosocomial infection was common in the patients (12/50 [24.0%]), and gram-negative bacilli were the predominant causative pathogens. Aspergillus spp was also seen. Progressive A(H1N1) infection, intubation, a prolonged hospital stay, IV antibiotic use, and use of oral or IV corticosteroids may be risk factors for nosocomial infection caused by gram-negative bacilli and Aspergillus spp.",
