People, especially in leadership positions, are being asked to make many decisions in a compressed time frame. What better time to use the collective mind to inform how we operate? Many of you have been thinking, or are beginning to think, about how to restart your laboratory activities. Engage all members of the group in devising a means to operate that is safe while still allowing projects to resume. Reach out to your colleagues, locally and at other institutions, for ideas.",

To paraphrase Tony Fauci, the virus will decide when we can move back to the way we are used to. Let us not rush the process of returning to normal. There are lessons to be learned from the 1918 influenza pandemic, during which communities that were cautious in returning to normal suffered less in the long run, in terms of both physical and economic health.",
