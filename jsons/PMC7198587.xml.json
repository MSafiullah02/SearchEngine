The CDC has named theirs \u201cClara\u201d (Fig. 1). Chatbots are software programs that talk with people through voice or text in their natural language3,4. Some well-known examples include \u201cAlexa\u201d from Amazon, \u201cSiri\u201d from Apple, and \u201cCortana\u201d from Microsoft. They often come pre-installed on smartphones or home-based smart speakers5. In recent years, chatbot use for health-related purposes has increased considerably, from supporting clinicians with clinical interviews and diagnosis to aiding consumers in self-managing chronic conditions6. While promising, the use of chatbots may pose safety risks. Chatbots have varied widely in their responses to questions about physical health, suicide, intimate partner violence, substance abuse, and other sensitive conversations4,6\u20139. In one study, about a third (29%) of chatbot responses to health questions could have caused harm, and about half of those (16%) could have resulted in death if acted upon9. The COVID-19 pandemic puts in stark relief the potential for chatbots to help save lives.",

Globally and locally, control and prevention measures have been frustrated by myriad challenges. First, accurate information is crucial, but often unknown, or obscured by misinformation11. Second, disease fear and confusion contribute to under-reporting of symptoms12. Third, preventative strategies such as hand washing or social distancing are costly to disseminate and enforce. Fourth, infection countermeasures (e.g., social distancing and quarantine) are psychologically damaging13. For example, the SARS outbreak in 2003 resulted in a \u201cmental health catastrophe,\u201d in which 59% of patients in a hospitalized cohort developed a diagnosable psychiatric disorder, most commonly post-traumatic stress disorder and depression. After 30 months, less than half of this cohort psychologically recovered14. In this light, the WHO has called for \u201clarge-scale implementation of high-quality, non-pharmaceutical public health measures (p. 20)\u201d to help limit new cases, and safely triage those who may be infected15. Normally, resources such as clinician attention or emergency department waiting areas are used at a rate the healthcare system can handle. In a pandemic, the cost of these resources being spent inefficiently or contaminated can be catastrophic.",

Doing too much (e.g., going to the emergency room for mild symptoms) can overburden the healthcare system, wasting precious resources. Thus, reliable information sources are crucial to prevent a \u201cmisinfodemic\u201d: the spread of a disease facilitated by viral misinformation16. For instance, during the Zika outbreak in 2016, misleading posts spread faster and were more popular than accurate posts on the large social-media site, Facebook17. Because chatbots provide a single answer to most questions, they are able to present concise information from credible sources, which may be less overwhelming than social media or web search engines\u2019 long list of results. This matters because false news spreads online both faster and further than accurate news18. Chatbots, in contrast to newspapers and online information sources, can often hear and respond in natural language, improving access for people who cannot read or have difficulty using the internet. They can be available any time of the day to answer questions with up-to-date information, and unlike human experts, can concurrently speak with millions of people at the same time in local languages and dialects.",

Individuals want to avoid getting sick, and institutions such as hospitals or local governments need data-informed policies to increase capacity (i.e., ordering more testing kits) and to plan social interventions (e.g., closing businesses). However, efforts to quickly and accurately gather population level infection rates are stymied by individuals\u2019 fear that disclosing symptoms may harm their professional and social lives12. Chatbots may be uniquely well suited for symptom screening in a pandemic because people with stigmatized conditions often avoid seeking health care and education19. Prior research suggests people are more willing to disclose sensitive personal symptom information to a chatbot than to a human3. This means that people may be more forthcoming with chatbots than other humans, providing timelier and more accurate personal triage and population-level infection rate estimates. Healthcare organizations, large corporations like Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Microsoft, and Tencent, governmental agencies like the CDC, and non-governmental organizations like the WHO have launched or helped develop COVID-19 focused chatbots on platforms available to billions of users, likely with the aim of increasing accessibility1,20,21.",

Chatbots could fill the gap between knowledge and action through repetition, step-by-step instructions, and by suggesting \u201ctips and tricks\u201d for behavior change (e.g., self-enactable behavior change techniques)22. In a study of low health literacy patients in a hospital setting, 60% requested additional health information from a chatbot at discharge23. In a pandemic, chatbots could offload time-consuming but important behavioral support and instruction from human healthcare workers. Home-based chatbots, like the ones on devices from Amazon, Apple, and Google, may support behavior change by linking users to third-party voice apps through \u201cskills\u201d or \u201cactions.\u201d These additional capabilities allow chatbots to provide services and share information beyond their native programming.",

Simply disclosing concerns and receiving emotionally supportive responses can have positive value in some contexts25.

Providing reliable evidence-based information is critical in a pandemic and two issues have material impact: conflicting advice between global and local authorities, and misinformation18. Chatbot developers must decide whose voice to amplify and should provide reliable information from global sources like the WHO, while also coordinating with regional authorities. Both a feature and a challenge of chatbots is their ability to link users to third-party services (e.g., \u201cskills\u201d) that then gather and share data with unknown or unexpected consequences. If deployed for symptom screening, which is currently happening for COVID-19, constitutional and regulatory boundaries are tested by sharing health-related information between companies and governments27,28. This concern is not theoretical, as both the United States and Israel have reportedly explored using digital contact tracing to understand infection vectors29,30. Finally, although chatbots have demonstrated feasibility in behavior change and mental health treatment, they are untested in pandemics and have demonstrated limits in health crisis detection and response4,6\u20139.",
