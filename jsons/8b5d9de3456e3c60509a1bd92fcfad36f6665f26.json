Recent epidemiological studies have developed the concept of beneficial non specific effect of live vaccines. This means that it may have effects on infections not targeted by the vaccine. 1 Observationl studies found that Bacillus Calmette Guerin (BCG) vaccination is associated with reduced non specific mortality and better survival 1 . Other immunological studies demonstrated that BCG can induce trained innate immuniy. Otherwise, urologists know well that BCG is an attenuated mycobacterium developed as a vaccine for tuberculosis that has demonstrated antitumor activity in several different cancers including bladder cancer. 2 These concordant elements, in favor of the non specific immunotherapeutic mechanism of the BCG vaccine, led us to make the assumption that the COVID-19 mortality can be partially explained by the vaccination policies of countries around the world.",

The situation in Italy is quite edifying with high morbidity and mortality, while it seems under control in other countries with a similar economic and health systems. 5 Furthermore, containment measures have been taken all over the world every few days. We think that what differentiates a group of individuals from another is the immune system's response to this pathogen. Hence the importance of vaccination to deal with infections.

However, numerous immunological studies have concluded that a vaccine can have a non specific protective effect. 1 At the beginning of the 20 th century, Calmette already noted that children vaccinated with BCG had a lower mortality rate 1 . Since then may have been born the principle of non specific effects of BCG vaccine. BCG was used in the 1970s in clinical studies as a non specific immunotherapy for multiple malignant neoplasms. While severeal reports have show its efficiency in the treatments of melanoma and leukaemia, others were controversial making BCG use limited in such settings. Nonethless, BCG has continued to be used for non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer since its first use in 1976. 6, 7 Indeed, we currently know the mechanism of action of intravesical instillations of BCG and it seems that it is attributed to a local immune response characterized by induced expression of cytokines in the urine and bladder wall and by an influx of granulocytes and mononuclear and dendritic cells. 8 Faced with this set of elements, we hypothesized that BCG vaccination could have a protective effect against SARS-CoV-2 infection.",
