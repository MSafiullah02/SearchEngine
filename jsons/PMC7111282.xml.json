Infection of this virus was first reported in December 2019, and origin of the virus was traced back to a large seafood/wide animal market in Wuhan city. The serious clinical symptoms of the viral infection, including fever, dry cough, dyspnea, and pneumonia, may result in progressive respiratory failure and even death. Moreover, the quick spread of the virus has caused an epidemic in China, as well as infection cases worldwide. The whole-genome sequence of Wuhan new virus (WH-Human_1) was first released on January 10, 2020 (Zhang, 2020), followed by additional ones released in Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data (GISAID) (Shu and McCauley, 2017). Later, this new virus was determined and announced as a new type of coronavirus (CoV; 2019-nCoV) by the World Health Organization (WHO, 2020a).",

CoVs primarily infect wild animals including mammals and birds. They also infect humans and cause various diseases such as upper and lower respiratory tract infections and respiratory syndromes. Among them, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) CoV and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome (MERS) CoV can cause serious respiratory syndrome in humans (Schoeman and Fielding, 2019). For instance, the outbreak of SARS in 2003 led to a pandemic with 8906 infected cases and 774 deaths reported worldwide (WHO, 2003). Meanwhile, the outbreak of MERS confirmed 2229 cases globally, including 791 associated deaths (WHO, 2018).",

Multiple binding and neutralization epitopes have been identified in the S proteins of CoVs (Hwang et al., 2006; Prabakaran et al., 2006; Reguera et al., 2012), which makes S protein an essential antigen for vaccine design.",

Cross-reactive epitopes (CREs) are shared or similar epitope regions on the antigen surface among viruses that can be bound or neutralized by the same antibodies.

S proteins of 2019-nCoV and SARS strains share high structural similarity with a root-mean-square deviation of 1.21 \u00c5 according to modeling structures. Individual epitope residues were derived from immune complexes of CoV S protein and further merged into 6 epitope regions (Table S2). Mapping the epitope regions to the 3D structure of S protein of 2019-nCoV demonstrated that five epitope regions are located in the RBD (Fig. S1).

The higher the score, the better the potential for cross-reaction between the paired antigens.",

Detailed results for the 6th epitope region shown in Fig. 1A and B displayed the detailed clustering of the 2019-nCoV group, as well as the similarity score between them. Antigenically, 2019-nCoV is most similar to SARS-CoV, followed by BCoV (Fig. 1B). Similarity scores higher than 0.80 were detected between 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV strains.

Interestingly, although no direct overlapping, the potential CRE residues are highly adjacent to essential ACE2-binding sites in the 3D structure (Zhou et al., 2020; Xu et al., 2020), suggesting that neutralization antibodies targeting CRE may also interfere or even block the interaction between the new CoV and ACE2 receptor because of steric hindrance (Fig. 1F). As such, the CRE region recommended here may likely become the cross-protective epitope between 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV.",

Epitopes are usually referred to as highly specific and continuous areas on the surface of an antigen which can be recognized and bound by corresponding antibodies. Previous analysis on antibody-antigen complexes found that more than 90% of epitope residues appeared conformational (Van Regenmortel, 1996). As conformational epitopes can be influenced by various factors such as mutation/insertion/deletion, structure change, or neighboring mutations, examining sequence conservation alone is usually not enough to evaluate the similarity of epitope regions among viruses.",

As Fig. S1 indicates, epitope region 3 is located in S1 domain, which is far from the important ACE2-binding site. For the rest 5 regions, although located in the RBD, some epitope residues become spatially scattered, rather than maintaining the epitope conformation, such as the case in region 1. Thus, region 6 was recommended here for CRE candidate because of its high score, surface continuity, and proximity to essential binding sites of ACE2. Possibility of an additional CRE may also exist in other regions of S protein or other antigens between 2019-nCoV and SARS-CoV. It is noted that these potential CREs are highly conformational. Following antibody design and screening is suggested to consider the whole domain as antibodies derived from linear epitopes might have difficulty in fully recognizing the CRE structures.",
