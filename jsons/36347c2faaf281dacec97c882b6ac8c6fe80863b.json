However, large-scale evaluation of the public's response to social distancing campaigns has been lacking. We used anonymized and aggregated mobility data from Google Location History users to estimate the impact of social distancing recommendations on bulk mobility among users who have opted into this service. We found that state-of-emergency declarations resulted in a ~10% reduction in time spent away from places of residence. Implementation of one or more social distancing policies resulted in an additional 25% reduction in mobility the following week. Subsequent shelter-in-place mandates provided an additional 29% reduction. Our findings provide evidence that state-wide mandates are effective in promoting social distancing within this study group.",

Social distancing is expected to reduce the frequency of close contact with others and thus minimize the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus. Prior experience with the 2009 H1N1 influenza and Ebola suggests that social distancing is effective in reducing disease transmission. (1, 2) In China, officials engaged in an unprecedented quarantine of Hubei province to contain COVID-19 transmission out of the initial epicenter city of Wuhan. (3) (4) (5) As the pandemic spread to new clusters of infection in the United States (U.S.) efforts at containment and then mitigation have been largely at the discretion of state and local governments, leading to a patchwork of directives to encourage social distancing. These policies have included state emergency declarations, work-from-home policies, school closures, closures of non-essential businesses and services, limits placed on large social gatherings, bans on in-restaurant service, and shelter-in-place orders. (6) To date, there is some limited data that these policies may be working. Several news outlets have shown substantial drops in mobility across the nation since early March, although the ties to specific policy interventions are less clear. Given the current reliance on social distancing policies to limit the spread of COVID-19, systematically quantifying the impact of these policies on mobility may be helpful to public health officials.",

The first state of emergency related to COVID-19 was declared by Washington State on February 29, and most recently by Oklahoma and Maine on March 15. Many states subsequently ordered that schools close (led by Louisiana and Virginia on March 13, 2020), and/or placed limits on specific activities and businesses in order to promote social distancing. Within a week, 48 states and Washington DC had implemented at least 1 social distancing policy. In 78% of states, the first social distancing order imposed was the closure of schools. On March 16, Nevada enacted orders advising residents to shelter in place, followed by California on March 19, 2020. As of April 5, 80% of states had ordered residents to shelter in place.",

            "text": "We used the same data that was used to prepare the Community Mobility Reports published by Google (8, 9) to compute aggregated visit trends to a number of specific categories of locations (see Supplemental Material). Trends were aggregated to the county level (including Washington, DC and independent cities that are not otherwise included in county boundaries), and available daily from January 1 through March 29, 2020. Within each county we applied a regression discontinuity analysis to estimate the relative change in the amount of time spent away from places of residence of Location History users and the relative change in the number of visits to specific categories of locations in the week after versus before each intervention. The following results should be interpreted in light of several important limitations including that our data are limited to Google users who have opted in to Location History. On average across the country, a declaration of a state of emergency was associated with a 9.9% (95% confidence interval [CI]: -10.1%, -9.7%) decrease in time spent away from places of residence, 11.4% (95% CI: -11.8%, -11.0%) fewer visits to the workplace, 11.5% (-11.7%, -11.2%) fewer visits to retail outlets and recreational sites, and 9.3% fewer visits to transit stops (-9.6%, -9.0%) in the following week ( Figure 2A ). These changes in mobility are noteworthy given that emergency declarations did not necessarily specifically call for increased social distancing and suggests that government messaging, news coverage, and/or actions observed in other countries could have influenced people's activities. Visits to parks were also affected by emergency declarations, with a small 3.5% (95% CI: -4.4%, -2.6%) average reduction. The smaller impact of emergency declarations on visits to parks versus other venues is likely at least partly explained by the warmer weather and transition to spring during this period. On the other hand, emergency declarations coincided with a relative increase in visits to grocery stores and pharmacies of 8.2% (95% CI: 7.9%, 8.5%), consistent with news reports of individuals stocking up on dry goods, cleaning supplies, and medications at the end of February and early March in anticipation of impending social distancing orders. (10) We next examined the impact on mobility of the first social distancing policies implemented in each state. We found that on average across the country these orders resulted in additional reductions in mobility above and beyond the changes observed following emergency declarations ( Figure 2B ). Specifically, implementation of one or more social distancing policies resulted in a further 24.5% (95% CI: -24.7%, -24.3%) reduction in time spent away from places of residence, a further 33.0% (-33.3%, -32.8%) reduction in visits to retail and recreational outlets, and a further 27.9% (-28.3%, -27.5%) reduction in visits to work in the following week. The same pattern was evident for visits to parks, and for visits to grocery stores and pharmacies. The impacts of social distancing orders varied substantially between states ( Figure 3 ). For example, implementation of social distancing policies was associated with a 36% decrease in the time spent away from places of residence in New Jersey versus a 12% decrease in Louisiana, but we note that differences in mobility between states may be due to a number of factors beyond social distancing policies. The median of state-specific changes in time spent away from places of residence was a decrease of 19%. States that enacted multiple social distancing measures tended to experience greater reductions in mobility. The impact of social distancing orders also varied substantially across counties within each state regardless of the average impact across the state ( Supplemental Table 1 ). Results were consistent when considering changes in visits to work, visits to grocery stores and pharmacies, visits to retail, recreation, and eateries, visits to parks, and visits to transit stops ( Supplemental Figure 1 ).",

First, our source data are limited to smartphone users who have opted in to Google's consumer Location History feature. These data may not be representative of the population as whole, and furthermore their representativeness may vary by location. Additionally, these limited data are only viewed through the lens of differential privacy algorithms, specifically designed to protect user anonymity and obscure fine detail (8) . Moreover, comparisons across rather than within locations are only descriptive since these regions can differ in substantial ways besides the policy environment. Second, our analyses are focused on state-level policies, whereas individual metropolitan areas and counties within a state may have implemented specific social distancing policies prior to implementation of state-level policies (see Supplemental Figure 4 for detailed examples from King County, WA, Westchester County, NY, New York County, NY, and Santa Clara County, CA). Third, we did not assess the impact of social distancing policies or resulting changes in mobility on published counts of confirmed COVID-19 cases or deaths. Although such analyses are of critical importance, they are complicated by the heterogeneous availability of testing, delays in reporting, and the inherent latency before social distancing impacts are evident in clinical outcomes, and thus beyond the scope of this report.",

While the majority of states declared states of emergency by early March, the emergency declaration per se had only a modest effect on mobility.

Documents were linked from the Kaiser Family Foundation's State Data and Policy Actions Tracker (11) and supplemented with manual searches of state public health websites. Dates of policy enactment were cross-checked with the AEI COVID-19 Action Tracker (12) and the NYTimes Shelter in Place Tracker (13) . Policies tracked were categorized as follows: 1) state-declared state of emergency, 2) state-mandated school closures, 3) state-mandated closing of non-essential businesses and services, 4) state-mandated limits on large gatherings, 5) state-imposed bans on in-restaurant service, and 6) state-imposed mandatory quarantines. State-mandated closing of non-essential businesses included any order closing gyms, theaters, and other businesses even if it did not extend to all non-essential businesses. Limits on large gatherings referred to any ban on gatherings larger than a certain number of people, though that threshold varied between states. For states that issued additional orders reducing the size of permitted gatherings, the date of the first such order was taken. Bans on in-restaurant service excluded mandatory reductions in restaurant capacity and included only those orders that prohibited any restaurant activity except pick-up and delivery. These bans often also included bars and clubs. Mandatory quarantine referred to any stay-at-home or shelter-in-place order that prohibited non-essential travel away from the home for all residents. Shelter-in-place orders specifically for high-risk individuals were excluded. Orders that went into effect at any time after 12:00 pm were considered to begin on the following day.",

During this time there were only 5 reported cases of COVID-19 in the U.S., which were isolated in Washington state. Although there was a small drop in time spent away from the place of residence across these pre-intervention periods, the much larger effects on mobility observed after each of the policies suggests that our observed effect during the exposure period is in fact related to the implementation of social distancing ( Supplement Figure 2 ). Figures 2 and 3 in the main text to gain a sense of how different these effects look when the first social-distancing measures were implemented. Under the null hypothesis of no policy-affect, the median observed change is slightly below -2%. However, during the first social-distancing measures, the median drop is nearly 10 times as large at -19%. For further context, all but two counties during the first social-distancing measures are below the null distribution median, and over 96% of counties are below the null distribution 2.5% percentile. A comparison between the changes in mobility during first social-distancing measures and changes in mobility under the null hypothesis for each metric is presented in Supplemental Tables 2.A and 2.B .",

However, it is also of interest to quantify the overall effect of social distancing by comparing mobility at the end versus the start of March. We define the overall effect as the change in mobility from the week before the term \"social distancing\" started increasing in Google Search (March 1-7th) to the last week available in the data (March 23-29th). We see a significant decrease in all metrics. The ordering of the magnitudes is comparable to those in Figure 2B . As expected the overall magnitudes of the drops are larger than any of the incremental effects in Figure  2 . Table 1 : ANOVA sum of squares decomposition of the variation in the relative change on average time spent away from places of residence across counties for the linear model with the relative pre-post difference in time spent away from the residence as the outcome and state as the only independent variable. The results show that approximately half of the variance in the outcome is explained by differences between states and the remaining variance is largely explained by differences across counties within states. Figure 2 .A Relative changes in national averages from January 27-February 2, 2020 to February 5-11, 2020 for all metrics of interest. The results are also shown in Supplemental Table 2 .A.

Since these periods occurred before any orders were issued, we interpret these changes as observations under the null hypothesis of no policy effect. Although most metrics show a statistically significant decrease, the magnitude of the effect is considerably smaller compared with the policy intervention effects. The effect of the first social distancing order on time spent away from places of residence is ~12x larger. Similar differences are observed for the other metrics, ranging from ~2x to ~90x for Parks and Transit, respectively. The same reference null distribution can be used for the effects of the other two waves (i.e., emergency declaration and shelter in place).SupplementalTable 2.B : Distribution of relative changes across counties for metrics from January 27-February 2, 2020 to February 5-11, 2020 compared to the analogous distributions during the first social distancing measures. This table depicts the heterogeneity of the changes before any orders were issued and are interpreted as observations under the null hypothesis of no policy effect. In this table, we see that all the medians for the first social distancing measure are substantially lower than the medians under the null. Furthermore, the spread of the effects for the first social distancing measure is larger (e.g., for workplace visits the 90% range is 26 percentual points during the treatment period vs 10 percentual points under the null). The same reference null distribution can be used for the effects of the other two waves of policy interventions.",
