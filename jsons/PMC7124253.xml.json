These changes in trade regulations seem to have expanded the global market.

In 1971, the Agriculture Research Service became the Animal and Plant Health Service (APHS), and in 1972 the meat and poultry inspection divisions of the Consumer and Marketing Service were added, changing APHS to APHIS.

Some were personal pets; others were purebred dogs that had been purchased from an overseas breeder. Few dogs were imported for resale. In 2003, the number of imports of multiple puppies per shipment began to increase. The number of puppies imported into California through airports has increased from 110 multidog imports documented in 2003 to 365 in 2004 and 341 in 2005. Each shipment contained as many as 40 puppies. Such large numbers of puppies are being imported for resale and not as personal pets. A similar increase was seen nationally.23 An estimated 287,000 dogs were imported into the United States in 2006, with 70,600 lacking proof of valid rabies vaccinations, mostly because they were too young to be vaccinated.23 In California, most of the imported puppies were destined for Los Angeles County (Fig. 2\n), and the most common countries of origin were Mexico and Canada (Fig. 3\n). Many dogs also were imported from Asia, Europe, South America, and Russia. In Los Angeles County, many puppies were imported from South Korea by pet stores or kennels. The most common breed imported was Yorkshire terrier, followed by Maltese, bulldogs, and poodles (Fig. 4\n).",

Puppies were sold before VPH-RCP visits, incorrect addresses were indicated on the CDC confinement agreement form, and individuals refused entrance onto their properties. In addition, some importers provided falsified rabies certificates, and puppies were not available for inspection. This problem was not limited to Los Angeles County. New York City sent out a veterinary alert in 2005 to notify veterinarians that puppies were being imported from rabies-endemic countries and that some were being sold without completing the mandated confinement.24 The CDC noted more than 4000 confinement agreement violations among imported dogs in 2006.23\n",

In 1988, a 5-month-old puppy imported from Mexico into New Hampshire became ill 3 weeks after its arrival.30 The dog began whimpering and had tremors in one leg for 3 days. It then developed urinary and fecal incontinence and finally excessive salivation. The owners took the puppy to a veterinarian, who suspected rabies based on the puppy's history and clinical signs. The puppy was euthanized, tested, and found to be rabid. Seventeen people had been exposed, including the owner's classmates, partygoers, and a babysitter. In 2004, a 3-month-old ill puppy was imported from Thailand through the Los Angeles International Airport and was allowed to enter the country.31 It had been evaluated by several veterinarians in Thailand for a respiratory illness and had begun vomiting while in flight. The owner took the puppy to three veterinary clinics as she traveled to her home in Northern California. The puppy was aggressive and seemed to have pain along its back. Obvious neurologic signs did not develop until it was seen at the third veterinary clinic. At that point, the puppy was euthanized and tested positive for rabies (Thai canine variant). Numerous people had been exposed, and 12 individuals required postexposure prophylaxis.27 More recently, in 2007, a puppy imported from India by a Washington State veterinarian developed rabies after being adopted by another veterinarian and taken to Alaska.27 The puppy became ill 2 days after arrival from India, with at least one episode of regurgitation. It then bit one of the veterinarians and another dog. Clinic staff noticed it gnawing on its kennel, resulting in bleeding gums. Even so, another veterinarian completed a health certificate for the puppy, and a third veterinarian transported it to Alaska. The day after arriving in Alaska, the puppy developed neurologic signs and died. The puppy was tested and found to be rabid (Indian canine rabies variant); eight individuals received rabies postexposure prophylaxis.",

In September 2007, a 16-year-old dog was imported from Trinidad and entered the country through the Miami airport.41 It was seen by a Mississippi veterinarian 3 days after arrival for ocular damage caused by larval infection. In both cases, the practitioners recognized that the larvae seemed unusual and submitted specimens for identification.

Following the introduction of the new rabbits, nearly half of his herd died, and the remaining animals were euthanized to contain the outbreak. The source of the infection never was determined.",

Regulations are in place to reduce the risk of diseases that pose a threat to public health and agriculture from imported animals. Changes to the regulations are being proposed to define better the United States entry and follow-up requirements. Veterinarians play an essential role in preventing the transmission of zoonotic disease between animals and the public and are on the front line dealing with imported animals. They should be aware of and compliant with state and local regulations and play an active role in educating and advising clients regarding the risk of importing an animal. Veterinarians should be vigilant when examining new puppies. Many imported dogs never are confined properly or inspected for infectious diseases, and many diseases may not be detected readily in imported dogs. With the current rabies vaccination requirements in the United States, most veterinarians have never seen a pet with rabies and do not consider rabies in the differential diagnosis. Additionally, early signs of rabies may be very subtle and may not be recognized readily. It is important to keep rabies on the differential list, especially if the pet is known to have been or is suspected of having been imported. Additional training in recognizing emerging infectious diseases may be helpful. Veterinarians should contact their local health department immediately about any potential rabies cases or suspicious illness, especially in imported animals.
