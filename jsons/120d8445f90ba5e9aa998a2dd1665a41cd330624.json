As no effective antiviral treatment is currently available, new drugs are urgently needed. We employed transcriptional analysis to uncover potential antiviral drugs from natural products or FDA approved drugs. We found liquiritin significantly inhibit replication of SARS-CoV-2 in Vero E6 cells with EC50 = 2.39 \u00b5M. Mechanistically, we found liquiritin exerts anti-viral function by mimicking type I interferon. Upregulated genes induced by liquiritin are enriched in GO categories including type I interferon signaling pathway, negative regulation of viral genome replication and etc. In toxicity experiment, no death was observed when treated at dose of 300 mg/kg for a week in ICR mice. All the organ indexes but liver and serum biochemical indexes were normal after treatment. Liquiritin is abundant in licorice tablet (~0.2% by mass), a traditional Chinese medicine. Together, we recommend liquiritin as a competitive candidate for treating COVID-19. We also expect liquiritin to have a broad and potent antiviral function to other viral pathogens, like HBV, HIV and etc.",

Previously, the chemical treated cell cultures were measured and analyzed by microarray or L1000 techniques 3, 4 . The gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) or Venn diagram were applied to connect the gene expression profile to up / down gene sets of certain diseases. Such technique, named connectivity map (CMAP) has been applied in screening drugs for obesity 5, 6 .

The induced ISGs include MX1, OAS, IFIT, IFITM and etc. as shown in the \"negative regulation of viral genome replication\" category. IFIT1 and IFIT3 belong to the type I interferon (IFN)-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats (IFIT) family and IFITM1 belongs to the IFN-induced transmembrane protein (IFITM) family. Thus, liquiritin exhibits a general anti-viral activity by mimicking the type I IFN. Further, the enrichment analysis of protein-protein interaction networks reveals a significant module composed of nine ISGs (Figure 2d ). Other genes in this module indicate potential regulators of these ISGs.",

To elucidate potential biological process associated with the DEGs, we performed GO enrichment analysis utilizing the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (DAVID). p-value < 0.05 was defined as the cut-off criteria. The upregulated DEGs were mapped to STRING to evaluate the PPI information and set confidence score > 0.4 as the cut-off standard. Cytoscape was used to visualize the PPI network, a practical open-source software tool for the visual exploration of biomolecule interaction networks consisting of protein, gene and other types of interaction.",

Stock solutions of the inhibitor were prepared with 100% DMSO. The 100 \u00b5l reaction systems in assay buffer contain 0.5 \u00b5M protease and 5% DMSO or inhibitor to the final concentration. First, dilute SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro with assay buffer to the desired concentration. 5 \u00b5l DMSO or inhibitor at various concentrations was pre-incubated with 85 \u00b5l diluted SARS-CoV-2 3CLpro for 30 min at room temperature. And then add 10 \u00b5l 2 mM substrate Thr-Ser-Ala-Val-Leu-Gln-pNA (dissolved in water) into above system to final concentration of 200 \u00b5M to initiate the reaction. Increase in absorbance at 390 nm was recorded for 20 min at interval of 30 s with a kinetics mode program using a plate reader (Synergy, Biotek). The percent of inhibition was calculated by Vi/V0, where V0 and Vi represent the mean reaction rate of the enzyme incubated with DMSO or compounds. IC50 was fitted with Hill function. ",
