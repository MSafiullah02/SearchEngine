Migrant workers (also called the floating population) emerged in China in the early 1980s when rural residents were allowed to seek employment in urban areas. Since then the number of migrant workers in China has been increasing dramatically. A report from the National Bureau of Statistics of China shows that there were a total of 145.33 million migrant workers in 2009, while the number in 1989 was only about 30 million. Migrant workers make a huge contribution to China's development, but they also bring many societal problems.",

At a young age, lacking education and professional skills, most temporary migrant workers have to work in construction sites, restaurants, or crowded factories that require no or little experience. Temporary employment and China's current existing household registration system make it very difficult for migrant workers to settle down permanently in urban cities. Thus they usually cannot access the social welfare benefits and health care available to urban residents (Zhang, 2001). Unstable living and working conditions, being away from sexual partners, economic pressure, and limited awareness of infectious diseases all contribute to a high incidence of infectious diseases among migrant workers.",

It is reported that in 2006, the migrant population accounted for 1638 of 4088 TB cases in Beijing (Jia et al., 2008). Due to migrant workers' increasing mobility, there was a tenfold increase in the total incidence of syphilis over the past decade (Chen et al., 2007).

However, to the best of our knowledge, no work yet has focused on the spread of infectious diseases in the migrants' home village. Influenced by the Chinese traditional culture, migrant workers regularly return home for holiday family gatherings (especially during the period of Chinese New Year). This mobility pattern may cause an epidemic outbreak in their home village if some of the returning migrant workers were infected with an infectious disease while they were away from their home. For instance, returning migrants with the AIDS virus can unknowingly pass it onto their sexual partners (Lau and Thomas, 2001). In the meantime, migrant workers may also serve as a major vector for bringing the diseases to the urban areas when they return to work from their home village. Movement back and forth between rural and urban areas by temporary migrant workers is believed to be a key factor for the emergence and re-emergence of infectious diseases including TB and HIV/AIDS in China (Jia et al., 2008, Strand et al., 2007, Wang and Shen, 2009).",

It is almost impossible to track each migrant worker's working place. However, it is certain that migrant workers return home regularly. In this paper, we focus on modeling the spread of infectious diseases in a migrants' home village. By proposing a new mathematical model, we aim to investigate the influence of temporary migration on the spread of infectious diseases in a migrant workers' home village assuming some migrant workers return home with an infection.",

For models using delay differential equations in ecology and disease modeling, see Klepac et al. (2007) and Wang, 2009, Wang, 2007 and references cited therein. We should point out that our general model can also be used to explore how international travel by tourists can initiate an epidemic when the tourists return to their home country.",

It is reasonable to focus on the transient behavior (solution behavior during a relatively short time period) rather than the long time behavior. This is mainly because the control strategies may not be the same throughout a long time period and some model parameters may also have different values if the time period is too long. For example, more effective drugs may be developed, which will increase the value of \u03b3, or the migration patterns could change with the development of the economy, which would change the values of m\nS and \u03c4. In particular, we mainly examine the two transient numbers: Imax\u2254max{I(t),t\u22650} (we use t\nmax to denote the peak time at which I\nmax is reached) and I(5), based on the following arguments:\u2022\nI\nmax is certainly a very important indicator for any infectious disease as it gives the largest number of infectious individuals and describes the worst possible situation. It is of importance to examine how different strategies will affect I\nmax.\u2022We evaluate the value of I(5) for different control strategies because in China, the government always comes up with 5-year plans.

In the model, we have assumed that a fraction of returning migrant workers acquired infection when they were away from their home village. This model particularly applies to the huge migrant worker population in China. There has been evidence that migrant workers are more vulnerable to infectious diseases especially TB, HIV/AIDs and STDs because of migrant workers' high risk behaviors (Grusky et al., 2002, Li et al., 2004, Yang, 2006, Yang, 2004).",

This indicates that there is no disease free equilibrium and the disease remains endemic as long as there are cases in temporary migrants. The fact is that the proportion of new cases in migrants has been increasing year by year. It is reported that in 2006, the migrant population accounted for 1638 of 4088 TB cases in Beijing (Jia et al., 2008). Numerical simulations using parameter values derived from available data and TB-related parameters from the literature confirmed that returning infectious migrant workers can cause huge outbreaks in their home village.",

Indeed these two strategies (Strategies I and II) are not practical as the government cannot have a regulation determining the period \u03c4 that a migrant worker can work, and it is not possible to control the migration rate by any regulation. The fact is that both \u03c4 and m\nS seem to have an increasing trend. The most effective measure is a combination of Strategies III, IV and V, that is to reduce three key parameters: p, \u03b2, and q in (3.2). To this end, the following efforts should be encouraged:\u2022The government should improve migrant workers' working and living conditions, offer free or affordable health care, educate them with knowledge of infectious diseases, and encourage their employers to offer free and regular medical examinations as well as suitable medical coverage. This will reduce the value of p.\u2022The local government should encourage returning migrant workers to have medical examinations, offer needed help for quarantine/isolation processes, and have regular education campaigns on basic knowledge and awareness of infectious diseases such as TB, HIV/AIDS and STDs.

Either due to economic pressure, or due to not knowing infection status, some infectious individuals may still migrate to urban areas. This may lead to re-emergence of rather under controlled diseases or emergence of new diseases in urban areas. But because of the current existing household registration system, different jobs and working conditions and different backgrounds, many temporary migrant workers are isolated, not only residentially, but also socially and culturally, from the \u201cmainstream\u201d society in the place where they temporarily live and work (Yang, 2006). A report from the Beijing Municipal Health Bureau shows that the total annual new registered active TB cases increased dramatically from 2000 through 2006, but the cases among the permanent residents only increased slightly (Beijing Research Institute for TB Control Work on the prevention of TB in Beijing). Thus, from a disease prevention and control point of view, temporary migrants should be identified as the target group. Due to migrants' high mobility, lack of knowledge about infectious diseases, poor living and working conditions, and increased (sexual) risk behaviors, a combination of several effective interventions should be implemented.",

For example, all 28 confirmed measles cases reported between 1 January and 30 April 2008 in Canada were either imported or import-related (Lipskie and Varughese, 2008). One Ontario case had arrived from Pakistan 10 days prior to rash onset.
