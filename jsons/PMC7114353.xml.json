            "text": "\nCryptosporidium parvum is a ubiquitous intestinal protozoan parasite that commonly infects dairy calves in the first month of life. Mortality may occur in severely affected animals, but, more often, a self-limiting secretory diarrhea results in morbidity and increased labour and veterinary costs (de Graaf et al., 1999). Infected animals usually shed large numbers of infective oocysts in the feces (Nydam et al., 2001). Detection of these oocysts, or of C. parvum antigen in feces, is the usual means of diagnosis. In dairy calves, the prevalence of shedding has been reported to be highest among animals 7\u201321 days of age, with a pre-patent period of 3\u20136 days (de Graaf et al., 1999). Studies in Canada have reported the prevalence of shedding among dairy calves 0\u201324 weeks of age to be 15\u201359% (Olson et al., 1997a, Olson et al., 1997b). In another study, O\u2019Handley et al. (1999) reported a period prevalence of shedding of 100% among dairy calves from birth to 4 months old on a farm in Alberta, Canada. In 2002, 40.6% of 500 calves aged 7\u201321 days on 51 dairy farms in south-western Ontario were found to be shedding oocysts (Trotz-Williams et al., 2005a).",

A longitudinal study conducted in the United States (USA) found that infected calves were more likely to be found on farms using multi-cow maternity facilities than on those using single-cow facilities (Garber et al., 1994). Frequent bedding changes in the calf housing area, and increased contact between calves, have also been identified as factors associated with an increased risk of C. parvum shedding in dairy calves in the USA (Sischo et al., 2000). Using a cross-sectional study design, Mohammed et al. (1999) found that feeding milk replacer, use of antibiotics and use of fan or exhaust ventilation in calf rearing areas were all associated with a decreased risk of shedding on dairy farms in New York State, USA. In a cross-sectional study conducted in Mexico, use of hay bedding in the maternity area, sweeping the maternity area and feeding starter grain to dairy calves were identified as practices associated with increased shedding of C. parvum (Maldonado-Camargo et al., 1998).",

Moreover, it is unknown whether risk factors for C. parvum shedding and calf diarrhea identified by previous work done in Ontario or elsewhere, are associated with the risk of infection and diarrhea on Ontario dairy farms. This study was carried out with the objective of identifying potential calf-level risk factors for neonatal diarrhea and C. parvum shedding among pre-weaned dairy calves on purposively selected farms with histories of calf diarrhea or cryptosporidiosis in south-western Ontario.",

Approximately 5 g of fresh feces were collected per rectum in a clean screw-topped vial. Fecal samples were collected weekly on subsequent visits, to a total of four samples per calf. The consistency of each fecal sample was recorded at the time of collection by the research technicians, using the scoring system of 1\u20134 described by Larson et al. (1977). Scores of 3 and 4 were regarded as being indicative of diarrhea, while scores of 1 and 2 reflected normal fecal consistency.

Copies of questionnaires were distributed by research technicians and were completed on farm by producers, one following the birth of each calf. At the time of completion of each questionnaire, producers were blind to the status (shedding or non-shedding) of the calf for which information was being recorded. Questions were designed to gather information on management practices reported in the literature as significantly associated with the risk of C. parvum shedding, as well as other factors considered by the authors to be potential predictors of the risk of shedding or calf diarrhea. Examples of factors investigated were ease of birth, amount of time for which the calf had remained with its dam after birth, calving area hygiene, quantity and source of colostrum fed, preventive procedures performed on the neonatal calf such as vaccination and navel-dipping, and type of housing in which the calf was kept for the first 4 weeks of life. A copy of the questionnaire used for this study is available from the authors in English.",

Variables were screened for associations with C. parvum shedding and diarrhea by unvariable multilevel generalized linear mixed modelling, using the \u201cGLLAMM\u201d function in Stata 9.0 with a liberal P-value (0.25). This approach was employed to control for clustering at the herd-level, and repeated observations at the calf-level. During screening, the dependent (outcome) variable used to represent the risk of C. parvum shedding was a dichotomous variable representing the positive or negative status of each fecal specimen. Similarly, the dependent variable used to represent the risk of diarrhea was the diarrheic or non-diarrheic status of individual fecal specimens, with specimens having consistency scores of 3 or 4 classified as diarrheic. The intra-class correlation of C. parvum shedding was estimated using a one-way analysis of variance approach with the \u2018loneway\u2019 command in Stata 9.0. Collinearity between variables was investigated by examination of covariance matrices, and where necessary by cross-tabulations, comprising groups of variables.",

As in univariable modelling, C. parvum shedding status, and diarrhea status of calves at individual weekly sampling times, were used as response variables in modelling risk of shedding and risk of diarrhea, respectively. Where variables were not mutually exclusive and were highly correlated, only one of the related variables was included in model-building, the decision of which to include being made on the basis of distribution and biological plausibility. Models were built by the manual backwards elimination procedure described by Dohoo et al. (2003) with a significance level of P\n > 0.05 as the criterion for removal of a variable from the model. The statistical significance of continuous and dichotomous variables in each model was assessed using Wald's test, and the likelihood ratio test was used to determine the significance of multilevel categorical predictors. The associations between continuous variables and the outcome were assessed for linearity both graphically, and by the inclusion of polynomial terms in the model; variables were assumed to have an approximately linear relationship with the outcome if the coefficients of the polynomial terms were non-significant at the 5% level. Non-linear associations were modelled by categorizing the variable before inclusion in the models. During the model-building process, whether or not a predictor was a confounder was determined by removing the variable and observing the effect on the coefficients of the remaining significant variables; a change of more than 25% in one or more coefficients was regarded as evidence of confounding (Dohoo et al., 2003). Interaction was assessed by the generation of interaction terms amongst variables in the final first-order model and the inclusion of those terms along with the main effects. A P-value of less than 0.05 associated with an interaction term was considered evidence of interaction.",

The quantity of colostrum fed to calves in the first 24 h after birth was also positively associated with the risk of C. parvum shedding. On the other hand, calves that received feed containing coccidiostats, and those born to dams that had been treated with calf-scour prophylactic medications (ScourGuard [Novartis, Ontario] or Ecostar [Pfizer, Ontario]) were significantly less likely to shed C. parvum. Those born in multi-cow calving pens also showed a slightly lower risk of shedding, though this variable appeared to be a confounder and was not significantly associated with shedding at the 5% level (P\n = 0.800). In a previous study, Frank and Kaneene (1993) found that the use of individual maternity stalls was significantly associated with an increased incidence of calf diarrhea in dairy herds with more than 200 cows in Michigan, USA. As is often the case with predictors found to be significantly associated with a response variable in a statistical model, the associations observed in our study may not reflect actual causal or protective relationships. Instead, the predictors included in the model may merely be indicators of other unknown management factors that are directly related to the risk of C. parvum infection and shedding in calves. For example, the negative association between use of calf-scour prophylactic medications in pregnant cows and the risk of shedding may reflect the impact of a generally higher standard of herd management in some herds on the risk of shedding, rather than a direct protective effect, as neither of the medications used is known to provide any protection against C. parvum in calves. Further, it is often difficult to distinguish between calf- and herd-level exposure factors. Indeed, the small number of herds used in this study increases the likelihood that the observed associations may be reflections of individual herd effects instead of true causal associations. Having said that, we believe that our findings will add to the current knowledge of potential risk factors for C. parvum shedding and diarrhea.",

This finding is in contrast to results published by Waltner-Toews et al. (1986), Curtis et al. (1988) and Frank and Kaneene (1993), who found higher incidences of calf diarrhea in the winter in New York, Ontario and Michigan dairies, respectively. However, none of these studies investigated the association between C. parvum shedding and calf diarrhea. Our study demonstrated a strong association between C. parvum shedding and diarrhea, with shedding calves having more than five times the odds of diarrhea than non-shedding calves. No such association was found between the risk of diarrhea and any of the other enteropathogens investigated. Indeed, the adjustment of the coefficient for overall C. parvum status of calves using the method described by Cain and Breslow (1988) and the data collected on other enteropathogens for the second stage sample, resulted in an increased value (farther from the null) for the coefficient. It appears, therefore, that C. parvum was the enteropathogen most strongly associated with diarrhea, as well as, perhaps, the most common cause of calf diarrhea, within our study population. The low predicted probabilities of diarrhea in C. parvum negative calves (Fig. 2), computed from coefficients of the model in Table 4, highlight the importance of the parasite as a cause of scouring, since the overall prevalence of diarrhea in the calves was much higher than the predicted probabilities of scouring in non-shedding calves shown in the graph. The association between C. parvum and diarrhea in calves in Ontario has previously been reported (Trotz-Williams et al., 2005a), and the results of the present study confirm the importance of the parasite as a cause of calf scours in this region. As the risk of C. parvum shedding was significantly higher in the summer months, it follows that the risk of C. parvum-associated diarrhea would also be higher in these calves at that time of the year. It is possible that the cases of diarrhea observed in the calves used in previous studies (Waltner-Toews et al., 1986, Curtis et al., 1988, Frank and Kaneene, 1993) were predominantly caused by enteropathogens other than C. parvum. Furthermore, the fact that the farms used in our study were selected based on a history of calf diarrhea or cryptosporidiosis may have contributed to some of the differences between the findings reported here and those of other researchers.",

Using an experimental approach, Quigley et al. (1994) found that, in a study population of 96 Jersey calves, the prevalence of Cryptosporidium was significantly higher in calves 1 week of age that had been allowed to nurse their dams, than in calves of the same age that had been separated from their dams before they could nurse, and fed colostrum by bottle. However, in our study, no statistically significant association was observed between the risk of shedding and length of time with the dam, either in univariable or in multivariable analysis. The reason for the apparent association between length of stay with dam and the risk of diarrhea in our study may therefore be related to factors other than infection with C. parvum.",

This finding may have been due to better survival of oocysts in the environmental conditions that existed in the summer months, resulting in greater levels of challenge for the animals. Alternatively, other unknown and unmeasured factors that predisposed C. parvum-infected animals to the development of diarrhea may have been more prevalent in the warmer months of the year, either directly or indirectly because of seasonal conditions. Not surprisingly, among the C. parvum-positive calves, the odds of diarrhea in animals shedding more than 2.2 \u00d7 105 oocysts per gram of feces were more than six times the odds in calves shedding fewer than 2.2 \u00d7 105 oocysts per gram of feces.

This would be prudent especially because this is the first published study of its kind conducted in Ontario, and because a large number of potential risk factors were investigated, increasing the likelihood of identifying spurious relationships between variables. Predictors that were significant only at the 25% level but not at the 5% level are particularly likely to be variables that have no true causal association with the outcomes. In addition, many of the variables investigated in this study showed little variation among calves within herds, that is, they were essentially herd-level variables. In view of the fact that only 11 purposively selected farms were used in the study, these variables were therefore less suitable for the identification of calf-level risk factors than the \u2018true\u2019 calf-level variables. As mentioned previously, most of the variation in the risk of infection was between herds, as opposed to within herds. With this in mind, and since many management factors were common to most calves within farms, a separate study specifically designed for the investigation of herd-level factors, and including herds with and without histories of calf diarrhea and cryptosporidiosis, would more effectively disclose any associations that may exist between such factors and the outcomes.",

The work described here has identified some calf-level, as well as a few herd-level, management practices that are potential predictors of the risk of C. parvum shedding and diarrhea among dairy calves in herds experiencing calf diarrhea problems.
