Recently, HRV-C was identified as a new species of HRV, but its spectrum of clinical disease is not well understood. Objectives: We investigated the molecular epidemiology, demographic and clinical characteristics of HRVs among hospitalized children with ALRIs. Study design: One hundred and sixty-five nasopharangeal aspirates taken from children <5 years hospitalized with ALRTIs in Serdang Hospital, Malaysia, were subject to reverse transcriptase-PCR for HRV. Phylogenetic analysis on VP4/VP2 and 5 -NCR regions was used to further characterize HRV. Other respiratory viruses were also investigated using semi-nested multiplex RT-PCR assay. Clinical parameters were analyzed between HRV, RSV and IFV-A mono-infections and between HRV species. Results: HRV was detected in 54 (33%) patients for both single (36 samples) and multiple (18 samples) infections, 61.1% (22/36) represents HRV-A strains while the remaining 14 HRV-C. Strain P51was the first reported representative of HRV98. The majority of the single HRV cases were in the second half of infancy; HRV-C occurred among older children compared with HRV-A. HRV children were admitted significantly earlier and less febrile than RSV and IFV-A infection. HRV-C infected children were more likely to have rhonchi and vomiting as compared to HRV-A. Pneumonia was the most common discharge diagnosis followed by bronchiolitis and post-viral wheeze in HRV patients. Conclusion: Our study showed high prevalence of HRVs and detection of HRV-C among hospitalized children with ALRTIs in Malaysia.

This contradicts with the traditional notion that HRV is only associated with upper respiratory tract infections. Earlier studies indicated that the clinical value of positive PCR is somewhat disputable among patients with ALRTI [3, 7, 19, 21] as asymptomatic HRV infections is known to occur in 15-30% of individuals. Several subsequent clinical studies of small numbers of selected patients showed that HRV can replicate in lower respiratory tract. This finding concluded that detection of HRV especially in children less than 2 years does not simply represent asymptomatic infection but is related to true infection [7, 22] .

Our study revealed that HRV infected children were hospitalized earlier in the course of their disease and were less febrile on presentation as compared to RSV and IFV-A infections. They were also more likely to be discharged earlier and tend to receive lesser antibiotics as compared to the other two infections, especially to RSV. HRV is known to have a shorter incubation period and hence presented earlier as compared with HRV or occasionally with IFV-A especially with H1N1 infection. This could be explained further in terms of the cytopathology on the respiratory epithelial cells as HRV is the least invasive with minimal cell damage and secondary bacterial infection is far less a complication compared to RSV and IFV. As a result, patients were subjected to lesser antibiotics and stayed shorter in the hospital as seen in this study. However, neutrophilia as documented in the present study may not reflect secondary bacterial infection in HRV. Several studies in the past, acknowledged the increase infection in both peripheral and airway neutrophils as a risk to development of asthmatic exacerbations. On the other hand, IFA-A infection tended to be associated with diarrhea, as the infection usually resulted in Table 3 Clinical characteristics of HRV-A and HRV-C single infections. a more systemic involvement with direct invasion of the gastrointestine by the virus [28] . This study further distinguishes certain clinical features of the two species of HRV in ALRTI. Although in general, the clinical presentations were comparable for both HRV-A and C, rhonchi and vomiting were more common in HRV-C infected children as compared to HRV-A. In our study, the presence of rhonchi was associated with ALRTI rather than asthma, as only one had asthma as an underlying disease. As shown in previous studies, this finding further supports the role of HRV-C among patients with febrile wheeze in ALRTI. A large clinical cohort study indicated that this group of children has a preexisting predisposition to asthma in early childhood. On the other hand, vomiting has not been reported in other studies as a prominent presentation in HRV-C. Vomiting with coughing is common in children (post-tussive vomiting) and it could be related to the wheezing episodes in our study and indicate a more severe form of infection in HRV-C as compared to HRV-A. Likewise, no characteristic laboratory finding has been associated previously with any specific HRV species; the modest increase in lymphocytes in HRV-A and neutrophils in HRV-C in our study could be coincidental and probably of no clinical importance. Consistent with the study by Jin [29] , there was no significant difference in terms of disease severity for both species of HRV. On the other hand, Miller [8] found that HRV-C patients were more likely to require supplemental oxygen than HRV-A.
