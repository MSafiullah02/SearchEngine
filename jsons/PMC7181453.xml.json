Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis has emerged as one of the most important food-borne pathogens for humans, and it is mainly associated with the consumption of contaminated poultry meat and egg (1, 2). Infection caused by Salmonella Enteritidis is the second most common cause of bacterial gastroenteritis in the developed world, and results in significant economic loss to the poultry industry and places a substantial burden on the healthcare system (2\u20134). Salmonella Enteritidis is an important pathogen with a public concern, thus demanding further studying. However, the majority of basic researches in Salmonela field still prefer to use Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (Salmonella Typhimurium) as research model to study host-microbial interactions.",

Among the numerous host defense systems against pathogens, anti-bacterial autophagy provides potent cell-autonomous immunity against bacterial attempts to colonize the cytosol of host cells (12, 13). During this process, the phagophore expands and engulfs pathogens, and closes to originate the autophagosome that fuses with the lysosome, at which the degradation of the pathogens takes place (14). There are more than 20 ATG proteins (many of which are evolutionarily conserved) that are essential for the execution of autophagy (15). Notably, the mammalian autophagy protein Beclin-1, an ortholog of the Atg6 in yeast, is a key molecule regulator of autophagy. Beclin-1 interacts with several cofactors (e.g., Atg14L, HMGB1, IP3R, PINK, and survivin) to regulate the lipid kinase Vps-34 protein and promote the formation of Beclin-1-Vps34-Vps15 core complexes, thereby inducing autophagy (16, 17).",

These effector proteins are generally assumed to influence the host's cellular functions to facilitate Salmonella invasion and intracellular carriage (18\u201320). AvrA is one of the Salmonella effectors secreted by the Salmonella pathogenicity island 1 (SPI-1) T3SS. The AvrA protein in Salmonella Typhimurium is an anti-inflammatory effector that possesses acetyltransferase activity and inhibits the host c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)/AP-1 and NF-\u03baB signaling pathways. Through these methods, AvrA inhibits the host inflammatory response and stabilizes the intestinal tight junctions to the benefit of bacterial survival (8, 21\u201325). However, the role of AvrA in the interaction between Salmonella infection and host autophagic response is unexplored.",

After extensive HBSS washing, the extracellular bacteria were washed away. The incubation with gentamicin inhibited the bacterial growth (32).

In this study, we found that in human intestinal epithelial HCT116 cells, the conversion of LC3 I into LC3 II was increased after S.E-AvrA\u2212 infection compared to that after wild-type S.E or S.E-AvrA+ infection. Notably, p62, which is a bona fide target of autophagosomal degradation, was decreased in the cells infected with the S.E-AvrA mutant strain compared with the expression in cells infected with the S.E-WT or S.E-AvrA+ strains (Figure 1A). A densitometry analysis showed a significant difference between the cells infected with the different S.E strains (Figures 1B,C). Meanwhile, HCT116 cells pre-treated with LysoTracker showed more lysosomes in the cells infected with the S.E-AvrA mutant strain than in the cells infected with the AvrA expressed strains (Figures 1D,E). The role of AvrA in Salmonella Enteritidis invasion is unknown. We further compared the invasion ability of Salmonella Enteritidis strains with or without AvrA expression. We found that the bacterial adhesion to human epithelial cells had no significant difference among S.E-WT, S.E-AvrA\u2212 and S.E-AvrA+(Figure 1F). However, S.E-AvrA\u2212 colonized human epithelial cells showed a decreased intracellular bacterial load compared to those colonized with wild type S.E or S.E-AvrA+ (Figure 1G). We observed similar trends in autophagic activity following S.E-AvrA\u2212, S.E-AvrA+ and S.E-WT infection in human Caco-2 BBE and SKCO-15 cells (data not shown). Taken together, these data suggest that the Salmonella Enteritidis effector AvrA inhibits autophagy in vitro.",

Thus, we determined whether the protein level of Beclin-1 was changed by the infection with the different S.E strains. As shown in Figures 2A,B, Beclin-1 protein expression was significantly decreased after colonization of the AvrA present strains for 1 h. In contrast, the cells colonized with the S.E-AvrA\u2212 bacteria maintained Beclin-1 protein expression. To verify that AvrA affects the protein expression of Beclin-1, we transfected an AvrA WT plasmid or an AvrA C186A mutant [mutated at the key cysteine required for AvrA activity (21)] plasmid into HCT116 cells. As expected, the AvrA WT plasmid decreased endogenous Beclin-1 protein expression. However, the AvrA C186A mutant plasmid maintained the endogenous Beclin-1 protein expression (Figures 2C,D). We further determined the interaction of AvrA/Beclin-1 in the HCT116 cells by immunoprecipitation. Vps34 was used as a positive control. We found that exogenous AvrA (c-myc tag) co-immunoprecipitated with exogenous Beclin-1 (HA- tag), suggesting that AvrA interacted with Beclin-1 (Figure 2E). Therefore, the data suggest that the S.E effector AvrA changes Beclin-1 protein levels to inhibit autophagy, in addition AvrA can interact with Beclin-1 protein.",

Meanwhile, a luciferase reporter assay showed that AP-1 transcription was increased, as a consequence of the activation of JNK/c-JUN (Figure 3B). These data suggest that the JNK/c-jun pathway and AP-1 transcription are more highly activated in the S.E-AvrA\u2212-infected cells than in the cells infected with the AvrA present strains. Interestingly, after treatment with the JNK inhibitor SP600125, the level of Beclin-1 and P62 protein expression was not different between the cells infected with AvrA or without AvrA (Figures 3A,B), indicating that the AvrA-related responses were abolished by the JNK inhibitor. Thus, our data indicate that the S.E effector AvrA inhibits the autophagic response by decreasing Beclin-1 at the protein level, and it occurs by inhibiting the JNK/c-Jun/AP-1 signaling pathways.",

Typhimurium is known as an anti-inflammatory effector that possesses acetyltransferase activity toward specific host MAPKKs and inhibits the host JNK/c-Jun/AP-1 and NF-\u03baB pathways, but the role of AvrA from S. Enteritidis is less explored (8, 21\u201325). Here, we demonstrated that S. Enteritidis AvrA inhibited the autophagic response. Beclin-1 protein levels were reduced with AvrA present strain infection. In contrast, S.E-AvrA mutant strain infection maintained Beclin-1 protein expression. Earlier studies on the mechanism underlying the regulation of autophagy in cancer cells showed that the activation of the JNK pathway may be involved in the regulation of Beclin-1 expression, and the latter event could be responsible for the induction of the autophagic response (40). Blocking the JNK pathway might be the reason that AvrA decreases Beclin-1 expression. To verify our results, we used a specific JNK inhibitor SP600125 to block the JNK signaling pathway. After treatment with the JNK inhibitor SP600125, Beclin-1 protein expression did not differ between infection with and without AvrA. The results demonstrated that the S. Enteritidis effector AvrA inhibits the JNK/c-Jun/AP-1 signaling pathway to decrease Beclin-1 expression. Beclin-1 and JNK are also known to regulate apoptosis. Previous studies have demonstrated the effects of AvrA in inhibiting apoptosis and promoting proliferation in vitro and in vivo (21, 22). Taken together, our study has demonstrated a strategy that Salmonella used to impair the autophagic response to the benefit of the pathogen's survival.",

The existing research tends to use Salmonella Typhimurium to study the interaction between host autophagic activity and bacterial invasion. However, Salmonella Enteritidis, which belongs to another Salmonella serotype, could be much difference from Salmonella Typhimurium in host-adaptability, virulence, intracellular survival and so on (47\u201349).",

These results suggested that AvrA decreased the ubiquitination of Beclin-1. A recent study identified S-phase kinase-associated protein 2 (SKP2) as E3 ligase that executes ubiquitination of Beclin-1, thus promoting its proteasomal degradation (50). Inhibition of SKP2 decreases Beclin-1 ubiquitination, decreases BECN1 degradation and enhances autophagic flux. A previous study also has shown that the ubiquitination of Beclin-1 enhances its association with Vps34 to promote Vps34 activity, which plays key role in activation of PI3KC3 complex at the initiation stage of autophagy process (51). AvrA may suppress Beclin-1 ubiquitination to inactivate Vps34 activity, leading to the suppression of autophagy. Certainly, this hypothesis requires further study.",

The granules of Paneth cells contain AMPs\u2013\u03b1-defensins, lysozyme, and secretory phospholipase A2 (53\u201355). Among these, lysozyme is a useful marker of the Paneth cell secretory granule (56). Our data showed that the normal expression pattern of the Paneth cells decreased in the mice infected with the AvrA present strain compared with that in the mice infected with the S.E-AvrA mutant strain. The ileum, after infection with the AvrA present strain, contained an increased proportion of Paneth cells with disorganized or diminished granules or exhibited diffuse cytoplasmic lysozyme staining. These findings suggest that AvrA impairs the autophagic response, and then, the autophagy affects the biosynthesis or quality control of the lysosomal pathway in the Paneth cell granules. Thus, there were fewer normal Paneth cells in the mice infected with the S.E-WT strain. Recently, a study showed that S. Typhimurium invaded Paneth cells, and the invasion was associated with an elevated number of LC3+ puncta in the Paneth cells (57). It is not clear whether S. Enteritidis interact with Paneth cells and affect autophagy through the AvrA effector. Alternatively, the Paneth cells with fewer granules might be a result of Paneth cell exhaustion (43), compensating for the changes elsewhere in the epithelium, due to the survival benefit of Salmonella caused by AvrA suppressing autophagy.",
