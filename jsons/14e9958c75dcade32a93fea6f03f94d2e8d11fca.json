Based on the review of the literature and a variety of examples that focus on the role of information quality in policy design, and drawing on two phenomena from the field of epidemiology (namely, over-adjustment and unnecessary adjustment), the article enhances the definitional clarity of the terms under investigation and allows us to address the difficulty in reconciling technical problem solving with politics. The article proposes new definitional statements of proportionate and disproportionate policy designs that vary according to the extent to which the main design properties are adjusted to low-quality information. It also explores distinct variations in a few policy characteristics resulting from over-and under-design. The policy characteristics examined here include economic efficiency, policy effectiveness, policy robustness; the space for making significant changes at a later stage when high-quality information becomes available; the potential consequences in terms of policy over-and under-reaction; and the political ramifications of these suboptimal designs for elected executives. With regard to the interaction between technical and political logics, the article posits that deliberate policy over-and under-design can be viewed as solutions to serious political problems faced by elected executives, especially in politically sensitive times. Therefore, it facilitates a more realistic understanding of the conditions under which a policy is under-or over-designed to respond to some objectives but entirely proportionate with regard to others.",

A single attempt to clarify their meaning has produced the following definitions: under-design occurs when suboptimal designs are adopted, while over-design, by contrast, results when \"the reverse occurs and resources are wasted in 'over engineering' a design vis \u00e0 vis the significance of the problem\" (Howlett and Kemmerling 2016, 5) .

Information refers here to statistical and qualitative evidence, as well as the beliefs that motivate professionals and mobilize the public (Baumgartner and Jones 2015) . It is a crucial asset for policy designers as well as for 'design-for-policy' entrepreneurs (Lewis et al. 2020) in their daily work, and it is, therefore, the key to many policies and their improvement. Information quality refers to information on costs, timescales, benefits and risks that is accurate, timely, contextually appropriate for the task, clearly represented and accessible to policy designers. To capture the complexity of policy design, the article diverges from the standard policy theory assumption, according to which government efforts are 'seamlessly calibrated' to the policy problem at hand (e.g., Howlett 2019b). It identifies two terms-over-adjustment and unnecessary adjustment-which are drawn from epidemiology, wherein they are used with regard to controlling for relevant covariates when drawing inferences about causation based on observational data regarding exposure to harm (e.g., maternal smoking) and outcome (e.g., neonatal mortality). These terms are employed here in order to advance the definitional clarity of our core constructs, and to address directly the difficulty involved in reconciling technical problem solving with politics.",

Within policy studies, policy design has been linked to research addressing policy implementation and policy instruments (May 2003) , policy ideas and policy formulation (e.g., Linder and Peters 1990a, b; 1991; James and Jorgensen 2009) , and governance (Howlett 2009 (Howlett , 2014 Howlett and Rayner 2007) .

The fact that humans are \"disproportionate information processors\" (Jones 2001, p. 23 ; see also Jones and Baumgartner 2005) can likewise lead to policy over-and under-design. We also make information the primary focus of this article, directing attention to variations among policy designs with regard to their quality of information (Stone 2002, 22) . Therefore, we deviate from the standard policy theory assumption, according to which government efforts are 'seamlessly calibrated' to yield efficient and effective policy solutions to policy problems (Howlett 2019a) , and from the view that policy design and redesign are \"strongly committed towards the 'linear' achievement of an established goal (end-state)\" (Capano 2009, 11) . This divergence from the standard assumption has gained solid support among scholars (e.g., Simon 1973; de Leon 1999; Hargrove 1975; Rittel and Weber 1973; Walker et al. 2001 Walker et al. , 2010 Kwakkel et al. 2010; Howlett 2019a; Mathijssen et al. 2007; Daviter 2019) . Studies have also demonstrated that policy actors interpret scientifically validated information according to their belief-system and mental models (e.g., Sarewitz 2004; Weible et al. 2008; Kahan 2016; Heikkila et al. 2020) ; that there are contextual frictions in the conversion of this information into policy (e.g., Bennett and Howlett 1992; Jasanoff 1987; Radaelli 1995 ; see also Daviter 2015) ; and that when science truly leads policy making, nationally established ideas may place policies on trajectories that ignore countervailing new information until the latter becomes overwhelming (Baekkeskov 2016) . Note that, some policies emerge from a process that is not designed (Howlett and Mukherjee 2014) , and therefore may involve no relevant evidence, and that ideological designs are characterized by the absence of real evidence (Peters 2018, 50) .",

We adopt this broad definition because \" [policy] problems are in part subjective and in part objective, and any policy solution to a problem will have clear distributional effects\" (Baumgartner and Jones 2015, 7) . Information quality is defined as information on costs, timescales, benefits and risks that is accurate, timely, contextually appropriate for the task, clearly represented and accessible to policy designers. It can be measured, for example, by using a questionnaire comprised of 16 dimensions, namely accessibility; the appropriate amount of information; believability; completeness; concise representation; consistent representation; ease of manipulation; freedom from error; interpretability; objectivity; relevancy; reputation; security; timeliness; understandability; and value-added (Strong 2009 ). Operational definition of these dimensions could be found elsewhere (Wang and Strong 1996; Najjar and Schniederjans 2006) . Information quality includes therefore both objective dimensions (e.g., accuracy) as well as subjective dimensions that are defined relative to the context of a policy designer performing a certain task which requires the information (e.g., timeliness) (e.g., Strong 2009; English 2001; Mai 2013; Gustavsson and W\u00e4nstr\u00f6m 2009) .",

Misleading statistics may originate, for example, from errors in assumptions. Specifically, over-design may incur additional costs when actual conditions are less severe than assumed conditions, while additional failures may result from under-design when actual conditions are more severe than the assumed design conditions. Another example is a situation involving the mistaken assumption that a certain capacity of a policy-related element will follow the normal distribution in the event of a flood, when, in fact, it follows a gamma distribution, thereby leading to over-design. Alternatively, statistical errors may occur in sampling. The ineffectiveness of a sample affects trend detection: positive and negative autocorrelation lead to overestimation and underestimation, respectively, of a trend. Errors in trend detection can lead to either over-design or under-design, thereby misleading policy designers (Pathak et al. 2017 ). In addition to errors in assumptions and sampling, data gaps in big data pertaining, for example, to minority groups (Giest and Samuels 2020), can furthermore undermine the quality of information available to policy designers.",

Not surprisingly, information selection lies at the core of decision-making in the policy design process (Simon 1973) . A major obstacle in executing this task is information overload (e.g., Edmunds and Morris 2000; Jansen 2008), which may be strategically induced (Persson 2018 ) by a variety of policy entrepreneurs (e.g., Maor 2017a) and other actors. Studies have also discussed information avoidance (Case et al. 2005) or filtering (Miller 1960 ) by decision-makers. In political science, Walgrave and Dejaeghere (2017) demonstrated that politicians partially outsource their information selection to procedures and/or staff members, personally apply rigorous rules of thumb concerning what they should attend to and what they should not, and compensate for the pressure and constant risk of error with a large dose of self-confidence. Given the limited capacity of the human brain and the fact that much information is noise (Gigerenzer and Todd 1999) , focusing on the variance in the quality of information available to policy designers during a policy design process can give the terms under investigation an analytical value. Attention first turns to the definition of proportionate policy design.",

The abundance of information of varying quality requires policy designers to separate the wheat from the chaff, that is, to gather the information necessary to formulate stable policy rules and to allow for some degree of freedom to adjust policy incentives over time in order to increase social welfare. Yet it also requires that policy designers ignore some information, preferably low-quality, unnecessary information. The study of heuristics-efficient cognitive processes that ignore information-indeed shows that less information, computation and time can improve accuracy (Gigerenzer and Brighton 2009) .

The same rationale may be applied to relationships among policy problem elements-the substantive nature of the policy problem (Peters 2005; Peters and Hoornbeek 2017)-if those are viewed as implicit or explicit forms of constraints. Gathering high-quality information regarding external and/or internal constraints is vital if policy designers need to accommodate abstract information or any information which is temporarily indistinguishable from random data (e.g., when the definitions of the policy problem and the viability of policy solutions are not stable across time; Rice and Fineman 2004) .",

An example of a proportionate design for a simple problem and a simple solution is automobile speeding regulation (Howlett 2019a, 17) . Another example is the design of the national electricity transmission systems in France and the UK in the middle of the twentieth century, which superimposed the national priorities upon the regional and local. This resulted in well-designed and efficient systems, in comparison with many other European countries in which local municipalities were allowed to maintain control, resulting in weak networks (Helm 2014 ).

Drugs submitted to the FDA for review between 1989 and 2000 that underwent review by an advisory committee before approval were significantly less likely to encounter safety problems after they were released into the market (e.g., drug warnings and withdrawal from the market) than those which did not receive an advisory committee review, all else being equal (Moffitt 2014) .

Policy designers may consequently find themselves relying on statistical models characterized by poor generalization ability. Over-adjustment occurs when an adjustment is undertaken for intermediate variables even though the total causal effect of policy instruments on policy outcome is of interest. Such an adjustment will often bias estimates of the total causal effect toward null (Schisterman et al. 2009 ).

Unnecessary adjustment during the policy design stage is a phenomenon that occurs when policy designers' control for a variable does not affect the expectations regarding the estimate of the total causal effect between a policy instrument and a policy outcome (adapted from Schisterman et al. 2009 ). Unnecessary adjustment in cases of technical problem-solving may occur, among others, in three cases: (1) adjusting for a completely irrelevant variable; (2) adjusting for a variable that causes solely negligible (policy) outcomes; and (3) adjusting for a variable whose only causal association with variables of interest is limited because it is not in the causal pathway identified. The result of adjustment for such variables is that the total causal effect of a policy tool on policy outcome remains unchanged (in expectation). Some unnecessary adjustment of variables could harm designers' estimates by decreasing the precision of the policy design. This, in turn, entails the risk of undermining policy reliability. However, when combined with highquality information it increases the probability that some of the power of the policy instruments will not be used to support the policy's performance.",

An example is the crime and punishment bubble in the USA in the 2000s (Jones et al. 2014) , especially the over-criminalization of drug use and possession, which has been manifested by over 1 million drug possession arrests by police each year (FBI 2017).

This is most likely to occur when the implementation of over-designed policy is (significantly) undermined by the complexity of the design. Regarding policy effectiveness, although over-designed policies are not economical and involve wasted resources, they do not necessarily preclude the achievement of policy goals.

Furthermore, if a policy design involving financial assets does not include strict financial regulations (hence, under-designed policy), financial bubbles are highly likely to emerge. An example is the European Union Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS), which underestimated the fact that carbon allowances are financial assets, potentially vulnerable to the behavior of traders and investors. This scheme led to episodes of speculation and price bubbles related to energy and environmental policy announcements (Cret\u00ed and Jo\u00ebts 2017) . Importantly, as long as the risk of failure does not materialize, under-designed policies may be (wrongly) perceived by the public as proportionate.

Scholars can thereafter examine the role played by information quality in how policy is under-or over-designed. They may also use the Information Quality Assessment (IQA) questionnaire, which measures information quality along 16 dimensions that were verified in different organizational contexts and by numerous studies, alongside objective measures that do not require data or policy designer's time for the purposes of assessment (Strong 2009 ).",

Alternatively, researchers can utilize randomized survey experiments as well as laboratory experiments involving the direct manipulation of information quality. One experiment can test the hypothesis that, in cases of a complex policy problem and a complex policy solution, low-quality information influences policy designers' interpretations of high-quality information. Another experiment can test the effect of adding more high-quality information into the policy design process. The evidence can be constructed to demonstrate that only one interpretation is correct or, alternatively that numerous interpretations are correct. The experimental groups may vary, among other differences, with regard to whether or not the identity of the information providers is visible to the respondents.",

Scholars should also pay attention to the context within which policy-makers operate.

Future theorizing and empirical research must pay greater attention to the role of time in such processes; how and why such processes change and evolve over time; how the changes in the role played by businesses and civil society in such processes affect policy design outcomes; and how different macro-social factors generate such processes.
