A PHEIC must: (1) constitute a health risk to other countries through international spread; (2) potentially require a coordinated response because it is unexpected, serious, or unusual; and (3) have implications beyond the affected country that could require immediate action.",

During one country representative's account of Zika virus in French Polynesia, robust and convincing retrospective data were presented about an increase in neurological disorders during the period when there was an outbreak of Zika virus. Other presentations described current clusters of microcephaly and limited information about Zika virus identified in fetuses or infants, pointing out the temporal association with circulation of the Zika virus.",

Upon further discussion, it became clear that there was no standard surveillance case definition for microcephaly. The first recommendation of the PHEIC was to call for standardised and enhanced surveillance of microcephaly in areas of known Zika virus transmission. Such surveillance is not only important in countries where there are current and recent outbreaks, but is also retrospectively relevant in African and Asian countries where outbreaks have been occurring since the Zika virus was first identified in 1947.5, 6 Further, we felt that surveillance data should become available within months.",

Neurological fetal defects occur with other viral infections such as rubella, which are preventable by vaccine,7 and could also be caused by factors such as exposure to chemicals or toxins and other environmental factors.8, 9 We understood that this PHEIC recommendation will take much longer to implement than surveillance, and will require accumulation of scientific evidence from post-mortem analyses, case-control studies, and other studies as recommended by experts in microcephaly, obstetric and neonatal medicine, and public health. Part of our discussion also included the need for development of an animal model, and of the possibility of eventually proving Koch's postulates.",
