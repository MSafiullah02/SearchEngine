Unrooted trees are beneficial in depicting clusters of related sequences. Unrooted gene trees have also become more prevalent within the multispecies coalescent phylogenetic framework, leading to systematic approaches for inferring unrooted species trees from unrooted gene tree topologies (Liu and Yu, 2011). Gene trees and species trees can have similar topologies but often there is considerable discordance between gene tree and species trees (Degnan, 2013). For this reason, understanding how to root gene trees will have implications for accurate species tree inference (Figures 1(b) and 1(c)).",

Outgroup method assumes that one or more of the taxa are divergent from the rest of the taxa (ingroup). The branch linking the ingroup and outgroup becomes the starting point, and defines all subsequent evolutionary events within the tree (Brady et al., 2011, Williams, 2014). In addition to providing evolutionary information of the ingroup, the outgroup has other additional functions. It allows the identification of distinct features within ingroup sequences (Wheeler, 1990). An important aspect of outgroup method is the need for a priori knowledge on the appropriate outgroup to use for the set of sequences (Wheeler, 1990, Hess and De Moraes Russo, 2007). However, this is also the main bottleneck for this method, especially within higher taxonomic groups such as angiosperms, birds, and mammals where a consensus outgroup is lacking (Qiu et al., 2001). As a consequence, many authors are forced to choose between different sorts of outgroups that are either phylogenetically close or phylogenetically distant (Rota-Stabelli and Telford, 2008).",

LBA occurs mainly when the outgroup taxa are distantly related to the ingroup due to either large divergence time and/or increased rate of evolution (Tarr\u00edo et al., 2000). This results in homoplastic changes occurring at rapidly evolving sites thus resulting in artifactual rooting (random rooting) (Wheeler, 1990, Hendy and Penny, 2011, Maddison et al., 1984). Several criteria have been proposed to prevent LBA within phylogenetic trees, through a multistep process as proposed by Rota-Stabelli and Telford (2008) to assist in outgroup selection especially in the case of arthropod classes. They include: (1) low substitution rate; (2) ingroup like G+C composition; (3) new strand bias estimators \u2018skew index\u2019; (4) the tendency of the outgroup to avoid \u2018random branding effect\u2019; and (5) phylogenetic proximity to the arthropod.",

Using Pontederiaceae, an aquatic monocot, as the case study they assessed how the nearest outgroup provides for rooting Pontederiaceae compared to those less closely related relatives and further investigate the role of LBA when determining the optimal rooting of Pontederiaceae. However, they concluded that LBA may influence rooting, and may be supporting the wrong outgroup. To further reduce LBA and to ensure robustness of the outgroup rooting method they recommend multiple sampling of outgroups within the sister group rather than sampling within less closely related taxa.",

Homogeneity is assumed across the branch and that the two most divergent taxa evolved at equal rates (Holland et al., 2003; Swofford et al., 1996).

For example, Stavrinides and Guttman (2004) utilize midpoint rooting to establish the evolutionary relationship of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronaviruses. They carried out phylogenetic analysis of the viral genes encoding for viral structural proteins specifically, envelope matrix (M) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins. The midpoint rooting of the trees generated using the M protein data shows two groups, one that consisted of porcine, feline, and canine and one that contained bovine and murine coronaviruses (Coronaviridae). On the other hand, the N protein tree is midpoint rooted on the branch leading to the group 1 coronaviruses. Moreover, the appropriateness of midpoint rooting is supported by the results of Tajima\u2019s relative rate test (Tajima, 1993), indicating no rate heterogeneity among the coronavirus groups (Stavrinides and Guttman, 2004).",

            "text": "The molecular clock rooting method has one assumption: the rate of evolution is constant for the sequences of interest (Yang and Rannala, 2012). The rate is typically expressed in substitutions per site per year or substitutions per site per million years (Brown and Yang, 2011). The strict clock is often used in analyses of sequences sampled at the intraspecific level, for which usually there is an exceptionally low rate of variation (Brown and Yang, 2011, Ho and Duch\u00eane, 2014). The molecular clock assumption becomes problematic for distantly related species because there is a linear relationship between the genetic distances and approximate divergence. The slope of the line directly corresponds to the evolutionary rate variation among species especially among divergent taxa (Welch and Bromham, 2005). Before utilizing the molecular clock method for rooting a phylogenetic tree users should test if a molecular clock is appropriate to describe the data. Testing for the molecular clock entails generating two maximum likelihood trees, one computed with the molecular clock enforced and one without the molecular clock enforced and then utilizing the likelihood ratio test (Felsenstein, 1983, Holder and Lewis, 2003).",

After obtaining the posterior distribution of trees under Bayesian inference, the root of the tree is inferred to be the root position with the highest posterior probability. This method also provides the posterior probability that the root lies on any branch of the ingroup topology. Another advantage of the Bayesian method is that it allows the user to evaluate alternative rootings. Other rooting methods only return one rooting for a particular dataset, without any numerical assessment of confidence in that rooting. A Bayesian molecular clock analysis successfully identified the root of Orcuttieae (Poaceae) (Boykin et al., 2010) when all other methods failed. Post_root was developed to analyze the output from MrBayes (Ronquist et al., 2012) or ExaBayes (Aberer et al., 2014) runs. The output from Post_Root will give the number of unique roots and also the most probable root position.",
