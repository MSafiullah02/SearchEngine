Taking these considerations into account, we hypothesized that since the onset of the containment, the number of patients admitted to intensive cardiac care units (ICCUs) for AMI or acute heart failure (AHF) could have fallen. If true, the COVID-19 pandemic might increase cardiovascular death in multiple ways, weakening patients with pre-existing cardiovascular conditions, generating inflammatory myocarditis and reducing our ability to quickly evaluate patients with acute cardiovascular disease who are not infected with COVID-19 (or concomitantly those who are infected with COVID-19) [1] .",

To be as fair as possible in this evaluation, we considered only large centres outside the epicentre of the pandemic in France (i.e. not in the east of the country). About one-third of the university centres answered, and extensively documented the numbers of patients admitted to ICCUs in March 2020, to enable us to follow the effect of this present unprecedented situation. The mean number of admissions by centre was computed each day. These means were compared before and under containment, using a Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test.",

During the same period, ICCUs admitted 1.0 \u00b1 0.7 patients with ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) per day, versus 0.6 \u00b1 0.7 after containment (rank-sum test P = 0.02), 1.4 \u00b1 0.8 patients with non-STEMI per day, versus 0.5 \u00b1 0.7 after containment (ranksum test P = 0.0009), and 1.5 \u00b1 0.9 patients with AHF per day, versus 0.8 \u00b1 1.0 after containment (rank-sum test P = 0.002). Details are provided in Fig. 1, Fig. A.1 self-censorship, because of fear of possible in-hospital contamination or a lengthy wait before consultation in an overcrowded emergency room. Patients may also have refrained from consulting cardiologists, delaying detection of heart failure or worsening of coronary artery disease, and subsequent referral to an ICCU. Primary care physicians might not be available because of viral sickness or the reduction of non-urgent activity. The prehospital emergency system is probably unable to answer all the calls being made. Hospitals have allocated most resources to the COVID-19 challenges, so fewer resources are available for acute cardiac care. Importantly, similar considerations could be valid in all other acute situations. Finally, contained patients have probably significantly reduced their physical activity, with a possible reduction in the coronary plaque rupture that is responsible for AMI; it has been established that intense physical activity favours plaque rupture [3] . However, there are few data on the effect of a dramatic decrease in physical exertion on plaque stabilization.",
