Sacc., the Chinese caterpillar fungus or DongChongXiaCao (winter worm-summer grass) in Chinese or Tochukaso in Japanese, is a valuable medicinal fungus in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM). C. sinensis is a parasitic fungus to the moth larvae (Lepidoptera) of Hepialus armoricanus (and Thitarodes). In late summer or early autumn, the larvae are infected by the fungal spores and gradually consumed by the fungal mycelia, and turned into \u201cstiff worms\u201d in winter. In spring and early summer of the following year, a stroma or fruiting body forms on the larva head, grows and emerges out of the ground like a grass (Fig. 1\n) (Chen et al., 2013, Holliday and Cleaver, 2008, Li and Tsim, 2004; Lo et al., 2013, Winkler, 2010, Zhang et al., 2012a, Zhu et al., 1998). The natural C. sinensis fruiting body-caterpillar complexes are mainly distributed on the high plateaus of 3500\u20135000 m above sea level in Tibet, Qinghai, Sichuan, and Yunnan Provinces in China (Li et al., 2011).",

Modern pharmacological studies have shown its therapeutic effects on a wide range of diseases and conditions, such as respiratory, renal, liver, nervous system, and cardiovascular diseases, as well as tumours, aging, hyposexuality, and hyperlipidaemia (Ding et al., 2011, Ji et al., 2009, Liu et al., 2010, Lo et al., 2013, Marchbank et al., 2011, Song et al., 2010, Yue et al., 2013, Zhang et al., 2011, Zhu et al., 1998). C. sinensis has been listed as an herbal drug in the official Chinese Pharmacopoeia by the Committee of Pharmacopoeia and Chinese Ministry of Health since 1964. During the outbreak of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in China in 2003, there was a notable increase in the use of C. sinensis. Over the last 10 years, the demand as well as the price for C. sinensis has increased dramatically in China, Japan, Korea and India (Au et al., 2012, Jeffrey, 2012, Winkler, 2009). As natural C. sinensis are very limited and cannot meet the increasing demand, fermentation technology has been widely exploited for large-scale production of C. sinensis fungal mycelia and other useful constituents. The fermentation-cultivated mycelia of some fungal strains isolated from the natural C. sinensis have been shown to produce the similar pharmacological efficacy to the wild fungal materials and been widely applied to various health food products (Zhu et al., 1998).",

            "text": "The multiple pharmacological effects of C. sinensis can be attributed to its chemical ingredients, including polysaccharides, proteins, nucleotides, mannitol, ergosterol, aminophenol, fatty acids, and trace elements. Actually, several reviews on these compounds and their properties and bioactivities of C. sinensis have been published in the last few years (Chen et al., 2013, Paterson, 2008, Shashidhar et al., 2013, Zhao et al., 2013, Zhong et al., 2009). In particular, polysaccharides represent one of the most abundant components in the fungus and a major group of bioactive constituents which have been extracted and isolated from the fruiting bodies, cultured mycelium, and fermentation broth, which are structurally diverse biomacromolecules with various physiochemical properties. Polysaccharides have been the target for the development and quality control of C. sinensis health products. More recently, some reviews on extraction, isolation, structure and bioactivities of polysaccharides from C. sinensis have appeared (Lo et al., 2013, Nie et al., 2013, Xiao, 2008, Zhong et al., 2009). However, these reviews mainly focus on separation techniques, structural features and bioactivities of intracellular polysaccharides (IPSs) from the fruiting body of natural C. sinensis and mycelia of cultured C. sinensis, but the mycelial fermentation, physicochemical properties and pharmacological activities of extracellular polysaccharides or exopolysaccharides (EPSs) isolated from culture broth of C. sinensis are less involved. In addition, the relationships are still not well established between the molecular structure and the bioactivity of C. sinensis derived polysaccharides. Herein, this review summarizes and compares the recent studies on the production, extraction, and purification of IPSs and EPSs from C. sinensis as well as the characterization of their structural features, chain conformations, and bioactivities.",

Table 1\nprovides a summary of the strains, culture conditions, mycelial biomass and EPS yields of C. sinensis which have been reported in the literature. The biomass and EPS yields varied in a wide range from 10 to 54 g/L, and <1.0 to >40 g/L with the fungal species and culture conditions, respectively. In particular, our group has previously demonstrated the optimization of submerged culture conditions for C. sinensis (Cs-HK1), such as temperature, initial pH, carbon and nitrogen levels, minerals, and surfactants (Tween 80) (Leung and Wu, 2007, Leung et al., 2006, Liu and Wu, 2012). However, the production of bioactive EPS by liquid fermentation of edible or medicinal fungi (e.g. C. sinensis) is still a new area of research without much industrial application. Thus, there is a need to enhance the EPS productivity through effective strategies of process intensification in the future.",

            "text": "\nC. sinensis polysaccharides can be classified into two types according to their locations in the fungal cells, intracellular polysaccharides (IPSs) and extracellular polysaccharides (exopolysaccharides, EPSs). IPSs are extracted from the fruiting body (or worm) and mycelium of C. sinensis with pure water, aqueous acidic/alkaline solutions, aqueous buffers under heating (Guan et al., 2011, Kiho et al., 1999, Kiho et al., 1986, Kiho et al., 1996, Wang et al., 2009, Wu et al., 2007, Wu et al., 2005, Wu et al., 2005, Wu et al., 2006, Wu et al., 2006, Yan et al., 2011). Extraction in hot or boiling water is the most common and convenient method for extracting water-soluble mushroom polysaccharides. However, the major drawbacks of hot water extraction are the high extraction temperature, long extraction time and low extraction efficiency. Various methods have been used to improve the extraction efficiency such as treatment with enzymes, microwave and high power ultrasound (Wang et al., 2011, Xie et al., 2009). The application of high-power or high-intensity ultrasound or ultrasound-assisted extraction (UAE) has been widely studied for extracting polysaccharides from different plant materials. The enhancement of extraction efficiency by UAE is mainly attributed to the mechanical effects of ultrasound, particularly the shear forces arising from acoustic cavitation (Velickovic, Milenovic, Ristic, & Veljkovic, 2006). On the other hand, for extraction of EPSs, the fermentation broth of C. sinensis was sequentially centrifuged and concentrated, and the resultant material was precipitated by using ethanol, and then centrifuged to harvest the crude EPSs. Fig. 2\nsummarizes the isolation procedures of IPSs and EPSs from C. sinensis.",

            "text": "IPSs from natural and cultured C. sinensis usually consist of glucose, mannose, and galactose with 1 \u2192 4(6)-glucopyranosyl (Glcp), 1 \u2192 6-mannopyranosyl (Manp), and 1 \u2192 4(6)-galactopyranosyl (Galp) (Guan et al., 2011, Nie et al., 2013, Zhong et al., 2009, Zhou et al., 2009). The earliest reports on IPSs by Miyazaki et al. (1977) and Kiho et al. (1986) included a galactomannan designated CS-I from a hot-water extract and a water-soluble, protein-containing galactomannan (CT-4N) isolated from a 5% sodium carbonate extract of C. sinensis, respectively. Both IPSs contained (1 \u2192 2)-linked d-mannopyranosyl main-chains and (1 \u2192 5)-linked d-galactofuranosyl side-chains. However, significant differences between CS-I and CT-4N were observed, i.e., CS-I contains (1 \u2192 2,3) linkages of d-mannopyranose residues, as well as (1 \u2192 3) and (1 \u2192 6) linkages of galactofuranose, but CT-4 N has (1 \u2192 4,6) linkages of mannopyranose and (1 \u2192 6) linkages of galactopyranose. Thus, galactomannans from C. sinensis have a core of d-mannopyranosyl residues and d-galactofuranosyl side chains, and some differences in the linkage mode are observed. In addition, a galactoglucomannan named CS-F10 (Kiho et al., 1999) isolated from C. sinensis mycelium had a comb-type structure composed of non-reducing terminal \u03b1-d-glucopyranosyl residues, (1 \u2192 5 and/or 6)-linked \u03b2-d-galactofuranosyl residues, as well as (1 \u2192 2)-linked and branched \u03b1-d-mannopyranosyl residues. Recently, some water-soluble IPSs isolated from the cultured C. sinensis have been identified as glucomannogalactans, whose backbone were mainly composed of (1 \u2192 2) and (1 \u2192 4)-linkage of mannose, (1 \u2192 3)-linkage of galactose, (1 \u2192 ), and (1 \u2192 3,6)-linkage of glucose (Nie et al., 2011, Wang et al., 2009). Furthermore, a novel neutral mannoglucan isolated from C. sinensis mycelium has a backbone of predominantly (1 \u2192 4)-linked \u03b1-d-Glcp (61.3%) together with a proportion of (1 \u2192 3)-linked \u03b1-d-Glcp residues (28.0%), with single \u03b1-d-Manp units (10.7%) as the side chains attached to C-6 of (1 \u2192 3)-linked d-Glcp residue (Wu et al., 2007). Similarly, Wang, Yin et al. (2010) reported the chemical structure of a water-soluble polysaccharide (CPS-2) isolated from cultured C. sinensis, which was composed mostly of a \u03b1-(1 \u2192 4)-d-glucose and a \u03b1-(1 \u2192 3)-d-mannose branched with \u03b1-(1 \u2192 4,6)-d-glucose every twelve residues on average. Based on the above reports, it can be concluded that heteropolysaccharides are the most common bioactive polysaccharides in the fruiting bodies and mycelia of C. sinensis.",

Furthermore, Akaki et al. (2009) reported that an insoluble polysaccharide (CS-Pp) purified from the cultured mycelium of C. sinensis was a 1,3-\u03b2-d-glucan with some 1,6-branched chains.

(2010) reported the isolation and structure of EPS-1A from a fermentation broth of C. sinensis Cs-HK1. EPS-1A was found to be a slightly branched polysaccharide with its backbone being composed of (1 \u2192 6)-\u03b1-d-glucose residues (\u223c77%) and (1 \u2192 6)-\u03b1-d-mannose residues (\u223c23%). Branching occurred at the O-3 position of (1 \u2192 6)-\u03b1-d-mannose residues of the backbone with (1 \u2192 6)-\u03b1-d-mannose residues and (1 \u2192 6)-\u03b1-d-glucose residues and terminated with \u03b2-d-galactose residues.

In addition, a novel poly-N-acetylhexosamine (polyhexNAc) of about 6 kDa was isolated from the low-MW fraction of EPS produced from the liquid fermentation of C. sinensis Cs-HK1. The molecular structure was elucidated as a [-4-\u03b2-d-ManNAc-(1 \u2192 3)-\u03b2-d-GalNAc-(1 \u2192 ] disaccharide repeating unit in the main chain with a Gal branch randomly occurring at the 3-position of ManNAc (Chen, Siu et al., 2013).",

In general, polysaccharides in aqueous solutions exhibit different forms of chain conformations, such as random coil (Senti et al., 1955), various helical forms, single helix, double helix, triple helix (Kashiwagi et al., 1981, Sato et al., 1984, Zhang and Yang, 1995), and aggregate (Ding, Jiang, Zhang, & Wu, 1998). A few reports are available on the solution properties and chain conformations of C. sinensis polysaccharides. For example, Cai, Li, and Lu (1999) firstly developed a method to study the morphology of a IPS by atomic force microscopy (AFM). Their results show that this IPS has a multi-branched structure and various linkages between adjacent monosaccharides, which make up small rings and helical structures. Very recently, the morphological characteristics and chain conformation of EPS isolated from a mycelial culture of C. sinensis Cs-HK1 have been analyzed by AFM together with the Congo red test, optical rotation, and dynamic light scattering. Results suggest that this EPS forms large interwoven networks in aqueous solution and is primarily connected with triple-helical conformation and occasionally single-helical conformation in solution. However, IPSs obtained from Cs-HK1 mycelium exhibit random coils in aqueous alkaline solutions (Wang et al., 2010, Wang et al., 2011, Yan et al., 2011). In addition, the random coils or aggregated networks of EPS-1 formed in aqueous solution were transformed into the single helices after sulfation (Yan, Wang, Ma, & Wu, 2013).",

Phagocyte release is an early step in the response of macrophages to pathogen invasion of the human body. Macrophages can also defend against pathogen invasion by secreting proinflammatory cytokines [e.g., tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 and interleukin (IL)-1] and releasing cytotoxic and inflammatory molecules [e.g., nitric oxide (NO) and reactive oxygen species] (Medzhitov, & Janeway, 2000).",

IPSs obtained from the mycelia of C. sinensis are effective against sarcoma 180, with almost 90% inhibition in ICR/JCL mice (Wu et al., 2005, Zhang et al., 2007). In addition, EPSs obtained from a cultured broth of C. sinensis significantly lowers c-Myc, c-Fos, and vascular endothelial growth factor expression in B16 melanoma-bearing mice. Thus, EPSs can inhibit tumour growth in the lungs and liver of mice and can be a potential adjuvant in cancer therapy (Yang et al., 2005).",

An EPS isolated from one of the anamorph strains of C. sinensis belonging to Tolypocladium spp. is found to significantly enhance the neutral red uptake capacity of peritoneal macrophages and spleen lymphocyte proliferation in B16-bearing mouse. The metastasis of B16 melanoma cells in lungs and liver is also significantly inhibited. Moreover, this EPS can markedly prevent H22 tumour growth and elevate immunocyte activity in H22 tumour-bearing mice, indicating that EPSs inhibit tumour cells mainly by activating the host\u2019s immune system (Zhang et al., 2008, Zhang et al., 2005). To confirm this finding, Sheng, Chen, Li, and Zhang (2011) investigated the effects of EPSs on immunocytes in vitro, and results indicate that EPS treatment significantly promotes the mRNA and protein levels of TNF-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b3. This phenomenon supports the assumption that antitumour activity is related to the promoted cytokine expression of immunocytes. EPSs can also stimulate the maturation and activation of murine and human dendritic cells by inhibiting STAT3 activation (Huang et al., 2011, Song et al., 2011). Furthermore, EPS may induce dendritic cell sarcoma (DCS) cells to exhibit mature characteristics, and the mechanism involved is probably related to the inhibition of the JAK2/STAT3 signal pathway and promotion of the NF-\u03baB signal pathway (Song et al., 2013). On the other hand, IPSs can also activate many immune cells to modulate the release of cell signal messengers such as cytokines, and increased cytokine production in immune cells has been studied in mice and humans (Chen et al., 1997, Yoon et al., 2008).",

Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL are probably among these proteins as revealed by results of immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting (Yang et al., 1999, Yang et al., 2003).

Shen, Shao, Ni, Xu, and Tong (2009) reported the effects of the polysaccharide fraction of C. sinensis (PSCS) on triptolide (TPL)-induced apoptosis in HL-60 cells and the molecular events and signaling pathway, enhancing TPL-induced apoptosis and inhibiting the expression of NF-\u03baB and caspases 3, 6, 7, and 9.

Their results show that Cordyceps generally possesses strong antioxidative activity in all assays, and cultured Cordyceps mycelia have antioxidative activity as strong as that of natural C. sinensis. Further testing suggests that several forms of IPSs prepared by ethanol precipitation and DEAE column chromatography have great antioxidative activities. Li et al. (2003) used column chromatography to purify a polysaccharide-enriched fraction isolated from cultured C. sinensis that possesses strong oxidative activity. A polysaccharide named CSP-1 is then obtained using activity-guided fractionation. CSP-1 with a MW of 210 kDa is found to have strong antioxidative activity in rat pheochromocytoma PC12 cells, protecting against H2O2-induced cell damage, lipid peroxidation, and activation of major antioxidant enzymes, including glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase in cells. Very recently, an APS has been isolated from Tolypocladium sinensis, another anamorph strain of C. sinensis. This APS is found to markedly protect PC12 cells from H2O2-induced cell injury by increasing glutathione peroxidase, catalase, and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities, as well as by reducing lactate dehydrogenase and malondialdehyde (MDA) levels (Shen, Song, Wu, & Zhang, 2011). In addition, IPSs also affect the antioxidative activity of H22-bearing mice by enhancing the SOD activity of the liver, brain, and serum, as well as the GSH-Px activity of the liver and brain in tumour-bearing mice, and by reducing the MDA level in the liver and brain of tumour-bearing mice (Chen et al., 2006).",

IPSs also significantly lowered the levels of plasma triglyceride and cholesterol in mice and increase the activities of hepatic glucokinase, hexokinase, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (Kiho et al., 1993, Kiho et al., 1996, Kiho et al., 1999).",

Polysaccharides have been identified as the major active components of C. sinensis with a wide range of bioactivities including immunomodulation, antitumour, antioxidation, and hypoglycemic effects. Fermentation production, isolation, structural characterization, and the bioactivities of polysaccharides from different wild or natural C. sinensis have been extensively investigated in recent years, mainly in China, Japan, and Korea. However, the relationship between structural features, solution behavior, space conformation, and their bioactivity is unclear due to the structural diversity and complexity of polysaccharide molecules. The fruiting bodies or mycelial biomass as the sources of IPSs, especially EPSs isolated from the culture broth, have attained from different C. sinensis species and in various conditions. Because of the variable properties of raw material and the composition of polysaccharides, it is difficult to maintain consistency, reproducibility and reliability of the results. There is a need to establish standard protocols for collection and preparation of the source material and for the extraction, isolation and purification of polysaccharides. These will be useful for determination of the chemical structures and chain conformations and the biological activities and for applications in food, medicine and cosmetic products.",
