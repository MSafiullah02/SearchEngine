Activated lymphocytes result in the production of cytokines and inflammatory mediators, which contribute to the increased capillary permeability and kidney injury. It is believed that the immune system malfunction, rather than direct viral cytotoxicity, is the primary cause of vascular leakage and development of HFRS [8\u201311].",

It can suppress T cell chemotaxis, and regulate differentiation and maturation of dendritic cells and macrophages. DcR3 also can down-regulate several co-stimulatory molecules [17\u201320]. Clinical data show that DcR3 can be detected in various diseases such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS,) inflamed intestinal epithelia, and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) [21\u201323]. HFRS is an infectious disease mediated by immune and inflammatory responses. Therefore, monitoring the levels of serum DcR3 in HFRS patients might aid in delineating the pathogenesis of HFRS.",

Moreover, the levels of serum DcR3 in patients with HFRS change from low to high following an order from mild group, moderate group, severe group to critical group during five phases. These findings suggest that the dynamic changes of serum DcR3 levels in HFRS are associated with the disease stage and severity.",

However, clinically, the disease is almost recovered at this phase. Evidence shows that FasL-induced murine pulmonary inflammation is reduced by the intravenous pretreatment of a DcR3 analog [24], supporting a protective role of DcR3 in inflammation process. Hence, during the convalescent phase, DcR3 may participate in improving the repair of serious capillary permeability and kidney injury. High DcR3 expression during the convalescent phase may act as a feed-back mechanism in an anti-inflammatory response. Moreover, in the critical group, more DcR3 is required to work. It is conceivable that the decline and disappearance of DcR3 from serum could be regarded as the timescale of the disease.",

Moreover, the levels of serum DcR3 levels in HFRS patients are positively correlated with the levels of BUN, Cr and Proteinuria, which possibly reflect kidney function. Hence, high levels of DcR3 may reflect the status of kidney damage by HTNV infection. Clinically, the course of HFRS is highly variable, ranging from asymptomatic to a lethal outcome. Moreover, there are overlaps among the different phases and groups, which cause difficulties to clinicians for correct staging and typing of HFRS [2\u20134]. This study indicates that DcR3 may be a biomarker for patients with HFRS. First, DcR3 is closely related to the disease stage, severity and kidney injury. Moreover, DcR3 levels can be measured in accessible specimen (peripheral blood samples) by commercially available ELISA kits. Therefore, they have potential clinical application, and may well complement subjective judgments in diagnosis.",
