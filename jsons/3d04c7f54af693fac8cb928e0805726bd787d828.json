Methods: A Computer-Aided Diagnostic model for the acceptable and non-invasive prediction of CAD using the State Space Advanced FCM (AFCM) approach is proposed. Also, a rule-based mechanism is incorporated, to further increase the knowledge of the system and the interpretability of the decision mechanism. The proposed method is tested utilizing a CAD dataset from the Laboratory of Nuclear Medicine of the University of Patras. More specifically, two architectures of AFCMs are designed, and different parameter testing is performed. Furthermore, the proposed AFCMs, which are based on the new equations proposed recently, are compared with the traditional FCM approach. Results: The experiments highlight the effectiveness of the AFCM approach and the new equations over the traditional approach, which obtained an accuracy of 78.21%, achieving an increase of seven percent (+7%) on the classification task, and obtaining 85.47% accuracy. Conclusions: It is demonstrated that the AFCM approach in developing Fuzzy Cognitive Maps outperforms the conventional approach, while it constitutes a reliable method for the diagnosis of Coronary Artery Disease. Conclusions and future research related to recent pandemic of coronavirus are provided.",

Designing AFCM models requires the collaboration between experts and engineers. The experts suggest and aid for the designment of the AFCM, for it to be user-friendly, scientifically acceptable, and interpretable. In this work, the Nuclear Medicine staff suggested that the casual relationships between concepts were unable to explain some unique and complex connections. Hence, the proposed models were designed to function with the aid of some universal rules. The Rule-Embedded AFCM (RE-AFCM), which is proposed in this work, is evaluated on a real patient-candidate database from the Laboratory of Nuclear Medicine of the University of Patras. Aiming to improve and evaluate AFCM's performance, we experiment with the new and traditional equations, as well as with different activation functions, and architectures. The optimal parameters are defined through the experiments and correspond to an improvement in the accuracy by +7%, over the traditional approach. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the newly emerged State Space approach for the development of FCMs. It is also demonstrated that RE-AFCM can be applied to medical problems, with the appropriate modifications and with respect to the nature of the inputs.",

FCMs consist of a graphical representation through a signed directed graph, which includes feedback consisting of nodes and weighted arcs [12] . Each node in the graph represents a concept used to describe the cause and effect relationship. The nodes are connected by weighted arcs representing the actual interconnections. Each concept Ci (i.e., the variable of the system) is characterized by a number representing its values, and is calculated through the transformation of a fuzzy value, or the fitting of a numeric value, to the desired interval [0,1]. The initial weight values are defined by the experts of the domain and, therefore, they are linguistic variables, or rule-type statements. Through a defuzzification procedure the linguistic variables are transformed into numeric weights. In this way, FCMs embody the accumulated knowledge and experience from experts [13] . An example is given in Figure 1 . The degree of influence between the two concepts is indicated by the absolute value of Wij. During the simulation, the value of each concept (Ci) is calculated as shown in [14] .",

The relationships between the concepts of the system are described by the doctors in a linguistic way, thus allowing freedom to explain the interconnections the way experts prefer. The rest of the procedure, i.e., the defuzzification of the inputs and weights, is performed by the engineers. We can summarize the steps of the process as follows: (a) the experts decide the inputs of the system and their possible values, (b) each expert assigns a specific verbal weight between the concepts he/she believes that share a connection, (c) the doctors specify the specific rules describing the system and provide the necessary documentation that confirms the rules, (d) the doctors in collaboration with the engineers define the state concepts of the system, (e) the input values, the state and the weight values as well as the rules are transformed from nominal to numeric or binary form, following specific mathematical expressions, and (f) the numeric value of the output is calculated.

The overall accuracy is 85.47%. An overview of the RE-AFCM (case 9) is depicted in Figure 3 . In this section we compare the results of the proposed system with state-of-the-art classification algorithms. The crossvalidation was chosen to be 5-fold due to the small amount of training data. The Neural Network contains three depth layers of 1024, 512, and 256 nodes. Training was performed for 120 epochs, with a batch size of 32 and an initial learning rate of 0.01. Other Neural Networks with alterations on the prementioned parameters were tested and excluded due to inefficiency. Hence, the Neural Network we pick is the one with the better accuracy over all. The Support Vector Machine (SMO) has the following parameters: Complexity Parameter (c) is set at 1.0, the value of epsilon is set at 1E-12, the batch size is 32 and the calibrator method is tuned to Logistic. AdaBoostM1 meta classifier is trained for 50 iterations, with a batch size of 32 and the decision classifier Decision Stump is selected. Chirp is trained with a batch size of 32. Random Forest was trained for 100 iterations with a bag size of 20%, and batch size 32. Spaarc was trained with a batch size of 32. The rest of the classifiers were trained with the optimal parameters suggested by MATLAB Machine Learning Toolkit. The results demonstrate that the proposed model, outperforms every Machine Learning classifier which was employed for the classification task in this work.

Medical decision-making problems are difficult, complex and have attracted many research studies. As a result, a good number of Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) have been developed based on different methodologies. The majority of them are based on statistical approaches. Indeed all mathematical models been used in confronting the recent epidemic of Coronavirus are using statistical models. However all medical problems are non-linear and statistical models are based on the assumption that variables have linear correlation between them. All medical problems are dynamic and non-linear. Moreover physicians are requested to handle information of different nature, e.g. patient's history, clinical diagnostic tests, medical images, personal health problems and demographic characteristics. The interpretation of these results involve ambiguity and uncertainty, which plays a critical role for the decision-making to a wide and diverse set of medical problems. Therefore, new advanced scientific approaches and new mathematical models are needed. The challenge to physicians, engineers and decision makers is great and very important. The humankind, expects not to say it demands, serious answers from them.",

The presence of state vectors, helped clustering concepts of similar nature, rather than directly affecting the output in a static way. With the addition of rules, the system managed to explain more complex relations between the concepts; relations that often are conflicting with each other. This approach will be referred as the Advanced Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (AFCM) methodology. The results of this study show that the new state space AFCM achieve a slight better performance over the traditional FCM methodology namely: an increase of seven percent (+7%) on the classification task, and obtaining 85.47% accuracy a slight higher than the 78.21% of the traditional approach. Therefore, we can conclude that the AFCMs' decision-making mechanism is a unique and promising method of handling the parameters of a difficult medical problem.",
