Genomic structures and phylogenetic relationship reveals that subfamily Coronavirinae contains the four genera alpha coronavirus and betacoronavirus which are restricted to mammals and responsible for respiratory illness in humans such as Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (Cui et al. 2019; Kumar et al. 2020; Payne 2017; Phan et al. 2018) . The other two genera gamma coronavirus and delta coronavirus infect both birds and mammals (Cui et al. 2019; Kumar et al. 2020; Payne 2017; Phan et al. 2018 ). SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV show severe respiratory diseases in humans, and four others (HCoV-NL63, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, and HKU1) cause normal upper respiratory illness in the hosts which are immunocompetent, even though some can induce severe infections in elders, young children, and infants (Cui et al. 2019; Cascella et al. 2020) . Alpha and betacoronaviruses can give rise to intense burden on animals; these include recently emerged swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV) and the porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus and porcine enteric diarrhea virus (PEDV) (Cui et al. 2019; Banerjee et al. 2019) .",

The genome of coronaviruses contains open reading frames (ORFs) of variable number (6-11). In the first ORF, two thirds of the total viral RNA are located. Upon infection, two large precursor polyproteins, namely pp1a and pp1ab, has been translated by viral genome in the host cells. These translated precursor polyproteins get processed into 16 mature nonstructural proteins (nsp1-nsp16) by viral proteinases. These nonstructural proteins have been numbered according to the position from N to C terminus (Kumar et al. 2020; Narayanan et al. 2014 ). Figure 13 .3 depicts the structure of coronavirus representing essential proteins, accessory proteins, and nsp1-16. The remaining ORFs encode accessory proteins. The remaining part of viral genome encodes spike (S) glycoprotein, small envelope (E) protein, matrix (M) protein, and nucleocapsid protein (N). All these four are essential structural proteins. S protein is attached to the host receptor ACE2, including two subunits S1 and S2. The cellular tropism by RBD and virus host range is determined by S1. Virus cell membrane fusion is determined by S2 Pradhan et al. 2020; Belouzard et al. 2009; Du et al. 2009 ). Transmembrane nutrient transport and formation of envelop were performed by M protein. N protein and E protein along with several accessory proteins obstruct with host immune response Pradhan et al. 2020 ). The nonstructural proteins play a vital function at the time of viral RNA replication and transcription (Kumar et al. 2020; Narayanan et al. 2014) .

Cross-species transmission in RNA viruses is the most common approach to get entered into a new host. The process of recombination assists the entry of viruses as it facilitates viruses to explore a larger proportion of the sequence area, than mutation. This increases the probability of finding a genetic configuration that assists host adaptation (Loriere and Holmes 2012) . Both replicative and non-replicative recombination mechanism works for the viruses. In replicative recombination, the major role is played by viral polymerase; however, other viral or cellular proteins may exist.

SARS-CoV is becoming pandemic which is declared as public health emergency of global concern. The presence of novel glycosylation sites in SARS-CoV-2 makes it possible to become pandemic due to its antigenic divergence. At this time, it is important to understand and educate the mass to follow the instructions given by the authorities and avoid any social gathering. By this at least we can delay the transmission in widespread community. Slowdown of transmission rate will provide time to the researchers and scientists to prepare well and develop vaccine and treatment for this novel coronavirus. The similarity of SARS-CoV-2 to SARS-CoV in terms of antigenic sites proposes the scope of SARS-linked peptide-based vaccine to prevent COVID-19. The structural similarity of SARS-CoV-2 to SARS-CoV suggests the use of attachment inhibitor, specific to coronavirus as the current option of the treatment. Although the mechanism of species to species transfer of the SARS coronavirus is difficult to understand, SARS-CoV 2003 epidemic makes it clear that animal coronaviruses are budding threats to the human community. Still researches are going on COVID-19. Limited information on novel coronavirus makes some boundaries to explain the complete antigenicity and structure of COVID-19.",
