Injury resolution is an active process [4]. However, the mechanisms involved in the resolution of inflammation, avoidance of irreversible fibrosis, and reconstitution of alveolar endothelium and epithelium are still poorly understood.

Tregs can suppress inflammatory [6], allergic, and autoimmune disorders [7] as well as inflammation in pulmonary aspergillosis [8] or pneumocystis pneumonia [9]; therefore, Tregs might participate in ARDS and/or its resolution. In mice with lung injury induced by intratracheal lipopolysaccharide (LPS), resolution was influenced by the presence or absence of Tregs [5]. While depletion of Tregs in wild-type mice delayed recovery from lung injury and lymphocyte-deficient recombinase activating gene\u20131\u2013null (Rag-1\u2013/\u2013) mice [10] showed impaired resolution, this could be compensated for by intratracheal administration of isolated Tregs. Since the ratio of effector cells and suppressor cells maintains the response of the immune system [11], endogenous Tregs and the ratio of CD4 + CD25 + Foxp3 + T-regulatory cells (Tregs) to all (CD4+) lymphocytes might play an important role in lung injury and repair in humans. However, no data are available on the alveolar presence of Tregs in human ARDS or their course over time.",

First recognized for their ability to suppress autoimmunity, T-regulatory cells mediate effector CD4+ and CD8+ T-lymphocytes and impact on the innate immune system by several mechanisms like cell-to-cell contact, secretion of inhibitory cytokines, and cytolysis [16]. However, the suppressive function of T-regulatory cells might also contribute to the immune dysfunction often seen in later stages of sepsis or ARDS. This in turn may promote repetitive nosocomial infections and could contribute to insufficient lung repair and fibrosis. This speculation is supported by the correlation of the concentration of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL10 with the ratio of Tregs to all CD4+ cells in the BAL of the ARDS patients. The fact that this ratio also correlates with the tumor necrosis factor alpha concentration in the BAL suggests that the level of the inflammatory stimulus also regulates the strength of the ensuing anti-inflammatory reaction and hence the ratio of Tregs to all CD4+ cells in the BAL. Thus, we speculate that the stronger the inflammatory reaction is, the greater the proliferation of the anti-inflammatory CD4 + CD25 + Foxp3 + T-regulatory lymphocytes cells, which promotes repetitive nosocomial infections and therefore increased mortality.",

In addition, depletion of Tregs in wild-type mice delayed recovery from lung injury. Also, in chronic infection models of mice with pulmonary aspergillosis [8] or pneumocystis pneumonia [9], an increase to 4 % of the ratio of Tregs to all CD4+ cells in the bronchoalveolar lavage improved pulmonary inflammation and lung injury and diminished reinfection.

Furthermore, enrolled patients represent a selected cohort of ARDS patients since only those with ARDS evoked by CAP were included. Thus, results may not be representative for ARDS of other origin. In addition, the fact that patients taken as controls suffered from solid tumors may be problematic and could have altered the ratios of Tregs to all CD4+ cells in some lung healthy controls. However, the controls were free of lung, cardiac, infectious, or allergic disease, and BAL for cell isolation was performed immediately following induction of anesthesia assuming that these BALs approximate the BAL of healthy subjects. Furthermore, using a control group with normal lungs may not take into account potential alveolar cell responses to mechanical stress independent of those resulting from CAP-evoked ARDS alone. On the other hand, mechanical ventilation in patients without pneumonia and/or ARDS is unlikely to evoke alveolar cell stress and damage unless deliberately ventilated with large tidal volumes.
