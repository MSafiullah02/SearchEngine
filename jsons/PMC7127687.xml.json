According to the sepsis guideline, initial antibiotics should be administered within 1 h after recognition of sepsis [25]. For patients with severe initial presentation, ED physicians may urge the initiation of IV antibiotics and blood cultures without adherence to the bacteremia score. Calculation of the bacteremia score takes > 1.5 h because the scoring system includes albumin and C-reactive protein results. This fact may be why the bacteremia score adherence group had mild presentations and lower Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI) scores (Supplementary Table 1). For patients with mild symptoms and stable initial vital signs, ED physicians may wait for the laboratory tests before the initiation of IV antibiotics. Those patients may be stratified into the low-risk group for bacteremia and could have more chances to avoid unnecessary blood cultures of low yield. Therefore, by the time a decision had to be made regarding initiating IV antibiotics without blood culture, > 90 min had already passed, and the time-saving effect of omitting blood cultures may have been diminished.",

Missing not at random (MNAR) which occupied a small fraction (116/4130; 2.8%) but not included in analysis, may have created a bias. Also there could be many confounders influencing the results besides the intervention. Second, the baseline characteristics of the two groups before and after intervention were significantly different. The Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) outbreak in 2015 may have increased the sensitivity of the ED visit population to respiratory symptoms, which may be one of the reasons accounting for the difference [26]. Third, the adherence rate for the bacteremia score was 36.5% which may be too low to expect clinical and statistical significance. Generally, evidence-based changes in the clinical practice of physicians take a substantial amount of time and effort [27], [28]. In addition to those periods of adaptation, the time needed for calculation of the score make a decrease of adherence inevitable in severe patients for whom blood cultures and IV antibiotics were urgent. Additionally, the calculation of the score with multiplication and addition is difficult and the use of Excel file could be another cumbersome step to emergency physicians in a crowded ED. Finally the target population only included patients with CAP and this would limit the broad application of the rule in the clinical field. Despite those limitations, we could observed a statistically significant reduction in blood cultures after intervention without affecting 30-day mortality as well as decreasing trends in the initial antibiotics administration time and ED length of stay. Considering the low adherence rate to the score system, a more thorough education and feedback is needed to achieve statistically significant clinical impacts on the time of initial antibiotics administration and ED length of stay.",
