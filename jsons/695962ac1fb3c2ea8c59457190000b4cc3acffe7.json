We used a direct, unsupervised approach to compare the entire viral genomes, i.e. principle components analysis based on Jaccard similarity matrices. We did not include information about the geographic origin of the samples in the analysis nor did we attempt to directly model the evolutionary relationship of the different SARS-CoV-2 genomes, e.g. via phylogenetic analysis. Nevertheless, our analysis results reflect clearly the chronological spread of SARS-CoV-2 around the globe. The advantages of our methodology compared to existing network analyses are twofold: First, our unsupervised approach is capable of recovering geographic subgroups and geographic progression without any (spacial) information, and it takes all loci into account simultaneously. Second, it is particularly simple as it only involves the Hamming matrix and its Jaccard representation, both of which can be efficiently computed using binary operations only (Hahn et al., 2020a) .",

It is the subject of ongoing research to understand whether the four genetic subgroups of the SARS-CoV-2 viruses have different clinical implications in terms of disease progression and disease outcome. Furthermore, our results suggest that vaccine creation will have to take into account the genetic variability in viral sequence described here. As the virus has spread over time, its genetic diversity has increased and is likely to increase even further. To combat the virus successfully, it will be fundamental to understand the consequences of this development on the features of the virus.",
