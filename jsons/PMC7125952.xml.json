To allow passengers to survive and operate in this environment, the cabin must be pressurized. Despite pressurization, the internal cabin altitude is generally not maintained at sea level pressure because the aircraft structure required to maintain a sea level pressure would make the plane unacceptably heavy and expensive to build and operate. Thus, a compromise is made that is the most efficient for weight/strength/expense, while preventing passengers from becoming hypoxic. The aircraft cabin is typically pressurized between 6000 and 8000 feet above sea level. Newer aircraft, such as the Airbus A380 and Boeing 787 Dreamliner, can pressurize the cabin to lower altitudes, equal to about 6000 feet, even in the upper flight levels. In the United States, Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) requirements allow a maximum cabin altitude of 8000 feet.",

The fractional oxygen content of the air in the cabin is the same as that at sea level, approximately 21%. What changes with increasing cabin altitude is the atmospheric pressure. At a typical cruising altitude, the atmospheric pressure in the cabin is decreased by about 25% to 30% and results in a similar decrease in the partial pressure of inspired oxygen. The lower partial pressure of oxygen in the aircraft cabin results in slight hypoxemia, with a corresponding decrease in oxygen saturation and a mild compensatory hyperventilation and tachycardia. Medical personnel responding to onboard medical events should not be surprised by decreases in arterial oxygen saturation in the range of 3% to 5%, even in healthy individuals.",

If one considers the 20 to 30 minutes required for an emergency landing from cruising altitude, plus a 10-minute taxi time to the gate, it is clear that in the past, these patients rarely survived.\u2022The successful introduction of AEDs for use by personal outside of hospitals has resulted in vastly improved ventricular fibrillation survival rates.36 These data have prompted many international airline organizations to introduce AEDs into their aircraft fleet.\u2022The FAA made it mandatory for all US-based commercial passenger aircraft with at least one flight attendant to carry on AEDs since 2001.37\n\u2022If an AED is on board, typically at least one cabin crew member will be trained in its use. Airline protocol requires a crewmember to manage the AED and assist or direct its use.\u2022If cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) is indicated, begin CPR and ask the cabin crew to assist. One can expect that all cabin crew have been trained in basic CPR.\u2022Some on-board AEDs include an electrocardiographic display (monitor) that shows the cardiac rhythm. AEDs with monitoring capability are clinically useful because they allow better decision making when a passenger presents with chest pain, palpitations, dyspnea, or lightheadedness.27, 38\n\u2022For monitoring only, a new device, the Tempus IC (Remote Diagnostic Technologies, Hampshire, United Kingdom), may be used by people with little or no medical training. It can monitor blood pressure, tympanic temperature, glucometry, oxygen saturation as measured by pulse oximetry, respiration and breath gas analysis, and electrocardiogram, and transmit these data to a remote physician for diagnosis.39 It is being adopted by a few airlines at this time.\u2022A compact smart phone transducer, Kardia (AliveCor), is now available. The device allows monitoring of electrocardiogram when used in conjunction with a smart phone. Kardia\u2019s single lead electrocardiogram is comparable with Lead 1 of a standard electrocardiogram machines.40\n\n",

Maintaining a calm, competent, and professional demeanor can go a long way toward creating a less stressful environment for the patient, crew, and other airline passengers.\u2022Medical professionals should respond to a call only if they are a licensed, currently practicing medical provider.\u2022Be prepared to show a form of professional identification (eg, a medical license) that verifies your training.\u2022Do not respond if you have been drinking alcohol. If you have been drinking (eg, one drink) and no other provider responds, be sure to offer full disclosure to the flight crew and the patient.\u2022It is appropriate to ask the patient for consent before commencing in-flight care if they are not altered. This is generally best done with a crewmember as witness.43\n\u2022Ask for one flight attendant to continue assisting throughout the in-flight emergency. This helps to maintain continuity and ensures that you have access to needed equipment and cockpit communications.\u2022If the passenger seems to be severely ill, request ground-based consultation. On all US carriers and most international carriers you will have access to a ground-based consultant that greatly eases the pressure on any in-flight medical volunteer.\u2022You may legally speak to the flight crew about the medical issues.29 The airline is not required to follow federal regulations regarding health care privacy, because airlines are not considered to be a covered entity as defined by HIPAA.\u2022History taking may be difficult because of language barriers. Family members or another available passenger may act as an interpreter. The flight crew may not offer this, and it may be up to you to request this via a simple cabin announcement.\u2022Obtain and record vital signs early in the event.\u2022Physical examination can be extremely limited because of limitations in space, vibration, and ambient cabin noise. Auscultation of the heart, lungs, or abdomen may be virtually impossible.\u2022Better conditions for the evaluation and care of a passenger may necessitate moving the patient to an open area, such as an aft galley. If a full resuscitation is indicated, such as bag mask ventilation or AED defibrillation, this can only be done with the patient moved to a larger area. Treating a patient in the aisle should be avoided when possible because it impedes normal flight crew operations.\u2022You may be able to find additional medical equipment from other passengers. For example, in the case of a suspected hypoglycemic or hyperglycemic emergency, ask the flight attendant to announce that you are in need of a glucometer, which a passenger with diabetes might have on board.\u2022Do not be afraid to request additional help. A common example might be a physician out of practice starting IV lines requesting an announcement for a nurse or emergency medical technician with IV skills. You should be ready to defer to other providers who may have more experience delivering care in acute situations (ie, an office-based dermatologist deferring to an emergency physician).\u2022Do not to perform procedures that you are unfamiliar with.\u2022If the patient\u2019s presentation suggests a communicable disease, be sure to notify the cabin and/or flight crew.\u2022If you are presented with a \u201cDo Not Resuscitate\u201d order by an accompanying family member or friend, you need to make a decision on how to proceed. The cabin crew may decide to continue resuscitation if their company policy requires it, despite the Do Not Resuscitate order.13\n\n",
