The importance of bats as reservoirs of zoonotic viruses can be characterized by the feature that bats often permit persistent infection of highly pathogenic viruses without presenting symptoms.

Animals were sacrificed at 2 weeks after the last infection and sera were separated. WB analysis against HA-tagged recombinant viral proteins expressed in 293T cells was performed.

The mechanisms underlying different susceptibilities to these viruses have been considered to be due to the different immune responses or presence of virus binding receptors. Although there was no evidence to explain the highest susceptibility of C3H mice to PRV infection, further analysis regarding the different susceptibilities among the mouse strains (i.e., C3H vs ICR, Balb/c, C57BL/6) would help to understand the molecular mechanisms of PRV pathogenicity, in particular how the genetic background of the host influences the outcome of PRV replication and pathogenesis. It should be noted that only young (4-week-old) male mice were included in this study, although PRV was detected exclusively in adult patients (26-54 years old) (Cheng et al., 2009; Chua et al., 2007 Chua et al., , 2008 Chua et al., , 2011 Wong et al., 2012; Yamanaka et al., 2014) . Further, it should be noted that 4-week-old mice are not immunologically mature (Jackson et al., 2017) . To explore the association between the mouse model and natural infection, further studies are required employing female mice or mice of a wider age range. No sign of cell-cell fusion in infected lung tissues was observed. These results suggest that PRV strain MB does not induce syncytium formation in vivo, or that the disruption of damaged cells makes it difficult to identify cell-cell fusion in the targeted tissues. Using C3H mice sera infected with PRV, serological examination was conducted to investigate whether PRV antibodies contribute to protection against genetically related Reoviridae viruses including ARV, MRV, and RV. The results of NT tests demonstrated that PRV are serologically independent from these viruses. Although ARV-, MRV-, and RV-specific antisera were not tested, investigation regarding whether PRV infection was cross-neutralized by antibodies to other Reoviridae viruses would help to understand the epidemiology of PRV. Furthermore, the significant difference in the NT assay results of PRV between A549 and L929 cells could be explained by the different usage of viral ligands for cell attachment during PRV infection. We have recently demonstrated that PRV utilizes the virus structural protein \u03c3C for entry into A549 but not L929 cells (Kawagishi et al., 2016) . In the NT assay using A549 cells, antibodies against \u03c3C in serum from mice infected with PRV worked effectively as a neutralizing antibody but not in L929 cells. As shown in Figs. 4 and 5, \u03c3C comprises one of the major viral proteins that induce specific antibodies. It was thus reasonable that a high amount of neutralizing antibody against \u03c3C in infected mice sera caused high NT activity in A549 cells and it could be concluded that A549 cells could therefore be recommended for NT assays in seroepidemiological studies of PRV.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 549, "end": 573, "text": "(Neighbour et al., 1978;", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 574, "end": 596, "text": "Niewiesk et al., 1993;", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 597, "end": 617, "text": "Parker et al., 1978)", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 712, "end": 737, "text": "(Allan and Shellam, 1984;", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 738, "end": 761, "text": "Bang and Warwick, 1960)", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1502, "end": 1522, "text": "(Cheng et al., 2009;", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1523, "end": 1540, "text": "Chua et al., 2007", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 1541, "end": 1560, "text": "Chua et al., , 2008", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1561, "end": 1580, "text": "Chua et al., , 2011", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1581, "end": 1599, "text": "Wong et al., 2012;", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 1600, "end": 1622, "text": "Yamanaka et al., 2014)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1705, "end": 1727, "text": "(Jackson et al., 2017)", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 3004, "end": 3028, "text": "(Kawagishi et al., 2016)", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 115, "end": 123, "text": "(Fig. 1)", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In comparison, there were significant differences in the reactivity of C3H serum against viral proteins between FFA and WB assays.

In the present study, mouse serum reacted to \u03bbC and \u03c3A at quite high titer in the FFA assay but was not reactive in the WB assay, which probably occurred because the antibodies likely recognize only the conformational epitope but not the linear epitope. In FFA and WB assays, a fairly strong reaction was observed to the \u03c3C protein. As \u03c3C, which is located at the surface of the virion, functions as a cell-attaching viral protein, it is reasonable that antibodies were induced to this protein. \u03c3C is known to be highly variable between PRV isolates, probably because neutralizing antibody pressure might drive the rapid mutation of this protein. Owing to the high variation in \u03c3C sequences, \u03c3C may therefore not represent an appropriate target for sero-epidemiological studies for a broad range of PRV strains but may instead be suitable for detecting specific virus strains.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "In contrast, the other viral proteins that induced specific antibodies, including six structural proteins (\u03bbC, \u03bbA, \u03bcB, \u03c3C, \u03c3A, and \u03c3B) and two non-structural proteins (\u03bcNS and \u03c3NS) are relatively conserved between the PRV isolates reported to date. Notably, although it was anticipated that antibodies were raised preferentially to outer proteins that could readily be exposed to immune cells, the antibodies to the two NS proteins were not expected. \u03bcNS and \u03c3NS of PRV likely generate viral inclusion bodies (VIBs) during the replication cycle as a common structure in family Reoviridae, although the functions of these proteins are not yet defined. VIBs are a site of virion assembly, which are usually found exclusively in the cytoplasm and not spontaneously released to outside cells. Conversely, our results suggest that VIBs are released outside the cell probably by the disruption of PRV-infected cells. There have been no reports regarding NT activity of antibodies against VIB. Thus, the six structural and two NS proteins constitute candidate viral proteins for sero-epidemiological studies. Especially, \u03bbA, \u03bcB, \u03bcNS, and \u03c3NS, which were positive both in FFA and WB assays, are recommended as primary choices for target antigens, although differences in the properties of antibody recognition between host species must be considered (i.e., human patients may develop antibodies to different viral proteins than those recognized in the mouse infection model). In WB analysis, there were discrepancies in the band patterns of \u03bbA and \u03c3C as revealed by anti-PRV serum and anti-HA antibody. These results indicate that anti-PRV serum recognizes particular sites on each viral protein.
