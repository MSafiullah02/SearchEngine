Zika is transmitted by the common mosquito vector, Aedes species. In 2015, the international spread of Zika infection attracted global attention, when a marked increase in microcephaly cases in Brazil was linked to an epidemic of Zika infection [3].",

Therefore, it is important for governments and health workers to assess the public\u2019s knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) toward Zika. Traditionally, paper-based questionnaires have been used for research such as this. However, these take time, energy, and resources to administer. As public access increases, the Internet offers an unprecedented opportunity to conduct rapid assessments of community KAP related to emerging new diseases. Internet-based investigations are cost-effective, have rapid data collection, and the data can easily be transferred to statistical software for analysis. Some traditional paper-based investigations have already been superseded by Internet-based ones [9,10]. A disadvantage of Internet-based investigations is that data collected online may not be representative of the general population. However, data collected in the paper-based investigation may not be representative either. Web-based surveys are considered more feasible for large population-based cross-sectional studies [11].",

(3) If pregnant women contract Zika, what is the adverse outcome? and (4) Where are mosquitoes extremely common? Questions about attitudes to Zika were (1) Do you worry about contracting Zika? and (2) How do you think your body will be harmed if you contract Zika? Questions about practices related to Zika were (1) Do you use strategies to prevent mosquito bites at home? and (2) Do you actively seek information regarding Zika? Questions about Zika were based on the latest official report of World Health Organization and literature.

Then, one community was randomly selected from each of these districts. Families in the chosen communities were numbered and again chosen randomly. Finally, the randomly selected family members were informed about the study by a leaflet that contained the same information provided online and were invited to complete the questionnaire. Contact with potential participants was made by local health center professionals conducting a home visit. For each questionnaire, an investigator received 25 RMB and a respondent received a gift worth 20 RMB. We assumed that, overall, the level of those in the community with good knowledge about Zika would be about 50%, with 95% confidence in the estimate, precision of 5%, and 20% of nonresponse rate.

Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted to explore the association between sociodemographic variables and KAP variables. Items of KAP were analyzed separately. We dummy-coded categorical variables. Participants who were able to correctly answer the knowledge-based questions about transmission of Zika, main at-risk population, adverse outcomes of Zika during pregnancy, and where mosquitoes were extremely common were coded into the high-KAP category; all others were coded into the low-KAP category. Participants who were not at all worried about contracting Zika were coded into one category; the remainder were coded into another category. Those who replied that contracting Zika could cause serious harm were coded into one category; all others were coded into another category.

            "text": "Our study provides valuable insights into KAP related to Zika among people in the southern part of China. The Internet-based survey had a larger proportion of participants with a basic knowledge regarding Zika, and they tended to seek information on Zika more actively and be less worried about contracting Zika than participants in the paper-based survey. Although, the Internet-based survey involved fewer resources and was much faster than the paper-based survey in the community, if only an Internet-based survey were used to carry out an emergency assessment of health education needs, you would need to be cautious about the generalizability of the results. Finally, our study suggests that in the outbreak of a new infectious disease, as well as providing health information on the Internet, the government and health workers should also ensure adequate access to health information for older and less educated people in the community to achieve greater equity in health.",
