Maintaining distance from loved ones to avoid causing them harm can be damaging to the mental health of trainees. This distancing also eliminates an important outlet for stress relief.

These may include wellness coaches, counselors, and virtual program leadership meetings. A coverage system may be devised, using fellows who were scheduled to be on research or endoscopy rotations, to ensure that clinical duties do not inhibit the pursuit of mental health resources. Additionally, volunteer programs can be designed to assist trainees in need of pet care, babysitting, transportation, and groceries. Fellows who are home, sheltering in place, can help with some of these needs for other fellows. Further, hospital and departmental communication should focus on fostering a supportive environment, with ongoing support of mental health resources.",

It is important to keep in mind that endoscopy is both a cognitive and technical discipline. This unfortunate circumstance provides the opportunity to develop the cognitive aspect of endoscopy in ways that may not have otherwise arisen. We are involved in real-time decisions on the urgency and necessity of endoscopic procedures we once routinely performed. The exercise of choosing which procedures offer high enough yield and benefit to patients in the immediate setting to outweigh the risk of exposure and the use of limited PPE is a valuable one.

By learning from our past experiences, we can mitigate the negative impact on medical education and implement programs faster than before.2 We suggest that gastroenterology programs use virtual platforms for board review and conferences, continue with journal clubs with the help of social media, and encourage the use of didactic videos for endoscopic procedures.

It is also interesting to note that during the SARS outbreak in Toronto in 2003, limited social media platforms were available and not used as commonly. With the advent of Twitter, for example, we can participate in a journal club with leaders in the field of gastroenterology from around the nation and globe. Through VideoGIE and YouTube, we can watch endoscopy cases and discuss them in the comments section.

This avenue, however, has inherent limitations such as suboptimal or absent audience interaction, lack of widespread interest, and inability to participate in hands-on workshops. Another medium to facilitate virtual research dissemination is through social media; however, this is not universally used and would present a new logistical challenge. This may be surmounted through dissemination of tutorials on appropriate use of social media. If a virtual conference can be effectively done, this may provide an interactive option to use for years to come for those unable to attend the conference.
