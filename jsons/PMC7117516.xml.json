PEDV is antigenically unrelated to other porcine coronaviruses like gastroenteritis transmissible virus and hemaglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (Kusanagi et al., 1992). PEDV is highly infectious and transmission is primarily through pig-to-pig contact or indirect contact with fecal material from infected pigs.",

PED has also been documented in South-East Asia since the 1980s (Song and Park, 2012). However, variant strains of PEDV causing severe outbreaks of disease in suckling pigs with high morbidity and mortality appeared in 2010 in China (Li et al., 2012). Furthermore, and since April 2013, very similar PEDV strains to the Chinese variants have been detected in North America resulting in significant pig mortality and economic loss (Huang et al., 2013). Phylogenetic analyses suggested that the PEDV in the USA likely originated from China (Huang et al., 2013). Taking into account that the exact source of origin of the US strains has not been identified, the potential continued spread of the virus worldwide is a critical concern. Under this scenario, feed or feed ingredients, including spray-dried porcine plasma (SDPP), have recently been suggested as potential sources for transmission of PEDV (Pasick et al., 2014).",

The spray drying process used to manufacture SDP involves sudden changes in temperature and pressure that causes rapid evaporation of water which is detrimental to a variety of pathogens including bacteria and viruses (Polo et al., 2005, Polo et al., 2013). A series of studies have demonstrated that manufacturing conditions to produce commercial spray-dried porcine plasma (SDPP) inactivate several viruses of importance to the swine industry such as porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), pseudorabies virus (PRV) (Polo et al., 2005) or swine vesicular disease virus (SVD) (Pujols et al., 2007). In addition, several studies have reported that orally consumed commercial SDPP does not transmit either porcine parvovirus (PPV) or porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) (Polo et al., 2005, Pujols et al., 2008, Pujols et al., 2011, Shen et al., 2011), which are two of the most heat and chemically resistant swine viruses.",

This strain of PEDV is well known to propagate on VERO cells and was selected as a model swine coronavirus to study inactivation of PEDV by spray drying. PEDV was propagated in VERO cell line, grown in Eagle's Minimum Essential Medium (MEM), supplemented with 0.3% tryptose phosphate broth (Sigma), 10% fetal bovine serum and an antibiotic combination (penicillin 100 IU/mL, streptomycin 100 \u03bcg/mL). Virus stock was produced in VERO cells seeded in 175 cm2 flask to confluent monolayers, cells were rinsed 3 times with phosphate buffered saline and inoculated with 10 ml of PEDV 3.5 log10 TCID50/mL (MOI of 0.002) to each bottle. The virus-cells mixture was incubated 1 h at 37 \u00b0C, and then the inoculum was replaced with post-infection media (PM), which consisted of MEM supplemented with 0.3% tryptose phosphate broth (Sigma), 12.5 \u03bcg/mL trypsin (Sigma) and the above mentioned antibiotic combination (Hofmann and Wyler, 1989). Cultures were checked at 18 and 24 h after infection to assess syncytia formation and the evolution of cytopathogenic effect (CPE) until reaching nearly 100% CPE. Liquid supernatants and scraped cells were collected. The pooled suspensions were centrifuged at 1000 g for 20 min at 4 \u00b0C and supernatants were stored at 4 \u00b0C. The resulting pellet was suspended in PM and subjected to freeze-thaw, centrifuged and supernatants were harvested and added to bulk supernatants. Stock virus was stored at \u221280 \u00b0C or used immediately after its production (Hofmann and Wyler, 1989). A PEDV virus stock was produced to a virus titer ranging between 4.0 log10 and 5.0 log10 TCID50/mL (Hofmann and Wyler, 1989, Song et al., 2003, Oh et al., 2005).",

These results are in agreement with previous publications indicating that PEDV is a low thermal stable virus (Song and Park, 2012). In addition, these results agree with previous reports with different enveloped viruses like PRRSV and PRV (Polo et al., 2005) and a non-enveloped virus like SVD (Pujols et al., 2007). These studies demonstrated that the commercial spray drying conditions used for the manufacturing process of commercial SDP should be sufficient to eliminate low-medium heat resistant viruses like PEDV. The normal processing temperature condition used by commercial SDP manufacturing plants is >80 \u00b0C throughout its substance. The present data indicated that drying at 70 \u00b0C throughout its substance was already adequate to inactivate at least 5.15 log10 TCID50/g of this virus. Therefore, the heat treatment used during the commercial spray-drying process is theoretically more than adequate to inactivate PEDV if present in the raw material. Recent data would support such conclusion (Gerber et al., 2014, Opriessnig et al., 2014). In the first study, researchers used raw plasma from a non-infected pig spiked with wild type US strain of PEDV and either fed directly as raw liquid spiked plasma or spray-dried it (in a laboratory drier at 83 \u00b0C outlet temperature) and fed to na\u00efve pigs. Their results indicated that the raw liquid spiked plasma was infective but the spray dried spiked plasma was not infective, indicating that spray drying at outlet temperature around 80 \u00b0C should be enough to inactivate the PEDV (Gerber et al., 2014). In the second study, piglets received a diet with 5% SDPP containing 5.1 \u00b1 0.1 log10 PEDV RNA copies/g and showed no evidence of infectivity by the existing PEDV RNA present in the SDPP lot utilized (Opriessnig et al., 2014).",

However, virus concentration diminished considerably for the samples stored at 4 \u00b0C or 12 \u00b0C for 7 days compared to samples immediately stored frozen at \u221280 \u00b0C. Importantly, samples stored at room temperature did not contain infective PEDV by 7 days of storage, which is consistent with previous data reported by other researchers. They demonstrated that PEDV-positive feces spread evenly on the bottom surface aluminum tray and treated at 20 \u00b0C for 7 days were non infective when feed-back to na\u00efve pigs by oral-gastric tube (Thomas et al., 2014). Also, it is important to highlight that, even at 4 \u00b0C, the virus was not infectious in cell culture after 21 days of storage. The fact that spray dried blood products are powders with low moisture (below 8%) and water activity (<0.6) are important, since PEDV does not survive very long under dry conditions (OIE, 2014).",

These results indicated that qRT-PCR Ct values were not different between samples (p\n > 0.05), independently of the storage conditions. However, differences between days (p\n < 0.05) at each temperature condition should be indicative of progressive genome degradation. Moreover, the qRT-PCR positive results compared to those generated by cell culture of the virus indicated that the former technique is not a good indicator to establish PEDV infectivity. However, it is also true that virus isolation might not be highly sensitive; therefore, a swine bioassay would be the most definitive way to demonstrate the putative infectivity of those qRT-PCR positive samples which were negative after inoculation of VERO cells.",
