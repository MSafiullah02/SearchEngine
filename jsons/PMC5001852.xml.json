As of March, 2015 there have been approximately 1000 laboratory confirmed cases reported with a 36% case fatality rate (http://www.who.int/csr/disease/coronavirus_infections/). Considering the geographical location of MERS and the Hajj pilgrimage which draws an estimated 2.5 million visitors, roughly 1.8 million of whom travel internationally (http://www.cdsi.gov.sa/english/index.php?option=com_docman&Itemid=173) MERS-CoV represents a global health risk. Common signs and symptoms of MERS include fever, cough, shortness of breath, and myalgia. Gastrointestinal signs are also frequently observed which include vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain (Assiri et al., 2013). Often, MERS patients also have underlying comorbidities such as diabetes, hypertension, and chronic cardiac or renal disease (Assiri et al., 2013).",

Ideally, a laboratory animal model would demonstrate clinical signs consistent with all aspects of human disease. As with most infectious diseases, mice have been evaluated as a potential MERS model for pathogenesis and countermeasure screening. Balb/c and STAT-1 knockout mice did not develop signs of disease, such as weight loss, nor could infectious virus be recovered from lung homogenates (Coleman et al., 2014). Zhao et al. developed a murine model for MERS by transduction of the respiratory tract with the putative MERS-CoV receptor, human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4 or CD26), using an adenovirus construct (Zhao et al., 2014). Infected mice developed limited clinical signs including a small degree of weight loss. Histopathological analysis found peribronchial and perivascular lymphoid infiltrates which later progressed to an interstitial pneumonia. Nearly 6 log10 plaque forming units (PFU)/g of infectious virus could be detected in the lungs of infected DPP4 transduced mice (Zhao et al., 2014). The DPP4 transduced mouse model has been used to evaluate countermeasures and pathogenesis (Channappanavar et al., 2014a, Channappanavar et al., 2014b).",

            "text": "Nonhuman primate (NHP) models are considered to be essential to understanding pathogenesis and evaluating countermeasures. Results from several challenge studies of MERS-CoV in rhesus monkeys (Macaca Mulatta) have varied between laboratories. The first published NHP model used rhesus monkeys inoculated via multiple routes and evaluated for virological, immunological, and histopathological changes up to 6 days post-inoculation (de Wit et al., 2013). NHPs demonstrated signs of pneumonia and virus could be detected in tissues and mucous membranes by quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), but attempts to determine the load of infectious virus was not reported. A follow up study demonstrated that administration of interferon-alpha2b and ribavirin reduced viral burden and lessened disease (Falzarano et al., 2013). Results from a natural history study of MERS-CoV-infected rhesus monkeys indicated that intratracheal inoculation induced a non-lethal disease with limited pathology observed in recovering animals at 28 days post-inoculation and infectious virus could be recovered from lung but not other tissues assayed (Yao et al., 2014). Standard radiological examination revealed lung infiltrates at days 3 and 5 post-inoculation, suggesting virus-induced lung disease. More recently, Falzarano et al. described multiple route inoculation of the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) in which transcriptional changes indicating induction of immune, inflammatory, and repair pathways were cataloged and partial lethality was observed (Falzarano et al., 2014).",

We inoculated 4 groups of marmosets and followed disease progression by periodic physical exams that included computed tomography (CT). Previously, positron emission tomography with computed tomography (PET)/CT has been used to evaluate tuberculosis therapies in common marmosets (Via et al., 2013), disease progression in monkeypox-virus-inoculated cynomolgus monkeys (Dyall et al., 2011), and influenza-A-virus-inoculated ferrets (Jonsson et al., 2012). CT has two distinct advantages when compared to standard x-ray radiography 1) CT provides three dimensional data, and 2) CT data can be quantified, which allows unbiased comparisons (Elke et al., 2013, Li et al., 2013, Romanova et al., 2014).",

The quantitative assessment suggests that mock inoculated subjects developed a short lived response that was observed one day post-inoculation but returned to near baseline by the day 7 CT and remained near that volume throughout the course of the study. Subjects inoculated with inactivated virus demonstrated increased abnormal lung volumes when compared to the media only group, but not as elevated as the groups that received live virus. MERS-CoV inoculated groups demonstrated increasingly abnormal lung volumes beginning day 1 post-inoculation in an individual dependent manner that did not completely resolve by study end (Fig. 5C and D). Comparison of the mean peak values of diseased lung volume and percent relative change of abnormal lung volume for each group indicated no statistically significant difference (unpaired t-test) between the virus isolates (Fig. 5E and F). When the peak diseased lung volume of the infectious MERS-EMC receiving group is compared to the mock infected the p-value=0.026 and when compared to the \u03b3-irradiated virus receiving group it is p=0.548. Comparison of the MERS-JOR group to the control groups indicates a similar pattern p=0.057 and p=0.1245, respectively. Comparison of the % fold change in diseased lung volume between the MERS-EMC and mock group gave p=0.0049 and the \u03b3-irradiated virus receiving group was 0.0195. Comparison of the % fold change in diseased lung volume between the MERS-JOR and mock group gave p=0.2102 and p=0.1591. The data indicate that, in common marmosets, the genetic sequence differences between the isolates do not impact disease progression as indicated by changes in diseased lung volume and that the MERS virion itself can induce an inflammatory response. However, a significant difference was observed between the MERS-EMC group and the mock exposed group when compared by fold change of diseased lung volume, which likely reflects the small group sizes. Differences in temporal progression were observed between the individual subjects that did not segregate by virus isolate.",

Three notable differences between the present study and Falzarano et al. are 1) our use of control subjects receiving media or inactivated virus, 2) single IT route vs. multiple inoculation routes (oral, intranasal, ocular, and IT), and 3) the volume of lung inoculum (0.2 mL vs. 0.5 mL). Similar to their rhesus experiment, their marmoset experiment was designed as a serial euthanasia study. Six subjects were euthanized at early timepoints post-exposure, before the disease course could resolve. However, two subjects met moribund endpoint criteria on day 4, and 3 survived to day 20 post-inoculation. It is unknown what the true outcome of the subjects that were serially euthanized would have been and if the subjects that met endpoint criteria did so due to virus induced disease or subject manipulations, thus skewing the interpretation of disease severity. Adding to the difficulty in data interpretation, qRT-PCR data is not supported by immunohistochemistry, EM, or virus isolation. Furthermore, the pattern of infectious virus isolation shown by Falzarano et al. demonstrates that initially only the lungs contain infectious virus in 11/15 tissues (trachea and lung lobes) examined, by day 4 post-inoculation virus can be isolated from fewer lung lobes (8/10 tissues), but virus can be isolated from the trachea. By day 6 post-inoculation virus is detected in 1/8 of lung lobes and all tracheas examined. No quantification is provided, therefore it is difficult to determine if propagated infectious virus was recovered or merely the inoculum. Based on our data and Falzarano et al.\u05f3s data, it is possible that intratracheal inoculation results in mechanical damage to the respiratory epithelium, followed by inflammation and repair, which leads to restoration of mucociliary motion that clears the liquid (and virus) from the lung.",

All animal procedures were approved by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) Animal Care and Use Committee, and adhered to National Institutes of Health (NIH) policies. The experiments were carried out at the NIAID Integrated Research Facility, an AAALAC and AALAS accredited facility.",
