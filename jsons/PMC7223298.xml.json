Here is a brief review of the issues involved in using predictive toxicology in regulatory alternative analysis (AA). It is good practice to use case studies to integrate predictive toxicology with AA, to start with prioritization of chemicals of interest, and to leverage existing resources to integrate predictive toxicology into AA practices using existing resources. Incorporating predictive toxicity into AA will enhance the ability of workplaces and regulators to choose alternatives to hazardous components and further increase the use of toxicity prediction in regulation [5]. Computational toxicology, also known as \u201cin silico toxicology,\u201d is based on knowledge gained from various scientific disciplines, and its activity is known due to the premise that the toxicity of chemicals is predictable in the molecular structure, and can be inferred from the properties. In order to provide a faster, more economic, and animal-free tool for predicting the toxicity of analogous compounds, structure\u2013activity relationships (SARs) play an important role as the application of chemical genotoxicity and carcinogenicity assessments increases. The development of SAR algorithms is an ongoing process, and new models, as well as new versions of applications, are constantly being made available [6].",

To this end, the development of predictive toxicity assays and models has become a strategic problem for these companies, and an integrated approach to in vitro and in vivo experimental data and knowledge-based data sources should be undertaken [7]. As the size and diversity of biological data have increased over the decades, computerized predictions of toxicity have reached new levels. Emerging theories of machine learning for chemistry allow chemical structures, toxicology, simulation, and physical data to be integrated when predicting health risks and other toxicological information [8]. The developed in silico model has been fully validated and released online via the Enalos Cloud platform, which can be accessed at https://enalos.insilicotox.com/MouseTox/. This ready-to-use Web service provides free use of model results through a user-friendly interface, which can serve as a toxicity prediction tool for the risk assessment of new compounds, without special requirements or prior programming skills [9].",

It is considered to be one of the alternatives to animal testing, which, in broad terms, utilizes a variety of computational techniques that correlate the toxicity or efficacy of a chemical with its structure. Computational techniques make it possible to quantitatively and qualitatively predict the toxicity of chemicals, mixtures, nanomaterials, and so on. The methods have strengths and limitations, specifics of scope and interpretation, so it is important to find the most effective method for each problem. Chemicals are toxic by interacting with other substances, and risk assessments can overlook the side effects of the mixture. For example, although adding other metals together increases lead (Pb) toxicity and reports accumulative risk assessment, there is a lack of raw data on the toxicity of the mixture, due to chemical exposure types and complex interactions, and it is not possible to test all combinations of these elements [10].",

Efforts have been made to develop in silico models, such as computational tools that are efficient, fast, inexpensive, and accurate, and more than anything, that can be performed before the compound is synthesized [12]. In recent years, chemical toxicity prediction models have been developed in the field of chemical risk assessment, along with an admetSAR Web server with machine learning methods and structural alerts that have been developed for public use at no cost [13]. In order to model chemical carcinogenesis, several papers have shared protocols, and the authors have recently developed CarcinoPred-EL, a Web server that can predict carcinogenicity online [14]. More than 8000 compounds with Ames mutagens are currently known, and in recent years, these toxicity data have been used to extend predictive models and structural alerts [15]. Acute oral toxicity is the most widely studied in computational predictions, and several models were developed to predict acute oral toxicity. Several machine learning methods were developed and applied to construct classification and regression models to predict LD50 or its toxicity categories [16].",

The fundamental approach to developing, validating, and using QSAR models to predict toxicity is medium consistency. Since mathematical models are used to develop the equations, the quantification of various properties of the molecular set is also easily performed. These models work with new technologies to build models related to structure, activity, and toxicity.

A linear QSNR model has been provided to predict EC50 (effective concentration for 50% enzymatic inhibition) for silver nanoparticles from size and surface charge, and a QSNR model using a quantum chemical descriptor is a fullerene C60 derivative. Integrating high-throughput screening methods with biosafety and in silico modeling emphasizes a system biology approach that ensures quality in nanosafety research, bridges the mechanical gap in fundamental research, and makes recommendations for predictive biological responses in nanotoxicology. In particular, \u201cnano-QSAR\u201d should be systematic and standardized as information collected in consideration of nano-characteristics. When developing toxicity prediction models, system interactions should be considered, and the EU NanoPUZZLES project was one of the global collaborations that improved the data availability and modeling approach to support the evaluation of nanomaterials [25]. Strategic development that combines multiple alternative tests can be useful for NM risk assessment and can assist decision-making [26].",

Taking into account the reliability of the conditions, the first multitasking (mtk)-QSTR model was developed to simultaneously predict the acute toxicity of a compound. The mtk-QSTR model can classify a compound\u2019s toxicity based on artificial neural networks (ANNs) and make predictions about various chemicals used in life and the workplace [34]. Toxic modeling has been a challenge for developers of QSAR models, due to the complexity of the endpoints; but recently, some new in silico methods have been developed that introduce the possibility of evaluating the integration of existing methods using various modeling perspectives. Model users should be aware of the considerations and assumptions made about these specific models as well as the assumptions made by evaluating the predictions on a case-by-case basis [35].",

The genotoxic impurities play a critical role in carcinogenesis, and impurities that affect pharmaceutical, safety, efficacy, and drug quality are attracting increasing interest in regulatory agencies and related industries [37]. Toxicity is defined as a series of events resulting from exposure to, and the distribution and metabolism of chemicals, and ultimately, interactions with other macromolecules in the cell, that is, interactions with DNA or proteins with various toxicity endpoints [38]. Mutagenicity is a major toxic endpoint for chemical risk assessment. The nature of a chemical that alters DNA or RNA sequences is mutagenicity, and these mutations can actually be fixed or transmitted [39]. DNA can be affected by ultraviolet light and by a variety of chemicals, such as industrial chemicals, pesticides, and the combustion by-products of fossil fuels [40]. The accurate identification of potentially toxic chemicals represents an important problem, and chemicals are proven to be mutagens mainly through battery experiments such as in vitro and in vivo. The electrophilic theory of Miller and Miller\u2019s chemical carcinogens suggests that most of the carcinogens are electrophilic or nucleic acids or proteins [41]. Further reacting with nucleophilic groups leads to the fact that electrophilic properties are common between mutations and carcinogens [42].",

However, the difficulty lies in selecting the most appropriate protocol to establish an example of this relationship and to highlight potential in vivo risks. With this in mind, a project has begun to assess the relevance of existing structural alerts for ex vivo chromosomal damage from expert system Derek Nexus to its in vivo activity, by assessing the predictability of in vivo chromosomal damage datasets. Detailed information related to the in vivo activities and protocols added to the alert along with the mechanism information provided is useful for directing further testing of the compound of interest [44].

This highlights the need for a reliable eye stimulation model that takes into account the mechanism of action and the individual structural classification, and the value of the profiling compound in relation to its chemical reactivity and physicochemical properties, which, together with the existing model, provide better prediction of severe stimulants [46]. Potential endocrine-disrupting chemicals present difficult regulatory challenges, and endocrine-disrupting chemicals can interfere with hormonal receptors associated with various health hazards. By integrating QSAR, docking, and systems biology approaches as virtual screening tools for use in risk assessment, systems biology pathways and network analysis approaches will provide a means to more critically assess the potential impact of endocrine-disrupting chemicals [47]. QSARs can contribute to the assessment of chemicals under REACH, where appropriate, and in some cases can be applied instead of experimental tests to fill in data gaps for information requirements. These results are similar to those of early QSAR and experimental studies of chemicals and show how high-throughput virtual screening can be used to identify potential genotoxic carcinogens, mutagens, and developmental toxins using QSAR predictions [48]. The US EPA Endocrine Disorder Screening Program (EDSP) uses in vitro data sourced from ToxCast/Tox21 high-throughput screening assays to evaluate the endocrine activity of chemicals. The QSAR model estimated more potent estrogen activity for most of the known estrogen metabolites compared to the parent chemical, and the method proposed in the in silico approach is an inexpensive and fast strategy for the detection of chemicals using estrogen metabolites [45]. A rapid test strategy for reproductive toxicity testing, avoiding the use of animals, combines knowledge of important processes affected by reproductive toxicants with the knowledge of the mechanical basis of those effects. As an additional step, examples were generated of how to predict the reproductive toxicity of chemicals using available data, formal validation of panel components was performed, and mechanical approaches used to test and verify, using more innovative approaches [49].",

For example, it has been found that the toxicity of lead (Pb) increases with the coadministration of other metals, and a \u201ccumulative risk assessment\u201d has been developed to evaluate the toxicity of mixtures.

In silico toxicity predictions continue to evolve through the introduction of new methods, and improvements to current methods. The future of chemical hazard assessment emphasizes the replacement of animal experiments with human-related assays in vitro or in silico, and intelligently combining and using information for toxicity assessment and decision-making through an increasing variety of alternative assays. Certainly, useful components in the process of evaluating in silico toxicology, and in the future, mathematical calculations, will be extended to include special new types of toxicology items and models for chemicals. Toxicity evaluation of chemicals is essential for workers\u2019 health and safety. Regulations for assessing the toxicity of genotoxic impurities lead to the integration of genotoxicity and carcinogenicity in vivo, and in vitro assays are becoming integrated with computational predictions [52]. One of the ICH M7 guidelines focuses on the identification of mutagens using in silico prediction, instead of in vitro studies [53]. Good prediction depends on two main factors: sensitivity and specificity. Sensitivity is the ability of a program to accurately identify true positive mutagens, which are chemicals that are likely to cause mutations, and specificity is the ability to identify true negative mutagens, such as safe chemicals that are not likely to be mutagenic [54]. In silico screening techniques can be applied to the toxicity assessment of chemicals, and the number of chemicals can be filtered by evaluating large libraries of compounds. Virtual screening is a cheminformatics tool applied using two categories of ligand-based and structure-based screening. The approach of virtual screening also utilizes target and ligand information to predict ADMET properties and other molecular characterization data [55].",

In the future, much effort will still be needed to better understand the biological mechanisms of toxicity and to develop more accurate predictive models for screening compounds [59]. An essential element for the successful use of non-animal and purified safety tests is to improve understanding of chemical exposure and to determine the chemical concentrations measured during cell-based analysis and in vivo studies, and how the predicted human exposure relates to the tested levels. Approaches include understanding this and helping to design toxicology studies using existing information about human exposure [60].",

Understanding the development and appliance of QSAR models is critical to the powerful uses of such tools [61]. Using computer models to accurately predict toxicological outcomes is an important task, but current in silico toxicology is now based on advances in mechanotoxicity and predictive models that have grown remarkably in computing resources over the last decade. The integrated computer-aided discovery and redesign (CADRE) platform is used as a model for key molecular interactions in the toxic pathway [62]. CADRE offers distinct advantages over the primary screening of chemicals and suggests that it could be performed as an alternative in silico tool that is allowed in legislative programs [62]. In silico models are essential for identifying organ-level toxicity and developing integrated alternative methods for the replacement of animal experiments. SA can be directly predictive of toxicity, can support the formation of categories to facilitate readability, and is particularly important in deciphering the myriad mechanisms of action that cause organ-level toxicity [63].",

As the number of workers or end users who use them for commercial purposes and are exposed to these chemicals every day increases, the need to assess their potential side effects in a cost-effective manner is growing. These data-driven models can be used to accelerate the decision-making process by screening hazards, and making early identification and management of potential toxicity, and physicochemical properties; and maximizing the use of information that these models provide can also support the industrial, regulatory, and public needs for safer chemicals [64]. In addition, further research is needed on how to use the in silico programs to protect workers\u2019 health in industries that manufacture, use, and distribute various chemicals. Since skin sensitization is a complex immune disease that has a significant impact on workers\u2019 health, the computational QSARs provide a screening tool and provide useful information for chemical toxicity assessment [65]. Carcinogenic substances are becoming increasingly problematic in the development of chemicals, because they have a serious impact on workers\u2019 health. Cheminformatics provides a computer method for learning from chemistry data and for the modeling tasks facing chemists. The development of methods for predicting toxicity and assessing risks can meet social concerns about the effects of chemicals on workers\u2019 health. Together with bioinformatics, our understanding of events in living organisms can deepen, so that new strategies can be developed to treat diseases.",
