The predominance of CD8 T lymphocytes in the inflammatory cell infiltrate during acute KD [5] implicates an intracellular pathogen as the etiologic agent. Our discovery that synthetic antibodies A and J bind to intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies in acute KD ciliated bronchial epithelium leads to speculation that the antibodies bind to antigens derived from the etiologic agent of KD and that the site of primary infection for acute KD may be the medium-sized bronchi of the lungs. Although limited TEM studies have been performed on lymph nodes, kidneys, conjunctivae, and peripheral blood from patients with acute KD [15] [16] [17] [18] , the lungs have not been examined.

Classic lipofuscin is an age-related pigment-it is especially seen in adult liver, brain, and heart-and consists of oxidatively modified cross-linked proteins originating from autophagocytized, indigestible cytoplasmic components [21] . Although accumulations of lipofuscin can be observed in the neurons of children with neuronal ceroid lipofuscinosis, we were unable to find a precedent for accumulations of lipofuscinlike material in tissues from otherwise healthy infants or even infants with other respiratory infections (such as RSV infection), particularly in bronchial epithelium. The lower quantity of pigment detected by Fontana stain, compared with that observed as golden yellow granular pigment detected by HE stain, and the relatively small pleomorphic brown bodies observed in the IHC preparations suggest that the pigment observed in HE-stained sections is not classic, age-related lipofuscin but rather may be pigment formed during a process of lysosomal degradation of virus. Acute KD ciliated bronchial epithelium appears to contain large quantities of protein in inclusion bodies. The major cytoplasmic pathway used by eukaryotic cells to selectively degrade excess proteins is ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis in the proteasome. Proteins not degraded by proteasomes can be autophagocytized, further oxidized within lysosomes, and, therefore, partly converted into lipofuscin. It is possible that excessive viral protein produced in the bronchial epithelial cells cannot be handled by the proteasome and that, as a result, lysosomal activity is increased. Alternatively, several viruses-such as adenovirus [22] , herpesviruses [23] , and, potentially, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (CoV) [24] -may produce proteins that interfere with proteasome function to their advantage. Proteasome inhibition has been shown to enhance lipofuscin formation [25] .
