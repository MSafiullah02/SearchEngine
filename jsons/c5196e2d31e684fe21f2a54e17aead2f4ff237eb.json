Obtaining accurately assembled, complete viral genomes directly from clinical samples is still a challenging task due to the low amount of viral nucleic acid in the clinical specimen compared to host DNA, and to the size of SARS-CoV-2 genome, which is around 30 kb in length. Despite those limitations, we developed a sequencing protocol that successfully obtained whole genomes from SARS-CoV-2 positive samples referred to the National Reference laboratory at FIOCRUZ in Brazil. This protocol was further optimised for higher throughput sequencing at University College London Pathogen Genomics Unit and UCL Genomics to sequence genomes for the COVID-19 Genomics UK Consortium (COG-UK).",

This protocol has been applied to Ebola, Zika, Chikungunya and SARS-CoV-2 sequencing (3) (4) (5) (6) using preferentially short amplicons (~ 450 base pairs). Nanopore sequencing allows rapid turnaround times (1-2 days) for obtaining a consensus sequence directly from clinical samples and a allows faster response during an outbreak. In this study, we adapted this protocol to recover longer 2 kb reads, decreasing the number of primers required and thus reducing possible mismatches and/or undesired interactions. Additionally, it is easier to assemble larger viral genomes from longer reads enabling higher depth coverage (more than 100 x) in a reduced sequencing time.",

The protocol was validated with RNA extracted from some of the first COVID-19 cases detected in Brazil and then optimized and developed for automation at two sequencing facilities at UCL (PGU and UCL Genomics) in London UK. Alternative protocols for Illumina platform, based on an initial amplification of larger fragments (8kb and 10.5kb) produced by one-step RT-PCR with high fidelity enzyme blends were also tested. However, they were prone to producing false mutations, likely due errors during amplification. Based on the fact that SARS-CoV-2 remains conserved, presenting few mutations scattered throughout the genome, the possibility of artificial mutations must be ruled out. We have demonstrated that this overlapping long amplicon multiplex PCR protocol suitable for samples with a wide range of viral loads, generating high coverage throughout the viral genome without artificial indels. It worked well on all four platforms tested (MinION, GridION, Illumina and Sanger) making it suitable for labs with distinct expertise, enabling successful rapid sequencing recovery of the SARS-CoV-2 genome directly from clinical samples.",
