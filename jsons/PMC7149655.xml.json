Or, in other words, this rate of turnover translates into an annual culling rate of 25\u201333% necessitating a supply of herd replacements in the form of heifers. These rather high culling rates produce a significant drain on income because the dairy producer loses in milk income (the cull generally produces more milk than her younger replacement), funds expended to purchase the replacement, and also may lose on the value of the calf born to the replacement depending on its genetic merit. In other words, the cost of a replacement heifer equals her purchase cost or value (if raised on the farm) plus the losses in milk yield (difference in the greater value of the milk from the cow and her replacement for what would be the remainder of the cull cow's lactation) minus the recovery value of the cull (sale price of a cull). As a result, the recovery value of the cull when sold is only about one-third to one-half the cost of purchasing her replacement. The time-sensitive nature of establishing pregnancy in dairy heifers dictates that excellent management inputs are required including the use of various hormones to manipulate the oestrus cycle to achieve pregnancy.",

Age at first calving is the single most important variable influencing the costs of raising heifers. Age at first calving could be defined as total days on feed since birth and is a function of the rate at which mating weight (age) and conception is achieved. Once pregnancy is established, total days on feed become fixed. Costs associated with age at first calving include feed, labour, housing, interest on investment, mating and veterinary health, and death loss. To reduce the costs associated with rearing heifers, one must reduce age at first calving or reduce feed costs because they represent approximately 60% of total rearing costs. Reducing age at first calving is more easily achieved because finding significant savings on low-cost feeds is unlikely given their lack of universal availability to most producers. In a recent survey, the average cost to raise a home-grown heifer was just US$100 more than if the heifer was raised on a custom heifer-rearing operation.",

Most dairy breeds achieve puberty by 11\u201312 months of age or sooner as long as they are fed according to National Research Council (NRC) standards for energy, protein, fibre, minerals and vitamins. The NRC recommendations are an accepted minimum standard. Research based on the former 1989 standards showed that when all nutrient requirements were increased by 15%, heifers grew more adequately and produced more milk in their lifetime than those fed at the NRC standard rates. Age, but not body weight, at puberty was reduced by 3 weeks in those fed at the 115% standard. Most studies conclude that optimal age at calving to maximize lifetime performance is 23 months, whereas optimal profit was achieved at first calving ages of 25 months. Attempts to reduce age at first calving should avoid having heifers calving at less than 22 months of age. Heifers calving at younger ages (<22 months) are more likely to experience dystocia and are subsequently three to four times more likely to have a retained placenta, metritis or reduced reproductive efficiency, and to be culled from the herd. In addition, first lactation yields may be lower.",

When heifers first stand to be mounted from the rear by another female, this begins the period of oestrus and a new (or first) oestrus cycle (see\nOESTRUS CYCLES | Characteristics). The period of oestrus is about 10 to 18 hours in duration and begins each new oestrus cycle (day 0 of the cycle). About 90% of cycling heifers show a slightly bloody discharge (bloody tail or metoestrual bleeding) from the vulva 1 to 2 days after oestrus whether or not they were inseminated or have conceived. This is a sign that they were in oestrus. The oestrus cycle is about 21 days in duration and normally ranges from 18 to 24 days. Cycles shorter than 18 days may occur in heifers after they experience their first oestrus at puberty. The oestrus cycle is cyclic because in the absence of fertile mating or artificial insemination (AI) during oestrus, a new oestrus will occur in approximately 3 weeks.",

The corpus luteum produces progesterone necessary to prepare the uterus for a potential pregnancy. In the absence of a viable embryo at about day 16 to 17 of the 21-day cycle, the corpus luteum dies or regresses (this process is known as luteolysis); otherwise, the embryo helps to preserve the corpus luteum to allow pregnancy to continue. Prostaglandin F2\u03b1 (PGF2\u03b1) is secreted by the uterus to cause death of the corpus luteum (luteolysis) around day 18 of the cycle in the absence of a viable embryo. As the corpus luteum regresses, new ovarian follicles begin to grow and mature, one of which will be selected to ovulate just after the heifer goes out of oestrus, producing the egg that potentially will form a new calf upon fertilization.

Furthermore, overconditioned (fat) heifers do not reproduce well and will not produce milk to their genetic potential. Waiting to breed heifers when older than 14 to 15 months fails to result in more milk production in their lifetime. Inseminating heifers at 13 to 14 months of age allows for pregnancy to become established at 14 to 15 months of age and for most replacements to calve by 2 years of age. It is important that heifers calve at or near 2 years of age to reduce their rearing costs by producing milk at an earlier age as discussed above. First-service conception rates (pregnancy) should range from 50% to 70% in heifers. About 5% of heifers eventually fail to conceive for various reasons and must be culled.\n",

Injection of PGF2\u03b1 lyses any functional corpus luteum 24 h prior to removal of the insert. Generally, inseminations occur after detected oestrus during a 2\u20135-day period after its removal. One also can inject PGF2\u03b1 at the same time the insert is removed. In this case, oestrus will be delayed by approximately 12\u201324 h and more variable in its range of occurrence. A more simple and less expensive method (see (3) in Figure 1) includes detection of oestrus during 6 days and then inseminating any oestrual heifers according to signs of oestrus. On the 7th day, PGF2\u03b1 is injected in any noninseminated heifer to induce luteolysis and oestrus for subsequent insemination. The success of this method depends on the accuracy and efficiency of visual detection of oestrus. A more complicated method involves giving two injections of PGF2\u03b1 14 days apart. One can only inseminate oestrus-detected heifers after the second of two injections (see (4) in Figure 1) or inseminate after both injections (see (5) in Figure 1) and reduce the number of second injections to all noninseminated heifers. Timing of inseminations without regard to detected oestrus at 72\u201380 h after PGF2\u03b1 produces lower conception rates than with inseminations made after detected oestrus.",

The objective of this diagnosis is to find nonpregnant heifers so they can be treated promptly to induce a new fertile oestrus. The treatments utilized on nonpregnant heifers can include any of those short-term methods described above. Historically, when palpation occurs, the heifer is given an injection of PGF2\u03b1 when a functional corpus luteum is palpated on the ovary and subsequent behaviour is monitored for visual signs of oestrus. When oestrus synchronization is performed before first AI, the day of oestrus generally is known when palpation occurs.

Associated costs and investments in replacements are significant at 15\u201320% of all farm costs. Timeliness of establishing pregnancy is significantly improved when using various hormonal schemes to programme the oestrus cycle to facilitate the use of AI and ensure a greater proportion of heifers calve by 24 months of age. Sire selection should emphasize production traits and calving ease to maintain high production but facilitate fewer problems at first parturition. Because heifers are more fertile than their lactating counterparts, the best sires can be used with a much greater cost\u2013benefit ratio.",
