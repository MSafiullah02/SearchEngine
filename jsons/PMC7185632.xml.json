Among the about 1415 currently known human infectious diseases, c.a. 58 to 61% have an established animal origin [1], [2]. Ruminants, carnivores, rodents, birds and primates constitute, in the order, the five major animal categories that have transmitted pathogens to human populations [3]. This percentage increases to 73\u201375% if only the \u201cemerging\u201d or \u201cre-emerging\u201d diseases, which have appeared in the last 30 to 40 years, are considered [2], [3]. The work by Woolhouse et al. [4] has also shown that these pathogens have an important range of host reservoir species as about 60% of them have 3 or more host species (in addition to humans), thus highlighting the notion that pathogen dynamics driven by a multiplicity of hosts is a more realistic picture for emerging infectious diseases [5].",

Therefore, it is easy to recognize the importance of a better understanding of animal species as potential hosts and sources of novel contaminations in humans [6]. The recent appearance and propagation of the highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza (bird flu), West Nile fever, Lyme disease, rabies as well as of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), all of animal origin, have truly highlighted the role of animal species as major reservoirs for (new) human infections. Understanding how they are transmitted in animal species communities and identifying the underlying ecological and evolutionary mechanisms is essential to lessen the transmission risk to humans [7]. Anthropogenic changes in landscapes, particularly habitat destruction and fragmentation [4] and their subsequent effects on biological diversity have led to disease emergence in a number of situations [8]. Here, we discuss new insights gained from studies that explicitly acknowledge the contribution of multi-host species systems to the dynamics of emerging pathogens. Throughout this review, we also argue on the necessity to better cross-fertilize the two separate research fields of epidemiology and ecology of infectious diseases if we want to anticipate future epidemics. Finally, we recommend an increased attention to the role of the many epizootic host species and the weakly competent vectors in disease transmission not only among themselves, but also in driving the infection towards human communities.",

These relations can take different forms according to the animal communities under study. For instance, Fisher et al. [10] showed statistically that this relation follows a geometrical law (Fig. 1\n) for butterfly communities. A few years later, Preston showed that this relation takes more frequently the shape of a log-normal distribution in mammal communities [11], [12] (Fig. 1). These two explanations have been unified only recently following Hubbell's demonstration that both relations correspond to two specific situations of another more general distribution called zero-sum multinomial [13].",

Since it is not sufficient to account for the observed community structure, trophic networks should not be dismissed as they might be another important contributing mechanism to the dynamics of ecological communities [14]. However, within these networks, the importance of parasitic organisms (e.g., viruses, bacteria, protozoans, helminth worms.) has been frequently ignored due to sampling issues. Parasites are surprisingly important in food webs and their role in food web stability is increasingly recognized [15], [16], [17]. First, by inducing a differential mortality among the host species, parasites can positively or negatively influence the abundance and the spatial distribution of the host species they use as resources. Second, and this aspect has been less studied, parasites can affect food webs and interacting host species especially by altering trophic cascades.",

The case of the accidental introduction of bovine rinderpest in the wild ungulate communities of the Serengeti National Park in 1892 is here emblematic [15]. The disease decimated different animal species. This, in turn, caused the decrease in the predation pressure on the vegetation, leading, at the same time, to a modification of the vegetation cover of the savannah that made it less favourable to fire development.",

In the case of a generalist parasite that can thus infect a significant range of host species, the consequences are generally destabilizing for the host communities. Indeed, if a parasite species can simultaneously attack many host species, the ones that are more tolerant to the parasite (i.e., the host species that can support the reproduction of the parasite while sustaining little damage) will engender an \u201capparent\u201d competition with the less tolerant host species that will pay for the cost of the parasite virulence. In Scotland, the parasitic nematode Heterakis gallinarum infects both pheasants and partridges [18]. This pathogen multiplies very well in pheasants without decreasing the size of their population that, as a result, shows a great tolerance towards this parasite. For partridges, the situation is the opposite because a large proportion of partridges infected by this nematode will rapidly die. The degree of abundance of pheasants in the community has thus the consequence of increasing locally the nematode incidence and this will directly affect the abundance of partridges, which are more susceptible to the parasite (Fig. 2\n). Although we cannot propose other examples as representative as this one, in nature such situations must be frequently encountered.",

For pathogens with \u201cdensity-dependent transmission\u201d, in general any local addition of host species is likely to enhance disease transmission due to the increase in contact rates among individual hosts within the community [20]. This situation is often observed in the case of directly-transmitted infectious pathogens, like rodent-borne hantaviruses or avian influenza viruses [5], [20]. A second situation is that of pathogens with \u201cfrequency-dependent transmission\u201d in which contacts among host individuals occur at a constant frequency and do not depend on the host population density. This type of transmission is assumed for sexually transmitted pathogens, like HIV, in which the number of sexual contacts does not increase with the size of the population. Another example of frequency-dependent transmission concerns vector-borne diseases, e.g. malaria, in which the transmission is from host to host via a mosquito vector. This type of transmission is also encountered with pathogens transmitted by ticks, such as Lyme disease for instance. Here, the frequency of blood meals by the arthropod vectors generally does not increase with the abundance of host individuals [21].",

During a blood meal from an infected reservoir host, the vector can be contaminated and transmit the parasite to healthy host individuals. In this context, the individuals challenged by the pathogen can be from a single host species (for a host-specialized parasite) or can belong to different host species (for a generalist, nonspecialized parasite). In the case of a nonspecialized, multi-species system, the local conditions of species richness and composition in reservoir hosts will have important consequences on the disease transmission, as it has been shown by Richard Ostfeld et al. [22], [23]. These authors have analysed the circulation of the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi, responsible of Lyme disease in North America. This biological model, which involves numerous reservoir host species and only one vector species (the tick species Ixodes scapularis), represents an interesting first step for the study of pathogen transmission in multi-species systems. Each of these potential reservoir species has naturally a different competence to multiply the pathogen and to transmit it again during a blood meal by noninfected ticks. Here, we will define as susceptibility the probability that a healthy host individual might become infected following a contact with an infected vector [24]. Hence, in animal species communities, each reservoir and vector species has a different susceptibility that is characteristic of that species. In reality, within a host (reservoir or vector) species, important differences in susceptibility can be observed, but it is difficult to integrate this intraspecies variability due to the simplicity of the epidemiological models that are currently used. By focusing on the interspecific variability of susceptibilities, Ostfeld et al. have carried out a series of experimental and field studies that have demonstrated the importance of the local composition in reservoir host species on the transmission of the bacterium responsible of Lyme disease [24].",

Further studies on the West Nile virus, which is transmitted by different mosquito species and many bird species in the USA, have also highlighted a tendency to lower pathogen circulation in the presence of greater host bird richness [25]. The results of the few empirical studies, which have been carried out, converge and indicate that local communities with low richness in reservoir host species tend to present higher levels of disease prevalence (Fig. 3\n), whereas local communities that involve a larger number of reservoir hosts species see this level decreasing (Fig. 3).

First, using an epidemiological model of the Susceptible-Infected-Resistant (SIR) type that relies on allometric laws to quantify the different parameters, Dobson [21] analysed the epidemiological consequences of host reservoir species inclusion (up to six, and progressively less susceptible) in a virtual host community. Among other outputs, Dobson [21] studied the basic reproduction number (R\n0) that quantifies the mean number of new infections caused by a single infected host individual. He underlined that, in the case of frequency-dependent transmission, the value of R\n0 decreases when the richness in host species increases, which represents a direct application of the previously described \u201cdilution effect\u201d phenomenon. This first theoretical formalism had the merit of introducing a theoretical framework to explain the dilution effect observed empirically. Nevertheless the low reservoir species richness involved (6 species) and the fact that Dobson's work considered only directly transmitted infections did not allow the generalization of these results to vector-borne diseases, especially when multiple vector species are involved.",

For two local communities with the same reservoir species richness and abundance but with different species compositions, an increase in the variation of the reservoir species susceptibility corresponded to a greater number of reservoir species with lower level of susceptibility. An immediate consequence is that an important number of vectors, all other proportions kept identical, will feed on reservoir individuals which are less able to transmit the pathogen. Thus, the interspecific variation in susceptibility of the host reservoirs is an important criterion that on its own can explain the decrease in prevalence of a pathogen in vector populations. In practice, these pathogen dynamics are usually the result of a balance mainly between efficient transmission by competent hosts and abortive transmission by poorly competent hosts that can likely lead to a dilution effect (Fig. 4\n). Indeed, it is not, strictly speaking, the local richness in reservoir species that acts on the level of prevalence of the pathogen in the vectors, but the proportion of reservoir species with low susceptibility, which tends to augment in species-rich communities, that decreases the intensity of vector-borne transmission.",

Nevertheless, the vector species community also plays an important part in disease transmission. The dilution effect has been most thoroughly studied in vector-borne diseases, especially Lyme disease, which, in the USA, is transmitted by a single tick species, I. scapularis\n[22], [23], [26]. This, therefore, might not be representative of the many indirectly transmitted zoonotic pathogens for which several vector species may be more or less competent in disease transmission. For zoonotic vector-borne infections, there are two types of contacts: (i) between infectious vectors and more or less susceptible reservoir hosts and (ii) between infectious host reservoirs and more or less susceptible vectors. Indeed, the dilution effect requires that vector contacts must be wasted on poorly competent reservoirs, but also that vector species richness, by increasing their abundance, cannot compensate for these wasted contacts to overcome the dilution effect. In the case of vector-borne pathogens, the analysis of the species richness-abundance curves of the local vector communities in the different models allows the assessment of the effect of the number of vector species in a given community on the pathogen persistence and prevalence. This raises two important questions concerning: (i) the effects on local disease transmission of the accidental introduction or biological invasion by exotic vectors, even when they show a low competence to transmit the infection; and (ii) the role of low to very low competent resident vector species on the general circulation of pathogens. Moreover, it highlights what is perhaps a key issue in the understanding of vector-borne emerging pathogens. Although medium to very high competent vector species are usually credited with the maintenance and transmission of a disease, the role of the many poorly to very poorly competent vectors should not be underestimated as recent evidences have shown for bovine catarrhal fever (also known as Blue Tongue disease) in Northern Europe [28], Chikungunya in Italy [29] and Reunion Island [30], or malaria in Corsica [31].",

Indeed, depending on the local species richness and composition in host reservoirs and vectors, we may observe different disease trends (Fig. 4; and see also Begon [5]). This model clearly illustrates the mechanics and the potential role played by the biological diversity of host reservoirs and vectors in vector-borne infections. A possible example of this is represented by the transmission of West Nile virus. West Nile virus is a Flavivirus commonly found in Africa, West Asia, Middle East, Eastern Europe, Northern and Central America and West Indies that causes encephalitis (inflammation of brain and spinal chord) in humans and horses. West Nile disease is transmitted by different mosquito vectors, which bite and infect birds. Many mosquito species have been tested positive for this pathogen [32], but in experimental studies the most susceptible one seems to be the Culex species complex [33]. Infections have been identified mostly in wild birds (and even domestic ones), which are the primary reservoirs for the virus. Although most wild bird species are not affected and rather act as more or less amplifying reservoirs, members of the Corvid family, including crows, blue jays, magpies and ravens, are very susceptible to the effects of West Nile virus. The virus can also infect many different dead-end hosts in terms of transmission, including humans and other mammals.",

Conversely, in the USA, where there are a multitude of bird reservoir species (of which a large part appears to be very susceptible) and an important diversity in vector species (some vectors being highly competent), huge epidemics that have propagated to the entire country, from east to west, in only a few years have been reported [32]. The absence of previous immunity in bird populations to this virus (West Nile Fever appeared in North America in 1999) cannot explain this pattern due to the fast demographic turnover within avian communities.",

Indeed, animal viruses with multiple hosts are more likely to be designated as emerging threats than the ones with single hosts, a finding that emphasizes the importance of better examining the role played by host and vector diversity [3], [7].

Overall, the evidence that the local host diversity influences the outcomes of disease dynamics seems clear for both Lyme disease and West Nile virus. As a consequence, not considering a priori the potential role played by poorly to very poorly competent hosts \u2013 the immersed part of the iceberg \u2013, and particularly of vectors, under the pretext of a low or very low supposed or proven participation in the transmission, can have important ecological and epidemiological consequences.

Given the recent emergence of important infectious diseases in several complex communities [8], more attention should be given to generalist pathogens and to recording the number and identity of all potential vector and reservoir species locally, instead of focusing only on the more competent, well-accepted hosts and vectors. It is clear from this review that to better understand multi-species dynamics of diseases, we should rather collect qualitative information on the largest possible number of actors in disease dynamics than to obtain quantitative and substantial data but only for one or two reservoir hosts or vectors that are a priori suspected to be involved in the transmission. Moreover, since we can observe both spatial and temporal variations in local species diversity, such analysis should be repeated in several different communities and for different periods of time in order to infer on disease regional dynamics and on its effects on host assemblages, and vice versa. In addition, the potential for an accidental introduction in an originally untouched geographical area of some vector specimens, even if they are not very competent in transmitting the pathogen, should not be underestimated especially because they might originate or exacerbate the onset of an epidemic. The same could be said also about resident vectors and reservoir hosts that are accepted as being putatively low to very low competent hosts, but might play a key starting role in the epidemiology of a disease.",

From an evolutionary point of view, pathogens should select for the best host vessels that facilitate their own survival and dissemination.

In this case, therefore, the link between pathogen prevalence and species richness was a reflection of the community composition rather than of the community richness. To what extent, this observation might be applied to other multi-species systems is still a matter of debate.

The development of livestock rearing in Western countries, by increasing the herd of animals with low susceptibility, has been suggested to be responsible, according to Bruce-Chwatt [37], to the disappearance of malaria in Europe. This method, which has been theoretically studied for malaria [38], is still considered for application in some regions of Asia [39]. This calls into question the importance, in practice, of the community function in the epidemiology of infections.

The diversity of reservoir hosts dilutes disease transmission (dilution effect) and the pathogen dynamics drops.
