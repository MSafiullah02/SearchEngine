Her body height, head circumference, and chest circumference were 48.0 cm, 35.0 cm, and 32.0 cm, respectively. Her developmental milestone was uneventful until 1 year of age when she was diagnosed to have bronchial asthma. Although the body size at birth was within normal range, it gradually fell behind the mean value of the Japanese children. At 5 years, her body height was 94.9 cm (standard deviation \u22122.7), and the body weight was 13.9 kg (\u22121.5). Her chest circumference was 46.0 (mean value 53.7) cm. Her familial history was negative for delayed growth or puberty. Another notable feature was myopia and conspicuous funneling of the chest, which started developing around 2 years of age. She was noted to have a genu varum (bowlegs), with her knee joints 4.5 cm apart from each other while the ankles were together. Scoliosis or narrowing of the spines was not present, with the Cobb angle of 13\u00b0. The radiographic evaluation revealed that seven of eight carpal bones were ossified. There was no brachydactyly. There was no deformity of the skull, nor patent fontanelle and sutures. The skeletal maturity score, using the Tanner\u2013Whitehouse method-2 [3] was 245; the number corresponds to the age of 63 months. Her blood chemistry data were within normal ranges. The hormone testing was notable for low insulin-like growth factor (somatomedin-C) level of 59 (normal 56\u2013252 at 5 years) ng/ml. The short stature homeobox (SHOX) gene was negative.",

The aorta was first retracted away from the airway towards the chest wall using pledgeted sutures. A ringed PTFE prosthesis, 14 mm in size, was cut into two semicircular pieces. The midline stitches were placed and passed through the graft. The redundant ends of the graft were trimmed off and lateral ends of the cartilage were sutured to the graft. The other graft piece was fixed to the membrane by stitches placed along the midline. Both ends of the membrane stent were then trimmed off. The grafts were finally covered with a 0.1 mm PTFE sheet to prevent esophageal erosion (Fig. 2).",

            "text": "The first point of discussion regarding this case is the mechanism of vascular compression. Left bronchial compression by the descending aorta and the pulmonary artery, as was seen in this case, is the most frequently observed pattern of vascular compression. It typically develops after repair of the obstructive aortic arch. In this context, the descending aorta is shifted anteriorly and, thus, compress the airway against the anteriorly located pulmonary artery. On the contrary, the mechanism seen in the present case may be quite unique. On the CT scan, there was a severe funneling of the chest, causing the heart to be shifted leftward. This seemed to cause shifting of the pulmonary artery posteriorly, and finally compressed the left bronchus against the descending aorta. It draws interest that this patient had some features suggestive of skeletal dysplasia, such as short stature, genu varum, and myopia. It is known that a laryngotracheomalacia may associate skeletal dysplasia, such as craniocarpotarsal dysplasia, frontometaphyseal dysplasia, and Kniest dysplasia [4, 5]. Considering these facts, her funnel chest, which gradually developed under the condition of tracheobronchial malacia, could be the effect of labored breathing\u2014from airway malacia, bronchial stenosis, and pneumonia\u2014on the fragile thoracic cavity.",

            "text": "The second point of discussion is the optimal treatment for this patient. Aortopexy is generally considered a main stem of the surgical repair [6] for vascular compression. However, in the situation of compression between the pulmonary artery and the descending aorta, aortopexy may be ineffective. Aortopexy is effective only if the other side of the airway to the vessel possess a fibrous continuity with a stable structure. One example of this is the tracheal compression by the anteriorly placed vessel. In this context, the trachea is firmly stabilized by the posterior fibrous tissue and, therefore, the anterior retraction of the vessel by the aortopexy expands the airway. This mechanism does not apply to the compression of the left bronchus, which is embedded in the soft and mobile lung. Moreover, some report its high failure rate due to an irreversible structural deformity of the cartilage [7], which was expected in the present case, in whom the bronchial compression had persisted for at least 2 years. ES, another option, is a unique surgical procedure to expand and stabilize the airway, by suspending its wall to the surrounding rigid prosthesis. It has been proven to be a reliable method to relieve airway compression in children [8], and was considered an optimal procedure for this patient. Presently, she enjoys her daily life almost free from respiratory symptom. However, follow-up of the skeletal dysplasia, whose presence remained to be identified, will be mandatory.",
