We relate the fatality date of each deceased patient to the corresponding day of registration of the infection, leading to a nowcasting model which allows us to estimate the number of present-day infections that will, at a later date, prove to be fatal. The numbers are broken down to the district level in Germany. Given that death counts generally provide more reliable information on the spread of the disease compared to infection counts, which inevitably depend on testing strategy and capacity, the proposed model and the presented results allow to obtain reliable insight into the current state of the pandemic in Germany.",

            "text": "In March 2020, COVID-19 became a global pandemic. From Wuhan, China, the virus spread across the whole world, and with its diffusion, more and more data became available to scientists for analytical purposes. In daily reports, the WHO provides the number of registered infections as well as the daily death toll globally (https://www.who.int/). It is inevitable for the number of registered infections to depend on the testing strategy in each country (see e.g. Cohen and Kupferschmidt, 2020) . This has a direct influence on the number of undetected infections (see e.g. Li et al., 2020) , and first empirical analyses aim to quantify how detected and undetected infections are related (see e.g. Niehus et al., 2020) . Though similar issues with respect to data quality hold for the reported number of fatalities (see e.g. Baud et al., 2020) , the number of deaths can overall be considered a more reliable source of information than the number of registered infections. The results of the \"Heinsberg Study\" in Germany point in the same direction (Streeck et al., 2020) . A thorough analysis of death counts can in turn generate insights on changes in infections as proposed in Flaxman et al. (2020) (see also Ferguson et al., 2020) . In this paper we pursue the idea of directly modelling registered death counts instead of registered infections. We analyse data from Germany and break down the analyses to a regional level. Such regional view is apparently immensely important, considering the local nature of some of the outbreaks for example in Italy (see e.g. , France (see e.g. Massonnaud et al., 2020) or Spain.",

A first approach on modelling and analysing the time from illness and onset of symptoms to reporting and further to death is given in Jung et al. (2020) (see also Linton et al., 2020) . Understanding the delay between onset and registration of an infection and, for severe cases, the time between registered infection and death can be of vital importance. Knowledge on those time spans allows us to obtain estimates for the number of infections that are expected to be fatal based on the number of infections registered on the present day. The statistical technique to obtain such estimates is called nowcasting (see e.g. H\u00f6hle and an der Heiden, 2014) and traces back to Lawless (1994) . Nowcasting in Covid-19 data analyses is not novel and is for instance used in G\u00fcnther et al. (2020) for nowcasting daily infection counts, that is to adjust daily reported new infections to include infections which occurred the same day but were not yet reported. We extend this approach to model the delay between the registration date of an infection and its fatal outcome.",

We employ flexible statistical models with smooth components (see e.g. Wood, 2017) assuming a district specific Poisson process. The spatial structure in the death rate is incorporated in two ways. First, we assume a spatial correlation of the number of deaths by including a long-range smooth spatial death intensity. This allows to show that regions of Germany are affected to different extents. On top of this long-range effect we include two types of unstructured region specific effects. An overall region specific effect reflects the situation of a district as a whole, while a short-term effect mirrors region specific variation of fatalities over time and captures local outbreaks as happened in e.g. Heinsberg (North-Rhine-Westphalia) or Tirschenreuth (Bavaria). In addition we include dynamic effects to capture the global changes in the number of fatal infections for Germany over calendar time. This enables us to investigate the impact of certain interventions, such as social distancing, school closure, complete lockdowns and lockdown releases, on the dynamic of the infection and hence on the number of deaths.",

This means that the time stamp for a fatal outcome always refers to the registration date and not to the death date. Due to daily downloads of the data we can derive the time point of death (or to be more specific, the time point when the death of a case is included in the database). We obtain the latter by observing a status change from infected to deceased when comparing the data from two consecutive days. The Robert-Koch-Institute collects the data from the district-based health authorities (Gesundheits\u00e4mter). Due to different population sizes in the districts and certainly also because of different local situations, some health authorities report the daily numbers to the Robert-Koch-Institute with a delay.

A remarkable difference is also observed between genders, where the expected death rate of females is around 40% (\u2248 1 \u2212 exp(\u22120.503)) lower than the death rate for males.

Among those, Traunstein and Rosenheim (in the south-east part of Bavaria) are the most evident, but Greiz and Sonneberg (east and south part of Thuringia) stand out as well, to mention a few.

This is done on a national level, and the resulting nowcast of fatal infections for Germany is shown in Figure 3 . For example, on May 14, 2020 there are 25 deaths reported where the infection was registered on May 5th (red line on May 5th). We expect this number to increase to about 50 when all deaths due to Covid-19 for this registration date will have been reported (blue line on May 5th). Naturally, the closer a date is to the present, the larger the uncertainty in the nowcast. This is shown by the shaded bands. Details on how the statistical uncertainty has been quantified are provided in Section 5 below. The fit of this model has been incorporated into the district model discussed before, but the nowcast results are interesting in their own right. The curve confirms that the number of fatal infections is decreasing since the beginning of April.

Note that time point t refers to the time point of registration, i.e. the date at which the infection was confirmed. Even though the time point of infection obviously precedes that of death, registration can also occur after death, e.g. when a post mortem test is conducted, or when test results arrive after the patient has passed away. We set the day of death to be equal to the day of registered infections in this case. The majority of fatalities with registered infection at time point t have not yet been observed at time t, as these deaths will occur later.

This shows that the German health care system remained stable over the considered period, and hence survival did not depend on the date on which the infection was notified. The bottom panel of Figure 4 shows the course of the disease as a smooth effect over the time between registration of the infection and death. We see that the probabilities \u03c0(d; \u00b7) decrease in d, where this effect is the strongest in the first days after registration. Thus, most of the Covid-19 patients with fatal infections are expected to die not long after their registration date. The effect of d becomes easier to interpret by visualizing the resulting distribution function F t (d). This is shown in Figure 5 for two dates t, i.e.. April 14th and May 13th.

The two plots in Figure 7 map the region specific effects, i.e. the predicted long term level of a district u r0 (left hand side) and the predicted short term dynamics u r1 (right hand side). Both plots uncover quite some region-specific variability. In particular, the short term dynamics captured in the right hand side plot (u r1 ) pinpoint districts with unexpectedly high nowcasted death rates in the last two weeks, after correcting for the global geographic trend and the long term effect of the district.

Thus, the death rate of people in the age group 80+ could vary differently across districts when compared to regional peaks in the death rate of the rest of the population.

This apparently neglects the estimation variability in the nowcasting model, which we explored via bootstrap as explained in Section 5.3 and visualized in Figure 3 . In order to also incorporate this uncertainty in the fit of the mortality model, we refitted the model using (a) the upper end and (b) the lower end of the prediction intervals shown in Figure 3 . It appears that there is little (and hardly any visible) effect on the spatial components, which is therefore not shown here. But the time trend shown in Figure 1 does change, which is visualized by including the two fitted functions corresponding to the 2.5% and 97.5% quantile of the offset function. We can see that the estimated uncertainty of the nowcast model mostly affects the last ten days, with a strong potential increase in the death rate mirroring a possible worst case scenario.",

Apart from some observations in the lower tail, the Pearson residuals are distributed very closely to a standard normal distribution when considering the estimate \u03c6 = 1.766 of the dispersion parameter in the quasi-poisson model (7). Overall, the model seems to fit to the available data quite well. The paper presents a model to monitor the dynamic behaviour of Covid-19 infections based on death counts. It is important to highlight that the proposed model makes no use of new infection numbers, but only of observed deaths related to Covid-19. This in turn means that the results are less dependent on testing strategies. The nowcasting approach enables us to estimate the number of deaths following a registered infection today, even if the fatal outcome has not occurred yet. Moreover, the district level modelling uncovers hotspots, which are salient exclusively through increased death rates. A differential analysis of the number of current fatal infections on a regional level allows to draw conclusions on the current dynamics of the disease assuming a constant case fatality rate, i.e. a stable proportion of death compared to the true number of infections when adjusting for age and gender. A natural next step would now be to consider the nowcasted deaths in relation to the number of newly registered infections, which is, in contrast, highly dependent on both testing strategy and capacity. We consider this as future research, and the proposed model allows us to explore data in this direction. This might ultimately help us in shedding light on the relationship between registered and undetected infections as well as on the effectiveness of different testing strategies.",

First and utmost, even though death counts are, with respect to cases counts, less dependent on testing strategies, they are not completely independent from them. This applies in particular to the handling of post-mortem tests. We therefore do not claim that our analysis of death counts is completely unaffected by testing strategies. Secondly, a fundamental assumption in the model is the independence between the course of the disease and the number of infections. Overall, if the local health systems have sufficient capacity and triage can be avoided, this assumption seems plausible, but it is difficult or even impossible to prove the assumption formally. Finally, the nowcasting itself is not carried out on a regional level, though the model focuses on regional aspects of the pandemic. While it would be desirable to fit the nowcast model regionally, the limited amount of data simply prevents us from extending the model in this direction.",
