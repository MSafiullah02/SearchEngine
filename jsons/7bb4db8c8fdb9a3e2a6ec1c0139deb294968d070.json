With such recent 'disaster events', health security has emerged as a non-traditional security issue affecting national security and global security. The transborder nature of such disease outbreaks as Ebola, H1N1, H5N1, MERS, has emphasized the critical importance of understanding the complexity and resident vulnerabilities that pervade societies with regards to infectious disease threats. These outbreaks, with their transborder character, have resulted in significant global societal and economic impacts. For example, the Ebola epidemic of 2014 affected the West African countries of Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Guinea highlighting the risks of emerging pathogens on global populations. More than 28,000 Ebola cases were reported from the three countries during the epidemic, and >11,000 persons died. These countries are among the least developed in the The global health security landscape has an inherent 'wickedness' [4] to it, emerging from a dynamic complexity. Such 'wickedness' or messes are seemingly intractable and are characterized as value-laden, ambiguous and unstable, that resist being tamed by classical problem solving. Actions and interventions associated with this complex problem space can have highly unpredictable and unintended consequences' [5] . Helbing [6] argues that we have '. . .created pathways along which dangerous and damaging events can spread rapidly and globally'. The World Economic Forum Global Risks [7] places the spread of infectious diseases within the top 10 risks in terms of impact. The risks that pervade our hyper connected world highlight the '. . .fragility and vulnerabilities that lie within the social/technological/ economic/political/ecological interdependent systems' [8] . This certainly challenges linear, reductionist approaches to problem framing and solution navigation. Woods [9: 316] ask the question:",

As described in Masys [5] , in this complex problem landscape associated with global health security, systems thinking provides a worldview that informs one's understanding and can be used as an approach in problem solving. 'Systems thinking' as discussed in Senge [17] emphasizes interconnectedness, causal complexity and the relation of parts to the whole, thereby challenging traditional linear thinking and simple causal explanations. Senge [17] describes systems thinking as 'a discipline for seeing wholes. . .a framework for seeing interrelationships rather than things, for seeing patterns of change rather than static snapshots'. Systems thinking purports that, although events and objects may appear distinct and separate in space and time, they are all interconnected.",

Addressing existing problems in traditional ways, or using Cynefin terminology, addressing simple (with knowns) or complicated (with known unknowns) systems, is the domain of Total Quality Management (TQM), Six Sigma, and other analytic approaches. Innovation applies in potentially changing or replacing those types of systems but is more commonly applied in complex environment (unknown unknowns as a system \"probe\") or chaotic environments (unknowable as an action). 1 Capital is used here to mean any resource applied which could include funds, people, intellectual property, time, facilities, and even social capital such as reputation and favor exchange. 2 Any person, group, or \"thing\" (such as the environment and Dell's innovations around the circular economy) that has an interest or concern (can affect or be affected by) the innovation.

But once is not viable or sustainable, you must be able to deliver an innovation with repeatability, reliability, and regularly. If you cannot consistently deliver your innovation and its value proposition to its stakeholders, then it really isn't an innovation but a special event (or one off). As part of viability/sustainability is that the value delivered by the innovation must eventually exceed the resources consumed in its creation and other potential uses of those resources (opportunity costs). \u2022 An innovation must be valuable, and it is surprising how often this is missed.",

One part of lean focuses on eliminating waste and increasing efficiency (often under the term lean six sigma), which while important, happens after the introduction of the effective innovation.",

It is not only telling the innovators, but demonstrating it to them with the leasers own decisions and actions. \u2022 Actively participating. Innovation is not a steering committee exercise. The innovation leader is one of the innovators actively engaged in the innovation process and work with the team. \u2022 Engaged review. Innovation reviews should never be status dumps. They should be truly informative and engage debates on issues, opportunities to improve, changes in constraints, etc., involving the leader and an innovation team peer. \u2022 Process breaking. A typical managerial role is to enforce process, standards and limit variability. An innovation leader's role is the exact opposite. Seeking innovation is a de facto admission that current policy and process is not effective or efficient in addressing the problem or opportunity at hand. However organizations are designed around \"make no mistakes\", have no excess capacity, ensure conformance and other dictums that are the antithesis of innovation. The role of the leader is to cut through all those \"good for production efficiency and risk reduction\" rules, policy and process to enable incurring risk, increasing variability, and facilitate learning failure. \u2022 Being available. Innovation and addressing wicked problems is an ego bruising, if not busting, exercise in ongoing futility, with success around some distant corner.

Innovation requires creativity, it requires perseverance to address wicked problems which are never solved only made better or less worse, hopefully. Innovation work is not algorithmic in which the same thing is done repeatedly but is instead heuristic requiring the innovators to come up with new ways to do things continuously with no real instructions to follow other than their mental models. Pink's research and that of others examined traditional rewards and incentives when we want to motivate people to be creative, problems solving and innovative. Pink shows that extrinsic rewards can be effective for algorithmic tasks-those that depend on following an existing formula to its logical conclusion. But for more right-brain undertakings-those that demand flexible problem-solving, inventiveness, or conceptual understanding such as addressing wicked problems-contingent rewards can be counterproductive causing loss of intrinsic interest for the activity and the ability to persevere in it. Instead, the secret to motivating innovation isn't our traditional biological drives or our reward-and-punishment drive, but our third drive-our deep-seated desire to direct our own lives, to extend and expand our abilities, and to live a life of purpose.",

These are generally reliant on the existence of some future knowledge or capability do not yet possess and not sure where it might come from (but we can imagine it) in order to come about. Possible futures are imaginative. \u2022 Plausible futures. These could happen. They do not rely upon knowledge or capabilities that do not yet exist, or if they do, there is a reasonably clear path on how that knowledge or capability might emerge. Care needs to be taken here as this is determined by our current understanding of physical laws, processes, causation, systems of human interaction, regulation, and other areas where we may not be fully informed. Because of this, plausible futures should be researched to confirm or expand our understanding of the current state of knowledge and capabilities. These are a subset of the possible futures. \u2022 Probable futures. These are fundamentally continuations of current trends, a business as usual linear extension of the present, and are therefore considered likely to happen. These are usually the extent of most strategic planners' considerations. This is dangerous as few trends are continuous over long periods of time, and they made fade away suddenly or be usurped suddenly by a new one unexpectedly (unless identified in a possible or plausible future). Simply reading trends, which is what many marketeers and strategist do, is not foresight. The resulting probable futures is a much smaller subset of possible futures that may impact the enterprise and its stakeholders. \u2022 Preferable futures. These represent what we want to have happen. While the previous futures are basically cognitively and generally objectively derived, these involve value judgements and are more subjective. This set of futures can intersect any or the above futures and are not part of a continuous subset progression as the others are. \u2022 Wild card futures. These are low probability futures, or perhaps highly specific futures (reducing their probability for all of the complexity and chaos reasons discussed earlier) but have an additional characteristic that should they occur they would have a very significant outsized impact on our enterprise and/or its stakeholders. These futures are sometimes referred to as black swan events from their description and analysis by Taleb [44] (Fig. 9 ).",

However, there is an excellent collection of articles, instruction, videos for learning a disciplined approach to these topics at Complexity Labs. 17 Another good source for learning systems thinking is the Waters Foundation. 18 An excellent review of available resources on the topic is provided by Monat and Gannon [55] which the reader is encouraged to peruse. By understanding what a system is, it becomes easier to identify what system (or system of another system) you are dealing with at a moment in time, where its boundaries are, and how it is behaving. This is the critical first step in building a mental model or map of the landscape [50] that you want to understand, to intervene in, and to change its behavior. This is called sensemaking and it is \"a key leadership capability for the complex and dynamic world we live in today\" that enable leaders to \"explore the wider system, create a map of that system, and act in the system to learn from it\" [56] . It is the process of \"the making of sense\" [57] of an environment by \"structuring the unknown\" [58] by observing and structuring the inputs (signals, information, resources, etc.) to the system and the consequential behaviors and outputs as the inputs vary \"to comprehend, understand, explain, attribute, extrapolate, and predict\" [59] in order to prepare to intervene and measure the effects on an intervention in the system (Fig. 10a) .",

The interconnected quality of socio-economic political systems illustrates how, for example, a change in education will cause new behavior in nutrition. \u2022 No mitigation strategy for a wicked problem has a definitive scientific test because humans invented wicked problems and science exists to understand natural phenomena. \u2022 Offering a \"solution\" to a wicked problem frequently is a \"one shot\" design effort because a significant intervention changes the design space enough to minimize the ability for trial and error. \u2022 Every wicked problem is unique.",

            "text": "The theory of mental models rests on simple principles, and it extends in a natural way to inferring probabilities, to decision making, and to recursive reasoning about other people's reasoning. We can summarize the theory in terms of its principal predictions, which have all been corroborated experimentally. According to the model theory, everyday reasoning depends on the simulation of events in mental models (e.g., [65] ). The principal assumptions of the theory are: 1. Each model represents a possibility. Its structure corresponds to the structure of the world, but it has symbols for negation, probability, believability, and so on. Models that are kinematic or dynamic unfold in time to represent sequences of events. 2. Models are iconic insofar as possible, that is, their parts and relations correspond to those of the situations that they represent. They underlie visual images, but they also represent abstractions, and so they can represent the extensions of all sorts of relations. They can also be supplemented by symbolic elements to represent, for example, negation. 3. Models explain deduction, induction, and explanation. In a valid deduction, the conclusion holds for all models of the premises. In an induction, knowledge eliminates models of possibilities, and so the conclusion goes beyond the information given. In an abduction, knowledge introduces new concepts in order to yield an explanation. 4. The theory gives a 'dual process' account of reasoning. System 1 constructs initial models of premises and is restricted in computational power, i.e., it cannot carry out recursive inferences. System 2 can follow up the consequences of consequences recursively, and therefore search for counterexamples, where a counterexample is a model of the premises in which the conclusion does not hold. 5. The greater the number of alternative models needed, the harder it is: we take longer and are more likely to err, especially by overlooking a possibility. In the simulation of a sequence of events, the later in the sequence that a critical event occurs, the longer it will take us to make the inference about it. 6. The principle of truth: mental models represent only what is true, and accordingly they predict the occurrence of systematic and compelling fallacies if inferences depend on what is false. An analogous principle applies to the representation of what is possible 23 An excellent free interactive instruction on DSRP using the Plectica tool is available here: https:// cabrera-research-lab.tahoe.appsembler.com/ 24 An excellent introduction to Causal Loop Diagrams is available on the Systems and Us website at https://systemsandus.com/2012/08/15/learn-to-read-clds/ 25 An absolutely amazing, comprehensive and easy introduction to systems dynamic modeling (and other forms) is available from an open source free model simulation tool Insight Maker (https:// insightmaker.com/) whose tutorials explain the different modeling approaches very well. An accompanying ebook is available (http://beyondconnectingthedots.com/). Another gentle interactive introduction to systems dynamics is available here: https://kumu.io/stw/insight-maker using the mental modeling tool kumu https://kumu.io/ rather than impossible, to what is permissible rather than impermissible, and to other similar contrasts. 7. The meanings of terms such as 'if' can be modulated by content and knowledge. For example, our geographical knowledge modulates the disjunction: Jay is in Stockholm or he is in Sweden. Unlike most disjunctions, this one yields a definite conclusion: Jay is in Sweden.",

They are: There is an excellent series on systems thinking by Leyla Acaroglu on Systems Thinkers in her Disruptive Design 26 blogs. These 15 archetypes are described in one. 27 Gene Bellinger has developed individual short videos that explain these and many more archetypes that are available on YouTube. 28 These models become the testbed for using the different types of innovation described in the Forms of Innovation section. They also provide the framework for applying Meadows' 12 points of Intervention shown in Fig. 2 and discussed in her book [26] which she later expanded upon [67] (Fig. 10b ).",

For example, when the TV series Star Trek 4 was first aired in 1966 it exhibited two \"innovations\", the communicator and the transporter. While farfetched in 1966, the communicator was feasible and today most of us carry one around. In fact, Capt. Kirk was limited to using his to ask Scotty to \"beam me up\", Spock to inquire on the ships computer, Sulu as to where were the Klingons, and McCoy if the red shirt died yet. Our communicators not only allow us to communicate with each other, but have access to the knowledge of humanity, can tell us where we are and how to get to where we want to get to, and a myriad of other things. In fact, we have the entire non-weapons capabilities of the Enterprise in our hands. An innovation must be viable.
