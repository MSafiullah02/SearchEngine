Before the result came out, the patient was isolated and treated with Cefoperazone continuously.

However, SARS-CoV-2 PCR could not reflect viral load, and the sampling deviation added to the dissatisfactory sensitivity. Our case showed the ability of chest HRCT to recognize infected patient at the very early stage. Although we cannot completely exclude the possibility of bacterial superinfection to cause the GGO [2, 3] , considering the white cell/neutrophil depletion at the second blood test, the progression of lesions on CT after antimicrobial therapy did not support it. According to our case, patients with exposure to the epidemic area and suspicious HRCT findings should be isolated rigorously. Besides, since nasopharyngeal swab was reported to be more sensitivie than throat swab [4] , samples from multiple sites might be required to avoid sampling bias for PCR assay.",
