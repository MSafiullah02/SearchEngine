Cost-benefit analysis, cost-utility analysis, and cost-effectiveness measures are becoming increasingly common as measures of program success and continuance. Recognizing and understanding these measures and including them within the overall structure of a business plan helps public health professionals create new programs in areas of public health need, and allow the continuation of effective public health programs. Business plans can be used to develop new programs, lend support to existing programs, and prioritize ongoing programs by identifying those that are most successful. They can also help to increase the effectiveness of program delivery. Having experience with business plan development during graduate training helps to ensure that future public health professionals have the necessary skill set to develop the most successful programs possible. The act of developing a business plan helps the public health professional focus the program and identifies efficiencies. Furthermore, the conclusion of a business plan can determine the feasibility of the public health program. Identifying that the plan is not appropriate at a particular time due to financial, political, social, environmental, or other such constraints is valuable knowledge given limited financial resources.",

This requires students to be well informed about the core functions of public health, and use their understanding of epidemiological trends and the social determinants of health to determine factors that influence access to health services for their target population [1.1, 5.1]. While acknowledging population diversity when creating a business plan students confirm that they are able to ensure health inequities and negative unintended side effects of a proposed program are minimized [5.2]. It is recognized that the more specific the target, the greater the likelihood for success, as programs can be customized specifically for the intended audience. Analyzing trends and health outcomes, and determining underserviced populations allows students to identify gaps and limitations in current service delivery and organizational capacity [2.4], so that the most suitable program will be developed. Students report that additional analysis allows them to identify the gap that this program will close as recognized in the industry analysis. It also allows students to create a program that is culturally-relevant and appropriate for their given target population [5.3]. Quantitative information will include the size of the target audience and other such demographic information. Students seek published literature to determine how this audience receives information, how they accept information, as well as successful channels, promotions, and other methods that can effectively be used to reach this target market. Additional information is gathered through interviews and engagement with targeted individuals and other stakeholders. Students who have been able to work with a community agency throughout the whole process view this opportunity as valuable for retrieving this information.

Place is informed by work completed within the target market section identifying when, where, and how this particular target audience prefers to receive information to maximize success. Furthermore, the target market information informs the promotion which will also be impacted by budget as the amount of available resources as well as the type of promotion most accepted by the target market will influence this outcome.

Students develop an evaluation plan, ensuring that key data points are being collected from the inception of the program through to a future determined date. They also conduct an evaluability assessment of their program, ensuring that it can be evaluated. Outcome objectives can be used as key measuring points determining success. To be successful in the public health sector, students must also be able to demonstrate an ability to maintain organizational performance standards [7.5]. According to students, developing an evaluation plan provides them with an opportunity to create a framework of accountability to ensure that these standards are met or exceeded.",

Information such as budgets including best plan, most likely, and worst plan scenarios, and income statements allow them to further understand the flow of resources and the necessity to plan for future expenditures. In order to be successful, students recognize that they must use evidence and research to inform the financial aspects of the business plan [1.4]. They also suggest that the value of the financial plan goes beyond the use of the core competencies as it provides students with exposure to budgeting and finances in the public health sector prior to employment. Concepts such as various costing models, determining inventories, and the understanding of the generally accepted accounting principles will help students formulate budgets in the future. Having a well-developed financial plan allows students to demonstrate their ability to maximize outcomes and set and follow priorities based on available resources [3.7].",

Furthermore, protecting the organization\u2019s reputation is required, as the public health agency has advocated for the creation of this program and now will be looking at its conclusion. Exit strategies can be planned; that is, the agency will have entered into this program to start it up and bring partners and stakeholders in, and will then retreat allowing these partners to maintain its operation. Ideally, an exit strategy will recommend specific action to be put into practice relevant to the reason for the exit [2.6]. Students recall the opportunity to develop an exit strategy that includes a detailed account of how to take action so that the public health issue can continue to be addressed in the most appropriate manner [3.4]. They also recall that collaboration can play a significant role in planning for an exit, as partners may be required to take on greater responsibilities to ensure the needs of the target population are not left unanswered [4.1]. The program may be short lived as the problem may be acute and this information must be communicated to participants. As well, mitigating strategies will need to be devised in the plan of an unintentional exit where the organization must conclude its program due to lack of demand or lack of resources to support. Students report that planning for an unexpected event gives them practical experience in ensuring functional roles are fulfilled in the event of an unexpected occurrence [3.8]. Students agree that developing a sound exit strategy is an excellent way for them to further develop their competency with necessary collaboration and communication skills, and allows them to facilitate the reallocation of resources, and mediate the differing interests of involved parties while still maintaining organizational standards and public reputation [4.2, 4.3, 7.5]. Planning to communicate effectively with the target audience, as well as community stakeholders, colleagues, and partners is an essential component of a successful exit strategy that students consider to be valuable experience that adequately prepares graduates for real-world situations [6.1].",

The process involved in successfully completing the business plan begins before anything is put on paper with ample discussion about health problems and potential solutions. In order to adequately inform the discussion about the issue of concern, students agree that they must demonstrate their knowledge of the public health sciences within the appropriate contexts and be able to conceptualize these concepts in practice [1.1, 1.3, 2.5]. As well, students feel that extensive research may be involved in the selection of an issue, before groups begin to develop their plan of action [1.4]. Based on analysis of information and group discussion, students feel confident that the specific recommendations they provide are the most suitable solutions to the problem [2.6].",

Students recognize that it provides them with an avenue to present their own ideas, and work collaboratively with others to describe program options to address a specific issue, and discuss the implications of potential solutions [3.1, 3.2]. Working collaboratively to determine the most appropriate issue to be addressed can be a difficult task when students come from different backgrounds, and have differing interests. As a result, students came to the conclusion that working in a group setting provides them with an opportunity to advocate for health policies, programs, and services that best promote and protect the health and well-being of the public, as will be required of them when employed in the public health sector [4.4]. Not only does collaboration with classmates provide students with an experience more reminiscent of public health practice, it allows them to effectively demonstrate their leadership skills. Students eluded to the fact that by contributing their own ideas and debating the ideas of others, they are able to effectively build public health workforce capacity by sharing their own knowledge and expertise and enhancing the learning of classmates to advance public health goals [7.6, 7.4]. As a whole, these experiences lay the foundation for students to continually pursue learning opportunities in the field of public health throughout their career [1.5].",

Ensuring that the process of creating a business plan is a collective learning partnership between faculty, public health practitioners, and students will be beneficial for all involved parties [1]. Students who worked closely with community agencies to develop their business plan, were able to develop a more comprehensive and realistic program plan. Moving forward, all groups of students will work with a community agency to create a business plan that will be used in practice. Working with organizations to develop programs based on identified need take competencies covered in the business plan one step further, from theoretical to applied. Students who engaged in two-way knowledge exchange with community agencies to complete the business plan felt that they were able to accelerate their learning as they are able to build community capacity and contribute to developing key values and a shared vision in program planning within the community [7.6, 7.2]. At the same time, they were able to provide a significant benefit for community agencies, as the partnerships facilitate program development in areas with limited capacity. Future research will involve measuring the specific competencies gained by students through the business planning exercise, as well as the impact greater community collaboration will have on the acceleration and enhancement of proficiency.",

Students agree that in order to successfully complete the business planning exercise, they are required to review epidemiological evidence, identify and analyze relevant information from multiple sources, and partake in stakeholder engagement, demonstrating their ability to engage in evidence-informed decision-making. Further, the financial component of a business plan allows them exposure to budgeting and financial concepts in a public health setting. This provides real-world experience that will aid in cost-benefit analysis, and developing administrative and organizational structures including implementation plans, as they undertake managerial tasks into the future. As the development of programs becomes more restricted and the continuation of other programs are under constant threat, the ability to develop a sound business plan is a required skill for individuals entering the public health sector, and ensures scarce resource consumption will have the biggest impact within the health of our communities.",

By bringing all of their knowledge together to create a single deliverable, students are able to validate their learning in the MPH program. The attitudes and values of public health professionals are an important component of effective practice, and business planning allows students to apply the public health problem-solving paradigm to evaluate and address a real-life public health problem. Coming up with a comprehensive and feasible solution requires a significant amount of time and effort, thus students assume ownership of the plan and become invested in the outcome. This desire for program success to effectively build capacity to respond to a given health issue, combined with the unique opportunity for students to demonstrate knowledge of all of the essential building blocks of public health practice, makes the business planning exercise an ideal capstone project for MPH programs in Canada and adequately prepares students for a successful future in the public health sector.",
