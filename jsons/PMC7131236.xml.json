            "text": "Vaccination is considered one of the greatest medical interventions in human history. After clean water, vaccines have provided the second most important mechanism to combat and eliminate infectious diseases. The first vaccination, or variolation in the case of smallpox, took place back in the early 18th century and paved the way for the development of the first smallpox vaccine using cowpox. By the end of the 19th century, scientists had already discovered that the administration of attenuated or inactivated pathogens resulted in protection against the disease caused by the pathogen. Throughout the 20th century, attenuation and inactivation led to the development of multiple vaccines not only against bacterial pathogens (cholera, typhoid, pertussis, and tuberculosis to name a few), but also against viral pathogens such as rabies and polio. If we consider these achievements to be the first stage of vaccine development, then the second stage began in the 1980s with the advent of subunit vaccines, conjugation, and DNA recombinant vaccines. These technologies have successfully brought about the development of vaccines against Haemophilus influenzae, pneumococcus, meningococcus, hepatitis B, and\u2013most recently\u2013 papillomavirus [1].",

            "text": "Even though we have seen tremendous achievements in the field of vaccinology in the past decades, there are still challenges to be faced when designing vaccination strategies and developing new vaccines. We continue to use a public health paradigm of \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d approach, a method that fails to recognize not only pathogen variability, but also host variability. The 21st century has new tools available that can help us create improved vaccines and vaccination strategies. Current advances in immunology, immunogenetics, immunogenomics, systems biology, bioinformatics, and personalized medicine can facilitate the establishment of a third stage of vaccinology, implementing a personalized approach [2]. Moreover, improved vaccination strategies must be in place for specific populations with increased susceptibility to infection, such as the elderly (immunosenescence) and infants (e.g., maternal immunization for the prevention of pertussis [3] and invasive Group B streptococcus disease [4] in neonates).",

Such rapid development can be achieved by employing well-characterized platform technologies such as the replication-deficient simian adenovirus model, which could be used to develop vaccines against Rift Valley Fever virus and MERS-CoV [5]. Moreover, outbreaks of emerging pathogens further underscore the importance of establishing extensive partnerships between global health organizations, government agencies, clinical researchers, funding organizations, and vaccine developers who all worked together toward the rapid development of the V920 Ebola vaccine [6].",
