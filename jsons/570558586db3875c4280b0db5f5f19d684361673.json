Till today (22 May 2020, 10:20 PM) the number of COVID-19 positive cases have increased to 67,719 with 364 deaths due to this disease. 1 The control of communicable diseases depends to a large extent on the knowledge, attitudes, practices, and behavior of the local population. 6 The strict observance of precautionary measures to avoid its spread to the masses is key to control the disease. Mass media is the major source of spreading different myths regarding prevention and resistance against the disease. The practicing behavior and knowledge of the general public carry the most important bearing in the war against COVID-19. Assessing the gap in general public misconceptions, knowledge, attitudes, and practice behaviors are always advantageous for developing future policies towards such pandemic situations. 7 People have been overburdened by the influx of information from different resources, especially by the SM; thus, they are confused and anxious to find accurate knowledge . 8, 9 The present survey explored the predictors of misconceptions, knowledge, attitudes, and practices of the COVID-19 pandemic among a sample of the Saudi population. We also assessed their approach towards the overall impact of this problem. Our results would help to update the awareness campaigns accordingly.",

The convenience sample technique was used, and participants were approached by SM (Facebook, Whatsapp, Twitter, and others), and an online questionnaire was administered, and no monetary benefit was offered to any participants. At the beginning of the online questionnaire, a brief description of the research was given, and a request for their participation. Participants agreed to fill the online questionnaire was considered their consent for participation in the survey. The questionnaire was constructed with the help of the WHO myth-buster document and a published study. 10 , 11 The questionnaire was translated, and back-translated (English-Arabic) by two bilingual experts' and the questionnaire was modified according to their suggestions. Two senior faculty members validated the questionnaire. A pilot study on 35 people from the general public was done to find out the convenience and comprehension of the questionnaire and its Cronbach's alpha was .81. This questionnaire was converted to a google document containing English and Arabic translation. We kept both languages together so that everybody can fill the questionnaire according to its convenience.

Malaysian and Chinese studies have also reported a very positive attitude among participants for similar questions. 8, 11 The high-level positive attitude in our study may be attributed to an excellent campaign for the awareness of the Saudi population by the MOH. They are sending daily awareness messages on mobile phones in different languages and have launched a mobile application to identify the symptoms of the corona. Newspapers and television are also disseminating information regarding preventive measures. Such a good attitude among people was also attributed to the government's efforts to mitigate the virus transmission by Chinese and Malaysian studies. 8, 11 The Saudi nationality was the predictor of participants' positive attitude, while the male gender and divorced ones were predictors of a negative attitude. One of the reasons could be a better living style and exposure to awareness campaigns on SM and local TV networks by Saudi nationals. Most of the expatriates belonged to the working class, and they were not highly educated. Hence, they had relatively insufficient knowledge regarding the disease as compared to Saudi nationals, which is also reflected in their attitude. Interestingly this finding has also been highlighted in other studies that females show more concern and positivity towards any infectious epidemic for their families and society. 28, 29 Education and marriage modify individual's responses resulting in responsible attitude and overall positiveness, 30 so was observed in our study with some exceptions. One interesting finding, the divorced status was associated with a careless and rather negative attitude towards .
