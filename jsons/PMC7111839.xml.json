            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) has become a priority for healthcare agencies around the world given its communicability, associated mortality, and the potential for pandemic spread. As of 31 July 2003, 8,098 SARS cases had been identified worldwide, resulting in 774 deaths and a mortality rate of about 9.6% (World Health Organization statistics). SARS is now known to result from infection with a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (Drosten et al., 2003, Ksiazek et al., 2003, Peiris et al., 2003). Evidence that SARS-CoV is the etiologic agent of SARS follows an experimental infection of macaques (Macaca fascicularis), fulfilling Koch's postulates (Fouchier et al., 2003). The clinical manifestations of SARS are hardly distinct from other common respiratory viral infections, including influenza. Because influenza epidemics might occur simultaneously with the eventual re-emergence of SARS, an effective SARS vaccine is urgently required, as well as more sensitive diagnostic tests specific for SARS.",

            "text": "Structural characterization of SARS-CoV and characterization of its complete RNA genome (Marra et al., 2003, Rota et al., 2003, Ruan et al., 2003) have provided us with the opportunity to develop a SARS vaccine. Like other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV is a plus-stranded RNA virus with a 30-kb genome encoding replicase gene products and the 4 structural proteins; i.e., spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) (Marra et al., 2003, Rota et al., 2003). The S protein is thought to be involved in receptor binding, while the E protein has a role in viral assembly, the M protein is important for virus budding, and the N protein has a role in viral RNA packaging (for review, see reference (Holmes, 2003)). Recently, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been identified as a cellular receptor for SARS-CoV (Li et al., 2003). Thus, the first step of infection likely involves binding of S protein to the ACE2 receptor. In a model of MHV infection, S protein is known to contain important virus-neutralizing epitopes that elicit neutralizing antibody responses in mice (Collins et al., 1982). Therefore, the S protein of coronavirus might be manipulated to induce immunity. However, S, M, and N proteins are also known to contribute to the host immune response (Anton et al., 1996, Jackwood and Hilt, 1995). A DNA vaccine encoding the S glycoprotein of the SARS-CoV induces T cell and neutralizing antibody responses, as well as protective immunity, in a mouse model (Yang et al., 2004). Vaccination with a plasmid expressing N protein is capable of generating strong N-specific humoral and T-cell-mediated immune responses in vaccinated C57BL/6 mice (Kim et al., 2004, Zhao et al., 2005, Zhu et al., 2004). In addition, N-specific CD8+ T cells provide protective immunity against some coronaviruses (Collisson et al., 2000, Seo et al., 1997).",

These rDIs vaccines were administered to mice either subcutaneously or intranasally, and the humoral and cellular immunity against SARS-CoV in vaccinated mice were analyzed.

Expression of SARS-CoV N and S proteins in chick embryo fibroblast (CEF) cells infected with rDIsSARS was detected by Western blotting using monoclonal antibodies (Fig. 2A) (Ohnishi et al., 2005). Purified SARS-CoV virion was used as a positive control (Fig. 2A, lane PC). A robust signal was detected at 50 kDa, corresponding to the N protein of SARS-CoV, as predicted by its genomic size (Marra et al., 2003, Rota et al., 2003). A band approaching 200 kDa likely corresponds to the S protein, which is known to be heavily glycosylated (Fig. 2A). Our results are consistent with data reported by Xiao et al. (2003) who expressed the full-length S glycoprotein of SARS-CoV Tor2 strain in 293 cells and demonstrated a protein approaching 180\u2013200 kDa by SDS gel electrophoresis. Concerning the M protein, only a smear band in the stacking gel was detected using a polyclonal antibody against synthetic peptide of the M protein (Mizutani et al., 2004), presumably because it formed large oligomers with SDS-resistance in cells (Fig. 2A). Similar result was mentioned by the analysis of the M protein of SARS-CoV (Buchholz et al., 2004) and infectious bronchitis virus (Weisz et al., 1993).",

Thus, our results, consistent with others (Bisht et al., 2004, Buchholz et al., 2004, Yang et al., 2004), indicate that the S protein is a prerequisite for eliciting a sufficient IgG antibody response for neutralization. Similar neutralizing activity was obtained in mice receiving S alone or in combination with other components. Therefore, we expected that the rDIsSARS expressing E/M/N/S proteins in combination could be the best vaccine candidate among others.",

As shown in Fig. 4A, substantial levels of anti-SARS-CoV IgA were detected only in mice received intranasal inoculation of rDIsSARS-E/M/N/S, compared to those inoculated with parental DIs (P = 0.0010). The level of IgA detected in intranasally rDIsSARS-E/M/N/S-inoculated mice was similar to that observed following intranasal immunization with UV-inactivated, purified SARS-CoV virion (positive control). On the other hand, subcutaneous injection of all forms of rDIsSARS produced only slightly higher levels of IgA than those observed in DIs -injected control mice. Therefore, the results indicated that the subcutaneous route of injection is inefficient, especially when mucosal IgA response is required.",

One week after final inoculation, the mice were challenged intranasally with 104 tissue culture 50% infectious dose (TCID50) of SARS-CoV. The results were shown in Fig. 4D. In mice inoculated with saline, 103 TCID50/ml of SARS-CoV were recovered from lung wash fluid on day 3. In contrast, titers of SARS-CoV from the lungs of mice subcutaneously immunized with rDIsSARS-E/M/S or rDIsSARS-E/M/N/S were below the limits of detection. The same was true for mice intranasally immunized with rDIsSARS-E/M/N/S, whereas the virus was recovered in mice similarly immunized with rDIsSARS-E/M/S. Taken into consideration of a relatively low or marginal level of mucosal IgA antibody in mice intranasally immunized with rDIsSARS-E/M/N/S or rDIsSARS-E/M/S, or even no IgA response by subcutaneous route as described above, it was suggested that mucosal IgG antibody, but not IgA antibody, likely contributed to the protective immunity, especially in mice simultaneously immunized with recombinant rDIsSARS-E/M/N/S.",

In a previous study of coronaviruses, S protein was shown to play an important role in viral pathogenesis, as well as induction of protective immunity (Holmes, 2003). In order to assess the ability of rDIsSARS to induce SARS-CoV S-specific T cells, T cells from axillary lymph nodes (ALN), superficial cervical lymph nodes (CLN) and spleens of mice subcutaneously immunized with rDIsSARS-S or DIs were isolated and stimulated in vitro with UV-inactivated, purified SARS-CoV virion. Culture supernatant was collected 4 days later, and the levels of interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3), interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, IL-5 and tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) were measured. T cells in ALN produced the greatest cytokine levels (Fig. 5\n, and data not shown). This is not surprising in light of the subcutaneous route of immunization. Notably, mice immunized with rDIsSARS-S produced a high level of IFN-\u03b3  upon in vitro stimulation with UV-inactivated, purified SARS-CoV virion. The production of TNF-\u03b1,  an inflammatory cytokine, was significantly elevated in T cells in ALN of rDIsSARS-S immunized mice after in vitro stimulation with virion antigens. However, TNF-\u03b1 production was observed also in mice immunized with parental DIs without in vitro stimulation with virion antigens. Since T cells from the lymph nodes of na\u00efve mice did not produce cytokines even after in vitro stimulation with virion antigens (data not shown), it is possible that injection of DIs induces mild local inflammation, even when viral proliferation does not occur at the injection site. The pattern of IL-2, IL-5 and IL-4 production were similar to that of IFN-\u03b3, and the maximum level of these cytokines in ALN T cells from rDIsSARS-S-immunized mice were 254, 227 and 88 ng/ml, respectively.",

We carried out IFN-\u03b3 enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) analysis using four 20-mer peptides corresponding to the ACE2 binding region of the S protein selected using the SYFPEITHI score (S44-47), as well as overlapping 20-mer peptides pool covering a whole N protein. When the splenic T cells of mice were analyzed following intranasal or subcutaneous immunization with the most potent vaccine, rDIsSARS-E/M/N/S, a high level of reactivity against S46 was observed especially in the T cells of subcutaneously immunized mice (Fig. 6A). Zhi et al. recently identified a CD4+ T cell epitope, known as NYNYKYRYL, in BALB/c mice (Zhi et al., 2005). S46 contains this sequence, thus, these IFN-\u03b3-producing T cells are likely CD4+ T cells. To detect N-specific T cells, mice subcutaneously or intranasally immunized with rDIsSARS-N were analyzed by ELISPOT. In this case, ten peptides were pooled from amino-terminus of N protein, resulting in 5 pools of peptides. We thus detected N-reactive T cells capable of recognizing the first 10 peptides pool (Fig. 6B), and observed a greater proportion of N-specific T cells following nasal immunization than subcutaneous immunization. These results indicate that S- and N-specific T cells are generated systemically by rDIs.",

Expression of S protein on the S6.2 clone was confirmed by FACS analysis using anti-SARS S monoclonal antibody (Fig. 7A). An empty vector transfectant, BOS-5, was used as a negative control APC. Subcutaneous and intranasal immunization with the most potent rDIsSARS-E/M/N/S generated a significant level of S-specific T cells (Fig. 7B), and a dramatic decrease in S-specific T cells was observed following partial depletion of CD8+ T cells (Fig. 7C). Therefore, rDIsSARS-E/M/N/S was able to induce both SARS-CoV-reactive CD4+ and CD8+ T cells.",

Slight migration of inflammatory cells and mild disruption of the bronchial epithelium were detected in lung tissue of mock-vaccinated mice. SARS-CoV antigens were diffusely observed within the bronchial and alveolar epithelium. In contrast, significant lymphocytic infiltration into peribronchial sites, with little to no detection of SARS-CoV antigens, was observed in mice intranasally immunized with rDIsSARS-E/M/S or rDIsSARS-E/M/N/S (Fig. 8). The infiltrating lymphocytes were found to be CD3-positive T-cells, as determined by immunohistochemistry with anti-CD3 antibody (Fig. 8). On the other hand, intranasal or subcutaneous immunization by only N-expressing DIs induced neither T-cell infiltration nor protective immunity against SARS-CoV, despite of the induction of N-specific antibodies and T cells. These results suggest that marked induction of T-cell response in mice immunized with rDIsSARS-E/M/S and rDIsSARS-E/M/N/S help to eliminate SARS-CoV from the lung tissue. On the other hand, intranasal or subcutaneous immunization by only N-expressing DIs did not induce protective immunity against SARS-CoV, despite of the induction of N-specific antibodies and T cells. Thus, rDIs expressing the S protein, along with other membrane components (E/M and E/M/N), are capable of inducing strong immunity of both humoral and cellular arms and are fully competent to clear SARS-CoV infection.",

The DIs-derived recombinant viruses express high levels of viral and inserted genes, even in non-permissive cell lines without any cytopathic effects (Ishii et al., 2002). In earlier studies, MVA strain of vaccinia virus, which is also replication-incompetent in most mammal cells, was used to express a variety of foreign genes and some of these recombinant viruses were studied as candidate vaccine vectors and appeared to be more effective than many replication-competent vaccinia virus vaccines (Sutter and Moss, 1992, Sutter et al., 1994, Belyakov et al., 1998, Nam et al., 1999, Stittelaar et al., 2000). rDIs does not replicate nor produce infectious virions in most mammalian cells, therefore the DIs strain has a safety advantage when used as a recombinant vaccine vector as for MVA. Recently, a recombinant DIs, rDIsSIVGag, expressing a full-length gag gene of SIV, was developed, and demonstrated to have a potential for use as an HIV/AIDS vaccine (Someya et al., 2004).",

DNA vaccines (Kim et al., 2004, Yang et al., 2004, Zhu et al., 2004, Zhao et al., 2005) and viral vectors such as vaccinia virus (Bisht et al., 2004, Weingartl et al., 2004), parainfluenza virus (Bukreyev et al., 2004), adenovirus (Zakhartchouk et al., 2005) and rhabdoviruses (Faber et al., 2005, Kapadia et al., 2005) are used as recombinant vaccines. Yang et al. (2004) showed that viral replication was reduced by more than six orders of magnitude in the lungs of mice vaccinated with these S plasmid DNA expression vectors, and protection was mediated by a humoral but not a T-cell-dependent immune mechanism. Bisht et al. (2004) showed that inoculation of BALB/c mice with a recombinant MVA expressing SARS-CoV S protein elicited serum antibodies to SARS-CoV S protein and protective immunity against SARS-CoV infection. Previous studies demonstrated passive transfer of serum from immunized mice conferred protection against SARS-CoV in the respiratory tract following inoculation with either SARS CoV or recombinant MVA expressing S protein (Bisht et al., 2004, Subbarao et al., 2004). These results suggest that S protein is a crucial antigen in generating protective immunity. We observed that intranasal or subcutaneous inoculation of BALB/c mice with rDIs expressing S protein (rDIsSARS-S, rDIsSARS-E/M/S or rDIsSARS-E/M/N/S) produced serum antibodies capable of recognizing the SARS-CoV virion by ELISA, also capable of neutralizing SARS-CoV in vitro. The subcutaneous route appears to elicit stronger immunity than intranasal immunization with respect to the level of anti-SARS-CoV IgG antibody produced. Important finding here is that although the mucosal IgA antibody response was induced only in mice intranasally immunized with rDIsSARS-E/M/N/S, the mice administered with rDIsSARS-E/M/N/S by either route elicited strong protective immunity. Therefore, the protection was achieved in the absence of a mucosal IgA response in mice subcutaneously immunized with rDIsSARS-E/M/N/S. Thus, our results clearly show that mucosal infection might be prevented in the presence of a high level of neutralizing serum IgG antibody. Control mice vaccinated with DIs not expressing envelope proteins were not protected, indicating that the effect was specific for the expressed envelope proteins of SARS-CoV and was not due to enhanced nonspecific immunity.",

The expression of S with the two other putative virion envelope proteins, M and E protein, did not augment the neutralizing antibody response. In the absence of S, expression of M and E, or the nucleocapsid protein N, did not induce a detectable serum SARS-CoV-neutralizing antibody response (Buchholz et al., 2004).

            "text": "Histopathological analysis of lung tissues in the present study revealed a marked lymphocytic infiltration in peribronchial sites in mice immunized intranasally or subcutaneously with recombinant vaccinia virus DIs expressing E/M/S or E/M/N/S. Almost no SARS-CoV antigens were detected in these areas upon immunohistochemical analysis. The infiltrating lymphocytes were shown to be CD3 positive T-cells. This is the first evidence of induction of protective immunity against SARS-CoV associated with marked infiltration of T cells at a SARS-CoV infection site. We were able to detect SARS-CoV S-specific CD8+ T cells in the spleen of these immunized mice by INF-\u03b3 ELISPOT. Thus, these results suggest that T cell induction in mice immunized with rDIsSARS-E/M/S and rDIsSARS-E/M/N/S might provide additional help to completely eliminate SARS-CoV in the lung. Of note, Weingartl et al. (2004) reported a low level of neutralizing antibody response in ferrets (Mustela putorius furo) immunized with a recombinant MVA expressing SARS-CoV S protein. They also showed that there are more rapid and vigorous neutralizing antibody responses in immunized ferrets, compared to control animals after challenge with SARS-CoV. However, SARS-CoV infection and spreading in the immunized ferrets is not prevented. Moreover, upon infection with SARS-CoV, strong inflammatory responses were noted in ferrets immunized with either recombinant MVA expressing SARS-CoV S or N protein, suggesting that vaccination with the recombinant MVA expressing SARS-CoV S or N protein may, in some case, lead to enhanced pathology during SARS-CoV infection (Czub et al., 2005, Weingartl et al., 2004). It was also reported that antibodies that neutralized most human SARS-CoV S enhanced entry mediated by the civet virus S, suggesting the possibility that such kind of vaccines might enhance viral infection (Yang et al., 2005). Although we observed no such pathology in rDIs-immunized mice after virus challenge, the potential for widespread tissue damage following administration of SARS-CoV proteins should be carefully investigated. In addition, further studies are required to clarify whether the recruited T-cells indeed play an important role in clearance of SARS-CoV from sites of infection.",

S peptides S44 (S331\u2013350), S45 (S381\u2013400), S46 (S431\u2013450), and S47 (S481\u2013500) corresponding to the ACE2 binding region of the S protein were selectively produced based on a web-site program by SYFPEITHI (http://syfpeithi.de/). A20.2J murine B cells irradiated at 2000 cGy were used as APCs with peptides corresponding to either S or N proteins. In some experiments, A20.2J cells stably transfected with pEF-S or the empty vector pEF-BOS were used.",

After the plates were washed, biotinylated detection antibody was added, then the plates were further incubated for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C. The plates were washed three times with PBST, then 50 \u03bcl/well of Streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase-conjugated anti-biotin immunoglobulin G solution was added, followed by incubation for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C. After washing with PBST, substrate mix (50 \u03bcl/well) was added, and the plates were allowed to develop over 4 h at 37 \u00b0C.
