Medical professionals supporting trauma need to balance rapid interventions, including intubation, manual ventilation, chest tube placement, and other invasive procedures, against the risk of exposure. This applies not only to anesthesiologists but also all medical professionals providing care for the trauma patient. 3, 4 The need to preserve our highly skilled workforce must be emphasized even in settings where time to interventions is critical.",

While the risk of transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 remains theoretical, donor centers are excluding symptomatic individuals or potential donors with known or potential close contact with a person with COVID-19. 5 Current recommendations are that these individuals should refrain from donating until at least 28 days after resolution of symptoms or last contact, respectively. The real threat, however, is not from the virus itself, but from the impact of social distancing on blood collection, as donor centers might be closed, and prospective donors might choose to remain home. 6 Many institutions have implemented blood conservation programs affecting blood availability, transfusion triggers, and massive transfusion events. In specific cases, this might require a discussion among the care team regarding the utility of ongoing resuscitative efforts due to concerns about diverting resources that might benefit other patients. Gong et al 2 acknowledge that increased attention to blood conservation practices might be necessary to minimize difficult decisions.",
