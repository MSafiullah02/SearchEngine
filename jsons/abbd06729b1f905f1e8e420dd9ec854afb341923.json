Subjects characteristics are listed in Table 1. SARS-CoV-2-IgG antibodies were detected in 5 of 316 (1.6%) subjects. Out of these, 3 of 244 (1.2%) subjects belonging to the high-risk group and in 2 of 37 (5.4%) belonging to the intermediaterisk group. The seroprevalence was higher in the intermediate-risk vs. high-risk group with an odds ratio of 0.22 (confidence interval 95% 0.04-1.35; p=0.13). No participant of the control group tested positive for SARS-CoV-2-IgG antibodies. The mean S/CO-value was 2.7 +/-1.4 and did not differ significantly between groups (table 1). Four of the five subjects (80%) with detectable antibodies reported COVID-19 associated symptoms in the past 3 months including headache (40%) and sneezing (40%). General malaise, anosmia and fever were observed in just one case each. None of the subjects suffered from cough, sore throat or dyspnea. One of the five subjects (20%) had no symptoms at all. None of the subjects were hospitalized. The transmission route could not be elucidated in all cases: Three subjects had suspected infection after unprotected professional COVID-19 exposure and in two cases the route of infection is unknown. PCR of a nasopharyngeal swab was performed in 4 out of the 5 cases without SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection.DiscussionThe aim of this study was to determine the SARS-CoV-2 seroprevalence in healthcare workers of the University Hospital Essen, Germany. In 5 of 316 (1.6%) healthcare workers antibodies could be detected. The seroprevalence was lower in the high-risk group vs. intermediate-risk p=0.13). No participant of the low-risk group tested positive for SARS-CoV-2-IgG antibodies. These findings reveal the overall seroprevalence is low, which corresponds to another study from the Santa Clara County, United States with approximately 3500 subjects and a seroprevalence of 1.5%[9]. Other studies observe higher infection rates in healthcare workers. In a study of 957 employees in another German tertiary hospital 52 (5.4%) employees tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 PCR. The authors underline the vulnerability of healthcare workers in the ongoing pandemic. Similar findings were observed in a Dutch study of 1353 healthcare workers of whom 86 (6%) were tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 via nasal swab[10]. Interestingly the authors suppose the infection to be community acquired during the early phase of pandemic. An even higher rate of infection of healthcare workers was observed in a study from the United Kingdom byKeeley et al.,  where 1533 symptomatic healthcare workers",
