At 2 months of age, a cardiac catheterization demonstrated suprasystemic right heart pressures that were mildly responsive to inhaled nitric oxide. He was discharged home on nasal cannula oxygen (0.5 L/minute) and nitric oxide (0.5 L/minute; estimated 5 parts per million). His oxygen and nitric oxide requirements gradually increased, and his pulmonary hypertension worsened, prompting bilateral lung transplantation at 21 months of age. He did well until 4 years of age, when he required a second transplant for chronic lung allograft dysfunction owing to rejection. He is alive at 16 years of age with bronchiolitis obliterans. Most recent (15 years) spirometry revealed forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1) of 31% predicted, forced vital capacity (FVC) of 40% predicted, and FEV1/FVC of 68% indicating airflow obstruction (no response in FEV1 to bronchodilator therapy).

In contrast with the classic neonatal presentation of ACDMPV, only 3 subjects (1, 2, and 6) had respiratory symptoms in the newborn period. Two infants (subjects 1 and 6) were treated with nasal cannula oxygen that was discontinued by 3 weeks of life, and then presented with fulminant symptoms at 3 and 7 months, respectively. The third infant (subject 2) had a persistent oxygen requirement and echocardiographic evidence of pulmonary hypertension that prompted diagnostic lung biopsy at 1 month of age. Although this infant had the earliest presentation, biopsy, and diagnosis, he underwent lung transplant at the oldest age (DOL 633) and required the least respiratory support at the time of transplantation (supplemental nasal cannula oxygen and nitric oxide). His explant histology demonstrated focal findings, which may have contributed to his comparatively indolent course. The remaining 3 subjects had no significant respiratory symptoms within the first 2-3 months of life, including the infant with a family history of ACDMPV (subject 3). Because of the wide variability and timing of presentations, atypical ACDMPV should remain in the differential diagnosis of any infant with hypoxemia and idiopathic pulmonary hypertension.",

Although our study is limited in that explant histology may be confounded by differences in pretransplant treatment (mechanical ventilation, prolonged oxygen exposure) and chronologic age, the nonuniformity of histopathologic characteristics suggests that disruption of lung development in this disease is location specific and may be influenced by the local cellular and growth factor milieu. It is important to note that all 6 explants had areas of lung with normal capillary loops, a finding that illustrates the challenge of making a diagnosis of ACDMPV on a single specimen lung biopsy for patients with atypical presentations. Because point mutations or CNV deletions that involve FOXF1 are present in approximately 80%-90% of infants with classic ACDMPV10 and 3 of 5 infants tested in our series, diagnostic sequencing of FOXF1 may preclude the need for lung biopsy.25 Failure to identify FOXF1 point mutations or CNV deletions in 2 of the 5 subjects tested suggests that other genes may contribute to or modify the ACDMPV phenotype.10\n",

Medial wall hypertrophy, although present, was less pronounced among the 3 infants with classic ACDMPV (Table IV). It is unclear whether this difference reflects a primary process related to endothelial cell proliferation or is secondary to therapies or chronic/prolonged disruption of the pulmonary vascular bed. For 5 atypical ACDMPV infants, the severity of their pulmonary hypertension contributed to the eventual need for intensive medical and mechanical respiratory support before transplantation. Presumably, their pulmonary hypertension resulted from an anatomically fixed, decreased number of pulmonary capillaries within the alveolar epithelium, misaligned pulmonary veins, and abnormal lobular development. Although neonates with classic ACDMPV typically have transient but nonsustained responses to pulmonary vasodilators,1 3 atypical ACDMPV infants (subjects 2, 4, and 6) demonstrated a reduction in pulmonary resistance with inhaled nitric oxide administration during cardiac catheterization, and successful treatment of all 6 infants with pulmonary vasodilators suggests pharmacologically reversible components of pulmonary hypertension. However, our study was not specifically designed to determine the effects of these therapies thereby limiting this finding. The usefulness of these medications among infants with atypical ACDMPV compared with classic ACDMPV may reflect in part the heterogeneous nature of their disease or the diversity of the underlying biologic or developmental mechanisms.",

In contrast with infants with atypical ACDMPV, infants with idiopathic primary pulmonary hypertension typically are not hypoxemic without a significant intracardiac shunt and usually do not have abnormalities of the pulmonary parenchyma on chest CT.26 Infants with biallelic loss of function mutations in surfactant proteins (SFTPB, ABCA3) typically present with severe neonatal respiratory distress syndrome and have chest radiograph findings consistent with surfactant deficiency.27 Infants with dominant point mutations in SFTPC or missense variants in ABCA3 can present beyond the newborn period with childhood ILD and pulmonary hypertension, which when present, is associated with increased mortality.28 The presentation of pulmonary venoocclusive disease and pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis with hypoxemia, pulmonary hypertension, and abnormal CT scan results (patchy centrilobular pattern of ground glass opacities, pavement appearance to lobules) can make differentiation from ACDMPV potentially difficult. Owing to the wide variability and timing of presentations, atypical ACDMPV should remain in the differential diagnosis of any infant with hypoxemia and idiopathic pulmonary hypertension including those with chest CT findings of ILD; clinical testing of FOFX1 in these patients may be diagnostic.",
