In general, respiratory droplet spread can occur only through direct contact or at close distance (approximately 1 m), is less efficient, and has a lag time between generations of cases that is influenced by the incubation period and the infectious period, whereas in airborne spread, many cases can be affected within a short period of time by a common source and at distances much greater than 2 m.",

A substantial number of cases also occurred in residential buildings near the Amoy Gardens (n = 103). In the Lower Ngau Tau Kok Estate (LNTKE), a public housing estate with 14 large apartment buildings, 48 cases were reported. All but 1 case concentrated in the 7 buildings (blocks 8-14) situated directly downwind (southwest) from blocks A-G of Amoy Gardens. To the west of the LNTKE, across a major highway and railroad, is a huge residential complex (Telford Gardens) comprising 41 buildings where 6 cases were reported, 5 of which were from buildings directly facing LNTKE. Furthermore, 14 cases were reported in another private housing estate (Lee Kee Building) with 4 buildings about 30 m northwest of buildings C and D of Amoy Gardens. The next housing estate (Wang Kwong Building) in the northwest direction with 3 buildings reported 8 cases. Farther northwest, 3 cases were reported from the next housing estate of 3 buildings (Jade Field Gardens) and 5 cases from the last housing estate with 8 buildings (Tak Bo Gardens) in that direction (about 200 m from block E of Amoy Gardens).

The prevailing northeasterly wind at the time could explain the spread to LNTKE and then Telford Gardens on the west/southwest of blocks A-G of Amoy Gardens. The spread to the residential buildings located to the north/northwest was in line with our earlier computational fluid dynamics modeling that showed a portion of the hypothetical virus-laden plume passing through the space between blocks C and D and spreading toward the northwest [2] . No cases occurred during the period 24-29 March in the 2 housing estates (Kai Tai Court and Kai Yip Estate) about 300 m northwest of Telford Gardens, which suggested that the spread through the wind did not extend that far, possibly due to too much dilution over the distance. Considering that cases in Telford Gardens and Tak Bo Garden with symptom onset during 24-29 March were most likely resulting from the common source originating in block E of Amoy Gardens, the distance of airborne transmission in that outbreak could be >200 m.",
