The structures of sialic acids, comprising a family of over 40 neuraminic acid derivatives, have been elucidated. However, many aspects of the regulation of their metabolism at the enzyme and gene levels, as well as of their functions remain mysterious. Sialic acids play a dual role, not only are they indispensable for the protection to and adaptation of life, but are also utilised by lifethreatening infectious microorganisms. In this article the present state of knowledge in sialobiology, with an emphasis on my personal experience in this research area, is outlined including a discussion of necessary future work in this fascinating \u00aeeld of cell biology.",

            "text": "Alfred Gottschalk, who wrote the \u00aerst book on sialic acids (Sia) [1] and investigated the carbohydrate composition of sialic acid-rich mammalian mucins, introduced me to this \u00aeeld in the 1960s and pointed to the novelty of carbohydrate research in biological systems by saying``we are just at the shores of an unexplored continent''. He not only had coined, together with Gunnar Blix and Ernst Klenk, the term``sialic acid'' [2] , but had also obtained early insight into the great biological signi\u00aecance of this monosaccharide family, for example, the observation of an antiproteolytic effect in developing frog eggs (reviewed in [3] ). Earlier, Ernst Klenk introduced the name``neuraminic acid'' to a substance, which he had isolated after methanolysis of gangliosides and which we now know as neuraminic acid-b-methyl glycoside [4] . The main achievement of Gunnar Blix was to crystallize, for the \u00aerst time in 1936, this incidentally being the year of my birth, several Sia species hydrolytically released from bovine submandibular gland mucin [5] . Stimulated by this promising \u00aeeld of research I gladly accepted a post-doctoral position at the newly founded Ruhr-University in Bochum in the laboratory of Hans Faillard and ventured into this``sticky'' research area, which has kept me attracted since 1967. Faillard's attention was focused mainly on the synthetic aspects of Sia science and his results are summarized in Refs. [3,6\u00b18] . In the following I will summarize the results of my research groups, \u00aerst at the university in Bochum, and since 1976 in Kiel, on sialic acids, and will discuss the future mainstreams and challenges of this special \u00aeeld in glycosciences.",

            "text": "When I entered the sialic acid \u00aeeld, the main area of interest was still in the chemistry of this exciting monosaccharide, but also in its distribution in nature and metabolism. The main pathway of the biosynthesis, transfer and degradation of Sia were already known, mainly by the work of Saul Roseman and coworkers (summarized in Refs. [1,6\u00b19] ). I started with the isolation and structural analysis of the various Sia found in different animal species, as well as with the study of their behaviour towards the action of sialidases and sialatepyruvate-lyases. The availability of an anion-exchange technique in combination with adsorption chromatography on cellulose powder with butanolapropanolawater (1:2:1) of Sia liberated from their glycosidic linkage by sialidase or mild hydrochloric acid enabled the isolation and puri\u00aecation of larger quantities of individual Sia [10] . This was a prerequisite for the structural analysis of, for example, the number and position of O-acetyl groups, which was tentatively possible by quantitative periodate oxidation followed by a dropping mercury electrode [10] , as well as by several colorimetric and thin-layer chromatographic methods, summarized in [11] . However, exact Sia analysis, especially of minute amounts, became only possible after the development of a combination of gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (GCaMS) [12] . This was the beginning of a long and fruitful collaboration with the group of J.F.G. Vliegenthart and J.P. Kamerling at Utrecht University and led to the discovery of many new neuraminic acid derivatives in a variety of natural sources. Thus, the number of Sia species increased to over fourty, including 2-keto-3-deoxy-nonulosonic acid (Kdn) and its derivatives [8] . These comprise those with N-acetyl-or N-glycolyl groups, combined with O-acetyl residues or the less frequent O-lactyl, O-methyl or O-sulfate groups ( Figure 1 ). Furthermore, Sia were discovered with a double bond between C-2 and C-3 (5-N-acetyl-2-deoxy-2,3-didehydro-neuraminic acid, Neu2en5Ac) found in the free form in animal\u00afuids, \u00aerst in human urine [13] , or with an internal anhydro linkage (5-N-acetyl-2,7-anhydroneuraminic acid, Neu2,7an5Ac) in animals and in, for example, human cerumen (summarized in [8] ). For the identi\u00aecation of trace amounts of all these Sia in biological materials the technique described in Ref. [12] , based on pertrimethylsilylether-, methyl-or trimethylsilylester derivatives, is still of great value due to its speci\u00aecity and sensitivity. Previous puri\u00aecation of Sia, by ion-exchange chromatography for instance, in order to get a better resolution of sialic acid mixtures, is recommended. Another GCaMS method has been described by Zanetta [14] using hepta\u00afuorobutyric anhydride derivatives, which also allows the identi\u00aecation of different Sia in mixtures, even from impure samples, in minute quantities.",

            "text": "With these tools available, it is possible, and necessary, to study in the future the wider occurrence of different Sia in biological materials. So far, Sia analyses have been carried out only sporadically, these have, however, revealed that these monosaccharides do not occur randomly. They are expressed both quantitatively and qualitatively depending on the microorganism or animal species, as well as on the kind of tissue or cell and on the function or developmental stage. Large differences in diseased cells were observed, which will be discussed later. Thus, in the last 20 years, Sia have more often been found in microorganisms, for example in lipopolysaccharides [8, 17] \u00aerst observed in the core region of the LPS of purple bacteria of the genus Rhodobacter [18] , or in trypanosomes like in Trypanosoma cruzi [19] . Unexpectedly, Sia were also identi\u00aeed in developing insects, in Drosophila melanogaster [20] and in the cicada Philaenus spumarius [21] , in both cases in the form of polysialic acid, of the nerve ganglia and Malpighian tubules, respectively. Neuraminic acid derivatives were also described in Galleria mellonella [22] . The presence of Sia has also been reported in cultured insect cells [23] . To my knowledge, there are no further reports on the occurrence of Sia in other lower animals. Only from the echinoderms onwards, Sia seem to exist regularly, although, of course, not yet all species have been investigated [8] . Sporadic, earlier reports of this monosaccharide in plants could not be con\u00aermed by modern analysis. We have studied several plant sources, including the mucin from Drosera binata, but did not \u00aend Sia, although we obtained for the \u00aerst time structural data from this biologically important acid polysaccharide [24] . The systematic analysis of Sia in the animal kingdom or under different physiological or pathological states will show the real distribution of Sia in the living systems and will help to better understand the roles of the various Sia species and to get more insight into their regulation Figure 1 . The family of naturally occurring sialic acids. The nomenclature including abbreviations is described in Ref. [8] .

While the biosynthetic route of the maternal Sia Neu5Ac is well known, as reviewed in [6\u00b19], the enzymatic reactions modifying this monosaccharide are at present still being intensively studied. Ever since the discovery, in porcine submandibular gland mucin, of large quantities of Neu5Gc, and high amounts of O-acetylated Sia in bovine submandibular glands [5\u00b19], we have taken an interest in the metabolism of these Sia. The oxidative conversion of the N-acetyl group of Neu5Ac to the N-glycolyl residue of Neu5Gc had already been observed in 1968 in surviving slices of pig submandibular glands [31] . However, it took until 1988 to determine the substrate for this reaction, that being CMP-Neu5Ac [32] . This \u00aending led to a rapid sequence of publications from various laboratories, mainly of Akemi Suzuki in Tokyo, Ajit Varki in San Diego and our group, summarized in [29] . The enzyme requires oxygen and NADH, which obtains electrons via the ubiquitous electron transport system composed of cytochrome b 5 reductase and cytochrome b 5 . In mammals, this hydroxylase is soluble, in contrast to star\u00aesh, where it is membrane-bound [33] . However, using hydroxylase antibodies and electron microscopy, in pig lymphocytes the enzyme was found to be attached to the surface of the nucleus and to some neighbouring microsomes [30] . From the cytosol, the CMP-Neu5Gc produced is transported into the Golgi lumen together with the corresponding Neu5Ac glycoside [34] .",

However, in healthy human tissues only traces (0.1% and less) of this Sia exist, although this amount in some tumours has been reported to increase up to a few percent [29] . However, enzyme activity has never been reported in normal or malignant tissues. The reason for this de\u00aeciency in man is the lack of a 92 bp region of the cDNA coding for the human CMP-Neu5Ac hydroxylase [35, 36] . The resulting mRNA codes for a truncated protein lacking a considerable position of the N-terminus, including the binding for the Rieske iron-sulphur centre [37] , which is probably essential for catalytic activity. Other biosynthetic routes or dietary sources must therefore be considered to be responsible for the minute amounts of human Neu5Gc. Some experimental basis for the latter possibility was provided by No \u00c8hle et al. [38, 39] . When feeding mice and rats with free sialic acids, sialyllactose and porcine submandibular gland mucin radioactively labelled in the Sia moiety, it was found that free Sia were rapidly adsorbed from the intestine and excreted by the urine. This process was, however, much slower from the glycosidically bound Sia, with a small proportion, including Neu5Gc, of this radioactivity later being found in liver glycoproteins. This shows that Neu5Gc from a dietary source can be reused, at least in these animals. However, evidence that this may also happen in human tissues is being provided by immunological experiments. These show that Neu5Gc-reactivity occurs in endothelial cells of blood vessels from fetal tissues and carcinoma rather than in stromal cells [40] .",

This occurs either at the pyranose ring or at the different hydroxyls of the side-chain ([6\u00b19,41] for review). At least two enzymes catalyse these esteri\u00aecations, either an acetyl coenzyme A:sialate-4-O-acetyltransferase or a corresponding 7(9)-O-acetyltransferase. First insight into the biosynthesis of these Sia was obtained in 1970 [42] by the incubation of radioactively labelled acetate into surviving slices of bovine and equine submandibular glands. It took a long time until the enzyme reactions could be demonstrated in in vitro systems. These enzymes are localized in the subcellular membrane fractions of guinea pig liver [43] and equine submandibular gland (Tiralongo et al., unpublished) in the case of 4-O-acetylation, as well as in rat liver [44] and bovine submandibular gland [45] in the case of 9-Oacetylation. Solubilization of an active enzyme from these membranes by detergent has proved to be dif\u00aecult, but enrichment from guinea pig liver and bovine submandibular gland was possible (unpublished). There is evidence that the primary site of the bovine O-acetyltransferase is at C-7 forming N-acetyl-7-O-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5,7Ac 2 ), from where the O-acetyl group migrates to C-9, probably accelerated by an enzyme, a``migrase'' [45] . A non-enzymatic but slow isomerization of Neu5,7Ac 2 to Neu5,9Ac 2 was earlier shown to occur under physiological conditions by NMR spectroscopy [46] . No primary structure or gene encoding the sialate O-acetyltransferase is yet available. Several approaches utilising expression cloning led to an increased production of O-acetylated Sia, but failed to obtain the gene coding for the enzyme [41, 47] . We are trying to reach this goal via enzyme puri\u00aecation in order to obtain peptide sequences of the O-acetyltransferases, however, this approach has also proved to be rather tedious.",

This motif is found four to \u00aeve times in all microbial sequences studied with the exception of viral sialidases, where it is found only once or twice or is even absent [57] . It also occurs in the sialidases from eukaryotic origin, that is, from mammals, including man, and from trypanosomes (summarized in [55] ). Likewise, trypanosomal trans-sialidases (see below) have this motif. In contrast to the Asp boxes, which are found throughout the sequence, another motif, FRIP, is located in the N-terminal part. It encompasses the amino acids \u00b1X-R-X-P with the arginine and proline residues absolutely conserved.

This enzyme preferably transfers the sialic acid molecule from one glycosidic linkage onto another sugar (galactose) molecule instead of water and forms exclusively a2,3 linkages (for reviews see [8, 55] ). A sugar nucleotide donor, as for the classical sialyltransferases, is not involved. First hints for the possible existence of such an enzyme were obtained during a cooperation with Miercio Pereira, when we identi\u00aeed sialic acids (Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc) in the American trypanosomal species Trypanosoma cruzi and found that they were not synthesized by the parasites themselves but were derived from the incubation medium. The Sia had not just been adsorbed to the cells but seemed to be covalently incorporated into the cell surface molecules. Since these trypanosomes also expressed a sialidase, we speculated that this enzyme may be responsible for the acquisition of the sialic acids [19] . It is known, and utilised for synthetic purposes, that the sialidase reaction under certain conditions is slightly reversible. In 1992 Schenkman's group discovered the trans-sialidase reaction in T. cruzi [62] , after Previato et al. [63] had obtained more evidence for a new route of Sia acquisition. One year later Markus Engstler described this enzyme in the African species T. brucei [64] . Strikingly, the catalytic properties of these enzymes were rather similar, pointing to conserved structures and important functions. This is astonishing because the African and American continents began to drift apart many million years ago.",

On the African and American continents many millions of people and cattle are suffering from trypanosomiasis (Chagas and sleeping diseases).

In contrast to many other sialidases, trans-sialidases have not yet been crystallized. The relationship of these enzymes to animal sialidases gives raise to the assumption that they may have been derived from genes of higher eucaryotes or even acquired from that source.

Most strikingly, Neu4,5Ac 2 is, as is the case with sialidases, resistant to the action of lyases. The enzymes are rather thermostable and are optimally active between 65 and 80 C. They belong to the class I aldolases, that is, a Schiff's base is formed between the keto group of Neu5Ac at C-2 and a lysine residue of the enzyme protein, prior to the aldol cleavage reaction of Sia between C-3 and C-4. Correspondingly, absolutely conserved lysine and tyrosine residues, the latter probably being involved in stabilization of the Sia side-chain, have been found in the primary structures of a growing lyase family by gene cloning. These amino acids are localized in the catalytic centre of Escherichia coli lyase, as shown by X-ray analysis of the crystallized enzyme [76] . Based on the unpublished observation (Traving et al.) that the primary structures of the kidney and the microbial lyase are similar, the question is once again raised, like with sialidases, about the evolutionary origin of these enzymes. More knowledge about these phenomena as well as the catalytic mechanism, the regulatory function and, for example, the exact location in the cytosol of mammalian cells by immuno-histochemical methods of these Sia-speci\u00aec lyases should be obtained by future work. This also includes the use of lyases for the enzymatic synthesis [8] of natural and modi\u00aeed Sia for biological and pharmacological studies.",

This pointed to a missing link in Sia metabolism, namely sialic acid-speci\u00aec esterases.

The tertiary structure of this complex was recently published [80] . Such an esterase has also been found in corona viruses. Human nasal and bronchial mucin contain a low percentage of Neu5,9Ac 2 , which may enable attachment of the viruses and infection of the underlining epithelium. In\u00afuenza C virus is a speci\u00aec and very sensitive detector of Neu5,9Ac 2 in tissue sections and isolated glycoproteins or gangliosides on thin-layers or in gels. This can be applied to tumour diagnosis, in for example melanoma [81] and basalioma [81a] .",

These examples show that different Sia are involved in distinct in\u00afammatory processes and that elucidation of the mechanisms will provide rewarding future projects, also giving chemists the opportunity to synthesize inhibitors of the adhesion or esterase activity as therapeutical tools. A hypothetical hydrolase which seems to be widely distributed and awaits investigation, as mentioned above, is the de-N-acetylase of bound Sia [8, 9] . This enzyme is believed to be involved in cell regulation and, for instance, in the synthesis of cyclic sialyl 6-sulfo Le x on human leucocytes, which is biologically inactive but can be reactived by hydrolysis of the intramolecular amide bond [83] .",

A similar function was observed between liver and spleen macrophages and erythrocytes, \u00aerst observed with human red blood cells [87] , which have lost 10\u00b120% of their surface Sia (1\u00b1 2 \u00c2 10 7 moleculesacell) either by ageing or under the in\u00afuence of sialidase from blood serum or microorganisms. The red cells bind to the phagocytes via their demasked galactose residues to a galactose-speci\u00aec receptor and ultimately are taken up and degraded [88] . This mechanism can work without the involvement of immunoglobulin or complement and represents the main sequestration process of aged cells [89] . Sialidase-treated lymphocytes also attach to macrophages by this mechanism (Figure 5 ), however, are not engulfed but are released after about one day incubation due to resialylation of the cell surface [90] . Also malignant cells can be eliminated in this way, and it is understandable that oversialylation, often observed in such cells, protects them from humoral and cellular defense systems and thus increases their malignancy. Sialylation of microorganisms follows the same strategy, allowing better survival in the host organisms. This can be achieved in different ways, like total synthesis of sialic acids and possibly polysialic acids (colominic acid in E. coli strains, [8] ), the acquisition of Sia from the host with the aid of trans-sialidases in some trypanosomal strains (as described above), or the transfer of Sia from CMP-glycoside of the host by a sialyltransferase expressed by the pathogenic bacterium (for example gonococci, studied in detail by the group of Smith, [17] ).",

This receptor belongs to the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF), of which, until now, at least ten members have been discovered in several laboratories, including CD22 on B-cells, and MAG, the myelin-associated glycoprotein on oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells as the earliest and best characterized species [28] .

Cytokines play here an essential role. Selectins preferably recognize sialylated Lewis structures (SiaLe x ). Since these can also occur on tumour cells, selectins can be involved in the formation of metastases.",

The masking function is increased and prolonged, by modi\u00aecations retarding the release by sialidases of the corresponding Sia, Neu5Gc and O-acetylated derivatives, from glycoconjugates and thus extending the life-time of molecules and cells. Dramatic changes may occur in the counter-receptor function of Sia, either by abolishing or modifying it. As an example, hydroxylation of Neu5Ac leads to better binding to the murine and human CD22, but sialoadhesin and MAG do not tolerate an N-glycolyl residue [95] . Also other Siglecs including those from man and Great Apes bind to Neu5Ac and Neu5Gc with different af\u00aenities, from which it may be concluded that loss of Neu5Gc in humans in\u00afuenced the evolutionary process [96] . The attachment of some virus species, however, was found to be improved by hydroxylation [29] .",

In contrast, 9-O-acetylation prevents the attachment of in\u00afuenza A and B viruses, as well as of malaria parasites [41] . Also the interaction with Siglecs (CD22, MAG, Sn) is much hampered by this modi\u00aecation [28, 97] , as well as the binding of sLe x to selectins [98] . In the latter case, loss of O-acetylation of sLe x in human colon cancer facilitates metastasis by the mechanism outlined previously in this review. It is also thought that in this area we are beginning to understand the role of Sia in the communication between cells and its physiological and pathological consequences. More knowledge will accumulate also in the interaction of host Sia with viruses and other microorganisms, which have``misused'' these monosaccharides for infection (see above). Attention was recently focused on Helicobacter pylori, often the cause of gastric diseases, of which several strains bind to the epithelia via Sia [99] . The receptor\u00b1ligand interaction involved in colonization can be inhibited with soluble ligands, sialylated oligosaccharides and glycoproteins, such as from milk, which gives these substances a great``glycopharmacological'' potential. This will gain signi\u00aecance as alternative therapies to treatment with antibiotics.",

The main roles seem to be structural and protecting effects, especially on cell membranes, and to regulate molecular interactions and thus the cross-talk between cells and infectious agents. Since these are crucial events in cell biology, the regulation of the``right'' amount of Sia is necessary. This is also true for the molecules to which Sia are bound. Thus, imbalances can emerge not only from alterations in the biosynthesis and transfer of the different Sia, but also of the supporting molecules. This may be due to changes in gene expression or to the in\u00afuence of hormones or toxins and can result in genetically inherent or acquired``glycoprotein de\u00aeciency syndromes''. If hereditary, these diseases are now named``Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation'' (CDG) [105] . Not much is known on hormonal effects, but insulin for example in\u00afuences the sialylation of cells [106] . Alcohol is an example of a toxin that decreases sialylation, also of gangliosides, and explains the neurological effects of alcohol abuse [107, 108] . Sialic acids will have a great future in medical sciences and one of the most recent examples are encephalopathies caused by prions, the glycosylation residues of which are sialylated [108a] These observations require further studies on the regulation of the biosynthesis of sialylated glycoconjugates and on the rate-limiting metabolic events. Fascinating insight has recently been obtained into the molecular genetics and properties of the key enzyme of Sia metabolism, the UDP-GlcNAc epimerase [109] , as one step in this direction. The dietary aspect of glycobiology is becoming more and more recognized, not only with regard to the in\u00afuence on bacterial and viral colonization in mucous epithelia but also with regard to supply of the organism with special carbohydrates, including Sia [110, 111] .",
