Basically, cloud computing comprises three models:Cloud IaaS: This provides clients with access to storage space, bandwidth, and other fundamental computing services. It effectively expands the computing capability of the customer, allowing them to run their own software and applications using the cloud infrastructure;Cloud PaaS: This allows the customer to gain access to the computer platform or operating systems of the cloud instances (e.g. Windows and Linux) and an underlying database so that they can create or acquire applications;Cloud SaaS: This allows clients of the CSP to utilize software and applications running on the cloud infrastructure. The applications are accessed via remote computers and mobile devices using the appropriate cloud interface software. The consumer\u2019s device acts like a portal to the software and data stored in the cloud.\n",

A variety of terms are used when explaining the criminality associated with the popularity and commercialization of information communication technology (ICT), including \u201cnew technology crime,\u201d \u201conline crime,\u201d \u201ccybercrime,\u201d and \u201cInternet crime.\u201d These terms tend to be used interchangeably, which makes it difficult to provide universal definitions. ICT is constantly evolving along with the associated criminality, including cloud computing crime. In addition, certain types of online activities considered to be \u201cInternet\u201d or \u201ccloud computing\u201d crime in some countries are not considered as such in others. For example, in most Western common law countries, if a female posts topless beach holiday \u201cselfies\u201d on Facebook via a smart mobile phone to share among friends, the act would be considered a harmless private activity. In many Muslim countries, and certainly those in the Middle East, however, the act would be considered a criminal offense; the woman would be subject to criminal prosecution in court and the act would be punishable by public lashing. Both polity and invested interests are at play, and the novelty of the \u201crisk\u201d or \u201cthreat\u201d posed by new forms of technology-associated crimes can be used to support a larger share of government funding.",

The popularity of smaller mobile computing devices such as smart phones, which have resulted from advancements in Internet technologies, has been combined with the nature of cloud computing, which provides faster, easier access to files in remote locations, to allow users to access and update files on the move. Although cloud computing technologies offer efficiency in terms of users\u2019 hardware requirements and access barriers, they also create challenges for both law enforcement authorities and individuals alike. One such issue is the policing of computer-related crime, which involves gathering evidence from, storing data in, the cloud, and then prosecuting the perpetrator. Scholars have drawn attention to some of these issues, but the socio-legal perspective treated here has not received much attention in the literature to date. Policing priority is typically set by country or place individually according to their needs. Factors affecting policing include the economy, legal traditions, police structure and organization, cultural factors, and political structure. The protection of these factors and their perceived importance is different in each jurisdiction and under each government in power, and thus policing varies accordingly.",

For instance, in accordance with the United Nation International Telecommunication Union (UNITU) report on the digital divide in 2012,1\nIT disparities in terms of access to information and communication technology are pronounced between the developed Western economies such as those of America, Canada, and Western European countries (this group includes a few advanced economies in Asia such as those of Japan, South Korea, Singapore, and Hong Kong), and the less-developed economies such as those of Northern Africa, Latin America, Pacific Ocean Islands, and some parts of South Eastern Asia. The level of policing for the Internetwork is also different, as each country prompts different government perceptions of its level of technology risk or economic threat. These perceptions are largely dependent on the level of technology each country relies on to generate wealth, and sometimes on how much a given government sees technology as a threat to its political structure and systems. Thus, technology policing is prioritized differently from country to country.",

Despite the downward trend, prices remain relatively high in many low-income countries. For mobile broadband to replicate the mobile-cellular miracle and bring more people from developing countries online, 3G network coverage has to be extended and prices have to go down even further. \u2026 Mobile-cellular subscriptions registered continuous double-digit growth in developing country markets, for a global total of six billion mobile subscriptions by end 2011 \u2026 noting that China and India each account for around one billion subscriptions. Mobile broadband continues to be the ICT service displaying the sharpest growth rates. Over the past year, growth in mobile-broadband services continued at 40 per cent globally and 78 per cent in developing countries.

The technique of virtualization in cloud computing has created an economy of scale, such that services are only provided when there is consumer demand. This allows service providers to reduce their materials and service costs. On one hand, almost all smart phone devices now allow users to constantly connect with the Internetwork on the go; anytime, anywhere. On the other hand, to enhance the user\u2019s smart mobile phone experience, service providers must design their services based on users\u2019 needs. This can result in compromised safe-guards and security, which in turn create opportunities for criminal activity, and authorities have yet to catch up to these technologies, especially when perpetrators can be located overseas or in different police jurisdictions.",

For example, according to a 2011 KPMG International report on cybercrime, cybercriminals are moving beyond desktop computers to target smart mobile phones and other mobile devices. The report stated that in the previous 2 years, digital crimes specifically targeting mobile devices had risen 46%.5\nAlthough the actual level of smart mobile phone crime is not known, and what is known is probably just the tip of the iceberg, the potential for problems is sobering.

In a joint operation between Customs and Excise and the police in April 2014 in the Tsim Sha Tsui area, 7 people were arrested and 1156 items of suspected counterfeit goods valued at HK$270,0007\nwere seized. In July 2014, a similar operation was mounted by the Hong Kong authorities and 42 people (7 of whom were younger than 22) were arrested and goods valued at about HK$340,000 were seized.8\nAccording to Hong Kong authorities, in the first 6 months of 2014 the number of people arrested who are younger than 22 has risen by 67% compared to the same period in 2013. In these cases, most of the young offenders participated in the sale of suspected counterfeit goods on Internet platforms via mobile phones, through auction sites or social networks, during their leisure time. Other types of crime have been committed using smart mobile phones. In January 2014, according to Paul Gordon, Sai Kung divisional commander, thieves used surveillance cameras to monitor their targets instead of doing their own reconnaissance:A device will be fixed outside a house and linked to their [smart]-mobile phones, to monitor when it is left unattended. Then they will take the chance to break in. The device was low-tech and could be bought cheaply in the Sham Shui Po electronics market. But it was the first time police had seen it used in this kind of crime.9\n",

The incidence of related petty crimes such as smart phone snatching has also risen. In another example from Singapore, Channel News Asia11\ninterviewed an Inspector of the Singapore Police. During the live interview, conducted on April 23, 2014, the Inspector described a smart mobile phone crime case involving a woman in her late 40s who was an accountant by profession. She allegedly befriended a male who claimed to be a pilot for Singapore Airline. They met and chatted on Whatsapp12\nthrough their smart phones for some time, and ultimately agreed to meet face-to-face in a caf\u00e9 near the Singapore International Airport. The supposed pilot told the woman that he had been in a hurry to get out of his flat and had forgotten to bring enough Euros with him. He asked the woman if she would transfer 2000 Singapore dollars to a certain bank account under his name, so that when he landed in Germany the next day he could withdraw the cash from an ATM. He promised to repay her in a week\u2019s time, when he returned. The woman agreed and transferred the money via her smart phone. For some time, she did not hear from the man and could not contact him on Whatsapp. After 4 months she reported him to the police.

The term was only coined in the late 2000s. Victims of cloud computing crime might not even realize their status as such, or they may choose not to report it, as the police are sometimes unable to recognize it as such and instead record it as traditional street crime. Even when the police recognize and record an event as cloud computing crime, they may have difficulty following up, especially if the servers and data involved are located overseas or in multiple jurisdictions. As Quick et al. explain, \u201cthe key component of cloud computing is multi-tenancy capability, which is referred to as a shared pool of resources \u2026 individual files may be distributed across multiple disks and storage systems across multiple jurisdictions.\u201d13\nSecuring and preserving a chain of evidence for prosecution in court involves significant police resources, and even if the culprit is deported to face justice, the case may not pass the prosecution\u2019s test of public interest and the perpetrator could escape justice.",

Almost all of the manufacturing factories were moved northward across the border to Shenzhen City or beyond in mainland China, due to cheaper wages and land. By this time, Hong Kong was beginning to establish itself as a financial center and professional services hub, largely serving the booming mainland China economy supported by the open-door policy and the growth of the Asian economy.

Small business is especially vulnerable to this, as Australian Institute of Criminology research29\nin 2013 (Hutchings et al., 2013) shows that small business is vulnerable to side channel attack or cross-guest virtual machine breaches, because in cloud, resources are shared with different tenants at the same cloud data center. As a result, tenants might crossing the shared virtual machine segment and accessing the data of other tenants using shared physical resources. More importantly, the same research has identified that small business is more vulnerable because they operate in highly financially constrained environment when compared with larger \u201cglobal multinational\u201d business, yet they are induced by the promise of cloud computing to save on their ICT overhead. As Hutchings et al. said \u201cHowever, in adopting cloud computing, it is this distinct operating environment that also renders small businesses vulnerable to criminal and security threats [once attack happened some small businesses might not able to recover from it and the business could possibly come to abruptly end].\u201d30\nNevertheless, nearly 90% of the businesses in Hong Kong and in Singapore are regarded as small businesses employing less than 20 people. Interestingly, users also wonder whether the data are protected from the cloud provider. Cloud computing is largely modeled on the demand for access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources such as networks, servers, storage, applications, and services. All such resource sharing is to ensure fast provision and saving on costs. For example, US researchers were able to hack into Gmail accounts with a 92% success rate by exploiting a weakness in smart mobile phone memory. The same research also found that once a smart mobile phone memory has been exploited, there is a great risk of collateral damage to other mobile apps on the same smart phone. As Zhiyun Qian said:The assumption has always been that these apps can\u2019t interfere with [each] other easily, but such assumption was wrong, one app can in fact significantly impact another and result in harmful consequences for the user.31\n",
