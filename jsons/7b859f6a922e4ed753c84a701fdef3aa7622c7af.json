This phenomenon has yet to be directly explored in episodic memory, nor explored for reaction times or physiological correlates. We designed a novel method to elicit the DKE via a test of item recognition while electroencephalography (EEG) was recorded. Throughout the task, participants were asked to estimate the percentile in which they performed compared to others. Results Between-group EEG differences were evident between over-estimators and underestimators during Dunning-Kruger responses, which revealed FN400-like effects of familiarity supporting differences for over-estimators from 400-600 ms, whereas 'oldnew' memory ERP effects revealed a late parietal component (LPC) associated with recollection-based processing from 600-900 ms for under-estimators that was not evident for over-estimators. Findings suggest over-and under-estimators use differing cognitive processes when assessing their performance, such that under-estimators rely on recollection during memory and over-estimators draw upon excess familiarity when over-estimating their performance. Episodic memory thus appears to play a contributory role in metacognitive judgments of illusory superiority and inferiority.",

For example, the overconfidence that the Titanic was unsinkable led to loss of over 1500 lives (Bartlett, 2012; Lord, 1986; Lord, 1955) and in modern times, the COVID-19 pandemic of 2020 has been noted for widespread over-estimation of abilities to manage the pandemic concurrent with early underestimation of its world-wide impact by many world health organizations, governments, and media alike (with a few exceptions). Conversely, when the most competent people hold contributions from teams or society because they think others are better suited, the effects can also lead to serious problems that can be a substantial loss on society. For example, we could lose the most competent people for leadership positions, and instead embrace those whose merely think they are the best (incorrectly). Therefore, it is important to understand how and why these inaccurate judgments of one's abilities occur, so that they can be prevented.",

In their landmark study, Dunning and Kruger conducted several studies showing that bottom performers on a tests of humor judgments, logical reasoning, and grammar overestimated their performance percentile and that, conversely, top performers underestimated their performance percentile. The name \"The Dunning-Kruger Effect\" became highly popularized throughout mainstream culture and society (Herrera, 2018; Marczyk, 2017) . Generically, the DKE describes a phenomenon in which self-estimates of performance on a task and the related percentile ranking among others also participating in the task do not match actual performance. The direction of this mis-match of self-perception extends in both directions (Sieber, 1979) . Empirically, this paradigm has been used successfully in many different tasks to elicit the DKE on such tasks as microeconomics college exams (Ryvkin, Kraj\u010d, & Ortmann, 2012b) , knowledge about the University of Chicago (Burson et al., 2006) , logical reasoning (Schl\u00f6sser et al., 2013) , cognitive reflection (Pennycook et al., 2017) , size judgments (Sanchez, 2016) , finance (Atir, Rosenzweig, & Dunning, 2015) , and computer programming (Critcher & Dunning, 2009 ). More broadly, the effect has been referred to in popular culture contexts of aviation, (Woodbury, 2018) , driving (Svenson, 1981) , and professors rating their own teaching skills (Cross, 1977) .",

The DKE is a psychological phenomenon in which a mismatch in one's perceived ability and the reality of one's objective performance on a given task appears to be directionally moderated by the factor of ability. Low performers (individuals who do not earn high scores on a test using an objective scale) tend to overestimate their performance percentile on a task while high performers (individuals who earn high scores measured on an objective scale) tend to underestimate their performance percentile on the same task. Most paradigms used to research the DKE follow a similar format: participants are given a task such as a series of logical reasoning problems or math problems, etc., and after they finish the task in its entirety, they are asked to estimate their overall percentile estimate and objective score on the task. That is, their metacognitive judgment is measured as a single data point assessed at the conclusion of the study and represents their aggregated assessment of performance across many trials. That approach has not, however, permitted the ability to measure multiple instances of the cognitive phenomenon per person, and has precluded being able to collect simple statistical measures of central tendency, such as reaction times. Accordingly, extant approaches have also precluded the collection of neuroscientific measures that rely upon have multiple measures per person (electroencephalography (EEG), fMRI, etc.), but which may illuminate contributory cognitive processes.",

Five years later, Oskamp (1965) found that when clinical psychologists were asked to make a diagnosis for a case study, their confidence in their decision increased when they were given more information about the case although their accuracy did not increase. These instances showed that confidence and accuracy were not necessarily correlated, both in experimental studies and in more practical issues of clinical diagnoses. This finding has persisted in modern research on memory as well (Hirst et al., 2015; Kvavilashvili, et al., 2009 ) and will be discussed later below.",

            "text": "Memory research intersects with the DKE at the point of confidence in one's memories and the accuracy of those memories. A large collection of research is available that supports the finding that high confidence does not beget high accuracy (Chua, et al, 2012; Roediger & DeSoto, 2014; Koriat et al., 2008; Nelson & Narens, 1990; Wells, et al., 2002) . People can often exhibit illusory over-confidence in their memory judgments, and this has had wide-ranging impacts on society. For example, socalled 'flashbulb memories' and thought to be some of our most salient memories, yet are found to be no more accurate than other memories despite the participants' high confidence in their accuracy (Neisser & Harsch, 1992; Brown & Kulik, 1977) . Other experiments studying the 'false fame' phenomenon demonstrate that familiarity with names can lead to falsely recognizing them as famous later (Dywan & Jacoby, 1990; Jacoby, Woloshyn, & Kelley, 1989 , 2004 : familiarity caused participants to falsely believe an ordinary name was famous because they could not recollect the context in which the name was presented. Perhaps some of the most impactful research on memory failing to correlate with accuracy pertains to the criminal justice system (Heaton-Armstrong, et al., 2006; Loftus, 1975; Loftus & Zanni, 1975; Nadel & Sinnott-Armstrong, 2012; Pena, et al., 2017; Schacter & Loftus, 2013) . In a study by Pena et al. (2017) researchers asked participants to make judgments about their accuracy on a memory test for a mock crime observed earlier in a study. They found that participants who performed poorly on the memory test for details of a mock crime overestimated their memory accuracy, similar to what has been found for making prospective judgments of learning (JOL) (Irak, et al., 2019; M\u00fcller et al., 2016; Metcalfe & Finn, 2008; Koriat & Ma'ayan, 2005) . These results were consistent with the results of poor performers exhibiting the DKE, demonstrating the link that may inherently exist between the two domains of memory and metacognition, yet which remains largely unexplored.",

In this research, there was a common finding of people having overconfidence in wrong answers (Fischhoff, Slovic, & Lichtenstein, 1977; Harvey, 1990; Howell, 1971; May, 1986 ) and a less common finding of under-confident correct answers for top performers (Sieber, 1979) since the focus of the research at that time was not the high performers. The term \"overconfidence effect\" developed to describe this pattern of higher self-estimates of confidence than ability, which stemmed into a related social psychological phenomena known as the 'better-than-average-effect' (BTAE), whereby people are found to rate themselves as better than average peers (for Review see Zell et al., 2019; Alicke & Govorun, 2005; Chambers & Windschitl, 2004; Moore & Healy, 2008; Sedikides, Gaertner, & Cai, 2015; Brown, 1986 Brown, , 2010 Hartwig & Dunlosky, 2014) .

More simply, poor performers do not have the knowledge to complete the task correctly and because they do not know their answers are incorrect, they believe they are performing well (i.e. 'ignorance is bliss') (Schl\u00f6sser et al., 2013) .

The term 'reach-around knowledge' refers to a person's unique knowledge gained from previously participating in a similar task to the task presented and generalizing their past experiences to the current experience (Dunning, 2011) . Kruger and Dunning postulated that participants use 'reach-around-knowledge' to help achieve their estimation, though this doesn't necessarily require that it leads them to an accurate perception. According to this view, in order to give an overestimation, one must first have knowledge about the same or similar tasks but not have the knowledge about the details of the task to complete it correctly. Having a larger store of reach-around knowledge should therefore increase the overestimation of poor performer's scores. On the contrary, having a smaller store of reach-around knowledge should decrease the overestimation of one's abilities resulting in a more accurate performance estimate.",

Nevertheless, it provides a useful platform from which to expand upon in investigating this phenomenon within a theoretical construct. The 'reach-around-knowledge' account provided by Dunning and Kruger refers to changes in current behavior based upon prior experience, which is fundamentally a defining feature of memory (Rudy, 2013) , and as such it recognizes a key role that memory processes may play in contributing to this metacognitive illusion. There happens to be a rich and robust empirical history of memory processes being both theoretically and operationally defined and studied. Two of these cognitive processes of episodic memory that may contribute to the DKE are familiarity and recollection (Yonelinas, 1999; Eichenbaum et al., 2008; Yonelinas et al., 2010) . These processes align closely with the general concepts that Dunning and",

Broadly, familiarity refers to having exposure to some material but not being able to recall the context in which it was presented, usually associated with mid-levels of confidence, whereas recollection refers instead to information that one can recall specific contextual details about and is typically associated only with high-confidence memories (Addante, et al., 2012a (Addante, et al., , 2012b . In explicit memory, theoretical models of recognition are largely governed by the dual processes of familiarity and recollection (Diana, Yonelinas, & Ranganath, 2008; Eichenbaum et al., 2007; Ranganath, 2010; Yonelinas, 2002; Yonelinas, Aly, Wang, & Koen, 2010) (though see Wixted, 2007 and Wixted & Mickes, 2010 for alternative views), and it is possible that understanding of familiarity and recollection processes in memory may help explain a proportion of variance in the DKE.",

On the other hand, recollection has been associated with differences between memory conditions occurring at a peak in the ERP at the parietal region of the scalp from approximately 600 milliseconds to 900 milliseconds called the late parietal component, or LPC Leynes et al., 2005 ; for reviews see Rugg & Curran, 2007; Friedman, 2013) .

Based upon the converging literatures from memory and metacognition, a viable alternative theory we postulate to explain the DKE is that illusory superiority may also be driven, at least in part, by increased familiarity from prior experience of one's past with the tested materials (e.g.: Chua et al., 2012) . People may use a decision heuristic inducing a sense of performing well despite a lack of specific retrieval of the relevant details that would be involved in marking competency with the material. In this view, the experience of lacking a distinct recollection for but being generally familiar with material will lead people to assume that they are competent and successful at the task. This scenario would be associated with increased FN400 amplitudes in ERPs for inaccurate overestimators.",

When plotted against actual performance, results from subjects' reported performance estimates revealed that the canonical DKE was evident, thereby replicating the DKE and extending it to our novel episodic memory paradigm ( Figure 2 ). To quantify and analyze this effect, the participants were first split into quartiles based on memory accuracy (the procedure for grouping of subjects into groups based upon estimated performance vs actual performance was described in detail earlier in the Methods). The average memory test accuracy, organized by quartile and each quartile's respective average post-test Dunning-Kruger response, is listed in Table 3 . Parameter estimates of decision processes during memory retrieval. Another possible account of the DKE results is that subjects may have differentially engaged with the task, or that results may reflect different decision-making strategies (we thank two anonymous Reviewers for raising these possibilities). To assess this possibility, we conducted analyses to quantify if subjects were using any discernably different decision processes reflecting differential engagement in the memory task, using the ROC Toolbox to calculate parameter estimates of their Decision Criterion (C), Response Bias (B), Recollection (Ro), and Familiarity (F) process contributions to performing the memory task (Yonelinas, 2002; 2004; Park & Yonelinas, 2011; Yonelinas et al., 2010; . A one-way ANOVA was performed to identify potential differences among groups (under-estimators, correct-estimators, and over-estimators) on each of the parameters. There were no reliable differences observed among groups (Figure 3 ), corresponding to the underlying performance differences on the memory test between groups. Thus, outside of their core performance on the task, it appears that subjects were meaningfully engaged in the task in similar ways unattributable to factors of strategies, task-engagement, or decision-making differences of the groups.",

Reaction times (RTs) were unable to be measured in previous studies of the DKE because extant studies were limited by including only a single measure of self-estimate of performance at the end of a task, which is not adequate for RT analyses. The current study, however, collected thirty DKE judgements per subject (n = 30), which permitted analysis of response times during these phenomena, in order to gain insight into how the different groups might have performed the task differently. (Table 5) However, because our hypotheses were specifically interested in how people made illusory metacognitive judgments of being either among the best or the worst performers, we also specifically analyzed of the reaction times for when subjects reported performing either the best ('5') or the worst ('1'), as a function of estimatorgroup to explore potential differences in cognitive strategies used to make these illusory self-estimates. For this analysis, the under-estimator group (N = 10) is inherently defined as having a limited number of trials of responding that they believed they were the best percentile, and so this naturally reduced the sample of available subjects with sufficient trials for these sensitive behavioral analyses ( 15. This was an exploratory analysis using small samples that, like all scientific findings, will benefit from corroboration by independent laboratories. However, these results persisted despite the small sample sizes of the groups, and the patterns suggest that future studies using larger groups may find similar patterns. The pattern of responding revealed evidence that people who erred to overestimate their abilities were also responding faster when they believed they were doing the best and slower to say they were the worst, whereas more-accurate underestimators were slower to say they were the best and relatively quicker to say they were the worst.",

One possibility to account for the Dunning-Kruger Effect is that group-level differences could be due to how people encoded the information into memory (Craik & Lockhart, 1972; ; indeed, early accounts of the Dunning-Kruger Effect have posited that results can be due to competency of subjects that can be corrected by improving information acquisition (Kruger & Dunning, 1999) . Similarly, subjects' overconfidence at retrieval could have come from excess fluency at encoding providing feelings that the information was 'easily learned' (we thank an anonymous Reviewer for making this suggestion), leading them to rely upon intuitive perceptions of fluency and feelings of familiarity at retrieval that they incorrectly misattributed as better performance ( RTs of over-estimators and correct-estimators (t(43) = 1.04, p = .303) (Figure 4 ). These findings appear to indicate that under-estimators may have performed better due to having spent (slightly) more time exposed to information tested later.",

First, we assessed the data for general ERP differences that could be identified between the tasks of memory and metacognition judgments. To do this, we assessed the ERPs for decisions in all of the Dunning-Kruger judgments collapsed together compared to the ERPs for all item memory judgements collapsed together, to form a standard baseline for comparison since there had not been prior ERP work done in this kind of metacognitive task ( Figure   5 ). This revealed that ERP activity for the metacognitive DKE decisions was significantly greater than those for memory judgements, starting from approximately 300 ms and continuing through 1000 ms at almost every electrode site. These effects were maximal at the central parietal site of Pz through 800 ms (300-500 ms: t(53) = 10.69, p < .001; 400-600 ms: t(54) = 15.19, p < .001; 600-900 ms: t(53) = 9.79, p < .001) and similarly reliable at several surrounding sites, upon which time the effects became evident as maximal at mid-frontal site Fz from 900-1200 ms (t(53) = 6.46, p < .001) with similar effects at surrounding sites, consistent with prior ERP findings of parietal and anterior P300a/b effects for novelty processing and oddball paradigms (Curran, 2004; Woodruff et al., 2006; Kishiyama et al., 2004; Knight, 1996; Knight & Scabini, 1998) . This basic finding established a foundation that ERPs during the metacognitive judgments of the DKE were reliably distinct from memory-related activity, which we continued further investigation.",

One suggestion from these results is that the frontal effect at 400-600 ms may be characteristic of the FN400 ERP effect related to familiarity-based processing, in that over-estimators may be relying on the less-specific memory process of familiarity or intuitions of increased fluency to guide making their metacognitive judgments, instead of relying upon the more distinct recollection-related processes (Yonelinas et al., 2010 ) that evidently appears to be supporting the people who were under-estimating their performance relative to the group (Figure 7 ). Overall, these findings converge to reveal that the larger LPC magnitudes were related to higher proportions of hits on the memory test and with faster response times for recollection-related items of high confidence hits with correct source memory (Addante et al., 2011; Addante et al., 2012a; Roberts et al., 2018) . Hence, the LPC was related to recollection, and the more recollection signal (LPC) a subject had predicted the more likely they were to under-estimate their memory performance via their average DK responses in the metacognitive judgments (Figure 8 ). Recollection thus apparently led people to exhibit more humble metacognitive self-awareness. What is special about the under-estimators during their decisions to avoid the pitfalls of illusory superiority?",

Therefore, if a person's perception of their self (or prototype of themselves) includes that they perform well on tasks, they will be more likely to give a fast response when rating themselves well as opposed to rating themselves poorly. On the other hand, if they believe they are performing poorly, this perception would oppose the prototype that they have formed, causing them to react slower to rating their performance negatively. The same may be true if under-estimators have formed a perception about themselves that they are only average or even below average: it would then be logical that they would be slower to rate themselves as being best and quicker to believe they are performing poorly.

By this account, over-estimators would be fast to report that they are doing well because they believe they are actually doing well, while they are slow to report that they are performing poorly because they do not believe they usually perform poorly or do not want to admit to themselves that they are performing poorly because that would be inconsistent with their metacognitive world-view.",

We began exploring the neurophysiology of the DKE by examining brain activity for general differences in processing among the memory and metacognition tasks. That is, we assessed the generic extent to which these two judgment types could be established for reflecting different kinds of processing. ERPs between memory trials and self-estimate trials were found to differ reliably beginning from approximately 300 ms into the epoch and continuing throughout the epoch to 1200 ms at almost every electrode site but being maximal first at posterior parietal sites and then later at mid-frontal regions ( Figure 5 ). This pattern of ERPs is consistent with established properties of P300 ERP effects, or P3a and P3b effects, that are known to have the same distributions of topography and latency of across early/late and posterior/anterior regions, respectively, and which have been wellestablished as being associated with novelty processing or oddball tasks (Dien, Spencer, & Donchin, 2003; Otten & Donchin, 2009; Simons, et al., 2001) . This is consistent with the current paradigm in that the DKE judgments were uncommon trials that appeared among the common memory trials in the test, and would have been salient stimuli for eliciting an orienting effect of attention as a novelty item (Kishiyama, Yonelinas, & Lazzara, 2006; Knight, 1996; Knight & Donatella, 1998) .",

In such a model, familiarity would be seen as providing the foundational cognitive processing associated with a heuristic used by people unsure about the details of their past performance on the task and thus guiding them to erroneously over-estimate how well they think they did (over-guessing based upon it feeling familiar but lacking details; Whittlesea, 2002; Whittlesea & Williams, 2000; Whittlesea, 1993; Whittlesea, Jacoby, & Girard, 1990; Whittlesea & Leboe, 2003; Voss & Paller, 2010) . On the other hand, recollection would be seen as the cognitive process supporting people's abilities to correctly retrieve their memories of the past experiences with richness, detail, and contextual information bound together with the item of the episode (Diana et al., 2008; Eichenbaum et al., 2007) . Thus, having the cognitive process of recollection available would guide people to make self-assessments of performance that are more conservatively constrained by the details of the facts of that prior performance, thereby avoiding the same risk of incorrectly assuming an over-performance based merely on it seeming familiar acontextually. Taken together with the behavioral findings in RTs, it appears that overestimators were 'quick to brag', whereas the high-performers were slow to judge themselves as being best-and their caution was associated with better scores.",

Thus, subjects could have responded more quickly to items at encoding by virtue of their seeming more fluent. While these findings appear to indicate that overconfidence may have stemmed from enhanced fluency at encoding leading one to believe the information was more easily learned, it is challenged by the finding of their having the same response time as the correct-estimators did. Alternatively, it appears that under-estimators may have performed better due to having spent (slightly) more time learning information better, again supporting their later competence. Future work will benefit from empirical manipulations of fluency (e.g.: Leynes & Zish, 2012; Bader & Mecklinger, 2017; Bruett & Leynes, 2015; Leynes & Addante, 2016) and",

One possibility for the current results of group differences in ERPs during the performance estimates is that they may reflect differential decision making and evidence accrual among subjects (for a similar model, see Urai & Pfeffer, 2014 ) (we thank an anonymous Reviewer for pointing this out). By this account, over-estimators may have relied upon insufficient evidence accrual to make their hasty inaccurate decisions (consistent with the features of a familiarity-based signal detection process; Yonelinas et al., 2010; , whereas the under-estimators may have been slower to believe they were doing best because of evidence accrual occurring more slowly for a slower-growing integration signal (Summerfield & Tickle, 2015; Twomey et al., 2015) (consistent with a threshold model of recollection; Yonelinas et al., 2010; Parks & Yonelinas, 2009; Yonelinas & Parks, 2007) . The correlation results we found were consistent with this, in that larger P3 signal magnitudes for Dunning-Kruger decisions predicted higher performance estimates in the under-estimators, as they presumably had more accrued more evidence to support those judgments (Twomey et al., 2015; O'Connell et al., 2012; Boldt, 2019) .",

This possibility is speculative for now and lacks available data herein, and though intuitive it also runs counter to the current findings' caution of relying upon intuition for making estimates of conclusions.

First, to our knowledge, this is the only Dunning-Kruger experiment in which self-estimates on a task relative to a peer group were recorded repeatedly throughout the task, and which include physiological measures. Self-estimates in prior studies are usually only acquired once: at the end of the task (Adams & Adams, 1960; Burson, Larrick, & Klayman, 2006; Ehrlinger & Dunning, 2003; Kruger & Dunning, 1999; Oskamp, 1965; Pennycook, et al., 2017; Ryvkin, Kraj\u010d, & Ortmann, 2012a; Sanchez & Dunning, 2017) (although see Simons (2013) for instance of when there was a variation of the task using repeated estimates before the task itself). This innovation to the classic Dunning-Kruger paradigm was critical to collecting both the reaction time measures and neurophysiological measures of ERPs during the metacognitive self-estimates, and offers future researchers a pathway forward to continuing exploring this phenomenon.",

Because the over-estimators had a smaller LPC (in fact, lacked any LPC evidence at all, Figure 7 , 8), this suggests that they used less recollection during the episodic memory retrieval task. It is thereby reasonable to deduce that their memories for the episodic performance were diminished accordingly, leading to more metacognitive inaccuracies when trying to the recall episodic events related to their performance based purely upon the availability of familiarity. It is possible that this deficit may also be due to relatively more-impoverished encoding/learning in these subjects leading to relative differences in memory competency among the groups (Dunning, 2011) , which can be tested in future studies.",

Over-estimators had a larger ERP mean amplitude than under-estimators at mid-frontal electrode sites from 400-600 ms, which is the characteristic position and latency of the FN400 that has been synonymous with familiarity in many prior studies Curran, 2000; Friedman, 2013; Gherman & Philiastides, 2015; Rugg et al., 1998; Rugg & Curran, 2007) . In the framework of a memory-related interpretation of these results, one could argue that because we found an FN400 in this condition, over-estimators (under-performers) may have evidently used more familiarity than under-estimators did in making these metacognitive judgments, in lieu of the recollection that under-estimators (over-performers) were evidently relying upon instead. Evidently, each group was apparently arriving at fundamentally different metacognitive conclusions because they were relying upon, or being influenced by, fundamentally different neurocognitive processes of memory. This was mirrored in the behavioral data of reaction times, which revealed a crossover interaction pattern of responding: the over-estimators were quick to say they were best but slower to say they were worst, whereas the more 'humble' under-estimators were slower to say they performed best but faster to say they were worst-again suggesting fundamentally different cognitive processing between groups. This matched ERP findings that underestimators relied upon recollection instead of familiarity, whereas those who assumed they were doing better than they were actually doing relied upon familiarty instead of recollection.",

The current work maintains inherent limitations of all initial explorations: findings remain to be assessed for generalizability, tested for its boundary conditions, and independently investigated for replicability across other sample sizes and experimental variables. Some of our findings required relying upon relatively small sample sizes, and though the current paradigm has been previsouly found to be effective in seveal prior studies using even smaller sample sizes of neuropsychological patients Addante, 2015) , nevertheless, these findings should serve as preliminary discoveries to motivate future work exploring larger group sizes. It should be noted, though, that in attempting to characterize the effects of under-estimators, most people in the study exhibited overestimating errors, so the majority of our relatievly large sized sample of N = 61 were defined as not being in the under-estimator group that avoided these errors (indeed, this more pervasive illusory error was the prime focus of the current study and maintained a relatively large ERP sample size). Specified analyses looked at conditions that were rarely responded to, which further reduced certain sample sizes. Nevertheless, in exploring these effects we maintained rigiorous controls of inclusion criteria for trials to gain effective signal to noise ratio (see Methods), as is attested to by the reliable effects observed in the current work that small sample sizes inherently create a stronger challenge to achieve (which we did).",

Second, the study represents an integrative new paradigm that was developed to permit measuring multiple recurring trials of Dunning-Kruger metacognitive judgments, which others can now use to extend our understanding further. Third, this paradigmatic innovation made possible the ability to capture the DKE in a complex episodic memory task which extends the body of work on the DKE to episodic memory tasks of item and source memory confidence measures/paradigms. Together, these innovations revealed convergent insight into why people differ in this phenomenon. People who made the illusory errors of overestimating their performance did not have recollection-related processing supporting those memories and instead relied upon relatively less-accurate familiarity-based heuristics of intuition and fluency and were quicker to jump to those inaccurate conclusions. On the other hand, the more recollection signal (LPC) a subject had predicted the more likely they were to under-estimate their memory performance ( Figure   9 ). Recollection thus appeared to lead people to a more cautious and constrained metacognitive comparison to others. (Cross, 1977; Huang, 2013) while extending to leaders occupying both the highest and lowest offices. The basic premise of the DKE is thus seemingly a fundamental force that shapes our socio-psychological universe in similar ways that gravity shapes the backdrop of our physical universe-persisting through time and affecting everyone at some level. It takes work with self-awareness to avoid the pitfalls of illusory superiority, and surely benefits from practice. We show here that one way to do that is to avoid relying on intuition, fluency, and familiarity to make quick judgments; instead, results encourage relying on recollection of details and slower responses to reduce errors of illusory superiority. More experimentation is needed, but the present work identifies some of the cognitive processes involved in the errors that can lead to the leadership and safety hazards of over-and under-confidence in one's abilities. We hope that this research can serve to inspire new explorations endeavoring to discover the neural correlates of our psychological processes, towards a better understanding of ourselves and the truth of human behavior.",

During ERP averaging, trials exceeding ERP amplitudes of +/-250 mV were excluded.

Although the current paradigm has been previously established as being sensitive to small samples of the same sizesAddante, 2015), we nevertheless sought to increase the sample size of those who did not exhibit the errors of illusory superiority. Therefore, we collapsed the under-estimator group (N = 3) together with the available subjects of correct-estimators whom had responses in these otherwise-rare categories (N = 5) to create a larger group for analyses (N = 8); the over-estimators with available trials in these conditions were N = 23. We used a two-factor between-subjects ANOVA to determine if any mean differences existed among the reaction times for Dunning-Kruger groups (over-estimators vs. correct and under-estimators) while they judged themselves to be in the highest (response of '5') and lowest (response of '1') performance groups, respectively. The ANOVA revealed a significant condition by group interaction between Dunning-Kruger groups and responses, F(1,27) = 8.35, p = .008, which we explored with planned t-tests.Within-group, the reaction times for over-estimators when rating themselves asperforming in the worst (< 60 th ) percentile (DK response of '1'; M = 2204 ms, SD = 628 ms, N = 10) were significantly slower than when over-estimators rated themselves in as being in the best 90th percentile (DK response of '5'; M = 1656 ms, SD = 544 ms, N = 13), t(21) = 2.24, p = .04. Alternatively, the combined group of correct + underestimators exhibited RTs with the opposite pattern: showing a slower response time when rating themselves in the 90th percentile or above (M = 2457 ms, SD = 634 ms, N = 5) that was marginally faster when rating themselves as performing less than the 60th percentile (M = 1604 ms, SD = 329 ms, N = 3; t(6) = -2.12, p = .08) (Figure 4).

When looking early in time (400-600 ms) during the latencies characteristic of familiarity-based processing (FN400;Addante et al., 2012a,b;Rugg & Curran, 2007) a 2 x 2 repeated measures ANOVA with factors of Condition (ERP amplitudes for hits, correct rejections) and Group (over-estimators (N = 36), under-estimators (N = 10)) at mid-frontal site Fz revealed no significant effects of either factor or interaction. However, at the centro-parietal site Pz there was a significant main effect of Condition (F(1,46) = 5.63, p = .022) and a reliable condition x group interaction (F(1,44) = 5.0, p = .030). This was explored with a follow-up between-group t-test, Which found under-estimators had a significantly higher amplitude (M = 1.39, SD = 1.59) of old-new effects than over-estimators (M = 0.25, SD = 1.38) that occurred maximally at centro-parietal site Pz but was diffuse across several sites in the posterior scalp, t(44)= 2.24; p = .03. As this difference was evident in the parietal region instead of the expected left frontal region characteristic of the FN400, it may indicate an early activation of recollection activity but does not preclude other possible interpretations of its functional significance related to familiarity or implicit processing(Voss et al., 201;Voss & Paller, 2007;2017;Addante, 2015).Later in time, from 600-900 ms at left parietal site P3, a 2 x 2 repeated measures ANOVA with factors of Condition (ERP amplitudes for hits, correct rejections) and Group (over-estimators, under-estimators) from 600-900 ms at left parietal which revealed that the under-estimator group (M = 1.96, SD = 1.35) had significantly larger LPC effects (hit -correct rejection amplitudes) than the overestimator group (M = 0.30, SD = 1.72), t(44)= 2.81; p = .01 (Figure 6). This finding was similar across adjacent electrodes, and suggests that the under-estimator group, which consists of the highest performing individuals, relied on using more recollection than the over-estimator group did in making their memory judgments. Accordingly, since the illusory over-estimators constituted the lowest performing individuals, it is possible that one reason why they performed lower was because of a relative reduction in their reliance upon recollection.How do metacognitive judgments differ among good and bad, over-and underestimators? To investigate this core question, we analyzed group-level differences in ERPs between the over-and under-estimators by DKE judgment (all responses collapsed together). There were significant differences in ERP amplitude between the under-estimators and over-estimators at mid-frontal electrode Fz from 400-600 ms (MOver-Estimators = 4.16, SD = 5.09; MUnder-Estimators = 0.55, SD = 4.40; t(44) = -2.04, p",

For the under-estimator group, magnitude of the LPC effect was found to be correlated in the negative direction with the average Dunning-Kruger response given in-test by each subject (r = -.798, p = .006, N = 10) but did not exhibit any relationship for the over-estimators (r = -.014, p > .10, N = 36) (Figure 8), indicating that for the higher-performing under-estimators, LPC effects would reliably predict what the ensuing average Dunning-Kruger estimate of that subject would be for their estimated task performance, such that the larger LPC magnitudes predicted relatively lower performance estimates.",
