Identification of antigenic regions on pathogen proteins will play a pivotal role in designer vaccine immunotherapy. We have developed a system that not only identifies high binding T-cell antigenic epitopes, but also class I T-cell antigenic clusters termed immunological hot spots. Methods: MULTIPRED, a computational system for promiscuous prediction of HLA class I binders, uses artificial neural networks (ANN) and hidden Markov models (HMM) as predictive engines. The models were rigorously trained, tested and validated using experimentally identified HLA class I T-cell epitopes from human melanoma related proteins and human papillomavirus proteins E6 and E7. We have developed a scoring scheme for identification of immunological hot spots for HLA class I molecules, which is the sum of the highest four predictions within a window of 30 amino acids. Results: Our predictions against experimental data from four melanoma-related proteins showed that MULTIPRED ANN and HMM models could predict T-cell epitopes with high accuracy. The analysis of proteins E6 and E7 showed that ANN models appear to be more accurate for prediction of HLA-A3 hot spots and HMM models for HLA-A2 predictions. For illustration of its utility we applied MULTIPRED for prediction of promiscuous T-cell epitopes in all four SARS coronavirus structural proteins.

Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules play a vital role in the regulation of immune responses (Hudson and Ploegh, 2002; Watts and Amigorena, 2001) . Foreign and host proteins are degraded by specialized intracellular mechanisms to short antigenic peptides. The primary function of MHC molecules is to bind and present antigenic peptides on the cell surface for recognition by antigen-specific T-cell receptors (TCRs) of lymphocytes. These processing and presentation mechanisms are essential processes for cellular immune recognition of antigens. MHC class I peptides are primarily generated by the proteasome complex, and are translocated from the cytosol into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by a transporter associated with antigen processing. In the ER, peptides are loaded onto the MHC class I molecules and are exported to the cell surface for presentation to TCRs. Short peptides presented to TCRs, termed T-cell epitopes, are critical elements for understanding the basis of immunity (Parker et al., 1994; Van Kaer, 2002; Britschgi et al., 2003) . Precise identification of T-cell epitopes is a prerequisite for accurate epitope mapping and for design of vaccines and immunotherapies. Peptides that bind to more than one MHC allelic variant ('promiscuous peptides') are important because they are relevant to higher proportions of the human populations and are targets for vaccine and immunotherapy development.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 191, "end": 216, "text": "(Hudson and Ploegh, 2002;", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 217, "end": 243, "text": "Watts and Amigorena, 2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 1101, "end": 1122, "text": "(Parker et al., 1994;", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1123, "end": 1138, "text": "Van Kaer, 2002;", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 1139, "end": 1162, "text": "Britschgi et al., 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "Computational methods have been used for the prediction of T-cell epitopes and are now a standard methodology (Schirle et al., 2001; Yu et al., 2002) .

Immunological hot spots are thus defined as antigenic regions of up to 30 amino acids that are predicted to bind multiple HLA alleles.
