The efficiency of RNAi has largely supplant brought other nucleic acid based drugs out of focus, although the central problem remains efficient and long-term delivery of these novel drugs. Expansion of virus-specific T-cells and (re)targeting of immune cells to virus infected cells are further promising ways to enhance antiviral defence. Vaccination strategies based on DNA as well as on vectors like recombinant modified vaccinia virus have reached early clinical stages.",

Matth. 12:24 The feasibility of therapeutic gene transfer is widely accepted for cancer and genetic disease, and two thirds of human clinical trials were as yet performed in cancer patients. Herpesviruses, lentiviruses, papillomaviruses and hepatitis B and C viruses (HBV, HCV) all cause significant burden of disease in man. They establish persistent infections that are in many aspects similar to genetic disease or cancer, and several viruses are in fact cancerogenic. Similar attempts as in cancer gene therapy have thus been applied to viral infections, while the success of vaccination against infectious disease has on the other hand prompted studies to vaccinate against cancer. The majority of studies in humans that use gene transfer in infectious disease (about 7% of more than 1000 trials world wide) are HIV-related (68 of 72 registered trials on infectious disease, as of June 2005) ; the few others are on immunotherapy directed against Cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein Barr virus (EBV) and HCV (The Journal of Gene Medicine Clinical Trial Site, 2005; Office of Biotechnological Activities at NIH and the Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee, 2005) . The ingenuity of researchers has come up with an abundance of antiviral targeting strategies, including promising recent developments such as RNA interference, strategies to specifically direct an antiviral immune response toward infected cells, and vaccination procedures that involve gene-modified antigen presenting cells. Many techniques are still in a preclinical or conceptual stage. The major hurdle of most vectorbased approaches remains the delivery of the therapeutic principle to the transfer will more than likely remain an absolute exception in the foreseeable future, the viral foe will usually have a head start; in addition, for reasons of biosafety, the carefully controlled therapeutic vector has a fundamental disadvantage versus the spread of the infectious agent which is not hindered by such considerations.",

It was soon followed by a tragic setback when three children developed treatment-associated T-cell leukemia that was associated with LMO2 gene expression, very likely the consequence of insertional activation by the retroviral vector (Hacein-Bey-Abina et al., 2003; Kaiser, 2005) .",

Retroviral insertion mutagenesis had been observed previously in animal models; rhesus monkey infected by a retroviral vector contaminated with replication competent retrovirus developed T-cell leukemia (Donahue et al., 1992) , and (EIAV) based lentiviral vector (Themis et al., 2005) . Why have those side effects not been observed before? It has been estimated that in the French trial the number of retroviral insertion events exceeded those of all previous studies together. High vector dose, usage of a conventional vector with complete LTR, and the growth stimulatory properties of the transduced \u03b3c gene, plus increased viability and engraftment of gene-modified cells may in summary have precipitated the occurrence of side effects. Compared to the prognosis of SCID-X1 patients in which matched related donors are unavail-Dose-finding will be important, as is development/application of newer generations of retro-and lentiviral vectors that will improve the outcome. These are self-inactivating (SIN) due to deletion of the enhancer elements in the LTR U3 region and can therefore avoid the direct activation of genes in the vicinity of the integration site. Nevertheless, dose-dependent genotoxicity by insertional gene inactivation is likely associated with any integrating viral vector. Safety concern might be overcome by including suicide genes that allow ablation of vector-transduced cells.",

EBV integration has been occasionally described in cultured cell lines but is considered a rare event in vivo (Gulley et al., 1992; Delecluse et al., 1993) . Herpesviruses other than MDV do not regularly integrate and possess a number of attractive features such as large packaging capacity, a mechanism for active replication and segregation of the viral episome, a broad host range, and infection of non-dividing cells.

Exportin-5 together with its cofactor Ran-GTP transport pre-miRNAs to the cytoplasm, where they are processed by the RNAse III Dicer into mature 22-nucleotide duplex miRNAs. The Dicer containing complex processes long double-stranded RNA precursors into the small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) that mediate RNAi. Beginning at the dufuture mature miRNA (also called guide RNA). Unwound mature miRNAs are plex end with the lower thermodynamic stability, miRNA duplexes are unwound, and the miRNA strand that has its 5' terminus at this end is the then incorporated into a miRNA ribonucleoprotein complex analogous to the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). The miRNA/RISC then downregulate the target by translational inhibition or target mRNA cleavage. This is determined by the degree of complementarity between the miRNA and target gene, in combination with Argonaute proteins, which are present in RISC. All Argonaute proteins can bind miRNAs and siRNAs, and Argo-naute2 (eIF2C2) is the catalytic component of the RISC that mediates targeted RNA cleavage. Near-perfect complementarity results in cleavage, followed by general RNA degradation of the targets, while partial complementarity causes translational inhibition, though the exact mechanism for translational inhibition is not known. Translational inhibition seems more common than miRNA-directed cleavage in animals (reviewed in Wienholds and Plasterk, 2005 ; see also Chapter 1.3, Figure 5 ).

However, induction of the interferon system by the Toll-like receptor (TLR) pathway can result from recognition of byproducts of siRNA production or the specific siRNA itself. On the other hand, TLR pathway activation by a given siRNA can be experimentally ruled out in vitro and in vivo in various models, and has not been shown to interfere with the degree or specificity of RNA interference. More difficult to overcome, but possibly less severe, is the interference with off-target cellular RNAs that has been observed sporadically (Jackson et al., 2003; Scacheri et al., 2004) . The potential off-target effects of the respective therapeutic RNA must therefore be studied extensively in the homologous species, e.g. by genome-wide expression analysis. A further aspect is the evaluation of such strategies in vivo: the high sequence specificity of RNA interference will limit the predictive value of any preclinical animal model, since it is not unlikely that a given siRNA will find different off-targets in other host genetic backgrounds.",

Conditional expression of TK driven by the HIV-LTR has been shown to confer to infected cells a rather specific susceptibility to Ganciclovir mediated toxicity (Caruso and Bank, 1997; Miyake et al., 2001) . Transfer of TK via a HIV-based lentiviral vector was used to eliminate CD4 tumor cells from adult T-cell leukemia, which is caused by HTLV-I (Obaru et al., 1996) . A further possibility would be conditional expression of a toxin. This approach does not require a prodrug, but it is essential that undesired expression, in the absence of the inducing stimulus, does not occur under any circumstance.",

Further problems with nucleic-acid based therapies (antisense, RNAi, ribozymes) arise from the high mutation rate and enormous sequence variability of HIV-Quasispecies, which contrasts with the high sequence specificity of e.g. RNAi and ribozymes. It is predictable that resistant HIV-1 variants will arise rapidly in vivo. Selection of conserved sequences in the LTR or within leader sequences may partially avoid this evasion mechanism, as will simultaneously targeting of multiple essential HIV-1 sequences or of targeting essential host genes that do not mutate. RNA decoy requires overexpression of TAR-or RRE-Sequences (e.g. by Pol-III-transcription) but is also less susceptible to sequence variation, since it targets viral proteins. Ribozymes have enzymatic activity and are therefore only needed in smaller amounts than classical antisense strategies, though the natural mechanism of RNAi seems to require even smaller amounts of the therapeutic RNA-molecules (reviewed by Peracchi, 2004) .",

Impaired signaling capacity that does not achieve the appropriate signal strength in the right context, and lack corresponding costimulatory signals, could also lead to anergy or elimination. Enhanced receptor molecules have therefore been constructed that include functional domains from costimulatory molecules. The promising technique could also be improved by usage of humanized molecules, as well as transduction of cells with specificity against a strong antigen, such as EBV, to improve persistence (summarized in Brenner, 2003, 2004) .",

The altered specificity of T-bodies and heterodimeric TCR can possibly induce autoimmune side effects, though they have not been observed with the relatively small patient numbers treated to date. Lymphoproliferative syndrome can be caused by transduced cells that result from insertion mutagenesis by the vector; this danger might be partially overcome by self-inactivating vectors, by introduction of suicide genes to ablate the unwanted cells, or by gene transfer into mature cells that may be easier to eliminate than stem cells. Possible solutions could be preselection of transferred cells for integration sites, if suitable strategies can be developed. Immunogenicity or undesired behavior of suicide genes could be overcome by novel physiological suicide genes such as CD20 (for elimination by Rituximab, Introna et al., 2000) , or conditional proapoptotic molecules derived from endogenous genes (summarized in R\u00f6ssig and Brenner, 2004) .",

RNAand DNA-virus-based replicons that are under development for prophylactic and therapeutic vaccination are mostly targeted against HIV, viral hepatitis, HPV-associated cervical cancer (Chapter 2.5 by L. Gissmann), as well as toward more fashionable and recent threats such as SARS-CoV, Filovirus, and those relating to \"Biodefense\" (Lee et al., 2005) . The reader is referred to recent reviews focusing on Adenovirus- (Tatsis and Ertl, 2004) Alphavirus- (Lundstrom, 2001) , and DNA-vaccine vectors (Srivastava and Liu, 2003; Duenas-Carrera, 2004; Giri et al., 2004) . Vaccines based on Adenoviruses or on gene-modified poxviruses (Drexler et al., 2004; Moss, 1996) , such as modified Vaccinia strain Ankara (MVA), may be specifically considered in situations where adequate medical supply chains and financial resources do not exist. Vaccine formulations based on (lyophilized) DNA are also highly stable under adverse circumstances. The success of Variola elimination did crucially depend on the enormous stability, effectiveness and low cost of the Vaccinia virus. MVA-based vaccination trials showed good safety and immunogenicity of MVA expressing HIV Nef in HIV patients (Harrer et al., 2005) , and there is promising data on regression of precancerous cervical lesions in a preclinical study of MVA expressing HPV E2 (Corona Gutierrez et al., 2004) .",
