            "text": "Thrombocytopenia in calves is a well-known but rare disease which can have a variety of different causes [1]. In 2007 an accumulation of cases with severe haemorrhagic presentation was noted in Bavaria but consecutively also in other parts of Germany and in neighbouring countries. A Satellite Symposium of the European Buiatric Congress was dedicated to this new syndrome, henceforward termed Bovine Neonatal Pancytopenia (BNP). By end of December 2010 more than 4000 cases were reported for the EU with nearly 3000 cases in Germany (Cussler, unpublished observation). Clinical symptoms usually develop with the age of 10\u201320 days and comprise cutaneous bleeding, petechiae, and melena. In general 5 days after onset of clinical symptoms the patients succumb to blood loss and secondary infections [2]. The case fatality rate reaches up to 90% [3]. Haematologically, the syndrome is characterized by a marked pancytopenia, including thrombo- and leukocytopenia, and the pathognomonic finding at post-mortem is an aplasia of the bone marrow (panmyelophthisis) accompanied by extensive internal and/or external bleeding [3]. So far, most of the known causes of haemorrhagic symptoms in bovines such as toxins [1] or infectious agents [4], [5] in particular Bovine Viral Diarrhoea Virus (BVDV) and bluetongue virus have been ruled out [2], [3]. Kappe et al. discuss the involvement of Porcine Circovirus 2 (PCV-2) [6] but this has not been confirmed by others [7]. In addition, a small-scale study that we performed in collaboration with the Friedrich-Loeffler-Institute, the German Federal Institute for Animal Health, on samples from BNP calves and non-BNP calves from different regions of Germany provided no evidence for a causative role of PCV-2 (Schirrmeier, personal communication). The syndrome develops upon ingestion of colostrum and it can experimentally be reproduced when newborn calves are fed with colostrum of BNP dams, i.e. cows that gave birth to a BNP calf [8]. This is not strictly dependent on the genetic relationship between colostrum donor and calf, i.e. calves from other dams can develop symptoms upon ingestion of colostrum from a BNP dam and \u2013 vice versa \u2013 calves from BNP dams remain healthy if they receive foreign colostrum [9]. As a first measure against BNP it has therefore been suggested to discard the colostrum of BNP dams [10].",

            "text": "In cattle maternal antibodies are not transferred in utero due to the particular anatomy of the bovine placenta. Instead the supply with maternal antibodies is achieved via colostrum during the first hours of life. It has therefore been hypothesized that maternal antibodies \u201ctoxic\u201d for blood and bone marrow cells of the calf are the decisive component that induces BNP. Alloimmune phenomena are well described in humans and other species: one example is Neonatal Alloimmune Thrombocytopenia (NAIT). Women homozygous for a certain single nucleotide polymorphism may develop anti Human Platelet Antigen 1 antibodies when they are pregnant with a heterozygous foetus. During a subsequent gravidity these antibodies traverse the placental barrier and cause thrombocytopenia and subsequent intracranial haemorrhage in the foetus. The syndrome occurs with a frequency of about 1 in 1000 pregnancies [11]. In contrast to NAIT, which is known since decades [12], the first cases retrospectively recognised as BNP occurred in 2005 in Germany and in Belgium the first cases were traced back to 2006 (Cussler, unpublished observation). It is therefore unlikely, that BNP is due to natural sensitisation, i.e. through contact with foetal blood cells as is the case for NAIT, because then the syndrome should have been observed much earlier. The occurrence of BNP after 2005 and the spreading to some, but not all neighbouring states was a remarkable feature of the disease.",

            "text": "First epidemiological investigations revealed that the farms affected by BNP regularly performed vaccinations against BVD [2]. This was confirmed by pharmacovigilance investigations in Germany and also at the EU level. These investigations demonstrated that the vast majority of BNP cases is associated with one particular BVD vaccine, PregSure\u00aeBVD, which was further corroborated by the observation, that the occurrence of BNP is restricted to EU member states where the vaccine was marketed. Taking the growing evidence for an involvement of the vaccine into account, the Marketing Authorisation Holder announced a marketing stop for PregSure\u00aeBVD in April, 2010 for Germany [13]. In July 2010 the European Medicines Agency (EMA) recommended to suspend the marketing authorisation for PregSure\u00aeBVD \u201cuntil scientific evidence is available to demonstrate that the administration of the vaccine \u2026 does not lead to an increased risk of Bovine Neonatal Pancytopenia or that risk mitigation measures \u2026 can be implemented\u201d [14]. As the National Competent Authority of the Reference Member State that issued the first marketing authorisation [15] the Paul-Ehrlich-Institute (PEI) set out to investigate the role of PregSure\u00aeBVD in the pathogenesis of BNP. In particular, we wanted to address: (i) whether alloreactive antibodies could account for the induction of BNP, (ii) whether such alloantibodies could be functionally relevant, and (iii) whether PregSure\u00aeBVD could be involved in the induction of such antibodies.",

Sera from BNP dams were obtained by venipuncture and transferred within 24 h for further investigation to the PEI. All BNP dams had received at least two vaccinations with PregSure\u00aeBVD according to the recommended vaccination scheme and most of them received booster vaccinations. Additional sera from BNP dams were provided by a veterinary practice in the northern part of Hesse and by the Clinics of Internal Medicine and Surgery of Ruminants of the Veterinary Faculty in Munich. The same case definitions as described above apply to these samples. Control sera were sampled from a dairy herd that had not been vaccinated against BVD, from a herd that had been vaccinated with a different inactivated BVD vaccine and from a herd that had been vaccinated with PregSure\u00aeBVD but had so far no history of BNP cases. The complete vaccination history of all animals included in this study is available to the authors.

To this end, we incubated calf leukocytes with sera from BNP dams and respective control groups and assessed binding of a FITC conjugated secondary antibody by flow cytometry. Fig. 2\nshows that sera from BNP dams contain antibodies, which bind extracellular antigens on bovine leukocytes. The gating strategy, based on forward- and sideward-scatter (see Fig. 2A, upper left panel) allows to differentiate between lymphocytes, monocytes and granulocytes. This differentiation was confirmed by a predominant staining (80%) for the T lymphocyte marker CD3 in the lymphocyte gate (L\u00a2) and a predominant staining for CD14 (90%) \u2013 a characteristic marker of monocytes and macrophages \u2013 in the monocyte gate (M\u00a2) (Fig. 2A, upper middle and right panel). The alloreactive binding is strongest in lymphoid cells. Monocytes and granulocytes are bound to a lesser extent (Fig. 2A, lower panel). This observation is well in accordance with previous publications [20], [21]. Within the different cell populations the respective alloantigen(s) are evenly distributed as seen by the general shift of the fluorescence intensity. Since alloreactive binding was predominantly observed in lymphocytes and monocytes, from here on we concentrated on the analysis of these populations. When comparing alloreactive binding between the different groups it is of note that only sera of animals that received a PregSure\u00aeBVD immunization show alloreactivity (Fig. 2B) and the binding is significantly higher in BNP dams compared to non-BNP-dams. Still, there are large differences when sera of individual BNP dams are compared (Fig. 2B, right scatter plot). In part this is due to differences in alloantibody titres, but it also reflects heterogeneity in the specificity of alloantibodies. This becomes obvious when sera of BNP dams are tested against lymphocytes from different donors. In Fig. 2C, we tested a panel of seven BNP sera with PHA blasts from three different donors. Lymphocytes from donor A are bound by all BNP sera, one BNP serum does not react with donor B, and cells from donor C are only recognised by sera of three BNP dams, indicating that alloantibodies from individual BNP dams recognize different epitopes or antigens. Furthermore, this shows that the expression of alloantigens differs between individuals. In this context it is remarkable, that donor C is a calf that survived a challenge with colostrum from a non-related BNP dam. The serum of the corresponding BNP dam did not bind leukocytes of donor C (data not shown). To test for their specificity we investigated BNP dam sera together with the respective controls by western blot (Fig. 2D). Whole cell lysates of PHA blasts were separated by SDS-PAGE and blotted on nitrocellulose membranes: With sera from five of eight BNP dams and with three of eight PregSure\u00aeBVD immunized Non-BNP dams a reactive band at about 50 kDa was observed. Although we did not observe this reactivity in animals that had not been vaccinated with PregSure\u00aeBVD, the western blot analysis remains somewhat inconclusive, because there was no correlation with the flow cytometry signal obtained with the respective serum (data not shown).",

After over night incubation cells were analyzed by flow cytometry. As seen in Fig. 3\nA, the two cell populations can easily be distinguished (left panel). The uptake of cellular material from target cells leads to an increase of green fluorescence in the upper macrophage gate.

To this end we first immunized guinea pigs with four different commercially available BVD vaccines. Again, two experimental approaches were chosen to test for alloreactive antibodies: Western blotting revealed that the three inactivated BVD vaccines tested induced an almost identical pattern of reactive bands when sera of immunized guinea pigs were tested against whole cell lysates of bovine PHA blasts, whereas the one live attenuated BVD vaccine induced no significant alloreactivity (Fig. 4\nA). Using this technique the reactivity to the total of cellular proteins is detected. By contrast, flow cytometry allows for the analysis of antibodies that bind native antigens on the cell surface. Fig. 4B reveals that only sera of PregSure\u00aeBVD immunized guinea pigs showed surface staining of bovine lymphocytes, which is in accordance with the missing correlation between Western blot and flow cytometry observed with bovine sera (see Fig. 2). To investigate the induction of alloreactive antibodies in the target species two calves were vaccinated four times with PregSure\u00aeBVD in 3 weeks intervals. At the indicated time points serum was collected and tested by flow cytometry for alloreactivity (Fig. 4C): the bovine kidney cell line used for the production of PregSure\u00aeBVD and bovine lymphocytes were tested in parallel. The upper panel shows the reactivity to the cell line. In dependence of the number of immunizations, both animals develop cell line specific antibodies. The lower panel shows the alloreactivity to heterologous, bovine PHA blasts. The reactivity follows a very similar pattern as observed with the kidney cell line, but in this case, only one of two calves is responding. Together these data show that PregSure\u00aeBVD is able to induce alloreactive antibodies specific for surface antigens both on the cell line used for virus production and on bovine lymphocytes.",

For this purpose we affinity-purified alloantibodies by eluting cell-bound antibodies from the surface of bovine lymphocytes as it has previously been described [22]. The eluates were retested for alloreactive binding on bovine lymphocytes and showed a tenfold increase in alloreactive binding when compared to the corresponding sera. This effect was only observed with sera from BNP dams (Fig. 5\nA) and PregSure\u00aeBVD immunized non-BNP dams (Supplemental Fig. 3). It was not observed with non-immunized controls (Fig. 5A) or animals vaccinated with another BVD vaccine (Supplemental Fig. 3). To exclude the possibility that the vaccine-induced alloreactivity is due to cross-reactive viral antigens we tested the same panel of sera and affinity purified alloantibodies by SNT. Again, sera from BNP dams showed very high BVDV-neutralizing antibody titres. With affinity-purified alloantibodies this neutralizing effect was completely abolished (Fig. 5B) indicating that PregSure\u00aeBVD-induced alloantibodies are different from BVDV-specific antibodies detected in the SNT. Finally, we tested BNP associated alloantibodies eluted from bovine lymphocytes for their capacity to bind a panel of cell lines commonly used in vaccine production. No cross-reactivity of affinity-eluates was observed with hamster or rabbit kidney cell lines. Some reactivity was observed with a bovine lung cell line used for the production of a BVD vaccine other than PregSure\u00aeBVD, but it must be emphasized that this vaccine did not induce leukocyte-binding antibodies in guinea pigs (see also Fig. 4B). The strongest binding was observed with the bovine kidney cell used for PregSure\u00aeBVD production (Fig. 5C) showing that BNP associated alloantibodies cross-react with cell surface antigens both on bovine leukocytes and on the cell line.",

            "text": "In comparison to live attenuated vaccines, inactivated vaccines are usually considered safe but less effective. Therefore, a lot of effort is invested into research on and development of new adjuvants to improve the efficacy of inactivated vaccines. Adverse effects of inactivated vaccines in veterinary medicine are usually restricted to local reactions mainly due to irritating properties of the adjuvant and sometimes mild systemic reactions such as fever or milk reduction. Autoimmune reactions induced by licensed vaccines have been described for humans [23] and are discussed for pet animals [23] but have very rarely been reported for livestock animals [24]. Nevertheless, there are reports on alloimmune haemolytic anaemia in calves that ingested colostrum of cows vaccinated with experimental vaccines against anaplasmosis [25] demonstrating that vaccine-induced maternal antibodies can lead to alloimmune-pathology in bovine neonates [26]. The data presented here provide strong evidence that a similar immune-mediated mechanism may account for the pathogenesis of BNP. The observed association between BNP in the calf and the presence of alloreactive antibodies in the serum of the dam is an important hint and well in accordance with findings of other research groups [27]. These alloantibodies are transferred to the calf through colostrum-uptake, because it has recently been reported that calf leukocytes are coated with alloantibodies shortly after ingestion of colostrum from BNP dams [20]. Little is known about the pathomechanism that causes the typical cytopenia and panmyelophthisis leading to the clinical symptoms of BNP. However, in the current manuscript we demonstrate in vitro that alloreactive BNP sera induce cytophagocytosis by bovine macrophages. In addition, activated macrophages and haemophagocytosis have repeatedly been reported in bone marrow aspirates of BNP calves [3], [20]. It is therefore very likely that \u2013 similar to human alloimmune thrombocytopenia [28] \u2013 activated phagocytes of the Reticulo-Endothelial-System eliminate alloantibody-opsonized cells through Fc-receptor mediated phagocytosis. Nevertheless, it is conceivable that other immune-mechanisms such as Antibody Dependent Cellular Cytotoxicity (ADCC) or complement activation also contribute to the pathogenesis of BNP. Further investigations are required to clarify this issue.",

            "text": "Another important question is how BNP associated alloantibodies are elicited. Epidemiological observations revealed that almost all BNP dams share a common vaccination history [2]. However, to the best of our knowledge this is the first report directly addressing the potential role of the vaccine, PregSure\u00aeBVD, in the pathophysiology of BNP. The vaccine is manufactured like other conventional, inactivated BVD vaccines: virus is produced on a bovine kidney cell line, harvested and inactivated. A particular feature is the microfluidized oil-in-water adjuvant system named Procision-A\u00ae, which is composed of Quil-A, Cholesterol, Amphigen Base and Drakeol 5 [29]. Due to the unique adjuvant the vaccine induces very robust, protective antibody titres against BVDV type 1 and type 2 [18], [19], [30]. This is well confirmed by the data presented in the current manuscript. However, in addition to protective immunity the vaccine also induces alloreactive antibodies and the source of alloantigens \u2013 as seen from the cross-reactivity experiments \u2013 is the cell line used for vaccine production. Using two different techniques \u2013 western blotting and flow cytometry \u2013 we were able to discriminate an overall alloreactivity to whole cell lysates of bovine leukocytes from alloantibodies that are specific for cell surface molecules. With sera from BVD immunized cows only a few reactive bands were observed by western blot (Fig. 2D). By contrast, all sera from guinea pigs that had been vaccinated with inactivated BVD vaccines displayed strong and almost identical reactivity pattern (Fig. 4A). This indicates that all inactivated BVD vaccines tested in our experiments have the potential to induce alloreactivity, because they all contain a similar amount of residual bovine antigens originating from the manufacturing process. The difference in the western blot reactivity between cattle and guinea pigs is probably due to the fact that for guinea pigs the cellular antigens in the vaccine represent xenoantigens that readily elicit an immune response, whereas cattle recognize the majority of these bovine antigens as self and therefore mount no or only a weak immune response. The relevance of western blot reactive alloantibodies is unclear at the moment. Since there is no correlation of western blot reactivity with the flow cytometry signal western blot reactive antibodies are presumably directed to cytoplasmic proteins or hidden epitopes not accessible on living cells. Therefore they are probably clinically irrelevant. Nevertheless, it is conceivable that Western blot detectable alloantibodies are paralleled by alloreactive T cells of the same specificity, which could recognize their respective epitope in the context of MHC molecules and therefore could play a role in vivo, but so far there is no evidence that this has clinical implications. It is therefore assumed that only surface binding alloantibodies are clinically relevant, also because the pathomechanisms discussed above depend on a surface opsonization of cells. In view of the strong western blot reactivity observed with the different groups of guinea pig sera it is therefore remarkable that only PregSure\u00aeBVD immunized animals \u2013 guinea pigs and cattle \u2013 developed surface binding antibodies detectable by flow cytometry. So far, the reason for this difference is not clear. One possible explanation is that the surface exposed, BNP associated alloantigens are poorly immunogenic and require a highly efficient adjuvant and/or repeated booster immunizations before an alloimmune response is mounted. Alternatively, it could be that the immunogenicity of these alloantigens depends on a conformational stabilization by the microfluidized oil-in-water adjuvant, as it has been similarly described for conformational epitopes of influenza virus [31]. This clearly awaits further investigation, but according to these two non-mutually exclusive possibilities, a key problem could be the combination of the highly potent adjuvant with inadequately purified virus antigens. Since SDS-PAGE inevitably leads to a partial protein denaturation the importance of a native epitope conformation for alloantibody recognition would also explain, why there is no correlation between the reactivity in the western blot and flow cytometry as discussed for Fig. 2D and also why affinity purified alloantibodies eluted from the surface of bovine leukocytes have found to be non-reactive when tested by western blot (Bastian, unpublished observation). So far, this technical problem has impeded our attempts to identify individual BNP associated alloantigens. However, ongoing efforts \u2013 at the PEI but also in other institutions \u2013 will eventually succeed and it may be awaited that the identification of individual alloantigens will provide an explanation for the differences in alloantibody binding between individual leukocyte subsets. Similarly, the identification of alloantigens will also be important for the interpretation of the heterogeneous recognition pattern shown in Fig. 2C when sera of BNP-dams were tested against lymphocytes from different donors. The result is well in accordance with previous observations using freshly isolated leukocytes from newborn calves [20]. The authors of this previous publication discuss the possibility that the observed heterogeneity could be age related or due to temporary differences in the expression level of alloantigens. Here, we have used uniformly cultivated lymphocytes of adult or adolescent animals to exclude an influence of such variables. In addition, the experiments shown in Supplemental Fig. 1 provide no evidence for age related differences. Together with the findings shown in Supplemental Fig. 2 our observation therefore allows for the conclusion that individual BNP dams respond to different alloantigens (or different alleles of the same polymorphic antigen) and also that the expressed alloantigens vary from individual to individual. In light of this observation it is likely that more than one alloantigen can serve as a target for BNP inducing alloantibodies. So far, our assay system focused on the analysis of leukocytes, but it could well be that other important alloantigens are expressed by different cell types, e.g. thrombocytes or bone marrow cells (see below). To avoid this experimental bias, we have now started to focus on the bovine kidney cell line used for vaccine production. Since the cell line is presumably the origin of BNP associated alloreactivity, this strategy will allow us to cover the whole spectrum of BNP associated alloantigens. This is illustrated by the example given in Supplemental Fig. 3, where BNP-associated alloantibodies have been purified by desorbing them from the cell surface of the cell line.",

            "text": "The Western blot experiments with immune sera from guinea pigs showed that the vaccine (among others) contains a whole array of bovine cell antigens that have the potential to sensitise vaccinated animals. The repertoire of autoantigens expressed by the vaccinated animal and the respective auto-tolerance mechanisms \u2013 i.e. negative T- and B-cell selection in the thymus and bone marrow as well as peripheral tolerance induction \u2013 probably dictate which of these antigens are ignored and which elicit an alloreactive immune response. In other words, from the alloantigen cocktail in the vaccine the animals will only \u201cpick up\u201d non-self antigens. For the development of BNP it depends whether the cell surface antigens of the calf \u2013 inherited from the father \u2013 match those that have been \u201cpicked up\u201d as non-self by the mother. This concept of alloreactivity and self-tolerance is supported by the observation that sera of BNP dams do not bind autologous leukocytes (Supplemental Fig. 2). It is conceivable that the self-tolerance may occasionally be broken, but in the majority of cases it will prevent the development of autoimmunity. This also provides a plausible explanation why vaccinated animals do not show clinical symptoms despite high bovine specific antibody titres. In fact, PregSure\u00aeBVD has been considered very safe during the licensing procedure and is still recommended as being \u201csafe to administer at any stage of pregnancy\u201d according to the summary of product characteristics (SPC). However, a recent report casts doubt on the latter statement: The author describes an outbreak of BNP in a large dairy herd after the BVD management had been changed. To obtain a rapid onset of protection against BVD infection of dams it was decided to vaccinate all cows and heifers only once (instead of two injections recommended for basic vaccination) but to administer all dams a booster immunization with PregSure\u00aeBVD in high pregnancy when they were dried off. This change in the vaccination regimen led to a marked increase in calf mortality rate and in eight cases BNP could be confirmed by post-mortem [32]. The vaccination scheme used in this report is comparable to dam vaccinations intended to maximise antibody transfer to the offspring, e.g. to prevent neonatal scours caused by Escherichia coli or rota and corona virus infections. Taking this into account, the report suggests that a maximum alloantibody titre at delivery increases the risk to induce BNP. Together this corroborates the notion that the development of BNP depends on titre and specificity of ingested alloantibodies and the respective alloantigen expression in the calf.",

By contrast, even for Germany \u2013 the country with the highest number of BNP cases so far \u2013 the incidence of BNP after PregSure\u00aeBVD immunization has been estimated to be not higher than 0.3% (Cussler, unpublished observation) and on farms affected by BNP usually not more than 5\u201310% of the dams actually induce BNP (Holsteg, unpublished observation). Additional factors may therefore influence the clinical outcome of alloantibody ingestion. For example, there could be differences in the expression pattern of BNP associated alloantigens between relevant cell populations that are not detectable with the flow cytometric analysis of leukocytes alone. Subclinical cases of BNP have been reported that exhibited only a temporary depression in thrombocyte or leukocyte counts (Holsteg, unpublished observation, [3]). It was concluded that clinical symptoms only occur after prolonged cytopenia and that the prognosis quoad vitam depends on the degree of bone marrow destruction [2]. In this line we were able to demonstrate significant cross-reactivity of affinity-purified alloantibodies from BNP dams with cells from calf bone marrow aspirates (see Supplemental Fig. 3B). So far we have not investigated this systematically, but it is well conceivable that the key event in the immunopathology of BNP is the binding of PregSure\u00aeBVD induced alloantibodies and as a consequence the destruction of haematopoietic progenitor cells. Apart from these immunological aspects, there are of course additional variables such as colostrum management (e.g. mixed colostrum), the amount of colostrum intake, the timepoint of colostrum feeding, etc. that may affect the extent of pancytopenia and bone marrow damage which could explain the broad spectrum of reactions ranging from lethal haemorrhage to subclinical disease or even no obvious effect on blood cells.",

This is in accordance with the hypothesis that BNP is induced by alloreactive, maternal antibodies transferred by colostrum intake. Comparing the antibody binding to leukocyte preparations from different animals we find that alloantibodies from individual BNP dams may recognize different (sets of) antigens. Alloantibody binding is functionally relevant because it induces cytophagocytosis by bovine macrophages. With two different immunization approaches we demonstrate that PregSure\u00aeBVD \u2013 in contrast to other commercially available BVD vaccines \u2013 induces alloantibodies specific for surface antigens on bovine leukocytes. Finally, we show that the same alloantibodies that bind bovine leukocytes cross-react with the bovine kidney cell line used for PregSure\u00aeBVD production. By contrast, no cross-reactivity is observed with BVDV or with cell lines that are used for the manufacturing of other vaccines, e.g. vaccines used for mass vaccinations during the recent Bluetongue epidemic in Central Europe. Together our data provide strong evidence that repeated vaccination with PregSure\u00aeBVD is involved in the induction of BNP associated alloantibodies. Yet, there are still a number of issues that need to be addressed. This comprises the role of the adjuvant, the identity of alloantigens, and last but not least the difference between alloreactive BNP and non-BNP dams has to be elucidated. Ongoing efforts are aiming to resolve these open questions. The answers should help to prevent similar incidents in the future.",

Subsequently, target cells were cocultured with red fluorescent bovine macrophages. The uptake of green target cells was measured by flow cytometry. (A) A typical dot blot is shown: the macrophage gate includes all red fluorescent cells, double fluorescent cells are considered as macrophages after phagocytosis of green target cells. For the left panel target cells were incubated with serum from a non-immunized control, for the right panel target cells were incubated with serum from a BNP dam. (B) The quantitative analysis for one representative experiment of four is shown: columns represent the mean percentage of green macrophages for three control sera and three BNP sera, resp. Error bars depict the standard deviation. P-Values were calculated by simple Student's t-test.",

Black dots represent the MFI of PHA blasts from a 1-year-old heifer after staining with individual immune sera, black bars indicate the median value for each group. P-Values were calculated by simple Student's t-test. (B) Two calves were vaccinated four times with PregSure\u00aeBVD.
