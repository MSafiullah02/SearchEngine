This virus affects the respiratory system of a person and creates white patchy shadows in the lungs. Deep learning is one of the most effective Artificial Intelligence techniques to analyse chest X-ray images for efficient and reliable COVID-19 screening. In this paper, we have proposed a Deep Convolutional Neural Network method for fast and dependable identification of COVID-19 infection cases from the patient chest X-ray images. To validate the performance of the proposed system, chest X-ray images of more than 150 confirmed COVID-19 patients from the Kaggle data repository are used in the experimentation. The results show that the proposed system identifies the cases with an accuracy of 93%.",

The total number of confirmed and fatal COVID-19 cases in some of the highly affected countries are shown in Fig. 1 .

The clinical symptoms of COVID-19 infection includes respiratory tract illness, severe viral pneumonia with respiratory failure [18] . F. Zhou et al. [18] made a survey of 813 adult patients who were hospitalised in Wuhan Pulmonary Hospital and found that most of the patients who died were male. Different diseases were present in nearly half of the cases, hypertension being the most common, followed by coronary heart disease and diabetes. The regular symptoms on hospital admission were cough and high fever, followed by sputum production and fatigue. In a serious situation, the infection can cause pneumonia, multi-organ failure, and even death [8] . The infection of COVID-19 virus can easily be identified by using the X-ray of chest. A chest X-ray shows multiple white patchy shadows in both the lungs of a COVID-19 affected person [17] . Artificial Intelligence (AI) with image processing could be an efficient and accurate technique to differentiate this normal and affected chest X-ray images with good accuracy. It has the potential to improve the speed of COVID-19 case identification and reduce its spread particularly in resource-constraint environments where expert radiologist and high-end medical equipment are not available for early diagnosis and management of patients [10] .",

[15] developed a ResNet architecture and a CNN architecture respectively to detect COVID-19 infection from 76 and 50 confirmed chest X-ray images respectively. In both of these experiments, they directly applied the feature extraction and classification processes to the raw images without any segmentation and removal of the artifacts. How-ever both of these steps are very important to reduce the false COVID-19 alarm. Nevertheless, all these contributions provide motivation to use AI techniques in identifying diseases accurately with lesser time and without any human expert intervention.",

The analysis revealed that 12% of the total patients died with an average age of 65.4 years. In that dataset, 59% of the total COVID-19 patients were male and the remaining 41% were female. Fever and cough were the most prominent characteristics of COVID-19 patients being available with 95% and 71% cases respectively. It was also observed that 95% of patients who died had fever whereas 80% had pneumonia. As shown in Table. 2, the average time from illness onset to hospital admission was high in case of death patient compared to discharged patient. In addition to these clinical symptoms, COVID-19 also shows its effect on lungs. A detail comparison of normal and COVID-19 patient lungs has been shown in Fig. 2 . It clearly shows the white patchy ground-glass shadows present in the lungs of COVID-19 patient. H. Chen et al. [1] performed a study on lungs of nine different corona patients.

Proper segmentation of medical images is an essential step in disease identification by identifying the region of interest, locating the tumor, measuring the tissue volume, etc. In this research, we have segmented the chest X-ray images based on the gray level thresholding as the lungs of a COVID-19 patient contains many white patches. All the gray regions are separated from others by converting gray pixels into white pixels and remaining into black pixels. In this way, one can easily differentiate the normal and abnormal chest X-ray images. Segmentation of normal and COVID-19 patient lungs images are shown in Fig.   Fig. 4 : Removal of noise from chest X-ray image using Gaussian filter.

The identification process is based on the presence of a white patchy shadow in the lungs. For proper detection, we have pre-processed all the images by segmenting the important lungs section from the others. Before segmentation, we have cleared all the artifacts using the Gaussian filter. In this experiment, a threshold-based segmentation is done to separate gray pixels from the others. During the segmentation, we have set the threshold value into 30. In noise removal step, the image quality has increased from SNR 4 dB to 10 dB. The output of segmentation has shown in Fig. 5 , where we have clearly separated the gray pixels from the white pixels. From the segmentation results, it is also clear that the number of gray pixels in Covid-19 affected lungs is very less compared to the normal lungs. After segmentation, features were extracted from the segmented images using the above mentioned CNN architecture and finally all the extracted features were fed into the softmax classifier for the detection. During the experiment, the dataset was divided into two parts where 80% was kept for training and the remaining 20% was used for testing. The experimental results of our proposed system during training and testing has shown in Table. 4. To analyse the performance of our proposed system, we have used a confusion matrix as shown in Fig. 9 .
