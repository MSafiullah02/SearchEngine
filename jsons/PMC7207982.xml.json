You have rightly stated in your reply that internal hernia is a common cause of obstruction after Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and can present with non-specific symptoms. In the pre-COVID era, most of us would have agreed that laparoscopy with/without a preceding abdominal CT would be an acceptable way to proceed if there was a reasonable index of suspicion with regard to an internal hernia. With regard to pauci-symptomatic patients, recent evidence supports that a CT abdomen on its own is a good first line of investigation and is highly accurate [1].",

To illustrate, 7507 publications have emerged on this subject in just under 4 months [2], with 13 publications mentioning the phrase \u201cabdominal pain\u201d during this time. You have very rightly commented that non-specific abdominal symptoms such as anorexia, vomiting, diarrhoea and abdominal pain are not uncommon with COVID infection. It would thus be reasonable to exclude COVID infection in the differential diagnosis of abdominal symptoms for a patient with priory history of a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass.",

The guidelines also suggest that \u201cAny patient undergoing abdominal CT scan should also have CT chest\u201d. These guidelines have also been endorsed by all the other surgical Colleges and Royal College of Radiologists.",

This algorithm is a not only pragmatic but also evidence based and should reduce the risk of negative laparoscopy/laparotomy in this group of patients. I hope this view is shared by the wider bariatric community and is endorsed as a modified management algorithm for patients suspected of internal hernia in the current times. Once again, many thanks for bringing this to the attention of the bariatric community.",
