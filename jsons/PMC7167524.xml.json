Since the anthrax attacks of 2001, the nation has been preparing to respond to two forms of bioterrorism: covert and overt attacks. Covert attacks would normally be characterized as silent releases of a biological agent into a population, which later would correspond to many patients presenting to clinics and hospital emergency departments with a similar clinical syndrome. In this setting, syndromic surveillance is of paramount importance. Indeed, there may be several indicators for a covert act of bioterrorism.

The biological challenge, whether overt or covert, poses one of the most difficult set of circumstances for response organizations to tackle. Local community government officials know that they have limited ability to respond to the release of a biological agent, be it overt or covert. Frankly, it would be prohibitively expensive for all communities, especially small ones, to build the critical mass needed for them to effectively recognize the problem, respond, contain the outbreak, and treat the casualties. Most state governments have built a capacity for dealing with the biological challenge, but they lack the resources needed to contain widespread outbreaks. For this reason the federal government has accepted the responsibility of building critical infrastructure to recognize the threat and effectively deal with it.Critical ThinkingThe 2001 Amerithrax incident was both covert and overt. Covertly, anthrax spores were sent to the AMI building in Boca Raton, Florida, without obvious notification that the act had taken place. The incident led to two cases of inhalation anthrax. The letters sent to government officials and media moguls contained a note that informed the victims that they had been attacked with \u201canthrax.\u201d Why did the perpetrator act first covertly and then overtly about a week later?\n",

Bush signed a bill to provide funding for Project BioShield, an effort jointly directed by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the HHS (see Fig. 12.2\n). BioShield is intended to provide medical countermeasures to protect the American public from chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear (CBRN) attacks. Project BioShield legislation was the result of a bipartisan effort in response to the catastrophic events of September 11, 2001, and the anthrax and ricin attacks directed against members of Congress and other Americans. The BioShield project has three primary goals. First, the project authorized funds to purchase and stockpile vaccines aimed at countering specific biothreat agents. Second, the project authorized funding for increased research and development of new pharmaceuticals for the diseases caused by specific biothreat pathogens. Third, the project proposed sweeping changes in government authorization regarding medical response to a bioterror crisis and the approval processes for new drugs and vaccines (Marek, 2007).\nProject BioShield SummaryProject BioShield institutes a secure funding source for the purchase of critical medical countermeasures, such as vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics. Project BioShield authorizes $5.6 billion in funding over 10 years for the advanced development and purchase of high-priority medical countermeasures. This \u201cspecial reserve fund\u201d was provided in the fiscal year (FY) 2004 DHS Appropriations Act and becomes available to the Secretary of HHS for procurements after interagency and White House approval. The Office of Public Health Emergency Countermeasures has authority for all procurement activities for Project BioShield. Acquisitions under Project BioShield are restricted to products in development that are potentially licensable within 8 years from the time of contract award (Russell, 2007).\n",

Project BioShield was intended to remove some of the uncertainties that companies face in producing these drugs.

However, it was quickly realized that other agents, such as radiological agents, nuclear agents, and nerve agents, should also be encompassed within Project BioShield. At the conclusion of 2011, Project BioShield had paid for the delivery of 28.75 million doses of BioThrax, which is the only FDA-approved anthrax vaccine, and 107,560 doses of an antitoxin for botulism (Scheidmiller, 2012). Although the number of doses of the botulism antitoxin are well below the 200,000 originally ordered in 2006, the HHS decided that the 107,560 doses received were sufficient (Roos, 2012). However, HHS has continued to receive additional deliveries of botulism antitoxins through 2013 (US DHHS, 2014). Refer to Table 12.2\nfor a summary of funds spent on primary WMD concerns.",

The market for developing medical countermeasures is typically a high-cost, high-risk market (Russell, 2007).

The annual appropriations process further complicates these factors as long-term fund availability becomes questionable, at best. Project BioShield provided a long-term financial incentive to manufacturers to develop the products needed for defense against CBRN threats (Russell, 2007). To date, 12 new products have been added to the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS) to address anthrax, botulism, smallpox, and other CBRN threats (US DHHS, 2014). This includes 4.8 million doses of potassium iodide and 437,710 doses of intravenous calcium/zinc diethylenetriamine pentaacetate for radionuclear threats; 920,000 ST-246 vaccines and 20,864,000 Imvamune MVA smallpox vaccines; 138,749 doses of botulinum antitoxin; 28,750,000 doses of BioThrax (anthrax vaccine absorbed); 10,000 doses of anthrax immune globulin; and 65,000 doses of monoclonal antibody (Raxibacumab, formerly Abthrax) for anthrax (US DHHS, 2014).",

This flexibility has been crucial in the recent EVD threat. Without the ability to issue an EUA for a potential public health emergency, one likely would not have been issued for EVD.",

In FY2005, President Bush requested that BioWatch funding be increased to $118 million to expand the program and increase research and the development efforts for improved biosensors. In 2007 Congress cut BioWatch funding by $13 million, which was originally allocated for the purchase of new sensors. In a brief issued by the Nuclear Threat Initiative, the annual estimated cost of maintenance and collection per city is $1 million, with a final program budget estimated at $85 million (Brodsky, 2007). BioWatch is not a stand-alone, autonomous detection system. It requires many hands to pull the pieces together. As previously mentioned, someone has to collect the filter, transport it to a laboratory, extract the sample, process the material, and run the test. All of this labor represents approximately 75% of the operational cost of the program (Cohen, 2007).",

            "text": "The fundamental challenge of the BioWatch system is to detect a biological attack when there is no information about where the event might take place or what meteorological conditions may exist during the event (Shea and Lister, 2003). A critical step in designing the BioWatch monitoring system was deciding where to site the air-sampling collectors. With a limited number of collectors to deploy and a multitude of potential sites, the goal was to maximize the probability that the network will detect the release of a biological agent while also maximizing the protection provided to the people of a given city. To reach this goal, the efficacy of each collector site and its contribution to the entire collector network had to be objectively evaluated using a standard set of metrics. To address this challenging problem, Los Alamos National Laboratory developed a geospatial application to provide analysts with a quantitative, decision-making tool for choosing collector sites. The BioWatch regional sensor siting tool (BioWatch tool) was developed within a commercial, off-the-shelf geographic information system (Linger, 2005).Critical Thinking: Tularemia, BioWatch, and the US CapitolOn September 25, 2005, low levels of F. tularensis (tularemia) were detected on BioWatch filters in and around the Washington, DC area. These positive results came 1 day after a war protest took place on the Capitol Mall. DHS officials first suspected a problem when six sensors used in the BioWatch biological agent surveillance system collected air samples that indicated tularemia might have been present on the Mall. Subsequent testing at the CDC confirmed that there were low levels of tularemia bacteria on the Mall. However, those results were not considered entirely definitive under BioWatch standards; therefore DHS officials did not inform local public health officials in Washington for several days to avoid a public panic. In fact, it was not until September 30 that local health officials and the public were told to watch out for symptoms of the disease, which include chills, fever, headache, muscle aches, and pneumonia. DHS officials announced nearly a week later that the bacteria was naturally occurring and posed no health threat (Francis, 2006).Two questions come to mind when reading this brief. First, why did it take federal government officials so long to notify local government agencies of a potential public health threat? After all, BioWatch is a system that stands for early warning and detection. Second, whenever we look for a problem, we will eventually find it, but we are looking for things that occur naturally. So how do we sort out background levels of these natural pathogenic agents from something that truly poses a threat? The technologies being used to detect these agents merely tell us of their existence; they do not necessarily tell us that they are viable. Diagnostic methods based on an organism\u2019s genetic structure do not yield results equivocal to that sample\u2019s ability to infect a host.\n",

These included a lack of cooperation in regard to the reporting requirements and the lack of follow-through when after-action reports were received (DHS, Office of the Inspector General, 2007). One of the biggest issues with BioWatch has always been the cost of the program. As the program moves into advanced developmental phases, it has the potential to become what it was originally intended to be, an autonomous sampling and detection system. In fact, that has been the goal of the BioWatch Generation 3 (Gen-3) program. An autonomous, stand-alone detector was being sought by DHS\u2014one that would replace the labor-intensive sample collectors that currently exist. Unfortunately, the BioWatch Gen-3 program was canceled (GAO Report, 2014). BioWatch critics in Congress have managed to slow the program and derail advanced development efforts for the time being. However, the technology and commercially available hardware now exists to make the BioWatch program what it was always intended to be\u2014a real-time early warning system for the detection of the most serious biothreat agents that might be released in high-risk areas.

The FBI HMRU fulfills its mission through an integrated effort involving specialized response teams, a national training program, interagency liaison, technical assistance to FBI field and headquarters divisions, and the development of field response programs. The unit also trains, equips, and certifies FBI field office personnel for hazardous materials operations. The FBI HMRU responds to the scene of a credible act of bioterrorism to ensure that the crime scene is processed in accordance with established protocols for safety and evidence processing. This team has extensive experience from the Amerithrax incident and numerous other events that have taken place over the past few years. Formed in June 1996, the FBI HMRU is an example of a vision made reality in a very short time as the nation was preparing for the 1996 Olympics. The unit was envisioned by Dr. Randall Murch, chief of the Scientific Analysis Division of the FBI\u2019s Laboratory Division, and Dr. Drew Richardson, the HMRU director. At the time, the unit\u2019s philosophy was simple: at the site of a WMD incident, there might be scores of dead people about, but if you could not prove who did it, the likelihood of more victims in future incidents increases. Despite the extreme emotion of the moment, evidence has to be collected (Seiple, 1997).",

Specifically, the DoD was mandated by Congress to share its expertise and capabilities for neutralizing, dismantling, and disposing of explosive ordnance as well as radiological, biological, and chemical materials. In addition, the DoD was asked to work toward the development and deployment of countermeasures against WMDs. In May 1998 Presidential Decision Directive 62, Protection Against Unconventional Threats to the Homeland and Americans Overseas, directed that the DoD assist other federal agencies, train first responders, and maintain specially trained military units to assist states with WMD response. Shortly thereafter, the National Guard formed 10 rapid assessment and initial detection units. These teams were designed to provide rapid response to a WMD incident and assist state and local responders. The 10 teams became what is now referred to as WMD Civil Support Teams (CSTs). Since that time, the National Guard has added more teams with the goal of having one for each state. Currently, specific locations for these teams are based on population concentrations and are intended to minimize the response times within particular geographic areas. They were also located to prevent overlapping team areas of responsibility.",

            "text": "Local jurisdictions may request assistance from the CST through their state adjutant general\u2019s office for plans, operations, and military support. Direct request for CST assistance is also available through its operation and command sections. First responders are able to directly contact the CST for possible WMD assistance. Interagency training and cross-training for the CST and first responding agencies become a valuable tool to develop professional relationships (see Fig. 12.10\n). Furthermore, the CSTs are able to respond to all counties within the state or region, including distant island communities, by loading and flying vehicles on US Coast Guard or Air National Guard assets. Response time varies because of remoteness of locations; however, all team members are on 24-h alert at all times (Hurston et al., 2006). It is important to note that CSTs will not take command of the scene of the incident. They are there to augment the local and state assets that arrive on scene with them. They will integrate into the command structure through their own unit commander. Their capabilities, assets, and level of training are impressive.Critical ThinkingImagine that over a 24-h period 17 patients report to the emergency department of a small hospital in a rural community. Clinically, the patients\u2019 symptoms are fever, malaise, flushing, conjunctivitis, myalgia, abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, and a petechial rash. One of the patients is coughing up blood (hemoptysis) and another has seizures in the emergency department and falls into a coma. An infectious disease specialist is called in to determine the cause of this outbreak. The specialist collects blood and urine from most of the patients and orders a battery of tests. Samples are sent on to the hospital laboratory for routine blood and urine tests. A subset of the patient samples is forwarded to a commercial laboratory where more elaborate testing is available. On the basis of initial findings from the hospital laboratory, the specialist comes up with a differential diagnosis of viral hemorrhagic fever, bacterial sepsis, Rocky Mountain spotted fever or other rickettsial disease, leptospirosis, borreliosis, dengue hemorrhagic fever, septicemic plague, or hemorrhagic smallpox.The specialist begins to piece together information gathered from the patients and family members. There appears to be one common event shared by all of the case patients: all attended a major sporting event, a championship college football game that occurred nearly 2 weeks earlier. The physician has a reasonable suspicion that the cases are all related to an intentional act or at least to some bizarre coincidence.\nAt this point, isolates from case patients would be forwarded to a regional laboratory in the state\u2019s capitol city for further testing. If the isolate is found to test positive for one of the CDC bioterrorism agents (Category A, B, or C), an isolate would be sent to the national laboratory in Atlanta for definitive testing. The state bureau of investigation, the FBI, and a local joint terrorism task force would send agents to the community to work with epidemiologists to determine the source of the outbreak. The FBI\u2019s HMRU, along with the state\u2019s Army National Guard\u2019s WMD CST, might be requested to respond to collect and process evidence within the community. The evidence that these teams collect would be delivered to the laboratory via local, state, or federal law enforcement. Environmental and clinical samples would be gathered from numerous sites. The field collection effort would be enormous and likely to include thousands of samples.Review the scenario to discuss implications for local emergency managers and response organizations from the jurisdictions that will be included in the response and investigation. Where does the National Incident Management System, Incident Command System, unified command, and the National Response Framework come into play here? What agency will be in charge of the response? What agency will be in charge of the investigation? Consider something like this occurring in your town.\n",

The task is further complicated by the added dimension that the disaster you may be preparing for will be due to an intentional, covert act that is strategically used in the areas where you are weakest. Such is the insidious nature of bioterrorism and biowarfare. Regardless, we may all find ourselves rather \u201cflat-footed\u201d if and when that moment comes, especially if we are unable to recognize early on that the problem exists. This is all the more dangerous if the agent that emerges is highly transmissible from person to person, the incubation period short, and the case-fatality rate high. A few examples that come to mind are smallpox, pneumonic plague, and pandemic influenza. Our hope is that BioWatch provides us with early detection, which of course depends on where the sensors are placed and what they monitor. Probably one of the best investments we have made along these lines is the establishment of the LRN. Having the ability to quickly and definitively identify the problem is a mainstay of the LRN\u2019s charter.
