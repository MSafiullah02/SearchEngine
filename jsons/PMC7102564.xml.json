Although most human coronavirus infections are mild, the previous epidemics of two betacoronaviruses, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) [[3], [4], [5], [6], [7]] and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) [[8], [9], [10], [11]], have caused more than 10,000 cumulative cases in the past two decades, with mortality rates of 10% for SARS-CoV and 37% for MERS-CoV. The coronaviruses already identified might only be the tip of the iceberg, with potentially more novel and severe zoonotic events to be revealed [1]. Now, the 2019 novel CoV (2019-nCoV) have led to more than 17,400 cases and 362 death till February 2, 2020.",

Its mission is to serve global health by the immediate dissemination of information, which may lead to new preventive measures, prevent the spread of outbreaks, and provide more accurate disease control. Its sources of information include media reports, official reports, online summaries, reports from local observers and others [21]. The reports are reviewed and edited by expert moderators in the field of infectious diseases and are then submitted to the mail server and published on the website and disseminated to subscribers by email. Being a non-profit, non-governmental system, it is free from governmental constraints [[15], [16], [17],21]. In 2014 had 70,000 subscribers in over 185 countries [21], and now (2020) is more 80,000 subscribers, representing almost every country in the world, with ProMED staff, moderators, and team, located across 32 countries and are constantly scanning for, reviewing and posting information related to global health security [22].",

Coronaviruses cause respiratory and intestinal infections in animals and humans. They were not considered to be highly pathogenic to humans until the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002 and 2003 in Guangdong province, China, as the coronaviruses that circulated before that time in humans mostly caused mild infections in immunocompetent people [25]. After that, with MERS-CoV, and now in 2020 with the outbreak of the 2019nCoV, there is an increasing concern on highly pathogenic coronaviruses, such as these, but also other human and animal coronaviruses, should be highlighted. As observed in the results of this study, other human coronaviruses, such as HCoV-229E, -HKU1, -NL63 and -OC43 [25], are poorly reported in posts of ProMED, but also would consequence of weak interest on them, as has been recently evidenced in a bibliometric analysis [26]. The three highly pathogenic viruses (SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV and 2019-nCoV), cause severe respiratory syndrome in humans, and the other four human coronaviruses (HCoV- NL63, HCoV-229E, HCoV- OC43 and HCoV-HKU1) induce only mild upper respiratory diseases in immunocompetent hosts, although some of them can cause severe infections in infants, young children and elderly individuals [25], and in immunocompromised patients.",
