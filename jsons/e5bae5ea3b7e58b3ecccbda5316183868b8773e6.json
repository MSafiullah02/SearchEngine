It was suggested that the immunosuppression predisposing to secondary bacterial infections and subsequent high mortality in field situations in AIV-H9N2 infection could be explained by the atrophy and lymphoid depletion of thymus and probably some other lymphoid organs (Hadipour et al., 2011) .

Research in Veterinary Science 115 (2017) 356-362 Similar virus tracheal shedding titers were detected in the variant IBV infected birds either single or mixed infections with AIV-H9N2, however, in the current study, the classical IBV shedding significantly increased with AIV-H9N2 mixed infection. Elevated virus shedding titers of AIV-H9N2 in presence of IBV infection was previously reported (Monne et al., 2013) . Similarly, in this study, significant increases of AIV-H9N2 virus shedding with classical IBV infection especially at 2 and 5 DPI and with the variant and vaccine IBV strains co-infections up to 7 DPI were observed. However, the only significant elevation of AIV-H9N2 HI antibody titers was recorded with the classical IBV co-infection at 10 DPI. This may be attributed to the earlier and higher replication of both AIV-H9N2 and classical IBV viruses as indicated by higher viruses shedding titers as early as 2 DPI.
