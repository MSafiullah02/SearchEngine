Although RT-PCR is a useful assay, it sometimes provides false-positive results due to contamination. Serological tests, however, do not provide early diagnosis [8]. Since SARS-CoV appears in the blood much earlier than the antibodies [9], the identification of SARS-CoV antigens in sera provides a possible method for early diagnosis. Several studies have found that N protein is highly immunogenic, and antibody response in SARS patients is directed most frequently and predominantly to the nucleocapsid [10], [11]. Based on these findings, we constructed a single chain antibody library to isolate anti-N protein antibodies for early diagnosis and possible therapeutic use.",

After incubation for 1 h at room temperature, plates were washed and the bound antibodies were detected by HRP-conjugated anti-M13 antibody (Amersham Pharmacia, Piscataway, NJ), followed by incubation with the substrate of TMB (3,3\u2032,5,5\u2032-Tetramethylbenzidine).

A similar result was reported in the isolation of scFv antibody against SARS-CoV from a semi-synthesized scFv library [22]. The reason behind our result may be that the isolated scFv antibody N18 has the competitive affinity advantage in the panning and rapidly wiped out others in further stringent pannings. Therefore, fewer rounds of panning would help to get more diverse antibodies. More rounds of stringent panning may help to enrich the high affinity antibodies, but will reduce the diversity at the same time. In the present study, only four rounds of standard panning were performed, but the population was already overwhelmed by N18. It would be advisable to isolate scFv-phages after the second or third round of panning if one is interested in obtaining more diverse antibodies instead of the antibody with the highest affinity.",

The standard genetic mechanism for the VDJ rearrangement in the formation of immunoglobulins was that only one V, one D and one J gene segment join together. Two D segments appearing in one CDR3 is a rare phenomenon. Dr. Baskin reported that D\u2013D fusions in one CDR3 could be observed in all the fetal livers as well as in the adult PBMC, as previously reported [23], [24], [25].

However, some researchers reported that monoclonal antibodies (MAb) to N protein of murine hepatitis virus (MHV, an animal coronavirus) [26] and rotavirus [27] had protective effect on the virus infection even though the antibodies lacking of neutralizing activity. The latter phenomenon may be due to the ability of the IgA antibodies to enter the infected cells by the IgA-transcytosis pathway, thereby interfering with viral transcription [28]. So whether the N18 scFv antibody itself or a modified IgA format by being fused to an IgA Fc fragment has the similar protective effect in vivo needs to be further investigated.",
