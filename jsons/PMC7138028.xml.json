Therefore, by the end of 2008, MDG 4 had been achieved ahead of the 2015 target date, making China the eighth country to achieve MDG 4 worldwide.3 China's accomplishments in reducing under-5 mortality owe credit to rapid socioeconomic development in the country. After reform and the opening up of China's economy, the country's gross domestic product (GDP) increased sharply, from \u00a5365\u00b702 billion in 1987, to \u00a558 801\u00b788 billion in 2013; GDP per person increased from \u00a5382 to \u00a543 320 during the same period.4 As a result of the large-scale actions aimed at alleviation of poverty, the size of poor populations in rural areas of China decreased from 250 million in 1978 to 82\u00b749 million in 2010.5 The implementation of compulsory education projects also brought about growth of net enrolment rate for school-age children from 95\u00b75% to 99\u00b77%.6 These socioeconomic developments laid a good foundation for the improvement of children's health status.",

Specifically, in the new round of health reforms from 2009 to 2012, US$124 billion was earmarked for enhancing China's medical insurance system, establishing and strengthening the health-care service system, and promoting the equalisation of basic public health services including maternal and child health services. In 2003, medical insurance covered only 30% of the national population; at the end of 2012, the coverage rate of medical insurance reached 99% of China's population, and the universal coverage by medical insurance was almost achieved.3\n",

The annual report and child mortality surveillance systems have been established in the 1980s and 1991, respectively, and cover the whole country, which provides abundant information for Wang and colleagues' study. In the discussion of the post-2015 health development agenda, an agreement was reached that the post-2015 development agenda should be established on the basis of the MDGs, and include those unattained MDGs according to the principle of coherence.8 Therefore, the fall in under-5 mortality rates noted in Wang and colleagues' report can serve as a reference for developing countries to set corresponding post-2015 development targets.",

Additionally, 12% of all the counties studied have not yet achieved MDG 4, and are located mainly in the poor areas in west China. Through longstanding efforts, regional differences in maternal mortality in China have been narrowed significantly, and regional equity has been noticeably improved.9 For future studies, attention should be paid to measures targeting the causes of death of children in the poor regions of China. Specifically, the strengthening of human resources for health and improvement of service quality in paediatrics should be given priority.",
