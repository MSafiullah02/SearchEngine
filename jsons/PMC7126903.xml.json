            "text": "\nStreptococcus pneumoniae is the leading cause of bacterial diseases such as sepsis, meningitis and pneumonia. Due to high mortality rate and the global burden of disease, especially in children under 5 and elderly, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) has paid more attention to pneumococcal disease in recent years [1]. The high-cost of antibiotic therapy and increasing resistance of pneumococcus to current antibiotics, suggesting vaccination against S. pneumoniae as the best method for prevention of disease, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) report (https://www.cdc.gov/pneumococcal/about/prevention.html). [2]. The pneumococcal vaccine development is mainly based on surface antigens, including immunogenic proteins and carbohydrates [3]. The 23-valent streptococcus pneumoniae polysaccharide vaccine (PPV) and 7, 10, or 13-valent pneumonia conjugated vaccines (PCV-7, 10, \u221213) are carbohydrate-based vaccines and stimulate serotype-specific immunity [4]. Up to now, the 23-valent pneumoniae polysaccharide vaccine is still applied in elderly and the Pcv-7 as a routine vaccine for children in some countries; however, the vaccine does not cover some serotypes, especially in elderly. PCV10 and PCV13 as the next generation of vaccine could cover more S. pneumoniae serotypes. However, the serotype replacement strategy of pneumococcal infections causes reducing the efficacy of this group of vaccine [5]. Thus, it is necessary to design an efficient novel vaccine. The epitope-based pneumococcal vaccines are the last generation of vaccines that are in the pipeline [2]. In this context, pneumococcal surface protein A (PspA) that is located on the surface of bacteria, and choline binding protein A (CbpA), as the most crucial protective surface antigens, have been introduced as vaccine candidate [6]. Another important vaccine candidate is pneumococcal histidine triad (Pht) protein family, including PhtE and PhtD as the conserved member of Pht expressed in pneumococcal pathogenesis [7]. Other pneumococcal proteins that have shown potential as an efficient vaccine candidate and are needed for full virulence of S. pneumoniae in animal models are pneumococcal iron ABC transporters, including two lipoprotein components, PiuA and PiaA [8]. In general, the majority of epitope-based vaccines can cause induction of cellular or/and humoral immunity as well as offer a safer and more easy-produced alternative for the prevention of diseases; however, the low immunogenicity is the main disadvantage of such types of vaccines. For solving this problem, several methods have been used to enhance the immunogenicity epitopes vaccines, like prescribing the multiple doses of vaccine, adding immunostimulatory agents such an adjuvant to the vaccine [9], and the recent strategy is applying self-assembled peptide motif including beta-sheets or coiled-coil structures in the epitope vaccine [10]. Besides above-mentioned strategies, incorporating universal T-helper epitopes like diphtheria toxoids (DTD) into vaccine can enhance vaccine efficacy. DTD is the most essential components of diphtheria vaccines that are widely used as a universal T-helper [11]. In some cases, the low efficacy of epitope peptide-based vaccines may be according to their fast extracellular degradation, rapid distribution from the injection site and inefficient uptake by antigen-presenting cells (APCs) [12,13]. Several investigations have shown that linking the epitope vaccine to certain carriers (e.g., polymeric or lipidic nanostructures) can develop the efficacy of vaccine via conferring to aforesaid obstacles [[13], [14], [15]]. In this context, designing epitope vaccine bases on self-assembled peptide nanoparticles (SAPN) scaffold, which acts as an antigen-presenting system, is a novel strategy. Moreover, the SAPN vaccines have self-adjuvanticity, without any toxicity; in this regard, it can bypass the low immunogenicity of the epitope peptide vaccine. In this study, CD4 epitopes were selected from PiuA, PhtD antigens, and CD8 epitopes were chosen from PspA, CbpA antigens of S. pneumoniae; moreover, the DTD was determined as universal T-helper compartment. All selected CD4 and CD8 epitopes were inserted between the pentamer and trimer oligomeric domains, which can construct self-assembled structures. Additionally, all segments were fused to each other by the appropriate linkers. The immunoinformatics and structural evaluations of the designed vaccine, showed that it can induce proper immunity against S. pneumoniae; however, experimental immunological tests should confirm the efficacy of our vaccine.",

The PspA and CbpA were applied for selecting cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) epitopes, PhtD and PiuA were used for selectin helper epitopes, moreover DTD was employed as a universal T-helper. Moreover, to generate our self-assembled vaccine the pentamer and trimer oligomeric domains, which respectively form 5-stranded and 3-stranded coiled-coils were added to vaccine construct. In the next step, each part of the vaccine, including CD4+ epitopes CD8+ epitopes, universal T-helper, and the pentamer and trimer oligomeric domains were fused by proper amino acid linkers. According to the order of vaccine parts, four different constructs were built.",

Protein\u2013Sol employs a fast sequence-based method for predicting the solubility of protein based on available data for Escherichia coli protein solubility [17]. The solubility value greater than 0.45 is defined to have a higher solubility than the average soluble E. coli protein. In addition, fold propensity, and net charge for per amino acid can be profiled in calculation along the sequence [18].

In this work, MD simulation was carried out on the monomeric chain and homodimer structure, which chosen by docking process (GalaxyHomomer server). MD simulations were performed for the intended systems using Gromacs 5.0.7 package [39] with Amber99sb-ildn force field [40]. Both systems were solvated in a triclinic box of TIP3P water molecules with a minimal distance of 12 \u00c5 from any edge of the box. Moreover, the concentration of 150 mM of NaCl (physiological conditions) was added to neutralize the systems. The Particle Mesh Ewald (PME) method and the LINCS algorithm were used to calculate long-range electrostatic interactions and constrain all bonds, respectively. The non-bonded cutoff of 10 \u00c5 was used. Firstly, the prepared systems were minimized using the steepest descent algorithm. The first equilibration step was done under NVT ensemble at 300 K during 500 ps. This step was followed by a 3000 ps NPT equilibration run at 1 bar pressure and 300 K temperature. The velocity rescaling with \u03c4\nt = 0.1 ps and Parrinello-Rahman barostat algorithms with \u03c4\np = 0.5 ps were used for the temperature and pressure coupling, respectively. Finally, MD production run was performed for 150 ns under equivalent conditions at 1 bar and 300 K. The time step of 2.0 fs was applied, and the output files were saved every two ps for the further analyses.",

As seen in Fig. 3\na, RMSD plot of backbone atoms of this protein chain shows a significant increase up to 15 ns, but it reaches to steady-state at the rest of simulation time. Since RMSD parameter cannot determine the flexible and rigid regions of a protein chain, Root-mean-square fluctuation (RMSF) values of all residues were assayed as well. All residues in the N- and C-terminal regions show the high fluctuations (Fig. 3b). They have fewer intra-molecular interactions than other residues so that they, and their neighbor residues showed high mobility during MD simulation. Moreover, some residues in the other regions of protein have endured a high fluctuation as well. The majority of these residues are placed in the linker or T-helper regions. The most side chains of these residues have been exposed to solvent molecules, so they have also established a few intra-molecular interactions with other residues over MD simulation time.",

            "text": "According to NIH reports, Streptococcus pneumoniae is still one of the main sources of morbidity and mortality worldwide, especially in children and elderly and categorized into high burden disease [43]. The capsular polysaccharide (CPS) is recognized as an important virulence factor of S. pneumoniae; moreover, based on CPSs the S. pneumoniae is categorized into 95 distinct serotypes. There are ten common serotypes, 4, 6 (6A/6B/6C/6D), 9V/9A, 14, 15F/15A, 15B/15C, 18 (18F/18A/18B/18C), 19F, 19A and 23F, that are the main reason for most pediatric pneumococcal infections worldwide [44]. In the context of antibiotic therapy, common medication to fight bacterial infections, can lead to the emergence of antibiotics resistance S. pneumoniae strains; in this regard, designing the efficient preventive vaccine can be the rational choice [45]. Recently, in some country, child and elderly pneumococcal vaccination have been added to the national immunization program [46]. Now, the PPV and PCV pneumococcal vaccines are available in the market and could prevent individuals from different types of pneumococcal disease, but in some cases, serotype replacement caused the failure of vaccination [47]. Complications and high-cost of PCVs production have caused this vaccine to become unaffordable, especially in developing countries [48]. There are some strategies to overcome serotype replacement phenomena; firstly, the addition of new pneumococcal serotypes e.g. 22F, and 33F to PCV-15, this approch is currently on phase 3 clinical trial [49]. The second approach is employing the whole-cell pneumococcal vaccines; in this method, the attenuated or inactivated pathogen can be used [50]. An appropriate alternative to polysaccharide-based vaccines, is applying pneumococcal protective antigen in vaccine construct. There are several conserved proteins [51] among different S. pneumoniae serotypes, most of them are surface proteins such as PspA, CbpA, and PhtD [52]. In this regard, in our previous immunoinformatic study, the immunodominant epitopes were selected from four antigens, PspA, CbpA, PhtD, and PiuA [53]. Recently, epitope-based vaccines have been introduced as a safer alternative to previous types of vaccines. However, they suffer from some disadvantages such as low immunogenicity. Along with low immunogenicity of peptide vaccines, the variability of immunodominant regions of antigens among different serotypes, is another obstacle in designing efficient peptide-based pneumococcal vaccines [54]. If the suitable conserve epitope was selected, the vaccine would have high population coverage [55]. As mentioned-above low immunogenicity is one of the key drawbacks of epitope-based peptide vaccines; to overcome this issue several approaches are employed. Incorporating universal T-helper epitopes into a vaccine is one of the rational strategies for enhancing immunogenicity. Previous studies recommended that diphtheria toxoids (DTD) contain \"universal\" epitopes for human CD4+ cells (residues 632-651 and 950-969 of tetanus toxoids, and residues 271-290, 321-350, 351-370, 411-430, and 431-450 of DTD); in this context, Okita BM et al., showed The DTD peptides (residues 271-290 and 331-350) are recognized by over than 80% of the toxoid-sensitized subjects [56]. In this regard, the sequences 271-290, and 331-350 were selected as universal T-helper epitopes in our study. The efficacy of nanovaccines were confirmed in different investigations, including influenza nanovaccine [57], chitosan nanoparticle against H1N1 influenza virus [58], and chaitosan-formulated polyepitope vaccine against pulmonary mycobacterial [59]. Another important approach for increasing the immunogenicity of peptide vaccine is the use of self-assembled peptide structures, including alpha helical or beta sheet motifs, which can obtain from natural or de novo structures. Coiled-coil and \u03b2-sheet bio-structural motifs are the most common scaffold for constructing SAPN vaccine.",

In recent years, because of unique characterizations of SAPN, including biodegradability, biocompatibility, size similarity to pathogen [61], self-adjuvanticity, and containing repetitive structure [62], they have been proposed as prominent structure in designing epitope-based peptide vaccine [10,63]. Each SAPN monomer, the subunit that oligomerizes to form the nanoparticle, contains two coiled-coil domains fused together by proper linkers, which are able to oligomerize, and consequently, form nanoparticles. In the context of SAPN formation mechanism, two \u03b1-helical coiled-coil domains, the pentameric coiled-coils that is derived from an N-terminal peptide of cartilage oligomeric matrix protein, and the trimeric coiled-coils that are made through de novo designed C-terminal leucine zipper peptide are linked by two glycine residues to form higher-order nanoparticles; these domains are self-assembled by a combination of hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions existing within the residues of coiled-coil domains [64,65]. In recent years, different SAPN-based vaccines have been designed and evaluated against various pathogens, including Toxoplasma gondii, human immunodeficiency viruses (HIV), Plasmodium falciparum, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus [[66], [67], [68], [69], [70], [71]]. Although Chen et al. study, showed the trivalent antigen combination of YLN (protective peptide epitopes from CbpA) and L460D (fragment of PspA) as epitope vaccine elicited the strong and broad protection in diverse pneumococcal challenge models [72], but there isn't any report on the production of epitope-based SAPN vaccine against S. pneumoniae.",

Besides, a trimmer and pentamer domains were used as the scaffold of SAPN (Fig. 1) and the selected T- and B-cell epitopes were fused to monomer by proper linkers; the applied linkers can enhance proteasome-mediated cleavage, binding to TAP transporter processes, and playing a role as helical linker for increasing the immunogenicity of vaccine construct [[73], [74], [75]].",

The population average of the scaled solubility value (Query Sol) in protein-sol server was 0.45, and any Query Sol greater than 0.45 is predicted as a high soluble protein [76]. Therefore, as shown in Table 2, the selected protein is soluble (Query sol = 0.69), and the result was also confirmed by sol-pro (0.79912). The aliphatic index of protein was 80.72, showed that our protein is thermostable. The instability index of the protein is 25.78, that is less than 40, which shows our protein is stable in the test tube. The GRAVY index of our vaccine is \u22120.537 that presents the protein has an efficient interaction with water. The four different arrangements of vaccine were designed (Table 1), afterwards they modeled and refined by various servers to achieve high-quality models. Among all models, the best model was chosen through validation by Ramachandran Plot, ERRAT, VERIFY 3D, and Prosa-web servers. The high-quality 3D model, was applied for the identification of conformational B-cell epitopes and docking process. According to GalaxyHomomer docking score = 1220.742, the 2-mer subunit is the best number of the subunit for our protein; however, the best model was refined and subjected to MD simulation studies. According to the result of DiscoTope server, the final 3D model of vaccine had 97 conformational B-cell epitope residues (Table 6), which confirmed the vaccine is highly potent in stimulating humoral immunity. The study of secondary structure and exposability of amino acids to solvent demonstrated T and B-cell epitopes regions in final construct are highly exposed to solvent than trimmer and pentamer regions (Fig. 2), which can be concluded the pentamer and trimmer segments are located in the core region of vaccine, and the epitopes parts are located on the surface of oligomer. Additionally, evaluation of the solvent accessible surface (SASA) parameter that measured during MD simulation (Fig. 6) indicates epitope parts have preferred to interact with solvent molecules (hydrophilic part) during 150 ns MD simulation while pentamer, and trimmer parts have inclined to establish hydrophobic interactions during this time. Evaluation of the Rg values during MD simulation indicated decreasing Rg values that mean decreasing the distance of atoms from the center of mass of the protein, so that confirmed the protein chain has been folded during this time. However, superimposition of initial configuration and end of simulation time of MD simulation confirmed the stability of the designed monomeric chain during 150 ns MD simulation time. On the other hand, homodimer structure that was chosen by docking process showed appropriate stability in the course of this time as well. To obtain the best position relative to each other, two protein chains of homodimer structure tried to establish more stable intermolecular interactions and get better configuration during MD simulation time.",
