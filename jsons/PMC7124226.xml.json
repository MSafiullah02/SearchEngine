According to the WHO's report, a total of 8,437 people in 30 countries were affected by the disease, with 831 deaths.2 Taiwan is an island with a total area of 36,000 km2 and a population of 23 million. Because of the close proximity to China and Hong Kong, frequent travel and business contacts resulted in the importation of SARS. From March to July 2003, a total of 150,628 persons were under home quarantine in Taiwan,3 and 3,032 febrile patients were isolated in hospitals.4 Large-scale quarantine, isolation, and body temperature measurement practices had created huge psychological and economic impacts on the society. There were 665 SARS cases reported in Taiwan; about one eighth of the cases were diagnosed at the emergency department (ED) of National Taiwan University Hospital. Soon after the first 2 SARS cases in Taiwan were diagnosed at National Taiwan University Hospital on March 14, 2003,5 the ED was inundated by febrile patients requesting screening for SARS. The situation worsened after April 24, when intrahospital outbreaks occurred in 2 municipal hospitals.6 Because of the proximity of these 2 hospitals to National Taiwan University Hospital, the ED was crowded with patients being screened for SARS in the study period. A total of 875 patients presented to our ED for SARS screening; 754 of them came during the endemic period from April 23 to May 12, or almost 40 cases daily.",

It takes more than 2 days for the chest radiograph to develop infiltrates, and the initial changes are difficult to differentiate from other forms of pneumonia.10 It also takes 8 to 10 days for the reverse transcriptase\u2013polymerase chain reaction to achieve the maximal sensitivity (92.9%).11 The contact or travel history may not be helpful if community outbreak has already taken place. Therefore, early diagnosis of SARS and isolation decisions would be based mainly on clinical presentations. Although the initial presentation of SARS appears nonspecific, we believe that the clinical finding of SARS was unique among the febrile diseases. A scoring system combining symptoms and laboratory results may help in the diagnosis and decisionmaking when the physician is confronted with febrile patients during SARS outbreaks.",
