            "text": "Avian influenza virus (AIV) and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) are respiratory diseases of poultry, caused by type A Orthomyxovirus and Gammacoronavirus, respectively, with several traits in common. They are considered the most economically important respiratory viral diseases, and they threaten the poultry industry worldwide [1]. Mixed infection or co-infection with AIV and IBV has been described as a natural infection in different countries in Asia and the Middle-East [2,3]. More, the IBV vaccine is used extensively in chicken farms in many countries worldwide where both IBV and low pathogenic AIV H9N2 are endemic [3,4]. The H120 strain of IBV was one of the earliest live attenuated IBV vaccines to be developed and has continued to be use in most parts of the world. As with any live-attenuated IBV vaccine, the H120 vaccine strains must replicate in the respiratory tract if they are to stimulate protective immunity. It follows, therefore, that some damage to the epithelial layer of the respiratory tract will occur and a fine balance must be achieved between a strain that is so over-attenuated that it is unable to replicate sufficiently to stimulate immunity and one that is insufficiently attenuated so that serious damage may occur. The H120 virus meets these criteria well and is ideally suited for use in young, susceptible chicks [5].",

They likely compete to infect target cells and replicate. It has been shown that many viruses require the presence of well defined cell surface proteins for cell entry. The cell surface receptor for AIV or IBV on the cell surface is the N-acetyl neuraminic acid (\u03b12,3-sialic acid-galactose) [6]. Such cell receptor also serves as a receptor protein determinant for primary attachment of group 3 corona viruses [7], allowing fusion events and entry of both viruses. Huang et al. have described as it is unknown whether co-infections with AIV and IBV exacerbate clinical signs of the disease in infected birds or produce viral interference, masking infections by either virus [8], even though it is reported that co-infection of IBV with AIV increased not only the severity of AIV-H9N2 clinical sings and gross lesions, but also the mortality rate with extended viral shedding period of AIV [[9], [10], [11]].",

Hatchery vaccination is actually opening the door to a real control of broiler diseases. Indeed, infection of animals with AIV and IBV, following simultaneous, super-infection or vaccination, may lead to severe complications having bad effect on the animal health and the farmer expenses. Mixed infection of poultry with AIV and IBV induced complex clinical picture making identification and diagnosis of either one or both viruses\u2019 difficult [12,22]. Still, questions remain regarding potential interactions between these viruses in co-infected bird [8]. So, it is worthy to better understand the in vivo interactions between these viruses for an efficacious disease control by adapting the vaccination programs (Kelli et al., 2010).",

Chicks inoculated with only IBV or AIV excreted the virus from day 3 to 20dpi, as determined by virus detection in TC and CL swabs (Table 1). In co-infected groups, significant IBV virus excretion was noticed in both TC and CL swabs taken at 11 and 20dpi (p < 0.01).

Chicks infected with IBV then super-infected with AIV-3 days later, showed no IBV shedding either in TC or CL, during the experimental period (Fig. 2, Fig. 3, Fig. 4, Fig. 5).

The results of single AIV infected groups showed classical viral curve with higher virus excretion, in either TC or CL swabs, at 7dpi.

And to study consequences of vaccination on AIV challenge. Infections with more than one virus, such as AIV and IBV, seem to frequently occur in poultry production; but, the effects of such co-infections or vaccination on several host responses such as viral shedding dynamic, antibody seroconversion and clinical signs are not fully known in chicks [15,20]. Besides, reported studies did not specify the various effects of dual viral infection on immune response, virus titers and genes copy number variations and histopathological changes during replication of both viruses. For this, we have deeply evaluated more than one aspects of viral interference between AIV and IBV, as compared to other reported studies [9,20], in terms of body weight, humoral response, macroscopic and microscopic lesions and viral replication using qRT-PCR.",

They are consistent with previous study showing that AIV viral shedding happens mainly by the TC route (Costa-Hurtado, 2014). In addition, virus shedding was lower in all groups simultaneously or sequentially treated, as compared to single infected animals. Previous in vitro or in ovo experiments have shown similar results, in which simultaneous infections with a mixture of AIV and IBV induced inhibition of the replication of both viruses during the first 3 days of infection. In fact, using cell cultures or chicken embryos, co-infections with AIV and (Newcastle disease virus) NDV mixture have shown interference between both viruses, suggesting inhibition of the growth of one virus by the other [[22], [23], [24]]. Such early inhibition may be related to competition for virus receptors on the cell surface, leading to an attachment interference phenomenon. Interference could also be due to intracellular interference related to competition for replication sites or essential factors for viral replication, virus-induced interferon interference or ARN or defective interfering particles [25].",

Identification and assessment of factors affecting viral interference and understanding those that cause delay in virus replication will help finding the path of pathogenicity and transmission of these viruses in chicks. Our results have shown an increase in virus replication in cases of super-infection, which may affect the severity of the disease. Determination of factors that may influence interference during co-infection or favor a delay of one virus growth at the expense of another virus will give new insights on the pathogenesis of these viruses, allowing a better design of diagnostic tools and improved vaccine and vaccination program for better controlling the diseases.",

However, during super-infection, the second inoculated virus has a negative impact on the growth of the first virus inoculated and that the degree of interference depending upon the interval between interfering viruses. The results suggested that interference might interfere during the virus entry into the cells through a competition for shared virus sialic acid receptor that are essential for virus attachment. Interference may also happen when both viruses compete for sites or essential factors of viral replication (Shengqiang et al., 2012). These findings may have a strong influence on prevention and control strategies for the spread of economically important AIV and IBV diseases in the poultry industry. According to our results, vaccine application was safe and do not interfere with AIV H9N2 infection, and does not enhance such infection.",
