There are several issues to consider with these findings, which will be further discussed below: 1) Assessment tools influence prevalence rates, 2) PA guidelines and domains, 3) Girls continue to be less active than boys, 4) Interventions to increase adolescent PA, and 5) The need for scale-up and systems approaches.",

            "text": "It is generally acknowledged that the instrument used for assessing PA will greatly influence the prevalence rates. Guthold et al. 5 based their findings on available self-report data. Despite their known flaws, including potential social desirability bias and cross-cultural, age, or sex differences in reporting, the measures used have been previously validated against objective devices and shown to have acceptable accuracy and reliability at the group level [7] [8] [9] . While device-based data may provide more accurate prevalence estimates, using such tools for surveillance at a global level is currently still not feasible, especially for low income countries that would not have the necessary resources. Furthermore compared to objective devices, self-report data are still better in capturing the different PA domains. Capturing accurate data across different PA domains is important for determining where potential changes in youth PA are occurring and the effectiveness of initiatives and programs at scale. It is therefore important to continue to strive for valid and reliable, harmonized and detailed self-report data (e.g., The Youth Activity Profile (YAP) selfreport tool has been calibrated and cross-validated against accelerometry among youth in the US) 10 . However, it is also important to note that the trends reported by Guthold et al. 5 are based on using the same tool over time, and it is unlikely that different tools will result in substantially lower prevalence rates of insufficient PA.",

As noted above, Guthold et al. 5 defined insufficient PA as youth not engaging in 60 min of MVPA every day or reporting less than 60 min on 5 days per week. The current WHO physical activity guidelines for children and adolescents 4 recommend engagement in at least an hour of PA every day 12 , but there is also some variability in the interpretation of this guideline, especially in studies that use accelerometers. The latter tend to adopt an \"average day\" approach, with guidelines compliance based on participants who engage in at least 60 min of PA on 4 or more days per week 13 . This approach generally results in much lower prevalence rates of insufficient PA. Furthermore it needs to be noted that guidelines requiring an average engagement of 60 min/day across the week, which seems to be best supported by the evidence, may lead to difficulties to capture in population surveys. It is important that population prevalence estimates are based on consistent interpretations of measurable guidelines whenever possible.",

            "text": "Although current PA guidelines do not include activity domains 11 , the PA paradox in adults points out that leisure-time PA has larger health benefits compared to occupational PA 14 . Furthermore Teychenne et al. 15 argue that current adult PA guidelines may not effectively address mental health outcomes and that leisure and transport related PA are most likely to confer mental health benefits. Therefore, Teychenne et al. 15 advise the promotion of enjoyable PA, preferably during leisure time. While this evidence is based on adult datasets, translation towards guidelines for adolescents seems plausible. The WHO recommendation states that for children and young people \"physical activity includes play, games, sports, transportation, recreation, physical education, or planned exercise, in the context of family, school and community activities\". 12 The current report does not, however, take domains or contexts into account. Furthermore, Guthold et al. 5 only included school-going adolescents in their pooled analysis. This may indeed explain why, in contrast with some previous findings, in general the prevalence of insufficient PA was found to be higher in low-income countries (85%) than in high-income countries (79%). Previous reports of higher levels of PA in low-income countries compared to high-income countries, could be primarily related to higher engagement in PA outside physical education, sports and active recreation, such as active domestic chores or work-related PA. Highlighting adolescents' access to a variety of enjoyable types and domains of PA should be considered in future PA guidelines.",

The gender gap is in line with many other studies and has been a point of attention for many years. 16 The widening of the gender gap in the large majority of countries (73%, 107 of 146 countries) is worrying.

Additionally girls should be stronger involved in efforts to create activity friendly environments in which the \"healthy choice is the easy choice\", which is vital for reaching large populations equitably. Neighborhood environmental interventions should foster safe independent mobility which is found to be particularly important for girls. 17 ",

A Realist methodology 18 might be a useful approach for better understanding outcomes of programs and policies in the scope of PA promotion efforts for boys versus girls and for different socioeconomic groups. This methodology moves past the question of \"was it successful?\" to better understand how, for whom, and under what circumstances interventions produce their particular outcomes. Guthold et al. 5 noted that \"investment and leadership, as well as engagement of youth themselves, will be vital to strengthen the opportunities for physical activity in all communities.\" Indeed scientists, aiming at developing youth PA interventions should consider a pragmatic and participatory approach to intervention development and work much more closely and as equal partners with relevant stakeholders. This approach needs to be more systematic than the use of a loose collection of methods, tools, approaches and practices which are collectively labelled as \"participatory\", but which do not have strong theoretical and methodological foundations. Elevating co-creation into a more rigorous and evidence-based methodology is therefore needed. 19",

Indeed it is widely recognized that there is a huge gap between the development of evidence-based interventions for health promotion and their successful and sustainable implementation. Currently, implementation is a very slow process, with the average time lag 7 between scientific discovery and action being 17 years. 20 Furthermore, only a small fraction of evidence-based interventions are actually implemented in practice and policy and, even when implemented, interventions rarely achieve sustainable effects or the predicted effects found under controlled conditions. 21 Clearly implementation science approaches need more attention in order to better promote the systematic uptake of evidence-based programs into routine practice, and, hence, to improve the quality and effectiveness of health promotion efforts. 22 Furthermore, few randomised controlled trials consider the system within which they are conducted. To have the most significant impact on PA at a population level, an understanding of the complex systems that these behaviors are embedded within is necessary. 23 The implementation and scale-up of effective evidence-based PA programs require identification of key stakeholders across multiple levels of the system, and identifying and working through key barriers to implementation. 22 In sum, the findings of Guthold et al. 5 are alarming and we support their call for action. Consistent interpretations of guidelines, considering PA domains and the inclusion of data from adolescents no longer attending school are important for future surveillance. Using systematically developed realist and co-creation methodologies to better understand and develop multisectoral strategies and programs and efforts to promote effective uptake of evidence-based programs into routine practice at scale are urgently needed.",

Given the concerns 8 about the increasing spread of the Corona virus and maybe other viruses in the future, efforts are needed to support maintaining regular PA and routinely exercising in a safe home environment and further study is needed to inform decision makers on benefits and harms of safety measures and on protecting the right to walk, run and cycle outdoors safely for those who are not symptomatic.",
