In Japan, PRRS virus (PRRSV) was first isolated from fattening pigs and stillborn pigs in 1993 (Shimizu et al., 1994) . The antigenicity of the Japanese isolates was more closely related to that of the American-type virus than to that of the European-type virus . PRRSV is thought to be a major primary pathogen and increase severity of secondary infections related to porcine respiratory disease complex. Concurrent infection with PRRSV and porcine respiratory coronavirus or swine influenza virus (Van Reeth et al., 1996) , Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae (Thacker et al., 1999) or Streptococcus suis (Galina et al., 1994) causes more severe disease than PRRSV alone. Pseudorabies virus (PRV) infection caused nervous disorders, mortality and respiratory disease in pigs. Dual infection with PRV plus bacteria induced severe pneumonia in pigs (Fuentes and Pijoan, 1987; Iglesias et al., 1992a; Sakano et al., 1993; Shibata et al., 1998) . In swine farms, pigs are confronted with several infectious agents, especially after weaning, and infections of Japanese pigs with PRRSV and PRV are common shortly after the grouping of pigs in intensive fattening units. Combined infections with both viruses likely take place at that stage, but the clinical effects of dual infection with PRRSV and PRV have not been demonstrated. The objective of this study was to compare the clinical and pathological effects of dual infection with these viruses in young pigs, with that of a single infection with PRRSV or PRV.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 249, "end": 271, "text": "(Shimizu et al., 1994)", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 653, "end": 677, "text": "(Van Reeth et al., 1996)", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 705, "end": 727, "text": "(Thacker et al., 1999)", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 750, "end": 771, "text": "(Galina et al., 1994)", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 992, "end": 1018, "text": "(Fuentes and Pijoan, 1987;", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1019, "end": 1042, "text": "Iglesias et al., 1992a;", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1043, "end": 1063, "text": "Sakano et al., 1993;", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1064, "end": 1085, "text": "Shibata et al., 1998)", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "The E4 strain of PRRSV (Shibata et al., 2000) was used for pig inoculation at the fourth passage level in swine alveolar macrophages (SAM).

A reduction of weight gain was seen in PRRSV-PRV group; however, this difference was not statistically significant between PRRSV-PRV and control group probably because of limited size and individual variation. In the PRRSV-PRV group, the duration of the fever was significantly prolonged, and lung lesion was increased, compared with either the PRRSV or PRV group. The lungs failed to collapse and were mottled or diffusely tan and red. Gross lung lesion was not observed in the other groups. The PRRSV titres of tonsil and lung in the PRRSV-PRV group were significantly higher than that in the PRRSV group on day 21. In summary, infection of the pigs with PRRSV followed by PRV challenge resulted in increased clinical signs and pneumonia lesions, as compared to the pigs infected with PRRSV or PRV only. Under experimental condition, respiratory clinical signs in pigs experimentally infected with PRRSV alone were not observed and pulmonary gross lesions have usually been very mild (Carvalho et al., 1997; Solano et al., 1997) . Infection with the E4 strain or other Japanese isolates alone did not cause pigs to develop respiratory clinical signs and visible pneumonia as reported in previous studies (Hirose et al., 1995) . Generally, in field conditions, pigs coinfected with PRRSV and other organisms show clinical symptoms. Infection by the American PRRSV strain, ATCC VR-2385, induced gross lesions characterized by lungs that were mottled tan or diffusely tan, were firmer and heavier than normal lungs, and failed to collapse (Thacker et al., 1999) . The VR-2385 strain was classified as a high virulence strain (Halbur et al., 1996) , and should be more virulent than the strain used in the present study. The lung lesions observed in the PRRSV-PRV group were similar to that introduced by the VR-2385 strain. On the other hand, some PRV strains induce pulmonary lesions in addition to lesions in the central nervous system, and cause mild respiratory disease to develop in pigs. However, the Yamagata S-81 strain used in the present study introduced no pneumonic lesions in pigs inoculated intranasally (Shibata et al., 1998) . In the present study, gross lung lesions were also not observed in the PRV group. Generally, characteristic lung lesions induced by PRRSV infections is proliferative interstitial pneumonia, and that by PRV infection consist of necrotic bronchitis, bronchiolitis, and alveolitis (Kluge et al., 1999) . The prominent lung lesion in the PRRSV-PRV group was proliferative interstitial pneumonia. Furthermore, PRRSV was isolated from the lungs of the inoculated pigs; however, PRV was not isolated from the lungs in any group on day 21. These findings support the hypothesis that the lung lesions observed in the PRRSV-PRV group may be induced by PRRSV infection.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1109, "end": 1132, "text": "(Carvalho et al., 1997;", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1133, "end": 1153, "text": "Solano et al., 1997)", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1329, "end": 1350, "text": "(Hirose et al., 1995)", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1661, "end": 1683, "text": "(Thacker et al., 1999)", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 1747, "end": 1768, "text": "(Halbur et al., 1996)", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 2240, "end": 2262, "text": "(Shibata et al., 1998)", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 2543, "end": 2563, "text": "(Kluge et al., 1999)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Further studies using a larger number of pigs would be necessary to confirm this hypothesis.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Recently, it has been reported that coinfection with PCV2 and PRRSV induces more sever lesions and clinical disease than that with PCV 2 or PRRSV alone (Allan et al., 2000; Harms et al., 2001; Rovira et al., 2002) .
