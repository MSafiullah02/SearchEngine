For example, in the province of Guangdong, which is the leading destination for non-local migrants, children of non-local migrant workers already represented 67 % of all students who were receiving compulsory education in 2008. Since the number of non-local migrant workers is still growing, the demand for education services for all children with non-local hukous is quickly exceeding what public elementary and middle schools can supply. By paying qualified private schools for admitting children with non-local hukous, the Guangzhou municipal government, for example, is trying to increase the percentage of children with non-local hukous who receive education in this city; some members of the CPPCC Guangdong Provincial Committee have proposed issuing \u201ceducation vouchers\u201d to let children with non-local hukous.4\n",

These social security systems exhibit the drive towards socialization, compliance, wide coverage and multiple dimensions of basic urban social security provision in China.9 In addition, a social security system for non-local migrant workers is being put in place. Nationwide, in addition to work insurance, the percentages of employers that bought insurance for their employees, or migrant workers who bought insurance for themselves, was increasing more rapidly in 2011 than in 2009 (see Table 10.2). In 2012, the numbers of migrant workers covered by urban basic medical and work-injury insurance increased by 3.55 and 3.45 million people respectively, compared to 2011.10 Regional social security systems have also been established in east, central and west China. The percentages of migrant workers covered by both work-injury and medical insurance, in particular, are higher than those of migrant workers covered by other insurances, due to the nature of their jobs. Also, from a sectoral perspective, the percentages of non-local migrant workers covered by relevant insurance in such sectors as manufacturing, wholesale/retail, transport/warehousing/postal service and residential services are higher than in others such as the building industry (see Table 10.3).\n\n",

It also required municipal governments to expand the provision of public services to migrant workers. The Notice of the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security and the Ministry of Finance on Issues Regarding Further Improving the Public Employment Service System issued in 2013 makes clear that the basic principle of public employment services is to provide basic public employment services in a sustainable and equitable manner across China by merging urban and rural labor markets and creating a long-term service mechanism that is geared to both urban and rural areas and that serves, in effect, all workers.",

Governments, companies, workers and training organizations should work together to promote vocational education and skills training for migrant workers, enabling them to get better jobs and higher incomes. Secondly, relevant authorities should support employment by providing employment information. It is necessary to gradually establish a rural labor force registration system, to realize information sharing among regional public employment service organizations, and to enhance government guidance services, including the provision of public employment information, for the employment and migration of rural people. Thirdly and lastly, it is necessary to ensure a steady wage increase. Local governments should: continue to improve the minimum wage standard system to guide companies in properly increasing wages; allow trade unions to play a positive role in protecting workers\u2019 rights; establish a negotiation mechanism between employers and employees, and facilitate the creation of well-regulated labor relations; increase efforts in law enforcement and in monitoring employers\u2019 contractual signatures and observation of contractual obligations; increase workplace safety management, occupational health management and worker protection; and, finally, encourage NGOs to provide migrant workers with legal assistance.",

            "text": "Firstly, given migrant workers\u2019 varying needs for housing, relevant authorities may encourage employers to build subsidized housing such as corporate dormitories for these workers. Local governments should firstly expand access to the local public rental housing assistance system to include migrant workers who have steady jobs and who have lived in their host cities for a required number of years, before gradually serving more people, including migrants, and providing access to more types of affordable housing. It is advisable to develop a well-regulated housing rental market in urban areas to satisfy migrant workers\u2019 need for rented accommodation. Secondly, relevant authorities could provide migrant workers with housing allowances and set up specific urban public housing funds as part of the housing assistance system; they could also think about the possibility of expanding the coverage of the urban Housing Provident Fund (HPF) system to migrant workers who have steady jobs in cities, and could implement more flexible policies. When it comes to tax policies, relevant authorities should grant certain tax incentives to individuals or organizations that build dormitories for migrant workers and/or provide housing rental services; they should also grant such tax incentives to migrant workers who are able to buy affordable and price-controlled housing. Thirdly and lastly, relevant authorities should establish appropriate financial and land supply systems which would favor the building of affordable housing for migrant workers, thereby gradually including these people in the urban affordable housing system available to all workers.",
