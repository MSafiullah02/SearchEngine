We performed a pilot study in 19 patients exploring the feasibility of intensified cytarabine in patients with CML [4], as cytarabine may exert a dose\u2013response effect in myeloid leukemias [5, 6]. This schedule of intensified cytarabine combined with idarubicin proved feasible in these patients, while an encouraging major cytogenetic response rate of 60% was observed. In contrast to acute myeloid leukemia (AML), intensive chemotherapy has received relatively little attention in CML so far, as the potential morbidity and mortality was considered a major hurdle.",

Patients without an HLA-matched sibling donor were randomized between two groups. Randomization was stratified by center, by age (\u226460 vs >60 years) and Sokal risk score (< 0.8 vs 0.8\u20131.2 vs >1.2). The high-dose arm A consisted of two courses of intensified cytarabine based chemotherapy. The first cycle consisted of cytarabine 200 mg/m2 (days 1\u20137) combined with idarubicin 12 mg/m2 (days 1 and 2). The second course consisted of high-dose cytarabine 3 g/m2 \u00d7 2 (days 1, 3, 5, and 7). The dose of cytarabine was reduced to 1 g/m2 in patients above 60 years of age. The low-dose cytarabine was given to patients assigned to arm B of the study. They received IFN-\u03b1 3\u20139 \u00d7 106 Units (U) daily in combination with cytarabine 20 mg/m2 s.c., days 1\u201310, administered every 4 weeks. If the WBC reached a nadir of 1 \u00d7 109/l or the platelet count was below 50 \u00d7 109/l, the dose of cytarabine was reduced to 15 mg/m2 for 10 days in the subsequent cycles. A similar dose adaptation was performed if the WBC and platelet count had not recovered to, respectively, 3 and 100 \u00d7 109/l, within 5 weeks after start of cytarabine. Combination therapy was given for 1 year, but could be prolonged for a maximum of 2 years in patients achieving cytogenetic response. Cytarabine was discontinued in case of a complete cytogenetic response documented twice at least 3 months apart. Both therapies were followed by IFN-\u03b1 maintenance therapy until disease progression or intolerance. Maintenance treatment with IFN-\u03b1 was started at a dose of 3 \u00d7 106 U daily. After 1 week, the dose was increased to 4.5\u20136 \u00d7 106 U daily. Thereafter, the highest tolerable dosage was given, aiming at a dose of 4.5\u20139 \u00d7 106 U daily. In case of common toxicity criteria (CTC), grade 3 (severe), or grade 4 (life threatening) toxicity, therapy was interrupted and resumed at a lower dose after recovery of toxicity. In case of hematological toxicity, therapy was temporarily withheld if the WBC was below 2 \u00d7 109/l or the platelet count dropped below 25 \u00d7 109/l. When the platelet count measured between 25 and 50 \u00d7 109/l, the dose was reduced with 50%. The concurrent administration of hydroxyurea was allowed only when the WBC exceeded 10 \u00d7 109/l despite adequate IFN-\u03b1 treatment or above 5 \u00d7 109/l in the presence of CTC grade 3\u20134 toxicity, in patients not receiving low-dose cytarabine.",

The criteria for a complete hematological response were normalization of the WBC (< 10 \u00d7 109/l) with no immature forms, a platelet count (< 450 \u00d7 109/l) and disappearance of clinical signs and symptoms (including splenomegaly) and for failure a WBC > 20 \u00d7 109/l.

Secondary endpoints were OS, hematological, and cytogenetic response between the two treatment arms, as well as side effects and infections of the different treatment regimens. Patient characteristics were compared between patient groups with the Pearson\u2019s \u03c7\n2 test in case of discrete variables, or the Kruskal\u2013Wallis test in case of continuous variables. Hematological and cytogenetic response rates were compared using Pearson\u2019s \u03c7\n2 test or Fisher\u2019s exact test, whichever appropriate. Event-free survival and OS were estimated by the actuarial Kaplan\u2013Meier method, and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. Kaplan\u2013Meier curves were constructed to illustrate survival, and compared between patient groups using the log-rank test. Side effects and infections were scored according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) and summarized using descriptive statistics. All reported P-values are two-sided, and a significance level \u03b1 = 0.05 was used.",

In addition, as previous studies evaluating more intensive chemotherapy showed relatively high rates of cytogenetic relapse, we added IFN-\u03b1 maintenance after two courses of chemotherapy to prevent relapse. While the cytogenetic response rate proved superior in the intensified arm (P = 0.02), the majority of patients lost their initial cytogenetic response emphasizing that IFN-\u03b1 maintenance proved to be insufficient to preserve the initial cytogenetic response.

            "text": "The lack of a sustained beneficial effect of intensified cytarabine followed by IFN-\u03b1 maintenance may be explained in several ways. Cytarabine acts almost exclusively on proliferating cells. Apart from a large pool of proliferating malignant mature and more immature myeloid cells, CML is also characterized by the presence of quiescent noncycling Ph+ progenitors [11\u201314], which may not have been affected sufficiently by cytarabine. As earlier shown by Holyoake et al. [12], these progenitors may have a proliferative advantage over their quiescent normal counterparts and may, hereby, be responsible for gradually resuming malignant hematopoiesis after recovery from cytarabine induced cytopenia. Interferon-alfa maintenance did not prevent the regrowth of malignant hematopoiesis in most patients with an initial cytogenetic response. In view of the relatively low rates of complete cytogenetic responses to IFN-\u03b1 [3, 15], also IFN-\u03b1 may have been unable to eliminate malignant progenitor cells that were responsible for the recapitulation of malignant hematopoiesis in our patients. The relatively low dose of IFN-\u03b1 administered after intensified cytarabine may have contributed to that effect. However, reports in literature do not support a dose response effect for IFN-\u03b1. A metaanalysis of three prospective controlled trials comparing low-dose and high-dose IFN-\u03b1 showed no benefit for high-dose therapy [16].",

[9] treated 32 patients with intensive chemotherapy consisting of daunorubicin, cytarabine, vincristine, and prednisone followed by IFN-\u03b1 maintenance. Overall, 60% of patients showed a major cytogenetic response, but only eight patients (25%) had a sustained cytogenetic response. No survival benefit was observed compared with a matched historical control group. Improved survival by intensive chemotherapy was suggested by Giles et al. [10] in patients who did not benefit from IFN-\u03b1. The projected 10-year survival was 50% for the study group vs 35% for patients who received an IFN-\u03b1 based regimen at the MD Anderson. Alternatively, chemotherapy may be further intensified and supported by autologous transplantation. McGlave et al. [17] summarized results of eight transplant centers. One hundred and forty-two patients in first chronic phase received an autologous transplantation. The 3-year survival was approximately 60% with some indication of a plateau after 3.6 years in the survival curve. Simonsson et al. [18] reported the Swedish results with autologous transplantation. Initial treatment included hydroxyurea and IFN-\u03b1 and one to three courses of intensive chemotherapy. The actuarial 6-year survival from diagnosis of all 160 registered patients was 68%, including 30 patients having received an autograft and 59 patients who were allografted. The survival of 581 patients retrieved from the EBMT registry who received an autologous transplantation between 1983 and 1998 were reported by Olavarria et al. [19]. The median survival was 8 years from SCT without indication of a plateau in survival curve. Patients with a major cytogenetic response 1\u20132 years post SCT and also patients who received IFN-\u03b1 post SCT did significantly better. Although none of these studies show definite proof of a survival advantage with intensive therapy, a subgroup of yet to be defined patients could potentially benefit from more intensive chemotherapy.",

            "text": "Is there still a role for chemotherapy in the current imatinib era? In the IRIS trial, the estimated rate of major cytogenetic response and complete cytogenetic response rates were 87 and 76% in the imatinib group, respectively, compared with 35 and 15% in the group given IFN-\u03b1 plus cytarabine at 18 months [20]. Less then 5% of patients achieved a complete molecular response. In patients with a major molecular response within 12 months, estimated progression-free survival at 24 months was 100% compared with 95% for patients in complete cytogenetic response without a 3 log reduction of BCR-ABL and 85% for patients who did not have a complete cytogenetic remission [21]. As a result, the current goal of treatment in first chronic phase CML patients is to aim for a major molecular response [21, 22]. Resistance, however, is a major concern. Different mechanisms of resistance against imatinib have been reported, including, mutations of the BCR-ABL kinase domain, gene amplification or overexpression of BCR-ABL, clonal evolution, overexpression of the multidrug resistance P-glycoprotein, and inactivation by \u03b1-1 acid glycoprotein [23\u201327]. Currently, combination therapies are being developed to prevent resistance or to treat patients that have acquired resistance [28]. Apart from the combination of imatinib with alternative signal transduction inhibitors, also the combination with conventional chemotherapy is being explored. With respect to the combination of imatinib and cytarabine, two groups have reported initial results. The French CML group performed a phase II trial in 30 patients [29]. A complete cytogenetic response was obtained in 70% of the patients at 12 months. We performed a phase I/II study exploring the feasibility and efficacy of escalating doses of imatinib and two different dosages of cytarabine [30]. The probability of reaching a complete cytogenetic response was 67%, a major molecular response was 51%, and a complete molecular response was 28% at 18 months of treatment. While these initial molecular results seem promising, longer follow-up is needed to evaluate whether cytarabine significantly adds to the efficacy of imatinib and may prevent resistance.",
