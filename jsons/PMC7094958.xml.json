            "text": "Since the discovery of RIG-I, much research has been done to unravel the molecular and structural requirements for RIG-I activation by immunostimulatory RNAs. Collectively, this work shows that RIG-I monitors the 5\u2032 ends of RNA molecules for several biochemical features, a process involving both the CTD and helicase domain (Fig. 2c). The first breakthrough was the finding that RNA molecules bearing a triphosphate (PPP) group at their 5\u2032 end activate RIG-I29,30. This observation was subsequently extended to include additional properties of RNA 5\u2032 ends that determine RIG-I activation. First, base pairing of the 5\u2032-PPP-containing RNA molecule to a complementary strand of RNA is required for RIG-I activation, with the most potent RNA agonists forming a blunt end31,32. Second, RNAs with uncapped diphosphate (PP) groups at the 5\u2032 end activate RIG-I, much like RNAs with 5\u2032-PPP moieties33. Third, the 5\u2032-terminal nucleotide needs to be unmethylated at its 2\u2032-O position to allow RNA recognition by RIG-I34. These functional data are nicely underpinned by structural studies of RIG-I. The CTD has a pocket binding specifically to 5\u2032-PPP or 5\u2032-PP groups and also contacts the unmethylated 2\u2032-O group of the first nucleotide20,35\u201337. The base-paired portion of the RNA forms contacts with the helicase domain in RIG-I18,19,21. The helicase domain has ATPase activity, and ATP hydrolysis determines the dissociation rate of RIG-I from RNA37\u201340. Stable RIG-I\u2013RNA interaction displaces the CARDs, which in the inactive RIG-I conformation interact with parts of the helicase domain18. As a consequence, the CARDs from multiple RIG-I proteins oligomerize and become accessible for interaction with MAVS, resulting in downstream signalling (reviewed elsewhere41).",

For example, cellular mRNAs acquire a cap structure involving 2\u2032-O-methylation (that is, cap 1 or cap 2) in the cell nucleus following transcription, before export to the cytoplasm. Similarly, 28S and 18S ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) and tRNAs are processed in the cell nucleus and their mature, cytosolic forms typically only have a single phosphate at the 5\u2032 end. The 5S rRNA retains a 5\u2032-PPP moiety but is methylated and extensively complexed with proteins. Therefore, such RNAs do not activate RIG-I; in fact, 5\u2032-monophosphate RNAs have recently been suggested to block RIG-I42.",

            "text": "In contrast to cytosolic cellular RNAs, several viral RNAs have features characteristic of RIG-I agonists. The genomes of many negative-sense RNA viruses contain partially self-complementary 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends, which base pair to form duplex structures called \u2018pan-handles\u201931. In addition, such viral RNAs often have an unmethylated 5\u2032 end that bears a PPP group, derived from the ribonucleoside triphosphate used by viral polymerases during initiation of genome replication. Probably the best studied example of this is influenza A virus (IAV), and work by several groups has shown that RIG-I detects IAV genomes in infected cells43\u201346. More recently, small aberrant viral RNAs produced by the IAV polymerase were shown to also activate RIG-I; these RNAs \u2014 much like full-length genomes \u2014 have a 5\u2032-PPP group and form a duplex structure47. In addition to negative-sense RNA viruses, infections with some positive-sense RNA viruses are also detected by RIG-I. For example, these infections include dengue and Zika viruses of the Flaviviridae family, and involve recognition of nascent viral genomes containing 5\u2032-PPP groups prior to capping48,49. Activation of RIG-I by viral RNAs not containing the typical features of RIG-I agonists has also been proposed; for example, a uridine-rich stretch in the hepatitis C virus (HCV) RNA genome located at a distance from the 5\u2032 end was shown to activate RIG-I50. It is noteworthy that the presence of a 5\u2032-PPP group on viral RNAs not only makes these \u2018visible\u2019 to RIG-I but also allows restriction factors, including IFIT family proteins, to target these RNAs (reviewed elsewhere51).",

In the case of lytic KSHV infection, vault RNAs (vtRNAs) were highly enriched in RIG-I precipitates53. vtRNAs are conserved and participate in the formation of cytoplasmic ribonucleoprotein particles called vaults57. vtRNAs are highly self-complementary, are transcribed in the cell nucleus and have a 5\u2032-PPP group from the initiating ribonucleotide. However, dual specificity phosphatase 11 (DUSP11) usually removes two phosphates from the 5\u2032 end of vtRNAs, creating 5\u2032-monophosphate ends58. Lytic KSHV infection results in reduced levels of DUSP11 and in the accumulation of 5\u2032-PPP-bearing vtRNAs that then activate RIG-I53. Interestingly, DUSP11 levels are not affected during latent infection53. Given that RIG-I activation prevents lytic KSHV infection53, it is possible that a pathway involving DUSP11, vtRNAs, RIG-I and type I interferons determines the balance between lytic and latent infection. It is noteworthy that HIV-1 may also downregulate DUSP11 by means of the viral Vpr protein59. Concomitantly, non-coding cellular Y-RNAs were found to accumulate in their 5\u2032-PPP-containing form and to bind to RIG-I in HIV-1-infected cells59. Moreover, endogenous RNAs lacking the canonical features of RIG-I agonists, including RNAs cleaved by RNase L60 and microRNAs (miRNAs)61, have been suggested to activate RIG-I in virus-infected cells. Finally, endogenous retroviral elements were shown to activate RIG-I via de-SUMOylation of the host transcriptional repressor tripartite motif-containing 28 (TRIM28; also known as KAP1)62.",

Infection with many different types of virus, including RNA viruses and DNA viruses, results in the triggering of MDA5 signalling. MDA5 is essential for type I interferon induction during infection with picornaviruses16,17, a family of positive-sense RNA viruses. For many other viruses, MDA5 appears either partially redundant with other sensors of infection or acts in a temporally distinct manner63. In many instances, infection with viruses that activate MDA5 results in the accumulation of dsRNA in the infected cell, which has been proposed to activate MDA5. However, studies analysing RNAs bound by MDA5 in infected cells reported that MDA5 interacts predominantly with one RNA strand of viral RNA64,65. Additionally, surrogate LGP2 immunoprecipitation identified encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) L-region antisense RNA as an MDA5 ligand66. Future work, perhaps using iCLIP (individual-nucleotide resolution ultraviolet crosslinking and immunoprecipitation) and other techniques to identify MDA5-associated RNAs, will be required to understand whether virus infection generates a specific \u2018RNA molecular pattern\u2019 for MDA5 recognition, as seen for RIG-I.",

Activating mutations in the genes encoding RIG-I and MDA5 (DDX58 and IFIH1, respectively) have been identified in some patients with Singleton\u2013Merten syndrome or Aicardi\u2013Gouti\u00e8res syndrome67\u201370. Some of these mutations may change the conformation of RLRs in such a way that spontaneous signalling to MAVS occurs in an RNA-independent manner69,71. Furthermore, RLR mutations may result in aberrant detection of normal cellular RNAs38,39,70,72. For example, long hairpin RNAs derived from inverted repeat Alu elements have been suggested to activate mutant forms of MDA5 found in Aicardi\u2013Gouti\u00e8res syndrome72. In addition to RLR mutations in rare diseases, IFIH1\nsingle-nucleotide polymorphisms have been associated with many common, inflammatory diseases, including type 1 diabetes mellitus73\u201379. These IFIH1 single-nucleotide polymorphisms are likely to induce heightened type I interferon levels, but whether this involves constitutive activation or increased responses to infections remains to be determined.",

            "text": "Much progress has been made over the past few years connecting changes in RNA metabolism to RLR activation. For example, mislocalization of mitochondrial RNA (mtRNA) into the cytosol leads to MDA5 activation80. This occurs when the function of SUV3 and PNPase, mitochondrial enzymes involved in the degradation of mtRNA, is compromised and results in chronic type I interferon production, including in patients with mutations in the gene encoding PNPase80. The mechanism by which mtRNA escapes the mitochondria and gains access to the cytosol in this setting remains to be determined. In addition to mislocalization of cellular RNAs, defects in A-to-I RNA editing result in activation of MDA5. Indeed, adenosine deaminase acting on RNA 1 (ADAR1) deficiency in humans and mice causes chronic type I interferon production and inflammatory pathology81,82. These effects require MDA5, suggesting that editing of endogenous RNAs by ADAR1 prevents engagement of MDA5 (refs83\u201385). Unedited duplex RNAs derived from inverted repeat Alu elements have been proposed to be a major MDA5 stimulus in ADAR1-deficient cells72. Interestingly, some types of tumour are dependent on ADAR1: loss of ADAR1 in transformed cells can sensitize to immunogenic cell death, which involves MDA5-driven type I interferon production and protein kinase R (PKR)-mediated effects on cell viability86\u201388. Finally, in contrast to the cell-autonomous scenarios discussed above, RLR activation by endogenous RNAs can also occur in a cell non-autonomous manner. In a breast cancer model, the tumour microenvironment results in increased production of the non-coding, 5\u2032-PPP-containing RN7SL1 RNA in stromal cells, followed by transfer of this RNA via exosomes to cancer cells, resulting in RIG-I activation89. Of note, in this specific setting, RIG-I activation and type I interferon induction were shown to promote cancer progression89.",

Biochemical and functional studies have established that K63-linked ubiquitylation of RIG-I at the CARDs is important for MAVS binding and antiviral cytokine responses90. Structural analysis showed that K63-linked polyubiquitin stabilizes the RIG-I CARDs in a signalling-active, oligomeric, \u2018lock-washer\u2019 conformation in which the ubiquitin chains are bound along the outer rim of the 2CARD tetramer. Both covalently attached and unanchored (meaning, non-covalently bound) K63-linked ubiquitin chains contribute to effective RIG-I oligomerization and signal transduction91,92. TRIM25, from the tripartite motif (TRIM) protein family (Box 3), has been shown to mediate RIG-I CARD K63-linked ubiquitylation, and studies in cells in which TRIM25 was silenced or knocked out showed impaired cytokine responses to diverse stimuli (for example, infection with Sendai virus, IAV or human papillomavirus 16, or transfection with poly(I:C) or RNA from HCV)90,93\u201397. Given the important role of TRIM25 in RIG-I-mediated antiviral gene induction, several viral pathogens have evolved antagonists that directly inhibit TRIM25 activity, including NS1 from IAV96,98, NS1 from respiratory syncytial virus99, E6 from human papilloma virus97 and the BPLF1 protein from Epstein\u2013Barr virus100, or the subgenomic RNA of dengue virus101 (reviewed in detail elsewhere102,103). Moreover, in recent years several cellular proteins (for example, nuclear dbf2-related 2 (NDR2), zinc finger CCHC-type-containing 3 (ZCCHC3), NLR family pyrin domain-containing 12 (NLRP12) and caspase 12) that specifically regulate TRIM25\u2019s function in RIG-I K63-linked ubiquitylation have been identified (as described below). Structural studies revealed the molecular details of RIG-I signalosome assembly through a mechanism of TRIM25 dimerization104,105.",

            "text": "Given that K63-linked ubiquitylation is a key activation step in RIG-I signalling, it is not surprising that partial redundancy exists. Besides TRIM25, Riplet (also known as REUL or RNF135) has been shown to mediate RIG-I K63-linked ubiquitylation, thereby facilitating RIG-I signal transduction106. Of note, although several studies showed that Riplet modifies the CTD of RIG-I and thereby acts cooperatively with TRIM25 (refs106\u2013108), other studies suggested that Riplet can also modify the RIG-I CARDs109,110. Interestingly, Riplet has recently been implicated in an IRF3-mediated antiviral innate response that is independent of the RIG-I\u2013MAVS signalling pathway111, which raises the question of whether the effect of Riplet deficiency on antiviral cytokine induction is primarily due to Riplet\u2019s role in RIG-I activation or its independent signalling function downstream of it. Finally, the ubiquitin ligases TRIM4 and Mex-3 RNA binding family member C (MEX3C) also reportedly promote RIG-I signal activation through K63-linked polyubiquitylation of multiple residues in the CARDs112, and thus a model of sequential and hierarchical RIG-I CARD ubiquitylation has been proposed113. Conversely, RIG-I stability is regulated by classical degradative K48-linked polyubiquitylation mediated by at least three E3 ligases \u2014 Cbl, ring finger protein 122 (RNF122) and RNF125 \u2014 whereas ubiquitylation mediated by linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex (LUBAC) negatively affects the stability of TRIM25 and its interaction with RIG-I114\u2013117 (Fig. 3). Ubiquitylation events are reversible processes, and, accordingly, several deubiquitylating enzymes, in particular ubiquitin specific peptidase 3 (USP3), USP21 and CYLD lysine 63 deubiquitinase (CYLD), modulate RIG-I signalling by removing K63-polyubiquitin chains, although with unique kinetics (reviewed elsewhere112,118). On the other hand, USP4 and USP15 enhance the stability of RIG-I and TRIM25, respectively, by proteolytically cleaving K48-linked ubiquitylation from these molecules119,120.",

The zinc-finger protein ZCCHC3 has recently been shown to function as a co-receptor for both RIG-I and MDA5 (ref.94). Co-immunoprecipitation and cell fractionation experiments showed that ZCCHC3 binds with its C-terminal zinc finger domains to RNAs that activate RLRs (including 5\u2032-PPP RNA and high molecular weight poly(I:C)), whereas its N-terminal domain interacts with the helicase and CTD of RIG-I and MDA5. This interaction mode enhanced RNA binding by RLRs, as well as the K63-linked ubiquitylation of RLRs by TRIM25, which was also found to be in complex with ZCCHC3 (of note, Riplet, TRIM4 and TRIM65 were not found to be associated with ZCCHC3). Functional studies in ZCCHC3-deficient cells and mice demonstrated that ZCCHC3 was required for efficient RLR-mediated cytokine responses to several RNA viruses. Of note, the phenotype of ZCCHC3 knockout was comparable with that of TRIM25 gene editing using CRISPR, which also markedly reduced Sendai virus-triggered cytokine responses94. Moreover, several DExD/H-box helicases may regulate RLR signalling (Fig. 4). For example, DEAH-box helicase 15 (DHX15) was shown to bind dsRNA and to facilitate the ability of RIG-I to hydrolyse ATP and to signal downstream138. In accord, cells depleted of DHX15 were more susceptible to infection by RNA viruses from several families, including paramyxoviruses and rhabdoviruses. DExD/H-box helicase 60 (DDX60) has been suggested to promote RIG-I-dependent (and potentially also MDA5-dependent) antiviral interferon and ISG induction, although conflicting results have been reported in DDX60-knockout cells and mice139\u2013141. Riplet, which is one of the E3 ligases mediating RIG-I K63-linked ubiquitylation, was recently shown to promote RIG-I signalling in a ubiquitylation-independent manner. It was suggested that by forming a dimer and by crossbridging RIG-I filaments on longer RNA molecules, Riplet induces higher-assembly aggregates of RIG-I110.",

            "text": "Recently, several regulatory proteins for TRIM25 have been identified and functionally characterized. The kinase NDR2 (also known as serine/threonine-protein kinase 38-like (STK38L)) was shown to be crucial for TRIM25-mediated and RIG-I-mediated antiviral interferon responses, evidenced by the impairment of antiviral cytokine induction when NDR2 was gene-edited in cells (in particular, macrophages) and in mice. Interestingly, the kinase activity of NDR2 was shown to be dispensable for its positive effect on RIG-I signalling. Using cell-based assays and in vitro experiments with recombinant RIG-I and TRIM25 proteins, this study showed that NDR2, through interaction with both RIG-I and TRIM25, stabilized their complex formation and promoted TRIM25-induced K63-linked ubiquitylation of the RIG-I CARDs142. Ting and colleagues recently unveiled a novel regulatory mechanism that interconnects the RLR and NOD-like receptor (NLR) pathways. The pyrin-containing NLR member, NLRP12, which is expressed predominantly in dendritic cells and neutrophils, was shown to dampen cytokine responses by RIG-I following RNA virus infection or 5\u2032-PPP RNA stimulation, evidenced by higher innate immune signalling in NLRP12-deficient bone marrow-derived dendritic cells. This study further showed that, under normal conditions, NLRP12 interacts with TRIM25, blocking its ability to ubiquitylate and activate RIG-I. At the same time, NLRP12 enhanced the K48-linked ubiquitylation of RIG-I by RNF125, thereby destabilizing RIG-I. During the course of viral infection, however, NLRP12 protein abundance is gradually reduced, relieving the TRIM25-inhibitory mechanism and, at the same time, stabilizing RIG-I143. Caspase 12, a negative regulator of inflammasome signalling, was shown to be required for type I interferon induction in response to West Nile virus infection in vitro and in vivo by interacting with RIG-I and regulating its K63-linked ubiquitylation by TRIM25 (ref.144). In addition to these TRIM25-regulatory proteins, several cellular RNAs have been discovered to bind to TRIM25 and regulate its E3 ligase activity (as described below). RIG-I reportedly can also be activated in a K63-linked polyubiquitin-independent manner by oligoadenylate synthetase-like (OASL), which is a unique member of the OAS family in that it is devoid of 2\u2032\u20135\u2032 oligoadenylate synthetase activity and possesses two UBL domains. It has been proposed that upon transcriptional induction of OASL and its binding to RIG-I, the UBL domains of OASL mimic the presence of K63-polyubiquitin chains, leading to RIG-I signalling145.",

Inversely, miR-485 targets the RIG-I mRNA for degradation, thereby dampening the antiviral type I interferon response151. miRNAs also regulate the expression of RLR-regulatory enzymes. miR-526a downregulates the expression of the deubiquitylating enzyme CYLD, which ultimately promotes RIG-I K63-linked ubiquitylation and interferon responses152. miR-15b negatively regulates gene expression of the E3 ligase RNF125, thereby controlling RIG-I protein stability during Japanese encephalitis virus infection153. Using an RIG-I affinity purification\u2013RNA immunoprecipitation approach combined with ultraviolet crosslinking, Cao and colleagues identified that, in murine macrophages, several lncRNAs were enriched with RIG-I following VSV infection154. Individual silencing of RIG-I-bound lncRNAs showed that lnc-Lsm3b, when depleted, increased IFN\u03b2 production upon infection with RNA viruses (for example, Sendai virus and VSV), but not the DNA virus HSV-1. Furthermore, lnc-Lsm3b was transcriptionally upregulated during the course of RNA virus infection, suggesting that lnc-Lsm3b could function as a negative-feedback regulator of RIG-I signalling, maintaining immune homeostasis. Indeed, lnc-Lsmb3-deficient mice challenged with VSV produced higher amounts of type I interferons and, correlated to this, showed reduced viral burden and disease symptoms compared with infected control mice. Biochemical characterization showed that lnc-Lsm3b interacts with the CTD of RIG-I, competing with RNA agonists for RIG-I binding. Furthermore, lnc-Lsm3b stabilized the intramolecular bond between the N-terminal CARDs and the central helicase domain, maintaining RIG-I in an autorepressed, monomeric state. By contrast, lnc-Lsmb3 deficiency promoted the interaction of RIG-I with TRIM25, TRIM25-induced K63-linked ubiquitylation and, consequently, RIG-I oligomerization following VSV infection (Fig. 4). It is important to note that lnc-Lsm3b is specific to mice; as such, exploring human lncRNAs that act as feedback inhibitors, similarly to lnc-Lsm3b, will be an exciting new avenue of research.",

Functional RNA interference screening showed that lnc-ATV promoted the replication of several RNA viruses, specifically HCV, Zika virus, Newcastle disease virus and Sendai virus, hinting at the possibility that lnc-ATV promotes an antiviral host pathway commonly triggered by these viruses. Functional studies indicated that lnc-ATV suppresses the RIG-I-mediated antiviral response as knockdown of lnc-ATV promoted TBK1-dependent and IRF3-dependent interferon responses to RNA virus infection. lnc-ATV was shown to bind to RIG-I, although more detailed studies are needed to define the precise mechanism by which lnc-ATV inhibits RIG-I activity.",

Biochemical and functional studies showed that the ability of TRIM25 to bind RNA is important for its E3 ligase activity and, thus, its positive effect on RIG-I antiviral signalling148. However, which type (or types) of host or viral RNAs are bound by TRIM25 in physiological contexts, such as virus infection, has remained unknown until recently. Lin et al. identified that a previously uncharacterized lncRNA, called Lnczc3h7a, directly binds to TRIM25, stabilizing the interaction of the E3 ligase with RIG-I, which ultimately promotes RIG-I signalling156. Silencing or gene-editing of Lnczc3h7a significantly decreased interferon and ISG expression in peritoneal macrophages infected with viruses that predominantly trigger RIG-I (VSV and Sendai virus). However, silencing of Lnczc3h7a had no effect on pro-inflammatory responses to non-RIG-I stimuli (for example, EMCV or lipopolysaccharide (LPS)). Lnczc3h7a is transcriptionally induced by interferon stimulation or viral infection, and gene expression profiling showed that Lnczc3h7a is expressed in many immune cell types. Lncxc3h7a-knockout mice showed defective cytokine responses, enhanced virus replication and more severe pathology following VSV infection compared with control mice156. Through the iCLIP assay, the authors showed that Lnczc3h7a not only interacts with TRIM25 but also, through a short RNA stem\u2013loop structure, with the helicase domain of RIG-I, suggesting that Lnczc3h7a acts as a molecular scaffold to enhance RIG-I\u2013TRIM25 complex formation; this promoted TRIM25-mediated K63-linked ubiquitylation of RIG-I and, ultimately, its ability to form signalling-active oligomers early during infection. With regard to MDA5 activation, lnc-ITPRIP-1 was shown to interact with the sensor, stabilizing its binding to viral RNAs and promoting its oligomeric signalling-competent form157. Finally, besides the described lncRNAs and miRNAs that directly regulate RLR activities, others act downstream of RLRs or broadly regulate inflammatory gene or ISG expression158\u2013160.",

In most cases, an absence of autophagy promotes the RLR-mediated cytokine responses, indicating that autophagy has a dampening effect on RLR signalling. The LRR-containing protein leucine rich repeat-containing 25 (LRRC25) recognizes RIG-I \u2018earmarked\u2019 with ISG15, inducing its degradation by p62-mediated selective autophagy162.

NLR family member X1 (NLRX1) together with its binding partner, the mitochondrial Tu translation elongation factor (TUFM), dually regulates virus-induced type I interferon induction and autophagy164. Complex formation of NLRX1, TUFM, ATG5\u2013ATG12 and ATG16L1 negatively controlled RIG-I\u2013MAVS binding during infection while, at the same time, promoting virus-induced autophagy164,165. Furthermore, in autophagy-defective cells, RLR signalling has been found to be more effective owing to overzealous production of ROS due to the accumulation of dysfunctional mitochondria161. Interestingly, RLR activation also induces autophagy166,167, showing an intricate relationship between these two host pathways that, on the one hand, could aid in terminating cytokine responses, while, at the same time, promoting direct virus restriction by autophagy.",

            "text": "Significant progress has been made in dissecting the mechanisms that lead to RLR activation and, equally importantly, on what keeps RLRs controlled in uninfected conditions. Although much has been learned about the molecular features of viral RNAs that induce RIG-I activation, significantly less is known concerning the circumstances in which host-derived RNAs activate RLRs and the mechanistic basis of this. Recent work highlighted the importance of mislocalized, misprocessed or unmasked cellular RNAs (mostly non-coding RNAs) in RLR-driven autoimmunity or antiviral responses, which is expected to stimulate future studies to determine the physiological relevance of such RNAs in disease contexts. In particular, the recognition of DNA virus infection by RLRs via sensing of non-coding RNAs is an emerging theme. It will be important to test whether this concept applies not only to herpesviruses but generally to DNA viruses and to other virus classes detected by RLRs (Table 1). The recent advance in the characterization of RLR-mediated immune sensing of nucleic acid ligands can now be utilized for the development of novel RLR agonist or antagonist-based therapies for autoimmunity, infectious diseases or cancer. With regard to the regulatory mechanisms of RLR function by various enzymes, it remains to be determined how these regulators themselves are activated during viral infection and what their cell type-specific and species-specific roles are. Moreover, the role of miRNAs and lncRNAs in RLR signal modulation has just begun to be elucidated, and future work may further expand the repertoire of non-coding RNAs implicated in the RLR regulatory circuit, which will be critical information for potential therapeutic purposes.",

This results in the triggering of an intracellular signalling cascade that transcriptionally induces the genes encoding type I interferons, which are subsequently secreted. Type I interferons act in an autocrine (not shown) and paracrine manner by binding to their receptor, interferon-\u03b1/\u03b2 receptor (IFNAR), which activates the Janus kinases (JAKs). These in turn activate the transcription factors signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) and STAT2, leading to expression of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs). Several ISGs have direct antiviral effects. Type I interferons and ISGs also play important roles in bacterial infections and cancer; these effects can be both beneficial and detrimental, depending on the setting. Finally, production of type I interferons and ISGs over extended periods of time can lead to autoinflammatory and autoimmune diseases.",

An additional RNA-binding fold, called the carboxy-terminal domain (CTD), is also found in all RLRs.

RIG-I and MDA5 are activated by immunostimulatory RNA, for example, viral RNAs. They then undergo conformational changes that expose and multimerize their CARDs (not shown for simplicity), which allows homotypic CARD\u2013CARD interactions with MAVS. MAVS is anchored with its TM into mitochondria, mitochondrial-associated membranes (MAMs) and peroxisomes, and relays the signal to TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and I\u03baB kinase-\u03b5 (IKK\u03b5).
