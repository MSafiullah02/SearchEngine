Crucially, the fangcang obviated most of the risk of within-household transmission, which frequently occurs as viral loads can be high for mild infections. 8 Home-based isolation, which is reliant on personal",

Test kit shortages and limited health-care facility capacity have also led to unconfirmed cases self-isolating at home.",

Although cities within Europe and the USA might not be able to create make-shift isolation centres similar to those in Wuhan, due to a lack of social acceptability or negative public perceptions, other strategies should be considered to reduce transmission, such as repurposing hotels or dormitories.
