Patients with malignancies and ARDS have received less attention. Outcomes were studied in a huge cohort of more than 1,000 patients with mainly haematological malignancies and infection-induced ARDS [1] . The most important point was that survival improved over time. The authors outlined the fact that non-invasive ventilation was used in 30 % of the patients but failed in 70 % of these. An important point corroborating epidemiological studies done in other categories of patients with acute respiratory failure was that non-invasive ventilation failure was associated with a worse outcome.",

Prone position exerts various beneficial effects regarding the ventilation-perfusion relationship. In a detailed review Guerin et al. [4] described the proposed beneficial mechanisms in ARDS patients, making the point that prevention of ventilator-induced lung injury and improvement in haemodynamics likely contribute. There are several hypotheses to explain the discrepancies observed in the literature such as the enrolment of mild or moderate ARDS patients in some trials. In a meta-analysis [5] the authors stratified seven trials on prone positioning in ARDS on the basis of high or low tidal volumes. Prone positioning was associated with a significant decrease in the relative risk of death only in studies using low baseline tidal volume (B8 ml/kg PBW). This meta-analysis suggested that tidal volume is a potential confounding factor in interpreting the results of prone position trials in ARDS.",

In an ancillary study of the PROSEVA trial [6] , it was shown that the rate of pressure ulcers was higher in the patients who were positioned prone vs. controls, in particular those ulcers involving the face and the anterior part of the thorax. The use of prone positioning, male gender, higher age, body mass index and SAPS II score at admission were all independently associated with the risk of developing a pressure ulcer. This study clearly suggested that the use of prone positioning should be done according to well-defined medical and nursing protocols in each ICU using this technique.",

A rapid increase in central venous pressure while right ventricular systolic volume does not increase suggests that right ventricular failure is present. Lung-protective strategies aimed at decreasing lung overdistension favourably impact right ventricle performance. Under these circumstances right ventricular dysfunction remains associated with a worse outcome. Inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) may reduce right ventricular afterload, but the use of iNO remains controversial in ARDS patients. Despite being effective in improving oxygenation in some patients, all trials have concluded that iNO does not improve the outcome of ARDS patients, and impaired renal function may be a side effect. However, as stressed in a review [8] , there is the need to evaluate the use of iNO during lung-protective ventilation as a rescue therapy prior to ECMO when mechanical ventilation and prone positioning have failed to improve gas exchange.",

[17] performed an individual patient data meta-analysis of seven studies (2,184 patients) to assess the associations between tidal volume size, duration of mechanical ventilation and need of sedation in patients without ARDS. Patients were assigned to three groups based on tidal volume size (B6, 6-10 and C10 ml/ kg PBW). The number of patients breathing without assistance by day 28 was higher in the group ventilated with tidal volume B6 ml/kg PBW as compared to those ventilated with tidal volume C10 ml/kg PBW (93 vs. 89 %; p = 0.03). Only two studies (187 patients) could be included in the meta-analysis of need of sedation. There were no differences in number of days patients received sedatives, opioids or neuromuscular blocking agents, or in the total dose of any of these drugs. The results suggest that use of lower tidal volumes in patients without ARDS at the onset of mechanical ventilation could be associated with shorter duration of ventilation. Use of lower tidal volumes seems not to affect sedation or analgesia needs, but this need to be confirmed in a robust well-powered RCT.",

The rates of acute respiratory events (primary endpoint) or acute respiratory failure were not different between the NIV and control group. Rescue NIV was used less in the NIV group, but re-intubation rates were not different between the groups. Mortality rates were low in both groups. This paper was accompanied by an editorial [23] , which gave some possible explanations for the lack of beneficial effects. In the postoperative period, it is sometimes difficult to clearly separate ''preventive'' and ''curative'' application of NIV. Probably some of the patients received NIV for ''grey zone'' indications (at the time of starting NIV and also after) which may be considered as an intermediary state between ''preventive'' and ''curative'' application of NIV [23] . Further studies are needed to better identify the patients who may benefit from NIV after thoracic surgery and the optimal NIV protocol (duration, settings, interfaces and humidification systems use for gas conditioning).",

This international RCT included 247 patients, 128 of whom were allocated to a heat and moisture exchanger (HME) group and 119 to a heated humidifier (HH) group. There was no significant difference in the intubation rates (the primary endpoint) between the HH and HME groups (37 vs. 30 %, respectively, p = 0.28). No significant difference was observed for NIV duration, ICU and hospital LOS or ICU mortality. In addition, no difference in the patients' mucosal dryness was reported with HH in comparison with HME. These results suggest that despite a strong physiologic rationale supporting the use of HH during NIV [25] , this method cannot be recommended as a firstline treatment in all patients with ARF. The use of an HME (ideally with a low dead space) while removing the additional dead space (flex-tubing) seems to be acceptable in light of the results of this study. Finally, contrary to recommendations published in 2012 that propose HH for NIV rather than HME, the authors found no difference in outcomes. However, in the presence of persistent high PaCO 2 levels associated with threatening encephalopathy, the reduction of dead space with an HH may be considered. This paper was accompanied by an editorial [26] which asked the question why a trial that finished enrolling patients in December 2003 would be published 10 years later. The authors of this editorial [26] emphasized that every reasonable attempt should still be made to publish the data.",

At the beginning of the 1990s, there was little evidence regarding the best method of withdrawing patients from mechanical ventilation. Today, withdrawal from mechanical ventilation (or weaning) is one of the most common procedures in ICU. Esteban et al. [29] published one of the seminal papers on weaning in which they reported that the best method for withdrawal from mechanical ventilation in difficult-to-wean patients was a once-daily spontaneous breathing trial with a T-piece. Following this study [29, 30] , several other studies [31] have shaped weaning as an evidence-based technique. The results of these studies [29, 32] have been applied progressively to clinical practice. Currently, the withdrawal from mechanical ventilation could be summarized as the performance of a spontaneous breathing trial to evaluate extubation readiness (this trial could be performed with a T-piece, which occurs most commonly, or with CPAP or low levels of pressure support). Most patients could be disconnected after passing the first spontaneous breathing trial. In patients who failed the first attempt at withdrawal, the use of a once-daily spontaneous breathing trial or a gradual reduction in pressure support is the preferred weaning method. However, new applications of the standard techniques, such as NIV, or new methods of mechanical ventilation, such as automatic tube compensation, automated closed-loop systems and automated knowledge-based weaning systems could play a role in the management of the patients with difficult or prolonged weaning. In the future, studies should better evaluate the relationship between the implementation of protocols for the optimization of sedation and weaning outcomes. Moreover, the focus should be on the relationship between ICU-acquired weakness and weaning failure. An early mobilization of patients could be proposed for the prevention or early therapy of ICU-acquired weakness associated with mechanical ventilation weaning-sedation protocols.",

Mechanically ventilated patients qualified the sensation of dyspnoea as ''moderate to intense'' and it could even reach unbearable levels necessitating the administration of analgesics according to some studies. Dyspnoea was also associated with anxiety and delayed psychological sequelae such as recollections of ICU experiences and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), all important deleterious consequences; consequently, we must keep in mind that dyspnoea can often simply be improved by altering ventilator settings.

On behalf of the Interdisciplinary Advisory Board of the Improving Palliative Care in the ICU (IPAL-ICU) project, Puntillo et al.

Evidence-based methods to assess pain are the enlarged 0-10 numeric rating scales (NRS) for ICU patients able to self-report and the critical care pain observation tool or Behaviour Pain Scale for patients who cannot report symptoms verbally or non-verbally. These validated scales and the relationship between pain, anxiety and fear were further explored in a ''What's new in intensive care'' article by G\u00e9linas et al. [50] . The Respiratory Distress Observation Scale is the only known behavioural scale for assessment of dyspnoea, and thirst is evaluated by patient self-reporting using a 0-10 NRS. Optimally titrated opioids remain the mainstay for pain management while dyspnoea should be treated by optimizing the underlying etiological condition, patient positioning and sometimes supplemental oxygen. Finally several oral interventions are recommended by Puntillo et al. [49] to alleviate thirst. The authors insist that the quality of care should be monitored in order to improve the assessment and management of these important symptoms.",

They compared the family satisfaction with care and quality of dying as assessed by the family and the ICU nurses, as well as quality of palliative care assessed from the medical record. Admission from the hospital ward was associated with lower family ratings of quality of dying and satisfaction than admission from the ED. Interestingly, nurses did not report differences in quality of dying. In addition, patients admitted to the ICU from hospital wards were less likely to have family conferences or discussion of prognosis in the first 72 h after ICU admission, but were more likely to have life support withdrawn. The authors conclude that admission from the hospital ward is associated with family perceptions of lower quality of dying and less satisfaction with ICU care.

Mortality increased from 24 % at hospital discharge to 41 % at 1 year. Patients who died after discharge were older and more likely to have been discharged to a nursing home, another hospital or hospice as compared to those who survived to 1 year. Important predictors of mortality were age, comorbidities such as HIV, metastatic and nonmetastatic cancer, hematologic malignancy and chronic kidney disease present at the time of admission and not living at home prior to admission. The authors concluded that 1-year mortality is essentially affected by nonmodifiable factors and that therefore these factors should be taken into account when testing new interventions in ARDS and improving guidance in the offering of full resuscitation for high-risk patients and in the discussions of prognosis with the relatives.",

If families may be unaware of the potential benefits of donation, these benefits should be described. The authors argued that if family members offer inconsequential or inaccurate reasons to forego organ donation, they should be persuaded of the problems or inaccuracies of such reasons. Furthermore, they also argue that family members should be informed that many families who refuse consent for organ donation ultimately come to regret that decision. Others have suggested that families' decisions regarding donation should not be challenged as they are distressed over the loss of a loved one, but the authors argued that to compound their difficulty with decisionmaking by withholding key information is to disrespect the family and patient.",

They described the persistence of significant fatigue-defined as an effort-induced decrease in muscle contractility that recovers after rest-at 24 h after induction in healthy volunteers. This landmark observation became the tenet of the once-daily, T-tube trial arm in RCTs for ventilator weaning in the ICU and helped to inform the design of a trial of weaning for tracheostomy patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventilation. Further, this work elucidated low-frequency fatigue and the introduction of twitch airway pressure to document the prevalence and outcome of respiratory muscle weakness.

They reported average yearly decreases of 7 % in the riskadjusted mortality rates for both overall medical admissions and among haematological patients, in parallel with an increase in the proportion of admissions of haematological patients over time. This contemporary study also reinforced that leukopenia was not associated with worse outcomes in these patients.",

Incidence of events occurring during ICU stay is typically calculated as the incidence proportion (number of events/number of patients) or as incidence rate (number of incident events/patients days). The latter may be preferred because it accounts for the patient-time at risk. However, this automatically implies that one has to consider also the risks of observing competing events during ICU stay. For instance ICU infections may not be observed as a result of prior discharge from the unit. Similarly, death secondary to infection or any other life-threatening event may not be observed during ICU stay because of discharge from the unit. In order not to present incomplete or misleading results the authors recommend that investigators should always calculate and report the incidence rates of such competing events.",

Along this line, scepticism is needed whenever research accomplishments are too good to be true.

In most EU countries, prior consent by a legal representative is used as a substitute for informed patient consent for non-urgent medical research. Deferred consent by the patient or surrogate decision-maker is accepted as a substitute in acute emergency research in approximately half of the EU countries. In 12 countries, emergency research is not covered in national law. A proposal for a regulation by the European Commission was recently examined by the European Parliament and the Council with the goal of replacing Directive 2001/20/EC. In this proposal deferred patient and/or proxy consent is allowed, but it does not support emergency research. For example, in this proposal deferred consent is only possible when legal representatives are not available. This proposal will delay inclusion of patients in acute life-threatening conditions in short time frames. As the proposal would be binding in all member states, emergency research in acute situations would be impaired by this proposal. Kompanje et al. reviewed this proposal and some alternatives that would better support clinical research in emergency situations.",
