In contrast to GPV, the complete genomic sequence data of MDPV isolates are still limited and their phylogenetic relationships largely remain unknown. In this study, the entire genome of a pathogenic MDPV strain ZW, which was isolated from a deceased Muscovy duckling in 2006 in China, was cloned, sequenced, and compared with that of other classical MDPV and GPV strains. Results: The genome of strain ZW comprises of 5071 nucleotides; this genome was shorter than that of the pathogenic MDPV strain YY (5075 nt). All the four deleted nucleotides produced in strain ZW are located at the base-pairing positions in the palindromic stem of inverted terminal repeats (ITR) without influencing the formation of a hairpin structure. Recombination analysis revealed that strain ZW originated from genetic recombination between the classical MDPV and GPV strain. The YY strain of MDPV acts as the major parent, whereas the virulent strains YZ99-6 and B and the vaccine strain SYG61v of GPV act as the minor parents in varying degrees. Two recombination sites were detected in strain ZW, with the small recombination site surrounding the P9 promoter, and the large recombination site situated in the middle of the VP3 gene. The SYG61V strain is a vaccine strain used for preventing goose parvoviral disease. This strain was found to be solely involved in the recombination event detected in the P9 promoter region. Phylogenetic analyses between strain ZW and other classical strains of MDPV and GPV were performed. The results supported the in silico recombination analysis conclusion. Conclusions: MDPV Strain ZW is a novel recombinant parvovirus, and the bulk of its genome originates from the classical MDPV strain. Two virulent strains and a vaccine strain of GPV were involved in the recombination process in varying degrees.",

The mortality rate of the disease ranges from 10% to 80% depending on age [2] [3] [4] [5] .

The viral genomes are approximately 5.1-kb single-stranded DNA with equal polarities encapsidated in the viral capsids [10] . Their genomes are flanked by identical inverted terminal repeats (ITR), which consist of 456 nucleotides for MDPV, and 442 nucleotides for GPV [11, 12] . The outside portion of ITR can fold on itself to form a palindromic hairpin structure. The inside portion of ITR, also designated as the D sequence, reversely complements with the D\u2032 sequence in the 3\u2032 ITR, allowing the entire genomic molecule to form a larger range of palindromic structure [13] . ITR contains a terminal resolving site (TRS), Rep protein binding site (RBS), and other transcription factor binding sites, which are required for genome replication, transcription, packaging, and rescue from cloning vector [10, 14, 15] .",

However, usage of the combined vaccine also provides the chance for genetic recombination. In the present recombination analysis, we found that SYG61v not only participated in the recombination event in the P9 promoter region but was also involved in the recombination events that occurred in the VP3 gene. Remarkably, the DNA sequence in strain ZW surrounding the P9 promoter region was wholly replaced with the sequence from strain SYG61v. Considering that strain ZW itself is highly pathogenic to Muscovy ducklings, the biological purpose underlying this recombination event involving a vaccine strain remains to be investigated.",

As the major structural protein, the VP3 protein harbors most of the antigenic epitopes distributed on the surface of the viral capsid [10] . In this study, the VP3 gene of strain ZW incorporated approximately 1.1-kb foreign nucleotide sequence from GPV, which ultimately shaped the distinctive antigenicity of strain ZW, different from the classical strains of MDPV and GPV. In addition to the recombination events, several amino acid point mutations were also found to occur in the VP1 protein of strain ZW, all of which are specific for strain ZW and are different from those of the classical MDPV or GPV strains. Point mutations at amino acid positions 450, 485, 493, 548, and 585 were in the recombination region of the VP3 protein, whereas point mutations at positions 79 and 712 were outside of the recombination region. Therefore, the recombination and point mutations contributed to rapid evolution and increased fitness, respectively, and collectively promoted the emergence of the recombinant MDPV strain ZW.",

These transcription factor binding sites are densely distributed in the 200-bp stem of the palindromic structure of ITR. Although these deleted nucleotides were at the base-pairing positions and did not influence the hairpin structure formation for the remaining nucleotides, the nucleotide deletions shortened the spacing distance between adjacent transcription factors. Whether the nucleotide deletions that occurred in ITR have potential influence on the transcription efficiency and contribute to virulence of strain ZW remain to be further investigated.",

If the PCR templates of the characterized recombinants per se were contaminated with genetic materials from multiple strains, plus degeneration of the designed primers used in PCR amplification, an inauthentic genomic sequence information will probably be generated, which would result in false conclusions in the subsequent recombination analysis. In view of this, we conducted the direct genome cloning strategy by strain ZW by restriction endonuclease digestion. Therefore, the possibility that the genomic sequence of strain ZW has been contaminated with other isolates has been excluded. Fig. 6 Antigenic comparison between the recombinant strain ZW and the classical GPV and MDPV strains by agar gel precipitation (AGP) tests. A monoclonal antibody (mAb) against GPV was used in the AGP tests. A 1:20 dilution of this mAb was further diluted by two-fold series in phosphate buffered saline (pH 7.4) and placed in the outer wells surrounding the central well containing antigen. The classical GPV strain LH (a), the recombinant strain ZW (b), and the classical MDPV strain YY (c) were used as the AGP antigens, respectively For the first time, we presented a detailed description of the genomic characteristics of the novel MDPV strain ZW and confirmed the occurrence of recombination events between GPV and MDPV. Continuous molecular epidemiological investigation should be deployed to assess the incidence of strain ZW-like recombinant viral infection in the field. In view of the widespread usage of live vaccines in the Muscovy duck flocks, direct genome cloning and sequencing against the MDPV isolates is a more reliable method than PCR amplification for acquiring accurate sequence data for recombination analysis. However, whether the traditional bi-combined vaccine currently in use can still provide robust protection for Muscovy ducklings against infection from emerging recombinant MDPV in China remains to be evaluated and clarified.",

The attenuated vaccine strain SYG61v acted as the only minor parent, thereby contributing to the recombination event that occurred in the P9 promoter region.
