The increasing trend of population growth (United Nations, 2017),the intensification of industrialization and depletion of resources, the inefficient utilization of nutrients for food and feed production, all in the context of the observed and projected climate changes, will expectedly accentuate the impacts on the environment. Furthermore, the decline of available irrigation water and arable land, along with rising global temperatures that destabilize farming systems, possess a threat for feed and food security (Godfray et al., 2010; Vermeulen et al., 2012; Wheeler and von Braun, 2013). All these pressures make the searching for alternative ways for producing feed and food, unavoidable.",

It is expected that protein consumption will increase, resulting in a higher demand for protein rich feed. In the EU most vegetable feed for animal consumption is based on soybean (35\u201340% proteins) which, given that its growth requirements are met most easily in sub- and tropical climates and require large land areas, is imported from third countries mainly Brazil and USA. However, the sustainability of soybean production on lands converted from forest or pasture use (Arima et al., 2011; Fehlenberg et al., 2017) and of its long-distance importation is questionable, making the long-term stability of any locally or globally feasible food-security programme dependent on finding alternative ways of producing protein-rich biomass for feed or food production (Taelman et al., 2015). Although improvements in crop yields through improved cultivation and production practices can be projected (Balafoutis et al., 2017; Vermeulen et al., 2012), alternative feed and food production systems must be considered for true food security (Rumpold and Schl\u00fcter, 2013; Walsh et al., 2015).",

Besides proteins, they also contain fatty acids, pigments, anti-oxidants etc., that are a very interesting source to be used as food and feed supplements (Christaki et al., 2011; Leng, 1999; Markou and Nerantzis, 2013; Pulz and Gross, 2004). Some microalgal species, such as Arthrospira (Spirulina), Chlorella, and Dunaliella are rich in proteins (>50%dw), display good productivities (20\u201330 tDM ha\u22121 year\u22121 (Walsh et al., 2015)) and have a favorable amino acid profile compared to that of reference and food proteins (Becker, 2007). Given that cultivation of microalgae and duckweed offers some interesting options, such as a year-round biomass production and continuous harvesting, use of non-arable land, and use of brackish- or sea-water as the basis of the cultivation medium, they have been long suggested as a potential protein source to cope with increasing global food demand (Rusoff et al., 1980; Spoehr, 1953).",

Nutrients recovery and recycling is an unavoidable long-term approach for securing food and feed production (Schoumans et al., 2015; Zacharof and Lovitt, 2015). Microalgae and duckweed have been proven to integrate highly efficient nutrient recovery from wastewaters while producing highly versatile biomass (Cheng and Stomp, 2009; Olgu\u00edn, 2012; Solovchenko et al., 2016). Potential waste and wastewater streams that have been investigated for nutrient recovery include municipal wastewater, agro-industrial WaW, such as poultry, piggery, cattle, food wastes and food processing by-products (cheese whey, olive-oil mill wastes etc.), as well gaseous waste streams such as flue gases. The aptitude of microalgae and duckweed to grow on a range of waste streams has been extensively reviewed (Abinandan and Shanthakumar, 2015; Cai et al., 2013; de la No\u00fce and de Pauw, 1988; Iqbal, 1999; Journey et al., 1991; Markou and Georgakakis, 2011; Markou et al., 2014; Van Den Hende et al., 2012, 2016; Whitton et al., 2015).",

Such contaminants include inorganic pollutants like heavy metals & metalloids (HMs), pathogens, and various organic pollutants. The lack of a comprehensive review on this topic prompted us to try filling this gap. Due to the high heterogeneity in the physico-chemical characteristics of WaW, the paper will focus only on the nutrient rich agro-industrial waste streams, especially on manures and livestock wastewater. A particular focus is put on waste streams from AD technology, which is widely used to treat the agro-industrial WaW; the digestion effluents (digestates) preserve most of the inorganic nutrients from the feedstock and therefore they have been suggested as a promising source of nutrient source for microalgae and duckweed cultivation (Markou, 2015; Wang et al., 2010). We discuss the presence of pollutants that have potential health risks, the mechanism of their uptake by the cells, and pre-treatment methods that might possibly decrease the contamination of the biomass. In the following sections the most important potential contaminants from the agro-industrial WaW streams that could influence the quality of the produced biomass are discussed. The main categories of contaminants that are taken into consideration are: HMs, pathogens, and xenobiotics. An overview of the content of our review is given in Fig. 1\n.",

Some HMs concentrations in selected agro-industrial WaW are listed in Table 1\n. Most livestock manures (poultry, pig, and cattle) contain relative high amounts of HMs especially for the ones (e.g. Zn, Cu and As) that are commonly supplemented in animal feed, for growth promotion or for treatment of illnesses. HMs are usually added as highly soluble metal salts, frequently above physiological requirements and their excess amounts are excreted (Zhang et al., 2012). HMs content on manures reflects their content in feedstock, their uptake efficiency by animals, and their excretion in faeces and urine (Zhang et al., 2012).",

The species and concentrations of HMs in AD effluents are also highly depended on the feedstock (typically a mixture of animal manures and other organic wastes) and the specific ratio of the different WaW used.

As several reviews have adequately covered this topic (Anastopoulos and Kyzas, 2015; Kaplan, 2013; Perales-Vela et al., 2006; Rezania et al., 2016; Suresh Kumar et al., 2015; Ziegler et al., 2016) this overview only provides a brief description. Sorption capacities of microalgae and duckweed range between 1 and 100 mg g\u22121; however significantly lower or higher values are also reported (Table 2\n). The great variation in sorption capacities is due to the different affinities of the microalgae/duckweed species for given HMs species. Sorption is governed by the electrostatic parameters of the cell walls and the organic matrices that often encapsulate algae (Rossi and de Philippis, 2016) or by the biofilms that often cover aquatic plants (Xu and Shen, 2011); the extent and composition of these, mainly polysaccharide, matrices are dependent on the organism's physiologic status (Boney, 1981; El-Sheekh et al., 2012). Therefore, it is expected that different experimental conditions that impose different stresses on the organisms will affect effective uptake and sorption of HMs. In any case, given the high affinity of microalgae and duckweed for HMs sorption and their high accumulation into the biomass, the use of agro-industrial WaW streams presents a potential for the contamination of the produced biomass with toxic HMs. However, it should be pointed out that most research on this topic has been conducted in synthetic and mono-metallic aqueous HMs solutions containing HMs concentration of one to three orders of magnitude higher than what is eventually contained in the real WaW types (Anastopoulos and Kyzas, 2015; Rezania et al., 2016; Suresh Kumar et al., 2015), and references therein), resulting in possibly exaggerated bioaccumulation of HMs. It is expected that for HM's at the considerably lower concentrations found in real WaW, the kinetics of the HMs adsorption and uptake rates by microalgae/duckweed would be significantly distinct, with maximum accumulation values possibly lower than the ones reported for laboratory conditions. This statement is based on the HMs concentration dependent sorption isotherms where the lower the concentration of HMs in the aqueous phase the lower the equilibrium sorption. However, active uptake and intracellular bioaccumulation of HMs might not be dosage dependent as organisms can effectively remove most of the aqueous HMs from the solution (Basile et al., 2012).",

WaW co-existing ions or compounds (organic or inorganic), might decrease or increase HMs sorption degree through antagonistic or synergistic effects, respectively. However, the typical, and therefore more frequent observation, is that co-existing ions or other charged compounds counteract or compete with HMs decreasing the available sorption sites on the surface of biomass resulting in lower HMs uptake by the cells (Deng et al., 2006; Malik, 2004; Tsezos et al., 1996).

Under such conditions pH reaches values \u226b9 (Markou et al., 2014). It is expected that alkalization enhances sorption of cationic HMs (Verma and Suthar, 2015) as the functional groups on the biomass surface become deprotonated, with increased negative charges that increasingly favour the binding of metal cations (Monteiro et al., 2012). However, at high pH, the complex ionic structure of WaW creates condition favorable for ionic complexation of HMs and co-precipitation (Monteiro et al., 2012; Toumi et al., 2000), decreasing thus the availability of HMs for uptake by microalgae. More research is required to develop applied strategies for inhibiting HMs uptake by the cells. Regarding duckweed, they typically tend to equilibrate the pH at 8\u20138.5 (McLay, 1976; Xu et al., 2012), where HMs precipitation potential still exists, however lower than that for microalgal cultivation systems.",

Surface sorption is an electrostatic phenomenon that is governed by the totality of charged loci on the surface of cells, associated with compounds such as polysaccharides and mucilage (Boney, 1981) or cell walls components. The latter consist mainly of carbohydrates, proteins and lipids, which offer several surface functional groups such as \u2014COOH, \u2014OH, \u2014PO3, \u2014NH2, \u2014SH that adsorb HMs through counter-ion interactions (Kaplan, 2013; Suresh Kumar et al., 2015). Surface sorption could be further divided into (i) ion-exchange, (ii) physical adsorption, (iii) complexation, (iv) precipitation, and (v) entrapment (Perales-Vela et al., 2006; Suresh Kumar et al., 2014). Surface sorption is a non-metabolic mechanism, i.e. no active metabolic process takes place for HMs uptake and therefore it is rapid, and occurs in both living and non-living cells (Kaplan, 2013). Surface sorption is a reversible process (Suresh Kumar et al., 2014) and therefore provides the opportunity of de-contamination of biomass by desorbing HMs, with salts/acids/bases or chelators.",

            "text": "Intracellular accumulation occurs also in both living and non-living cells and occurs by either passive diffusion or active transmembrane transport (Arg\u00fcello et al., 2012). Active transport is a metabolically-driven process by which HMs cross the cell wall membrane through energy expending mechanisms, and thus only occurs in living cells. Intracellularly the HMs are finally bound in various organelles (in case of eukaryotic microalgae) and cell compartments (in case of cyanobacteria), such as mitochondria and chloroplasts, polyphosphate bodies, vacuoles, endodermal cells, or also on surface of tissues (in case of duckweed) (Basile et al., 2012; Perales-Vela et al., 2006). Even while the cells have the ability to discriminate between non-essential and essential HMs for their metabolism (Perales-Vela et al., 2006), when the extracellular concentration of HMs is considerably higher than its intracellular concentration, then they may actively transport HMs across their cell membranes into the cytoplasm in order to store them and neutralize their potential toxicity (Monteiro et al., 2009; Perales-Vela et al., 2006). However, for both microalgae and duckweeds, if the HMs concentration exceeds a certain threshold (a function of both the HMs and the organism), it might result in inhibition of growth and lowered uptake as toxicity manifests itself in lowered metabolic activity. Intracellular accumulation is slow and irreversible, restricting the potential for de-contaminating the biomass by desorption. The overall degree of intracellular accumulation of HMs is species and strain dependent (Matsunaga et al., 1999; Suresh Kumar et al., 2015) and can reach 15\u201365% of the total bioaccumulated HMs. Surface adsorption or intracellular accumulation of HMs in duckweeds is insufficiently studied.",

Ion-exchange is expensive especially when treating large volumes of wastewater containing HMs at low concentrations. Adsorption using activated carbon is also expensive, while adsorption by low cost adsorbents, such as certain bio-residues, is a relatively new process and yet technically undeveloped. Membrane filtration technology while very efficient for HMs removal, it is, however, uneconomical for agro-industrial wastewaters that contain high organic loads and suspended solids which leads to membrane fouling and low permeate flux. Coagulation and flocculation are efficient but consume a lot of chemicals. Flotation and electrochemical treatments have high initial capital, maintenance and operation costs.

Marcato et al. (2008) found that in anaerobically digested pig slurry most of Cu and Zn was retained in particle with sizes between 3 and 25 \u03bcm, with only 3% bound on >250 \u03bcm particles. While, duckweed could be cultivated on unseparated digestates, microalgae may be cultured only in the liquid fraction of digestates, preferably filtered, as any residual solids decrease light penetration or may lead to cells clumping (Uggetti et al., 2014; Xia and Murphy, 2016). Nevertheless, solid/liquid separation may be effective for decreasing HMs in the liquid fraction of an AD effluents used for microalgae or duckweed growth. Moreover, given that usually the AD liquids are diluted at least 10 times, this may lead to a significant decrease in the concentration of HMs in the cultivation media.

Microalgae and duckweed can synthetize polypeptides with the amino acid sequence (gGlu-Cys)n-Gly (n = 2\u201311), known as phytochelatins (Le Faucheur et al., 2005), as a protective response to the stress induced by the presence of HMs. Chelating agents bond with metal ions, creating metal-chelate coordination complexes, either inside or outside of the cells, which render metal ions inactive (Miazek et al., 2015). However, where HMs are adsorbed onto the suspended particles, as might be the case for WaW, the addition or synthesis of chelators could create an unbalance in the concentration of HMs between the adsorbed and soluble compartments, which can lead to desorption and possibly an increase in HMs uptake by microalgae or duckweed. Such a scenario has been confirmed for duckweed cultured in the presence of EDTA (Dipu et al., 2012).",

However, a change of pH would also affect growth parameters and thus at this point this is only a hypothesis that requires more investigation. On the other hand, certain micronutrient HMs (e.g. Cu, Zn, Se), are essential for plant and animal metabolism. Saeid et al. (2016) demonstrated that Spirulina biomass enriched in Cu and Fe, through biosorption, enhanced the growth of laying hens and egg characteristics, above the results obtained by direct addition of these micronutrients to feed in a salt form. Thus, biosorption of essential HMs from WaW could be of interest for the production of feed biomass enriched in recycled micronutrients.",

Pasteurization entails increasing the temperature, typically to 70 \u00b0C, for several minutes (30\u201360 min). It is effective and eliminates most pathogens (e.g. bacterial indicators, Ascaris suum eggs, swine vesicular disease virus), however it does not eliminate spore-forming bacteria, like Clostridium spores or viruses such as porcine parvovirus (Bagge et al., 2010; Sahlstr\u00f6m et al., 2008). Increasing the pasteurization temperature at 90 \u00b0C could result in a more reliable inactivation of bacteria, heat-resistant viruses and parasites (Martens and B\u00f6hm, 2009). It is however an energy intensive process that could be economically feasible when waste thermal energy is available, such as in biogas production plants. UV irradiation can achieve high reduction of enteric bacterial and protozoan pathogens (2\u20135 log10), however some viruses are relatively resistant to UV irradiation (Bilotta and Kunz, 2013; Sobsey et al., 2006). UV irradiation does not generate any unwanted residuals and does not alter the nutritional composition of WaW. Although filtration (ultra- and nano-filtration) is effective to remove pathogens (even prions) (Yunoki et al., 2008), its application for large volumes of WaW, at an industrial scale as required for effective biomass production, is hindered by the presence of the various suspended and dissolved solids.",

            "text": "This category includes alkaline treatment, chlorination, ozonation, and advanced oxidation processes. Alkaline treatment involves the addition of alkali, like \u039a\u039f\u0397, CaO or Ca(OH)2, and mixes with other materials like ash, to reach a pH > 12. The most frequent alkaline treatment is lime stabilization (CaO or Ca(OH)2). This is effective for most pathogens, with reduction of fecal coliforms, Salmonella sp., helminth eggs and protozoan oocysts up to 98\u201399.99% that can be achieved after a few hours of stabilization (Sobsey et al., 2006; Viancelli et al., 2015; Wong and Selvam, 2009). However, alkaline stabilization can also precipitate nutrients such as phosphorus. Combining alkaline treatment with heat favours alkaline hydrolysis, a confirmed reliable method for inactivation of pathogens (Kaye et al., 1998). Hydrolysates thus obtained might contain amino acids and sugars that may be directly assimilated by microalgae or duckweeds (Markou et al., 2014) offering an attractive source of organics for mixotrophic or heterotrophic growth. Chlorination is the most cost-effective process for wastewater disinfection (Amin et al., 2013; Rodr\u00edguez-Chueca et al., 2015); however the main drawback is the formation of toxic and carcinogenic by-products. Moreover, although chlorination is very effective for inactivation of bacteria it is less effective for reduction of viruses and protozoa (Sobsey et al., 2006). Ozonation is effective for inactivation of bacteria, viruses and protozoa; however organic matter in WaW can inactivate ozone which limits the efficacy of the method leading to requirements for high ozone doses (1\u20132 g L\u22121) (Sobsey et al., 2006; Watkins et al., 1997; Wu et al., 1998). Ozonation does not alter the nitrogen and phosphorus content of the wastewater (Watkins et al., 1997; Wu et al., 1998). The use of advanced oxidation processes for agro-industrial WaW could be more appropriate since organic matter is degraded during the process and does not interfere with the disinfection ability. Advanced oxidation processes are effective for disinfection giving bacterial reduction higher than 3 log10 (Rodr\u00edguez-Chueca et al., 2015) and have been widely studied for agro-industrial WaW (Deng and Zhao, 2015; Matilainen and Sillanp\u00e4\u00e4, 2010; Oller et al., 2011; Wagner et al., 2002). However, more research is needed around the formation of potentially toxic intermediate products (Oller et al., 2011; S\u00e4rkk\u00e4 et al., 2015).",

            "text": "Agro-industrial WaW are treated mainly by biological methods, such as stabilization lagoons and AD. Other biological methods such as aerobic digestion, biofilters, activated sludge or constructed wetlands are not commonly employed for agro-industrial WaW. Stabilization lagoons (aerated, anaerobic, facultative or multiple configurations) offer low-cost options for WaW treatment. Especially multiple stabilization ponds are more effective in pathogens reduction (2\u20136 log10) than single ponds (1\u20133 log10) (Sobsey et al., 2006; Viancelli et al., 2013). However, they require long retention times (>3 months), their performance is not consistent, and depend significantly on environmental parameters (Sobsey et al., 2006). Moreover, due to the long retention times required high loss of nutrients could occur; over 80% of N could be lost through ammonia volatilization (Rockne and Brezonik, 2006). Among the biological methods for agro-industrial WaW treatment, AD is increasingly gaining interest because of the simultaneous treatment of the WaW and the production of biogas, which is an energy carrier that can be used to produce electricity/thermal energy or transportation fuels (biomethane) (Weiland, 2010). AD may be performed either in the psychrophilic (temperature of the environment), mesophilic (30\u201340 \u00b0C) or thermophilic (45\u201365 \u00b0C) temperature ranges. Most frequently AD is carried out in the mesophilic range, as it is more robust compared to the thermophilic range digestion. The latter exhibits uncertainty in methanogenesis, especially when the ammoniacal nitrogen concentration of the waste liquor is relative high (Moset et al., 2015; Yenig\u00fcn and Demirel, 2013). Thermophilic AD is nonetheless more effective for pathogen reduction (Table 4\n). Nevertheless, thermophilic digestion does not inactivate spore-forming pathogens of Clostridium or Bacillus (Bagge et al., 2010; Sahlstr\u00f6m, 2003). An increase in organic acids (volatile fatty acids, such as acetate) in the digestion liquor may substantially reduce spore-forming pathogens (Salsali et al., 2008; Xu et al., 2015) and thus a two-phase thermophilic/mesophilic configuration could be applied to address such pathogens (Huyard et al., 2000). Such an approach might also overcome the instabilities of the thermophilic reactors. In practice, a pasteurization stage (70 \u00b0C for 1 h) either before or after the mesophilic AD is included to ensure the hygiene of the effluents (Sahlstr\u00f6m, 2003). Still, pasteurization does not fully inactivates all spore-forming microorganisms (bacteria or fungi) (Bagge et al., 2010; Sahlstr\u00f6m, 2003; Schn\u00fcrer and Schn\u00fcrer, 2006) and it was proposed to combine it with alkaline hydrolysis for increasing the reliability of disinfection (Kaye et al., 1998). In general, the wide diversity of pathogens renders WaW difficult to disinfection via a single technology, and often a combination of technologies is required (Viancelli et al., 2013). Wastewater treatment research shows that pathogens partition between the solid and the liquid phase at variable proportions is a function of the treatment option and the status of the abiotic parameters in the treatment system (van der Drift et al., 1977; Zhang and Farahbakhsh, 2007). Nevertheless, studies directly focusing on the distribution of pathogens between the solid and liquid fractions after separation are scarce. It was found however, that most indicator pathogens were retained in the liquid fraction (Liu et al., 2017). Additionally, improved animal management and housing techniques could also contribute in reducing pathogen load in animal WaW. Such techniques include vaccination and antibiotic therapy, adjustments of animal diets, on-farm hygienic and sanitation actions, and livestock housing management (Sobsey et al., 2006).",

            "text": "A question of particular interest regarding the growth of aquatic organisms in agro-industrial WaW is whether the various pathogens harboured by WaW may contaminate biomass and what are the mechanisms of contamination. There are numerous studies investigating the interaction of microalgae or duckweeds with bacteria (Fuentes et al., 2016; Underwood and Baker, 1991), viruses (Short, 2012) or protozoan grazers (Tillmann, 2004) and their symbiotic, antagonistic or parasitic relationships. However, there is insufficient direct evidence on whether microalgae or duckweeds might host human or animal pathogens. Considering the known capacity of viruses or bacteria to interact with particles in suspension, it can be hypothesized that potential mechanisms for contamination of biomass with pathogens would involve adsorption of pathogens on microalgal/duckweed biomass surface (Fig. 2) through the variably distributed hydrophilic and hydrophobic loci on both the surface of bacteria and the algae or duckweeds (Marshall, 1985; Verbyla and Mihelcic, 2015) and the role of the ionic composition, i.e. pH and ionic strength, in modifying the net expression of these charges. The geometry of the interacting surfaces is also critical, and as this varies among microorganisms it affects the effective range of the electrostatic interactions, and the thus strength of adsorption. Production of charged compounds, such as polysaccharide capsules, or certain proteins (e.g. adhesins) will enhance the likelihood and strength of attachment. Often such compounds are produced under non-ideal conditions and thus management of the growth conditions might modify the attachment kinetics.",

            "text": "On the other hand, it has been frequently reported that during microalgae or duckweeds cultivation on wastewater certain indicator bacteria were significantly reduced (Heubeck et al., 2007; Iqbal, 1999; Posadas et al., 2015; Schumacher et al., 2003). For example, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Enterococcus faecalis were reduced by 3\u20134 log in cultures of the microalga Scenedesmus sp. (Al-Gheethi et al., 2017). It is unclear, however, if such reduction was attained through pathogen death, inactivation, or is an artefact of the testing procedure. In general, potential mechanisms for the removal/inactivation of pathogen in microalgal cultures systems include (i) inactivation through solar irradiation (UV), (ii) drastic shift in pH, either due to the photosynthesis linked pH increase (>9\u20139.5), or due to rapid acidification to pH of 1\u20132, as obtained when extremophiles such as Galdieria sp. are cultured in wastewaters (Henkanatte-Gedera et al., 2017), (iii) photosynthesis driven increases in dissolved oxygen concentrations in the cultivation media, and (iv) the production and excretion of antibacterial substances by algae (Heubeck et al., 2007; Posadas et al., 2015). In case of duckweeds, many of these pathogen removals methods are expected to be unpractical or less effective as the floating duckweed plants shade the cultivation media minimizing solar irradiation and, given that photosynthesis occurs above the water-air interface, also minimizes any drastic effect on the pH or dissolved oxygen of the media (pH 8\u20138.5) (Dewedar and Bahgat, 1995; McLay, 1976; Smith and Moelyowati, 2001; Xu et al., 2012\n). There are some indications however, that duckweeds cultivated in municipal (Moyo et al., 2003) or even hospital-based wastewater (Islam et al., 2004) might be safe to use as feed because it was found that they were not contaminated with pathogens. More insight into such observations is needed to support any decision making.",

Some parasiticides, such as synthetic pyrethroids are of concern for human health as they are known disruptors of the endocrine system (Coleman et al., 2013; Khan et al., 2008). Given their diversity in chemistry they vary considerably in their excretion rates by animals. Some organophosphate and carbamate compounds might be efficiently metabolized, while other compounds, such as synthetic pyrethroids, benzylphenyl ureas, macrocyclic lactones and fluazuron, are excreted without much change in mass (Khan et al., 2008). Their discontinuous use in livestock, seasonal or as needed, leads to large variations in their concentrations in manures. For example, Coleman et al. (2013) found that the concentration of abamectin, ivemectin and doramectin in fresh or stored manure range between <1 and 36 \u03bcg kg\u22121.",

Mycotoxins could be a concern if contaminated agro-food wastes and by-products are used as nutrient source for growing microalgae/duckweed. Fungi can easily contaminate agro-food products generating mycotoxins, such as ochratoxin, zearalone, deoxynivalenol, which can have a wide range of effects including carcinogenicity, neurotoxicity, and developmental toxicity (Ajila et al., 2012; Kolpin et al., 2014). Dioxins are halogenated organic compounds generated in industrial processes. Many dioxins are persistent and have become abundant in the environment; livestock is exposed to dioxins mainly by consuming feed contaminated by airborne dioxins (Khan et al., 2008). It is unclear if these are of great significance in liquid growth systems, but they can easily contaminate biomass post-growth.",

The total estrogen content is generally removed only to a small degree (<22%) (Combalbert et al., 2012; des Mes et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2014b; Zheng et al., 2012), although, removals higher than 50% have also been reported (Paterakis et al., 2012). Hormones have low Henry's constants (in the order of magnitude of 10\u221211 (atm L\u22121 mol\u22121) and have hydrophobic properties (octanol/water partition coefficient, Kow, of about 2.41\u20134.01) and consequently they display a great affinity for adsorbtion onto (bio)solids (Chawla et al., 2014). It is expected therefore that after solid/liquid separation of digestates estrogens will be largely retained within the solid fraction, thus reducing the amount in the liquid phase that would be used for cultivation of algae and duckweeds. Moreover, it might be possible that they form sulfate-conjugated forms in manures, that are more recalcitrant to biodegradation than the free estrogen forms (Combalbert et al., 2012; des Mes et al., 2008). It seems that aerobic conditions, either as aerated reactors or by aerobic composting, are necessary for a significant (>70%) removal of estrogens (Zhang et al., 2014b; Zhao, 2008).",

Table 6 lists the impact of AD on the removal rates of antibiotics. The degree of degradation varies significantly and depends on the antibiotic compound and the AD parameters. A general trend observed in studies dealing with oxytetracycline, chlortetracycline, sulfonamides and tylosin is that they are relatively quickly transformed into intermediate products, which are then either further degraded or persist. Persistence of antibiotics is probably related to their capacity to be adsorbed onto (bio)solids increasing their stability (\u00c1lvarez et al., 2010); e.g. the water soluble fraction of oxytetracycline was degraded significantly more (up to 85%) than the solid bound fraction (\u00c1lvarez et al., 2010). Tylosin was completely removed after 4 days; however the two degradation products formed persisted at least 40 days with 20\u201350% adsorbed onto solids and the rest remaining in the liquid phase (Mitchell et al., 2013). In some cases, like for chlortetracycline, the concentrations of water-soluble degradation products increased about 2-fold during digestion (Arikan, 2008). Any concern regarding these degradation by-products is directly related to whether the transformation products display the same or different antibiotic activities.",

Dioxins are considered to be highly resistant to biodegradation probably due to their low water solubility and high Kow coefficients (Kulkarni et al., 2008). After 6 months of AD the concentration of some dioxins (polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans) has been shown to remain unchanged while some other dioxins (3-chlorophenol and 3,4-dichlorophenol) were newly generated; however, pentachlorophenol concentration decreased 57% (Najmanov\u00e1 et al., 2014).",

Among the removal mechanisms, it was shown that photodegradation and direct oxidation accounted for a small fraction of the total estrogen removal (Maes et al., 2014; Shi et al., 2010; Zhang et al., 2014c). On the other hand, even as the final removal of total estrogen can reach over than 85%, it was shown that the estrogenic activity of the medium was not reduced suggesting that the degradation products displayed the same or higher estrogenic activity compared to the parent compounds (Zhang et al., 2014c). Estrogen sorption onto biomass can range between 4 and 58% and might depend on the species of the organism, the estrogen concentration, or other cultivation parameters (Hom-Diaz et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2014c). The degree of intracellular concentration of estrogen has not yet been extensively investigated; however, it was shown that the microalga Desmodesmus subspicatus incorporated around 23% EE2 from its surrounding medium after 24 h, with no further uptake. After re-incubation of contaminated cells in clean medium a portion of EE2 was desorbed, but 30% of the initially incorporated estrogen remained in the microalgal biomass (Maes et al., 2014), suggesting, at least partially, a gradient driven adsorption onto cell surfaces.",

There is a vast literature about their toxic effects on phytoplankton and plants, however fewer reports exist on their removal using microalgae or duckweed, and research about the contamination of microalgal or duckweed biomass is scarce (Dosnon-Olette et al., 2010; Olette et al., 2008; Weiner et al., 2004). Microalgae and duckweed might degrade some parasiticides like deltamethrin (Muir et al., 1985) or diazinon (Kurade et al., 2016) forming several other degradation by-products. There are no available data regarding mycotoxins, only one report that indicates that algae (unspecified) were not able to degrade aflatoxin (Ciegler et al., 1966); there are only a few reports on the ability of microalgae to degrade dioxins and various other persistent organic pollutants (Cepoi et al., 2016). Concerning the biomass contamination, it was shown that the pyrethroid deltamethrin parasiticide was rapidly accumulated by Lemna sp. during the initial 24 h reaching 253 and 308 ng g\u22121 dry weight, and that this dropped to <50% after 3 days due to degradation (Muir et al., 1985). Weiner et al. (2004) found that a correlation between atrazine uptake and microalgal species-sensitivity to the compound exists. The more sensitive species accumulated more atrazine than less sensitive species. It was hypothesized that less sensitive species may actively pump atrazine out of the cell or may degrade it intracellularly.",

Thus, it is of interest to identify if the production of high-value metabolites could be coupled with the use of WaW in the context of circular economy, while on the other hand might reduce biomass production costs. However, the potential of transferring contaminants, e.g. HMs, pathogens or xenobiotics that originate in WaW, to the extracted products is possible and thus a concern.

            "text": "A first key step for the extraction of the metabolites is the disruption of cells to facilitate access on the intracellular ingredients. Microalgae and duckweed have relatively rigid cell walls (compared to bacteria or yeast) requiring harsher techniques for the disruption of cell walls or tissues. Cell disruption methods may be grouped into two categories: (1) mechanical and (2) non-mechanical (G\u00fcnerken et al., 2015): mechanical methods include (i) bead milling, (ii) high-pressure homogenization, (iii) high-speed homogenization, (iv) ultrasonication, (v) microwave, and (vi) pulsed electric field treatments; non-mechanical methods include (i) enzymatic cell lysis and (ii) chemical cell disruption (G\u00fcnerken et al., 2015). Some cell disruption technologies (like the chemical ones) can also simultaneously extract some target metabolites. The core stage of metabolite extraction is conducted mainly by chemical methods (organic solvents, alkali or acid salts, polymer -salts, super- or subcritical fluids extraction etc.) that might be assisted by mechanical methods (such as microwave) followed by product purification using chromatographic technologies (ion-exchange, gel filtration, expanded bed absorption etc.), membrane separation (micro-, ultra-, and nano-filtration or reverse osmosis) or chemical (caustic refining etc.) (Cuellar-Bermudez et al., 2015; G\u00fcnerken et al., 2015; Gerardo et al., 2014). The method applied for cell disruption, metabolite extraction and purification depends on the physico-chemical characteristics of tissues and the cell membranes and the target compound(s), the latter determined mainly by their hydrophilic (phycobilins, some proteins, sugars etc.) or hydrophobic (lipid-based pigments, fatty acids etc.) properties. Some cell disruption methods such as high-speed homogenization (Dong et al., 2015) or bead milling (Doucha and L\u00edvansk\u00fd, 2008) could further contribute to cell lysis, however it is expected to have little to no effect on HMs or xenobiotics. Given that contaminants have also hydrophilic or hydrophobic properties they could be extracted along with the target compound(s). It seems that the purification step might be the most critical because here highly efficient separation technologies could be applied in order to obtain a pure and safe product for consumption. More research to elucidate these points is critical.",

While there are major commonalities, the particularities of the local regulatory systems offer a wide range of variability in the regulations and their implementation strategies. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations has set a series of standards and recommendations in the Codex Alimentarius (Codex Stan 193-1995) to address the presence of contaminants, such as HMs and toxins in food and feed and listing their maximum levels (ML) (Table 7\nlists the ML of most significant contaminants). FAO Codex Alimentarius points out the significance of the Good Agricultural Practice (GAP) and Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) in order to achieve a low as reasonably presence of contaminants in feed and food. GAP and GMP includes the following activities to prevent or to reduce contamination of feed and food (CAC, 1995): \u201c(i) preventing food and feed contamination at the source, e.g. by reducing environmental pollution, (ii) applying appropriate technology control measure(s) in food and feed production, manufacture, processing, preparation, treatment, packing, packaging, transport or holding, and (iii) applying measures aimed at decontamination of contaminated feed or food and measures to prevent contaminated feed or food to be marketed for consumption\u201d.

            "text": "Likewise, most countries lay down rules for agro-industrial wastes and wastewater management, in order to ensure an adequate level of safety and protection of public health. Typically, WaW are categorized based on their risk potential. Some WaW are not allowed to be applied to crops intended for human consumptions, e.g. municipal source WaW, while some highly hazardous WaW, e.g. hospital waste, are not permitted to be used for agriculture and must be disposed after appropriate treatment, including incineration. Other categories (including agro-industrial wastes and wastewater) might be used for the production of various commodities (such as organic fertilizers etc.) after appropriate treatment, such as composting or AD (see for example the EU REGULATION (EC) No 1069/2009). For most terrestrial plants transfer of contaminants from land applied waste to plant occurs via roots which act to mitigate the movement of contaminants into the above ground edible parts of the plant, and while many contaminants may accumulate in plant tissues they are often below most relevant risk thresholds (Chiou, 2003). Inadvertent transfer, e.g. via splashing during rain of irrigation events, is less likely to occur in massive doses (Heaton and Jones, 2008).",

Human waste and animal by-products are more strictly regulated due to their more obvious health risks. Thus, many countries have developed their own regulations regarding the presence of various contaminants in feed or food, by setting Acceptable Daily Intakes, Acute Reference Doses, or recommendations for Maximum Residue Levels, and often impose strict safety monitoring processes. These regulations are of particular relevance for the initiation of a discussion on whether processed agro-industrial WaW might and ought to be used for cultivating microalgae or duckweed for feed or food production. In Table 8\nthe various potential contaminants, their removal during AD and cultivation along with an estimation of contamination risks are summarized. Contamination of biomass could occur either due to the adsorption of contaminants on surface or due to the intracellular accumulation. Surface adsorbed contaminants could be desorbed thus decontaminating the biomass, while the intracellularly accumulated contaminants cannot be removed, unless they are biodegraded into harmless byproducts. It is important to identify strategies and devise methods to either reduce the concentration of contaminants in the growth media, e.g. by pre-treating of WaW streams, or to manipulate the cultivation conditions in order to inhibit uptake of contaminants by microalgae and duckweed, thus mitigating biomass contamination. Nevertheless, it is rather obvious that the topic of biomass contamination deserves further investigation and offers a wide scope for research.",
