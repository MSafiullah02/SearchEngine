This allows for the majority of our program's residents to be away from the hospital or potentially available to aid any medical or critical care team as models project the pandemic to worsen. This plan promotes safety and flexibility of our team members, opportunities for professional and academic advancement, and personal time for those with families and children. Each day, the layout of resident coverage is as follows:\u2022One junior-level resident is designated as the \u201con call\u201d resident for the 2 adult hospitals. This individual is on call all day and all night from the comfort of their home if possible. That resident will cover the \u201chigh-priority\u201c scheduled surgical cases that are scheduled at the hospital along with floorwork. An effort is made to ensure that each junior, mid-level, and senior resident have an equal number of call days over the course of the month with appropriate time off in between, all while adhering to the unchanged Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education's (ACGME) 80-hour work week laws for medical residents.3\n\u2022\u2022\n\u2022Only emergent consults should be seen by the junior-level resident in order to limit patient interaction and the potential spread of COVID-19. A call is made to the primary team in order to discuss the goals and necessity of each consult. A decision is made as to whether or not the patient can be seen as an outpatient via virtual visit, or whether they need to be seen in person in the hospital. Virtual methods can be used such as Facetime in order to perform limited physical examination if needed.\u2022One senior resident is designated as the \u201cbackup\u201d point of contact and is in the hospital during the day to help with major cases (high priority robotic procedures). That resident is then free to leave the hospital after the completion of these procedures. They are the point of contact if there are any questions from the junior-level resident throughout the rest of the day and evening.\u2022One senior resident is to cover the children's hospital via home call. Quickly following the declaration of a pandemic, a decision was made for the pediatric urology department to cancel all elective surgeries and nonessential office visits. Therefore, the pediatric urology resident on call is to cover any urgent evaluations in the Emergency Room. Any nonurgent consults are to be discussed with the pediatric urology attending on call prior to evaluation in person.\n",

Our program's senior residents and staff arrive at a collective decision as to whether or not the consult must be seen urgently in the hospital, or if it can be addressed in the outpatient setting. Recommendations are made to the primary team if the consult is deemed nonurgent, and the patient is instructed to follow up outpatient via virtual visit. We believe that this practice will still allow for urgent urologic care to be provided, while limiting our potential role as vectors of disease transmission.",

The current COVID-19 pandemic has provided our residency with unique opportunities to explore different virtual learning options. Each weekday, our residency program hosts a daily check-in at 4 PM where we discuss the assigned topic for that day. The daily check-in is conducted on a virtual platform such as Skype or Zoom. Our program traditionally holds a 3-hour morning academic conference each Wednesday morning, with the first Wednesday of each month being dedicated to pediatrics. This is a practice our program has continued to follow during this pandemic. Various interesting cases, assigned Campbell's chapters, and specific topics chosen by faculty are all presented during this 3-hour block. Faculty members at all 3 hospitals that are associated with our program are encouraged to join and contribute at these daily virtual meetings. The daily discussion topics are listed as follows:\u2022Monday\u2014Indications for the major \u201chigh-priority elective\u201d robotic cases for that week, complete with NCCN guidelines for staging and follow-up along with intraoperative surgical principles.\u2022Tuesday\u2014AUA updates (typically 2).\u2022Wednesday\u2014Previously described morning conference from 7 to 10 A.M.\u2022Thursday\u2014Journal articles that would have been discussed at our monthly journal club meeting (typically 8 articles), are now discussed each Thursday (typically 2).\u2022Friday\u2014Faculty/guest (previous graduate of the program) lecture or AUA Core curriculum topic of choice.\n",

For example, telemedicine and virtual visits have become the primary and safest forms of outpatient clinical care for all of our program's attending physicians. A recent article by Forbes highlighted the substantial uptick in telehealth popularity, with increased rates of usage ranging from 257% to 700% over a variety of platforms since the COVID-19 outbreak.5\n\u2022\u2022 While telemedicine has been around for a few decades, the current situation may serve as the future gold standard for outpatient care. Telemedicine within the field of urology is not commonplace compared to other specialties, but has been suggested in the effort to improve value-based urologic care.6\n\u2022 Our program has traditionally consisted of a weekly in-person clinic requirement as part of our patient care curriculum, however, virtual visits may soon assume this role as the pandemic progresses toward its national peak.",
