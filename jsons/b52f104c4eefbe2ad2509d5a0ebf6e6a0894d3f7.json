They were implemented for the first time in China in February, 2020, to tackle the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak. The Fangcang shelter hospitals in China were large-scale, temporary hospitals, rapidly built by converting existing public venues, such as stadiums and exhibition centres, into health-care facilities. They served to isolate patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 from their families and communities, while providing medical care, disease monitoring, food, shelter, and social activities. We document the development of Fangcang shelter hospitals during the COVID-19 outbreak in China and explain their three key characteristics (rapid construction, massive scale, and low cost) and five essential functions (isolation, triage, basic medical care, frequent monitoring and rapid referral, and essential living and social engagement).

            "text": "The experience with Fangcang shelter hospitals during the COVID-19 outbreak in China suggests that they could be powerfully employed in future public health emergencies, in particular other epidemics, but also during other events involving illness or injury on a large or rapidly growing scale, such as mass poisonings or natural disasters. The Fangcang shelter hospitals, which can be rapidly established, 4, 5 can provide large numbers of hospital beds and appropriate care for patients who do not have severe or critical disease. 5, 6 Health workers at Fangcang shelter hospitals can transfer patients to higher-level hospitals for more complex treatment if their conditions worsen. 6 Fangcang shelter hospitals can also offer emotional and social support to help patients recover and thrive during an otherwise disruptive period in their lives. 6 In this report, we document the conception and dev elop ment of Fangcang shelter hospitals during the COVID-19 outbreak in China, describe their key characteristics and essential functions, discuss critical issues for the success of Fangcang shelter hospitals, and consider applications of the concept as part of the COVID-19 public health response in other countries. on the city's medical system. 7 At the beginning of February, 2020, Wuhan had no beds available for COVID-19 patients in the hospitals designated for treating the virus. 8 Thousands of patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 had to be sent home for isolation and observation. With a shortage of hospital beds, Wuhan needed an approach to rapidly and massively scale its capacity to isolate and care for patients with mild to moderate COVID-19. As the outbreak in Wuhan reached its most severe point, with thousands of new infections per day, the city opened three Fangcang shelter hospitals on Feb 5, 2020, by converting exhibition centres and stadiums. Over the following weeks, Wuhan opened an additional 13 Fangcang shelter hospitals. 9 Figure 1 shows the progression of bed capacity and occupancy of the Fangcang shelter hospitals over time. As the epidemic in Wuhan subsided and bed occupancy moved towards zero, the Fangcang shelter hospitals were successively suspended. The first hospital closed on March 1, 2020; by March 10, all Fangcang shelter hospitals had been suspended. 10, 11 Home isolation is an important alternative to hospital isolation, which requires behaviour change but no additional infrastructure investment. Chinese policy makers decided against home isolation of patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 for a number of important reasons. 12, 13 First, home isolation puts patients' family members at risk. Early epidemiological evidence in China showed that more than half of all patients with COVID-19 had at least one family member with the disease, and 75-80% of all clustered infections were within families, suggesting high rates of intrafamily transmission. [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] Second, patients can find home isolation psychologically taxing, because they know that they are putting those they care about most at risk of contracting the disease. 19, 20 Third, home isolation is unlikely to be fully effective because it cannot be strictly enforced. Patients might break with the mandated behaviour to stay at home and go outside for errands, entertainment, or exercise. Lastly, it is difficult to organise medical care, frequent monitoring of disease progression, and timely referral to hospital care for thousands of patients in home isolation. 21 COVID-19 can deteriorate from mild or moderate to severe illness, requiring rapid referral to hospital care. [16] [17] [18] In home isolation in Wuhan, before the introduction of the Fangcang shelter hospitals, the time from onset of severe symptoms to admission to a tertiary hospital for intensive care was up to 10 days. 8, 22 The Fangcang shelter hospitals substantially reduced these delays.",

China thus needed a novel approach to control the COVID-19 out break in Wuhan. In response, Chinese officials and experts developed the Fangcang shelter hospital: large health-care facilities that were built overnight and provided isolation, triage, medical care, monitoring and referral, shelter, and social engagement. The hospitals were built in existing public venues by installing beds, sheltered space, and the three zones and two passages (san qu liang tong dao) of hospital isolation wards. [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] Figure 2 shows one of the Fangcang shelter hospitals in Wuhan with three zones-a contaminated zone where patients live, a semi-clean zone where health workers put on and take off their protective suits, and a clean zone where supplies are received-and two passages, one for patients and the other for health workers. Although Fangcang shelter hospitals have some historic precedents, such as makeshift hospitals, emergency field hospitals, emergency shelters, and hospital isolation wards, 30-32 they have three distinct characteristics and five functions that set them apart from facilities that have previously been used for the control of public health emergencies.",

Fangcang shelter hospitals can be built quickly because they are based inside existing physical infrastructure. The conversion process, in which buildings that served other purposes (eg, sports venues or exhibition centres) were turned into hospitals, was completed in 29 hours for the first three Fangcang shelter hospitals in Wuhan, providing 4000 beds. 4, 5 This process involved some interior redesign of spaces and purchasing and installing beds, medical devices, and supplies to support care, monitoring, and sheltered living.",

            "text": "The second characteristic is massive scale. Fangcang shelter hospitals leverage large-scale public venues, which, once they have been converted to serve hospital functions, result in a large increase in health-care capacity (figure 1). The built over a period of 3 weeks contained 13 000 hospitals beds (figure 4). By March 10, 2020, the 16 hospitals had provided care to about 12 000 patients. 34 In caring for and sheltering such a large number of patients who would otherwise have been confined to their homes, these shelter hospitals effectively supported China's COVID-19 policy of leaving no patient unattended or untreated. 35 The third characteristic is the low cost of building and running Fangcang shelter hospitals. Investment costs are low because converting public venues into health-care facilities avoids costly construction of new physical infrastructure. Equally, once the epidemic has subsided, the structures can be returned to their original purposes, avoiding long-term, inefficient use of space, which is a particularly important consideration in a densely populated city. Running costs are low because Fangcang shelter hospitals require fewer doctors and nurses than traditional hospitals. 36 The low health worker-to-patient ratio is for two reasons: first, all patients in the hospital share the same primary admission diagnosis, reducing the complexity of care, and second, all patients have only mild to moderate disease. 9,37 By isolating and treating only mild to moderate cases, Fangcang shelter hospitals in Wuhan freed up the scarce medical infra structure of higher-level hospitals, such as the inpatient units providing respiratory support and intensive care, for patients with severe to critical COVID-19 and other patients requiring critical or complex care. More than 90% of severe cases in Hubei province were in Wuhan, 38 and the bed vacancy rate in the traditional hospitals designated for the care of patients with COVID-19 increased from 4% on Feb 4, 2020 (before the first Fangcang shelter hospitals had opened) to 16% on Feb 22, when 16 Fangcang shelter hospitals had started admitting patients. 38 The Fangcang shelter hospitals improved the distribution of patients with COVID-19 according to the severity of their symptoms, increasing the overall efficiency of care. Figure 3 summarises the functions of Fangcang shelter hospitals. The first essential function is isolation. Before the construction of the hospitals, thousands of patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 in Wuhan had to be sent home for isolation. Patients with mild to moderate symptoms are generally more active than the severely ill and thus in greater contact with others, increasing the possibility of transmission and placing family and community members at risk. 39 The Fangcang shelter hospitals isolated COVID-19 patients more effectively from their communities than home isolation.",

            "text": "The second essential function is triage. The Fangcang shelter hospitals inserted an additional level of care into the Chinese health system and thus served a strategic triage function for patients with COVID-19. Patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 who met additional admission criteria (table) 6, 46 were isolated and treated in the Fangcang shelter hospitals, whereas patients with severe to critical COVID-19 received care in traditional hospitals. This strategic triage function released pressure on traditional hospitals, and as a result, the Fangcang shelter hospitals are likely to have boosted both the efficiency and effectiveness of the COVID-19 response in China. The Fangcang shelter hospitals allowed the health system in Wuhan to prioritise those who had severe to critical disease for care in traditional hospitals (about 20% of patients with COVID-19), while ensuring appropriate care for those who experienced mild to moderate disease (about 80% of patients with COVID-19). 16, 33 As a third essential function, Fangcang shelter hospitals provide basic medical care, including antiviral, antipyretic and antibiotic medication; oxygen supplementation and intravenous fluids; and mental health counselling. 6 Two case reports illustrating typical medical histories during a stay at a Fangcang shelter hospital are shown in the panel. To support medical care, a few days after the opening of the first Fangcang shelter hospitals, health workers in Wuhan had access to electronic information systems, supported by cloud platforms and connected with higher-level hospitals, for record keeping, data transfer, and monitoring of quality of care and outcomes. 46 The fourth essential function is frequent monitoring and rapid referral. The Fangcang shelter hospitals in Wuhan were integrated into the overall health systems via simple pathways of referral and transfer. 6 The health workers in the Fangcang shelter hospitals monitored the progression of disease by measuring respiration rate, temperature, oxygen saturation, and blood pressure multiple times per day. 6 For more specialised monitoring, the health workers in the Fangcang shelter hospitals could use imaging and laboratory services, which were available in mobile health units outside the hospitals. If patients met any of the following clinical criteria, they were quickly transferred to designated higher-level hospitals: respiration rate of 30 beats per min or higher; blood oxygen saturation of 93% or higher; partial pressure of oxygen or fraction of inspired oxygen of 300 mm Hg or lower; lung imaging showing a greater than 50% progression of lesions within 24-48 h; or the identification or development of severe chronic diseases, including hyper tension, diabetes, coronary heart disease, cancer, structural lung disease, pulmonary heart disease, or immunosup pression. 6 Health workers also provided a range of specific tests, such as nucleic acid tests and CT scans, to ensure that worsening health status was quickly identified and confirmed in particular cases (panel). 6 As of Feb 29, 2020-the day before the first Fangcang shelter hospital was suspended-the cumulative number of patients who were transferred to higher-level hospitals was 13% of the total patients admitted to the Fangcang shelter hospitals (figure 1). After Feb 29, this percentage increased because all patients who had not been discharged before the Fangcang shelter hospitals closed were routinely referred to higherlevel hospitals. Overall, Fangcang shelter hospitals are likely to have substantially reduced the time from the onset of severe symptoms to admis sion to a higher-level hospital, compared to the alternative of home isolation. 8 discharged patients if they met all of the following criteria: normal body temperature for >3 days, significant improvement of respiratory symp toms, lung imaging showing obvious absorption of inflammation, and negative nucleic acid tests results for COVID-19 at two consecutive times with a sampling interval of at least 1 day. 6 Before discharge from the Fangcang shelter hospitals, patients showered, put on freshly washed clothes, and were sprayed with disinfectant. After discharge, patients spent a further 2 weeks in dedicated quarantine area in Wuhan, such as hotels, before they returned to their homes and families.",

First, the Fangcang shelter hospitals in China were established to isolate the patients who were most likely to transmit the infec tion because they had only mild to moderate COVID-19 and were thus likely to be active in their daily lives and in contact with family and community members. Second, the Fangcang shelter hospitals served an important triage function, separating patients by severity of symptoms, 6,41,42 which was not a focus of previous makeshift and emergency field hospitals. 62, 66 Third, Fangcang shelter hospitals became a national standard of care, rather than a temporary, emergency measure to bridge a gap until improved capacity for mass treatment became available. 6, 41 This standard of care was supported by rigorous quality control and improvement routines, designation of the hospitals as infectious disease zones, and through public health infrastructure standards for air conditioning, ventilation systems, and bathroom facilities. Fourth, the Fangcang shelter hospitals provided more hospital beds within a shorter period of time than previous makeshift and emergency field hospitals. 62 Finally, in contrast to makeshift and emergency field hospitals, Fangcang shelter hospitals were not only health-care facilities, but also served as social spaces, providing essential living, emotional support, and social engagement for the large numbers of patients that lived in isolation from their families and communities. In a sense, Fangcang shelter hospitals served as communities of patients with mild to moderate COVID-19.",

Early descriptive evidence suggests that the Fangcang shelter hospitals were a major reason for the successful COVID-19 control in China. The number of confirmed cases in Wuhan steadily declined from Feb 18, 2020, 12 days after the first Fangcang shelter hospitals started admitting patients. 7 As the number of new infections continued to decline, China suspended all Fangcang shelter hospitals. 34 Future research should estab lish the causal impact of Fangcang shelter hospitals on COVID-19 incidence and population health outcomes.",

By embracing Fangcang shelter hospitals, many countries and communities worldwide could boost their response to the current COVID-19 pandemic as well as future epidemics and disasters.",
