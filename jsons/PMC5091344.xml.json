Since then, multiple other RV panels have been FDA approved (Table 2). These assays are all intended for use with nasopharyngeal (NP) swabs. Clinical laboratories may also validate other specimen types such as bronchoalveolar lavage fluid or nasal washes/aspirates to run off-label. Testing lower respiratory tract specimens is required to confirm whether or not a virus detected in an NP sample is also the cause of lower respiratory tract. Additionally, testing a lower tract specimen may be indicated despite a negative nasal result when the clinical suspicion for viral pneumonia is high.",

Even with fully integrated, closed systems, there is potential to contaminate raw specimens with viruses shed by the respiratory tract of the operator. Laboratories must carefully follow operating procedures designed to minimize the contamination of specimens, work surfaces, and equipment. This can be a major challenge when testing is performed outside of a dedicated molecular diagnostics section. For near patient testing, consideration should be given to manipulating specimens in a biological safety cabinet that can be cleaned and kept separate from positive control material. At a minimum, wearing a mask or face shield should be considered for specimen processing. Laboratories should also monitor positivity rates of the individual targets as a way to quickly detect potential contamination problems.",

Previous RV diagnostic studies have shown that rapid direct fluorescent antibody staining from NP specimens can shorten the length of hospital stay, minimize ancillary testing, and reduce unnecessary antibiotic use for pediatric patients [4, 5]. Is there an advantage to more-sensitive molecular tests that detect a broader spectrum of potential pathogens? An inpatient pediatric cost analysis assessed the price of hospital admission, time in respiratory isolation, antibiotic usage, and diagnostic procedures to conclude that multiplex PCR testing was the least expensive test strategy as long as the prevalence of RV disease was \u226511% [6]. Multiplex panel testing may also be cost-effective for children with influenza-like illness evaluated in the emergency department [7].",

This approach leads to the overuse of antibiotics and has potential for unnecessary drug toxicity. Comprehensive molecular testing for viral and bacterial pathogens from sputum significantly increases the likelihood of making an etiologic diagnosis in community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) [9, 10]. However, currently there are no FDA-approved molecular tests for \u201ctypical\u201d bacterial CAP pathogens. An alternative strategy has been to combine RV multiplex testing with the results of cultures and urine pneumococcal and Legionella antigens. Going forward, combining RV panel results with serum biomarkers [11, 12] and/or measures of host immune response [13] may hold promise for ruling in or out viral infection.",

An important consideration here is that Campylobacter culture is insensitive [21] and the analytic sensitivity of arbitrator PCRs and/or nucleic acid sequencing was poorly defined. It is likely that many of the multiplex Campylobacter DNA detections were true positives given the high specificity of these assays.

With increasing incidence of community-acquired C. difficile infections, the identification of this target in the stool of a symptomatic outpatient may be difficult to interpret [22]. Children <1 year of age can be colonized with toxigenic C. difficile, but clinical disease in this age group is rare [23]. Laboratories that implement GI panel testing with C. difficile toxin A/B targets should consider how positive results will be reported for infants and children. Some laboratories may choose not to release these results or potentially use disclaimers in their reporting.

In the outpatient setting, clinicians should think about what, if any, impact a positive or negative test result will have on patient care, especially when the illness may be self-limited.

Isolation and submission of cultured isolates from ill patients to public health laboratories (PHLs) for typing helps to identify clusters of disease caused by bacterial pathogens such as E. coli 0157, Salmonella, and Listeria. Working with the CDC, the Association of Public Health Laboratories and the American Society for Microbiology have published interim recommendations in the new era of culture-independent tests [33].

First, there were relatively few cases of bacterial or cryptococcal meningitis, which precluded statistically significant assessments of these targets. Previous reports observed that the Cryptococcus targets were less sensitive than antigen testing [34], and the ME panel had a limit of detection on the order of 100 colony-forming units/mL [36]. Next, there were as many false-positive or unconfirmed ME panel results (n = 22) as there were additional confirmed detections (n = 21) made with the comprehensive panel. The authors hypothesized that contamination could have played a role in the false-positive ME panel results, either from the positive control material or from the normal flora of the test operators. The ME test system is closed (ie, the likelihood of amplicon carryover should be low); but like the RV panels, environmental contamination is still possible and laboratories must work diligently to prevent and monitor for this. It is also important to note that study subjects did not necessarily have a high pretest probability for infectious meningoencephalitis, which would have also reduced the pretest probability for disease in some cases. Last, the detection of latent or reactivated Herpesviridae was not uncommon, and the significance of these identifications must be evaluated in the context of the patient.",

These assays have substantially inCreased our ability to detect potential pathogens in a variety of different clinical specimens. Furthermore, moderate-complexity platforms have enabled many more clinical laboratories to perform molecular diagnostic testing in-house, which substantially improves TAT relative to conventional methods. Multiplex molecular capabilities also come with several important caveats. Just because a new test is FDA approved does not necessarily mean it is the right test for all patients. Multiplex reagents and instrumentation is expensive and the pretest probability for infection differs significantly according to patient age, host immunocompetence, time of year, and geographic region. In the absence of cost-effectiveness data, we recommend the following targeted approach to panel testing:\nRV panels have the highest potential impact for immunocompromised patients, critically ill patients, and hospitalized children.GI panels should primarily be used in cases of dysentery, for moderate or severe disease, for symptoms lasting more than a week [37], and for the immunocompromised host with community-onset symptoms.The ME panel targets pathogens that are the most problematic for immunocompromised patients. Testing may also speed time to diagnosis when the clinical suspicion for bacterial meningitis is high or when the patient has already received antibiotics. Outside of these selected scenarios, laboratory consultation with acceptance criteria based in part on elevated CSF cell counts should be considered for immunocompetent adults as a way to limit unnecessary testing [38].",

However, prospective studies may not be feasible due to prohibitive costs or time required to accrue enough patients with a rare disease (eg, meningoencephalitis).
