During the 1998 OSHA hearings, the International Chemical Workers Union suggested that a change of 5% in body weight or 20 lb should be regarded as an obvious change in body weight requiring a repeated respirator fit test.[2] Only one study was found in a literature search on the relationship of weight change and respirator fit.

Large variability was observed with different respirator samples for the same model, between subjects (inter) and within each subject (intra). Although variability was observed between subjects and respirator samples for each model, adequate fit was maintained for all ten subjects and three visits. Following the pilot study, a three-year large scale study was conducted to examine the relationship between frequency of fit testing and changes in N95 filtering-facepiece respirator (FFR) fit and facial dimensions, the results of which are described in this article.",

Inward leakage (IL) consists of particle leakage through two pathways: respirator filter (filter penetration) and the interface between the respirator and a wearer's face (faceseal leakage). A method for evaluating respirator fit by first determining IL by means of a test subject fit test was validated in a previous pilot study[7] and those methods were used for the current study. A PortaCount\u00ae Plus (Model: 8020A, TSI, Inc., Shoreview, MN) condensation particle counter (without the N95-Companion accessory) was used to measure IL of ambient particles ranging from 0.02 to > 1 \u00b5m.[10] The PortaCount\u00ae Plus without N95-Companion counts a larger size range of particles (as compared to using the N95-Companion) and increases the calculated maximum fit factor value to > 10,000. Using the PortaCount Plus alone was also shown in a previous study to have a smaller combined error (alpha, beta, and assignment error) than the PortaCount\u00ae Plus with N95 Companion.[11] Based on results of a pilot study assessing changes in respirator fit over a four-week period, it was determined that this fit test method can adequately measure various variance components to allow accurate comparison of fit between visits.[7]",

Each subject visit required nine fit tests (3 samples \u00d7 3 donnings each), totaling approximately 40 min of fit testing. Subjects were prompted to conduct each exercise of a fit test by visual cues from a laptop computer running FitPlus for Windows (software developed by TSI, Inc. for fit test data collection).

The PortaCount Plus was used alone without N95-Companion to first measure IL on the test subject and later to measure filter penetration of the FFR sealed to a plate. This method differs from the OSHA ambient aerosol condensation nuclei counter (CNC) quantitative fit test protocol (CFR 1910.134) for fit testing in which fit factors are calculated directly from a person's fit using the PortaCount. Thus, fit factors measured in this study using the methods described may not be representative of those measured with this OSHA protocol.",

This flow rate was selected to represent the minute volume of a person while seated and may not have been representative of each subject's breathing pattern. Additionally, three of the OSHA fit test exercises were omitted from this study's fit test protocol: talking, grimace, and bending in place. The FFs obtained in this study may not represent FFs obtained using the full set of eight exercises in the OSHA protocol.",

In this study different periods of times between fit tests were simulated. The key finding from this study is that as the simulated time between fit tests increased, so did the risk of unacceptable fit. If fit testing is conducted annually, the percent of subjects with unacceptable fit was 10.4%. If fit testing were performed only at the 2-year interval, the percent of subjects at risk for unacceptable fit is 19.7%. If fit testing is performed only at the 3-year interval, the percent of subjects at risk for unacceptable fit increased to 25.4%. The predicted risk of unacceptable fit provided an estimate of the OSHA annual fit test failure rate and an estimate of percent of workers who may benefit from annual fit testing. Weight analysis of the combined data from Visits 2\u20137 showed that of the subjects who lost \u2265 20 lb, 24% had unacceptable fit. Therefore, the study results support the OSHA requirement for annual fit testing and additional fit testing guidance based on weight gain or loss. For countries in which fit testing is required every two years, that requirement may need to be changed to an annual fit test requirement. In the future, additional data analyses will be performed to understand the potential effects of other factors such as facial changes and respirator head strap length on fit change. Other factors which may influence respirator fit such as changes in face shape and dimensions (measured using both traditional and 3D measurement techniques) will be explored.",
