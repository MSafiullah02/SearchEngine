            "text": "Summary The successful conservation and restoration of the temperate native grasslands of south-eastern Australia is critical to reversing the decline in range and diversity of these threatened plant communities. Yet the goals of high native species diversity and weed management are difficult to achieve in grassland restoration projects. To increase our understanding of whether synergies exist between these goals (i.e. whether early introduction of a larger number of species might improve both outcomes in the reassembly of native grassland), we examined the relationships between plant species number, functional group number and resource use during the establishment phase of direct-sown grassland. We did this by sowing a representative suite of species (at varying levels of species number and functional group number) into experimental plots and then measuring and analysing the extent to which the newly established assemblages captured available resources, i.e. used soil nitrate, absorbed light and produced biomass (vegetative cover). Statistically significant correlations were common between the predictor variables (species number, functional group number, percentage vegetative cover, plant number, presence of idiosyncratic (dominating) species) and responses (soil nitrate concentration, light reduction or 'extinction'). Higher diversity was associated with lower soil nitrate, while percentage vegetative cover and the presence of idiosyncratic species best predicted light extinction. The relationship between diversity, and plant biomass (measured as vegetative cover) and plant number was positive in the first year of the study. The diversity/biomass relationship became negative in the second year due to the higher numbers and cover of 'idiosyncratic' species. The diversity/plant number relationship also became negative in the autumn of the second year and was reduced to a trend by the winter. We found that lower nitrate and increasing plant numbers and vegetative cover were most strongly linked to increasing species number in the early stages of this study. This suggests that introducing and maintaining high diversity early in a native grassland reassembly or enhancement project will improve the resistance (e.g. to weed) of these communities. At later stages of grassland development, this function may be provided by the more dominating idiosyncratic species. The maintenance of diversity, an important goal in its own right, will therefore necessitate managed disturbances to periodically reduce the vegetative dominance of idiosyncratic species, releasing resources for the diverse range of other species whose early introduction will have allowed them to persist in the soil seed bank or as suppressed rootstocks.",

The particular form and degree of contribution varies significantly from species to species and from individual to individual. Biotic contributions are, in turn, influenced by stochastic abiotic factors such as fluctuations in temperature, rainfall or soil fertility, which impact on individuals and communities at differing local and regional scales (Fridley 2001) . The summed contribution of individuals and species has led many ecologists to hypothesize that the maintenance of community function is intimately linked to the level of diversity within a community (Tilman et al. 1996; Fridley 2001) .

On 5 May 2002, each 1-m 2 plot was sown with various combinations of species containing 1, 3, 7, 9 or 21 species, representing various levels of species and functional group diversity (Gibson-Roy et al. 2007b) . Each plot was sown with 300 seeds, divided equally between the species allocated to that replicate. Therefore, the numbers of seeds sown varied between species, depending on the number of species in a treatment and the number of times a given species was randomly allocated to treatments. A detailed description of sowing and maintenance procedures was reported by Gibson-Roy et al. (2007b) .",

In general, these low nitrate levels are indicative of those in undisturbed or slightly disturbed grassy woodland (<5 mg/kg), whereas >50 mg kg is typical of weed dominated 'stock camp' sites. Nitrate levels where highest in our study in spring (18.7 mg/kg) and progressively declined to 3.5 mg/kg in autumn, not dissimilar to those found in Prober et al. (2005) after the additions of sugar. The levels began to rise again in late winter when such increases would be expected. In spring and summer, when natural peaks seem to occur and when weed vulnerability in an establishing grassland is at its highest, the strength of the relationship between species number and lowered nitrate levels was at its greatest. Therefore, knowing that direct-sown grasslands are particularly vulnerable to competition from weeds (both in-situ and invading propagules), this suggests that restoration strategies might consider the early introduction of high diversity to increase the competitiveness (resource use and biomass accumulation) of the developing communities.",

Complementary structural, phenological and physiological characteristics of plants in diverse communities can enhance the use of light in both space and time (Anten & Hirose 1999; Aan et al. 2006) . Light levels beneath plant canopies are linked most strongly to plant productivity and asymmetry, rather than species diversity (Foster & Gross 1998; Rajaniemi 2003; Harpole & Tilman 2007 ). Therefore, a key question in this study was: is diversity a driver of light extinction in these assembled communities, or is it better predicted by levels of vegetation cover or species-specific traits? In our heterogeneously structured communities, plant cover most reduced the level of light reaching plot surfaces. The number of species on plots did not sig-nificantly influence the relationship at any time during the study. However, we found that functional group number contributed to this relationship in the final winter (2003) . The functional groups used in this study were an expansion of those commonly used in grassland studies (i.e. grass, forb, legumes) (e.g. Spehn et al. 2000; Polley et al. 2003) . In newly sown communities, it is probable that it takes some time for these differences to significantly influence light extinction. Indeed, it is questionable how long lasting these particular functional group effects are likely to be and the extent to which they will diminish as a single functional group (tussock grasses) establishes dominance.",

Their vegetative dominance over and above the species pool was through tall, vertically orientated tussocks, upright and spreading canopies, or low, lateral growth (Table 4) . Lunt (1991) and Morgan (2001) identified the capacity of Kangaroo Grass to dominate light relations in many Australian temperate grassland communities through biomass dominance. Factors such as fire, grazing and resource limitations reduce the dominance of such idiosyncratics from time to time, temporally releasing sub-dominant species from competition. Also, light transmittance to the ground surface is thought to be critical in these communities to enhance opportunities for seedling survival (Willis & Groves 1991) .",

However, this relationship later reversed and, 18 months after sowing, a negative trend was evident with idiosyncratic species and plant number the strongest predictors of vegetation cover. This pattern is common in mature south-eastern temperate grasslands of Australia. In the absence of disturbance, the accumulation of biomass from dominant grass species leads to canopy closure and eventual reductions in species diversity (Lunt 1991; Morgan 2001) .",

These observations suggest that, through a combination of rapid niche utilization and increased resource use efficiency, diverse communities may be quicker to consolidate and therefore less vulnerable to invasion by non-target species. As the sown communities began to mature, we found that diversity declined with increasing vegetative cover. This does not reduce resistance to invasion by non-target species while the dominant species responsible for vegetative cover persist. It does, however, indicate that managers must find ways to maintain diversity over time. In particular, our research confirms the findings of others (e.g. Lunt & Morgan 1999 ) that restoration practitioners should consider the ongoing management of native species that demonstrate a potential to dominate vegetatively. This is especially relevant in mature grasslands where, under favourable rainfall conditions, grass dominants can quickly accumulate biomass to levels that swamp sub-dominant species. Management strategies would include the application of appropriate disturbance regimes such as burning, periodic grazing or mowing, which release resources to the diverse mix of initially sown species. We can reliably predict that these species are capable of re-sprouting and/or germinating in response to the disturbance.",

A recognition by restorationists, land managers and perhaps, most importantly, by policy-makers, of the importance of species and functional diversity to community processes, tempered by an understanding that other factors also influence the development of plant communities, will enhance capacity to more effectively preserve and restore these highly threatened communities.",
