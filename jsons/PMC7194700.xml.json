            "text": "Wuhan, China has attracted widespread attention due to an outbreak caused by novel coronavirus [1]. This outbreak has revived the memory of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which caused 806 deaths all over the world [2]. Chinese authorities has shuttled down many cities near epicentre of Hubei (Wuhan). This marks the very first time in China to retaliate in such a way against any outbreak [3]. Under the government policies on COVID-19, universities of China especially in Wuhan region issued strict rules for the foreign students to prevent the transmission of virus in university community. Due to this situation a panic condition has produced in the students especially those who were living in epicentre. Our aim of study was to explore that panic and influencing factors on such students. For this purpose, a cross sectional study was developed by using a questionnaire. Questionnaire was filled out independently from the participants of several places in Hubei especially in Wuhan. We approached students through official WeChat groups, which were already developed by the universities for international students. We collected 504 valid responses from international students in which male and female respondents were 288 (57.1%), and 216 (42.9%) respectively. Of which 368 (73%) were married and 136 (27%) were single with 30 years (SD = 9.26) average age (Fig. 1\na).",

First, those who had been in China for less than three years suffered 2.19 times more than the students who had been here for one or two years. Married people were 13.05 times more effected than the single people. Similarly, the students who were doing bachelor and PhD were more likely to be affected (Odd Ratio = 0.66) than the master students. Also the students who were between the age of 18\u201324 years were more likely to be affected than >25 years old students.",

They reduced contact with others (78.96%), decreased visits to the affected areas (71.03%), increased the frequency of washing hands (95.83%), and took more care of their room ventilation (88.88%). While attending public places also declined (94.84%) (Fig. 1d). In another two specific questions about to stay in China and the policies by Chinese government, 92.85% students were satisfied with the steps took by government and 58.53% preferred to stay here in China rather than to go their home countries.",
