This paper builds an index of policy effectiveness on fighting COVID-19 pandemic, whose building method is similar to the index of Policy Uncertainty, based on province-level paper documents released in China from Jan.1st to Apr.16th of 2020. This paper also studies the relationships among COVID-19 daily confirmed cases, stock market volatility, and document-based policy effectiveness in China. This paper uses the DCC-GARCH model to fit conditional covariance's change rule of multi-series. This paper finally tests four hypotheses, about the time-space difference of policy effectiveness and its overflow effect both on the COVID-19 pandemic and stock market. Through the inner interaction of this triad structure, we can bring forward more specific and scientific suggestions to maintain stability in the stock market at such exceptional times.",

Hainan Province is located at the southern tip of China. When the pandemic first broke out in Hubei, the central government published an official document in response, and the Hainan provincial government remained in a wait-and-see state during the first 7 days. However, as the pandemic intensified, public policy was transmitted from central to local, so seven days later, the government published a similar policy in response to the central order. Thus, the curve of Hainan Province clearly shows the time lag of paper documents between the central and local. When the k-lag co-correlation graph of a specific province has more significant volatility in the right part, there may a rule that the volatility of the specific province follows Central's with a lag.",

Different regions in China seems to respond to COVID-19 in absolutely different manners. As can be seen in Figure 4V -B2, six figures represent the volatility of the Policy Effectiveness Index of central, Hubei, North, South, East, and west regions of China. The speed of publishing documents and the administrative power will affect the volatility. Based on this cause, Hubei as the first outbreak of the pandemic in China, the volatility fluctuated most violently. For example, in March, Hubei entered the most stringent control of the pandemic period, and the government took maximum efforts to combat the COVID-19. This moment relatively presented as the peak on the curve. From a geographical perspective, the south region is closest to Hubei, and with convenient transportation bringing large population movements, the South region has a faster and stronger rate of publication of paper documents than other regions.

In this part, we want to figure out how COVID-19, Policy Effectiveness, and Stock Emotion react to each other, from the perspective of volatility, by DCC-GARCH. First we apply a AR(1) on each series and then we fit a simple DCC-GARCH which only takes 1-lag information into consideration. The estimate and t-test of our model are shown in Table 5V . Each series contributes to volatility prediction and the joint part gives us a direct estimate of overflow effects. From the significant coefficients, it can be seen that the issuance of central documents is often not influenced by historical documents, but rather tends to take into account external factors such as the previous national situation and the development of the pandemic, while the pandemic has evolved as a cumulative result of historical circumstances in addition to other external factors. As for the stocks, it's condition and features are similar to the epidemic. The historical external factors of the triad are significant in the overflow effects of the triad interaction. ",

As seen in Figure 5V -B4, in February, the average of central-COVID-covariance is negative, this suggests that, in February of the outbreak, the volatility of the policy effectiveness index is more stable, which means the control power with the pandemic is weak. Lack of timely and effective communication policies directly affect the next stage of the pandemicas we can see in Figure 2V -A, the COVID-29 achieved to the peak. Lessons learned, as the paperwork followed the development situation of epidemic, volatility covariance reverted to nearly zero. This explains the interaction between the epidemic and official effectiveness visually. The overflow effects of paper documents and the stock market are the opposite. Also in February, the centralstock-covariance is positive. This means that the stronger the paper document, the more volatile the stock market, that is, the paper document stimulates the stock market. This may be due to the government's publication of more economic policies related to releasing liquidity in the financial markets and supporting returning to work.",
