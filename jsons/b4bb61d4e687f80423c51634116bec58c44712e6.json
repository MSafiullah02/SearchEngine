For example, after three cycle H2O2 vaporous 17 sterilizations, the most penetrating particle size for the N95 level respirators was from 18 250 nm -500 nm, which carried the peak concentration of the SARS-CoV-2 in 19 hospitals. The Size Specific Filtration Efficiency (250 nm -500 nm) dropped to 20 56%\u00b14%, however, the Overall Filtration Efficiency was still 86%\u00b15%.

The actual SARS-CoV-2 size ranges from 60 nm -31 150 nm (3,4,5). The peak concentration of the SARS-CoV-2 in hospitals was found in 250 32 nm -500 nm particles (6). Due to the COVID-19 pandemic and shortage of mask supplies 33 (7), some studies analyzed the reuse of N95/KN95 masks after sterilization by measuring the 34 filtration efficiency using sodium chloride (NaCl) test aerosol (8, 9) . The N95 grade mask 35 should have a minimum filtration efficiency of 95% for 300 nm NaCl aerosols. The light-36 scattering instruments (e.g., aerosol photometer), which are commonly used for filtration 37 efficiency test, are usually limited to measuring aerosol size from 100 nm to 10 \u00b5m.",
