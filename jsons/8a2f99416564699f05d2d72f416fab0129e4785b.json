Treatment with ACEIs or ARBs was not associated with higher serum ACE2 levels ( Figure 1) . In fact, we observed a weak trend of lower ACE2 levels in individuals on ARBs treatment (\uf062 = -0.0222, P = 0.043) while ACEIs showed no effect on ACE2 (\uf062 = -0.0003, P = 0.976). The increase observed in ACE levels with ACEIs treatment (\uf062 = 0.2899, P < 0.001) is consistent with available data showing positive effect of ACEIs use on ACE mRNA levels and activity 10 . In contrast, treatment with ARBs had no effect on ACE levels (\uf062 = -0.0005, P = 0.699). As was expected, serum renin levels were elevated in response to both ACEIs (\uf062 = 0.4994, P < 0.001) and ARBs (\uf062 = 0.5243, P < 0.001) treatment, as these medications diminish the negative feedback regulation of angiotensin II on renal secretion 11 .

For instance, it is possible that the effect of ACEIs and ARBs on ACE2 levels in pulmonary tissues manifests differently from what was observed in serum. Moreover, just how the balance between the levels of soluble ACE2 and its membrane-bound receptor counterpart is maintained, has still to be fully defined. However, our results using a large population study with many on ACEIs and ARBs treatment agree well with a study showing genetic proxies for ACE inhibition having no effect on ACE2 levels in pulmonary tissues and in plasma 14 , as well as a recent report on a lack of association between ACEIs/ARBs use and severity of outcomes in COVID-19 among 115 hospitalized male patients 15 . The accumulated data do not back the notion that the use of the antihypertensive medications ACEIs and ARBs results in elevation of ACE2, that in turn could lead to increased susceptibility to severe outcome in COVID-19. Importantly, these results do not support the proposed routine discontinuation of ACEIs or ARBs among patients affected with COVID-19.",
