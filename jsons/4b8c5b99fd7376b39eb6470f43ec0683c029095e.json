In addition, the identification of best practices offers a way to identify why particular risk messages may have more influence than others on how audiences respond. Adding to the complexity of the situation for risk communicators are multiple publics who may not share the same understanding or willingness to respond to the messages due to how the risk or potential crisis may affect them in what we described as spheres of ethnocentricity.",

The case study approach to research in the social sciences is a fitting method for identifying the interaction between individuals, messages, and context. Yin (2003) summarizes, \"The case study method allows investigators to retain the holistic and meaningful characteristics of real-life events\" (p. 2). The case study approach works well to identify best practices for risk communication because individual situations are defined or isolated, relevant data are collected about the situation, and the findings are presented in such a way that a more complete understanding is reached regarding how messages shape perceptions and serve to prompt particular responses from those hearing the messages.",

Therefore, in the construction of the case studies presented in this book, a consistent methodological approach was followed. In order to establish common areas of analysis within the research design, we focused on risk situations involving the unintentional or intentional contamination or compromise of the food system. A conceptual framework based upon the best practices explained in Chapter 2 and a chronological exposition of the pre-crisis, crisis, and post-crisis messages created consistency as we drew implications about what happened, how it happened, and why. Collectively, the cases allowed us to generalize about the best practices as a whole. T. L. Sellnow et al. Effective Risk Communication 53",

In some cases, preemptive communication strategies designed to promote compliant behavior are found. In others, the exposition of the crisis revealed how risks were not anticipated or communicated effectively to the public. In fact, as demonstrated by how a crisis actually unfolded, the evidence suggests that those managing the crisis were not always mindfully considering the competing arguments. Rather than seeking congruence, reliance on economic or social models enabled decision-makers to simplify the risk situation at a time when complexity should have been acknowledged. In such situations, the value of the best practices may not have been recognized until after the crisis had passed.",

Sellnow and Littlefield (2005) use case studies describing both accidental and intentional contamination to demonstrate lessons learned about protecting America's food supply. Three cases focused on particular companies and their experiences managing a crisis: Schwan's demonstration of social responsibility in response to a Salmonella contamination crisis, Chi-Chi's inability to survive a Hepatitis A outbreak despite apologia, and Jack in the Box restaurants' organizational learning following an E. coli outbreak in Seattle, Washington. A case involving interagency coordination and the tainted strawberries in the National School Lunch Program revealed how various stakeholders affect crisis planning efforts.

Multiple sources may include textual materials, on-line websites and resources, interviews, media accounts, and personal observations. Due to the nature of the case study approach, choices must be made about the kinds of information to be utilized. Accessibility often dictates the kinds of information to be included, in which case the researchers must continually cross reference to be sure that the most accurate depiction of the situation is conveyed. For the case studies included within this volume, text-based materials provided the majority of the information consulted ( Fig. 4 .1). Information drawn from national newspapers (e.g., New York Times and The Wall Street Journal), regional newspapers (e.g., The Boston Globe) or-as in the New Zealand foot and mouth hoax case-international outlets (e.g., Financial Times and The Dominion Post) provided contextual material enabling the researcher to establish the time frame and variables at work in each case. Websites and on-line materials, such as those offered by governmental and industrial groups provided insight from the perspective of those in positions to respond to the risk or crisis situation. A number of groups were accessed through such websites, including the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the Department for the Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs, Odwalla, Inc., KidSource Online, and ConAgra Foods.

As such, the introduction of a theoretical framework provides an overlay for the data that the researcher may use as a way to explore, describe, or explain what happened.

Account for the uncertainty inherent in risk. Risk communicators must acknowledge and reinforce the unknown as an argument when framing messages for the public. 4. Design risk messages to be culture-centered. To achieve the desired response, risk communicators must work with diverse publics to develop messages that are meaningful and efficacious. 5. Acknowledge diverse levels of risk tolerance. Due to widely varying capacities to process risk messages due to perceptions of hazard and outrage, communicators must recognize complexity and capacity when constructing risk messages. 6. Involve the public in dialogue about risk. The public's right to know about potential risks, and their role as participants in finding interacting arguments may prompt less hazard and outrage. 7. Present risk messages with honesty. Inherent in the process of finding congruence is the recognition that arguments are presented truthfully and completely. 8.

In this closed environment, researchers can make generalizations based upon the sophistication of their design. However, situations where risk messages are communicated through the media and events are reported and presented as they unfold, researchers have less control over how competing risk message are transmitted and received by diverse groups within the public. The range of variables that cannot be controlled or manipulated further complicates the coverage of contemporary events outside of the laboratory. For example, Chapter 8 examines the case of in the tainted Odwalla juice, the Cryptosporidium outbreak case, or in the case of finding Salmonella in ConAgra Foods pot pies, human error could not have been predicted with certainty. In disasters like Hurricane Katrina, elements of nature could not be controlled. They happened.

With this in mind, we selected crisis situations where the presence or absence of best practices for risk communication could be identified, providing the readers with insight into how risk communication may or could have been used to affect the behavior of various stakeholders prior to the onset of a crisis situation. Each case study is unique in the risks posed, as well as how the communication agent sought to affect compliant behavior from the various stakeholders receiving the risk messages.",

At the time of the crisis, Milwaukee had no water monitoring systems in place and the outbreak served as a wake-up call by exposing weaknesses in the public health system and pointing out the bioterrorism risks. Throughout the crisis, community leaders failed to be open, honest, and timely with the information they provided to the public. They failed to be mindful of public concerns expressed prior to the cryptosporidium outbreak. In addition, they did not collaborate or coordinate across agencies, exacerbating the crisis. Milwaukee was unprepared but learned from the event, established a plan should such a crisis occur in the future, and now has one of the safest water treatment systems in the country.",

While local crisis managers had a plan, its usefulness was mitigated by the length and format of the document. Once the hurricane struck, New Orleans crisis managers faced the difficult challenge of collaborating and coordinating resource distribution to affected residents. Another difficulty was getting information to the stakeholders. In the pre-crisis and crisis stages, the media were often ahead of local officials in presenting information to residents. This compromised the local officials' credibility and accountability. Clearly, lack of pre-event planning, the absence of collaboration and coordination, and the need for honest, candid, open, and accountable communication are key reasons why local crisis managers were unable to plan for, manage, and move past what was a devastating event for New Orleans and the surrounding region.",

In New Zealand, after receiving a threat claiming a deliberate release of the foot and mouth disease virus on Waiheke Island, the government had to provide intersecting messages demonstrating their capacity to manage the crisis situation. In essence, they claimed to be treating the situation as a potential crisis, while at the same time indicating their belief that the threat was a hoax. Managing crisis uncertainty became the focus for local leaders as they presented messages minimizing the risk as a hoax while acknowledging their treatment of the message as a viable threat to the security of the cattle and the New Zealand economy. The pre-crisis partnerships established between crisis managers and the various stakeholders proved valuable as the agencies worked together to disseminate information and communicate with the local citizens, as well as New Zealand's international partners. While a crisis plan was in place, and had been tested, there were some initial concerns raised by the local public that were ultimately mitigated due to open communication, as well as an attitude of compassion and empathy demonstrated by crisis spokespeople. While the hoax never developed into a crisis, providing messages of self-efficacy about checking for symptoms became an effective way to garner public confidence.",

Odwalla met the needs of the media and remained accessible by holding press conferences, continually updating a website, instituting a hotline, and maintaining open communication with consumers and the press. The company delivered messages of self-efficacy and offered multiple ways for consumers to remain safe. In addition, company leaders apologized publicly, acknowledged the tragedy of the situation, paid medical bills for victims, and acknowledged the impact of the crisis on the image of the company. Following the crisis, Odwalla created an advisory council that ultimately recommended a new pasteurization process, breaking new ground in the industry. The use of some of the best practices enabled Odwalla to embrace a crisis, use it as an opportunity to become an industry leader, initiate industry wide change, and to encourage organizational renewal.",

In the process of what appeared to be a demonstration of more concerned about their bottom line than with the safety of their customers, ConAgra initially shifted the blame for the outbreak to consumers for not cooking the pot pies properly. In addition, ConAgra made overly-assuring statements to the public about which products were affected by Salmonella (chicken and turkey), and which were not (beef). The assumptions made by ConAgra Foods about the literacy levels, economic status, access to media, proximity to outbreak, and cultural group identities of those receiving the risk messages also complicated their communication with stakeholders. In this case, once Salmonella was linked to ConAgra Foods' pot pies, the company issued a recall of all brands associated with their product. While additional information about the ConAgra Foods recall has yet to emerge, the case points to the need for greater attention by company spokespeople to the best practices of risk communication in order to preserve a positive reputation with the public.",

In all of the cases, risk communicators should have acknowledged competing arguments in the construction of risk messages. For example, the Cryptosporidium case demonstrates the need to infuse risk communication into policy making. By accepting that current practices would take care of the problem, local leaders allowed the crisis to develop. In the Hurricane Katrina case, the dynamic state of affairs required communicators to continuously review the situation and be proactive in communicating strategies of self-efficacy. Regarding the New Zealand potential foot and mouth disease case, a clear argument exists for why risk communicators must acknowledge and reinforce the unknown when framing messages for the public. Similarly, the collaboration and coordination among agencies with credible information sources helped the New Zealand crisis leaders build support among the various stakeholders affected by the potential contamination. As for Odwalla, the company was forced to acknowledge diverse levels of risk tolerance as the complexity of the situation unfolded. Similarly, a recognition of the need for a culturecentered approach would have enhanced the communication of ConAgra Foods with consumers and demonstrated a commitment to safety over profit. The following five chapters serve as examples of case studies involving risk communication.",
