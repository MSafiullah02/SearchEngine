A number of countries including the U.K., Germany, the U.S. and mainland China began rolling out A/H1N1 vaccination programs from October to December 2009 [9], [10], [11], [12], [13]. The Hong Kong government purchased 3 million shots of A/H1N1 vaccines for several high risk groups (health care workers, pregnant women, people of age >65 years old and children of 6 months to 6 years old and others with some health conditions) and for 500,000 people in the general population, who would voluntarily pay for the vaccination. The local vaccination plan was launched on December 21, 2009.",

In that study, factors associated with the willingness included past history of seasonal influenza vaccination and perceived risk of contracting influenza A/H1N1 [14]. Another recent study reported that the prevalence of intention to take up A/H1N1 vaccine in the Hong Kong general population would be price sensitive [15].

Factors in association with seasonal influenza vaccination have been widely reported. The Health Belief Model (HBM) postulates that constructs such as perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, perceived benefits, perceived barriers, cue to action and self-efficacy are determinants of health behaviors [24], [25], [26]; these constructs were significantly associated with seasonal influenza vaccination in the general population [27]. The Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) specifies that positive and negative attitudes, subjective norms and perceived behavioral control of the health-related behavior are key determinants of behavioral intention and hence the actual health-related behavior [28], [29]. Such constructs were also associated with seasonal influenza vaccination [30]. Factors related to emerging respiratory infectious diseases such as avian influenza are important determinants of seasonal influenza vaccination [31]. It is shown that severity of the influenza A/H1N1 pandemic [17], [18] and history of seasonal influenza vaccination [32] were associated with acceptance of A/H1N1 vaccine. There are only a few studies investigating factors in association with intention to take up the A/H1N1 vaccination.",

Random telephone numbers were selected from up-to-date telephone directories. Over 95% of the households in Hong Kong have a fixed-line telephone installed [40]. Interviews were conducted from 6:30 pm to 10 pm to avoid over-representation of non-working people. The eligible member whose birthday was closest to the survey date was selected from each of the contacted households. Verbal consent was obtained from the respondents and the interview lasted for about 20 min. At least three phone calls were made at different hours and weekdays before a non-contact telephone number was considered invalid. The study was granted ethics approval by the Chinese University of Hong Kong. A total of 378 eligible respondents were identified and 301 completed the interview; the response rate was 79.6% (301/378).",

Despite the fact that variables related to perceived severity, perceived susceptibility of seasonal influenza and knowledge and misconceptions about mode of transmission of H5N1 were significantly associated with seasonal influenza vaccination [31], none of the similar variables used in this study that are related to A/H1N1 were significantly associated with the three behavioral intention variables. Cognitions with respect to influenza A/H1N1 are therefore not going to play a significant role in shaping behavioral intention toward A/H1N1 vaccination \u2013 the prevalence of A/H1N1 vaccination is not expected to increase even if the virus becomes more prevalent, severer or if there are changes in the level of knowledge about its mode of transmission. In contrast to our results, two recent studies suggested that perceived severity of the A/H1N1 pandemic was associated with the intention to take up the vaccine [17], [18]. Cultural differences therefore exist.",
