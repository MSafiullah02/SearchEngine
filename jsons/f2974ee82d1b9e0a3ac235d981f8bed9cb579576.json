In this case, prevention measures must be applied: appropriate personal protective equipment, fitting out the practice and waiting room, disinfection after every patient. The initiation of a CPAP treatment without having carried out a recording beforehand can be discussed in the event of a significant clinical probability of OSAS with severe symptoms (https://aasm.org/covid-19-resources/covid-19-mitigation-strategies-sleep-clinics-labs). A Request for Treatment form with a motivation letter can be sent to the social security institution. The conduct of the clinical examination before the initiation of treatment of a patient suffering from OSA must be delayed in the absence of severe symptoms. If the treatment must be implemented rapidly, this examination will be conducted with the strengthened protection measures laid out in the recommendations issued by the French Society of Otorhinolaryngology (SFORL) [1] .",

However, the intentional air leaks around the mask and the high positive air flows delivered by the machine may contribute to spreading SARS-CoV-2 in the patient's environment and exposing those close to them. Opinions regarding indications and modalities of CPAP therapy during the current pandemic were not consensual [3, 4] . Therefore, on March, 19, 2020, the French Language Respiratory Society (SPLF) issued national recommendations on this subject (http://splf.fr/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Apnee-du-sommeil-COVID_19-190320.pdf). According to those, CPAP treatment should be limited to severe forms of OSAS in the current context of COVID-19 pandemic. This treatment should be done at home as often as possible through a service provider in compliance with the protective rules. Any patient, even asymptomatic, should be considered as possibly infected with SARS-CoV-2 and contagious. Additionally, even in the rare cases where a patient had a negative PCR testing just before the initiation of CPAP therapy, there is no guarantee that he will not become infected while he or she is still on this treatment. Thus, the same precautions should apply to all patients. Due to the risk of aerosolization, in-laboratory, initiation of CPAP or split-night study are not advised. Explanations for putting on and adjusting the mask can be given while staying at a distance of at least one meter from the patient, or through explanatory videos if necessary.",

The machine must be carefully cleaned to ensure the absence of any live virus and a new tubing and new mask must be used (request these from the service provider). A recent study demonstrated the persistence of the virus on plastic up to 72 hours after its application [5] . In the event of a confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection in a hospitalised patient, CPAP therapy should be discontinued while awaiting the COVID-19 diagnostic test results. If the infection is confirmed, before resuming the treatment, the CPAP mask and tubing should be modified following the recommendations issued by the \"Ventilation and oxygen therapy\" (GAV) task force of SPLF (http://splf.fr/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/LES-PROCEDURES-DU-GAVO2-ProtectionVirale2020-MAJ02avril2020.pdf).

These severe symptoms are excessive daytime sleepiness with significant risks of accident for a patient in a high-risk occupation (professional driver, machine operator, etc\u2026), existence of comorbidities of which OSA threatens to exacerbate the consequences if not treated, particularly in patients with cardiovascular comorbidity (treatment-resistant hypertension, recurrent atrial fibrillation, symptomatic cardiac insufficiency with reduced or maintained left ventricular ejection fraction, highrisk coronary disease, previous cerebrovascular event) or with severe respiratory diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or poorly-controlled asthma. Recording at home is preferred to recording in a hospitalisation or sleep laboratory setting. The preferred option is for the patients to avoid leaving their home for the installation and return of the equipment. If possible, a respiratory polygraph is preferred with regard to polysomnography due to its shorter installation time, limiting the contact between the installer and the patient, and its smaller number of sensors, limiting the risk of contact contamination. Single-use sensors should be used. The handover and installation of the equipment can be carried out in the office, at a time when the patient will be the only person there, or at home by a service provider, while complying with hygiene guidelines. Alternatively, the material can be delivered by post to the patient's home, with an installation carried out by the physician, by his technician or by the patient himself with the help of precise written instructions and the practitioner's assistance, in person or by video.The recording start time must be programmed beforehand, except for the equipment requiring calibration once the sensors are placed on the patient. The patient is advised to wash their hands well when setting up the equipment and putting it on and taking it off. The equipment must be placed in a plastic bag that can be sealed. The patient should wash their hands after handling this bag. The equipment can be returned to the office, at a time when the patient will be the only person there or can be sent by post. Alternatively, it can be collected by a service provider, at the patient's home, while complying with hygiene guidelines. The cleaning of the equipment with the guidelines issued by the health services. According to the American Association of Sleep Medicine, it is recommended that this equipment not be reused until 72 hours after disinfection (https://aasm.org/covid-19-resources/covid-19-mitigation-strategiessleep-clinics-labs). These arrangements may change if the polygraph manufacturers can ensure the polygraph's safety for reuse within a shorter timeframe and present an appropriate disinfection protocol.",

A solution using a thermoformable devices handled only by the patient may be suggested as an alternative during to reduce the risks of viral transmission. The monitoring of devices already in place can be done by teleconsultation. Additional titration may be performed in the medical practice without getting too close to the patient's face and mouth and while complying with the appropriate hygiene measures, or by the patient themselves under professional supervision via telemedicine.The place of surgery in the treatment of OSAS depends on the procedure suggested. It is recommended to postpone nasal surgery procedures (septoplasty, septorhinoplasty) as well as palatopharyngoplasties. SFORL recommends tonsillectomies in the event of OSAS with a Friedman score of I (Mallampati score 1 or 2, tonsil size grade 4 or 3), without prior endoscopy and without any special technical adaptation[2]. Regarding postoperative monitoring, it is recommended to monitor the patients for one night in an intermediate care unit (IMCU). The majority of IMCU have been requisitioned for treating COVID-19+ patients. Any surgery must comply with the hygiene and",
