            "text": "The proof of principle that antibodies could be efficiently expressed and targeted to different intracellular compartments in mammalian cells dates to 1990 (Biocca et al. 1990) and led to the concept of exploiting recombinant antibodies to block or modulate the function of target antigens for intercellular and intracellular immunization (Biocca and Cattaneo 1995; Cattaneo and Biocca 1997). Intrabodies have unique advantages comparing to other knockout gene techniques or RNA interference. First, they can target the antigen in different intracellular compartments including extracellular milieu. Secondly, they are highly specific reagents and are very stable in mammalian cells, especially when expressed in the secretory compartment. In addition, intrabodies can hit a variety of possible targets: (i) specific protein domains, (ii) specific protein-protein interaction sites, (iii) post-translational modifications, (iv) multiple conformational isoforms (oligomers, fibrils etc) and (v) even non protein antigens.",

Recombinant antibody domains, in particular single-chain Fv (scFv) fragments have been expressed in the cytoplasm (Biocca et al. 1994), the nucleus (Duan et al. 1994; Mhashilkar et al. 1995) and the secretory pathway of mammalian cells (Marasco et al. 1993) and successfully used to inhibit the function of several intracellular antigens. New suitable antibody formats for their intracellular use are now available and functional intrabodies are employed as research tools to define the mechanisms of human pathologies at the molecular level and for a variety of therapeutic applications. For instance, intrabodies have been designed to inhibit single or simultaneously multiple signal transduction pathways (Lener et al. 2000; Tanaka et al. 2007; Jendreyko et al. 2005), inhibition of HIV viral proteins (Lo et al. 2008), inhibition of oncogene products (Williams and Zhu 2006; Griffin et al. 2006), misfolding-prone proteins (Cardinale and Biocca 2008a), receptors of the immune system (Kirschning et al. 2010) and also applied in post-transplantation surgery (Zdoroveac et al. 2008).",

Intrabodies in the ER behave as intracellular anchors and can be used either to prevent the appearance of receptor proteins on the plasma membrane or to inhibit the secretion of a protein. Similar protein retention in the trans-Golgi has been achieved with a trans-Golgi retention signal (Zhou et al. 1998). Targeting to the plasma membrane has been obtained by fusing a scFv with a receptor transmembrane domain (Chesnut et al. 1996).",

Nuclear targeting can be achieved by adding one or more nuclear localisation sequences (NLS) to the leader-less antibody fragments, such as the PKKKRKV sequence of the large T antigen of SV40, either at the N- and C-terminus (Biocca et al. 1995). Intrabodies have been also targeted to mitochondria. N-terminal presequences are present in most of the nuclear-encoded mitochondrial proteins. These sequences are removed once the protein is translocated through the mitochondrial membrane. The N-terminal presequence of the subunit VIII of human cytochrome oxidase (COX8.21), covering the cleavage junction, can be fused to the scFv fragment. The resulting molecule correctly localizes to mitochondria (Biocca et al. 1995).",

All the scFvexpress plasmids contain an N- or C-terminal localisation signal that allows the targeting of the antibody fragments to different compartments, including the endoplasmic reticulum (scFvex-ER), the cytoplasm (scFvex-cyt), the nucleus (scFvex-nuc) and the mitochondria (scFvex-mit). The scFvexpress-cyt has no targeting signal (leader-less) and directs the expression of scFv in the cytoplasm, with an N-terminal methionine instead of the leader sequence for secretion. All other targeting vectors are derivatives of the scFvexpress-cyt and were obtained by the insertion of well characterized targeting signals (Biocca et al. 1995) either N- or C-terminal to the scFv, as appropriate.",

Other formats that have been successfully expressed inside cells are recombinant bispecific and tetravalent antibody fragments made of two scFvs linked through the second and third heavy chain constant domain, named intradiabodies.

They are easily produced as recombinant antibodies, much smaller in size and can be forged into new multispecific and multivalent reagents with enhanced therapeutic efficacy.

Thus, a major issue raised in the initial phase of work on intrabodies was the limited half life of antibody and antibody domains and their tendency to aggregate when expressed in the cytoplasm of mammalian cells. Studies on targeting of scFv fragments showed, in fact, that the expression levels of the retargeted antibody domains may vary and the cytoplasm may be considered the worst case (Cattaneo and Biocca 1999). In general, intrabodies expressed in the secretory compartment are more stable than those expressed in the cytoplasm. This is due to the fact that intradomain disulfide bonds, which contribute 4\u20136 Kcal mol\u20131 to the stability of the antibody domain, do not form in the reducing environment of the cytoplasm (Biocca et al. 1995). As a consequence of the lower stability, some scFvs tend to misfold and aggregate as insoluble proteins. Notwithstanding this fact, it is worth noting that in many cases cytoplasmic-targeted intrabodies bind the antigens and maintain their in vivo functional activity (Cardinale et al. 2001).",

            "text": "This issue is very important and during the last years many selection strategies have been developed to improve stability, solubility and functional properties of antibody fragments under conditions of intracellular expression. Two different strategies have been followed: the knowledge-based and the selection-based approaches. The former relies on the introduction of educated mutations that stabilize pre-existing antibody fragments in order to obtain a \u201csuper-framework\u201d (Jung and Pl\u00fcckthun 1997; W\u00f6rn et al. 2000; Monsellier and Bedouelle 2006). The second approach exploits the availability of different antibody libraries for selection of the best functional molecules for intracellular expression (Hudson and Souriau 2003). For the expression in the cytoplasm, new human phage antibody libraries have been generated based on single framework optimized for intracellular expression (Philibert et al. 2007). On the other hand, highly stable ribosome-display libraries, based on Escherichia coli SecM translation arrest mechanism, have been used for isolating scFvs that are stable under reducing conditions (Contreras-Mart\u0131\u00b4nez and DeLisa 2007). Moreover, antibody-antigen intracellular selection methods have been also developed for the isolation of intrabodies able to efficiently interact with the antigen in vivo. To this aim an in vivo yeast two-hybrid system has been realized, described as intracellular antibody capture (IAC) technology (Visintin et al. 1999). This approach combines a first round of in vitro selection of scFvs with a second round of in vivo screening of selected intrabodies and allows the isolation of antibody domains with no need to use purified antigens. IAC technology has recently allowed the direct in vivo intracellular selection of conformation-sensitive anti-oligomeric scFvs against the Alzheimer\u2019s amyloid \u03b2 peptide (Meli et al. 2009). Another procedure for direct in vivo selection of antigen-specific intrabodies, which utilises a single domain antibody format and is based on a predefined intrabody consensus framework has been described (IAC2) (Tanaka and Rabbitts 2003) and further developed (IAC3) (Tanaka and Rabbitts 2010). This new protocol allows the isolation of functional VH and VL domains from different libraries in four steps, including confirmation of functional intrabodies in mammalian cells.",

In this last case also non-neutralizing antibodies, according to in vitro biochemical criteria, can be effective when expressed in vivo. This can be obtained by adding to the intrabody a specific targeting signal, as the ER retention signal KDEL, which confers to the antigen-antibody complex the retention in the endoplasmic reticulum. In some described cases, intrabodies divert the antigen to the proteasome degradation pathway (Cardinale et al. 2003; Filesi et al. 2007). As mentioned before, intrabodies have different folding performance and stability particularly when they are expressed in the cytoplasm. In this compartment, intradomain disulfide bonds do not form and intrabodies complexed to their corresponding antigen tend to misfold and aggregate. This has been demonstrated for cytoplasmic, nuclear and secretory intrabodies. In the first case they aggregate and form aggresomes in a perinuclear location, whereas in the secretory compartments the antigen-antibody complexes are retrotranslocated from the ER, ubiquitinated and finally proteasome degraded (Filesi et al. 2007).",

During the aggregation process of an amyloidogenic protein many different conformers, including misfolded monomers, oligomers and fibrils are generated (Chiti and Dobson 2006). In the neurodegenerative diseases the aggregation occurs in the brain and is accompanied by cognitive decline. The available therapeutic treatments to slow or prevent these devastating disorders are still not effective, so the development of new molecular therapies that target the pathogenic proteins are urgently needed. In particular, there is great interest in searching new molecules able to prevent unfolding and aggregation either by stabilizing the native state of the amyloidogenic precursors or by disassembling amyloid fibrils. Conformational specific antibodies are very promising agents against neurodegenerative disorders, because they can be raised against different structural isoforms of an amyloidogenic antigen, act at the protein level and can be used in an intrabody approach (Fig. 9.1). Interestingly, although there are no obvious structural or sequence identities among proteins that cause neurodegenerative diseases, it has been shown that conformation-dependent antibodies, raised against a molecular mimic of A\u03b2 oligomers, react with oligomers derived from different kinds of amyloidogenic proteins, such as \u03b1-synuclein, polyglutamine, prions, etc. inhibiting the toxicity associated to these aggregates (Kayed et al. 2003). This finding indicates that the conformational structure rather than the amino acid sequence of these misfolded isoforms is probably the key factor for their neurotoxicity.",

Paganetti et al. generated intrabodies directed to the EFRH peptide adjacent to the \u03b2-secretase cleavage site of human amyloid precursor protein (APP) (scFv-\u03b21). Expression of scFv-\u03b21 along the secretory pathway shields the \u03b2-secretase cleavage site and inhibits the formation of toxic A\u03b2. The KDEL version of the same intrabody is more effective, since it anchors APP in the ER preventing its appearance on the plasma membrane (Paganetti et al. 2005). In another study, the expression of anti-nicastrin intrabodies disrupts the proper folding and glycosylation of the endogenous nicastrin. This protein is required for the stability of the \u03b3-secretase complex. As a result, the anti-nicastrin intrabody suppresses the \u03b3-secretase enzymatic activity in vivo (Hayashi et al. 2009).",

            "text": "Prion diseases are fatal transmissible spongiform encephalopathies affecting humans and animals (Prusiner 1998; Aguzzi et al. 2008). So far, intrabody applications against prion disorders have been targeted to the endogenous prion protein (PrPC). Anti-prion KDEL-8H4 scFv fragments were generated and stably expressed in a neuronal cell line susceptible to scrapie infection. Its intracellular expression causes a marked impairment of prion maturation and translocation towards the membrane compartment, with a strong reduction of the PrPC membrane fraction. As a consequence, the pathogenic scrapie isoform (PrPSc) does not form and accumulate in infected cells (Cardinale et al. 2005). Moreover, mice, intracerebrally injected with a lysate derived from KDEL-8H4 expressing cells infected with scrapie, neither develop scrapie clinical sign nor brain damage, demonstrating effective treatment (Vetrugno et al. 2005). The secretory version of the same intrabody (Sec-8H4), able to recognize PrPC in the secretory pathway, strongly inhibits PrPSc accumulation in 139A scrapie strain infected cells. By analysing its mode of action, it was found that PrPC total level is markedly reduced due to a selective re-routing of PrPC to the proteasome pathway. Moreover, Sec-8H4 intrabody impairs the secretion of endogenous prion molecules associated to exosomes-like vesicles, a potential spreading route for prion infectivity (Filesi et al. 2007). A drastic reduction of PrPSc accumulation was also obtained by co-culturing cells secreting anti-prion scFv fragments with chronically scrapie infected neuroblastoma cells (Donofrio et al. 2005).",

It is caused by the aggregation of mutated forms of huntingtin (htt) protein which present abnormally long polyglutamine (poliQ) sequences at the N-terminal. Cytoplasmic intrabodies directed against the poly-proline region, flanking the polyglutamine region at the C-terminal side of htt, inhibit cell death and aggregation in transiently transfected HEK293 cells, while intrabodies to the polyQ region are cytotoxic and ineffective, because they accelerate aggregate formation and apoptotic cell death (Khoshnan et al. 2002). A phage-derived C4 scFv against the N-terminal portion of htt reduces aggregation and toxicity in cell cultures, in neuronal organotypic slice cultures and in a Drosophila model of HD (Murphy and Messer 2004; Wolfgang et al. 2005; McLear et al. 2008). Another potent intrabody against mutant htt, when expressed in the striatum of HD mice via adenoviral infection, reduces neuropil aggregate formation and ameliorates neurological symptoms (Wang et al. 2008). Interaction of this intrabody with mutant huntingtin increases the ubiquitination of cytoplasmic htt and its degradation, indicating that intrabody-mediated re-routing of htt to the proteasome pathway is the mechanism underlying the protective activity (Fig. 9.1). Furthermore, an intrabody against the N-terminal htt, VL12.3 and another, Happ1, which recognizes the proline rich domain of htt, both prevents htt aggregation and inhibits toxicity in an immortalized striatal cell model of HD by different mechanisms (Southwell et al. 2008). Tested both in brains of five mouse models of HD, VL12.3 increases severity of phenotype and mortality in two models, while Happ1 treatment ameliorates motor, cognitive and neuropathological symptoms (Southwell et al. 2009).",

Cytoplasmic expression of an anti-monomeric \u03b1-synuclein single-chain intrabody rescues the cell adhesion, stabilizes the monomeric isoform and inhibits the formation of high molecular weight insoluble species in a cell model (Zhou et al. 2004).

In the beginning, they have been used to target proteins of the human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) (Lo et al. 2008). Intrabodies equipped with a ER retention signal were employed against the viral coat proteins gp120 and gp41. They caused inhibition of virus replication and syncytial formation (Marasco et al. 1993; Zhou et al. 1998). Inhibition of early and late events of HIV-1 life cycle was also obtained by expression of cytoplasmic intrabodies directed against the matrix protein p17 (Levin et al. 1997) and against proteins involved in replication (reverse transcriptase and Vif). Camelized single-domain intrabodies efficiently interact with HIV-1 Vif protein and neutralize Vif-mediated proviral integration in non permissive cells (Aires da Silva et al. 2004). Moreover, intrabodies that block regulatory proteins, such as Tat and Rev have been used to inhibit HIV-1 replication. A cytosolic anti-Tat scFv fragment modified with a C-terminal human C kappa domain to increase cytoplamic stability inhibits Tat-mediated long terminal repeat (LTR) transactivation and HIV-1 infection in transformed lymphocytes (Mhashilkar et al. 1995; Bai et al. 2003) and a cytosolic anti-Rev scFv fragment inhibits HIV-1 replication in HeLa-T4 cells (Duan et al. 1994). Recently, a llama derived VH domain, selected against the N-terminal \u03b1-helical multimerization domain of Rev, was used to block Rev multimerization and prevent HIV replication (Vercruysse et al. 2010).",

The complex formed by the KDEL-tagged intrabody and the target protein binds to the ERD2 receptors, is transported through the Golgi back to the ER, where it is released.

(d) Re-routing the antigen antibody complex or the prone-misfolded antigen to proteasome degradation. (e) Inhibition of different conformers. Intrabodies that distinguish native and misfolded conformations can be generated and used either to re-route the misfolding-prone protein from its site of aggregation and, eventually, divert it to the proteasome pathway or to inhibit different stages of the aggregation process. This latter mode of action can be achieved through (i) stabilization of the monomeric isoform, (ii) inhibition of oligomerization, (iii) neutralization of potentially toxic oligomeric species, (iv) inhibition of fibril formation and (v) clearing of preformed aggregates",
