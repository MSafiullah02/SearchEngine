Surprisingly, the authors noted that in the Chinese population, the prevalence of thromboembolic events was particularly elevated among patients with severe lung failure. Similar prevalence was observed by Cui et al in 81 patients admitted to intensive care units (ICUs), where the prevalence of major thromboembolism was around 25% [8] . Low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) or unfractionated heparin (UFH) at prophylactic doses are associated with a reduced 28-day mortality in more severe COVID-19 patients [9] , displaying a sepsis-induced coagulopathy (SIC) score \u2265 4 (40.0% vs. 64.2%, P = 0.029) or D-dimer levels more than six-fold the upper limit of normal (32.8% vs. 52.4%, P = 0.017). Comparably, but slightly higher records of thromboembolic complications (up to about 30%) were observed in Italian patients admitted in ICU (unpublished data). These numbers will be smaller but not less than 2% in all Italian COVID-19 patients hospitalized. Normal incidence of deep vein thrombosis in hospitalized Italian patients without COVID-19 is reported 0.025% [10] . One of the possible reasons for the increased frequency of thromboembolic complications in Italian patients could be attributed to higher median age of 45. 5 [4] compared to China at 37.4 [5] . The thromboembolic complications observed in Italian patients affected by severe COVID-19 include venous thromboembolism and pulmonary embolism (VTE). All thromboembolic complications are documented by compressive ultrasonography (CUS) or computerized axial tomography (CT) scan.",

The exact pathogenetic mechanism of COVID-19-related DIC is unclear, although inflammatory drive and cytokine release may be responsible for the Hemostatic Parameters and Risks in COVID-19 J Hematol. 2020;9(1-2):1-4 observed coagulation impairment leading to thromboembolic complications. IL-6 may stimulate up-regulation of fibrinogen synthesis by the liver and the virus may bind directly to endothelial cells causing alveolar damage. DIC appears to be a driver of disease severity and correlates with poor outcome [7] . Furthermore, from 40 autopsies, a quarter presented lung specimens macro-thrombosis with typical pattern of pulmonary embolism and more than twothirds showed thrombi in microvessels, associated with diffuse alveolar damage and interstitial lung infiltrates of granulocytes, macrophages and giant platelets (unpublished data). These reports are in agreement with those of Luo et al [11] . All these findings suggest a mechanism of inflammatory-mediated macro-and micro-thrombosis as a pathogenetic mechanism of damage in the setting of severe COVID-19 infection. The hypothesis of improving the clinical outcome of COVID-19 patients by simple and inexpensive antithrombotic drugs is very appealing, but several issues need to be addressed and clarified before adopting an aggressive approach, in particular defining the appropriate timing for the start of the treatment and the dosage, which may impact concomitant medications.",
