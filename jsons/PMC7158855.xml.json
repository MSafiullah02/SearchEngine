In immunosuppressed subjects, in particular in HIV patients, JC virus (JCV) can cause progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), a fatal diseases of the Central Nervous System (CNS), due to lytic infection of oligodendrocytes. The involvement of JCV in the induction of CNS tumors has also been demonstrated but the mechanism of JCV pathogenesis still represents a controversial issue. P. Ferrante (Milano) described studies to investigate the role of the major capsid protein (VP1) and that of the untranslated Transcriptional Control Region (TCR). Whereas VP1 is the primary determinant of viral entry, different rearrangements of the TCR genomic region, the target of neurotropic transcriptional factors, seem to be linked to JCV pathogenesis.",

To study virus\u2010cell interactions an in vitro model was developed to investigate the kinetic of B19 virus transcription and replication in permissive cell lines (F. Bonvicini, Bologna). The synthesis of viral mRNAs precedes the replication of viral genome. By real\u2010time PCR, the maximum amount of mRNA is detected 24 h post\u2010infection while the peak of viral DNA synthesis at 48 h post\u2010infection. Western blot and IFI analysis documented that viral proteins accumulated 72 h post\u2010infection. To elucidate the restricted host and cell tropism of B19 virus, S. Delbarba (Bologna) described a functional dissection of B19 genomic clones in permissive and non\u2010permissive cell lines. The results obtained with B19\u2010DNA constructs indicated that both non\u2010structural and structural genes are expressed without DNA replication. Delbarba suggested that, in addition to cis\u2010encoded functions, trans\u2010acting functions are needed for replication of B19 virus. F.M. Buonaguro (Napoli) provided epidemiological evidence that in the Italian population HPV16 non\u2010European variants are more oncogenic than European variants. This observation has some remarkable implications for it underlines the need of HPV\u201016 variant identification in the development of specific vaccines and in the optimization of diagnostic protocols.",

Subviral RNAs, satellite RNA (satRNA) and defective interfering RNA (DI RNA), depend entirely on a helper virus genome for replication.

            "text": "M. Pistello (Pisa) discussed on the intimate connection between virus evolution and persistence. The host has developed an immune system able to attack viruses and virally infected cells. On the other hand, viruses have developed strategies to escape the attack of the immune system. The extraordinary ability of viruses to elude immune surveillance networks allows viral persistance in the host. A remarkable example of this has been the worldwide dissemination of HIV with chronic disease development. Whereas virus persistance was allowed by genetic diversity the pathogenicity mechanisms were selected from viral evolution. B. Raccah (Bet Degan) reviewed the biological and molecular aspects of plant viruses\u2013vectors interactions. The survival and spread of plant viruses depend from vectors, in particular insects. In recent years, using molecular tools, some mechanisms were identified that allow virus\u2013vector interactions and persistance of viruses in the vectors. This understanding will hopefully grant us with better tools to combat plant virus spread. A. De Milito (Stockholm, Sweden) described a study investigating the serological memory and B cell dysfunctions in chronic and primary HIV\u20101 infection. Serological memory is significantly reduced in patients with chronic HIV\u20101 infection as shown by reduction of both memory B cells and titers of antibodies to several antigens. This study sheds some light on the course of B cell dysfunctions in primary HIV\u20101 infection, and emphasizes the importance of acute infection in establishing the B cell defects observed in HIV\u20101 chronically infected patients. G. Mangino (Roma) analyzed the effect of HIV\u20101 regulatory protein Nef in the induction of a rapid activation of the NF\u2010kB pathway in human monocyte\u2010derived macrophages after in vitro treatment. P. Caposio (Torino) provided evidence on the essential role of IKK2 in productive replication of HCMV and virus\u2010induced inflammatory response in endothelial cells and emphasized the feasibility of blocking IKK2 activation as a mechanism to prevent virus\u2010mediated inflammation. M.V. Chiantore (Roma) elucidated the mechanism of IFN\u2010\u03b2 on cell\u2010cycle progression and apoptosis\u2010induction in HPV\u2010positive human cervical carcinoma cells. In cervical carcinoma cell lines, although p53 function is inhibited by the HPV E6 oncoprotein, INF\u2010\u03b2 treatment can induce cell death by slowing down the S\u2010phase. A. Ruggeri (Roma) analyzed the effect of HCV core protein expression in HepG2 cell lines. The results showed that HCV core protein might promote cell\u2010cycle progression by increasing the stability of the c\u2010myc oncoprotein. These results are in support of the important role played by the HCV core protein in hepatocarcinogenesis and in virus\u2010mediated pathogenesis in persistently infected hosts. Sequence variations in the BKV regulatory region linked to human polyomavirus associated nephropathy (PVAN) were described by A. Azzi (Firenze). Data suggested that virus genomic variations might play a contributory role to the development of PVAN but these variations were neither sufficient nor necessary for the development of PVAN. F. Dal Pozzo (Bologna) proposed an ex\u2010vivo ovine system, based on the culture of lamb keratinocytes, to study orf virus infection as an alternative to the animal model. Orf virus is an epitheliotropic virus, which can affect sheep, goats, and humans causing contagious ecthyma. This model can be applied in the study of orf pathogenesis and in the search of molecules with antiviral activity. F. Di Serio (Bari) described the interference of peach latent mosaic viroid (PMLV) with chloroplast development. He demonstrated that the pathogenetic determinant consists of a 12\u201313 nucleotides insertion that folds into a short steam, capped by a U\u2010rich tetraloop, present in atypical PLMV. These PTLV variants probably block an early critical step in chloroplast differentiation.",

The limitation of PV replication cycle to the epithelium, together with low\u2010level expression of the virus proteins and absence of inflammation, minimizes the virus exposure to immune cells. Recently, it has been shown that PV can directly interfere with the immune response. While the oncoproteins E6 and E7 are responsible for the interference with interferon signal transduction, E5 down\u2010regulates MHC class I. In addition, PV inhibits interleukin\u201018 activity and the modulation of antigen presentation.",

L. Buonaguro (Napoli) discussed on the efficacy of subtype A HIV\u20101 Virus\u2010like Particles (HIV\u2010VLPAs) as a strategy to induce an effective and prolonged additive/synergistic immunization.

P. Isola (Pisa) proposed that the ORF\u2010A gene of the Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV), that encodes for a protein structurally similar to HIV Tat, could be a target for vaccine development.

Capua (Padova) reviewed the state\u2010of\u2010the\u2010art research on avian influenza viruses and the impact of these viruses on human health, discussing the genetic analysis of the isolates of pandemic infections of the 20th Century. \u201cNew\u201d strains most certainly emerged after reassortment of viral genes of avian and human origin in a permissive host. Avian influenza viruses have been shown to infect human directly. In this circumstance a coinfection with a \u201chuman\u201d influenza virus could give rise to a genetic reassortment with the potential emergence of a virus fully capable of spreading to the human population, but with antigenic characteristics for which the human population would be immunologically na\u00efve. This rare event could result in a true influenza pandemic. F.M. Ruggeri (Roma) highlighted the epidemiology of foodborne virus (FBV) infection as an emerging problem. Although FBVs are generally transmitted via contaminated food, water, and environment, recent research suggests that some FBV infections may also have a zoonotic transmission from either wild or domestic animals. This is a potential risk for the introduction of new strains into the human population. The identification of most FBVs relies upon detection of genomic nucleic acid sequences in clinical specimens or food samples. Generally FBVs cannot be grown in cell cultures. Molecular identification has been difficult, in particular for enteric caliciviruses, for the extreme genomic variability of these viruses. Ruggeri also discussed the importance of a constant remodeling of molecular reagents to make available an array of efficient diagnostic tools and to grant the development of common databases for prompt access to collaborating investigator networks. F. Pacciarini (Milano) described a study on SARS coronavirus (SARS\u2010CoV) replication. He showed that monocyte\u2010derived macrophages could be productively infected by SARS\u2010CoV although at low efficiency. Epidemiological, virological, and phylogenetic analyses of human metapneumovirus (hMPV) strains that occoured in Northern Italy during the 2003\u20132004 winter\u2010spring season were reported by G. Campanini (Pavia). She showed that different types of hMPV co\u2010circulate, and specific primer pairs are required for their overall detection. This consideration suggested the need for developing efficient cell culture system to recover new types of hMPV. F. Maggi (Pisa) provided evidence on correlation between TT Virus infections and levels of eosinophil cationic protein in children with acute respiratory diseases. These findings raise the interesting possibility that active TTV replication represents a heretofore\u2010unrecognized inducer or cofactor in the pathophysiology of these common afflictions. E. Cancellotti (Padova\u2010Edinburgh) described the role of PrP glycosylation in its normal function and in transmissible spongiform encephalopathies in a mouse model. A risk in xenotransplantation is the reactivation of animal viruses that cause xenoinfections in human recipients. E. Caselli (Ferrara) provided evidence of an interaction and a reciprocal reactivation between porcine lymphotropic gamma\u2010herpesviruses and human herpesvirus\u20108. In this regard a coinfection in xenotransplanted patients could induce lytic reactivation of one or both viruses, possibly inducing the development of severe post\u2010transplant pathologies. Molecular characterization of norovirus detected in cattle of Italian herds demonstrated the presence of at last two different lineages of viruses, as reffered by S. Magnino (Pavia). G. Mameli (Sassari) showed evidence for the absence of correlation between expression of the multiple sclerosis\u2010associated retrovirus HERV\u2010W and presence of human herpesvirus\u20106 in multiple sclerosis patients and in controls.",

Serra (Sassari) analyzed the effect of interferon beta on the release of multiple sclerosis (MS)\u2010associated retrovirus (MSVR) in plasma and spinal fluid samples of MS patients. She showed that the release of extracellular MS\u2010MSRV is inhibited by interferon beta both in vivo and in vitro while it is increased by proinflammatory cytokines. The discovery of new drugs for the treatment of HCMV infection could find further impulse by the study presented by A. Loregian (Padova). She demonstrated that overlapping peptides spanning residues 1161 to 1242 of UL54 were able to induced disruption of the interaction between the HCMV DNA polymerase UL54 and UL44 subunits. The results suggested that a few specific side chains are crucial for UL54/UL44 interaction. In this regard small molecules targeting the relevant side chains could interfere with this interaction and inhibit DNA replication. L. Gallina (Bologna) reported the antiviral activity of cidofovir as a candidate for the therapy of contagious ecthyma caused by orf virus. The natural HIV\u20101 genetic polymorphisms associated with different pathways of resistence to multi\u2010nucleoside analogues were discussed by M. Zazzi (Siena). He proposed that different genetic backgrounds might contribute to the development of a specific multi\u2010nucleoside analogue resistance pathway. This knowledge, along with the association between treatment history and resistance mutations, may help to predict and possibly to avoid development of resistance. S.

This study was based on a modified heteroduplex mobility assay strategy allowing a rapid identification of B and non\u2010B clades. B.

Pacenti (Padova) described the effect on anti\u2010retroviral therapy on differentiation and gene expression profile of 3T3\u2010L1 pre\u2010adipocytes. She provided evidence that protease inhibitors activate pro\u2010apoptotic genes and downregulate expression of several genes involved in lipid metabolism and induction of adipocyte differentiation. This could be the basis of HAART\u2010associated lipodystrophy. D. Genovese (Roma) described the molecular characterization of HCV and HBV epidemics in a Northern Italian dialisys center. In both epidemics, the viral phylogenetic analysis showed that one isolate infected three or four patients. High sequence homogeneity was observed for HCV and HBV isolated in acute patients in comparison with chronic patients. Hearing loss defects caused by congenital HCMV infection were discussed by M. Barbi (Milano); the infection prevalence in Italy is close to the lowest values found in the literature. M. Cricca (Bologna) described a real\u2010time PCR approach for determining the physical state and the viral load of HPV\u201016 DNA. In this investigator's view, HPV 16 integration and a higher viral load can be considered as putative early markers of HPV 16 oncogenic progression in chronically infected women.

Further research is needed for developing newer, safer, and more efficient gene transfer vectors for clinical application. C. Ventura (Bologna) described the molecular dissection of cardiogenesis in embryonic stem cells. He underlined the involvement of dynorphin B in autocrine and intracrine signals, which are essential for cardiogenesis. Dynorphin B induced a subcellular redistribution of protein kinase C (PKC) and a remarkable increase in nuclear PKC activity. G. Di Genova (Siena) proposed an anticancer vaccine strategy for prostate carcinoma and other epithelial carcinoma expressing parathyroid hormone related protein (PTH\u2010rP).
