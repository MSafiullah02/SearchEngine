            "text": "The antisense drug G3139 (oblimersen sodium, Genta, Inc.) is a phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) containing unmethylated CpG units, which is targeted to suppress Bcl-2 [1], [2], [3], [4]. It was expected that reduction of Bcl-2 levels would facilitate apoptosis in drug-resistant cancer cells [1], [2]. Over the last several years [3], [4], G3139 has been evaluated in several phase III cancer clinical trials and (unfortunately) it only slightly improves the performance of classical chemotherapeutic agents. I hypothesize that this disappointment is in part due to the fact that most cancer clones have lost p53 activity [5]. Internal stresses of various sorts (metabolic, physical, genotoxic) are communicated to p53 via independent signaling pathways and p53 integrates them into a single level of cellular stress that activates p21 to slow down the cell cycle [6]. If delaying the cell cycle does not allow the cellular stress to be mitigated (e.g., by DNA repair; restoration of pH, Eh or nutrient levels; metabolism or excretion of toxins), then activated p53 reaches a level that summons pro-apoptotic proteins (e.g., Bax and Bak), which initiate apoptosis [7]. Bcl-2 fine-tunes the threshold of stress at which apoptosis occurs by blocking the action of the pro-apoptotic proteins (Fig. 1\n).",

Unmethylated CpG compounds are known to stimulate immune response by activating leucocytes [13]. This would appear to have desirable anti-cancer effects and may, indeed, account for some of the G3139 benefit in pre-clinical studies, but as shown in Fig. 1, Bcl-2 actually plays an important role in inducing apoptosis triggered by external death signals. Specifically, binding of Fas (CD95) on the cell surface (by FasL, TNF, etc.) activates caspase-3, which cleaves Bcl-2 into pro-apoptotic Bax-like fragments [14]. Ironically, G3139 suppresses Bcl-2 such that the benefit of the enhanced immune response (external stress) against tumors appears to be largely lost.",

            "text": "Indeed, this effect of G3139 appears to lead to significant adverse toxicity in cancer trials. G3139 has been shown to suppress Bcl-2 in T-cells, B-cells and monocytes [3]. The combination of activation of immune cells and blocking their Bcl-2 expression leads to substantial apoptosis and neutropenia and thrombocytopenia [4]. It seems clear that G3139 is having an effect in the cells that become infected with HIV [15], [16]. It is probably undesirable to treat individuals who have very low levels of T-cells with G3139. If, however, T-cell levels have been stabilized with HAART [17], then G3139 may well activate transcription of the latent HIV provirus inducing internal stress in the infected T-cells that is not present in the uninfected (bystander) T-cells. Bcl-2 over-expression is essential for the survival of HIV-infected cells that are actively transcribing the provirus [18], [19]. Hence, without the benefit of elevated Bcl-2, these activated, HIV-infected T-cells should preferentially undergo apoptosis. At the same time, lowering the Bcl-2 levels in bystander T-cells makes them less susceptible to external death signals. Thus, suppression of Bcl-2 should concurrently protect uninfected cells from the ravages of HIV-infected T-cells.",
