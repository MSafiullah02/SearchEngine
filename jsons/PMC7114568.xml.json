            "text": "Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) is an emerging viral pathogen that was first reported in 2012 in Hong Kong, China (Woo et al., 2012). In February 2014, the detection of PDCoV was first announced in Ohio, United States, in conjunction with outbreaks of diarrhea without other etiologic agents. Since its emergence, this novel coronavirus has been detected in 17 US states, and almost 80% of the tested samples corresponded to cases of coinfection of PDCoV with other enteric viral pathogens such as a rotavirus or porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (Li et al., 2014, Marthaler et al., 2014a, Marthaler et al., 2014b, Wang et al., 2014). Furthermore, recent independent studies demonstrated that PDCoV can cause severe enteric lesions and clinical diarrhea in the absence of other pathogens in neonatal and gnotobiotic pigs (Jung et al., 2015). Shortly thereafter, PDCoV was identified in Korea in 2 fecal samples independently collected in April and June 2014, and each of which were positive for a rotavirus and negative for other enteric viruses (Lee and Lee, 2014). Genetic and phylogenetic analyses showed that these Korean strains are more closely related to the US strains than to the Hong Kong HKU15 strains (Lee and Lee, 2014).",

The PDCoV genome contains six common coronaviral genes in the following conserved order: 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR)-ORF1a-ORF-1b-S-E-M-N-3\u2032 UTR. ORF1a/b encompasses two-thirds of the genome encoding 2 overlapping viral replicase polyproteins, 1a and 1ab, which are then proteolytically processed into mature nonstructural proteins. As in other coronaviruses, production of polyproteins 1a and 1ab requires a \u22121 ribosomal frameshift during translation of the genomic RNA. The last third of the genome encodes the 4 structural proteins, spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N), as well as two accessory genes, nonstructural gene 6 (NS6) and NS7 gene, between M and N, and within N, respectively (Lai et al., 2007, Lee and Lee, 2014, Li et al., 2014, Marthaler et al., 2014a, Woo et al., 2012).",

As the sole structural component of the viral capsid, the N protein of coronaviruses interacts with the nucleic acid and itself for self-association to protect the viral genome from extracellular agents, serving as the critical basis for ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes during virus assembly (McBride et al., 2014). The entire life cycle of coronaviruses takes place in the cytoplasm of infected cells, and accordingly, the N protein is distributed mainly in the cytoplasmic compartments. In addition to their cytoplasmic localization, coronaviral N proteins are commonly localized to the nucleolus, suggesting their non-structural functions in ensuring successful virus infection (Hiscox et al., 2001, McBride et al., 2014). Although a variety of studies have confirmed that N possesses multifunctional significance in coronavirology (McBride et al., 2014), detailed characteristics of this protein and its role in the replication of PDCoV remain unknown.",

The Escherichia coli strain DH5\u03b1 (RBC Bioscience, Taiwan) was used as the host for general cloning. The full-length N gene was amplified from the PDCoV KNU14-04 strain (Lee and Lee, 2014) with the following primer pair: KNU14-04-N-Fwd (5\u2032-GCCGGTCGACATGGCTGCACCAGTAG-3\u2032) and KNU14-04-N-Rev (5\u2032-CGGCTCTAGACGCTGCTGATTCCTGC-3\u2032), where underlines indicate the SalI and XbaI restriction enzyme sites, respectively. The PCR amplicon was initially inserted into the pBudCE4.1 vector (Invitrogen) that contains a myc epitope and 6 repetitive histidine codons, and the resulting plasmid pBud-PDCoV-N was verified by nucleotide sequencing. Because the PDCoV genome contains one accessory NS7 gene within the N gene in a different reading frame, the presence of NS7 could affect our functional studies of the PDCoV N protein. To prevent any such side effects, the translation initiation codon and the fifth codon of the NS7 ORF were modified to disrupt its expression by pBud-PDCoV-N. To accomplish this, overlapping PCR was conducted to simultaneously change the ATG start codon and the fifth codon of the NS7 gene to TTA and TAA at genomic nucleotide positions 24,096\u201324,098 and 24,108\u201324,110, respectively, using pBud-PDCoV-N as a template with the following primers for the T24097C/T24109A mutation: NS7-KO-Fwd (5\u2032-GGCAAcGGAGTTCCGCTaAACTCCGCCATC-3\u2032) and NS7-KO-Rev (5\u2032-GATGGCGGAGTTtAGCGGAACTCCgTTGCC-3\u2032), where lowercase letters indicate the mutated nucleotides. Both mutations were translationally silent with respect to the ORF encoding the N protein, and the resulting plasmid pBud-PDCoV-Nw/oNS7 was verified by nucleotide sequencing. A fragment of PDCoV N w/oNS7 cDNA that was prepared from pBud-PDCoV-N was then subcloned into the pFB-Neo retroviral vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA) using the SalI and EcoRI restriction sites to construct the PDCoV N gene expression plasmid pFB-Neo-PDCoV-N-myc/His that produces recombinant N protein.",

To date, interactions between this novel virus and the host have not been studied yet. Furthermore, alterations of cellular protein expression in response to PDCoV or each viral protein upon infection currently remain undetermined. In the current study, the PDCoV N protein was chosen in the current study for the proteomic analysis to evaluate specific host cellular responses, which is not only the most abundant viral component but also performs several biological functions in completing viral replication. For this purpose, sublines of PK-15 cells were established to stably express recombinant PDCoV N under the control of a retroviral long-terminal-repeat (LTR) promoter. Ten generated cell clones were initially collected and subjected to RT-PCR and Western blotting to confirm the N gene expression at mRNA and protein levels, respectively (data not shown). According to the results of the Western blot analysis, one PK-PDCoV-N cell clone that constitutively expressed the highest levels of N was selected for subsequent studies.",

As expected, no band corresponding to a disulfide-linked N dimer was detected by SDS-PAGE under non-reducing conditions (Fig. 2\nA, lane 4), indicating that the PDCoV N protein does not undergo cysteine-linked homodimerization.

The staining pattern in PK-PDCoV cells was found to be predominantly cytoplasmic and nucleolic; this pattern persisted for up to 60 h after seeding (Fig. 3\nA). Nearly all cells expressing PDCoV N showed distinct fluorescent signals in the nucleolus at 48 h post-seeding, and thereafter, the PDCoV N protein was localized mainly to the cytoplasm at 72 h post-seeding. The nucleolar localization of PDCoV N was confirmed by transient transfection of BHK-21 or ST cells with the plasmid pBud-PDCoV-N (Fig. 3B). The cell fractionation assay also revealed the presence of the N protein in both the cytoplasmic and nucleic fractions (Fig. 3C). These observations demonstrated that, like N proteins of other coronaviruses, PDCoV N protein is mostly distributed in the nucleolus along with the cytoplasm and has a conserved subcellular localization property.",

Subsequently, the trypsin-digested spots were subjected to MALDI-TOF analysis. With combined PMF and database searching, identity of all 10 proteins was successfully determined. Information on all these proteins in PK-PDCoV-N cells, with their protein scores and sequence coverage, is summarized in Table 1\n. To better understand the implications of the cellular responses to the PDCoV N protein, we further categorized the identified proteins by biological processes according to the Gene Ontology database as described previously (Zhang et al., 2009). These proteins showing altered expression were associated with various cellular functions including intracellular transport, metabolic processes, gene regulation, the stress response, protein synthesis, cytoskeleton networks, and cell division. Since changes in cellular protein expression may be attributed to alterations in the corresponding mRNA levels, transcriptional changes for all the identified proteins were tested by real-time RT-PCR to confirm the results of the proteomic analysis (Fig. 5\n). We were able to detect mRNAs corresponding to nearly all proteins identified by proteomics, except for histone H4. Although the altered expression levels of the remaining 9 proteins were consistent with the real-time RT-PCR results, we observed only modest increase or reduction in mRNA levels. These results could be explained the case the correlation between mRNA and protein abundance could be insufficient to predict protein expression levels from quantitative mRNA data (Gygi et al., 1999), suggesting that the differences in protein levels might be due to post-translational modifications or protein stability rather than mRNA levels.",

            "text": "Since viruses are obligate intracellular parasites, they must utilize the cellular machinery and biosynthetic components of the host cell for their own replication. After viral infection, the infected cells launch a number of host antiviral defensive responses, which are turned on to eliminate the invading viruses. On the other hand, viruses employ their own evasion strategies to complete their replication and to successfully spread to neighboring cells. This series of interactions between the virus and host results in compensatory modifications in cellular gene production. Accordingly, numerous studies have been extensively conducted by means of various molecular and genomic methods to understand how the altered host gene expression affects viral infection and the associated pathogenic processes. The proteomic analysis coupling high-resolution 2DE and MALDI-TOF/MS is a tool that can generate ample data on cellular protein profiles modified by viral replication. With the proteomic techniques, it is now possible to identify relative changes in protein abundance for evaluation of host cellular responses to viral infection or viral protein expression and to gain specific insights into the cellular mechanisms involved in viral pathogenesis (Alfonso et al., 2004, Brasier et al., 2004, Neuman et al., 2008, Oh and Lee, 2012, Ringrose et al., 2008, Sagong and Lee, 2010, Zhang et al., 2008). In the present work, a proteomic approach was applied for profiling the global protein expression changes in host cells in response to the N protein of PDCoV, which is a major constituent of the virion and infected cells. Therefore, we initially established a porcine cell line stably expressing the PDCoV N protein and then characterized the N protein produced in those cells. Due to the absence of cysteine residues, a disulfide-linked homodimeric N protein of PDCoV was not detected in PK-PDCoV-N cells. Rather, the PDCoV N protein was shown to be self-assembled via non-covalent oligomerization as a structural component for formation of the viral capsid. Interestingly, the N protein of PDCoV was found to be predominantly present in both the cytoplasm and nucleolus of PK-PDCoV-N cells. The localization of nidovirus N proteins to the nucleolus may be necessary for control of RNA synthesis or ribosome biogenesis via association with ribosomal subunits and interaction with nucleolar proteins (Chen et al., 2002, Lee et al., 2006, Wurm et al., 2001, Yoo et al., 2003;). Similarly, the PDCoV N protein may participate in such a viral strategy to favor viral replication and pathogenesis. In addition, the nucleolar localization sequence detector program (http://www.compbio.dundee.ac.uk/www-nod/) predicted that PDCoV N harbors a putative nucleolar localization signal (NoLS) consisting of a stretch of basic amino acids. Therefore, further research is needed to identify a functional NoLS to confirm the intracellular localization of the PDCoV N protein. These biological characteristics of N gene-expressing cells have yet to be confirmed using an authentic N protein in PDCoV-infected cells, but according to our results, PDCoV N appears to act as a multifunctional protein playing structural and non-structural roles contributing to completion of viral replication. Our proteomic data revealed that 10 differentially expressed cellular proteins are identifiable in PDCoV N gene-expressing porcine cells. The proteins that we identified in this study are involved in diverse cellular processes: metabolism, the stress response, protein biosynthesis and transport, cytoskeleton networks and cell communication, and cell division. The significance of the functional roles of the selected host proteins affected by the interaction of the PDCoV N protein with the host cell is discussed below.",

            "text": "The most interesting finding in the present study is that two cellular chaperone proteins belonging to the HSP70 family are up-regulated concomitantly by the N protein of PDCoV. The first up-regulated protein is GRP78 in cells expressing the PDCoV N protein, which is associated with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. In eukaryotic cells, the ER is the major site for synthesis and folding of transmembrane and secreted proteins, and accordingly, animal viruses also use the ER as a site of synthesis and processing of their own proteins. The amount of protein entering the ER can differ under physiological and environmental conditions. If protein synthesis exceeds the folding capacity of the ER, unfolded proteins accumulate there, resulting in ER stress. To maintain the ER homeostasis, cells have developed a signaling pathway known as the unfolded protein response (UPR) that transmits signals across the ER membrane to the cytosol and the nucleus and ultimately reduces protein translation and enhances the ER folding capacity by up-regulating chaperone proteins (Ron and Walter, 2007). Coronavirus infection of cultured cells is known to cause ER stress and to induce the UPR, which then crosstalks with various cellular signaling pathways, including mitogen-activated protein kinase cascades, autophagy, apoptosis, and innate immune responses, indicating the involvement of UPR activation in virus\u2013host interactions and viral pathogenesis (Fung et al., 2014, Fung and Liu, 2014). More interestingly, global proteomic and microarray analyses have shown that the expression of chaperon proteins, such as GRP78 and GRP94, is up-regulated in cells infected with a human coronavirus or in cells expressing the S2 subunit (Jiang et al., 2005, Yeung et al., 2008). Furthermore, the N protein of PEDV, another porcine coronavirus, overexpression was shown to trigger ER stress (Xu et al., 2013). Thus, it appears that PDCoV infection may induce ER stress and the UPR, leading to the up-regulation of GRP78 to counteract the ER stress; hence, the N protein may be responsible for this stress response pathway. The second identified HSP70 family protein is HSC70, also known as heat shock 70-kDa protein 8 (HSPA8). HSC70 is a molecular chaperone with multiple functions in protein folding and trafficking in all eukaryotic cells and in protecting cells from apoptosis or a wide array of stressors such as heat and infection (Morano, 2007, Powers et al., 2008, Takayama et al., 1999). Accumulating evidence has shown that HSC70 plays important roles in certain processes involved in viral infection by modulating cell entry, virion disassembly and assembly, and the cellular antiviral response and apoptosis (Chuang et al., 2015, Guti\u00e9rrez et al., 2010, Ivanovic et al., 2007, Liu et al., 2013, Radhakrishnan et al., 2010, Yan et al., 2010). Apoptosis is considered an innate defense mechanism that limits propagation of a virus by eliminating infected cells (Everett and McFadden, 1999). Therefore, many viruses have evolved to employ various strategies that inhibit apoptosis in order to prevent premature cell death, thereby securing sufficient time for progeny production. Thus, a conceivable explanation is that PDCoV may take the advantage of suppressing apoptosis by up-regulating HSC70 in the early phase of the infection, and the N protein seems to be involved in this mechanism. In addition, HSC70 mediates the nuclear export of the influenza virus ribonucleoprotein complex via interaction with viral proteins M1 and NS2 (Watanabe et al., 2006, Watanabe et al., 2014). In the present study, we found that PDCoV N can be localized to the nucleolus in N-expressing cells. On the other hand, N proteins must be trafficked from the nucleolus to the cytoplasm to accomplish nucleocapsid assembly as well as viral RNA synthesis and virus\u2013host interactions. According to our results and existing data, HSC70 may facilitate the export of PDCoV N from the nucleolus to complete the viral life cycle.",

            "text": "Like many other viruses, coronaviruses turn off host protein translation, while continuing to the synthesis of their own gene products to finish viral replication. One of the mechanisms behind this translational suppression is through interaction of the N protein with elongation factor 1\u03b1 (EF1\u03b1), a major translation factor in mammalian cells (Zhou et al., 2008). In the present study, the amount of another translational factor, EF2, was affected by the host response to the PDCoV N protein. Although we do not know whether the increased expression of EF2 is related to its binding to PDCoV N, such differential expression of a translation factor may be associated with regulation of both host and viral protein synthesis. We also found that expression of the cytoskeletal protein ezrin is significantly enhanced by the N protein. Ezrin is a member of the ezrin\u2013moesin\u2013radixin (EMR) family of host cytoskeletal proteins that organize the cortical cytoskeleton by mediating interactions between actin and the plasma membrane proteins and function as signal transducers in numerous signaling pathways (Neisch and Fehon, 2011). The EMR also modulate RNA virus infection by regulating stable and dynamic microtubule formation (Bukong et al., 2013, Haedicke et al., 2008, Naghavi et al., 2007). Given the biological features of the EMR proteins, the up-regulation of ezrin in our study suggests that the PDCoV N protein may manipulate the host cytoskeletal network and cell signaling, possibly to facilitate the processes of viral infection and replication.",

            "text": "In contrast, the expression of translocon-associated protein subunit delta (TRAPD) is suppressed in cells expressing the PDCoV N protein, according to our results. TRAPD is a part of the TRAP complex that is involved in translocating proteins across the ER membrane and in regulating the retention of ER resident proteins (Fons et al., 2003). Coronaviruses acquire their lipid envelop via budding of the nucleocapsid through the ER\u2013Golgi intermediate compartment (McBride et al., 2014). The down-regulation of TRAPD may lead to the release of cellular proteins from the ER during PDCoV replication, which in turn, promotes translocation of envelope-associated viral structural proteins to the ER membrane \u2013 the site of budding \u2013 to facilitate virus assembly. Eukaryotic cells reprogram their metabolism to adapt to stress-induced damage in response to environmental stressors. Among our differentially expressed proteins, some are either directly or indirectly involved in metabolism. One hypothesis that can explain this result is that production of the N protein affects cellular biosynthesis by modulating the expression of metabolism-related proteins, which in turn remodels the intracellular environment for optimal PDCoV replication.",

Although definite functions of the proteins that we identified here were not determined, it is likely that alterations in their expression are involved in virus\u2013host interactions. To resolve these questions as well as performing various PDCoV research, obtaining a Korean PDCoV isolate that can grow in cell culture is necessary; we are currently working on this task. In future studies, we are planning to assess cellular responses to PDCoV by proteomic analysis to validate our present data; the proteins that are differentially expressed in the cells overexpressing PDCoV N or in the cells infected with PDCoV can be analyzed in detail in order to identify their precise function in the replication of PDCoV. On the other hand, one limitation of the proteomic methodology used in this study is the inability to reliably detect low-molecular-weight or low-abundance proteins such as cytokines, which are involved in the host immune response. Therefore, more comprehensive works are also needed to expand our present findings and to explore other proteins that may play a role in host responses to this protein. Nevertheless, the data presented here are expected to advance the knowledge about the molecular mechanisms associated with PDCoV\u2013host interactions and viral pathogenesis.",
