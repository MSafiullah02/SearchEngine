We also reported that IFNL3 rs8099917 was useful for the prediction of SVR in patients infected with HCV genotype 1 [9]. However, the mechanism between IFNL3 and clearance of HCV has been unclear despite the extensive work [10\u201312]. We also reported that IFNL3 induces IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) such as IFN-\u03b3-inducible protein (IP-10) that are reportedly associated with the progression of HCV-related pathogenesis and antiviral activities against HCV [12].",

Written informed consent was obtained from all patients, and the study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Chiba University, School of Medicine (number 428). All patients were of Asian origin and infected with HCV genotype 1. They underwent standard antiviral therapy with the combination of peg-IFN plus ribavirin [4] or telaprevir with peg-IFN plus ribavirin [17, 18]. HCV RNA was measured at baseline, at weeks 4 and 12, at the end of treatment, and at 24 weeks after the end of treatment. SVR was defined as undetectable serum HCV RNA at 24 weeks after the end of treatment. Patients with undetectable HCV RNA at 4 and 12 weeks after the commencement of treatment were considered to have had rapid virological response (RVR) and early virological response (EVR), respectively [19]. Relapse was defined as undetectable HCV RNA at the end of treatment, but it reappeared after the end of treatment [20]. Null response was defined as less than 2 log10 decrease in HCV RNA (IU/mL) from baseline after 12 weeks of therapy [20].",

IFNL3 and these p179 (IFNL4) proteins are most related within the sequences, corresponding to the A and F helices of IFNL3, which constitute the core area for interaction of IFNL3 with its primary receptor, IFNLR1 (IL28R1) [13]. The beneficial insertion ss469415590-TT allele could abrogate IFNL4. IFNL4 signaling via IFN\u03bb receptor could regulate antiviral activity against coronaviruses as well as HCV [26]. Manuel et al.
