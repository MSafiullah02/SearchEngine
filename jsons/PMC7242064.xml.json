This document describes two systems from the automotive domain: an adaptive exterior light system (ELS) and a speed control system (SCS). This specification is based on the SPES XT running example [3]. Besides their general architectures, the requirements of the software based controllers are described. Both systems are only loosely coupled, which makes it possible to handle them independently.",

Most of them are nowadays realized in software running on a bunch of electronic control units (ECUs) with connected actuators and sensors. These ECUs are connected via several bus and network techniques like CAN, LIN, or FlexRay (depending on the needed band width and reliability). The avoidance of a single central unit is three-fold: First, the risks with a single-point of failure are reduced, second, the limited space and energy of a car restricts the possible technologies, and third, there is the constant need to balance the weight and space consumption of wiring harness with space and weight consumption of decentral control units that are placed nearby the actuators. Despite the pressure to realize more and more in software, some functions are still implemented in hardware. For example, in this specification it is assumed that the detection of a defective bulb is realized by a corresponding electronic circuit.\n",

If one of the values is found to be extremely close, the status is set to \u201cDirty\u201d. During the self-test and with other errors (strong fluctuations, very different values of the individual sensors) the status is set to \u201cNotReady\u201d.SCS-41If the radar sensor self-test device reports a fault (Dirty or NotReady), all systems depending on the distance to the vehicle must be suspended and the driver must be warned by an appropriate light in the instrument cluster (not part of this specification). In this case, the self-test of the radar system is restarted every 10 min.SCS-42The gas or brake pedal depressed by the driver must always be able to override a target speed specified by the system.SCS-43If the system performs a brake action, the brake lights must be activated as if the brake pedal has been pressed by the driver (see light system specification).\n",
