The technique is also constantly evolving due to the development of ion sources and the construction of analyzers, improvements in the fragmentation process, and progress in software capabilities. Consequently, the application area is broadening. Starting as a tool to solve particular problems in physics and chemistry, from the mid-1980s, MS has become one of the essential tools for a broad range of sciences and industries. The dynamic development of \"biological\" MS was initiated by the discovery of soft ionization techniques: electrospray by Yamashita and Fenn (1984) and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) introduced by Tanaka et al. (1988) . Both inventors were rewarded with a Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2002. Since the introduction of both ion sources into laboratory routine, we have observed milestone discoveries in life sciences, medicine, nanotechnologies, environmental protection, and chemistry, which would not be possible without mass spectrometers. Moreover, some fields were formed because this tool was created, and this includes proteomics, metabolomics, and tissue MS imaging.",

The interaction between the virus and the host which has developed over time is complex and sometimes unexpected. Thus, virology requires increasingly more sophisticated tools to progress. MS is one of the unique tools allowing us to look into the fate of the information delivered to the cell by a virus, and visualize the changing microenvironment of the infected cell. Some of the applications of MS encompass the physicochemical characterization of virions and viral proteins during the infection, evaluation of the interactions between viral proteins and between viral and cellular proteins, analysis of proteome alterations in the infected cell, and the design and testing of the efficacy and cytotoxicity of antivirals. A separate branch includes high molecular weight (MW) measurements of the whole viruses and identification of their assembly dynamics during capsid formation in a time-dependent manner. Using this technique, it is possible to observe the formation of capsids and them filling with nucleic acids, providing insight into the fascinating process of viral replication. In such cases, MS achieves new frontiers in the mass measurement range, almost reaching mass values of the microscopic objects.",

In some cases, especially in medical applications, the time required for the identification of the pathogen is a critical factor for the application of appropriate therapies. To date, MS has been routinely used for the identification of infectious microorganisms, but current MS-based approaches could also be effective toward the identification of viruses infecting humans. As some viral infections develop relatively rapidly and, due to their high infectivity, pose a threat to the human or animal population, fast methods of detection of the etiological factor are required. However, such analyses seem to be difficult due to viral biology, as only scarce amounts of viral proteins are present in body fluids during the early stages of the infection. One may speculate that the infection may be sensed earlier, by the analysis of antigens presented in the context of major histocompatibility complex type II (MHC II) by infected cells; however, analytical approaches identifying such presentations are missing thus far. A similar analysis has also been carried out for the development of effective vaccines, which is another field in which virology and MS mingle. MS is used to design vaccines, but it is also used to verify the content and quality of this versatile medicinal products. Thus, the importance of MS in virology seems to be obvious, as combining those two fields offers new research perspectives. Although there are some reviews on this subject (Cobo, 2013; Greco et al., 2014) , the area is developing rapidly, and any attempt to summarize the latest achievements may be helpful. Moreover, the broader presence of this subject to the scientists involved in MS may result in new solutions to the obstacles in this field.",

However, once they enter the host, they hijack the cellular machinery to serve their purpose, changing the cell into a virus factory that becomes invisible to defense systems. A virus particle carries information in the form of RNA or DNA, which, in complex with the capsid proteins, forms the viral core. This nucleocapsid is protected by the shell built of proteins (naked viruses) or a lipid bilayer (enveloped viruses), which protects the viral genetic material in the hostile extracellular environment. Regardless of the virus type, the shell is always decorated with the proteins responsible for attachment and entry to the host cell, which initiates the replication cycle.",

Each viral species is fitted to use a limited number of receptors, which is one of the most important determinants of tissue and species specificity. The binding initiates the complex process of virus entry, which ends up in the delivery of the viral genetic material to the replication site: the cytoplasm or the nucleus, where the replication starts. Viral proteins are expressed and initiate remodeling of the cell by the formation of intracellular structures serving as viral factories and protecting viral components from detection by the natural defense mechanisms. Eventually, the viral replication machinery initiates production of progeny nucleic acids, which interact with the capsid protein (s) forming nucleocapsids. These macromolecules are further matured, and the shell is formed. The release may occur simply due to the disruption of the host cell, but cellular transport routes are frequently utilized, and virions are slowly released to the extracellular space, which finalizes the viral cycle.",

            "text": "With the aid of MS, it is possible to determine the molecular masses of substances with very high accuracy. However, with an increase in mass, there is a decrease in resolution due to the physical limitations of the method and the properties of the samples (e.g., natural heterogeneity of the molecules, oligomerization in solution, incomplete desolvation, and low MW salt molecules attached (Fuerstenau & Benner, 1995; L\u00f6ssl et al., 2014) ). Along with the molecular mass increase, even in cases of highly homogenous material, average mass dissipation due to isotopic patterns of atom building molecules, becomes notable. Furthermore, viral units of the same species should have the same MW, but such sample homogeneity is rarely achieved. Until recently, other analytical techniques like dynamic light scattering, electron microscopy (mainly in transmission mode, transmission electron microscopy (TEM)) or laser diffraction spectroscopy have seemed to be more adequate for large particles (weighing hundreds of megadaltons (MDa) or even gigadaltons (GDa)). Currently, MS proposes some solutions for the analyses of monoor multimolecular particles in a given range of MW. Viruses, bacteriophages, and other small infectious agents are at the edge between MS mass measurement capabilities and other, previously listed, techniques. However, the increasing precision of MS encourages its use in analyses in the viral world. The most commonly used assays in virology focus on measurements of the proteins building capsids, their interactions with the cell membrane, assembly dynamics, envelope composition, and the role of chaperone proteins in the construction of fully functional capsids. Such approaches lead to the development of new techniques in the analysis of high MW using MS and broaden the frontiers of this type of analyses. The most commonly used analytical techniques, involving MS, applied in the detection of high MW molecules or molecular aggregates (like viruses) are: charge-detection mass spectrometry (CDMS) and ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) or differential mobility sectrometry (DMS)based analyzers like gas-phase electrophoretic mobility molecular analysis (GEMMA). There are also newer modifications of electrospray ionization (ESI)-or MALDI-based systems, such as detection by nanomechanical resonators, which could provide additional insights in the viral microenvironment.",

(1960) during simulations of micrometeoroid behavior. CDMS focuses on the simultaneous measurement of the charge (z) and m/z ratio of the single ion rather than on the calculation of the MW of the molecules, based on the mass spectrum (Fuerstenau & Benner, 1995) . Results are shown as a plot of MW (usually presented in MDa) as a function of the density of ions charges detected by the instrument (see Fig. 1 ). This methodology was adopted in the area of biological applications to molecular mass estimation of DNA (Schultz et al., 1998) and viruses (rice yellow mottle virus and tobacco mosaic virus; Fuerstenau et al., 2001) . Here, typical MS was also unable to directly measure MWs of such large objects. Instead, a smart modification of the mass spectrometer was applied: after ESI, highly charged, viral capsids were guided through an amplifier, able to estimate their total charge, which was proportional to the current measured. As an additional verification, the time of flight of the molecules measured in the time-of-flight (TOF) analyzer was evaluated. M/z ratios were calculated based on both measurements, allowing for the acceptable precision of the measurement.",

On the other hand, accuracy and speed of analysis is limited due to measurement methodology, as well as physical limitations. CDMS measures single ion parameters with a speed reaching 1,000 ions/min, which means that the time of analysis is long in comparison to other MS-based techniques. Additionally, the resolution of CDMS is also limited, but in a measured range of MDa or even GDa, precise MW calculations has minor importance. Continuous improvement of this method is also observed, like in case of increase in sensitivity of CDMS using so called pulsed mode (Todd & Jarrold, 2019) .",

This works as a connection of electrospray or nanospray ion sources with a DMA. The principles of analysis using this approach were described in detail elsewhere (Kaufman et al., 1996; Guha et al., 2012; Pease, 2012; Campbell et al., 2015) Briefly, multiply charged ions formed after electrospraying are directed to the neutralizing chamber and then to the DMA (Kaufman et al., 1996) . In the neutralizing chamber, ions interact with \u03b1-particles generated by 210 Po. Charge-reduced molecules are traveling to DMA and there their electrical mobility diameter is measured. The result is given in nanometers, in contrast to the typical MS analyses (see Fig. 3 ), but in some cases can be graded in Da as well (see Fig. 2 ). The difference between DMA and typical IMS stays in ion trajectories. In DMA ion travel, trajectory is an effect of the interaction between electric field generated in analyzer electrodes and drift gas flow, moving ortogonally to the direction of ion travel, while ions move in the FIGURE 1.

            "text": "GEMMA is widely used in investigations related to viral interactions with eukaryotic cells. Specifically, it has been used to estimate the binding ratio between antibodies and viral capsids when conventional MS-based methods failed. Bereszczak et al. (2014) used ESI-Q-TOF and ion mobility MS to measure MWs of antibody-hepatitis virus complexes up to ca. 8 MDa with the additional validation of results with the aid of GEMMA and cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM). As it would be difficult to directly measure molecular mass, based on Q-TOF system in the given MW range, the authors successfully used estimations based on predicted charge load on the ionized molecules and verified the results with other methods (Bereszczak et al., 2014) . Far earlier, the ESI-GEMMA technique was developed as a convenient method for the analysis of high MW molecular complexes (Loo et al., 2005; Allmaier et al., 2008) . Kaddis et al. (2007) have proven the usability of this methodology for the analysis of large molecules as well as high MW noncovalent complexes up to more than 9 MDa (Kaddis et al., 2007) . Nowadays, GEMMA-based systems seem to be reliable alternatives to other analytical methods, typically used in the investigations of interactions between big molecules. An excellent discussion of the advances of this technique is provided in the work of Havlik et al. where interactions between tick-borne encephalitis virus and the vaccine formulations were investigated by various techniques. The authors compared results from GEMMA, atomic force microscopy (AFM) and TEM. They found that the size distribution pattern of viral capsids at various stages of vaccine preparation defines the behavior of capsids assembly dynamics significantly better than microscopic methods, which mainly comes from sample preparation methodology for each of the techniques. It seems that sample preparation for GEMMA is the least invasive and does not significantly affect the final result (Havlik et al., 2015) . Compared with other methods used for molecular mass estimation, this technique is cheaper, less time consuming and simpler in application than concurrent techniques, like ESI-TOF-MS, CDMS (more time consuming), or microscopic techniques like TEM, AFM, cryo-EM (higher costs, sophisticated sample preparation, result dependent on sample prep; Weiss et al., 2019) .",

It is generally an agreement in the literature that it is possible to measure total viral capsids as well as their fragment parameters, like dimensions or MW, with sufficient accuracy using methods already described in this chapter. Some interesting data in the measurement range reaching even GDa have been shown by Hogan et al. (2006) : during the electrospraying of bacteriophage MS2 with further analysis by DMA, the dimension of their capsids was estimated to be 24.13 \u00b1 0.06 nm. Measurements did not influence the viability of the phages, which was confirmed in bacterial cells, since phages were still able to infect Escherichia coli strains after electrospraying. The limit of measurement was rather related to physical frontiers of the ESI than to dimensions of the particles, that is, bigger phages, such as T2 or T4, were not fully covered by the solvent droplets during electrospray formation. This resulted in fragmentation and the complete loss of phage function. Furthermore, the authors were able to separately detect capsids and tails of phage Lambda. This observation verified the possibility of in-source fragmentation of the bigger phages during ionization process, which was somehow related to dimensions of spraying droplets. Unfortunately, the exact fragmentation mechanism was not proposed and remains unknown.",

As a model object, phage PR772 was used, which belongs to the Tectiviridae family. Using the ESI-DMA system, the authors were able to determine the time-dependent formation of the icosahedral capsids. With this approach, it was possible to observe the intermediates (i.e., incompletely assembled capsids) formed by viral proteins. Other experiments showed capsid degradation kinetics in the natural environment and during heating of the sample. The ability to determine the symmetry of capsids, the number of major protein copies per capsid in the walls and vertexes and other geometry-based data using ESI-DMA is an excellent, fast and cost-effective supplement for the most expensive and time-consuming techniques, ike cryo-EM, small-angle neutron scattering, or X-ray crystallography.

Moreover, in such types of mass spectrometer, ionization of the measured objects does not necessarily increase the quality of analysis. The system uses an electrospray ion source, or a surface acoustic wave nebulization source, but focusing and guiding of the particles measured is carried out based on molecule inertia rather than the charge. The authors of this experimental system obtained satisfactory results in the measurements range from ca. 20 to 110 MDa, analyzing empty capsids and those filled with phage DNA of the bacteriophage T5. It is also worth mentioning that polystyrene nanoparticles at a diameter of ca. 45 nm (validated by scanning electron microscopy) were used as a reference material.

Further, these viruses are formed in a highly organized manner, adopting certain symmetry with a well-defined number of protein mers forming the shell. This makes the analysis rather straightforward and, to date, several reports on nonenveloped virus composition have been published. Adenoviruses are among the best-studied. In a work by Chelius et al. (2002) , the human adenovirus (hAV) type 5 was used as a model virus and its capsid composition was analyzed using LC-MS/MS. As all of the major proteins were identified using one-and two-dimensional chromatographic separations, it was concluded that LC-MS/MS was an appropriate tool for such analysis. More recently, Benevento et al. demonstrated a more comprehensive method to evaluate hAV capsid protein composition. The researchers employed LC-MS/MS and selected reaction monitoring (SRM), which allows the abundance of small molecules or group of proteins after their enzymatic digestion to be quantified based on the unique peptides released. Next, they monitored the protein content changes in virions upon heatinduced disassembly, which was aimed to mimic the entry process. As a result, some proteins were identified as important players during virus release from the endosome to the cytosol (Benevento et al., 2014) . Interestingly, MS studies on nonenveloped viruses revealed the usefulness of these methods evaluation of viral protein activity. Salganik and colleagues studied the adeno-associated viruses (AAV) to identify proteolytic active sites which catalyze autolytic cleavage of viral capsids. The researchers employed LC-MS/MS analysis to identify the cleavage sites within capsid proteins and to show that AAV particles contain an intrinsic protease activity that is activated in the acidic environment of cellular endosomal compartments. Using both mass spectrometric analysis and N-terminal Edman sequencing, they identified unique autocleavage sites in AAV type 1 (AAV1) and AAV9. Results showed that AAV protease may have an important role in virus infection (Salganik et al., 2012) . Furthermore, a direct LC-MS/MS analysis proven to be effective in characterizing AAV capsid proteins (VPs) in variety of AAV serotypes (Jin et al., 2017) . Soon after, Zhang et al. described a novel method to characterize AAV capsid proteins. A microfluidic ZipChip capillary electrophoresis linked to mass spectrometer (CE/MS) was employed for the identification of three AAV2 proteins: VP1, VP2, and VP3. Researchers described the ZipChip CE/MS as a powerful method to confirm AAV serotype identity, which could support recombinant AAV gene therapy development . Recently, MS techniques were also utilized in the analysis of the AAV capsid glycosylation profile. Aloor et al. employed high resolution MALDI-TOF and identified N-glycosylation of AAV8 capsid protein. These results showed that, contrary to previous data, AAV capsids are prone to glycosylation, which may influence AAV tropism (Aloor et al., 2018) . In fact, MS-based methods enable the robust characterization of N-and O-linked glycans in complex virus samples, especially in glycoprofiling viral surface proteins (see also in posttranslational modification (PTM) analyses, subchapter IV.C and useability of glycan analysis in vaccine development, subchapter VIII.B).",

McKnight et al. employed a quantitative LC-MS/MS analysis to show that eHAV contain proteins of endolysosomal compartments and lack markers of autophagy.

As a result, numerous host proteins were identified, including histones or proteins of the endosomal pathway (Chertova et al., 2006; Saphire et al., 2006) . Further studies also described other host proteins that are incorporated into HIV-1 particles and interact specifically with viral proteins and these included Tsg101, cyclophilin A, and Apobec3G. All of these appeared to affect HIV-1 infection: Tsg101 plays a role in virus assembly, cyclophilin A regulates infectivity, whereas Apobec3G promotes hypermutation of HIV-1 genome, which causes lethal mutational loads that terminate progeny virus production and propagation (Franke et al., 1994; Braaten & Luban, 2001; Garrus et al., 2001; Demirov et al., 2002; Lecossier et al., 2003; Mangeat et al., 2003; Mariani et al., 2003) . Furthermore, sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and 2D SDS-PAGE, followed by MALDI-TOF or nanoLC-MS/MS, were used in several studies leading to the identification of biomarkers in body fluids (cerebrospinal fluid, serum, cellular extracts) of HIV-infected patients Rozek et al., 2007; Wiederin et al., 2009 ). In addition, recent work by Schlatzer et al. shows detection of latent HIV-1 reservoirs. Researchers employed SRM to unambiguously identify latent reactivated virus reservoirs using Gag protein detection (Schlatzer et al., 2017) .",

The combination of these two methods enabled the identification of all SARS-CoV structural proteins. Also, MALDI-TOF, followed by N-glycosidase digestion, enabled the identification of several glycosylation sites in SARS-CoV spike protein (SARS-CoV S) (Krokhin et al., 2003) . The authors claimed that further analysis may demonstrate the importance of SARS-CoV S N-glycosylation in receptor recognition and virus entry to the cell, but a report by Chakraborti et al. showed that glycosylation of SARS-CoV S did not influence virus binding to its entry receptor (Chakraborti et al., 2005) . On the other hand, a few years later, Zhou et al. demonstrated that a single N-glycosylation site in SARS-CoV S is important for the interaction with the mannose-binding lectin (MBL)-a serum protein involved in activating the complement system. The identified N-linked glycosylation site N330 appeared to be critical for binding of S protein by MBL and further inhibition of virus infection. Interestingly, the interaction between virus fusion protein and MBL had a various effect on S-mediated binding to host cell receptors-it blocked SARS-CoV binding to DC-SIGN, but did not affect interaction with ACE2 . MS was also used for determination of the infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) capsid composition. Kong et al. studied the purified IBV particles and analyzed them with two-dimensional gel electrophoresis fractionation, tryptic digestion, and MALDI-TOF. Apart from IBV structural proteins, 60 host proteins involved in the function of cytoskeleton, ribosomes, chromosomes, as well as in intracellular trafficking, signal transport were identified (Kong et al., 2010) .",

In a work by Shaw et al., purified influenza A virus particles were analyzed using both LC-MS/MS and MudPIT columns (capillary columns filled with SCX/C18 beads allowing for 2D chromatography in a single capillary). As a result, 9 of 11 viral proteins were detected, together with 36 host-encoded proteins. These included both cytoplasmic, as well as membrane-associated proteins, some of which were present on the virus envelope. These data helped to define cellular requirements for virus replication, but also proposed novel targets for antiviral therapy (Shaw et al., 2008) . Also, Hutchinson et al. used MS to detect phosphorylated proteins in influenza A and B virus capsids. The study involved LC-MS/ MS analysis of purified viral proteins, followed by the Modification Localization Score (ModLS) tool, which enabled the mapping of phosphorylation sites. The analysis revealed 39 phosphorylation sites in influenza proteins, including the polymerase, glycoproteins, nucleoprotein, matrix protein or nuclear export protein. This demonstrated the importance of protein phosphorylation for influenza viruses in regulating virus entry and egress from infected cells, nuclear localization, and protein multimerization (Hutchinson et al., 2012) .",

Further, they are also major antigens of influenza viruses, responsible for immune recognition of the virus (Johansson et al., 1987; Johansson et al., 1989; Sriwilaijaroen & Suzuki, 2012; Virk et al., 2016) . For that reason, they undergo a constant antigenic drift (Medina et al., 2013; Herv\u00e9 et al., 2015) . Consequently, alterations in protein sequence result in an escape from immune clearance but may also mask epitopes, for example, changing the glycosylation pattern. Cruz et al. studied the glycosylation patterns of the HA protein. Researchers employed a high-energy collision dissociation (HCD) and collision-induced dissociation tandem MS (HCD/CID-MS/MS) for characterization of the site-specific profile of HA from A/New Caledonia strain (Cruz et al., 2018) . The analysis experimentally confirmed previously identified glycosylation sites and determined a broad glycan heterogeneity of HA (Sun et al., 2011) . Obtained data contributed to the understanding of influenza virus evolution. Better understanding the impact of glycosylation on influenza virus replication is highlighted by the fact that the alterations of glycosylation site locations on HA and NA proteins the H1N1 virus subtype was an important factor contributing to the pathogenicity of the 1918 pandemic strain .",

These small (approximately 50 nm in diameter) enveloped viruses include over 40 pathogenic human species of flavivirus and hepacivirus genera. Viruses egress from infected cells through a secretory pathway. During this process, viral particles undergo diverse maturation steps, such as glycosylation or proteolysis (Voisset & Dubuisson, 2004; Fields et al., 2013) . Additionally, a recent study by Rana et al. investigated the role of a capsid anchor (CA)-a hydrophobic peptide of a capsid protein, in the morphogenesis of ZIKV. Previously, CA was considered to direct the pre-membrane protein into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). However, the study showed that CA has another function, as it controls E protein stability and availability. Thus, CA expression is believed to be necessary for the production of infectious ZIKV particles (Rana et al., 2018) . Glycosylation and proteolysis also enables the incorporation of host proteins into the viral capsids, as shown for the hepatitis C virus (HCV) by Lussignol et al. Using different purification methods and LC-MS/MS, researchers identified 46 host proteins in HCV particles. Among several new host factors, a nuclear pore complex (NPC) protein was identified and further showed to participate in HCV infection (Lussignol et al., 2016) . Thus, despite the protein composition of HCV still not being well described, it is believed that cellular proteins are important components of the virus particle (Pawlotsky, 2013) . Future MS based studies on host proteins incorporated into virions should broaden current knowledge on other Flaviviridae members, such as ZIKV or West Nile virus (WNV).",

This PTM has been described as being important for the regulation of transcription and cell stress, DNA repair, and tumorigenesis (Golebiowski et al., 2009; Bertolotto et al., 2011; Kessler et al., 2012; Sahin et al., 2014) . Studying the SUMOylation of viral proteins is difficult, as this process is dynamic during infection and SUMOylated proteins are usually of low abundance. For this reason, MS has been employed as an accurate and sensitive tool to detect and identify SUMOylated viral proteins. For example, the analysis of SUMOylated proteins was performed for HSV-1-infected cells and revealed a decrease in the SUMOylation of specific antiviral proteins, which may suggest that modulation of the virus replication microenvironment enhances the infection (Sloan et al., 2015) . Similarly, Li et al. demonstrated that the EBV infection suppresses global cellular SUMOylation to facilitate the virus lytic replication. On the other hand, SUMOylation has been shown to be an important factor for influenza A virus infection. Viral proteins interact with the host SUMOylation system to facilitate their modification and, consequently, improve the replication process. SUMOylation of influenza nucleoproteins is necessary for protein intracellular trafficking, while modification of the virus nonstructural protein NS1 enables the neutralization of interferon production (Santos et al., 2013; Han et al., 2014) . Interestingly, in a more recent work by Dominigues et al., quantitative proteomics showed a unique re-SUMOylation of 63 host proteins in response to influenza virus infection. The analysis showed virus-induced remodeling of proteins involved in several processes, such as transcription, mRNA processing, and DNA damage repair (Domingues et al., 2015) .",

Here, successful analysis also bases on the proteins identification in the sample. Fortunately, current protein databases, like Uniprot or NCBI, contain protein sequences of majority of known viruses. Even if there is currently no exact protein in the database, or the amino-acid sequence is translated from genetic material instead of being experimentally verified, there is still a high probability of receiving successful protein identification, based on the homologous proteins from the evolutionary close viral strain. Fortunately, discovery of the novel viral strains usually leads to fast viral genome sequencing. As such, genomes are relatively short, and the cleavage sites of viral polyproteins to release active proteins can be predicted, it allows for fast estimation of protein composition in newly discovered virus. So the problems with appropriate protein identification based on proteomic data, which could occur for plant, fungi or even bacteria derived material, for viruses is of the minor importance.",

            "text": "The major problem with MALDI-TOF identification of viruses is related to the low quantity of the viral proteins in comparison with human, endogenous proteins in the clinical sample. Additionally, the MW of viral proteins is relatively high (>20 kDa) in contrast with the ranges used for standard microbiology diagnoses (2-20 kDa in the case of MALDI Biotyper). Moreover, viruses have to be cultivated in vitro in the specific cell line to amplify their number, so there is a risk of sample contamination by proteins and cellular debris from the cell line. Additionally, the accurate fingerprint characteristic for the specific virus has to be already deposited in the library designed for clinical use, which may be problematic due to the rapid evolution of viral pathogens. Calderaro et al. (2014) used MALDI-TOF for the detection of human polioviruses serotype 1, 2, and 3. In this study, purified viruses were subjected to MALDI analysis, and careful statistical examination of the results revealed the peaks that can discriminate between the three different serotypes (in low and high mass range). Similarly, the same comparison was made for the LLC-MK2 cells infected with mentioned viruses and for uninfected cells. This allows viral biomarkers to be found-the peaks characteristic for each cultivated serotype-and to create an in-house viral protein database. The analysis of the cells infected with the poliovirus strains isolated from clinical samples and their proper identification showed the potential of this analytical technology based on MALDI analysis for virus identification (Calderaro et al., 2016) . In the next study, the team continued the research and analyzed the most common viruses causing respiratory tract infections (influenza A and B viruses; adenovirus C; parainfluenza virus types 1, 2, and 3; respiratory syncytial virus [RSV]; echovirus; CMV; and human metapneumovirus). As previously reported, the cell culture step was included to amplify the signal, since the amount of analyte present in the sample is the major limitation of current MALDI protocols (Calderaro et al., 2016) . For each virus, the spectra for uninfected and infected samples were compared and peaks that differentiated those two in the MW range from 2,000 to 1,1500 Da were indicated. Those peaks may represent the virusspecific proteins or might be the effect of the cell line response for the infection. Hence, the list of peaks was used to create the main spectrum profile (MSP) for each reference virus. The library that consists of all the MSP was then used to identify viruses from 58 clinical samples. The signal was initially amplified in the cell culture and further analyzed. The proposed system was able to discriminate between seven different viruses. In the case of influenza, it was possible to identify the sample as human influenza virus, but distinguishing between species A and B was not possible. The same problem occurred for parainfluenza types 1, 2, and 3. Mentioned studies showed that a MALDI-based approach can be used for virus analysis, despite some limitations, and could lead to the reduction of the time and costs of the analysis in comparison with classical methods.",

Here, high resolution and high mass accuracy (of 1-5 ppm) spectra are required (Schwahn et al., 2009) . Initially, translated gene sequences for influenza HA, neuroamidase, nucleoprotein, and matrix protein M1 of all viral strains isolated from humans were used as an input (type A H1-931 sequences; type A H3-2,814; type B HA-1,057; B type Vic87-like-424; and B type Yam88-like-629 sequences). With the aid of bioinformatics tools, the masses of their theoretical tryptic peptides were obtained and matched. Then, the peptides characteristic for certain type and subtype of the virus (signature peptides) from each viral protein were chosen. The care was taken to choose the most conserved peptides for each type and subtype with the masses that differ by the largest value from theoretical tryptic peptides of all known influenza antigens whose sequences are not conserved. For example, the peptide with the mass 593.307520 (SSIMR) comes from HA and is characteristic for type A and subtype H3 of influenza virus. Such mass identified in the spectrum from the whole virus digest may correctly identify the strain and subtype but the data has to be acquired with the aid of a high-resolution mass spectrometer, for example, MALDI FT-ICR (Downard, 2013) . This approach may be used for the analysis of mixed strain proteins in the vaccines, to distinguish seasonal from pandemic influenza strains and to determine currently circulating strains, which is essential for the production of effective vaccines.",

Typically, it is a result of small yield of viral proteins in the total protein content derived from the clinical sample. While some amplify the signal by cell culturing, such an approach has severe drawbacks, as majority of clinical wildtype viruses do not replicate or replicate poorly in vitro. Thus, well known methods taken directly from immunology or molecular biology are additionally utilized for proper virus identification with the aid of MS techniques. Chou et al. (2011) coupled MALDI-TOF with the highly specific immunodetection technique. Briefly, magnetic nanoparticles coupled with antibodies specific to HA were used to enrich the sample. Subsequently, the complex was mixed with the MALDI matrix and deposited directly on the MALDI plate. Low pH of sinapic acid was responsible for the removal of the protein from the antibody by breaking the weak bonds between both molecules. The purified proteins were further analyzed. Consequently, the major advantages of the two techniques were combined and the analysis employing nanoparticles coupled with H5N2-specific antibodies were used on H5N2 influenza sample and three recombinant H5N1 samples-and proved its usefulness.",

Moreover in this case, PCR due to its nature, allows to increase the amount of the measured material (Metzgar et al., 2013) . In the microbiological analysis, the primers are designed to bind to conserved regions present in about 95% of all the bacteria and amplify heterogeneous regions between the primer sites. Such an approach is more difficult for viruses, which are characterized by higher diversity and it is not possible to design broad-range primers for general diagnostics. However, the in silico analysis of the influenza virus sequences allowed the selection of primers in conserved regions of the core gene segments that allows for detection of all known influenza viruses and distinguish >90% of all species and types (Sampath et al., 2005) . Following the RT-PCR amplification, the sample was desalted and analyzed with the electrospray. Sufficient mass accuracy of PCR amplicons allows for the unambiguous determination of the base composition (i.e., the number of As, Gs, Cs, and Ts) of each amplicon, which allows for the identification of the pathogen. The complementary nature of the DNA strains (in the case of DNA viruses) make such analysis possible at the level accuracy of around 20 ppm (see Table 1 ), but such analysis is also possible for RNA viruses (Sampath et al., 2007) . Moreover, new pathogens may be assigned to the viral family based on the conserved primers. Such primers allow for the efficient PCR from all the members of the certain family, whereas the base composition is able to indicate the new member. In the case of SARS, it was shown that this approach was able to categorize it as a new member of the coronavirus family, based on the coronavirus primers designed and tested before its emergence (Sampath et al., 2005) .",

This technology was first developed for the Department of Defense and known as TIGER (Triangulation Identification for the Genetic Evaluation of Risks) for pathogen surveillance. In its commercial form, it could be used for pathogen identification (Ecker et al., 2006) . Chen et al. (2011) used RT-PCR/ESI-MS platform (see Fig.  6 ) for identification of upper respiratory tract infections caused by RSV, influenza A and B, parainfluenza types 2 and 3, adenoviruses types A-F, coronaviruses (SARS), human bocavirus, and hMPV from nasopharyngeal aspirates in 280 retrospective samples. In the Ibis T5000 Respiratory Virus Surveillance II kit, used in this study, 16 primer pairs were distributed in a 96-well plate, in which each well contained one pair of primers, which allowed for the analysis of six patients per plate. Clinical samples collected and analyzed before, with classical clinical virological methods were used. This study proved the usefulness of the new technique, since it was characterized by 87.9% accuracy in comparison with conventional clinical virology assays, and was able to identify viruses in the samples previously unidentified. In particular, for RSV, 34 samples were positively identified with both RT-PCR/ESI-MS and clinical virology (rapid immunochromatographic tests), three samples unidentified by clinical virology were positively identified with RT-PCR/ESI-MS (the positive identification of two of them was further confirmed by another PCR-based platform) and two were misidentified with RT-PCR/ESI-MS, but their identification with clinical virology was correct. Additionally, the method was shown to be sensitive, rapid (time to detection, 8 hr) and was able to detect simultanously multiple pathogens. Sampath et al. (2007) used the technique on 92 mammalian and avian isolates representing 30 different H and N types of the influenza virus. All samples were correctly identified. Additionally, 676 human clinical respiratory specimens were tested and both: sensitivity and specificity were satisfactory (97% and 98% approximately), showed the usefulness of this approach (Sampath et al., 2007) . Moreover, using the technique it was possible to observe the evolution of the virus in time (in this case for 7 years), which allows for monitoring of the current epidemic situation. The RT-PCR/ESI-MS approach proved to be useful for detection of orthopoxviruses (Eshoo et al., 2009) , coronaviruses (Sampath et al., 2005) , and adenoviruses (Blyn et al., 2008) . The commercially available device was also successfully tested by Tang et al. (2013) on the influenza virus.",

As an example, infection with the WNV leads to massive cell death. Investigation of this process with cell viability assays, DNA fragmentation assays, annexin V labeling, and flow cytometry analysis led to the conclusion that the infection induces bax-dependent apoptosis (Parquet et al., 2001) . While the proteome analysis of the WNV infected cells led to a similar conclusion, a number of other proteins involved in this process were identified allowing for better understanding of the process. Using proteomic fractionation by 2D-DIGE analyzed by MALDI-TOF in primary rat neurons, proteins such as restin and \u03b2-amyloid were identified (Dhingra et al., 2005) , and, in the case of vero-infected cells, the 2D-DIGE was used followed by capillary LC-MS/MS and identified that programmed cell death 8 protein and apoptosisinducing factor protein (Pastorino et al., 2009) were upregulated.",

However, efforts have been made to use more natural models. Influenza A infection was studied by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis followed by MALDI-TOF using chicken brain tissue infected with H5N1 avian influenza. Novel, undescribed changes of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, neural signal transduction pathway and cytoskeletal proteins were observed (Zou et al., 2010) . A similar study with a human virus, influenza A/California/07/2009 was carried out on normal human bronchial epithelial cells isolated from three different donors. Samples were analyzed by ultraperformance liquid chromatography (UPLC) and high-resolution MS. The results obtained revealed a great diversity of responses between patients and the obtained results allowed the authors to suggest proteins important for influenza A virus replication in the natural tissue (Mindaye et al., 2017) .",

Proteomic profiles of human lung epithelial cells (A549) infected with paramyxoviruses pathogenic in humans (RSV, parainfluenza virus, human metapneumovirus, and measles virus) were obtained at different time points after infection. The cell lysates were separated with 2-D DIGE followed by nanoLC FTICR-MS. While obtained results showed some similarities between different viruses, some patterns were species-specific (van Diepen et al., 2010) . Further, coinfection of mosquitoes with Chikungunya virus and DENV were studied. While these two viruses are very different, they share the vector and the host. Further, they cause a similar disease in humans and may occur simultaneously. The mosquitos with mono-infection or coinfection were analyzed with isotope labeling by tandem mass tag and LC-MS was used. Infections with a single CHIKV or DENV virus have various effects on the mosquito's body-modify the oxidative stress pathway and energy-related pathway, respectively. Coinfection causes an energy-related pathway disorder despite the fact that CHIKV showed a higher infectivity rate (Shrinet et al., 2018) .",

After the transfection, cells were lyzed and analyzed with 2-DE and the differentially expressed spots were submitted for MALDI-TOF identification. This approach allowed to recognize thirty two proteins important for virus replication and pathogenesis.

            "text": "The concept of the interactome has been developed since 1999 when Bernard Jacq and his group created the term interactome (Sanchez et al., 1999) , defined as a branch of science combining bioinformatics and biology, which deals with the study of both the interactions and the consequences of these interactions between proteins and other molecules in the cell. Information about protein interactions is crucial for understanding cellular processes in physiological conditions and pathophysiologies. Particularly, the net of molecular interactions between viral and infected cell's proteomes are the interesting field of investigations to understand interaction of both objects. Interactome analysis can be used to build our knowledge about principles of viruses behavior in the cells, starting from the early infection phases, viral RNA or DNA processing, through cellular transcription, translation, and metabolism conquest, ending at new viral particles release and cellular death. The main goal of the interactome analysis is to show interactions between players (mainly proteins) in the examined, cellular or tissue model like: direct influence by activation or inhibition of one molecule by other, cleavage, modifications including remodeling, phosphorylation, glycosylation, and other PTMs, cooperation in the same metabolic pathway or in the same process. Results from interactome analysis are usually presented in the form of graphs of interacting proteins linked by the lines containing basic information about the nature of the interaction. It seems that interactome analysis could be one of the most powerful tools in understanding how viruses influence on the infected cells and how work the cellular defense strategies against viral conquest. Here it should be also noted that terms: interactome analysis and proteomic analysis are similar but definitely not the same. Proteomic analysis informs how the proteome of the investigated biological material (cell substructures, cells, tissues, whole organism) changes under interfering factors, while interactome analysis answers the question how individual players of the observed process influence on each other. Several methods have been introduced to identify and study protein-protein interactions (PPIs).",

            "text": "In this approach we can find cellular proteins interacting with viral ones, finding, for example, binding partners, cellular targets for viral enzymes or proteins recognizing viral DNA or RNA in the cytoplasm. In AP-MS assay bait protein is immobilized on a solid support such as magnetic beads or agarose, prey proteins are in the solution. In this case different types of baits such as specific antibodies, proteins with attached tag can be used (like: FLAG, HIS-tag, MYC, HA, GFP, streptavidin). After the affinity step proteins are digested with enzymes (proteases such as trypsin), the obtained peptides can be analyzed using the UPLC system connected with mass spectrometer. The AP-MS assay belongs to the group of libraryindependent methods, and is a universal technique allowing the usage of a wide group of molecules acting as baits. The application of a complex protocol involving cell lysis, purification, eliminates the possibility of detection spatial, temporal, weak, and transient PPIs. The development of PPI research strategies which are combined with tandem MS has become an important and powerful approach during interactome study. Various types of AP-MS assays have been introduced over time. Particular assays differ by the types of tags and the types of protein purification methods (Dunham et al., 2012) . In native AP-MS, proteins are fused with antibody and linked to the magnetic beads or agarose. The antibody binds to the selected protein and forms an immunocomplex while unbound proteins are washed away. This assay requires high purity antibodies directed exactly against the prey protein (Gillen & Nita-Lazar, 2019) . Taylor and Knipe (2004) used the native AP-MS method to identify 50 both cellular and viral proteins that interact with viral DNA-binding protein ICP8, important in the HSV-1 genome replication (Taylor & Knipe, 2004) . Gillen et al. used the AP-MS technique to study the interaction of a protein involved in inhibiting the host's immune response against the Kaposi's KSHV. Applying the a group of selected monoclonal antibodies and MS for identification, the binding sites of the ORF45-binding protein were found (Gillen et al., 2015) . As specific antibodies availability is limited in some cases, the introduction of GFP protein as a tag significantly simplified this problem. The main advantage of GFP is that the signal from this protein can confirm the expression of proteins of interest, being helpful in mapping the intracellular location of prey proteins. Munday et al. used GFP AP-MS method for investigation the cellular interactomes of the human respiratory syncytial virus L-and P-proteins. The GFP AP-MS approach showed that HSP90 and several other chaperones are involved in the replication of the viral genome by binding to polymerase and stabilizing L-protein (Munday et al., 2015) . As shown by Crow et al., during HSV-1 infection, the IFIX protein responsible for the inhibition of expression of viral genes is bound by several E3-ubiquitin ligases which degrades the host's immunity proteins. Magnetic beads connected with anti-GFP antibodies were used for affinity purifications and analyzed using MS. The identified IFIX interactions were verified by comparing biological replications of IFIX-GFP complex and pure GFP as a control using SAINT algorithms (Crow & Cristea, 2017) .",

It can be also used for finding a hybrid: viral/cellular protein complexes or analyzing of capsid assembly dynamics with types of protein involved in this process. The TAP method is based on a two-step purification procedure which increased the high-confidence interaction results, compared to standard AP methods. The use of a basic TAP tag with a high MW (21 kDa) has an adverse effect on the folding, activity and interaction of proteins; therefore, numerous modifications of the used tags have been introduced. Changing the tags to SF-TAP (streptavidin II and FLAG) resulted in a weight reduction to 4.6 kDa. Depending on the assay, different tag combinations are used (Rigaut et al., 1999; Puig et al., 2001) . Applying the TAP-MS methodology (Eberle et al., 2014) examined the effects of viral HCV nonstructural protein (NS) 5A, responsible for interference with cellular pathways and the regulation of viral RNA replication. In total, 274 proteins were identified in this experiment; the CRAPome platform was used to verify protein interactions. As a final result, 24 high confidence proteins were obtained (see Fig. 7 ). Among them, fifteen were confirmed by an independent research group in another experiment (Germain et al., 2014) . Germain et al. applied IP-MS/MS approach and ectopic expression of individually FLAGG-tagged HCV proteins such as Core, NS2, NS3/4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B. All baits were tagged at the N-terminal, only NS4B was tagged at the C-terminal. Ninety-eight proteins were identified, including 74 new proteins, not previously described in the literature. The use of IP-western blotting confirmed eleven new virus-host interactions and gene silencing during HCV-associated proteins investigation, which allowed for the identification of eleven partners that are new modulators of HCV replication (Fig. 8) .",

In the cell, proteins interacting with bait protein are biotinylated. Using biotin-streptavidin affinity approach, those biotinylated proteins can be captured. Then, isolated ones are identified by MS. The use of appropriate bioinformatics tools allows a group of proteins that interact with selected bait proteins to be obtained. This method has similar advantages and disadvantages to the previously described AP-MS technique (Roux et al., 2012) . Unfortunately, we can expect a number of nonspecific biotinstreptavidin interactions. Coyaud et al. used BioID-MS approach to create Zika interactome map. The experiment allowed the identification of 1,224 proteins interacting with the Zika virus that are involved in various processes such as translation, lipid metabolism, and vesicle trafficking (Coyaud et al., 2018) .",

Most of the experimental methods are time-consuming, expensive, require special equipment and have a high rate of false-positive results. During the past decade many computational methods have been designed to meet the challenge. Computational methods can be used to predict protein complexes based on PPI network analysis and network integration with various additional data, such as a gene function, PTMs modifications, coexpression or other introduced parameters. Various algorithms are available; however, all computational methods are based on several major assumptions such as assigning relevant scores to identified interactions, recognition of complexes by grouping available PPI networks or inclusion of additional data in the analysis and evaluation of the obtained complexes by comparison with the so-called golden standard datasets. However, so far, no existing method is able to predict efficiently the entire human, or other mammalian interactomes. Difficulties are provided by: instabilities in PPIs, the complexity of processes in which the selected protein is involved, dynamic changes that occur in cells (Rao et al., 2014) . Experimental and predicted PPIs are collected in a number of different databases which are available on-line, such as database of interacting proteins accessed at: http://dip. doe-mbi.ucla.edu (Xenarios et al., 2000) , FPCLASS (Interactions and Properties of Human Proteins) accessed at: http://ophid. utoronto.ca/fpclass/ (Kotlyar et al., 2015) , HPRD (Human Protein Reference Database) accessed at: http://www.hprd.org/, IntAct (Molecular Interaction Database) accessed at: http://www.ebi.ac. uk/intact (Hermjakob et al., 2004) , iRefWeb a web interface to protein interaction data accessed at: http://wodaklab.org/iRefWeb (Turner et al., 2010) , STRING (Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins) accessed at: http://string-db.org/ (Szklarczyk et al., 2019) , BioGrid (Biological General Repository for Interaction Datasets) accessed at: https://thebiogrid.org/ (Oughtred et al., 2019) . Reference maps of interactions have been created to better understand cellular functions. Open reading frames (Wiemann et al., 2016) enabled progress in interaction mapping. So far, several maps have been published: BioPlex (Huttlin et al., 2015) , Qubic (Hein et al., 2015) , CoFrac-15 (Wan et al., 2015) , HI_11_14 and novel generation HI-III-19 (Rolland et al., 2014) and HuRi (The Human Reference Protein Interactome Mapping Project). HuRi is the first human binary reference interactome map described by Luck et al. HuRi was generated by screening 90% of proteins coded in the human genome for binary PPIs by applying the Y2H assay. The integration of HuRi with different types of data such as the proteome, the transcriptome, and the genome allow the investigation of physiological and pathological cellular aspects.",

Classically, the vaccine is considered to induce humoral responses and provide humoral protection against viral pathogens. However, this effect is often not sufficient to control the infection and, in some cases, may result in antibody-mediated enhancement of the infection. Further, the rapid evolution of viral pathogens results in the emergence of escape mutants due to changes in highly variable viral surface proteins in terms of the primary sequence but also due to PTM (e.g., glycosylation). To develop a vaccine that can also induce cell-mediated responses it is essential to identify epitopes that are effectively presented in the context of MHC I and MHC II. Efforts to predict such epitopes in silico were undertaken, but due to the high variability of MHC molecules and unobvious rules of peptide presentation, the reliability of these methods is limited. While these computational methods do not provide reliable data, they may provide valuable inputs for subsequent experimental studies.",

In such cases, analysis of the peptidome presented in the context of the MHC starts with the expression of viral proteins or infection with the virus (Lorente et al., 2019) . Cells are then lysed, and MHC molecules are being pulled down using monoclonal antibodies allowing for the distinction of different MHC classes. Peptides associated with the MHC molecules are further released in acidic conditions and further analyzed by LC-MS/MS. Obtained data are searched against databases of viral proteomes, and peptides are mapped (Meiring et al., 2006; Weidanz et al., 2007) . Importantly, this approach also allows for mapping of epitopes that are modified posttranslationally. Exemplary, (Mulherkar et al., 2018) isolated the MHC I associated peptidome using monoclonal antibody affinity purification, and then identified peptidome compounds by nanoLC-orbitrap-MS. The authors identified and confirmed six novel MHC-I restricted epitopes that were able to bind to HLA-A2 and HLA-A24 alleles and used in vitro and in vivo methods to generate CD8+ T cells specific for each of these peptides. Wu et al. (2019) used LC-MS/MS, also in the MRM mode, and identified 21 peptides derived from the influenza A virus proteins presented by immunocompetent cells with the further estimation of the response level of T cells. In similar experiments, 25 epitopes were found from human herpesvirus 6B (HHV-6B) presented in the MHC II context. They were able to activate T cells recruiting from CD3+ and CD4+ subpopulations. In natural conditions, observed T-cells reactivity toward presented antigens, identified during the investigation, allows controlling HHV-6B infection at a reasonable level (Becerra-Artiles et al., 2019). Ternette et al. (2016) immunoprecipitated peptides bound to HLA class I complexes from HIV-1-infected primary CD4+ T cells and C8166 cell lines, and further identified those by LC-MS/MS. A similar work was previously carried out, but the researchers here used primary T-cells infected with HIV-1 for the first time, which improves the reliability of the results (Hickman et al., 2003; Yaciuk et al., 2014) . The analysis yielded a pool of epitopes, of which~35% was never reported before.",

The more sophisticated analysis was described by Xie et al. (2011) , who shows the benefits of LC-MS for characterization and monitoring of a recombinant influenza candidate vaccine formulated from purified rHA antigens. Application of this method allowed for the identification of impurities in the preparation, verification of rHA primary sequence, analysis of PTMs of the rHA and assessment of protein degradation. Similarly, Creskey et al. described an LC-MS method for the simultaneous quantification of HA and NA content in influenza vaccines (Creskey et al., 2012; McKnight et al., 2017) . The developed technique has the potential to determine the precise HA content in vaccines and to increase the accuracy of reference antigen standards. It can also be used to monitor manufacturing consistency by assessment of other protein content, as NA or chicken egg proteins. This is especially important, as the HA/NA content is one of the major parameters describing the viability of the virus; these two proteins are major targets for neutralizing antibodies. The importance of such analyses was shown by Brgles et al. (2016) who compared the protein and lipid composition of mumps viruses, showing that the research model may severely affect the vaccine contents. Furthermore, MS allows for the analysis of vaccine contaminants, as described by Lei et al. (2018) , who developed a sensitive analytical method, based on GC-MS to assess \u03b2-propiolactone content in the rabies vaccine. \u03b2-Propiolactone is used for virus inactivation. A previously described method employed gas chromatography but offered inferior parameters compared with the GC-MS method.",

Both, N-and O-glycosylation form a shield on the viral capsid proteins that is one of the most important modulators of immunogenicity, but which also affects protein folding and the consequent solubility (Varki et al., 2015) . The glycosylation pattern differs significantly between different cell types and between organisms. Even more importantly, glycosylation patterns are important for the recognition (or lack of recognition) of viral epitopes by our immune system. This is mostly relevant for heterologous expression systems, where the viral protein is immunogenic but does not elicit protective immune responses. For that reason, vaccine antigens are often produced in mammalian cells, despite the high cost and low expression efficiency. Analysis of the glycan shield is a difficult task due to the high heterogeneity of the polymers and high flexibility of sugar chains. Developments in MS allowed for the precise mapping of protein glycosylation and other PTMs, which could enhance vaccine effectiveness in the near future (Wyatt et al., 1998; Helle et al., 2010; Machiels et al., 2011; Burton & Hangartner, 2016; Cao et al., 2017; Lavie et al., 2018) .",

We can detect crosstalk between viral and cellular proteins at the basal level, investigate viral strategies, leading to the omission of cellular defense systems. In some cases, we are able to detect viral particles, directly or indirectly, in the clinical material, supporting physicians in the identification of viral infections. We can also assess how the cellular proteome changes during infection, and what the defense strategies of cells are, as well as the immunocompetent cells.
