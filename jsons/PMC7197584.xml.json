            "text": "Remdesivir has received significant attention for its potential application in the treatment of COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, a zoonotic pathogen that emerged in 2019. Remdesivir is a monophosphoramidate prodrug of an adenine nucleotide analogue. Its core is a 1\u2032-cyano-substituted adenine C-nucleoside ribose analogue (GS-441524) linked to another small molecule through an ester bond; this linkage confers better penetration into cells.1,2 From 2015, remdesivir was tested in healthy volunteers during Phase I clinical trials and it then entered Phase II studies in the context of Ebola virus disease.3,4 It soon revealed activity against SARS and MERS coronaviruses (CoVs).5,6 CoVs are positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses that infect a wide range of animal hosts. In humans they are known to cause upper respiratory tract infections and pneumonia.6 Due to the effectiveness of GS-441524 in interfering with the activity of viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases and inhibiting viral RNA synthesis, remdesivir is being developed for the treatment of COVID-19, with encouraging preliminary data.7\u20139 Concerning its metabolism, Warren et al.1 demonstrated that, upon IV administration of a 10 mg/kg dose in rhesus monkeys, remdesivir exhibited a short plasma half-life (t\u00bd = 0.39 h) with rapid systemic elimination followed by the appearance of transient systemic levels of a key intracellular intermediate alanine metabolite and more persistent levels of GS-441524 (detectable for over 24 h in plasma). Thereafter, remdesivir was rapidly distributed into PBMCs and converted within 2 h into the active nucleoside triphosphate form.1",
