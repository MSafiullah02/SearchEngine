UVGI is known to be efficacious to varying degrees in controlling the circulation of airborne infectious particles. Approximately 60% of all UVGI air disinfection systems are installed in health care facilities. According to Kowalski and Bahnfleth,1 this equates to 41% in hospitals and 19% in clinics. Until recently, most of the experimental data that led to the development of UVGI systems were decades old. Aside from anecdotal observations, little information about the actual performance of these systems in hospital rooms was available. Although UV light is known to inactivate microorganisms, limiting their ability to grow and multiply when inhaled or picked up on surfaces, there is insufficient evidence on which to base a decision to rely solely on UVGI as an engineering control for preventing health care-associated tuberculosis (TB) transmission.2\n",

For M tuberculosis, the prototype obligate inhalational pathogen, airborne droplet nuclei containing this agent can travel via air currents, aided by the ventilation system, and be spread over a wide area.

Some of these agents (eg, influenza virus) also can be transmitted by direct and indirect contact. With droplet transmission, respiratory droplets containing infectious pathogens travel directly from the respiratory tract of the infectious individual to another susceptible person through deposition on mucosal surfaces of the recipient. The distance that droplets travel depends on the velocity and mechanism by which respiratory droplets are propelled from the source, the density of respiratory secretions, environmental factors such as temperature and humidity, and the ability of the pathogen to maintain infectivity over that distance. Droplets in dry air evaporate quickly, shrink in size, and fall to the ground more slowly. The changing size of a droplet affects how it responds to airflow patterns and how quickly it settles.",

            "text": "Small pressure differences, induced by natural forces such as thermal buoyancy due to air temperature differences, the wind, or mechanical fans, can generate air flows that move air from one room to another. Air filtration aims to reduce airborne concentrations to well below infectious doses. In a hospital setting, patients lie in bed much of the time. The direction of an exhalation jet from a standing or seated person and that from a lying person can be different (eg, the latter may face up). The upward thermal plume generated by a standing or seated person is much stronger than that generated by a lying person. Thus, some differences between the behaviors of breathing flows in hospital and other indoor environments are expected. The exhalation jet from a lying patient can behave differently in different ventilation systems, and also can be affected by other factors, such as the mode of contaminant release and the thermal plume generated by the human body or other heat sources. Understanding breathing flows from a patient lying supine with different ventilation systems is useful for developing an effective ventilation method for minimizing the risk of cross-infection via airborne transmission. Droplet nuclei <5 \u03bcm in diameter exhibit a settling velocity of <1 m/h (88 feet per minute in still air, and can follow the exhalation flows as well as the ambient air flows in a hospital ward. Clinically applicable distinctions are made between short-range airborne infection routes (between individuals, generally <1 m apart) and long-range routes (within a room, between rooms, or between distant locations, generally distances >1 m). Fennelly et al15 and Bjorn and Nielsen16 set the following size definitions:\u2022Large droplet: diameter >60 \u03bcm\u2022Small droplet: diameter <60 \u03bcm\u2022Droplet nuclei: diameter <10 \u03bcm.\n",

The changing size of a droplet affects how it responds to airflow patterns and how quickly it settles. Movement of people in a room plays a significant part in disturbing airflow and also in transporting infected air from one place to another. Thus, room airflow is governed primarily, but not solely, by mechanical ventilation. Other influences include temperature, humidity, movement of personnel and patients, and equipment.

The microorganism susceptibility factor was the highest for the viruses, similar to that for fragile bacteria, but 13-20 times higher than that for endospore bacteria or fungal spores. The susceptibility factor for the viruses was higher at 55% RH than that at 85% RH, possibly because under high RH, water adsorption onto the virus surface might provide protection against UV-induced DNA or RNA damage.30\n",

            "text": "The most widely used application of UVGI is in the form of passive upper-room fixtures containing UVGI lamps that provide a horizontal layer of UV energy field above the occupied zone. These fixtures are designed to inactivate bacteria that enter the upper irradiated zone, and their efficacy is highly reliant on, among other factors, the airflow field conditions in the room. The survival probability of bacteria exposed to UV irradiance depends on the susceptibility of the target microorganism and the dose and duration of UV-C to which it is exposed.32 Lamps used to produce UV-C are located relatively high up in the room (8 ft), to prevent exposure to occupants by a specially designed fixture. There are two basic designs: a \u201cpan\u201d fixture with UVGI unshielded above the unit to direct the irradiation upward, and a fixture with a series of parallel plates that direct the irradiation outward while preventing the light from reaching the eyes or unprotected skin of the room's occupants. Germicidal activity is dependent on air mixing via convection between the room's irradiated upper zone and the lower patient care zones.32 This was confirmed in an investigation by Miller et al4 that involved installation of upper-room UVGI units and evaluation of these units' impact on culturable airborne bacteria. More than 90% of the bacteria detected were inactivated; however, the rate was lower for more-resistant bacteria and fungal spores. That investigation also clearly demonstrated that room air must be mixed for UVGI to effectively inactivate microorganisms. When warm air entered the room via a duct close to the ceiling (which can occur in the winter when the heating system is turned on), the warm air simply \u201crested\u201d on the much cooler air below, and the efficacy of the UVGI system was dramatically diminished because the microbes did not move up for exposure to the UV-C irradiation. No mixing fans were turned on during the experiment, but moderate ventilation was present.",

For example, if the ventilation rate is too high, the particles may not be sufficiently exposed to the UV-C irradiation to ensure complete inactivation, or if the ventilation system does not provide good mixing within the room, airborne particles containing microbes might not even be exposed to the UV-C irradiation.13\n",

This reinforces the need to monitor the efficacy of the lamps used in UVGI fixtures.

There are anecdotal reports that this configuration results in energy conservation and maintenance cost savings, but more rigorous study is needed to reproduce and validate these claims. Some manufacturers of these systems have also made claims of reduced incidence of health care-associated infections (HAIs) with the use of UVGI in AHUs. To date, however, there is little, if any, supportive evidence in the peer-reviewed scientific literature. Many of the published investigations rely on environmental surface or air sampling cultures or laboratory-based animal studies for inferential support. Our assessment of the available literature indicates claims of reduced HAIs from AHU-installed UVGI in health care facilities remain unfounded. There is some evidence of fewer complaints related to indoor air quality in buildings with systems containing UVGI inside the AHU.46 Levetin et al47 provided some evidence for this by demonstrating a significantly lower concentration of fungal spores on a floor of a building with an in-duct UVGI system compared with a floor in the same building without such a system. The spores recovered in the building were the same as from insulation material in the ventilation ducts, however. The authors concluded that few spores from the outdoors passed through filters in the AHUs, but that the spores developed when the HVAC system was turned on and off. Notably, they noted that \u201cas a result, we cannot say that the UV-C radiation had a direct effect on spores in the air stream. The effectiveness of UV-C lamps seemed to be localized, because visual inspection indicated there was conspicuous fungal growth in the downstream duct insulation lining.\u201d47 UV lamps also can be placed inside supply or return air ducts to disinfect the air before it is supplied to an occupied space or when recirculated.",

            "text": "An analytical model for evaluating the UV dose in steady-state conditions using the Eulerian system was proposed by Memarzadeh et al.48 Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) was used to study the efficacy of inactivation of airborne bacteria by upper-room UVGI in a test room. Several UV lamp configurations were used in the model. Compared with available experimental data, the proposed model closely predicts the percentage of particles inactivated by UVGI. The proposed model was used to study the effects of ventilation flow rate and UV fixture configuration on inactivation of airborne bacteria in a test chamber. The Lagrangian system model was also applied in the same test chamber for a similar scenario. This CFD model demonstrates that the percentage of UVGI inactivation is higher when the ventilation flow rate is lower. Increasing the ventilation flow rate from 2 to 6 ACH reduces the residence time of a pass through the UV zone from 24.7 to 8.3 seconds. In the latter case, the dosage is then only \u02dc35% of the total dose received in the former case. For upper-room UVGI to be effective, the aerosolized infectious particles must be moved from the lower part of the room, where they are produced by a person coughing or sneezing, to the germicidal zone in the upper room. Practical considerations prohibit the ideal situation of UVGI cleansing of all infectious particles in a single pass when they move through the upper-room UVGI zone. Another consideration is how rapidly microorganisms proceed through the UVGI zone. A higher frequency of ACH limits the exposure time of the infectious particles to the UVGI and thus is likely to have less effective antimicrobial activity. In practice, the effectiveness of a UVGI installation is determined by the following factors:\u2022Fixture used to house the UV-C lamp. This determines how much of the radiation discharged from the UV lamp is actually emitted from the fixture and how it is distributed.\u2022Environmental sustainability issues. Most UV-C lamps use low-pressure mercury, have a limited life span, and require environmental precautions for disposal.\u2022Distance from the UV-C lamp. The distance of airborne infectious agents from the fixture will determine the irradiance level and thus the germicidal efficacy.\u2022Airflow pattern. This affects how long the bacteria and viruses are exposed to the UV radiation.\u2022Humidity. The humidity of the atmosphere is key, because water makes the infectious agent less susceptible to damage from UV radiation. The higher the RH, the less likely an aqueous aerosol will dry out. For maximum effectiveness of UVGI, RH should be <75%.34\n\n",

The use of UVGI in orthopedic ORs was investigated by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) on January 19, 2007, in response to a formal complaint submitted after staff discovered that the UVGI lamp controls in an OR had been tampered with and set at an inappropriately high setting. After an inspection, OSHA recommended that BWH provide annual UV-C and personal protective equipment (PPE) training and medical screening for all affected employees, as well as ensure that all affected employees use the required PPE. In July 2008, BWH moved the orthopedic operating suite to an area equipped with laminar airflow and discontinued the use of UVGI for intraoperative infection control.

This design differs from upper-room devices in that the UV-C irradiation is directed down to expose the entire OR. Eye protection and other attire are required for those in the OR. The relative efficacy of direct UVGI on intraoperative air quality and prevention of infection has not been well defined, however, because studies that have examined its use did so at a variety of UV intensities in association with other infection prevention methods and surgical techniques. In addition, most studies have been observational, before\u2013after investigations, which are limited by biases and other confounding variables. Investigators have reported that UVGI is usually used not alone, but rather in conjunction with laminar airflow or body exhaust techniques, with discrepancies in wound rates under the same conditions.56 The CDC recommends against using UVGI to prevent surgical site infections.26 Overall, for general ventilation effectiveness, there is little advantage to increasing the effectiveness of the UVGI beyond 4-6 ACH. UVGI is effective when at low ACH, and its efficacy diminishes as ACH increases, because the kill rate is dependent on the duration of exposure to the UV dose.

With regard to intraoperative UVGI use, this could be achieved by substituting other infection prevention methods or technologies, such as vertical laminar air flow, before implementing direct UVGI inside the OR.53 It should be noted that a more recent design for the OR uses nonaspirating diffusers with unidirectional airflow over the surgical site but at lower velocities than traditional high-velocity laminar sir flow, thereby minimizing the risk of hypothermia.

The CFD models characterize the room and air distribution in coordination with any UVGI systems applied within the space to evaluate the effectiveness quantitatively.3 For UVGI applications in AHU and ductwork, maintenance personnel may be at increased risk even if their exposure time to the UVGI irradiation is short, because they will be in close proximity to the UVGI source.",

Experiments involving photoreactivation of microorganisms in full-scale test rooms should be conducted, as should tests of the effectiveness of UVGI on airborne bacteria over a wide range of temperatures. In real-world situations, potentially infectious droplet nuclei will vary in size and may be coated with sputum. Both of these factors can decrease the effectiveness of UVGI.

Also lacking is objective, reproducible evidence of improved energy efficiency of coils and fans with UVGI systems installed in AHUs. The efficacy of an upper-room UVGI application depends strongly on sufficient exposure of microorganisms to UV-C, which can occur if there is good mixing of upper and lower air in the room or area where installed. Furthermore, there are many marketing claims suggesting that such systems, as well as mobile systems, will protect occupants against emerging diseases such as SARS CoV, influenza, M tuberculosis, and bioterrorism agents. These claims have not been substantiated by the existing data, however, and must be weighed against the many variables discussed in this literature review.
