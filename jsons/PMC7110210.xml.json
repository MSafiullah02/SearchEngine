Some 20% of colds are caused by coronavirus infection; identical symptoms can be caused by influenza and parainfluenza viruses, adenoviruses, RSV and various enteroviruses.2 The same viruses cause descending infections of the respiratory tract, but the aetiology differs in frequency; adenoviruses are common causes of viral pharyngitis and tonsillitis, while croup (subglottic oedema due to laryngotracheitis) is particularly associated with parainfluenza virus infection.3 All these viruses can cause acute bronchitis in healthy people, and infective exacerbations in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).4 Viral RTIs are also implicated in exacerbations of asthma5 and cystic fibrosis.6 Acute bronchiolitis in infants is most commonly the result of RSV infection, but this virus is also an under-recognized cause of lower RTI in the elderly.7 Viral infection (particularly with influenza, parainfluenza and RSV) is a common cause of acute respiratory disorders leading to hospitalization in patients with chronic underlying conditions,8 particularly COPD, asthma, cardiac disease and diabetes.",

It has been shown that 90% of rhinovirus serotypes attach to a cell surface glycoprotein known as intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1). The remaining 10% probably all utilize members of the low-density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR) family.26 Two pharmaceutical companies (Boehringer Ingelheim and Bayer) have managed to produce truncated, soluble forms of ICAM-1 by genetic engineering; since free ICAM-1 will attach to the rhinovirus binding sites, the virus should effectively be \u2018neutralized\u2019 and prevented from attaching to the cell-surface receptors and initiating replication. Boehringer's product, tremacamra, has demonstrated a potent inhibitory effect on human rhinovirus in vitro.27 In phase II clinical trials, when given intranasally, tremacamra significantly reduced the symptoms of experimental rhinovirus colds, regardless of whether it was administered before or after viral challenge. There were no adverse effects, and drug administration was not associated with the development of neutralizing antibodies.28 Bayer's product, given intranasally to chimpanzees, has been shown to protect against infection on subsequent challenge with virus.29 Despite these promising findings clinical development of both projects is apparently on hold. One problem is the short residence time of intranasal medication, owing to mucociliary clearance and evacuation by sneezing and nose-blowing;30 another is the fact that protection is specific for only 90% of rhinovirus strains and not for other causes of the common cold.",

Until recently the only other agent available for the treatment of influenza was the broad-spectrum antiviral nucleoside, ribavirin. This is active against both influenza A and B in vitro; it showed low clinical efficacy in a series of trials when given orally, but by the nebulized route was shown to accelerate recovery from influenza A and B infections in infants and young children,38 although it has not been widely approved for this indication.",

The major influenza virus surface proteins are haemagglutinin and neuraminidase (sialidase). Haemagglutinin mediates binding and fusion of the viral and host cell membranes; it is the major target for neutralizing antibodies (and hence influenza vaccines) but is highly variable. Neuraminidase is essential for facilitating release of new virions from the host cell surface and preventing their aggregation. Although there is also variability in this protein, the amino acid sequence and three-dimensional structure of the enzyme's active site are highly conserved, making it a suitable therapeutic target.39 Several neuraminidase inhibitors are now in preclinical or clinical development,40 and two (GlaxoWellcome's zanamivir and Roche/Gilead's oseltamivir) have received marketing authorization.

However, resistance to zanamivir develops much less readily than it does to amantadine and rimantadine in similar experiments, and has not been shown in animal models under conditions that readily select for resistance to amantadine and rimantadine.102 The zanamivir-resistant strains appear to replicate less well in culture and are very much less infectious in mice than the wild-type virus.103 In clinical practice only one case of resistance developing to drug during therapy has been reported, in an immunocompromised child receiving prolonged treatment with zanamivir.104 Oseltamivir-resistant influenza virus has been detected in in vitro experiments and in <1% of isolates from treated patients; this is because of mutations at the active site of neuraminidase, which are associated with greatly impaired replication in vivo, suggesting that the development of resistance is unlikely to limit the clinical usefulness of this class of drugs in immunocompetent subjects,41 for therapy or prophylaxis.",

At least three mechanisms have been described in HSV, two involving mutations in the viral enzyme thymidine kinase, the other involving alterations in the viral DNA polymerase.105 Although acyclovir-resistant HSV is generally considered to have reduced virulence, cases of severe HSV pneumonia due to resistant strains of virus have been observed.106 Variants of CMV conferring multidrug resistance have also been reported.107 In general, the development of resistance has been associated with prolonged monotherapy, usually in immunocompromised patients.",

By analogy with bacterial infections one can propose a general rule that monotherapy of acute viral infections in patients with normal host defences seldom leads to the development of clinically significant resistance, whereas monotherapy of chronic infections is much more likely to, particularly in the immunosuppressed (this was discovered half a century ago with tuberculosis, and the same lesson had to be relearned in the treatment of HIV infection). Additive or synergistic effects of combinations of agents active against influenza viruses have been reported109,110 and it may be prudent to consider whether we should be prescribing combination chemotherapy for viral RTI, where the patient is immunosuppressed or treatment is likely to be prolonged. Combination therapy with ganciclovir and foscarnet has been proposed for the treatment of CMV patients with a high viral load.84 Now that we have reached a point where effective chemotherapy for most viral RTIs is a real possibility, it would be sensible to try to avoid a similar situation to that with antibacterial agents, where widespread resistance has developed largely because of inappropriate prescribing.",
