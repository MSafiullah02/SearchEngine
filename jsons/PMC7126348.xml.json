Early and precise diagnosis of pregnancy, confirmation of the number and age of fetuses and evaluation of embryonic development are prominent in these studies (Krinke 2000). Pregnancy can be determined traditionally by the presence of a copulatory plug after mating, an enlarged lower abdomen, manual palpation (Agematsu et al., 1983, Bennet and Vickery, 1970), hair loss around nipples and nipple enlargement (Bennet and Vickery, 1970, Bivin, 1986) and finally, monitoring of weight gain.",

Because of advances in ultrasound imaging technology, commercially available ultrasound systems now have the spatial and temporal resolution to obtain accurate images of rat and mouse hearts, kidneys and other organs (Coatney, 2001, Golden et al., 2012, Kobayashi et al., 2001, Srinivasan et al., 1998, Stypmann, 2007). For this reason, ultrasound is a practical method for the diagnosis of pregnancy in agouti mice (Sousa et al. 2012), staging of gestation and monitoring of intrauterine growth in rats (Brown et al., 2006, Mu et al., 2008, Nguyen et al., 2012, Pallares and Gonzalez-Bulnes, 2009, Ypsilantis et al., 2009).",

The primary aim of this study was to evaluate the use of real-time ultrasound examination in the accurate detection of rat pregnancy. According to the data obtained, D8 is the earliest day on which pregnancy could be detected, and it was based on the observation of the embryonic sacs. Detection of pregnancy is just as important as detection of non-pregnancy; it is crucial for researchers in terms of time management and planning, reducing the number of mother animals sacrificed and waiting time between experiments. Such information might prove vital to decision making in each case. In addition, ultrasound imaging of the reproductive tract during pregnancy provides valuable information relative to the developmental stage of embryos, embryo viability and progression of fetal development.",
