However, no data are available on the use of LUS in children with COVID-19 pneumonia. In this report, we describe LUS features of 10 consecutively admitted children with COVID-19 in two tertiary-level pediatric hospitals in Rome. LUS revealed signs of lung involvement during COVID-19 infection. In particular, vertical artifacts (70%), pleural irregularities (60%), areas of white lung (10%) and subpleural consolidations (10%) were the main findings in patients with COVID-19. No cases of pleural effusions were found. According to our experience, the routine use of LUS in the evaluation of children with suspected or confirmed COVID-19, when performed by clinicians with documented experience in LUS, was useful in diagnosing and monitoring pediatric COVID-19",

For this reason, several authors have suggested the use of chest computed tomography (CT) not only for diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia, but also as a screening tool for the diagnosis of COVID-19 infection in epidemic settings, as CT has been reported to have better diagnostic sensitivity than nasopharyngeal swab (Ai et al. 2020) . Conversely, Rubin et al. (2020) suggested an appropriate use of imaging, selecting those patients that might benefit from the adjunctive information contained in images. However, CT scan should not be routinely used in specific age groups, such as pregnant women (Moro et al. 2020 ) and children. Moreover, COVID-19 has become a global disease, logistic difficulties or unavailability of CT scan in low-and medium-resource settings must be considered. On the other hand, chest X-ray does not have sufficient sensitivity and specificity for detecting COVID-19 pneumonia to be considered as an alternative tool to CT scan.",

The use of LUS in the evaluation of children with respiratory infection has been approved by the ethics committees of our institutions. Informed consent was obtained from each parent/guardian. LUS was performed with a wireless pocket device connected to a probe, which were placed in single-use plastic covers (ATL Milano, Milan, Italy), as described by Buonsenso et al. (2020b) . LUS was performed in patients in the sitting position, and all lung areas were scanned, as suggested by Soldati et al. (2020a) . The two operators responsible for LUS are pediatricians with more than 5 y of experience in point-of-care ultrasound and several publications in this setting (Buonsenso et al. 2020a (Buonsenso et al. , 2020b (Buonsenso et al. , 2020c (Buonsenso et al. , 2020d Musolino et al. 2019a Musolino et al. , 2019b . The LUS patterns looked for were those described by Soldati et al. (2020a) : pleural irregularities, subpleural consolidations, vertical artifacts, patchy areas of white lung, pleural effusions.",

The Chinese Task Force for Pediatric COVID-19 proposed a severity classification, defining children as asymptomatic, mild, moderate, severe or critical cases (Dong et al. 2020) . In particular, the -moderate\u2016 stage is based on clinical criteria (pneumonia with fever and cough, in the absence of signs of hypoxemia) and/or radiologic criteria, as -some cases may have no clinical signs and symptoms, but chest CT shows lung lesions, which are subclinical\u2016 (Dong et al. 2020) . In fact, in all the large series of pediatric COVID-19 described in China (Dong et al. 2020; Lu et al. 2020; Qiu et al. 2020) , the authors routinely used CT scan to determine the severity of the disease. This has caused clinicians and researchers from the rest of the world to overuse CT scan in children, even when they are asymptomatic or pauci-symptomatic. However, to date there is no evidence that diagnosis and treatment decisions based on CT scans improve outcomes in pediatric COVID-19 infection. Moreover, CT scanning should be used parsimoniously in the pediatric age group because of their increased sensitivity to radiation exposure and because it may require sedation. In fact, international guidelines state that history and examination are the main determinants of pneumonia severity and level of care, reserving imaging to compromised children requiring admission on clinical grounds (Bradley et al. 2011) .",

In our series, only in two cases were chest Xray and CT scan were performed. The small number of patients undergoing traditional imaging is owing mainly to the long experience of our institutions in performing LUS, which is currently routine practice in children with respiratory symptoms that we see in our centers. In this context, thanks to the already proven accuracy of LUS in detecting pediatric pneumonia of any etiology (Pereda et al. 2015; Berce et al. 2019; Musolino et al. 2019; Supino et al. 2019; Buonsenso et al. 2020c) , and in the light of our observational findings, we suggest the routine use of bedside LUS in children with suspected or confirmed COVID-19. As previously suggested (Buonsenso et al. 2020b ), LUS would also allow the same pediatrician to both perform the physical examination and collect the lung images, with the advantage of reducing the exposure of other health care workers to infected patients. Moreover, a Multinational Consensus Statement from the Fleischner Society (Rubin et al. 2020 ) provided five main and three additional recommendations intended to guide medical practitioners in the use of chest X-rays and CT in the management of COVID-19. They concluded, with current knowledge, that (i) imaging is not routinely indicated in patients with suspected COVID-19 and mild clinical features unless they are at risk for disease progression; (ii) imaging is indicated in a patient with COVID-19 and worsening respiratory status; and (iii) in a resource-constrained environment, imaging is indicated for medical triage of patients with suspected COVID-19 who present with moderate-severe clinical features and a high pre-test probability of disease. These guidelines support the appropriate use of imaging and, in this context, point-of-care tools such as LUS, particularly in children, who usually have milder manifestations of COVID-19.",
