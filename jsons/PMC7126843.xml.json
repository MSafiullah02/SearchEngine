            "text": "Bioaerosols contamination caused by animals maybe a threat to both animals and public health. In particular, microorganisms or their fragments can be passively or actively released into the air in response to the changes of the hygienic situation of animal houses and meteorological conditions (Jones and Harrison, 2004). Airborne microorganisms found in swine confinement units may have a direct impact on the wellbeing of the animals in different stages of growth as well as the health of human caretakers. Many airborne pathogenic microorganisms, including viruses and bacteria, can be transmitted great distances through air flow (Brown and Hovmoller, 2002; Donaldson, 1999; Lee et al., 2007; Mims and Mims, 2004; Shinn et al., 2000). Examples include Foot-and-Mouth disease virus (Donaldson et al., 1982); severe acute respiratory syndrome virus (Eubank et al., 2004; Weiss and McMichael, 2004); influenza virus (Klontz et al., 1989; Landman and Schrier, 2004); Bacillus anthracis (CDC, 2003); and Klebsiella pneumonia (Prazmo et al., 2003). These facts illustrate the need for adequate source identification of the origins and transmission of microbial pathogens. An understanding of the origin of air pollution is paramount for assessing associated health risks as well as the actions necessary to remedy the problem.",

However, tracing the origin of airborne microorganisms is difficult using culture-based approaches. Additionally, using traditional bacterial taxonomy proves problematic when differentiating between strains that share a close genetic relationship. With the development of molecular biology, genotypic techniques were developed for studying bacterial source tracking in the field. This was initially achieved in water pollution identification (Ahmed et al., 2005; Griffith et al., 2003; Indest et al., 2005; Meays et al., 2004; van Belkum et al., 1996). Molecular methods are able to distinguish between closely related bacteria by producing DNA fingerprints that are specific for individual strains. By the comparison of these DNA fingerprints, strains from one site can be related to strains from another site. Tracing the migration of an indicator bacterium of air pollution based on comparison of their DNA fingerprints provides invaluable information. However, this technique has not yet been applied to study the origin and transmission of bioaerosols in animal houses.",

Among indicator bacteria, E. coli and Enterococcus spp. are most commonly used as the target organisms for bacterial source tracking in seawater (Bitton et al., 1983; Hanes and Fragala, 1967; Keswick et al., 1982; McFeters et al., 1974; Omura et al., 1982; Wait and Sobsey, 2001). E. coli are a dominant intestinal bacterial population in swine, colonizing the intestine distal to the stomach (Schierack et al., 2006). It is estimated that 1\u20134% of all cultivable bacteria of the colon are E. coli, and up to 1010\nE. coli bacteria can be detected in 1 g of feces (Scharek et al., 2005; Selander et al., 1987). Nonpathogenic E. coli (commensal E. coli) strains are thought to maintain the physiological milieu of the gut and support digestion as well as defend against enteric pathogens. Other E. coli strains carrying virulence genes (pathogenic E. coli), can cause severe outbreaks such as neonatal and postweaning diarrhea and edema of swine (Gyles and Fairbrother, 2004; Imberechts et al., 1992). These strains are responsible for major economic losses in pig rearing (Wieler et al., 2001). In addition, E. coli is a common microorganism in the air environment, particularly in animal houses and their surroundings (Duan et al., 2006; Northcutt et al., 2004; Zucker et al., 2000). Hojovec et al. (1977) evaluated the air quality in poultry houses using E. coli as an indicator. In this experiment, E. coli was used as indicator bacterium to study the origin of bioaerosol and its transmission to the ambient air of swine houses.",

In E. coli there are 30\u201350 copies of ERIC sequences, and ERIC units tend to occur singly, including a potential stem-loop structure, and are located in non-coding regions (Hulton et al., 1991; Martin et al., 1992; Sharples and Lloyd, 1990). REP sequences are present from 500 to 1000 base pairs in length and are found in clusters in which successive copies are found in alternate orientations (Gilson et al., 1984; Martin et al., 1992; Stern et al., 1984). And REP-PCR is a widely used method for DNA typing analysis and has been shown to successfully differentiate strains of Bartonella (Rodriguez-Barradas et al., 1995), Citrobacter diversus (Woods et al., 1992), Enterobacter aerogenes (Georghiou et al., 1995), Burkholderiaa cepacia (Hamill et al., 1995), Salmonella enterica (Johson and Calbots, 2000) and E. coli (Dombek et al., 2000). So, the ERIC-PCR and REP-PCR techniques have been devised for characterization of bacteria and are widely employed to distinguish species, strains and serotypes (Chansiripornchai et al., 2001; de Moura et al., 2001; Lupsiki and Weinstock, 1992; van Belkum, 1994; Versalovic et al., 1994). McLellan et al. (2003) found that ERIC-PCR and REP-PCR yielded comparable results using E. coli as the target organism. In this experiment, our results showed that the discriminatory power yielded by the techniques of ERIC-PCR and REP-PCR was very well to differentiate between strains isolated from different sites in each swine house.",

As illustrated in Fig. 1, Fig. 2, Fig. 3, Fig. 4, Fig. 5, the grouping of REP-PCR fingerprints was highly similar with those obtained from ERIC-PCR. This showed that the two approaches yield an analogous taxonomic resolution, suggesting that the two approaches can be fully applied for the study of the transmission of bioaerosols from animal houses to their environments. From the results, we can see that 48.8% E. coli strains isolated from indoor air samples had \u2a7e90% similarity with corresponding strains isolated from fecal samples in each swine house. That is, the fecal strains could be aerosolized and spread to the indoor air. In contrast, however, 51.2% of E. coli isolated from indoor air samples had a far genetic distance (<90% similarity) from the fecal samples. This observation might result from the following reasons: (i) the strains isolated from the indoor air originated from other sources (e.g. feed, water, etc.); (ii) these strains are present in the fecal samples, but were not isolated from the fecal samples and could not be compared.",
