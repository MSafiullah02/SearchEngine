            "text": "The records database in the Specialized Infectious Diseases Laboratory at Colorado State University was searched between January 2002 and May 2004 for feline serum sample submissions that listed neurological disease as a presenting complaint. All cases with adequate serum available for further testing were accepted (group 1). The submission paperwork was retrieved and each of the cats was further characterized by one of the authors (LP); the neurological complaints divided into seizures or other neurological signs. Two control groups were also selected. Group 2 consisted of sequentially selected, clinically ill cats for which adequate sample was available for additional testing, the presenting complaint was non-neurological, and the sample period encompassed at least a 1 year period. Group 3 consisted of sequentially selected, healthy cats for which adequate sample was available for additional testing, and the sample period encompassed at least a 1 year period. Age, breed, sex, and state were recorded for each case. Each sample had been previously submitted for infectious disease testing; Toxoplasma gondii, FeLV, FIV, and coronavirus were most common. Each sample had been stored at \u221220 \u00b0C or \u221280 \u00b0C until thawed and assayed in an IgG ELISA for the detection of antibodies against B henselae (Lappin et al 2000). In this ELISA, a 1:64 dilution of positive control, negative control, and suspect sera are each assayed in quadruplicate wells and the mean absorbances calculated. The mean absorbance values were converted to %ELISA units by use of the following formula: (test sample mean absorbance minus the negative control sample mean absorbance)/(positive control sample mean absorbance minus the negative control sample mean absorbance) multiplied by 100. An individual cat was considered positive for B henselae antibodies if the %ELISA value was greater than the mean %ELISA value plus 3SD of the pre-inoculation samples for a group of 26 specific pathogen-free cats (10 kittens at 8 weeks of age and 16 cats at 3 years of age). Positive suspect serum sample results were converted to estimated titers ranging from 1:64 to 1:4096 by comparing to a standard curve.",

Thus, the state of origin of the case was used to classify each cat as high risk or low risk of exposure to C felis as previously described (Jameson et al 1995). Samples were categorized as being from areas with low (Alaska, Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah, Wyoming) or high flea prevalence (all other states). Age, flea risk, clinical manifestation, and B henselae titer were entered into a spreadsheet and analyzed by use of a commercially available statistical software package (SAS, SAS Institute, Cary, NC, Version 9.1). Relationships between B henselae serological status (positive or negative) and clinical presentations were first assessed by Fisher's exact test. Additionally, logistic regression was used to assess the influence of serological status, age and risk of flea exposure on clinical presentation. Relationships between B henselae titer magnitude and clinical manifestations were assessed by determining median titers for each group and evaluated with Wilcoxon's rank sum test. Significance was defined as P\n < 0.05.",

Thus, one of the major limitations to this study is the lack of a consistent neurological examination between cases. And so there is the possibility that some cats in group 1 did not have neurological disease and some cats in group 2 had neurological disease which potentially could have influenced the results. Encephalopathy, with several classical manifestations including headaches, confusion, excitability, combative behavior, tonic-clonic seizures, status epilepticus and coma (Carithers, 1985, Carithers and Margileth, 1991, Armengol and Hendley, 1999, Weston et al., 2001) is the most common neurological complication of CSD in man, occurring in 2\u20133% of affected patients (Carithers 1985). Because these different clinical signs of encephalopathy can be hard to categorize in cats, we felt subdivision of the cases into categories other than seizures or other neurological manifestations would be potentially inaccurate. In future prospective studies, cases should be solicited from a limited number of veterinary neurologists to allow for more accurate case classification which may aid in detection of clinical disease associations.",

Because some experimentally inoculated cats develop neurological disease after inoculation with B henselae, it is likely the same syndromes occur in client-owned cats as well (Kordick and Breitschwerdt, 1997, O'Reilly et al., 1999, Malgorzata et al., 2000). However, in this study, the prevalence of Bartonella species antibodies in serum of cats with neurological manifestations of disease (group 1) was less than a group of clinically ill cats without neurological signs (group 2) and a group of healthy cats (group 3). In another study of sick cats in North Carolina, prevalence of B henselae antibodies was similar between cats with and without neurological dysfunction (Breitschwerdt et al 2005). Results of these studies emphasize how difficult it can be to diagnose clinical bartonellosis in individuals based on the result of a single serological test result.",

For example, antigens from culture derived B henselae were used in the ELISA used in this study. However, in titration experiments, sera from a number of cats currently polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay positive for B clarridgeiae DNA but not B henselae DNA in blood were positive in the ELISA described herein. To our knowledge, B clarridgeiae has not been associated with clinical illness in cats. It is now apparent that some humans with suspected B henselae associated illness were actually infected by B koehlerae (Avidor et al 2004). In the future, prospective studies evaluating for potential disease associations with Bartonella species should use techniques like PCR assay or culture with subsequent genotyping to allow for more stringent organism identification (La Scola and Raoult, 1999, Sander et al., 1999, Fenollar and Raoult, 2004).",

For example, B henselae antibody titers of varying magnitudes were commonly detected in healthy children in Italy (Massei et al 2004), healthy veterinarians in Japan (Kumasaka et al 2001), and people with CSD (Fournier et al 2002). In the study described here, median Bartonella species antibody titers were greater in cats with seizures than in cats with other neurological disease. However, the median Bartonella species antibody titer was also greater in healthy cats than cats with seizures. These results suggest that titer magnitude in cats cannot be used alone to document clinical disease associated with Bartonella species infection.",

Cerebrospinal fluid analysis findings in people with neurological CSD are variable and non-specific (Carithers, 1985, Carithers and Margileth, 1991, Noah et al., 1995). However, detection of Bartonella species antibody production by ocular tissues and microbial DNA has been amplified from aqueous humor of cats with uveitis (Lappin et al 2000). Use of these techniques with cerebrospinal fluid of cats may prove to be of benefit in the diagnosis of neurological bartonellosis.",
