            "text": "In September of 2012, a novel coronavirus was discovered in a patient suffering from a severe acute respiratory disease termed Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) (Zaki et al., 2012), subsequently the virus was renamed MERS-CoV (de Groot et al., 2013). Thus far, 26 nations have reported over 1600 MERS cases with a case fatality rate of 36% (http://www.who.int/emergencies/mers-cov/en/). Fortunately, MERS-CoV has yet to demonstrate sustained human to human transmission. However, given the estimated 2.5 million pilgrims to the MERS-CoV endemic region for the Hajj, MERS-CoV represents a continued global health risk. Despite a substantial response by health agencies, MERS-CoV infections continue and have spread geographically due to travel as evidenced by the recent outbreak in the Republic of Korea (186 cases with 36 deaths), and single cases in Thailand, Philippines, and China (http://www.who.int/emergencies/mers-cov/mers-cov-republic-of-korea-and-china-risk-assessment-19-june-2015.pdf?ua=1). Unfortunately, the definitive reservoir has yet to be identified, although camels are heavily implicated and may at least serve as an intermediate host. If so, then camels may provide an intervention point to prevent human disease (Adney et al., 2014, Gossner et al., 2014, Khalafalla et al., 2015, Yusof et al., 2015). If MERS-CoV was able to establish efficient human to human transmission and maintain pathogenicity, then the increased number of patients and the special care they require could rapidly place a strain on healthcare resources. Treatment thus far has been supportive with reports of patients placed on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, commonly known as ECMO, to maintain their health (Pebody et al., 2012). To date, no MERS-CoV-specific countermeasures or treatment programs have been developed.",

To date, three murine models have been reported that express the MERS-CoV receptor, human dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4 or CD26) in the respiratory track through adenovirus transduction of the airway (Zhao et al., 2014) or construction of transgenic or humanized mice through genomics techniques (Agrawal et al., 2015, Pascal et al., 2015). These mouse models serve complementary roles in the evaluation of medical countermeasures (Channappanavar et al., 2014a, Channappanavar et al., 2014b), MERS-CoV respiratory disease (Agrawal et al., 2015) and lung pathology (Pascal et al., 2015). Common marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) have also been evaluated as a MERS model (Falzarano et al., 2014, Johnson et al., 2015). They develop limited disease as shown by histopathological analysis, radiological analysis, and qRT-PCR evidence of virus replication in the lung, but do not develop a severe respiratory disease that faithfully replicates the human condition.",

The nonhuman primate (NHP) (Macaca mulatta) model of MERS has been described by two groups (de Wit et al., 2013, Yao et al., 2014). In this model, exposure of rhesus monkeys to MERS-CoV leads to a transient lung infection that results in variable lung pathology consisting of inflammatory infiltrates as well as transient radiological lung findings. However, to date, there are no reports of using this model to evaluate a new anti-MERS drug. There is renewed interest in the use of monoclonal antibodies to treat viral infections (reviewed in (Bossart et al., 2009, Marasco and Sui, 2007, Qiu and Kobinger, 2014, Shadman and Wald, 2011). We and others have identified neutralizing antibodies against MERS-CoV (Jiang et al., 2014, Tang et al., 2014, Ying et al., 2015). In this study we describe intratracheal inoculation of rhesus monkeys with MERS-CoV Jordan-n3/2012 as well as a pilot study demonstrating efficacy of 3B11-N, a human monoclonal antibody against MERS-CoV spike protein to reduce lung pathology following MERS-CoV infection.",

The second part was evaluation of the anti-MERS-CoV monoclonal antibody 3B11-N. In total, five groups of NHPs were evaluated as shown in\nFig. 1. Computed Tomography (CT) was chosen over standard radiography because 1) CT is quantifiable, which allows for direct comparisons between groups with reduced bias, and 2) CT provides a 3-dimensional representation of the region of interest whereas standard radiography compresses 3- dimensional images into 2 dimensions and may misrepresent pathology. In this study, two subjects (Group 1) were inoculated with \u03b3-irradiated 5\u00d7106 PFU MERS-JOR and received periodic bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) to determine the impact of the infection procedures and viral antigens would have on lung pathology as measured by CT. Group 2 consisted of two subjects that received 5\u00d7106 PFU MERS-JOR by intratracheal (IT) inoculation without BAL to determine the impact of virus on lung pathology and two subjects (Group 3) that received 5\u00d7106 PFU of infectious MERS-JOR with periodic BAL to determine the impact of BAL on the observed lung pathology. Group 2 and 3 subjects were re-challenged at days 26 and 88 to determine if there was immune enhanced disease and to match pathology findings with radiology findings; BALs were also performed on Group 3 subjects following re-challenge. Group 4 consisted of three subjects that received 5\u00d7106 PFU of infectious virus by IT inoculation preceded by treatment with 311B\u2010N 1 day prior to infection. Finally, Group 5 was comprised of 3 subjects that received 5\u00d7106 PFU of infectious virus by IT inoculation preceded by treatment with an antibody against HIV-1 (4E10-N, (Zwick et al., 2001)) 1 day prior to infection as a non-specific control antibody.",

The total lung capacity was refined by adding pathological tissues into the lung regions of interest (ROIs) and pathology percentage was computed using total lung capacity as a disease severity index. Averages of these values were compared between the groups (\nFig. 3A). To adjust for the differences in total lung volume between the subjects the percent of pathologic lung volume was also calculated (Fig. 3A). These data also support a mild respiratory disease.

We also demonstrate that the 3B11-N monoclonal antibody against MERS-CoV significantly reduces virus-induced lung pathology as measured by CT when compared to untreated subjects, thus warranting further investigation as a potential MERS-CoV countermeasure. The present study varies from previous studies of MERS-CoV in rhesus monkey due to 1) the use of MERS-JOR, 2) CT for evaluating structural changes in the lung, 3) comparison of subjects that received BAL and those that did not, 4) subjects were not euthanized at early timepoints post-infection to evaluate pathology and viral loads, and 5) subjects were re-challenged to determine if immune enhanced infection may occur. MERS-JOR infection of rhesus has not been previously described and the differences observed between our study and Munster and Yao\u05f3s (Munster et al. 2013, Yao et al., 2014) indicated that other MERS-CoV isolates should be evaluated to determine if an improved model could be developed.",

A difference between Group 2 and Group 3 animals was observed and is likely due to continued BAL procedures that were performed on Group 3 subjects. Furthermore, the comparison of Group 3 subjects to the other groups suggest that procedures such as BAL likely induce increased lung pathology that may confound study results, which has been described previously (Haley et al., 1989, Von Essen et al., 1991). de Wit et al. performed BAL on days 1, 3, and 6 post-infection and Yao et al. did not perform BAL and less respiratory disease was observed by radiography by Yao et al., supporting our findings that BAL does influence radiological findings.

We have demonstrated that pre-treatment with a monoclonal antibody against the MERS-CoV spike protein significantly reduced severity of lung pathology when compared to untreated subjects. Lung pathology in 3B11-N treated subjects was roughly 10% of that in control antibody treated subjects and roughly equal to subjects that received \u0194-irradiated virus and BAL (Group 1). The lack of statistical significance between the control antibody and 3B11-N is likely due to the small and variable volume of lung pathology induced by MERS-CoV and the small group size (n=3). The p-value of the comparison between 3B11-N to 4E10-N treatments nearly reached significance (p=0.051) which further supports that larger group sizes may provide statistically significant differences. This pilot study paves the way for experiments utilizing larger group sizes with varying treatment strategies to include post exposure treatment and \u201ctrigger to treat\u201d based on CT findings. Such experiments would also need to include control groups of \u201cmedia only\u201d and \u0194-irradiated virus to account for the possibility that \u0194-irradiated virus may also induce an inflammatory response.",

Animal models that faithfully mimic human disease need to be developed for identification and evaluation of potential countermeasures as well as understanding disease processes. Rhesus monkeys and marmosets do not develop the severe disease that is observed in humans (Munster et al. 2013; Yao et al., 2014; Falzarano et al., 2014; Johnson et al., 2015), but to date are the available nonhuman primate models. Small animal models, particularly mice, have been explored as well. These models provide greater accessibility than NHP models and the availability of knockout mice, transgenic mice, and transduction models provide opportunities to study specific disease processes. Thus far, the two most commonly studied isolates are MERS-EMC and MERS-JOR. Other isolates should be evaluated in the available models to identify isolates that may provide a higher degree of pathogenesis in the relatively restricted hosts evaluated to date so that an improved model of this emerging viral pathogen can be developed.",

Subsequently, a random-forest based machine-learning algorithm was applied for determining the volume and spatial extent of the pathological regions and added into the lung ROI. Mainly, ground glass opacities and consolidations were observed as pathological tissues; therefore, the machine-learning algorithm was tuned to optimally detect these abnormal imaging patterns apart from normal tissues. Once normal and all pathological tissues were identified, percent of the abnormal lung was computed through total pathological tissue volume divided by the total lung capacity. Airways and airway walls were also delineated using a graph-based segmentation algorithm (Xu et al., 2013) for exploring whether the infection reaches and affects the airways; however, we did not find significant volume or density changes either on airways or airway walls. Similar routine was used to evaluate candidate vaccine approaches in MERS-CoV (Wang et al., 2015).",
