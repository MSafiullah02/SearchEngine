An outbreak in 2002\u20132003 affected more than 8000 patients in over 30 countries across five continents. In some areas, the mortality reached as high as 10% of the infected patients (WHO). Viruses isolated from SARS patients have been confirmed to be a new type of coronavirus that is responsible for the outbreak Enserink and Normile, 2003, Guan et al., 2003, Lai, 2003, Yan et al., 2003. Coronaviruses are large enveloped, positive-stranded RNA viruses that cause diseases in human and animals Chiu, 2003, Martina et al., 2003. They have the largest genomes in all RNA viruses and replicate by a unique mechanism, which results in high frequency of recombination. Similar to influenza virus, coronaviruses are highly mutable and therefore the infection is extremely difficult to treat (Knipe and Howley, 2001).",
