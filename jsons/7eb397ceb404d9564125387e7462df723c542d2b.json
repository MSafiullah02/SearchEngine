            "text": "The molecular mechanisms underlying the pathogenesis of human coronavirus OC43 (HCoV-OC43) infection are poorly understood. In this study, we investigated the ability of HCoV-OC43 to antagonize the transcriptional activation of antiviral response elements. Methods: HCoV-OC43 structural (membrane M and nucleocapsid N) and accessory proteins (ns2a and ns5a) were expressed individually in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK-293) cells. The transcriptional activation of antiviral response elements was assessed by measuring the levels of firefly luciferase expressed under the control of interferon (IFN)-stimulated response element (ISRE), IFN-\u03b2 promoter, or nuclear factor kappa B response element (NF-\u03baB-RE). The antiviral gene expression profile in HEK-293 cells was determined by PCR array. Results: The transcriptional activity of ISRE, IFN-\u03b2 promoter, and NF-\u03baB-RE was significantly reduced in the presence of HCoV-OC43 ns2a, ns5a, M, or N protein, following the challenge of cells with Sendai virus, IFN-\u03b1 or tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1. The expression of antiviral genes involved in the type I IFN and NF-\u03baB signaling pathways was also downregulated in the presence of HCoV-OC43 structural or accessory proteins. Conclusion: Both structural and accessory HCoV-OC43 proteins are able to inhibit antiviral response elements in HEK-293 cells, and to block the activation of different antiviral signaling pathways.",

The induction of type I IFN is initiated by molecular sensing of viral RNA by pattern recognition receptors such as TLR, RIG-I, and MDA5 [10] . The adaptor protein MAVS mediates the signals from RIG-I and MDA5 to activate the kinases TBK1 and IKK\u03b5, which in turn phosphorylate IRF3 and IRF7 transcription factors [11] . IRF3 and IRF7 dimerize to undergo nuclear translocation and initiate the transcription of type I IFN. The adaptor proteins MYD88 and TRIF mediate signals from TLRs and activate IRAK1, TRAF6, and the aforementioned kinases [12] . The IRFs along with nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) can then be phosphorylated to translocate into the nucleus and establish the transcription of type I IFN by binding cognate sites on the IFN-\u03b2 promoter [12] . NF-\u03baB specifically binds to the NF-\u03baB response element (NF-\u03baB-RE) to regulate the expression of pro-inflammatory and cell survival genes [13] .",

The SARS-CoV N protein can activate NF-\u03baB-RE in Vero E6 cells [32] . However, SARS-CoV N protein inhibits the promoter activity of ISRE, IFN-\u03b2 promoter, and NF-\u03baB-RE in 293T cells [17] . Our study showed that the transcriptional activity of ISRE, IFN-\u03b2 promoter, and NF-\u03baB-RE was inhibited in the presence of HCoV-OC43 N protein. Lai et al. [33] showed that after 24 h of TNF-\u03b1 treatment, HCoV-OC43 N protein potentiates NF-\u03baB expression in 293T cells by binding its inhibitor, miRNA 9. miRNA 9 expression is induced by stimuli which activate NF-\u03baB, such as TNF-\u03b1 and lipopolysaccharide [34] . Unfortunately, the authors did not show results for NF-\u03baB-RE activation after 6 h of TNF-\u03b1 treatment, the optimal time for NF-\u03baB-RE activation in our experiments. The influenza A virus that is known to inhibit IRF3, AP-1, and NF-\u03baB activation [35, 36] was shown to upregulate the miRNA 9 expression [37] . We speculate that the expression of N protein results in transient downregulation of NF-\u03baB expression through downregulation of its mediators (e.g., TLR7, MYD88, TRADD), leading to early inhibition of NF-\u039aB-RE activation, and that the accumulation of miRNA9 in cells with time will lead to the formation of N protein/miRNA 9 complex and the removal of inhibition on NF-KB and NF-KB-RE.",
