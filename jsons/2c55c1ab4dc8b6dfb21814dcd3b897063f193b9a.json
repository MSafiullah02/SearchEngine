On 7 January 2020, Chinese authorities identified the causative agent to be a new type of coronavirus. As the number of cases began to increase, in January 2020, China instituted the lock-down of several Hubei cities. The virus continued to spread to the other provinces of China, with the death toll in China at the end of January recorded as 170. Imported cases of coronavirus infection were soon detected in several neighbouring countries such as South Korea, Japan, Thailand and Singapore within the same month. The first case of imported coronavirus in Singapore was identified on 23 January 2020. On 11 February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the disease caused by the virus (SARS-CoV-2) would be called COVID-19. On 15 February 2020, a Chinese tourist died in France as a result of the virus, the first death in Europe. The WHO declared COVID-19 a pandemic on 11 March 2020. As of 14 March 2020, the global number of confirmed infected cases has exceeded 142,000, with more than 130 countries reporting cases, and the global reported death toll has risen to more than 5300.",
