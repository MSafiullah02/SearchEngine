            "text": "Three-dimensional structure determinations based on cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) have become a standard tool of structural biology in recent years. Just as in the practice of crystallography (Rodgers, 2001), the technique of freezing samples in vitrious ice for EM analysis (Baker et al., 1999, Dubochet et al., 1988) has made it possible to obtain two-dimensional projected images with minimal distortion or artifacts. Provided there is a plentiful supply of near identical frozen particles in random orientations, these projections can be combined to form three-dimensional images. The resolution of these images has been improving rapidly, largely because of improvements in reconstruction techniques (Tao and Zhang, 2000, van Heel et al., 2000). In particular, efforts have centered on the accurate determination of the contrast function that corrects the two-dimensional images for the experimental out-of-focus distance, the accurate determination of the relative orientation of the projected images, and the use of a far greater number of particles. As a result, it is now quite usual for cryo-EM image reconstructions to have an estimated resolution of 10 \u00c5, and sometimes even as good as 7 \u00c5, with expectations of reconstructions going to 4 \u00c5 (Henderson, 2004, van Heel et al., 2000) soon. These improvements have made it possible to accurately fit atomic resolution crystal structures of molecular fragments into the lower resolution EM density to produce \u201cpseudo\u201d atomic structures of the complex (Figure 1\n). Although the fitting procedure is frequently done \u201cby hand\u201d using visual graphics programs, such as O (Kleywegt et al., 2001), there are considerable advantages in performing these operations by computer (Jiang et al., 2001, Roseman, 2000, Rossmann et al., 2001, Volkmann and Hanein, 2003, Wriggers and Chac\u00f3n, 2001, Wriggers et al., 1999) in order to establish the uniqueness and quality of the fit (especially at resolutions lower than about 15 \u00c5) and to determine whether the crystal structure can be treated as a rigid model or should be modified by permitting some bending or hinge motions.",

The larger and structurally more complicated the molecule or molecular assembly, the less likely it is that the molecule can be packed into a crystal, such that the surface area of contact between molecules is large compared with the total area of the molecular assembly itself. An obvious example is bacteriophage T4 (Figure 2\n). This phage has a dsDNA genome consisting of about 168 kbp, representing about 300 open reading frames of which about 40 code for structural proteins, many of which occur in multiple copies in the virion. Crystallization can also be difficult or impossible when the structure of interest has components that are flexible, implying that each structure has specific regions on its surface that vary from molecule to molecule. This might be caused by a hinge between domains (e.g., the fibers of T4; Figure 2) or a surface carbohydrate moiety (Figure 3\n).",

An example is the complex of a virus with its receptor and accessory receptors. A virus must not only recognize its cellular receptor, but the recognition event has to initiate virus entry and possibly virus uncoating. For instance, the complex of human rhinovirus 14 with ICAM1 (Figure 3; Kolatkar et al., 1999) was formed by incubating the virus with the two-domain receptor for a few hours and then freezing within a few minutes before the virus degraded, but long enough to permit complex formation.

For cryo-EM, it is only necessary to have enough sample to collect sufficient data to produce a reconstruction which might amount to 105 particles or so to attain resolutions of better than 10 \u00c5, perhaps. In comparison, a minimally sized crystal with dimensions of about 200 \u03bcm in each direction would contain about 1010 particles of 1,000 \u00c5 diameter. A further advantage of cryo-EM is that sample purity is not as critical as is required for crystallization, as images of the molecular assemblies being studied can be selected from the micrographs even when mixed with other molecules. A number of examples come to mind. With present techniques, purified flaviviruses, the less stable types such as dengue virus (Figure 5\n) and especially yellow fever virus, are often mixtures of good and broken particles that would be impossible to crystallize. Or, in studying virus-receptor or virus-antibody complexes, it is often necessary to have excess ligand present to assure saturation of all sites on the virus. Another frequent occurrence is that there are two or more different modifications of the sample under study that are difficult to separate.",

This process was used in the analysis of dsDNA packaging into the proheads of the small tailed \u03d529 phage (Figure 6\n; Morais et al., 2001, Simpson et al., 2000). The packaging process was stopped by freezing about 2 minutes after initiation. The original micrographs showed roughly two types of particles, those that appeared to be empty and those that appeared to be partially filled. Separate image reconstructions showed not only the partial presence of DNA in the fuller particles, but also a significantly different and larger structure around the unique vertex containing the portal for DNA entry. It was concluded that the additional density is due to the ATPase (gene product 16) known to be essential for DNA packaging. The portal vertex density could be fitted with the crystal structure of the dodecameric \u201cconnector\u201d (Simpson et al., 2000), the central component of the DNA-packaging machine, and the difference density of the structural prohead RNA (pRNA; Figure 7\n). The resultant model has provided a hypothesis on how the packaging motor works (Simpson et al., 2000).",

Although this is also required for single-particle reconstructions, the tomographic technique does permit the reconstruction of three-dimensional images to low resolution (Baumeister and Steven, 2000, Grunewald et al., 2003). In this technique, the EM grid is exposed to various tilt angles, allowing for the collection of a series of images projected in different directions for the particles on the grid. The limitations are, however, that the exposures have to be few and low dose to avoid excessive radiation damage, resulting in low-resolution reconstructions. Nevertheless, there is promise of three-dimensional analyses of whole cells and pleomorphic, membrane-enveloped viruses, such as influenza or coronaviruses.",

            "text": "The limit of resolution for which actual data are available on a particular micrograph or for a specific particle can be assessed by looking at the averaged Fourier transformed distribution (van Heel et al., 2000). However, final resolution of a particular reconstruction depends on many factors, including the completeness with which the Fourier transform (reciprocal space) of the reconstructed image is sampled. Each two-dimensional particle image is equivalent to a central section of reciprocal space skewed perpendicular to the direction of projection. Thus, the first few images in random orientation rapidly sample the central, low-resolution volume of reciprocal space. As the number of images is increased, the probability of sampling an extensive volume at higher resolution increases (Figure 8\n). Although higher symmetry implies that fewer images would be required to attain a desired resolution, the larger the particle (corresponding to a smaller reciprocal cell), the greater will be the need for more particles (Rossmann et al., 2001). Another factor that impacts the quality of the reconstructed image is the out-of-focus distance used in recording the micrograph. This distance determines the resolution at which the contrast transfer function has amplitude close to zero. Thus, if all images were taken at the same out-of-focus distance, there would be shells of resolution where there would be few effective data. Hence, it is necessary to combine images taken at various out-of-focus distances. In addition, the higher resolution data can be emphasized by the application of an \u201cinverse temperature factor\u201d correction. Not surprisingly, as resolution limits are being pushed outward, the need for techniques that automatically select particles on micrographs become essential (Glaeser, 2004, Nicolson and Glaeser, 2001, Zhu et al., 2004).",

These need to be suitably weighted to produce a combined overall criterion of best fit. In order to place the different criteria onto equivalent scales, it is convenient to express each measure as a dimensionless quantity representing the number of standard deviations a specific fit is above average. The standard deviations themselves can be determined by analyzing a series of random fits (Rossmann et al., 2001). Examples of different criteria are the mean height of density at their fitted positions, the number of steric clashes between symmetry-related molecules or between different molecules, the number of atoms that are outside the boundary of the available density, and the chemical sense of the interaction between fitted fragments. Other types of information can also be considered, such as the distance between known positions in the density map (e.g., carbohydrate sites found in difference maps; Zhang et al., 2002) and the corresponding residue position in the fitted structure, or the distance between the carboxy-terminal C\u03b1 atom of one domain and the amino-terminal C\u03b1 atom of the following, independently fitted, domain. The greater the number of consistent restraints, the greater is the probability of an accurate fit. However, as the resolution of the map improves, more reliance can be placed on the shape of the density as implemented in the Situs program (Wriggers et al., 1999).",

It was found that the known crystal structures could be fitted about equally well to both the hexagonal and star-shaped structures, implying that the conformational change is primarily produced by the individual proteins slipping and sliding over each other, without themselves undergoing any major conformational alteration. Although the fitting was fairly straightforward, nevertheless the hybrid technique of combining crystal and cryo-EM data is unlikely to be able to detect small conformational changes in the main chain and especially in side chain structures.

The carbohydrate positions (crosses) had been determined from difference maps between wild-type and deglycosylated virus. After the E1 molecules had been fitted, the density at all grid points in the map that were within 4 \u00c5 of each atom in E1 was set to zero, leaving the density of E2. Hence, the three E2 molecules (cyan, brown, and blue) were shown to be long and thin (Zhang et al., 2002).",

The head is attached to the tail, a highly specialized and extremely efficient phage component required for infecting the E. coli host. The hexagonally shaped baseplate is situated at the distal end of the tail. The baseplate coordinates the movement of the six long tail fibers that initially sense the presence of the host, the short tail fibers that unfold from underneath the baseplate to firmly anchor on the E. coli surface, and the tail sheath surrounding the tail tube that contracts, thereby ejecting DNA into the host. The numbers identify the gene products of the various proteins that are in the assembled virion. It would be difficult to place this complex virus into a well-packed crystal lattice both because of its shape and because of the variably angled fibers (Eiserling and Black, 1994; Leiman et al., 2003).",
