Indeed, the sex dependent susceptibility to COVID-19 infection, is a result of many not yet identified factors. These however, should be recognized as soon as possible, in order to improve an accurate management of the disease.Fig 1\n.",

Both of these members of 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors are used to reduce prostate volume pharmacologically (3). Therapeutic effect is mediated by decreasing intraprostatic level of DHT (Dihydrotestosterone). DHT is more potent than testosterone at maintaining normal prostate weight and stroma volume (4). The influence of 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors on prostate is well established but 5-alpha-reductase is also an enzyme associated with androgen metabolism in many organs. Consequently, we introduce hypothesis that 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors may disrupt androgens metabolism in lungs, which in turn may have a negative impact on course of COVID-19 infection.",

The regulative role of androgens in adult human lungs function is an underdeveloped field. Nevertheless, there is limited scientific data indicating that androgens are involved in proper function of respiratory epithelium. Importantly, maintenance and restoration of surfactant layer may be controlled by androgens\u2019 metabolism, where 5-alpha-reductase plays a key role (6). During alveolar fetal development and alveolar repair after inflammatory lung disease close contacts needs to be established between fibroblasts and lung epithelial cells through gaps in the basement membrane (7). It was documented that androgens including DHT disrupt communication between fibroblasts and alveolar type II cells by a mechanism involving TGF\u03b2 (Transforming Growth Factor beta) and EGF (Epidermal Growth Factor) receptor signaling pathways [8], [9].",

It is likely that in mature lung tissue, the androgen regulative pathways analogously to fetal ones are also active. The expression of major regulative enzymes 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase and 5 alpha-reductase was detected in adult lung tissue. Interestingly, it was shown that balanced interplay of both enzymes is physiologically adjusted to obtain precisely regulated androgen inactivation within lungs. Therefore, in contrast to prostate, the physiological function of 5 alpha-reductase in lungs is to locally minimalize androgen potential (11). This action profile is a result of low 5 alpha-reductase affinity to testosterone and high to androstadiene with respiratory epithelium.",

Despite being quiescent tissue, lungs\u2019 regeneration mechanism are activated in pneumonia related injuries (12). Regeneration processes are universal and mimic organogenesis stages, in this situation, restoration of proper respiratory epithelial layer may be dependent on androgens metabolism. Under this assumption, 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors might increase androgen concentration in lungs hampering their regeneration. Interstitial pneumonia is the main cause of life-threatening respiratory disorders at the severe stage of COVID-19 infection (13). Complex lung damage including lung alveolar epithelial cells and fibroblasts is a major hurdle to recovery in those patients. Therefore, inhibition of 5 alpha-reductase might result in impairment of spontaneous regeneration capacity and prolonged or deteriorated recovery prognosis.",
