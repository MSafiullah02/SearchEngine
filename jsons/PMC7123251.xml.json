In countries with temperate climates, such as the United States and Western Europe, late autumn until spring represents the \u201cepidemic season\u201d in which patients are most likely to acquire an RVI [1]. The introduction of reliable and fast polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays in the recent years has allowed for rapid detection of viruses in the NICU, which has in turn challenged the previously held assumption that infants within NICUs are protected from community pathogens [3]. These findings highlight the importance of hand hygiene and other preventive strategies during the epidemic season.",

The importance of palivizumab prophylaxis in this population has been well documented (see chapter \u201cImmunizations in the Nursery\u201d) [10, 11]. Similarly, children with Down syndrome are considered to be high risk for severe RSV infection due to the underlying heart disease that frequently accompanies the condition [1]. Infants with congenital neuromuscular disease are also at high risk from RVI due to reduced vital capacity in the lungs, weak cough and dysphagia inhibiting clearance of respiratory excretions, compromised ability to comply with physiotherapeutic interventions, and recurrent aspiration due to gastroesophageal reflux disease or vomiting due to coughing [12].",

For preterm infants, respiratory deterioration or apnea is common. Nonspecific findings (e.g., feeding intolerance, temperature instability) are also seen. New or evolving radiographic changes are sensitive for lower respiratory tract involvement, but in preterm infants, it is difficult to differentiate viral from bacterial pneumonia in the absence of testing.

For especially devastating infections such as RSV , additional preventative measures include active surveillance with testing, cohorting infected infants away from those testing negative, use of pathogen-specific precautions (see chapter \u201cPrinciples of Infection Prevention in the Nursery\u201d), and limiting patient contact with visitors [27\u201330]. For eligible patients, palivizumab is a safe and effective means of pharmacological prophylaxis against RSV [31]. In 2014, the American Academy of Pediatrics\u2019 Committee on Infectious Diseases and Bronchiolitis Guidelines Committee issued new recommendations for infants eligible to receive palivizumab prophylaxis (see chapter \u201cImmunizations in the Nursery\u201d).",
