Unsaturated fatty acids mainly originate from plants. They are categorized into two major type: monounsaturated fatty acids and polyunsaturated fatty acids. Monounsaturated fatty acids have one double bond in the carbon chain; coenzyme A (CoA) carboxylase is a major enzyme responsible for de novo synthesis of milk fat from acetate conversion inside the mammary gland. Almost 50 % of milk fat is synthesized by this method and modification in this enzyme can lead to alter the milk fat contents. The reduction in the quantity of this enzyme would lead to extreme reduction in the amount of fatty acids in milk. Similarly, it would reduce the requirement of dietary nutrition for the production of fatty acids in milk.

Animal products have trans double bond during rumen biodegradation and formation of intermediates, which is a natural source for generation of trans fatty acids.

In addition, modern biotechnological techniques make this possible to put useful fatty acids in transgenic animals such as polyunsaturated fatty acids. Polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUAFs) contain 18 or more than 18 carbon atoms; and two or more than two double bonds. PUAFs two major groups are omega-6 (n-6) and omega-3 (n-3), on the basis of double bond near the methyl end of fatty acid. Polyunsaturated fatty acids n-3 and n-6 are important constituents of phospholipids in the tissues throughout the body. PUFAs n-3 is especially enriched in the retina and brain (DeFilippis and Sperling 2006; Simopoulos 2006) . Mammals lacking in desaturase require the synthesis of linolenic acid (n-6) and alpha linolenic acid (n-3). Omega-3 fatty acid desaturase is also absent in mammals, as a result, n-3 and n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids are not interconvertible in mammals. Polyunsaturated fatty acid n-3 and n-6 are essential fatty acids for mammals, which must be taken along with diet. The consumption of n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acid increased during the last one and a half century due to the use of vegetable oils of corn, sunflower seeds, cottonseed, and soybeans origin. The vegetable oil from such sources is much enriched with n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids, but n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids are deficient in these sources. Recently, the consumption of n-3 poly unsaturated fatty acids is much lower due to less consumption of fish meat; and consumption of meat and egg produced from commercial feed enriched with n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids, which is deprived of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (Simopoulos 2006) . Previously, many potential useful effects of Omega-3 have been discovered and studied in many populations, large animals, primates, and swine. The major beneficial effects include antiatherosclerotic, reduction in the risk of cardiovascular diseases by reducing the triacylglycerol, cholesterol, and VLDL concentration; reduction in many inflammatory markers such as CRP, IL-6, E-selectin, ICAM-1, VCAM, 1IL-1\u03b2, and TNF-\u03b1; reduction in platelet accumulation and thrombosis, downregulation of PDGF and triggered mononuclear cells; preventing ventricular arrhythmias (Prather et al. 2008) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 669, "end": 699, "text": "(DeFilippis and Sperling 2006;", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 700, "end": 716, "text": "Simopoulos 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF112"}, {"start": 1715, "end": 1732, "text": "(Simopoulos 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF112"}, {"start": 2300, "end": 2321, "text": "(Prather et al. 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF91"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Modification in Fat Contents"}, {"text": "In previous studies, omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids desaturase gene, also called fat 1, has been successfully introduced in mice from a roundworm called Caenorhabditis elegans (reference).

Some later investigations revealed resistance in these transgenic mice to certain diseases such as colitis, chemically induced hepatitis, prostate cancer, and melanoma (Prather et al. 2008) . Human fat 1 gene was introduced into pig with somatic cell nuclear transformation, in a result, threefold increase the level of n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids along with 25 % decrease in n-6 polyunsaturated fatty acids by the efficient conversion of n-6 into n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids Li et al. 2006) . This conversion reduced the n-6/n3 up to five folds in these transgenic pigs compared to control or wild pigs. The reduction of this ration of n-6/n-3 was observed in almost all tissues of transgenic pig in contrast to control animal Li et al. 2006) . Transgenic pigs were developed with plant gene insert (fatty acid desaturation 2 gene) for 12 fatty acid desaturase from spinach. In transgenic animal linoleic acid (18: 2n-6) in adipocytes was ten times more and white adipose tissue contained 20 % more linoleic acid than wild-type pig (Saeki et al. 2004) .

The release of transgenic animal in wild condition could be a good option, but a reliable technique for 100 % sterilization of transgenic fish has not yet been established (Jube and Borthakur 2006) . However, the transgenic technology solicited to develop large size fish with more than 11 times as control. In addition, transgenic fish has no major side effects and health problems. These \"super fish\" are more resistant to disease, more adaptable to cold water, more sustainable in the wild condition compared to nontransgenic fish (Devlin et al. 1994; Du et al. 1992 ). The additional characteristics along with growth rate can also be achieved such as antifreeze protein expression into plasma of transgenic fish. The ocean pout (Macrozoarces americanus) and winter flounder (Pleuronectes americanus) has been previously developed with such proteins and successfully tolerated the freezing temperature of Atlantic Ocean (Davies and Hew 1990) . The antifreezing proteins are characterized into two major types such as antifreeze proteins (AFPs) and antifreeze glycoproteins (AFGs). Antifreezing proteins and antifreezing glycoprotein could lower the freezing temperature of fish serum by attaching to ice surface, to avoid crystal formation. Four type of AFPs (AFP I, AFPII, AFP III, AFP IV) has been discovered, while only one type of AFGs has been identified (Davies and Hew 1990; Jube and Borthakur 2006) . The species of fish with aquaculture importance, such as tilapia and Atlantic salmon, do not survive in the freezing temperature especially in Northern Atlantic coast regions. Therefore, the cage forming of such species are not possible in these regions of subzero temperature. The production and use of transgenic fish, especially salmon with antifreezing protein transgenes would expand the fish farming in the regions of subzero temperature along with reduction farming cost and price for consumers (Jube and Borthakur 2006) . The flounder AFPs belongs to AFPs type I with two isoforms such as skin type and liver type. Skin type AFPs intracellular protein produced into several peripheral tissues in the form of mature protein, while liver AFPs produce in liver in immature form and need further modification before release (Hew et al. 1986; Jube and Borthakur 2006) . Hew et al. (1999) reported transgenic salmons (Salmo salar) to introduce piscine antifreeze protein transgene, which produced liver-specific winter seasonal antifreeze protein. Initially, a single copy of liver type AFPs was injected into fertilized salmon egg, and a stable expression of antifreezing protein was achieved. The consistent expression was observed up to three generation with low concentration of antifreeze protein (250 \u03bcg/ml), which was normally present up to 10-20 mg/ml in winter flounders. This expression was insufficient to harbor the freezing temperature in transgenic salmon. Later, the high concentration was achieved with increase in transgenes copy number. This modification made capable to transgenic salmon in successfully harboring the winter freezing temperature. Similar study was performed on goldfish (Carassius auratus), and transgenic goldfish was successfully harboring the freezing water due to inference of piscine antifreeze protein transgene expression (Wang et al. 1995) . Previously, the transgenic tilapia fish (Oreochromis niloticus) have been established with several salmonids genes constructs, but better results achieved with the Chinook salmon GH gene under the control expression of ocean pout antifreeze promoter (Rahman et al. 1998 ). The insertions of transgenes were achieved with fertilized egg cytoplasmic microinjection technique. The researchers achieved a successful genomic integration of transgene into founder (G 0 ) tilapia, as well as in subsequent generations G1 and G2 of transgenic tilapia. Chinook salmon GH transgene expression into transgenic fish presented three times more growth rate compared to wild tilapia and 33 % more feed conversion ratio (Rahman et al. 1998 ).
