This catchy phrase refers to the following scenario. A subgroup of a population of a certain species gets isolated from the main group (by the eruption of a volcano that burns the ground, leading to the subgroup not crossing this land even if the ground is cooled of, because they do not recognize it as their territory or niche; or by another geographical barrier, such as water because of floods). Given that this isolation takes a very long time, it is possible that one or several random mutations occur and spread within the subgroup. Again, given enough time, should the subgroup and the main group meet again, it could be that these different groups cannot fertilize each other or cannot produce fertile offspring, while members of the same group can produce fertile offspring. If the latter is the case, then we have a new species. Actual examples of allopatric speciation by peripheric isolation have only been reported a couple of times.",

Hence a family tree with a branching pattern is regarded as 1 What is being argued here might seem trivial but it is not. Most non-biologically schooled scholars think that evolutionary biology is simple, it is not. Evolution in some cultures today is part of a way of life, of a philosophical understanding of the world, leading to the idea that everybody knows what evolution is about and that evolution is easily comprehensible. Again, it is not. 2 Recognizing that someone belongs to the same species and that this organism is of the opposite sex and hence a potential mate. the most suitable way of iconizing vertical evolution ( Figure 1 ). 3 This is what Darwin talked about: species are not static entities; they evolve out of each other by speciation. Neo-Darwinian theory, more specifically Ernst Mayr, later on introduced the term allopatric speciation by peripheric isolation. Neo-Darwinian theory also added Mendelian hereditary laws, genes, mutations and mathematics to this speciation concept (Gontier, 2004) to answer the following question: what happens during vertical evolution?",

No species existed before bacteria merged to form larger cells including ancestors to both plants and animals. [. . . ] [L]ong-standing symbiosis led first to the evolution of complex cells with nuclei and from there on to other organisms such as fungi, plants, and animals. (Margulis, 1999: 8) As Margulis (1999; Margulis and Sagan, 2000, 2002) shows, all life can be divided into organisms with two basic cell types: prokaryotic organisms and eukaryotic organisms. Prokaryotes are all (Archae)bacteria (the first kingdom), quantitatively the most common form of life. Typical of these bacteria is the fact that they carry genetic material in their cells and that these genes encode for the proteins present in these cells.

These merged beings evolved into protists and multicellular organisms, ending with the evolution of the fungi, plant and animal kingdoms ( Figure 2 ).

Language is understood as a static, unevolving entity (Croft, 2002: 75-78 ) which leads to the entification and reification of language. This essentialism in turn implicitly subscribes to the idea that there is only one (ideal) language or one (grammatical) language structure understood as a Platonic archetype which takes on different manifestations. So the idea arises that there is only one ideal language, that diversifies into different languages. Essentialist thinking is always about distinguishing the accidental from the essential. De Saussure for example developed his three laws. These state that the primary concern of linguistics is about coming to terms with the following three dichotomous relations within language: (a) the relation between lexicon and grammar; (b) the relation between form and meaning and (c) the relation between langue and parole. These dichotomous relations indeed are instruments to distinguish the accidental from the essential and hence are used to discover the core of 'the' language. This has four major consequences:",

One of his students, Aristotle, internalized these archetypes in human and other beings and elements, saying that the 'ideal form' that the Platonic archetype is, is not part of a transcendental reality, but is potentially part of things. This potential needs to be actualized by a process of becoming. In exactly this way, did Chomsky internalize language, saying that the ideal form is part of the brain and that this potential only needs actualization.

First of all, there is still no evidence of the existence of a universal grammar that statically is part of our brain. This is still only a hypothesis for we can neither pinpoint a module nor some part or neuron in the brain that contains a grammatical or all universal grammatical rules. It is of course useful to develop this idea further and to look into possible evidence for this theory, but it is another thing altogether to speculate upon a speculation or to assume upon an assumption.",

The transition is still far from complete.

Methodologically, when searching for design features, we need to answer the question of what a certain characteristic is for.

His definition, however, only needs a few adjustments (between brackets), to be useful for the purpose of this article: \"Universal symbiogenesis is the [re]attachment of two [or more] structures, after they have been detached from each other and have evolved along separate paths for a long time, so as to form a combined structure with behaviour not seen in the separate components. \" (Dyson, 1998: 121) Symbiogenesis thus falls into place as a form of emergent evolution, known by the catchy phrase 'the whole is more than the sum of its parts'. Within universal symbiogenesis, different elements (neither numbered in advance, nor defined in advance, not implying that these elements need to be replicated faithfully, or have longevity or fecundity) that evolved along separate lines (after they got split off from each other or even when they never showed signs of common descent) somehow are combined and this new combination (a structure, element) has new properties, that cannot be reduced to the parts that form the new structure.",

During colonial times for example thousands of natives were killed because they got the measles from their Western colonizers. Those who survived grew resistant to these infections and now the measles are childhood diseases just as they are in Western countries. These are not the result of genetic adaptations towards the measles.

The Creolization of Pidgin languages mostly happens very quickly, especially when children learn the Pidgin language as their first language ( Bickerton, 2002) ; but when we for instance look at certain dialects or different uses of language as a result of different ages, we too find that they adhere to rapid changes: as a teenager it is popular to use 'slang'. These teenagers also know how to use their language 'properly' and when they work on the weekend or go to school they use this proper form; while going out with their friends they use slang.

The same goes for language: rather than applying an adaptationist, functionalistic approach to language (the what-for question that automatically and teleologically directs itself to the future), one should study the constraints language has and ask how and when-questions that direct the quest to the past, which is more appropriate when studying origins and evolutions.

Hence contextualization and emergentism is what matters (Gontier, 2004) , because the newly developed features are not reducible to the mere elements that make them up. 7 Neo-Darwinian theory, which tries to explain vertical evolution using mathematical algorithms (Dennett, 1995) cannot explain these phenomena using merely these algorithms. An algorithm basically is a linear binary system combined with logic: if gene A is activated (1), then amino acid (a) is formed; if gene A is not activated (0) then amino acid (a) is not formed. Eventually we 7 An observation also made by Adoutte in a somewhat different context: \"The new molecular based phylogeny has several important implications. Foremost among them is the disappearance of \"intermediate\" taxa [. . . ] We have lost the hope, so common in older evolutionary reasoning, of reconstructing the morphology [. . . ] through a scenario involving successive grades of increasing complexity based on the anatomy of extant \"primitive\" lineages. [. . . ] In this respect, the situation is not unlike the new perspective emerging on the phylogeny of eukaryotes as a whole, in which most of the formerly intermediate taxa have been pulled upwards.\" (Adoutte et al., 2000: 4455, my emphasis) get a treelike top-down structure that tries to explain how genes encode for features. However, when we look at the activation or disactivation of different regulatory genes, a network develops, where, if some genes are activated during a certain period at a certain region within the individual, than other genes are switched on or off by proteins that are encoded for by these genes. How many proteins are produced depends upon the activation of certain genes, the locus and the time of development. Regulatory genes are characterized by their pleiotropic effects (Gehring, 1998) and these cannot get formalized using mere algorithms alone. At the very least, non-linear dynamics need to be interwoven with Boolean operators. And even then it is difficult to formalize how genes encode for characteristics, because mostly a 1-1 correspondence between a gene and a trait is lacking. What we find is that genes act more like risk factors. Schr\u00f6dinger (2000) already pointed out years ago, that genes do not encode for characteristics or behaviours. It seems neither adequate nor possible to dissect into discrete 'properties' the pattern of an organism which is essentially a unity, a 'whole'. [...] What we locate in the chromosome is the seat of the difference. (We call it, in technical language, a 'locus', or, if we think of the hypothetical material structure underlying it, a 'gene'.) Difference of property, to my view is really the fundamental concept rather than property itself, notwithstanding the apparent linguistical and logical contradiction of this statement. The differences of properties actually are discrete, [...] . (Schr\u00f6dinger, 2000: 28-29 , my emphasis)",

However, nature gives numerous accounts of organs loosing functions or gaining new functions (Gould and Vrba, 1982) .
