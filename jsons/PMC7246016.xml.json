Forty-two states and the District of Columbia were identified to have issued a stay-at-home order between March 19, 2020 and April 7, 2020. Stay-at-home orders were defined as statewide mandates that included a) mandatory non-essential business closures, b) furloughs enforced for most government and commercial employees, c) prohibition of public events and gatherings, and d) travel restrictions including orders to avoid leaving the home except for necessities such as groceries and medical care.5 Daily confirmed COVID-19 cases were obtained from the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security Application and downloaded via GitHub.",

As expected, R2 fits were substantially better for the logged data and this approach was used throughout the analysis. 95% confidence intervals were obtained for all parameters. Meta-analytic techniques were used to combine data across states using the METAN command suite in Stata. A sensitivity analysis was conducted using the same linear regression and meta-analytic approach to determine whether delaying the days counted as post-order by one week would impact the infection rates and R2 fit statistics.",

In combination with other social isolation approaches and NPIs, these orders may play a significant role in \u201cflattening the curve.\u201d However, this study has a number of important limitations. First, it would be impossible to isolate the effect of these orders against the background of numerous other local, state, and federal interventions occurring at the same time. Second, the expected COVID-19 expansion curve in the absence of interventions to reduce the transmission is unknown. As such, it is possible that the observed slope changes are driven by the natural history of the pandemic as well as the specific policies in question. Two sensitivity analyses were conducted to examine whether the number of days in the pre- and post-periods were drivers of either the slopes or the change in the slopes between periods. In both cases, we found no relationship. Third, states implemented stay-at-home orders in response to the pandemic and these observations are thus profoundly threatened by selection and indication biases. Fourth, even with the use of trend data in this analysis, there is a threat of regression to the mean if stay-at-home orders were consistently placed at the peak of epidemic growth.",

            "text": "Finally, and perhaps most importantly, a major limitation of this work is the endogenous relationship between case counts and both the availability and use of testing. The availability of testing was a significant barrier to COVID-19 diagnoses in the early stages of the pandemic in the U.S. and improved gradually over the month of March. Tests per day increased roughly tenfold between March 15th and March 31st and have increased at a more gradual rate of fourfold over the last six weeks.6 We conducted an additional sensitivity analysis to examine whether the decrease in case incidence between pre- and post-order periods was different if the order occurred before or after April 1st and found the change in slopes to be nearly identical. As mentioned earlier, we also conducted a sensitivity analysis to account for the effect of time on these slopes and found no effect. Overall, the results must be interpreted in the context of this threat. Not only was the availability of tests evolving over this time period, but there is a direct relationship between the number of infections and public awareness of the pandemic and the number of tests performed. As such, it would be difficult to begin to parse out the effect of testing on the rate of incidence of COVID-19. That said, it is likely that the availability of tests may have an unmeasured impact on these results, but we cannot know if the impact was to increase or decrease the incidence rates. Despite these limitations, the consistency and strength of the results is notable. The results presented here will be updated daily and available for public download at www.hpmcovidpolicy.org.",
