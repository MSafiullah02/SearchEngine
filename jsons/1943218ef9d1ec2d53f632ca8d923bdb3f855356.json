The mechanism of their cytotoxic activity has been also examined by immunoassaying the levels of key anti-and proapoptotic protein markers. The analytical and spectral data of the all synthesized target congeners were compatible with their structures. Synthesized compounds showed diverse moderate to powerful antimicrobial and antioxidant activities. Results of MTT assay revealed that seven synthesized compounds (i.e., 11a, 11b, 12a, 12b, 13b, 13c and 13h) particularly exhibited significant cytotoxicity against the three cancerous cell lines under investigation. Ranges of IC 50 values obtained were 5.7-21.3 and 5.8-37.4 \u00b5g/mL against HCT-116 and MCF-7, respectively; which is 3.8 and 6.5-fold (based on the least IC 50 values) more significant relative to the reference chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin. In HepG-2 cells, the analogue 13h exhibited the highest cytotoxicity with IC 50 value of 19.2\u00b5g/mL relative to doxorubicin (IC 50 = 21.6\u00b5g/mL). The observed cytotoxicity was specific to cancerous cells, as evidenced by the minimal toxicity in the noncancerous control skin-fibroblast cells. ELISA results indicated that the observed antiproliferative effect against examined cancer cell lines is mediated via engaging the activation of apoptosis as illustrated by the significant increase in proapoptotic protein markers (p53, bax and caspase-3) and reduction in the antiapoptotic marker bcl-2. Taken together, results of the present study emphasize the potential of spiro pyrazole-oxindole analogues as valuable candidate anticancer agents against human cancer cells.",

The toxicity of the currently available repertoire of anticancer drugs and the inefficiency of chemotherapies are two major limitations in the battle against cancer. Therefore, designing and discovering effective and selective antitumor agents remains the primary objective in organic medical chemistry known as targeted therapeutic strategies [3] . One of these strategies is apoptosis a.k.a. programmed cell death that is considered an essential mechanism by the body to eliminate unwanted cells [4, 5] . Therefore, triggering apoptosis in cancer cells will lead to immediate death and thereby increasing the control of cancer proliferation [4, 5] . Methodically understanding the mechanism of apoptosis discloses that it is influenced by the expression of caspases, Bcl-2 family proteins, including either antiapoptotic or proapoptotic members [6, 7] . Induction of apoptosis is considered as one of the most successful strategies to target cancer [4] [5] [6] [7] .",

            "text": "Isatin and its derivatives are a promising class of heterocyclic molecules that have diverse biological activities of interest [8] . The most common application of isatins in organic synthesis is primarily focused on the highly reactive C-3 carbonyl group [9] . The vast majority of reactions of the C-3 carbonyl group of isatins are nucleophilic additions or spiroannulation, which transform it into 2-oxindole derivatives [9] . To this end, 2-Oxindoles, particularly those that are spiro-fused to other cyclic frames, have attracted significant research interest in the disciplines of synthetic organic chemistry and medicinal chemistry [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . They represent the core structures in a variety of natural products and drugs, such as isomitraphylline, isocorynoxine, isorhnchophlline, mitraphylline and uncarine [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . Interestingly spirocyclic oxindoles or spiro-oxindoles combined to a rigid heterocyclic ring at C-3 of the oxindole core are the most efficacious class of small molecules. They inhibit cell proliferation, induce apoptosis in cancer cells and lead to tumor growth regression without affecting normal cells [15] [16] [17] . For example, it has been documented that oxindole alkaloids derived from the root bark of Uncaria tomentosa plants exhibit apoptosis-mediated cytotoxicity against acute lymphoblastic leukaemia cells [18] .",

Meanwhile, treatment of the HCT-116 cells with compounds 11a, 11b, 12a and 12b conspicuously reduced the expression levels of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 b\u1ef9 66%, 76%, 26%, and 29%, respectively, compared to the control (Table 6 ).

            "text": "Cell apoptosis is a sophisticated meticulously regulated biological process that is associated with complex signaling pathway responses [7, 25] . Caspases are a group of cysteine-aspartic acid proteases that play a pivotal role as in the execution and intracellular regulation of apoptosis [26] . Caspase-3 is a key executioner of apoptosis that is activated both extrinsically (death ligands) and intrinsically (mitochondrial dysfunction) [27, 28] . On the other hand, the tumor suppressor protein p53 is a positive regulator of the Bcl-2-associated X (Bax), Bcl-2-associated death promoter (Bad) and Bcl-2 homologous antagonist/killer (Bak) proapoptotic proteins to prevent Bcl-2 capture [7, 29] . Free Bax, Bad and Bak subsequently bind to the mitochondrial membrane to induce mitochondrial damage and cell apoptosis [30] . Zhang and his coworker have demonstrated that p53 promotes the transcription of Bax and Bak, which regulate the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria and result in cell apoptosis by activating the cleaving of caspase-3 [7] . Therefore, the increase in the expression of P53 and Bax causes the increase of the protein expression levels of active caspase-3. In the present study, treatment of the MCF-7 cell with compounds 11a, 11b, 12a, 12b and 13c resulted in a significant elevation of active caspase-3 protein levels by~1.6, 1.6, 1.4, 4.6 and 3.8 folds, respectively, compared to the control. In line with the previous, compounds 11a, 11b, 12a, 12b and 13c increased the expression levels of proapoptotic p53 and Bax compared to the control. In addition, treatment of the HCT-116 cell with compounds 11a, 11b, 12a, 12b and 13c gave rise of caspase-3 protein levels by~1.5, 1.0, 1.3 and 2.4 folds, respectively, compared to the control, as well as increase the expressions of proapoptotic proteins p53 and Bax compared to the control. Despite that the compound 13c increased the expression of active caspase-3, p53 and Bax proteins, it caused an increase of the Bcl-2 protein level. This result suggests that, additional yet undefined regulatory mechanism might be present to fine-tune apoptosis induction by 13c treatment (Table 5) , which merits further investigation.",
