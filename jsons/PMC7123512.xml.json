Various methods may be employed: spontaneous surveillance, prescription-event monitoring (PEM), linkage analysis, case-control surveillance and cohort studies [5]. In 1963, the 16th World Health Assembly reaffirmed the need for early detection and rapid dissemination of information on adverse reactions due to medications. This affirmation led to the creation of the World Health Organization (WHO) Programme for International Drug Monitoring, under whose auspices systems have been created in member states for the collection and evaluation of individual case safety reports (ICSRs) [12]. In 1978 the WHO set up its international drug monitoring programme in Sweden at the Uppsala Monitoring Centre (UMC) http://www.who-umc.org. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) provides several options for reporting adverse events. One such option is MedWatch, the FDA Safety Information and Adverse Event Reporting Program http://www.fda.gov/safety/MedWatch/default.htm\n, founded in 1993 as a system for both consumers and healthcare professionals to report adverse events. MedWatch is intended to detect safety hazard signals for medical products; in the event a signal is detected, the FDA can issue medical product safety alerts or order product recalls, withdrawals, or labelling changes to protect the public health [13].",

Histologically, drug eruptions can elicit a variety of inflammatory disease patterns in the skin and panniculus, and overlapping reaction patterns. Ackerman et al.\u2019s basic patterns of inflammatory skin diseases [84] (Table 25.3) are a helpful guide. The most common pattern of drug eruptions is the perivascular type, while psoriasiform and granulomatous patterns are rarely reported [85]. Drug eruptions may also mimic specific skin diseases such as lupus, lichen planus or lymphoma [85]. A single drug may cause a wide range of reaction patterns and no reaction pattern is specific for a particular drug [88]. While the histological changes are not distinctive in many cases of drug eruption, a few important histopathological clues may aid in the diagnosis: (1) Overlapping histological patterns in one specimen (e.g., lichenoid and spongiotic). (2) Presence of eosinophils (although not mandatory); although eosinophils are an important tell-tale sign of a drug-induced reaction, they may also be conspicuous in skin rashes devoid of a drug association and sparse or absent in some drug exanthems. (3) Apoptotic keratinocytes. (4) Mismatch between clinical and histomorphological features [85, 86, 88].\n",

Drugs are the second most common cause of anaphylaxis after food, which constitutes 20 % of triggers [98]. Common medications associated with anaphylaxis include penicillins, NSAIDs, and biologic response modifiers [99]. The NIAID/FAAN definition of anaphylaxis has been translated into clinical diagnostic criteria that include an acute onset of illness (minutes to hours) and involvement of the dermatologic, respiratory, cardiovascular, or gastrointestinal systems [98]. Epinephrine is the only first-line treatment for anaphylaxis and is the sole effective treatment for an acute reaction. Delays in administration have been associated with fatalities. Supportive treatment with oxygen, fluids and additional drugs are also necessary according to the cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) anaphylaxis algorithm [98].\nSerum sickness-like reaction (SSLR) \u2013 See Severe Cutaneous Adverse Drug Reactions.\n",

In fact, continuation of EGFRI therapy in these patients may be especially favourable in view of studies that have shown an increased survival with increasing severity of rash [102]. The cutaneous reaction serves as an important clinical tool for determining tumor response and survival [102]. The National Cancer Institute developed a scale for defining the degree of rash and laid down management guidelines for each stage [103]. Other management protocols were suggested by Bachet et al. [107], who recommended that unless contraindicated, a tetracycline should be routinely prescribed for the prevention of acneiform eruption in patients treated with an EGFRI for more than 6 weeks. Chiang et al. [106] reported successful treatment with isotretinoin for high grade and refractory cases.",

Generalized bullous FDE may resemble SJS/TEN. The following typical clinical features of generalized bullous FDE may aid in differentiating between conditions: (1) Blistering usually affects only a small percentage of body surface area, and between the large blisters there are sizable areas of intact skin. (2) Erosive mucosal involvement is rare, and when it does occur is rather mild. (3) Patients usually do not feel sick or have fever, and generally are in much better overall health than those with SJS/TEN.

The extent of skin involvement varies between studies: it exceeded 50 % of the body surface area in most of the patients (79 %) according to the RegiSCAR study [142]; head and neck edema observed in most patients [26, 142]; and pustules reported in various studies, predominantly in a facial distribution of the edema [142, 143].",

Lymphadenopathy is common and has two distinct types: a benign pattern of lymphoid hyperplasia and a pseudolymphoma pattern [150]. Hematologic abnormalities are frequent and diverse, the most common being marked leukocytosis, eosinophilia and atypical lymphocytes [142]. However, neutrophilia, monocytosis, thrombocytopenia, anemia, pancytopenia and hemophagocytic syndrome were also reported [140, 142, 143, 151]. Hypereosinophilia and activated neutrophils, if persistent, can contribute to organ damage [142]. The liver is the most frequently affected visceral organ in DRESS; hepatitis with isolated elevation of liver enzymes is common and usually anicteric and without cholangitis. However, severe acute hepatitis with liver failure may result and is the primary cause of mortality in DRESS [150]. Renal involvement is common [150]. Involvement of the following organs was also reported: lungs, muscle, heart, pancreas, colon, thyroid, joints, parotid gland and brain [150]. The type of organs involved was found to be related to the eliciting drug [152].",

(2) Severe systemic involvement (transaminases >5 times normal, renal involvement, pneumonia, hemophagocytosis, cardiac, etc.): systemic corticosteroids equivalent to 1 mg/kg/day of prednisone and multidisciplinary evaluation. (3) Life-threatening signs (hemophagocytosis with bone marrow failure, encephalitis, severe hepatitis, renal failure, and respiratory failure): systemic steroids with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) at a dose of 2 g/kg over 5 days. The IVIG should not be used without associated steroids. The treatments are to be conducted under multidisciplinary supervision.

Late complications include the appearance of autoimmune diseases such as lupus erythematosus and autoimmune thyroiditis, with laboratory evidence of autoantibodies [144]. Systemic corticosteroids were found beneficial in the prevention of autoimmune disease. However, this effect needs to be counterbalanced against the higher risk of viral reactivation and infection. [144]. In a 1-year follow-up study of 52 affected patients with DRESS in Taiwan, the overall cumulative incidence of long-term sequelae was 11.5 %; four developed autoimmune diseases (Graves disease, type 1 diabetes mellitus and autoimmune hemolytic anemia); and the other two developed renal failure and required lifelong hemodialysis. The author concluded that the sequelae of DRESS can be divided into two major types that appear in different age groups: young patients tend to develop autoimmune diseases; elderly patients are more vulnerable to end-organ failure [158].",

A paucicellular, dermal mononuclear infiltrate has been commonly described. Lymphocytes cross the dermoepidermal junction with moderate infiltration of the epidermis. EM and SJS often demonstrate less keratinocyte destruction on a background of extensive dermal mononuclear inflammation [202]. In a retrospective analysis of the clinical records and histologic material of 37 patients with TEN, the histologic spectrum ranged from sparse to extensive dermal mononuclear inflammation, the extent of which predicts clinical outcome approximately as well as SCORTEN. Increased inflammation correlated with a worse prognosis; a mean cell count of dermal mononuclear >215 cells per high-power field predicted a worse prognosis (65 %) vs 24 % mortality in those with <215 cells in patients with 30 % or more total body surface area sloughing [202]. However, in a retrospective study analyzing clinical records and skin biopsy of 108 patients with SJS, SJS/TEN overlap and TEN, dermal infiltrate severity was not associated with day-1 SCORTEN or hospital death, but full-thickness epidermal necrosis was associated with mortality [203].",

            "text": "The management of SJS/TEN consists of a multidisciplinary approach that includes the following important aspects:\nIdentification and withdrawal of the culprit drug: documenting the medication history during the previous 2 months and withdrawal of all suspected and unessential medications [123].\nTransfer of the patient to intensive care, burn unit or other specialty unit: supportive care including thermoregulation, fluid replacement, nutritional support, monitoring for infection, sedation and pain management, and psychological support [204].\nAssessment of skin, mucous membranes and systemic involvement and the SCORTEN score: Type of lesions in the skin, extent of epidermal detachment, and mucous membranes and systemic involvement. All patients should be evaluated by an ophthalmologist promptly following the diagnosis and at regular follow-up intervals to minimize potential long-term ocular sequelae [205]. Possible acute manifestations include the eyelids, conjunctiva and cornea, and result in the classification of ocular involvement as mild, moderate or severe [206]. Bringing other specialists in on the patient\u2019s care is decided in accordance with the relevant findings. The SCORTEN system, a severity-of-illness score for Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis, developed to stratify severity of illness and predict mortality in patients with TEN, includes seven independent risk factors: age, malignancy, tachycardia, initial body surface area of epidermal detachment, serum urea, serum glucose, and bicarbonate [207].\nSkin treatment: There are no clinical guidelines for the skin care of patients with SJS/TEN. Debridement of the necrotic epidermis was recommended in past publications [187, 204]. Recent publications advise avoiding debridement, which may cause hypertrophic scars, and recommend considering the detached epidermis as a natural biological dressing that favors reepithelialization [14, 205, 208]. Various topical treatments reported include bioactive skin substitutes, semi-synthetic and synthetic dressings, and topical antimicrobials [187, 204]. A recent report on the management of SJS/TEN in an experienced French referral center described the following treatment; wound care once a day with minimal manipulation to prevent skin detachment, including a bath containing a solution of chlorhexidine 1/5000 (morphine is given prior to the bath and/or equimolar mix of oxygen and nitrogen monoxide during the bath); if bathing is not possible, the chlorhexidine solution is sprayed 2\u20133 times daily on the skin, blister fluid is aspirated while maintaining the blister roof, vaseline is systemically applied over all detached skin areas, topical sulfa-containing medications are avoided, and hydrocellular or absorbent nonadhesive dressings are applied at least once daily to cover pressure points [205].\nMucous membranes treatment: Specialized care is essential to prevent lifelong complications [208]. Although there is no standardized care for ocular management, the following supportive local treatment is advised: tear replacement solutions, removal of pseudo-membranes, lysis of symblepharon, debridement of loosened epithelium, topical antibiotics to prevent secondary infection, topical corticosteroid to prevent scar formation, and cycloplegic drops to relieve pain, photophobia and ciliary spasm [206]. Amniotic membrane transplantation was found effective in the acute and chronic stages of SJS/TEN [209, 210]. A \u2018Triple-TEN\u2019 protocol for severe ocular cases was recently reported [211], comprised of the following: (1) Subconjunctival triamcinolone (Kenalog 20 mg) administered into each of the fornices to curb the local inflammatory response without compromising systemic immunity. (2) Placement of amniotic membrane tissue mounted on a polycarbonate skirt (ProKera) over the corneal and limbal regions to facilitate reepithelialization of the ocular surface. (3) insertion of a steeply curved acrylic scleral shell spacer (Technovent, SC21) to vault the lids away from the globe and provide a barrier to symblephara formation. This treatment offers an effective therapeutic option, without the need for microsurgical equipment, microscope, or sutures in the critical care setting.Oral- The mouth should be rinsed several times a day with an antiseptic or anifungal solution and the lips lubricated with an ointment such as dexpanthenol [123].Genital- Wet dressings or sitz baths and lubrication with emollient are recommended to avoid adhesions and strictures of genital erosions in females [123, 205].A specialist is required in case of involvement of other mucous membranes: respiratory, gastrointestinal and/or urethral.\nSystemic immunomodulatory treatment: The optimal therapeutic regimen has yet to be established, but according to recent publications, the following conclusions can be drawn: the use of IVIg does not yield survival benefits in SJS/TEN [212]; cyclosporine decreased the death rate and the progression of detachment (dosage of 3 mg/kg/day for 10 days) [213]; systemic corticosteroids were associated with clinical benefit according to the Euroscar-study [214] and were reported to be the most common treatment for SJS/TEN in a recent survey of 50 drug hypersensitivity experts from 20 countries [14]. One of the suggested protocols is IV dexamethasone 1.5 mg/kg pulse therapy (given for 30\u201360 min) for 3 consecutive days [215]. Treatment with anti-TNF biologic treatment was reported to be beneficial [216\u2013218]. A prospective, randomized, open-label trial currently underway in Taiwan [14] comparing etanercept versus systemic corticosteroids in patients with SJS/TEN, reported that the average duration to reach maximal skin detachment and complete skin healing was shorter in the etanercept group. In vitro investigations demonstrated that etanercept, steroids or thalidomide significantly decreased granulysin expression of blister cells. Etanercept did not, however, increase the cytotoxic effect to keratinocytes found with thalidomide [14].\nCausality assessment and communication with the patient and his/her family, health-care providers and regulatory agencies: Recent discoveries of specific HLAs that predict genetic susceptibility to SJS/TEN offer a simple, fast, safe and reliable method for establishing clear causality between a drug and a disease [148]. The HLAs are specific to a drug and an ethnic background [148]. Since these tests are available only for certain drugs and a negative test does not exclude the drug as the offending agent, additional clinical and laboratory methods are available for assessing causality. (See Practical approach to the diagnosis and management of cutaneous ADRS and Clinical and laboratory assays in the diagnosis of cutaneous ADRs.) For information on communication with the patient and his/her family, health-care providers and regulatory agencies see Practical approach to the diagnosis and management of cutaneous ADRS.\n",

In a large-scale, population-based, 1-year follow-up study of 460 SJS/TEN patients, the 6-week in-hospital mortality rate was 23 %, and the death rate from 6 weeks to 1 year was 14 % [219]. The mortality rate at 1 year in this study was 24 % for SJS, 43 % for SJS and TEN overlap, and 49 % for TEN. Several factors were found to affect mortality: age, severity of reaction, recent malignancy, pre-existing severe kidney or liver disorder, and recent infection. The last two factors were recognized for the first time in this study as being independent risk factors for death. All other factors are part of the SCORTEN [207]. The severity of the reaction was a major risk factor for death in the first few weeks, and severe co-morbidities and older age had major impact on mortality after 6 weeks [219]. Early and late physical complications are common among patients who survive SJS/TEN [219], with some 80 % experiencing long-term sequelae [220]. Complications may affect multiple organ systems including skin, nails, hair, oral and genital mucosal sufaces, eyes, kidneys, gastrointestinal tract, and respiratory system [221]. Ocular complications, which can lead to blindness, are the major long-term morbidity [206]. A few studies have dealt with the quality of life of patients surviving SJS/TEN [221\u2013223], which was found to be lower in every domain from before hospitalization to follow-up and a low rate of return to previous employment was documented [221]. Patients reported concerns about social interactions, fear of taking medications, and fear of contracting an illness necessitating medication [223]. Insufficient information and support for patients surviving SJS/TEN was also documented [221\u2013223]. Unfortunately, because of the rarity of SJS/TEN, most physicians are not aware of the long-term complications of the diseases [220].",

This genetic association is strong enough that it prompted the USFDA and many countries to relabel the genetic information for carbamazepine, and to recommend screening for HLA-B*1502 before prescribing the drug for subjects of Asian descent. The HLA-B*1502 test for carbamazepine-induced SJS/TEN has very high sensitivity (near 100 %) and specificity (97 %). With the 0.25 % prevalence rate of carbamazepine-induced SJS/TEN among Chinese, the HLA-B*1502 test has a 7.7 % positive predictive value and 100 % negative predictive value for detecting [226]. In view of the serious consequences of SJS/TEN and the availability of alternative drugs, withholding carbamazepine from screened patients who test positive for HLA-B*1502 and switching to alternative antiepileptic drugs is reasonable and feasible in the high risk populations, including Chinese and South-East Asians.",

LTT is based on the activation and proliferation of T cells from PBMC obtained from drug-sensitized patients after stimulation, and incubation with the culprit drug in vitro [230]. Following in vitro stimulation by specific drugs, drug-specific T cells are activated and release several cytokines that promote proliferation of T cells. This in vitro proliferation of specific drug-activated T cells can be detected by the incorporation of 3H-thymidine during DNA synthesis after 6 days of culture. The results of LTT are expressed as the stimulation index (SI): the relationship between the 3H-thymidine uptake in cells (counts per minute (c.p.m.)) with and without the drug antigen [229]. The general sensitivity of the LTT is 50\u201380 %, varying with different drugs and different phenotypes of delayed-type hypersensitivity reactions; thus, a negative result does not exclude the possibility of drug hypersensitivity. Extensive studies on LTT for beta-lactam drugs report even higher sensitivity [230\u2013234]. The specificity of the LTT is 85\u2013100 % in different studies [231\u2013233, 235].",

In this decade, our understanding of the pathogenesis of cutaneous ADRs had progressed greatly. Understanding how a drug can possibly cause reactions in the skin has led to an understanding of the cellular immunology, cytokines and immunogenetics. These key insights can help mitigate the risk of reactions by testing for genetic factors, and to understand the treatment of drug reactions by better understanding the pathways involved. The future will depend on better genetic screening and directed approved therapies.",
