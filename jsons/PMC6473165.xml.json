They belong to the family Papillomaviridae, which currently contains more than 130 recognized species in more than 50 genera. Most PVs are contained within the subfamily Firstpapillomavirinae and are associated with amniote hosts (reptiles, birds, and mammals), while the subfamily Secondpapillomavirinae contains a single viral species that has been identified in a fish (Van Doorslaer et al., 2018). Their genomes contain several open-reading frames (ORFs), all located on the same DNA strand, encoding the structural or late proteins (L1 and L2) and several nonstructural or early proteins (E1\u2013E9), and a non-coding regulatory region known as the long control region (LCR). Some viruses also possess a second non-coding region. Although the genomic structure is similar across different species, the number of encoded E proteins is variable and only the core ORFs E1, E2, L2, and L1 are present in all PV genomes characterized to date (Rector and Van Ranst, 2013).",

            "text": "Most of the currently known PVs infect humans, but with modern improved sequencing technologies and virus discovery methods the number of known animal PVs is rapidly increasing, revealing a possibly comparable genotype diversity in other animals (Rector and Van Ranst, 2013; Bravo and F\u00e9lez-S\u00e1nchez, 2015). Originally, PVs were considered to be strictly host species-specific, with only rare cases of cross-species transmission, indicative of a long virus\u2013host association and a subsequent tendency of viruses to codiverge with their hosts (Shah et al., 2010). However, this paradigm is vacillating (Gottschling et al., 2007). In fact, although virus\u2013host coevolution and intra-host duplication are still considered the principal driving forces for PV evolution, other evolutionary forces, such as host-switching, seem to be involved, and a broad host range may be more common than anticipated (Shah et al., 2010; Bravo and F\u00e9lez-S\u00e1nchez, 2015). For example, several distantly related PVs have been observed in bats (Garc\u00eda-P\u00e9rez et al., 2014) and some viruses are able to cross species borders, such as some bovine PV types that can also infect various other herbivores, equids, and cats (Chambers et al., 2003; Costa et al., 2017), with species-specificity being less strict among genetically closely related hosts (Gottschling et al., 2007; Chen et al., 2009).",

In fact, to our knowledge, only eight APV species have been described so far in seven bird species in six orders, and clinical data are only available for some of these. The first evidence of viral involvement in skin lesions on bird legs goes back to the early 1970s, when Lina et al. (1973) reported evidence from electron microscopy for the presence of PVs in squamous papilloma tissues collected from chaffinches (Fringilla coelebs). Since then, the presence of this virus in cutaneous lesions of chaffinches has been confirmed several times in different European countries (Liter\u00e1k et al., 2012; Truchado et al., 2018b).",

Furthermore, a PV was recently identified in cutaneous lesions of a griffon vulture (Gyps fulvus) (Di Francesco et al., 2019) and the Francolinus leucoscepus PV (FlPV-1) was identified on the healthy skin of a yellow-necked francolin (Van Doorslaer et al., 2009). There is also evidence for the existence of mucocutaneous APVs in birds: the Serinus canaria PV (ScPV-1) was detected in the oral cavity of canaries (Truchado et al., 2018a) and three other APV species were identified in cloacal swabs or fecal content of the Ad\u00e9lie penguin [Pygoscelis adeliae PV-1 (PaPV-1) and -2] and in mallard [Anas platyrhynchos; duck PV (DuPV)] (Varsani et al., 2014; Fawaz et al., 2016; Van Doorslaer et al., 2017b; Williams et al., 2018). Two independent studies that analyzed samples from India and Sweden reported identification of the same PV (DuPV-1) in mallard, with a second variant, DuPV-2, observed in the Swedish study only (Fawaz et al., 2016; Williams et al., 2018).",

In detail, nucleic acids (NAs) were isolated from 200 \u03bcl of thoroughly vortexed transport medium sample with the DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit (Qiagen) and 2.5 \u03bcl isolated NAs was used as input in a 25 \u03bcl reaction mix containing 0.2 \u03bcM specific primer, 0.8 \u03bcM random primer, and 1\u00d7 DreamTaq Green PCR Master Mix (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

E6 proteins of APVs are 81\u201399 amino acids long, somewhat shorter compared to the E6 proteins of other PVs (approximately 150 amino acids long), and contain one unique predicted zinc-binding domain instead of two. This domain, formed by two pairs of CXXC motifs separated by 39\u201342 amino acids, was highly conserved across viruses, with the exception of FgPV-1 (Figure 2A). The N-terminal portion of the E7 protein of APVs is extended when compared to mammalian PVs (Van Doorslaer et al., 2009, 2017a). However, the typical retinoblastoma tumor suppressor (pRb)-binding domain (LXCXE) was present in the E7 of all APVs, although its location was variable among the different viruses, and the typical zinc-binding domain was present at the C-terminal side of all APV E7 proteins (Figure 2B).",

Furthermore, it is possible that all DuPVs could be classified within the genus Dyoepsilonpapillomavirus (identity between DuPV-1, -2, and -3 and FlPV-1: 62.4\u201365.9%), although the existence of this clade was only supported when the whole L1 sequence was used for phylogenetic reconstruction (Figure 4B and Supplementary Figure S1).",

This prediction is based on other APVs where the L1 start codon overlaps the stop codon of the L2 ORF and is immediately downstream of a highly supported splicing acceptor site. Furthermore, the predicted L1 protein, when translated as starting from this GTG codon, is homologous to other APV L1 proteins. Although yet to be experimentally substantiated, these genetic features lead us to hypothesize that this GTG may be used as an alternative start codon in the puffin viruses, as also previously hypothesized for an avian circovirus (Todd et al., 2007). GTG is frequently used by bacteria as a start codon (Villegas and Kropinski, 2008) and there is evidence for the use of GTG as an alternative start codon in mitochondria (Bock et al., 1994; Perseke et al., 2011). Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that GTG can be used as an alternative start codon in Drosophila melanogaster (Sugihara et al., 1990) and there is in vitro experimental evidence for its use to start protein translation in mammalian cell lines (Fuxe et al., 2000; Hwang et al., 2005). Use of this alternative start codon has been shown to lead to lower protein production in comparison to ATG (Sugihara et al., 1990; Hwang et al., 2005), so using this codon may be a way for the virus to regulate the expression of the L1 protein. However, pending experimental validation, this remains speculation and it is also possible that the virus uses an ATG start codon that is located at an atypical position for L1 translation initiation.",

All of these species are considered part of a mallard-type complex and whether they even represent good species has been questioned (Mank et al., 2004). Any genetic barriers are, therefore, probably small and easy for viruses to bypass. Furthermore, there are no ecological barriers for virus transmission because they often live in close proximity in crowded environments and interbreed. These aspects of duck ecology favor viral transmission and, in turn, may influence viral ecology and evolution. Investigating PVs infecting other Anas spp. that are not part of the mallard-type complex (e.g., wigeons or teals) will be instructive in determining the importance of host species for cross-infectivity.",

The higher infection rate found in adults and during the pre-breeding season could support a sexual route of transmission; however, viruses were also detected in juvenile birds and we showed the virus could be present in the oropharyngeal compartment and not in the cloaca. Finally, the occurrence of persistent infection was demonstrated for DuPV-1 and DuPV-2, but we could not prove whether this is the case for DuPV-3 as sequential samples were only available for one individual that did not show evidence of persistent infection. Although many pieces of the puzzle are still missing for all three duck viruses, and future studies may reveal more common traits, it is possible that DuPV-1 and -2 possess a different tropism than DuPV-3 and this would explain differences in viral ecology and distribution.",

Only one viral type was identified in puffins, while a very high viral genetic diversity was observed within the Laridae, where 10 distinct viral types were identified among 30 individual birds, with the highest viral diversity observed in black-legged kittiwake (7 types among 13 infected individuals). Differently from what was observed for the duck viruses, we identified non-synonymous substitutions, indicating a weaker negative selection pressure on the L1 capsid protein, and suggestive of a more recent virus\u2013host association. Unfortunately, only partial L1 sequences could be obtained for some of the types and obtaining the complete genomic sequences of more viral types is therefore a priority.",

Both species were sampled at the same time and place and it is possible that habitat sharing is facilitating cross-species transmissions. However, the large white-headed gulls (which include these two species) are a closely related genetic complex with evidence of recent introgression (Sonsthagen et al., 2016), possibly reducing barriers to cross-species transmission. Viral estimated prevalence was high in American herring gull (17%) and only one positive great black-backed gull was identified, pointing toward American herring gull being the main host for these viruses, although a smaller number of samples from great black-backed gull was tested. No cross-species transmission was identified for the other viruses.",

            "text": "A remarkably high estimated viral prevalence was observed in black-legged kittiwake (>80%) and this pattern could be explained by host-related factors. Kittiwakes nest on cliff ledges in colonies with individuals in close proximity (Hatch et al., 2009), behavior that could facilitate viral spread. On the contrary, puffins excavate nesting burrows into the soil, causing birds to be somewhat more segregated (Harris and Wanless, 2011), possibly explaining their lower estimated viral prevalence (approximately 10%). It should be noted, however, that puffins are very social, participating in various behavioral displays and regularly interacting outside their burrows (Harris and Wanless, 2011). An alternative explanation is that the primers used to screen samples collected from the Alcidae were more species-specific than those used to screen samples from the Laridae, resulting in an artificially lower estimate of prevalence. Finally, the chance that viral infection rates are related to sexual promiscuity is low as extra-pair copulations are rare in kittiwakes (Helfenstein et al., 2004), gulls (Gilbert et al., 1998), and puffins (Creelman and Storey, 1991).",

Kittiwakes similarly over-winter on the Grand Banks, with birds that breed in North America mixing with those from colonies in Europe (Bogdanova et al., 2011; Frederiksen et al., 2011), possibly explaining the co-occurrence of several different types.

In our study APVs showed a monophyletic origin. However, the phylogenetic placement of FgPV-1 within the avian clade was not consistent across analyses and other studies already reported its position cannot be determined with certainty (Van Doorslaer et al., 2017b). We observed that different viral types (and species) infecting birds classified within the same order tend to cluster together, mirroring the phylogeny of their avian hosts. This was evident for all four viral genera containing more than one viral species where the two different species within the genus Etapapillomavirus infect two members of the order Passeriformes, the two viral species within the genus Treisepsilonpapillomavirus both infect Ad\u00e9lie penguin, all three duck viruses were grouped within the same genus, and all viruses found in birds within the Charadriiformes (both families Laridae and Alcidae) could be grouped within the same genus. Furthermore, with some exceptions, different viruses infecting one host species tend to have a monophyletic origin. We could also observe that the closer relationship between the two bird orders Anseriformes and Galliformes was reflected by the presence of a viral clade (possibly corresponding to the genus Dyoepsilonpapillomavirus) containing all viruses identified to-date in birds belonging to these taxa (the duck viruses and FlPV-1). Finally, the same was observed for viruses of the Charadriiformes and Sphenisciformes, whose close phylogenetic relationships match that of their hosts. In this scenario, the relationship of the virus identified in the Northern Fulmar (FgPV-1) to other APVs is puzzling. Its unusual genomic organization, as well as its uncertain phylogenetic placement, may suggest the existence of two different major APV clades.",

In particular, viruses infecting birds within the Charadriiformes formed several independent and highly supported clades that did not coincide with the host species in which they were found. Specifically, we identified two highly supported clades including viruses found in birds from the genera Larus and Rissa and found that some gull viruses are more closely related to kittiwake viruses than to each other. These intricate connections demonstrate that a possibly extensive exchange of viruses has occurred among Laridae in the past, which allowed several viral lineages to diverge in related bird species. Furthermore, the gull viral-type GuPV-2 and the duck viral-type DuPV-3 were identified in two different host species (albeit closely related species that are able to hybridize), indicating that cross-species transmission still occurs and that host-specificity constraints are relaxed among more closely related hosts, as already reported for other non-avian PVs (Gottschling et al., 2007; Chen et al., 2009). However, the two GuPV-2 strains identified in American herring gull and great black-backed gull were only approximately 98% identical, possibly indicating a recent strain segregation. In this context, host ecology and behavior may be important factors in determining viral ecology, distribution, transmission patterns, and, eventually, evolution.",

The tree was built with the maximum-likelihood method (Felsenstein, 1981) based on the Kimura 2 parameters model (Kimura, 1980), identified as the best-fitting model after the model test analysis in MEGA 7 (Kumar et al., 2016). A discrete Gamma distribution was used to model evolutionary rate differences among sites (+G = 0.9136) and branch lengths are proportional to genetic distances as indicated by the scale bar. The outcome of the bootstrap analysis (Felsenstein, 1985) is shown next to the nodes, while the corresponding bootstrap values obtained in a different analysis involving the whole L1 open-reading frame (Supplementary Figure S1) is shown in parenthesis. Viruses are marked by type name and the strain name is also indicated for viruses described in this study (indicated by a star), while established viral genera are shown on the right. Viruses are labeled by a colored dot that indicates the order of the birds in which they were identified, as indicated in the legend, and hosts are indicated within viral type names (Du, duck; Fc, Fringilla coelebs; Fg, Fulmarus glacialis; Fl, Francolinus leucoscepus; Gf, Gyps fulvus; Gu, gull; Ki, kittiwake; Pa, Pygoscelis adeliae; Pe, Psittacus erithacus timneh; Pu, puffin; Sc, Serinus canaria; CC, Caretta caretta; Cm, Chelonia mydas, Ec, Equus ferus caballus, Ra, Rousettus aegyptiacus).

The tree is based on L1 sequences of all PVs identified in this study from Atlantic puffin (ATPU, blue), American herring gull (HERG, yellow), great black-backed gull (GBBG, orange), and black-legged kittiwake (BLKI, pink). The four proposed different species are indicated by green dots at the base of the species branch. The tree was built with the maximum-likelihood method (Felsenstein, 1981) based on the Tamura\u2013Nei model (Tamura and Nei, 1993), identified as the best-fitting model after the model test analysis in MEGA 7 (Kumar et al., 2016). A discrete Gamma distribution was used to model evolutionary rate differences among sites (+G = 0.9236) and the rate variation model allowed for some sites to be evolutionarily invariable ([+I], 23.03% of sites). Branch lengths are proportional to genetic distances as indicated by the scale bar and the outcome of the bootstrap analysis (Felsenstein, 1985) is shown next to the nodes. Viral types or putative types are indicated on the right, and PaPV-1 was used as an outgroup.",
