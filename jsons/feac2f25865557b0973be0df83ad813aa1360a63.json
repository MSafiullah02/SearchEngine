These immune modulating factors can include endotoxin from gram negative bacterial outer membrane component, commonly referred to as lipopolysaccharide (LPS). In this study, our objective was to examine the relationship between intestinal barrier integrity, endotoxin and infl ammation with feed effi ciency (FE), using pig lines divergently selected for residual feed intake (RFI) as a model. Twelve gilts (62 \u00b1 3 kg BW) from the low RFI (LRFI, more effi cient) and 12 from the high RFI (HRFI, less effi cient) were used. Individual performance data was recorded for 5 wk. At the end of the experimental period, ADFI of LRFI pigs was less (P < 0.001), ADG not different between the 2 lines (P = 0.72) but the G:F of LRFI pigs was greater than for HRFI pigs (P = 0.019). Serum endotoxin concentration (P < 0.01) and the acute phase protein haptoglobin (P < 0.05) were greater in HRFI pigs. Transepithelial resistance of the ileum, transport of fl uorescein isothiocyanate labeled-Dextran and-LPS in ileum and colon, as well as tight junction protein mRNA expression in ileum, did not differ between the lines, indicating the 2 lines did not differ in transport characteristics at the intestinal level. Ileum infl ammatory markers, myeloperoxidase (P < 0.05) and IL-8 (P < 0.10), were found to be greater in HRFI pigs. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity was signifi cantly increased in the LRFI pigs in ileum and liver tissues and negatively correlated with blood endotoxin (P < 0.05). Lysozyme activity in the liver was not different between the lines; however, the LRFI pigs had a twofold greater lysozyme activity in ileum (P < 0.05). Despite the difference in their activity, ALP or lysozyme mRNA expression was not different between the lines in either tissue. Decreased endotoxin and infl ammatory markers and the enhanced activities of antimicrobial enzymes in the LRFI line may not fully explain the difference in the FE between the lines, but they have the potential to prevent the growth potential in HRFI pigs. Further studies are needed to identify the other mechanisms that may contribute to the greater endotoxin and acute phase proteins in the HRFI pigs and the greater FE in the LRFI pigs.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Improved feed effi ciency (FE) has become a major goal in pig research and breeding programs for economic, environmental and food security reasons.

Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a Gram negative bacterial outer membrane component referred also as endotoxin, is a chronic innate immune stimulator in pigs (Webel et al., 1997; Gabler et al., 2008; Weber and Kerr, 2008) . Importantly, Gram negative bacteria are present in the gastrointestinal tract in large amounts and can serve as a major source of systemic endotoxin (Ravin et al., 1960; Cani and Delzenne, 2010) . However, intestinal barrier integrity plays critical host defense functions against luminal immunogens such as endotoxin. Once in circulation, endotoxin activates the immune system via toll like receptors (TLR), which result in cytokine and acute phase protein production and the repartitioning of nutrients for immune function, rather than toward anabolism (Kimball et al., 2003; Rakhshandeh and de Lange, 2012) .

Although, characterization of intestinal microbial populations was not within the scope of this study, we cannot rule out RFI line specifi c differences in Enterobacteriaceae populations that may partially explain the increase in circulating endotoxin. Interestingly, the presence of greater circulating endotoxin also has the potential to affect intestinal health and function (Gardiner et al., 1995; Albin et al., 2007) . As such, we reported greater ileal MPO activity and IL-8 protein expression in the HRFI pigs with augmented serum endotoxin. Both of these markers are commonly used for assessing intestinal infl ammation and neutrophil infi ltration (Suzuki et al., 1983) . Remarkably, little has been reported with regard to pig FE and \"leaky\" or porous gut and intestinal integrity. No differences between the lines were observed in intestinal TER. This was corroborated further by no differences in the paracellular transport of 4.4 kDa FITC-Dextran or FITC-LPS. Although decreased expression of tight junction proteins claudin 3 and 4 during infl ammation have been implicated in increased intestinal permeability (Pinton et al., 2010) , the mRNA expressions of occludin, claudins 3 and 4 were not different between the our pig lines. These data agree with the intestinal integrity LPS challenge data reported by Albin et al. (2007) . Altogether, these data indicate that in healthy pigs, intestinal integrity is tightly controlled and may not contribute significantly to differences in FE.

The presence of greater blood endotoxin has the potential to contribute to the development of an infl ammatory state and reduce growth potential. In our study, serum endotoxin and the acute phase protein, haptoglobin, were found to be signifi cantly lower in the LRFI pigs. Our values for haptoglobin, CRP and LBP are in agreement with the values reported in non-challenged pigs (Barbe et al., 2011; Diack et al., 2011) . However, serum concentrations of acute-phase proteins are known to increase after stress and infl ammation (Pineiro et al., 2007; Pineiro et al., 2009) and the magnitude of the response is generally related to the severity of the stress or disease (Hall et al., 1992; Murata et al., 2004; Williams et al., 2009) . Even though our pigs were considered healthy, we observed an acute increase in serum haptoglobin and CRP in our HRFI gilts, compared with their LRFI, more FE counterparts. Although diffi cult to interpret, we speculate that an increase in acute phase proteins is a response to acute tissue damage, infl ammation or stress. Studies have reported no straight forward correlations with LPS and acute phase proteins in pig serum (Van Gucht et al., 2006) .

The potential biological process that might account for the decreased endotoxin concentrations in the LRFI pigs may include the greater effi ciency in endotoxin clearance, neutralization or detoxifi cation. These processes occur in various tissues, including immune cells, liver, kidney and intestine. Furthermore, various binding proteins and enzymes such as ALP, lysozyme, and AOAH are involved (Munford et al., 2009) . Alkaline phosphatase is a hydrolase enzyme present in liver, intestine and kidney tubules and it dephosphorylates bacterial LPS and reduces its toxicity (Poelstra et al., 1997; Bates et al., 2007) . Greater ALP activity in both liver and ileum of LRFI pigs indicates that they deactivated or neutralized endotoxin more effi ciently. It is speculated that pigs are vulnerable to enteric infections and susceptible diarrhea, and growth-check due to compromised mucosal alkaline phosphatase (Lackeyram et al., 2010) . Further, intestinal ALP reduces trans-mucosal passage of bacteria and also protects against LPS-induced infl ammation (Lall\u00e8s, 2010) .
