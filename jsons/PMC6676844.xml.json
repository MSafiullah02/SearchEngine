NCIPH is a vascular disorder of the liver, a consequence of chronic microangiopathy of portal vein branches, leading to intrahepatic portal vein occlusion. In addition to the original description of this disease from India, publication of other seminal research work from India789101112131415 led to the question as to why this disease was so common in India16.",

ADAMTS13 is an enzyme which cleaves vWF multimers. Uncleaved ultralarge vWF multimers are extremely adhesive and favour platelets to stick onto the activated endothelium. It has been postulated that endothelial activation (vWF is an endothelial protein) leads to platelet plugs in the microcirculation in the liver in NCIPH1718.",

Release of pro-inflammatory cytokines in response to the chronic inflammatory stimulus from the intestine can activate the endothelium to release vWF into portal circulation7980. It is likely that chronic low-grade inflammatory stimuli released from the gut trigger vWF expression on portal venous endothelium, with potential to promote platelet sequestration and occlusion of portal vein radicles causing NCIPH. ADAMTS13 is a vWF-cleaving protease synthesized almost exclusively by hepatic stellate cells. In advancing cirrhosis, as liver synthetic functions decrease, the plasma levels of ADAMTS13 also decrease. In a study of 142 hepatitis C-infected patients, mean plasma ADAMTS13 levels were 87, 79, 63 and 31 per cent in chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis in Child's A, B and C classes, respectively. Severe ADAMTS13 deficiency was seen in five patients in Child's C cirrhosis81. In contrast, two studies of NCIPH patients from Birmingham, UK17 and at Vellore, India18 have documentedsevere ADAMTS13 deficiency in 10 to 28 per cent despite most patients having well-preserved liver functions. This suggests that ADAMTS13 deficiency may be a primary event and involved in pathogenesis of NCIPH; in contrast to being a secondary phenomenon due to reduced liver synthetic function in advanced cirrhosis because of hepatitis C. The association of ADAMTS13 deficiency in NCIPH patients is being increasingly recognized82.",
