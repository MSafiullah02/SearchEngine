Data determined: IC 50 [concentration of the test substance (mM) required for 50% inhibition of COX-2 measured using ELISA technique an celecoxib, diclofenac, and rofenoxib as positive controls]. Computational methods: Molecular modeling [each compound was represented by a 3PP fingerprint using the fingerprint generator in the software suite MOE v2004.05, an individual 3PP feature was a triangle, all possible triangles with their vertexes located at the atom centers of a molecule were considered, presence or absence of a certain triangle defined the \"on\" (i.e., bit is set) or \"off\" state of the corresponding bit in the fingerprint, the vertex could be either donor (D), acceptor (A), polar (P), donor and planar (D)), acceptor and planar (A)), hydrophobic (H), and hydrophobic and planar (H)) as defined by the rule-based atom-typer implemented in MOE which follows the PAT-TY atom-type definition, SVM was used to constructs a surface in the n-dimensional space that separated active from inactive compounds, where 3PPs were employed to describe a molecule]; SVM [Support Vector Machine, a novel learning machine, based on the idea of mapping the data into a higher-dimensional feature space via a non-linear mapping and then to perform linear regression in this space, where e is a constant parameter depending on the noise of present in the data, and g is a constant parameter of the kernel controlling the amplitude of the Gaussian function, the SVM constructs a surface in the n dimensional space that separates active from inactive compounds]. Results: SVMs were trained to predict COX-2 and thrombin inhibitors. Trained classifiers were obtained using sets of known COX-2 and thrombin inhibitors as \"positive examples\" and a large collection of screening compounds as \"negative examples\". The ligands were encoded by topological pharmacophore-point triangles. In a retrospective virtual screening, 50 -90% of the known active inhibitors were listed within the first 0.1% portion of the ranked database. Validation of the constructed classifiers was performed by developing a method for feature extraction and visualization using SVM, where potential pharmacophore points were weighted according to their importance for COX-2 and thrombin inhibition. Known thrombin and COX-2 pharmacophore points were correctly recognized by the machine learning system. The extracted potential pharmacophore patterns coincided with known binding models of thrombin and COX-2 inhibitors. Fig. 1 shows the potential pharmacophore points reflecting their relative contribution (weight) to the SVM classifier. In a virtual screening procedure, the number of potential COX-2 inhibitors were predicted and tested. A benzimidazole derivative exhibited significant inhibitory activity with an IC 50 of 0.2mM, which outperformed Celecoxib in the assay. The study demonstrated that the SVM machine-learning method can be used in virtual screening and the results can be interpreted yielding a set of rules for designing novel molecules. The proposed method complements the suite of modeling techniques that have been employed for designing selective COX-2 inhibitors previously. The SVM method offers particular advantages over other machine-learning approaches: (i) the SVM class/nonclass boundary is constructed as the maximum margin classifier, i.e., it does not represent an arbitrary solution; (ii) it relies only on the so-called \"support-vectors\", i.e., those molecules that define the classifier function.

The novel method was applied to the optimization of target specific scoring functions in molecular docking. As test applications the FlexX and Screenscore scoring functions were fitted to the kinase and ATPase protein classes. Starting from random parameters promising results were obtained. Fig. 1 shows the relative mean square errors for five model types and four data sets (data set and scoring function, number of data points, number of complexes, linear, quadratic, k-NN, ANN, ANN ensemble): ATP.ssc, 256, 16, 0.75, 0.36, 0.35, 0.31, 0.23; ATP.flexx, 256, 16, 0.85, 0, 46 0, 54 0, 56 0, 33; Kin.scc, 366, 15, 0, 75 The parameter sets generated showed superior performance within the scoring functions functional limits compared to the original values. The POEM procedure converged rapidly, in the present case within 200 -300 cycles, and led to robust minima of the loss function/parameter landscape, thus rendering the approach appropriate for optimizations of rugged landscapes avoiding of getting stuck in local minima.

Computational methods: Molecular modeling [missing residues and side chains of the protein-ligand complexes that were not part of the active site were added and crystallographic waters were retained, hydrogens were added using either InsightII or Cerius2, in order to remove any unfavorable steric clashes and to optimize hydrogen-bonding patterns, the hydrogen atoms were subsequently minimized utilizing either the CFF force field parameter set or the DREIDING force field parameters in conjunction with Gasteiger charges, two coordinate sets of protein-ligand complexes were obtained (one for each force field) that were then used for training the LigScore1 scoring function, two more coordinate sets for each protein-ligand complex were derived, against which the LigScore2 scoring function was trained, the LigScore scoring functions have been developed by employing the genetic function approximation (theory is given), the van der Waals energy of protein-ligand interactions were computed via a Lennard-Jones 9 -6 potential using van der Waals radii and energy parameters of either the CFF or the DREID-ING force field]; GA (Genetic Algorithm).

Data calculated: Properties (the following properties were predicted using the COSMOfrag methodology: water solubility, soil sorption, logP, intestinal absorption). Chemical descriptors: logP (logarithm of the partition coefficient in 1-octanol/water). Results: A novel tool for high-throughput ADME property prediction and similarity screening based on quantum chemistry, COSMOfrag, is presented. The COSMO-RS method is capable of the accurate prediction of thermodynamic, environmental, or physiological properties. The modified COSMOfrag method utilizes a selection of suitable fragments from a database of, presently, 40 000 DFT/COSMO precalculated molecules and replaces the single s profile with a composition of partial s profiles, selected by the use of extensive similarity searching algorithms. The enhanced performance of COSMOfrag has been demonstrated using five representative datasets. Performance statistics were the following [dataset, n, property, CPU time (s), average CPU time per compound (s)]: pesticides, 107, water solubility, 70, 0.63; pesticides, 53, soil sorption, 40, 0.75; BOSS, 150, water solubility, 150, 1.0; PHYSPROP, 2570 PHYSPROP, , logP, 1750 Abraham, 170, intestinal absorption, 90, 0.53 . The loss of accuracy by using COSMOfrag versus full COSMO-RS calculations has been found to be small (in the range of 0.05 log units). The increased speed of COSMOfrag makes viable COSMO-RS property calculations for more than 100 000 compounds per day on a standard PC CPU allowing high-throughput tasks, especially in life sciences.

Results: GPCR affinity prediction was based on the use of a profiling dataset. A QSAR model accounting for \"average\" GPCR binding was built from a large set of experimental standardized binding data of 1939 compounds tested over 40 different GPCRs, and applied to the design of a library of \"GPCR-predicted\" compounds. The model was able to capture critical structural features for GPCR binding. 360 of these compounds were randomly selected and tested in 21 GPCR binding assays. Positive compounds were defined by their ability to inhibit the binding of reference compounds at 10mM by more than 70%. A 5.5-fold enrichment in positives was achieved when comparing the \"GPCR-predicted\" compounds with 600 randomly selected compounds predicted as \"non-GPCR\" from a general compound set. The model was capable of predicting the strongest binders, since enrichment was greater for higher cutoffs. Significant enrichment was also obtained for peptidic GPCRs and receptors not used to develop the QSAR model. Fig. 1 shows the experimental (ACT exp ) versus predicted (ACT pred ) values for the GPCR average activity of the validation set, where full circles mark the position of the synergy model predictions: when both linear and PNB predictions are available, the corresponding marker is spiked. By contrast, hollow circles mark the predicted values for the molecules failing to be predicted by the PNB approach (the case when the synergy predictions equal the linear model-based prediction). For cases, both linear and PNB values exist, the dotted bars span the range between the predicted values of the linear (plus sign) and PNB models (x sign), respectively. The prediction ability of the model was evaluated by synthesizing and testing a collection of GPCR-predicted compounds on a large series of GPCRs from different families. It was suggested that the model is useful for the design of ligand binding with newly identified GPCRs, including orphan ones. The approach should allow identification of new privileged scaffolds for each of these families and understanding how specific structural modulations provide pharmacological selectivity and specificity.

Indicator variables encoding different group contributions and different physicochemical variables such as p, s, MR and STERIMOL parameters of phenyl ring substituents of the compounds were used as predictor variables for the binding affinity. 3D-QSAR analyses of the same data set using MSA, RSA, and MFA techniques were also performed. The best model with reasonable statistical quality was derived from the MSA (Eq. 1) (method, R 2 , F, q 2 (LOO), PRESS, R 2 pred ): PCA, 0.697, 17.5, 0.585, 28.5, 0.592; PCRA, 0.951, 146.6, 0.898, 7.0, MSA, 0.722, 21.9, 0.650, 22.4, 0.774; RSA, 0.613, 0.582, 19.4, 0.535, 29. MSA revealed the importance of the RNCG, i.e., substituents with a high RNCG value have more binding affinity than the unsubstituted piperidine and phenyl (R 1 position) congeners. The RNCS was found to be detrimental (e.g., R 2 \u00bc 3,4-Cl 2 ) for the activity. An increase in the length of the molecule in the Z dimension (Lz) is useful (e.g., R 3 \u00bc sulfonylmorpholino), while an increase in the area of the molecular shadow in the XZ plane (Sxz) was detrimental (e.g., R 1 \u00bc N-c-hexylmethyl-5-oxopyrrolidin-3-yl) for the binding affinity. The presence of a chiral center made the molecule less active (e.g., R 1 \u00bc N-methyl-5-oxopyrrolidin-3-yl). An increase in the van der Waals area, the molecular volume, and the difference between the volume of the individual molecule and the shape reference compound enhanced (e.g., R 3 \u00bc (CH 3 ) 2 NSO 2 -) the binding affinity. Substituents with higher JursFPSA_2 values (fractional charged partial surface area) like the N-methylsulfonylpiperidin-4-yl group in R 1 position have better binding affinity than the substituents such as 4-chlorophenylamino in the R 1 position. Unsubstituted piperidines (R 1 position) with less JursFNSA_1 values have lower binding affinity than the 4-chlorophenyl substituted compounds. The MFA derived equation shows interaction energies at different grid points, while the RSA model shows the importance of hydrophobicity and charge at different regions of the molecules. The models were validated through the leave-one-out, leave-15%-out, and leave-25%-out cross-validation techniques. The devel-oped models were also subjected to a randomization test (99% confidence level (17), 5600 -5603.",

Results: BBB-nonpenetration is desirable for non-CNStargeting drugs to minimize potential CNS-related side effects. In this study the effect of selection of molecular descriptors on the prediction of blood-brain barrier-penetrating (BBB \u00fe ) and -nonpenetrating (BBB \u00c0 ) agents have been modeled by six statistical learning methods yielding outstanding accuracies of 75 -92% and 60 -80%, respectively. The majority of these predictions gave a substantially lower BBB \u00c0 accuracy, and thus overall accuracy, than the BBB \u00fe accuracy. Of the six statistical learning methods tested, the SVM appeared to give a slightly higher prediction accuracy than the other methods for both BBB \u00fe and BBB \u00c0 agents. It was found that the effect of proper selection of molecular descriptors can improve both the BBB \u00c0 and the overall accuracies of statistical learning methods. Molecular descriptors were selected by using RFE. The method was tested using 415 BBB \u00fe and BBB \u00c0 agents demonstrating that RFE substantially improved both the BBB-and the overall accuracy for all of the methods studied. Differences in the values of descriptors important for distinguishing between BBB-Penetrating (BBB \u00fe ) and -Nonpenetrating (BBB \u00c0 ) agents were the following (descriptor, average BBB \u00fe value, average BBB \u00c0 value): m, 1.89(AE 1.90), 2.92(AE 3.48); e a , 0.01(AE 0.87), \u00c0 0.34(AE 1.36); S hpb , 2.44(AE 2.85), 2.17(AE 3.96); R ugty , 1.18(AE 2.31), 1.54(AE 2.84); dis1, \u00c0 4.52(AE 0.68), \u00c0 4.37(AE 1.01).",

Results: Ligand-receptor interactions for some MHC Class II HLA-DR4 peptide mimetic inhibitors were modeled modeling using several molecular docking and 3D QSAR techniques. The conformations of the peptidomimetic inhibitors investigated were defined by docking them into the known structure of HLA-DR4 receptor employing the GOLD, GLIDE Rigidly, GLIDE Flexible, and Xscore programs. The goodness of a docking result for docking a series of peptidomimetic inhibitors into the HLA-DR4 receptor was judged by comparing the Spearmans rank correlation coefficient computed between each docking result and the activity data taken from the literature. The best CoMFA and CoMSIA models were obtained by using the aligned structures of the best docking result. The structural features selected by a stepwise CoMSIA were transferred into the Catalyst program for an automatic generation of conformations and constructing pharmacophore models for the peptidomimetic inhibitors studied. Most inhibitors were accurately predicted by the best pharmacophore model, the Catalyst Hypo1 hypothesis. The Hypo1 hypothesis was mapped onto the corresponding structures of the inhibitors. Fig. 1 shows the mapping of the Hypo1 hypothesis onto the structure of the peptidomimetic inhibitor Ac-(Cha)OMASL-NH2, where the pharmacophore features indicated are: (A) for hydrophobic, (B) for hydrogen-bond donor, and (C) for positive ionizable feature. CoMSIA investigated all the single or possible combinations of structural features involved in the binding process and identified only two to be statistically important for pharmacophore construction. A q 2 value of 0.71 was obtained for structures aligned by the GOLD docking while that obtained for structures aligned by some correspondence points was only 0.57 for the same H \u00fe S field indexes employed in the CoMSIA studies. The results indicated that the field alignment methods utilized by GOLD are superior to the point alignment method used by the CoMSIA model. The only binding pocket that remained unaccounted by the best CoM-SIA model was p6 which prefers binding with some hydroxyalkyl groups as defined by the M13 phage display libraries by others. This feature is included as D or a hydrogen-bond donor in the pharmacophore construction process by the Catalyst program. Results: The SARS coronavirus 3C-like proteinase is an important drug design target for the development of drugs against severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). In this study a \"flexible\" 3D model has been built for the proteinase by homology modeling and multicanonical MD method and used for virtual screening of molecule libraries. The test compounds were docked into the protease homology model, followed by the employment of a pharmocophore model, consensus scoring, and \"drug-like\" filters in order to improve the hit rate and the success rate of the virtual docking hit list. Refinement of the enzyme with MD and using a \"flexible model\" for docking screening were found to be important aspects of the design. Fig. 1 shows the binding mode of C3930 with SARS coronavirus 3C-like proteinase. 40 Compounds were purchased and their affinities were tested against the proteinase. Three compounds, including calmidazolium, were found to inhibit the enzyme with an apparent K i from 61 to 178mM.

Data calculated: MEP [Molecular Electrostatic Potential (kcal/mol) was calculated using MOLCAD implemented in Sybyl v6.7]. Results: MAT is an important target for antituberculosis drug discovery. In this study a homology model of MAT has been constructed using the X-ray structures of E. coli MAT and rat MAT as templates. The resulting model showed correct stereochemistry as assessed by the Profiles-3D score (Ramachandran plot and good 3D structure compatibility). All structurally and functionally important residues in the active site of Mtb-MAT have been identified that are also present in the E. coli and rat MAT crystal structures and the reported point mutation data. The homology model conserved well the crucial topological and active site features of the MAT family of proteins. There are some differences in the active sites of Mtb and human MAT, which can be exploited to design specific and selective inhibitors of Mtb-MAT. Fig. 1 shows the active site residues of Mtb-MAT (bold) and hMAT after the superposition onto the rMAT crystal structure (1QM4). The residues of rMAT have not been shown as it shares 100% sequence identity to human MAT, in the active sites. Only the inhibitor L-cis-AMB from the 1QM4 X-ray structure has been shown to indicate its relative position in the Mtb and hMAT active sites. These differences appear when one compares the molecular electrostatic potential of mycobacterial and human MAT. The differences in the MEP maps of Mtb and human MAT indicated that selective and specific Mtb-MAT inhibitors can be designed using the homology model.

These ligands were subjected to an in vitro Ca 2 \u00fe assay using the CHO cells stably expressing P2Y 12 -G 16 a fusion proteins. It was found that CysLTE4 and PRPP behaved at the P2Y 12 receptor as agonists with the EC 50 values of 1.3 and 7.8 nM, respectively. Moreover, the phylogenetic relationship of the P2Y, P2Y-like, and CysLT receptors was analyzed based on sequence alignment followed by evolutionary analyses.

Results: Pharmacophore-based design of HIV IN inhibitors was performed employing the Catalyst/HypoGen module using a set of 33 b-diketo-acid HIV IN inhibitors (17 training set and 16 test set compounds) reported in the literature. The derived models showed quantitative predictive ability in terms of activity. The best statistical hypothesis consisted of four features (one hydrophobic aromatic region, two hydrogen-bond acceptors, and one hydrogen-bond donor) with correlation coefficient of 0.96.

Results: Structural basis of AChE inhibition by triterpenoidal alkaloids of type I has been performed by enzyme ki-netics and FlexX molecular docking experiments. Buxamine-C has been found to be 20-fold potent than buxamine-B (K i \u00bc 5.5mM and 110mM, respectively). The results of the docking experiments suggested that the cyclopentanophenanthrene skeleton of these inhibitors precisely fits into the aromatic gorge of AChE (pdb code: 1ACL). It was suggested that the C-3 and C-20 amino groups of both alkaloids mimic the wellknown bis-quaternary ammonium type inhibitors such as decamethonium and interact with the Trp84 and Trp279 residues of the enzyme, respectively. Fig. 1 shows the superposition of both natural inhibitors and decamethonium docked into the aromatic gorge of AChE (pdb code: 1ACL). The C-3 amino group in buxamine-C appears to adopt a good position at the bottom of the aromatic gorge exerting a minimum of destabilizing contacts, which seems to be crucial for the inhibitory activity of such inhibitors. These observations are supported by significant difference between complementarity values calculated for docked buxamine-B (0.3) and buxamine-C (0.5) by the LPC software.

Data calculated: E int [interaction energy between the ligand and the enzyme as well as the total energy of the complex, and the individual energies of the ligand and the enzyme, respectively, were calculated (kcal/mol)]. Results: A novel type of potent glycogen phosphorylase inhibitors were designed using molecular modeling methodologies based on a phenyl diacid lead, W1807. In the absence of suitable competitive binding assays, compound W1807 was predicted to bind at the AMP allosteric site. The allosteric site was located by superposition onto known inhibitors which bind at different sites in the enzyme and analyses of the surrounding protein environment associated with these distinct sites. Possible docking modes of W1807 at the AMP allosteric site were further modeled using the complex crystal structure 3AMV. W1807 was predicted to interact with positively charged arginines at the AMP allosteric site in the docking model. A reasonable docking model was computationally determined and subsequently confirmed by X-ray crystallography. Fig. 1 shows the docking model of W1807 inside the AMP allosteric site. The heavy atoms of W1807 are shown in ball and stick, the GP structure is shown in solid ribbon with helices, hydrogen atoms have been omitted for clarity. Characterization of the binding pocket by FLOG revealed a large empty hydrophobic region near the central phenyl ring suitable for accommodating compounds with larger hydrophobic groups and thus improve binding. Based on the results a fused ring analogues were designed with increased hydrophobic bulk in this unfilled region to improve binding. As predicted, this exercise resulted in a new series of GP inhibitors with significantly improved potency. The new ligands showed significantly improved potency.

Computational methods: Molecular modeling (the structure of the hCA II/type I complex was analyzed by difference Fourier techniques, the model was refined using the CNS program to crystallographic R-factor and R-free values of 0.204 and 0.251, respectively, model building and map inspections were performed using the program O, the stereochemical quality of the model was assessed by Procheck, the most favored and additionally allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot contained 98.6% of the nonglycine residues). Data calculated: rmsd [root mean square deviation () of the position of the corresponding atoms of two superimposed molecular structures]. Results: Crystallographic structure for the adduct of CA II with type I perchlorate, a membrane-impermeant antitumor sulfonamide, showing antitumor activity, has been determined using X-ray diffraction techniques. Fig. 1 shows the view of the active site region of the hCA II/type I complex showing the residues participating in recognition of the inhibitor molecule, hydrogen bonds and the active site Zn(II) ion coordination are also displayed. Examination of the crystallographic structure of the complex reveled the following features: the phenylethyl moiety of the ligand fills the active site, engaging in van der Waals interactions with side chains of Gln192, Val121, Phe131, Leu198, and Thr200. The 2,4,6-trimethylpyridinium moiety is located at van der Waals distance from the aliphatic chain of Ile91 es-tablishing a strong offset face-to-face stacking with Phe131. Other X-ray crystal structures of hCA II-sulfonamide/sulfamate adducts led to the proposal of two principal binding modes: some inhibitors bind with their tail within the hydrophobic half of the CA II active site, defined by amino acid residues Phe131, Val135, Leu198, Pro202, Leu204. A second group of derivatives, including the positively charged sulfonamide investigated here, produces binding with their tail in a different region of the active site, pointing toward the hydrophilic half of it and making an offset face-to-face stacking with Phe131. It appears that this last interaction orients the inhibitor toward the hydrophilic part of the active site, whereas impossibility to participate in this stacking leads to the binding of inhibitors within the hydrophobic half. It was suggested that these findings are relevant for the design of better inhibitors targeting isozymes II, IX, and XII, some of these being overexpressed in hypoxic tumors showing bad disease prognosis.

Data calculated: DP% (posterior classification probability classifying a compound as active or inactive by the discriminant equation). Results: The search for novel tyrosinase inhibitors requires the study of the role of tyrosinase in hyperpigmentation and melanogenesis disorders. In this study novel tyrosinase inhibitors were identified by using TOMOCOMD-CARDD descriptors and pattern recognition techniques for finding functions that discriminate between potent tyrosinase inhibitor compounds and inactive ones. Significant LDA models were developed and globally good classifications of 93.51% and 92.46% were achieved for the best models using non-stochastic and stochastic linear indices respectively, in the training set. For external prediction sets accurate classifications of 91.67% and 89.44% were obtained. Fig. 1 shows the plot of the DP% calculated by one of the developed equations using stochastic linear indices for each compound in the training and test sets (the compounds 1 -183 and 184 -246 are active (tyrosinase inhibitors) in training and test sets, respectively; chemicals 247 -541 and 542 -658 are inactive (non-inhibitors of tyrosinase)in both training and test sets, respectively. The new method increases the speed of the discovery of new lead-like compounds, as a suitable alternative to the screening and in vitro assay.

A good concordance was shown between the theoretical and experimental results.

Results: Theoretical and experimental design of atypical kinase inhibitors has been performed and applied to the p38 MAP kinase. More specifically, 5 mimics of the benzimidazolone nucleus found in inhibitors of p38 kinase were proposed, and their theoretical potential as bioisosteres were investigated. A set of calculated descriptors relevant to the anticipated binding interaction for the bioisostere fragments were calculated. The design considerations and synthesis of p38 inhibitors based on these H-bond acceptor fragments are described in detail. Fig. 1 shows the cartoon representation of p38a/SB-203580 complex 1IAN of a benzimidazolone in the active site of p38a. Comparative evaluation of the pyridine-, benzimidazolone-, benzotriazole-, and triazolopyridine-fragment containing inhibitors shows the triazoles type II and IV to be significantly more potent experimentally than the benzimidazolone structure of type II after which they were modeled. An X-ray crystal structure of type IV bound to the active site showed that the triazole group serves as the H-bond acceptor but unexpectedly as a dual acceptor, inducing movement of the crossover connection of p38R. Fig. 2 shows the X-ray structure of type IV bound to p38a. As a result of the study, significantly more potent compounds were identified with superior calculated physicochemical properties than the benzimidazolone group that they were designed to replace.

All the tested compounds exhibited nanomolar affinity for the AT 2 receptor, and the best compound displayed a K i affinity of 1.85 nM. Four pseudopeptides were found to be AT 2 selective, while one also exhibited good affinity for the AT 1 receptor (K i \u00bc 30.3 nM).

Results: Recent genome sequencing and molecular cloning projects have identified several enzymes from P. falciparum that may represent novel drug targets, including CDKs which are expected to play a crucial role in parasitic growth. In this study a 3D structural model of Pfmrk, a putative human CDK activating kinase (CAK) homolog in P. falciparum has been constructed. Significant features of this structural model were (i) parameterization of the Mg 2 \u00fe hexacoordination system using ab initio quantum chemical calculations to accurately represented the ATP-kinase interaction; and (ii) comparison between the GOLD docking scores and measured binding affinities for a series of oxindole-based Pfmrk inhibitors of known activity. The refined structural model was evaluated by the docking of a series of known Pfmrk inhibitors. A reasonable correlation (r \u00bc 0.82) has been calculated between the G Scores and inhibition constants (pIC 50 ) validated the accuracy of the developed Pfmrk structural model. Fig. 1 shows the plot of the G Score versus pIC 50 values for the oxindole-based Pfmrk inhibitors.

Analysis of the ligand-Pfmrk binding interactions revealed specific residues (Met66, Met75, Met91, Met94, and Phe143) within the Pfmrk binding pocket that may play an important role in inhibitor binding affinity and selectivity. It was suggested that the Pfmrk structural model developed, together with information obtained from analysis of ligand-receptor interactions, should help the rational design of novel, potent and selective Pfmrk inhibitors as antimalarial agents. Several novel compounds were identified that exhibit in vitro inhibitory activity against Pfmrk. The chemical scaffolds of these inhibitors were distinct from those associated with known CDK inhibitors. (B.

Data calculated: rmsd [root mean square deviation () of the position of the corresponding atoms of two superimposed molecular structures]. Results: In P. falciparum, the two main regulatory activities of polyamine biosynthesis, ODC and AdoMetDC, occur in a single bifunctional protein. In this study, novel features of the P. falciparum AdoMetDC was revealed by structural alignment. The AdoMetDC domain was modeled using the human and potato X-ray crystal structures as templates. Three parasite-specific inserts and the core active site region was identified by homology modeling. The domain was modeled without the two largest inserts, to yield and rmsd of 1.85 from the human template. Fig. 1 shows the important active site residues in the P. falciparum AdoMetDC, with the ligand AdoMetDC, where Glu72 and Glu438 are acidic residues, Phe5 and Phe415 are aromatic residues, and Cys87 is a polar residue. Hydrogen bonds are highlighted using dashed lines. Contact with the rest of the bifunctional complex was predicted to occur on one face of the PfAdoMetDC domain. In the active site four substitutions were identified compared to the human template. It was hypothesized that one of these substitutions may be responsible for the lack of inhibition by Tris, compared to mammalian AdoMetDC. The model also gave an explanation for the lack of putrescine stimulation in PfAdoMetDC compared to mammalian AdoMetDC (in some organisms the activity and/or proteolytic processing) of AdoMetDC is stimulated by putrescine. It was shown that a network of residues that connects the putrescine-binding site with the active site in human AdoMetDC was conserved in the malarial and plant cognates. Internal basic residues were found to assume the role of putrescine, based on the model and site-directed mutagenesis: the presence of Arg11 was crucial for normal activity, while disrupting Lys15 and Lys215 each cause 50% inhibition of AdoMetDC activity. It was suggested that these novel features of malarial AdoMetDC can guide further experimental investigations that may lead to the discovery of parasite-specific inhibitors. (B. B.)",

Results: Among the known non-benzodiazepinic hypnotic drugs acting on the a1 subunit of the GABA-A receptor, zolpidem zaleplon and indiplon show high affinity and selectivity. Following a design methodology including Catalyst pharmacophoric requirements and ADME-predicted properties, a set of compounds of type I as potential hypnotic drugs were designed and synthesized based on the scaffold shown in Fig. 1 . The acyl substituted 3-amino-4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazolo [3,4-b] pyridin-6(7H)-ones were completely devoid of any inhibitory activity (%Bind < 20%), while Zolpidem showed an inhibitory activity of 99.4% (at a concentration of 1.0 \u00b7 10 \u00c0 5 M). This lack of activity could be attributed to two possible reasons: (i) in the pharmacophoric model shown in Fig. 1 Zolpidem shows a hydrophobic interaction of an aryl substituent present in N2 of the pyrazole ring; such interaction, which is not possible for the molecules of type I, could explain the lack of inhibitory activity; (ii) a literature search has revealed that Zaleplon is metabolized by oxidation of the pyrimidine ring to afford an inactive metabolite that presents a lactam carbonyl group at the same relative position of the pyridone carbonyl group of the molecules of type I. It was concluded that the presence of such carbonyl group, the distinctive feature of the applied synthetic methodology, could be responsible of the loss of activity of the novel compounds. (B.

Results: An evaluation and comparison of two different approaches, GRID/CPCA and GRIND/CPCA, that can be used for visualizing the structural differences between related proteins is presented. Ten crystal structures of CDK2/cyclin A and GSK3b complexed with different inhibitors were compared to identify regions that could be potential sites for achieving selectivity for CDK2 versus GSK3b. The study pointed out marked differences in the bottoms of the CDK2-GSK3b ATP binding pockets that guided the optimization to obtain a selective benzodipyrazole CDK2 inhibitor. It had been reported that a bromine substituent at position 6 of indirubin increases the selectivity for GSK3b over CDK2. The superimposition of the crystal structure of 6-bromo-indirubin-3'-oxime bound into the GSK3b and the benzo-pyrazole ligand bound into the CDK2_3 crystal structure is shown in Fig. 1 . The attachment points of the bromine and the gem-dimethyl almost overlap. The two moieties occupy the same area of the ATP pocket (which correspond to the NM3 region, previously described). The gain in selectivity could be associated with two main differences in the ATP pockets of the enzymes. Phe80 of CDK2, the so-called gatekeeper residue that had been often exploited for the design of kinase selective ligands, was replaced by a leucine in GSK3b, and Ala144 was replaced by a cysteine. As a result of these mutations, the CDK2 had a less elongated and less flat buried region at the back of the ATP pocket. The selectivity regions identified using the GRIND/ CPCA approach were in good agreement with those obtained using the well-known GRID/CPCA method. The analysis performed using the GRIND descriptors confirmed the presence of favorable hydrophobic areas near the Phe80 of CDK2 that can be fitted optimally by adding two hydrophobic moieties above and below the plane identified by the benzodipyrazole scaffold. Fig. 2 shows the DRY-DRY GRIND variable able to discriminate CDK2-GSK3b proteins. The nodes A and B indicate the position of the favorable hydrophobic areas at a distance of about 3 from each other. Both methods provided insights on structural features that might be useful for improving selectivity against both GSK3b and CDK2 kinases. In particular, the GRID/CPCA approach was instrumental in rationally designing a novel, potent, and selective CDK2 benzodipirazole inhibitor. (B.

Fig. 1 shows the derived ACE MTree model, where the bold hexagons indicated significant correspondence with potency. The screening yielded enrichment factors up to 71 for the first 1% of the screened database. MTree models developed outperformed database searches using single feature trees in terms of hit rates and quality. The MTree screening procedures additionally identified alternative molecular scaffolds not included in any of the query molecules. Moreover, the new methodology identified relevant molecular features, that are known to be important for affinity to the target. The methodology allows for introducing weights of individual nodes of the MTree model, giving differing importance to these features. Such weights could be derived on the basis of experimental affinity data. (B. B.) ",

Results: The active-site dynamics of the binding of biapenem to monozinc Cpha a-lactamase has been studied employing QM/MM and DFT methods. The quantum region in the QM/MM simulations was treated using the SCC-DFTB model. Biapenem was docked at the active site corresponding to a recent X-ray structure of an enzyme-intermediate complex (code: 1X8I). Fig. 1 shows the important bonding interactions at the active site of the CphA-biapenem complex, where the biapenem is drawn with bold lines.The modeling experiments revealed that the substrate is connected in a metal binding through its 3-carboxylate oxygen, and anchored by several hydrogen bonds between the substrate and active-site residues, particularly those made possible by the conformational change of Asn233. An activesite water was found in a pocket near the lactam carbonyl carbon of the substrate hydrogen bonded primarily with the carboxylate side chain of the metal-binding Asp120. It was proposed that the Asp120 residue, like His118, may serve as a general base to activate the catalytic water. The energetic stability of the metal-ligand bonds and the hydrogen-bond network was checked by MD simulations of both the apo enzyme and the substrate-enzyme complex. The structure and dynamics of the substrate-enzyme complex model provided valuable insights into the mode of catalysis in these enzymes that play a central role in the bacterial resistance to a-lactam antibiotics. The theoretical simulations complementing experimental results provided important details of the process and yielded quantities that would be hard to measure accurately. It was suggested that a molecular level modeling of the binding and catalysis of the metallo-a-lactamases is essential in understanding the origin of bacterial resistance and in designing novel and effective inhibitors.

A steric misfit was identified for the steroidal position 2; Advantageous hydrophobic and van der Waals interactions (enhanced by high polarizability) were found for the 17R-CHdCH-X fragment. The MTD-PLS mapping results were confirmed by the experimentally derived estradiolestrogen receptor binding site contacts based on X-ray crys-tallography data. The results suggest that the proposed MTD-PLS method can yield useful insights for interactions with receptors of unknown 3D structure and, generally, for the steric rigidity of receptor sites. (similarity-based virtual screening based on similarity search, e.g., using Tanimoto coefficient or fingerprint-based similarity searching, the searches are evaluated by the recall at 5%, i.e., the percentage of the database molecules belonging to the same activity class as the reference structure that is retrieved in the top 5% of a ranking of the database); TurboSim (similarity-based virtual screening involving the nearest neighbors of the reference structure); kNN [k-Nearest Neighbors, a pattern recognition method, where the distance (usually Euclidean) between the pattern vector of an unknown and each of the pattern vector of the training set is first computed, the k nearest samples to the unknown are selected and it is classified in the group to which the majority of the k samples belongs]. . Results: A simple way of enhancing the effectiveness of similarity-based virtual screening by using information about the nearest neighbors (NNs) of the initial target structure in a similarity search is reported. In this study the underlying hypothesis was tested that fusing the outputs of similarity It was suggested that the proposed turbo similarity searching approach provides a simple way to enhance the effectiveness of simulated virtual screening searches. The approach requires no modifications to existing similarity software other than the ability to fuse the outputs of the multiple searches to give a single combined ranking of the database structures. In this study 2D fingerprints and the Tanimoto coefficient were used, but any other type of similarity measure can be used that satisfies the similar property principle.
