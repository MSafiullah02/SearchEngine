In this regard, we would like to highlight the fact that many pathological mechanisms reported by the Authors have been linked to the effects of Matrix metalloproteases (MMPs), enzymes that participate in remodeling the extracellular matrix (ECM). Even more interestingly, a significant MMP overexpression has already been reported in a murine model of encephalitis caused by a coronavirus. (Zhou et al., 2005 Apr)",

(Rempe et al., 2016) Furthermore, the Authors also described the mechanism of local release of interleukines , just as other studies in literature have already established the role played by MMPs in mediating bacterial invasion, neutrophil infiltration as well as the cytokine signaling in neuroinfectious diseases.

(Muri et al., 2019 Aug) Moreover, the recent rise in the incidence of Kawasaki disease may further support the conjecture of a SARS-CoV-2 tissue damage mediated by MMPs. (Verdoni et al., 2020) As a matter of fact, Kawasaki disease has already been linked to coronavirus infections and is strongly related to a viral induced epigenetic overexpression of MMP-9.

For instance, it is already well known that MMPs (and in particular MMP-9) contribute to both formation, growth, and rupture of cerebral aneurysms by digesting the ECM, which leads to ballooning of blood vessels.
