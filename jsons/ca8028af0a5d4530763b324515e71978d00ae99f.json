Most viral exacerbations are due to either respiratory syncytial viruses (RSV), coronaviruses, influenza viruses or human rhinoviruses (RV), with RV being the most frequent causative agent. In vitro and in vivo, RV infects the bronchial epithelium and upregulates a range of pro-inflammatory cytokines, chemokines, adhesion molecules, mucins and growth factors, all of which are thought to contribute to loss of lung function and lower airway inflammation [1] [2] [3] [4] . A large number of these mediators are upregulated solely, or in part, by the transcription factor NF-kB. This would suggest that inhibiting the functions of this transcription factor may alleviate symptoms associated with RV-induced exacerbations of asthma. In virusinduced asthma, bronchial biopsies and sputum have neutrophilic and lymphocytic infiltrates [4, 5] , and these cell types are therefore implicated in exacerbation pathogenesis. Due to the lack of a small animal model, there are many unclarified issues regarding the immunology of RV infection, and how this relates to exacerbations of asthma.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 603, "end": 606, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 607, "end": 610, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 611, "end": 614, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 615, "end": 618, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 979, "end": 982, "text": "[4,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 983, "end": 985, "text": "5]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "A recent study has estimated the economic impact of asthma in Germany to be in billions of Euros [6] .

In the UK, one study has estimated the cost of asthma exacerbations to be approximately 3.5-fold higher per patient when compared to asthma patients that did not experience exacerbation [13] . Currently, the medical needs of patients suffering from viral exacerbations of asthma are largely unmet. There is no vaccine for RV or RSV, and the use of influenza vaccines in reducing virus-induced exacerbations remain controversial [14] . Steroids so far have been disappointing in their ability to control symptoms in models of experimental RV challenge of asthmatics [15] [16] [17] [18] , and high-dose steroids remain only partially effective at controlling virus-induced exacerbations of asthma [19, 20] . A range of anti-viral, anti-RV compounds and combinations of the above have been used as therapies for RV infection, these have had variable efficacies in controlling RV-associated illnesses. This review will summarise the current understanding of virus-induced exacerbations of asthma, with a special focus on RV, including the epidemiology, host defence and immunology.

The importance of neutrophils and CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes in asthma exacerbations is supported by several studies [4, 5, 11, 15, [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] . In atopic asthmatics, eosinophils or eosinophil activation are also increased in virus-induced asthma. Given that a mixed aetiology is likely very common [28, 36] , it is not surprising that there is much overlap in pathogenesis. Differences also exist in the way asthmatics respond to viral infection and may affect the outcome of infection and hence disease severity. Although asthmatics have the same incidence of viral infection as normals, they have increased severity and duration of lower airway symptoms and reduction in lung function than normals [37] . A recent study has also reported persistence of RV in children suffering from exacerbations of asthma, with children showing RV persistence having more severe exacerbations [38] . Also, increased levels of RV replication have also been observed accompanied by lower levels of virus-induced interferon (IFN)-b expression and virus-induced apoptosis compared to normals [39] . In certain studies, greater levels of proinflammatory cytokine elaboration and inflammatory cell recruitment are observed [4] . Peripheral blood mononuclear cells from asthmatics when cultured with RV exhibiting lower levels of the T H 1 cytokines IFN-g and IL-12, suggesting that asthmatics may have a defective T H 1 response to viral infection [40] . These data support two important points; firstly virus exacerbations of asthma have different properties to persistent or allergen-induced asthma, and secondly, researchers are still defining the characteristics of viral exacerbations and the populations in the community that are at risk.

The NF-kB or Rel family of transcription factors (p65, p50, c-Rel) are implicated in the expression of over 100 pro-inflammatory genes (for a review see [87] [88] [89] ). NF-kB is sequestered in the cytoplasm by its specific inhibitor IkB, when phosphorylated by upstream kinases, IkB is ubiquitinated and degraded by the proteasome, allowing NF-kB to translocate to the nucleus. The upstream kinases responsible for relaying the signal include NF-kB inducing kinase (NIK) [90] and the IkB kinases (IKK)-aXb [91, 92] , and the more recently identified IKK-i/e [93, 94] and TANK binding kinase-1 (TBK-1) [95] [96] [97] . Once in the nucleus, NF-kB can bind to various cis-acting sites within the promoter of NF-kB responsive genes and promote transcription (depicted in Fig. 3) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 339, "end": 343, "text": "[87]", "ref_id": "BIBREF93"}, {"start": 344, "end": 348, "text": "[88]", "ref_id": "BIBREF94"}, {"start": 349, "end": 353, "text": "[89]", "ref_id": "BIBREF95"}, {"start": 659, "end": 663, "text": "[90]", "ref_id": "BIBREF96"}, {"start": 694, "end": 698, "text": "[91,", "ref_id": "BIBREF97"}, {"start": 699, "end": 702, "text": "92]", "ref_id": "BIBREF98"}, {"start": 746, "end": 750, "text": "[93,", "ref_id": "BIBREF99"}, {"start": 751, "end": 754, "text": "94]", "ref_id": "BIBREF100"}, {"start": 789, "end": 793, "text": "[95]", "ref_id": "BIBREF101"}, {"start": 794, "end": 798, "text": "[96]", "ref_id": "BIBREF102"}, {"start": 799, "end": 803, "text": "[97]", "ref_id": "BIBREF103"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 955, "end": 962, "text": "Fig. 3)", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Importance of NF-kB signalling"}, {"text": "The promoters of GM-CSF, IL-6, CXCL8, CXCL10, ICAM-1 and VCAM all contain NF-kB binding sequences, and NF-kB is required for the expression of these genes following RV infection in vitro [62, 63, 70, 71, 76, 80] .

RVs upregulate pro-inflammatory mediators and cause local inflammation in the lower airway, and this may precipitate exacerbations of asthma in certain individuals. Individuals suffering from viral exacerbations of asthma are yet to be treated effectively, and there is wide interest in a range of treatment options for these unmet medical needs. Specific anti-rhinoviral therapy, IFN therapy, and steroid-based therapies have all been studied in the past with mixed successes. Anti-viral therapies have been classically applied in the context of clinical colds (Table 1) ; however, they have not yet been studied in exacerbations of asthma. With the link between RV and asthma exacerbations now more established, the antirhinoviral treatments Pleconaril and Tremacamra should be regarded as serious therapeutic options. The study of type I IFN therapy in clinical colds has highlighted many problems with this treatment. Dose, delivery and safety all remain important issues for viral exacerbations of asthma. As a deficiency in IFN-b expression has been recently described in asthmatics [39] , type I IFN therapy remains a candidate treatment however. One potential area of further research is combined anti-viral, anti-inflammatory therapy, which may inhibit viral replication as well as treating upper and lower airway inflammation. Another area that has yet to be tested formally is NF-kB inhibition, as many RVinduced inflammatory mediators are NF-kB dependent. The wealth of literature so far reported on RV-induced exacerbations of asthma suggests that the relationship of infection and asthma exacerbation, in particular the cellular and molecular immunological aspects of pathogenesis, is still unclear, and further experimental infection studies are required to better understand these important processes. In particular, how asthmatics may differ from normal individuals who do not suffer from lower airway disease is a priority. There is also a need for further vigorous pursuit of the molecular mechanisms of infection and pro-inflammatory mediator induction, for example, the development of small animal models that will be invaluable for testing these ideas and providing future therapeutic targets.
