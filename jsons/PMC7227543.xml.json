The model below is the author's own, aiming to explain in the context of COVID-19 how the lung engages with LIF to protect lung function after viral entry into the lung's alveoli, as depicted in Fig. 2\n.\u2022The pulmonary alveolar epithelium is a single-cell-thick layer, one side covered by surfactant and exposed to the air within the lung, and the other with an extracellular matrix surrounded by capillaries where gaseous exchange happens.\u2022Alveolar macrophages are resident within the alveolus.\u2022Alveolar Type I epithelial cells (0.2 \u03bc thick) - cover more than 95% of the alveolar surface: these cells are vulnerable to dying during inflammation but are unable to self-renew.\u2022Alveolar Type II epithelial cells (0.6 \u03bc thick) - are numerically dominant and secrete surfactant at the blood-air barrier to retain patency of the alveolar structure to air.\u2022Stem Cell Niche: the Type II cells also represent a stem cell niche capable of cell division and differentiation into either Type I or Type II cells - so regenerating the delicate alveolar structure. These Type II cells are the source of LIF - not only reflecting the \u201cstemness\u201d property of Type II cells, but also providing rapid release of tissue-protective LIF in response to infection.\u2022During Pneumonic Infection, alveolar macrophages are triggered to release inflammatory cytokines: analysis of LIF in response to infection revealed that all inflammatory cytokines induce LIF expression - with the one exception - that being IL-6. IL-6 directly suppresses LIF [9,10] explaining the potency of IL-6 in driving cytokine storm once IL-6 becomes dominant. Note also that IL-6 up-regulates vascular angiotensin type 1 receptor with propagation of oxidative stress and vascular endothelial dysfunction [11].\u2022Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) - the receptor for SARS-CoV-2 [12,13] - is highly expressed on Type II epithelial cells. Here the model predicts that - following infection - cytokines released from the alveolar macrophages trigger Type II cells to produce LIF.\u2022Myeloid-epithelial cross-talk was first demonstrated by Quinton's laboratory [8]. The discrete cell lineages coordinate synthesis of tissue-protective LIF during pneumonia: maximal expression of pulmonary epithelial-derived LIF (Type II cells) was dependent on myeloid cells (alveolar macrophages) - revealing a co-operative axis essential to resist severe disease and ARDS.\u2022Compounding properties of LIF operate - (i) reparative and regenerative, acting on the stem cell niches of the Type II alveolar epithelial cells to maintain alveolar physiology and structure for gaseous exchange. (ii) Control against excessive inflammatory cascade and cytokine storm, where LIF is anti-inflammatory and directly opposes IL-6-driven immunity. (iii) Also LIF is required to protect vascular integrity from inflammation-induced redox damage that may trigger vascular leak and eventual predisposition to sepsis. Overall, LIF's hyper-acute protective responses become progressively reinforced by homeostatic recovery from the primary inflammation triggered by virulent SARS-CoV-2 infection: without LIF, or with insufficient LIF, progression to inflammatory COVID-19 occurs.\n",

Mechanistically, the LIF/IL-6 axis is a simple binary switch first discovered in T lymphocytes operated by LIF (quiescence - Treg) versus IL-6 (inflammation - TH17). Crucially, LIF is able to directly oppose IL-6 activity - controlling against cytokine storm. But over time, background levels of circulating IL-6 gradually increase, tipping the balance between LIF and IL-6 towards inflammation, with reciprocal loss of LIF since IL-6 directly inhibits transcription of the LIF-receptor - in effect making cells blind to LIF [13]. This age-related shift is sometimes termed \u201cinflammaging\u201d. Notably both IL-6 and age are linked to COVID-19 mortality [2,3]: here increasing IL-6, and decreasing LIF, explains why COVID-19 is so dangerous for the elderly.",

Moreover, removal of LIF by treating with anti-LIF results in acute alveolar vascular leak as illustrated in the top right image of Fig. 2.
