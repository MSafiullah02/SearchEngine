The viral genomic RNAs are then packed into viral ribonucleoproteins (vRNPs) with viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase and nucleoproteins (NPs) and exported into cytoplasm for further viral particle assembly and budding at the plasma membrane (Eisfeld et al., 2015). vRNP nuclear export is mediated by the cellular chromosome region maintenance 1 (CRM1) pathway, with assistance from viral matrix protein 1 (M1) and nuclear export proteins (NEP or NS2) (Akarsu et al., 2003, Huang et al., 2013, O'Neill et al., 1998). The vRNP\u2013M1\u2013NEP\u2013CRM1\u2013RanGTP complex is then exported through the nuclear pore to the cytoplasm, where the viral cargo is spontaneously released upon hydrolysis of RanGTP to RanGDP (Eisfeld et al., 2015).",

            "text": "Several studies have described the role of NP in vRNP nuclear export. For example, leptomycin B (LMB), an inhibitor of the CRM1 nuclear export signal (NES) binding domain (Kudo et al., 1999), inhibits nuclear export of vRNP and NP, but not NEP or M1, in virally infected or transfected cells (Elton et al., 2001, Watanabe et al., 2001). In addition, CRM1 overexpression promotes the nuclear export of NP, but not NEP or M1 (Elton et al., 2001), and the interaction of NP with viral genomic RNA, and M1 is sufficient for nuclear export of vRNP (Huang et al., 2001). Moreover, NP directly binds to CRM1 (Chutiwitoonchai et al., 2014, Elton et al., 2001, Kakisaka et al., 2015), and the interaction between NP/CRM1 and a recent identified host factor, nuclear transport factor 2-like export protein 1 (NXT1), promotes nuclear export of NP and vRNA (Chutiwitoonchai and Aida, 2016). NP must also interact with cellular nucleolin, a major component of the nucleolar compartment, to facilitate the interaction between vRNP and the cellular nuclear export machinery (Terrier et al., 2016). In addition to its role in vRNP nuclear export, NP plays other important roles in the viral life cycle, including vRNP nuclear import and transcription/replication of the viral genome (Aida et al., 2012, Cianci et al., 2013, Portela and Digard, 2002, Sasaki et al., 2013). These functional studies support NP as a promising novel target for antiviral drug development.",

            "text": "Inhibition of vRNP nuclear export is an effective strategy for counteracting influenza replication. Treatment with LMB, an inhibitor that irreversibly covalently binds with the C258 of the CRM1 NES binding domain (Kudo et al., 1999), results in retention of vRNPs in the nuclei of infected cells (Elton et al., 2001, Ma et al., 2001, Watanabe et al., 2001). Similarly, Verdinixor, a representative of a new class of CRM1 inhibitor, forms a reversible covalent bond with C258 of CRM1 and thereby inhibits replications of influenza A subtypes H1N1, H5N1, and H7N9 (Perwitasari et al., 2014). Inhibition of vRNP nuclear export by an inhibitor with an unknown target, 14-deoxy-11,12-dehydroandrographolide (Cai et al., 2015), or NP-target inhibitors such as pyrimido-pyrrolo-quinoxalinedione analog (Lin et al., 2015) and 1,3,4,6-tetra-O-galloyl-\u03b2-D-glucopyranoside (Chang et al., 2016) can also potentially diminish replication of influenza viruses. Moreover, targeting of the third NES domain of NP (NP-NES3) by an inhibitor we discovered, RK424, results in antiviral effects in vitro and in vivo (Kakisaka et al., 2015). Recently, using our high-throughput CELAVIEW screening system, we identified another potential inhibitor, DP2392-E10, which targets the nuclear export function of the NP-NES3 domain (Kakisaka et al., 2016). Although the molecular mechanism of inhibition by DP2392-E10 was not validated at that time, our preliminary study demonstrated that the compound exerts an antiviral effect against influenza A/WSN/1933 (H1N1) replication (Kakisaka et al., 2016).",

To further characterize the broad-range inhibitory effect of DP2392-E10, we performed plaque assays to monitor the replications of seasonal influenza A H1N1 and H3N2 including other subtypes, H6N2, H8N4, H9N2, H14N5, and H15N8 in the presence ,,,,,,of the compound. The results revealed that DP2392-E10 decreased replication of all tested subtypes in a dose-dependent manner at the half-maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) range between 12.63 and 34.57 \u00b5M, depending on the viral strains (Fig. 1B and C). Cytotoxicity tests were evaluated in Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) and A549 (a human lung adenocarcinoma epithelial) cells indicating that the compound modestly affected cell viability at the half-maximal cytotoxic concentration (CC50) of 61.25\u00b12.67 and 94.49\u00b17.56 \u00b5M, respectively (Fig. 1C). Viral replication kinetic in the presence of DP2392-E10 showed that the compound decreased replication throughout the assay course (Fig. 1D). These results demonstrate that DP2392-E10 inhibits replication of a broad range of influenza A subtypes.",

To validate the mechanism of inhibition by DP2392-E10, we monitored the intracellular localization of intact NP and another CRM1-dependent nuclear export protein, NEP (O'Neill et al., 1998), in infected cells treated with the compound for 2, 4, or 6 h. In the dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) control cells, NP and NEP were localized in the nucleus at 2 h post-infection (hpi), but most of the NP and some NEP had been observed in the cytoplasm at 4 and 6 hpi (\nFig. 2, left panel), reflecting nuclear export observation of NP and NEP in the infected cells. In the DP2392-E10\u2013treated cells, NP and NEP were still localized in the nucleus at 4 and 6 hpi, indicating that the compound prevented nuclear export of both proteins (Fig. 2, right panel). Together with the results of the plaque assays described above, these data suggested that DP2392-E10 reduced virus replication by inhibition of NP and NEP nuclear export.",

To further confirm that DP2392-E10 inhibits nuclear export of NP-NES3 and NEP-NES2 via the CRM1 pathway, well-known CRM1-dependent nuclear export marker, HIV-1 Rev (Dong et al., 2009, Fornerod et al., 1997), and a specific inhibitor of CRM1 nuclear export, LMB (Kudo et al., 1999), were used. MDCK cells stably expressing Aequorea coerulescens green fluorescent protein (AcGFP)-NP-NES3, AcGFP-NEP-NES2, or AcGFP-Rev-NES domain (\nFig. 3A) (Kakisaka et al., 2016) were treated for 8 h with DMSO, LMB, or DP2392-E10, and the nuclei were stained with Hoechst 33342. CELAVIEW quantification of the green fluorescence intensity from AcGFP-tagged NES domain protein in the nuclear region revealed that DP2392-E10 inhibited cytoplasmic localization of the NP-NES3 and NEP-NES2 domain proteins in a similar manner to LMB (Fig. 3B and C). As expected, DP2392-E10 also inhibited nuclear export of the positive control, the Rev-NES domain protein (Fig. 3D). The inhibition efficiency of DP2392-E10 against nuclear export of NP-NES3, NEP-NES2, and Rev-NES were at the half-maximal effective concentration (EC50) of 7.42\u00b10.01, 12.33\u00b12.74, and 9.93\u00b10.92 \u00b5M, respectively. The comparable EC50 values suggest that DP2392-E10 targets the CRM1 protein to inhibit nuclear export of different viral NES domains. This result confirmed that DP2392-E10 inhibits CRM1-dependent nuclear export of NP and NEP via the NP-NES3 and NEP-NES2 domains, respectively, thereby decreasing virus replication.",

Because our experimental assays used both human (293 T, for CRM1 protein purification) and canine (MDCK, for replication and immunofluorescence) cell lines, we constructed molecular models of unliganded CRM1 from both human and canine. The human CRM1 model retains the basic structural fold of twenty-one HEAT repeats, a common characteristic of CRM1 proteins (\nFig. 5A). We then used Molecular Operating Environment (MOE) to search for small-molecule binding pockets in these models. A total of 45 and 40 pockets were found in the human and canine CRM1, respectively, and the data suggested slight differences in the surface structures of the two proteins (Fig. 5B and C, left panels). Next, we evaluated the binding affinities and conformations of DP2392-E10 and each pocket, as reflected by U_dock docking scores. The highest U_dock score was identified at a pocket near the HEAT9\u2013HEAT10 repeat regions in both human and canine CRM1s (human CRM1: \u221234.8 kcal/mol., canine CRM1: \u221231.0 kcal/mol) (Fig. 5B and C, right panel).

            "text": "Nuclear export of vRNP was originally thought to be mediated by the NEP/CRM1 interaction (O'Neill et al., 1998), but several later studies indicated a role for NP in vRNP nuclear export: for example, LMB inhibits nuclear export of vRNP in a NEP-independent manner (Elton et al., 2001, Ma et al., 2001, Watanabe et al., 2001), and NES-3\u2013defective NP decreases viral production and replication efficiency (Chutiwitoonchai et al., 2014, Yu et al., 2012). Therefore, we speculate that DP2392-E10 decreases viral replication by interfering with both NP/CRM1\u2013 and NEP/CRM1\u2013mediated nuclear export of vRNP. The inhibitory effect of DP2392-E10 on both NP-NES3\u2013 and NEP-NES2\u2013mediated nuclear export functions indicates that this molecule represents a promising lead compound for further drug development. Notably, however, DP2392-E10 may not affect the nuclear export function of the M1-NES domain, which is CRM1-independent (Cao et al., 2012). This study demonstrated a broad range inhibitory effect of DP2392-E10 against replication of seasonal influenza A H1N1 and H3N2 including some other subtypes. Because the NP-NES3 domain is conserved among human, avian, and swine influenza viruses (Chutiwitoonchai et al., 2014), we expect that DP2392-E10 will also be able to inhibit pandemic subtypes such as swine influenza H1N1 and avian influenza H5N1. The inhibitory effect of DP2392-E10 could be further improved by structure\u2013activity relationship analysis, making it available for use in combination with, or as an alternative to, currently approved anti-influenza drugs.",

Our docking simulation results predicted that DP2392-E10 binds at the region around the HEAT9 and HEAT10 repeats of CRM1. This may directly cause a conformational change of the NES binding site of CRM1, or indirectly affect the folding of the HEAT9 loop that is critical for RanGTP binding. Thus, these unusual conformational changes of CRM1 decrease the affinity of binding with the NP-NES3 domain, interfere with the nuclear export function of NP, and inhibit viral replication. This proposed mechanism of inhibition by DP2392-E10 differs from that of LMB or Verdinixor, which directly bind the C258 of CRM1 NES binding site to prevent the CRM1/NES\u2013cargo protein interaction (Kudo et al., 1999, Perwitasari et al., 2014).",

Antiviral activity against intact HIV-1 replication is further worthily verification that will provide a new class of anti-HIV-1 inhibitor based on the Rev nuclear export function for the highly active antiretroviral therapy. In addition, DP2392-E10 is expected to exert an antiviral effect against a broad range of viruses that exploit the cellular CRM1 nuclear export machinery, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (Freundt et al., 2009), hepatitis viruses (Cerutti et al., 2011, Forgues et al., 2001), and herpes simplex virus (Williams et al., 2008).",

The compound reduces viral replication by directly targeting the CRM1 protein in the predicted region near the HEAT9 and HEAT10 domains, thereby preventing the CRM1/NP and CRM1/NEP interactions. These effects result in inhibition of the nuclear export functions of NP and NEP, which are important for vRNP nuclear export and viral assembly.",
