This report provides an opportunity to recall that rabies is not only an old fatal disease, whose first description dates from the 23rd century BC, but also a re-emerging zoonosis. Although preventable by vaccination, rabies is still not effectively controlled and its true impact is largely underestimated.2\n",

In western Europe, control of stray dogs and campaigns of oral vaccination of dogs and wild animals, especially foxes, has led to a significant reduction in the number of rabies cases. Since 2001, France has been considered free of rabies, and the UK is said to never have had an indigenous case. These satisfactory results are questioned by recent data showing risks associated with illegally imported animals from infected countries,3 and new reservoirs in Scotland in indigenous insectivorous bats.4 In North America, bats are the main vector of rabies, because 32 of the 35 most recent cases of human rabies were caused by bat strains of the virus.5\n",

Molecular studies have estimated that Lyssaviruses have already switched from the Chiroptera to the Carnivora order, probably between 888 and 1459 years ago.6\n",

The reality is less straightforward: in 32 US cases caused by bat strains of virus, only 12 had physical contact with a bat.5 The silver-haired bat variant, responsible for some of these newly emerging cases in North America, is not associated with any known history of conventional exposure. This variant has a unique cellular tropism and can replicate in epidermal cells and then penetrate a nerve. Hence, only a small superficially administered quantity of this virus is sufficient to cause infection and death.7\n",
