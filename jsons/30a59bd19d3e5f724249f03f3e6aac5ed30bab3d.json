The purpose of this retrospective case series study was to describe the clinical and MRI characteristics of histopathologically confirmed intraventricular ependymomas in a group of cats. Five cats met inclusion criteria. In relation to normal gray matter, ependymomas appeared hyperintense on T2W, T2W-FLAIR, PD, and DW-EPI images; isointense on ADC images; and had subtle to strong contrast enhancement. Some variability was seen on T2 * GRE and on T1W images with masses being isointense to hyperintense. Four ependymomas were small and homogeneous, and one was centrally cavitated. All cats had obstructive hydrocephalus, transtentorial herniation, and foramen magnum herniation. Perilesional edema was identified in most cats but was questionable in one. Intraventricular ependymoma should be considered as a differential diagnosis for cats with this combination of MRI signs. C 2016 American College of Veterinary Radiology.",

            "text": "E PENDYMOMAS ARE GLIAL TUMORS arising from the ependymal cells lining the ventricular system and have been reported as a rare form of intracranial neoplasia in cats. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] Among other intracranial neoplasms, the incidence for ependymomas has been described as up to 2.8%. 3, 6 Like other intracranial tumors, ependymomas are often benign in that they do not tend to metastasize, however their location and growth can result in significant secondary deleterious effects by causing vascular compromise and compression of the surrounding parenchyma. 1 Prognosis for feline ependymomas is generally poor. The mean age of cats diagnosed with intracranial neoplasms was previously reported as 11.3 \u00b1 3.8 years (range 0.5-21.5 years). 3 Cats with ependymomas were found to be significantly younger (8.2 \u00b1 3.3 years) in comparison to those with meningiomas (12.2 \u00b1 3.3 years). 3, 5 A mild bias for female cats was seen with ependymomas in one study, a correlation with breed was not established. 5 Surgical excision with resolution of clinical signs has been reported in one cat with a third ventricular ependymoma. 7 Ependymomas can be histopathologically classified into four subtypes (cellular, papillary, tancytic, and clear cellular), although some show evidence of more than one subtype. 5, 8 Furthermore, ependymomas can either be benign or malignant. Malignant characteristics include anaplasia, a high mitotic rate, necrosis, and invasion of neighboring parenchyma. 1, 9 In humans, ependymomas can occur in any age group, but are more commonly seen in children with no clear sex predilection. In humans, ependymomas occur slightly more frequently infratentorially (60%) than supratentorially (40%), with supratentorial ependymomas being more often intraparenchymal/ intra-axial than intraventricular. 8 In children, masses tend to be infratentorial, occurring in the posterior fossa, while supratentorial masses are more common in adults. 8 A supratentorial intraventricular location is more frequently reported in dogs and cats. [1] [2] [3] [5] [6] [7] 10, 11 In cats, most ependymomas have been reported to originate from the walls of the lateral and third ventricles. 2, 3, [5] [6] [7] Ependymomas have been less frequently reported to occur in the subarachnoid space, fourth ventricle, mesencephalic aqueduct, and central canal of the spinal cord. 5 To the authors' knowledge there are no prior reports on the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) characteristics for feline ependymomas.

The MRI characteristics of the masses evaluated included lesion location, shape, signal intensity relative to normal gray matter (hyperintense, isointense, hypointense), degree of contrast enhancement (none, mild, strong), pattern of contrast enhancement (homogeneous, heterogeneous), presence of intralesional cavitations, degree of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) suppression on T2W-FLAIR, secondary effects of the mass including brain herniation, ventricular dilation, and peritumoral edema.

Strong, homogeneous contrast enhancement was present in 4/5 cats, with one cat (cat #5) having mild, heterogeneous enhancement. On T2 * gradient echo (T2 * GRE) images masses were isointense or hyperintense relative to normal gray matter; one of the masses (cat #2) had a central susceptibility artifact on T2 * GRE images. Masses were hyperintense relative to adjacent parenchyma on diffusion weighted echo planar imaging (DW-EPI) and isointense on apparent diffusion coefficient images (ADC). The masses of cat #1, 2, 4, and 5 were fairly homogeneous. The largest mass, cat #3, had multifocal cavitations, which were hyperintense on T2W (isointense to CSF), mildly hypointense on T2W-FLAIR, hypointense on T1W, and nonenhancing, consistent with fluid filled cavities and/or necrosis (Fig. 2) .

In the right ventricle near the level of the intraventricular foramen there is a spherical mass that is hyperintense on T2W (A) and T2W-FLAIR (B) images, isointense to mildly hyperintense T1W (C) on the image, and strongly contrast enhancing (D). There are cavitations within the mass (arrow head), which are hyperintense on T2W images (isointense to CSF), mildly hypointense on T2W-FLAIR images, hypointense on T1W images, and noncontrast enhancing. There is mild dilation of the left lateral ventricle and a midline shift to the left. Perilesional edema is seen as a focal hyperintensity on T2W and T2W-FLAIR images in the brain parenchyma adjacent to the mass (arrow).

Parenchymal herniation resulted in compression of the mesencephalon, cerebellum, and medulla oblongata. Subfalcine herniation, defined as any shift from midline, was appreciated in 4/5 cats. Periventricular hyperintensity was present on T2W / T2W-FLAIR images along the herniated portions of the lateral ventricles, consistent with interstitial edema/transependymal CSF flow. Parenchymal perilesional edema was present ad-jacent to the masses of cat #1, 2, 3, and 5, and was questionable in cat #4. Perilesional edema was most severe in cat #3, with T2W hyperintensity extending along the ipsilateral white matter of the internal capsule and corona radiata.",

In general, hyperintensity on precontrast T1W images has been associated with hemorrhage, protein-containing lesions, fat, melanin, vasopressin, calcification/mineral, and potentially myelin degradation products. 19 Histopathologically, ependymomas may have cyst-like areas representing areas of necrosis or fluid accumulation, while others may have mineralization, cholesterol clefts and/or hemorrhage, which contribute to heterogeneity on MRI. 2, 3, 5, 6 While hemorrhage was present histopathologically in the masses and brain parenchyma of cat #1 and 3, this was not identified with MRI and was likely secondary to procedures (lateral ventricular trephination and craniotomy/encephalotomy, respectively) performed after the MRI studies were acquired.

Further studies would be needed to assess specificity of the imaging characteristics reported versus other intraventricular neoplasms, but this study highlighted some common imaging features and supported the inclusion of this tumor type when considering intraventricular masses in feline patients.

In the dorsal aspect of the third ventricle there is an ovoid mass which is hyperintense on T2W (A), T2W-FLAIR (B), and T1W (C) images and has strong, homogeneous contrast enhancement (D). Both lateral ventricles are symmetrically moderately distended, consistent with hydrocephalus. There is also loss of visualization of the CSF in the subarachnoid space around the brain and within the sulci on the T2W image.FIG. 2. Transverse T2W (A), T2W-FLAIR (B)",
