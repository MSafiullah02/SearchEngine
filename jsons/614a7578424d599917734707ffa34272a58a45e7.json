Animals can carry vast and diverse virus species, most of which we do not understand yet, and the spillover events of the viruses from the unknown pool in animals to human population always occurred in the past. To effectively prevent and control the emerging viral diseases, we should make efforts to explore the unknown virus species in nature and prepare in advance.",

            "text": "Viruses are everywhere on our Earth. Although virologists' efforts have characterized over 5,000 virus species, public health and biosafety may face a global threat due to emerging infectious diseases (EIDs). Most EIDs are zoonotic in origin, capable of crossing the species barrier to infect humans. In December 2019, an outbreak of acute respiratory disease caused by a novel coronavirus emerged, and quickly afterward this disease had spread to more than 200 countries. 1 The disease was named \"coronavirus disease 2019\" (COVID-19) by the World Health Organization, and the coronavirus study group of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses suggested the name of the new coronavirus as \"severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2\" (SARS-CoV-2) based on genome comparisons. Although some patients may have shown certain connections with a seafood and wildlife market, the origin of SARS-CoV-2 has yet to be identified, because some patients showed no exposure to the market. 2 The median incubation period of the disease was 4 days. 3 Most patients have mild symptoms, such as fever and dry cough. However, older patients, those with a higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score and d-dimer >1 mg/L on admission have a higher risk of death. 4 On the other hand, younger patients showed a long incubation period (6.6 days) and fewer complications during treatment. 5 Compared with SARS in 2002/2003, COVID-19 displays higher transmissibility with a lower fatality rate. Common public health measures, such as quarantine of infected and suspected patients, have been taken to prevent and control the spread of COVID-19.",

Vaccines are the best way to prevent infectious diseases at the population level, but their development requires a relatively long time, usually several years. Broadly reactive anti-pathogen drugs are also an effective measure to provide first-line treatment against the EIDs. The Gilead com-pany has collaborated with hospitals to initiate a phase 3 clinical trial of the reactive antiviral drug remdesivir for the treatment of COVID-19. The mechanism of action of remdesivir is associated with the RNA synthesis process by the viral polymerases, which is a promising target for the design of broadly reactive drugs against different types of viruses. 8, 9 Another approach is to mine the databases of old drugs. For example, chloroquine phosphate, a widely used anti-malaria drug, is highly effective at inhibiting SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro. 10 Traditional Chinese medicine also shows potential in the clinic. More effective chemical drugs and monoclonal antibodies are under development to treat patients in the future.",

The pathogens in natural reservoirs can spill over into the human population directly or indirectly after amplification in intermediate animals. To efficiently deal with the potential threat of emerging infectious disease (EID), we should enhance the surveillance of the pathogens in the natural reservoirs and intermediate animals and establish epidemic preparedness.",
