Patients were then dichotomized based on the Youden cut points for each associated outcome. Descriptive characteristics between cohorts are displayed as the median and 25th -75th percentile range or interquartile range (IQR). Variables contrasted between groups were tested with chi square and Fisher exact for categorical data, and for continuous variables a Mann Whitney U test was performed.

These patients were categorized as fibrinolysis shutdown based on the presence of elevated D-Dimer and low fibrinolytic activity; fibrinolysis shutdown has previously been described as LY30 of less than 0.8% but the more complete shutdown seen in these patients results in an LY30 of 0% as a diagnostic cutoff based on the Youden Index for maximizing sensitivity and specificity. Descriptive variables of patient with fibrinolysis shutdown versus those without shutdown are listed in table 3\n. The only significant differences appreciated between groups were patients with fibrinolytic shutdown had a lower incidence of a history of hyperlipidemia and a lower TEG angle, even though fibrinogen levels were similar. Patients with fibrinolysis shutdown had a 40% rate of VTE compared to 5% in patients without shutdown (p=0.013). The time to VTE was significantly shorter in patients with fibrinolysis shutdown (Figure 2\n, Log Rank p=0.001). Overall, 24 of the 44 patients with severe COVID-19 infection in the ICU were placed on full therapeutic anticoagulation, despite only 14 of these patients having documented VTE or arterial thrombotic events; 10 additional patients received therapeutic anticoagulation empirically based on physician concern for occult thrombotic events or bedside evidence of extreme hypercoagulability such as frequent clotting of central venous access or hemodialysis filters.",

This patient cohort had a high rate of renal failure which preceded VTE diagnosis. An elevated D-Dimer was associated with the need for dialysis, while a low LY30 was associated with VTE. Nearly a quarter of these critically ill patients had an LY30 of 0% and D-Dimer >2600 ng/mL and 80% of these patients required dialysis, 50% had a VTE, and 30% had a thrombotic stroke. These results demonstrate that fibrinolysis shutdown correlates with thrombotic complications. Of note, this cohort of critically ill COVID-19 patients was clearly hypercoagulable, despite high normal or frankly elevated PT and PTT levels, demonstrating the importance of using whole blood coagulation assays (which more closely approximate in vivo conditions including the presence of cells and platelets) such as the TEG for improved risk stratification. As a rapid test to demonstrate complete fibrinolysis shutdown, an LY30 of 0% in conjunction with D-Dimer levels over 2600 ng/ml may serve as a sensitive marker for the patients most at risk for VTE and other thrombotic complications.",

In a broad surgical patient population, patients with a TEG MA greater than 68 were 6 times more likely to have thrombotic events including VTE, myocardial infarction, and cerebrovascular accident20. In a mixed medical-surgical ICU population with baseline abnormal coagulation parameters, a TEG-MA of greater than 72 predicted thromboembolic events more effectively than conventional coagulation parameters such as INR, PTT, fibrinogen, or platelet count 21. In a more recent study, a low LY30 suggestive of fibrinolysis shutdown was associated with an increased risk of thrombotic complications as early as 12 hours from injury18. Medical inhibition of fibrinolysis with tranexamic acid has also been associated with an increased risk of thrombotic complications in trauma patients22. TEG MA in this COVID-19 population was universally elevated regardless whether the patient developed thrombotic complications or not, but LY30 strongly differentiated those patients with and without VTE. The first publication to utilize TEG in the ICU with COVID-19 patients drew similar conclusions that viscoelastic testing demonstrated hypercoagulability in this patient population8; however, this study of 24 patients from Italy was descriptive and did not include any outcomes associated with TEG indices. Our results suggest an that TEG LY30 serves as a prognostic marker that this patient population is at risk for thrombotic complications, and may have a better performance at identifying these at-risk patients than other coagulation measurements.",

These results align with previous reports that patients with elevated D-Dimer levels have poor outcomes in the setting of COVID-19 infection7. Elevated D-Dimer and low LY30 have previously been defined as fibrinolysis shutdown in trauma23. This fibrinolytic phenotype has been associated with poor outcomes in trauma24, 25, 26, 27, 28. The cause of elevated D-Dimer levels in COVID-19 patients remains unclear but could be reflective of an excessive amount of intravascular polymerized fibrin. Fibrin acts as co-factor for its own destruction30, therefore a high burden of fibrin will result in elevated D-Dimer levels with minimal systemic fibrinolytic activity. This occurs as there is more reagent that is more readily broken down due to an increase in binding opportunities for plasminogen activators and plasminogen to co-localize. Alternatively, it is possible that a high D-Dimer level could be representative of a viral activator of the fibrinolytic system with subsequent shutdown. Patients meeting this fibrinolysis shutdown laboratory definitions of low systemic fibrinolysis and elevated D-Dimers demonstrated marked drops in D-Dimer over 24-hour periods compared to the other patient cohorts that had mild increased in D-dimer during this time frame. This rise and fall of fibrinolytic activity has been demonstrated in animal models of endotoxin, in which plasminogen activation occurs within 2 hours of intravenous infusion but is followed by an abrupt inhibition of fibrinolysis29. In a study evaluating the addition of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rTPA) to viscoelastic blood analysis of septic patients without evidence of DIC, even low doses of rTPA did not correct the hypofibrinolytic state31.",

In addition, the TEG and other coagulation parameters were drawn at variable times of the patient disease processes. Studies done to evaluate for thromboembolic events were performed for clinical suspicion rather than routine screening and therefore some VTE or arterial emboli were likely not captured or had delays in diagnosis. Clotting of central lines and iHD/CRRT circuits was commonly noted in these critically ill patients with COVID-19 but was not reliably captured in our data set, again potentially leading to an underestimation of hypercoagulable outcomes. Due to the sudden influx of patients with a COVID-19 diagnosis, outcome data are inherently limited since many patients still remain hospitalized and there are logistical hurdles to effective diagnosis of VTE. In addition, less common outcomes such as stroke and mortality would require a large cohort of patients to obtain adequate power to determine if the coagulation parameters we identified that were associated with VTE and renal failure are also associated with these adverse events.",

Defining the optimum predictive test for micro- or macro-thromboses requires further study, however the TEG in conjunction with the D-dimer appear to be a sensitive marker for severity of disease which will need to be studied in a prospective fashion. A TEG LY30 of 0% and a D-dimer of greater than 2600 ng/ml together suggest complete fibrinolysis shutdown and markedly elevated risk of renal failure, VTE, and thrombotic events. The optimum medical therapy to address this hypercoagulable and fibrinolytic state is still unknown, however these results suggest the need to consider therapeutic anticoagulation and potentially tPA therapy to directly addresses the failure in the coagulation cascade of this high-risk group of patients.\n",
