            "text": "This review deals with the avian paramyxovirus Newcastle disease virus (NDV) and describes properties that explain its oncolytic activity, its tumor-selective replication behavior, and its immune-stimulatory capacity with human cells. The strong interferon response of normal cells upon contact with NDV appears to be the basis for the good tolerability of the virus in cancer patients and for its immune stimulatory properties, whereas the weak interferon response of tumor cells explains the tumor selectivity of replication and oncolysis. Various concepts for the use of this virus for cancer treatment are pointed out and results from clinical studies are summarized. Reverse genetics technology has made it possible recently to clone the genome and to introduce new foreign genes thus generating new recombinant viruses. These can, in the future, be used to transfer new therapeutic genes into tumors and also to immunize against new emerging pathogens. The modular nature of gene transcription, the undetectable rate of recombination, and the lack of a DNA phase in the replication cycle make NDV a suitable candidate for the rational design of a safe and stable vaccine and gene therapy vector.",

Among all the viruses used, RNA viruses are rapidly emerging as particularly promising agents for virus therapy of cancer (15) . Integral to the live cycle of all RNA viruses is the formation of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), which activates a spectrum of cellular defence mechanisms involving type I interferons: interferon (IFN)-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2 . Tumors provide a relatively permissive substrate for the propagation of RNA viruses because mutations in tumor cells often cripple the interferon system to allow uninhibited proliferation and to provide resistance to apoptosis (16) . The most promising RNA viruses are attenuated strains of mumps virus, NDV, measles virus, vesicular stomatitis virus, human reovirus, poliovirus, and influenza virus (17) . Although human RNA viruses had the ability during evolution to adapt to the human immune system and to develop immune escape mechanisms, the advantage of NDV is that it is a bird virus that has adapted only to the avian immune system (18, 19) .",

NDV is now classified as an avian paramyxovirus (APMV)-1 in the Rubulavirus genus of the family Paramyxoviridae in the order Mononegaviralis (22) . NDV is an enveloped virus of 100-to 300-nm diameter with a negativesense single-stranded RNA genome of roughly 16,000 nucleotides. These code for six genes encoding six major polypeptides: the large protein (L, 200 kDa), the hemagglutinin-neuraminidase protein (HN, 74 kDa); the fusion protein (F, 67 kDa); the matrix protein (M, 40 kDa); the phosphoprotein (P, 53 kDa); and the nucleoprotein (NP, 55 kDa). By means of an overlapping reading frame, the P gene encodes for an additional gene product, the V protein. The RNA-dependent RNA polymerase involves the proteins L, P, and NP, which are translated in infected cells at free ribosomes in the cytoplasm. The F glycoprotein is synthesized as an inactive precursor (F0, 67 kDa), which undergoes proteolytic cleavage to yield the biologically active protein consisting of the disulfide-linked chains F1 (55 kDa) and F2 (12.5 kDa) (for more details about the classification and the structure of NDV, see ref. 23 ) .",

Use as viral vector for the transfer of therapeutic genes (31) 5. Use as vaccine vector for immunization against emerging pathogens (32) Infection of cells by NDV can be schematically divided into two steps, which are illustrated in Fig. 1 . The first step involves the binding of the virus to a host cell's surface via the cell-binding domain of the HN molecule. This is followed by the activation of the fusion protein F. The concerted action of HN and F leads to fusion of the viral and the host cell membrane. This membrane fusion event allows the viral genome to enter the cytoplasm of the host cell. There, the negative-stranded RNA genome is transcribed into messenger RNA (mRNA) and translated to viral proteins (first step). The proteins NP, P, and L are required for nucleocapsid assembly. The nucleocapsid as \"antigenome\" is then used as a template for viral replication (second step). The M protein and the envelope proteins HN and F, after posttranslational modification, move to the membrane, where virus assembly and budding occurs (33, 34) . In this process, single copies of the NDV genome become wrapped into an outer coat envelope that is made from host cells' plasma membrane. Efficient replication has been observed to be dependent on the genome length being",

            "text": "Tumor cell (30) . This appears to be the basis of the widely accepted fact that the virus is virtually nontoxic in human and for the interest in its use as a form of cancer therapy. Most remarkable is the strong capacity of NDV to induce type I interferon responses by viral protein and RNA (44) ( Fig. 3 ). Viral RNA replication induces in infected cells an innate antiviral program that initiates the transcription of RNA-responsive genes. The responses involve a multimodal machinery of gene regulation by the interferon regulatory factor (IRF) family of transcription factors (45) . NDV stimulates, in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), interferon-induced genes (ISG) such as the antiviral enzymes protein kinase R (PKR), a dsRNA-responsive protein kinase; MxA, a dynamin-like GTPase with antiviral activity; and RNaseL (46) (47) (48) . The latter was recently shown to generate small self-RNA, thereby further amplifying antiviral innate immunity (49) . To clarify the underlying mechanism of the observed difference in virus susceptibility to infection of tumor cells and nontumor cells, we examined the kinetics of interferon-induced antiviral enzymes. The analysis revealed several defects of tumor cells in their antiviral defence responses: they showed no response to UV-inactivated NDV, whereas nontumorigenic cells reacted with induction of high levels of the antiviral enzymes PKR and MxA (47) . We conclude that the induction of an early and efficient antiviral response in nontumorigenic cells could explain the stop of the replication cycle of NDV after the production of positive-strand RNA (47) . In contrast, the tumor cells show a weak and delayed antiviral response (47 , see Fig. 2 ). This observation may explain the continuation of the replication cycle, which leads to high expression of the viral proteins (47) .",

Both lytic strains and non-lytic strains replicate much more efficiently in human neoplastic cells than they do in most normal human cells. Viruses of both strain types have been investigated as potential anticancer agents. One major difference between lytic and non-lytic strains is that lytic strains are able to make infectious progeny virus particles in human neoplastic cells, whereas non-lytic strains are not (50) . The reason for that is that the progeny virus particles made by non-lytic strains contain inactive versions of F molecules. Advantages of the lytic properties of some NDV strains is that the production of infectious progeny virus particles, after a first round of viral infection, gives them the ability to spread the virus in tumor tissues via multicyclic replication ( see Fig. 3 , right). In contrast, non-lytic strains can only perform a monocyclic replication cycle ( see Fig. 3 , left).",

In vivo tumoricidal activity was evaluated in athymic nude mice by subcutaneous injection of 9 \u00d7 10 6 tumor cells followed by intralesional injection of 1 \u00d7 10 6 plaque forming units (pfu) of oncolytic NDV (8) . This treatment caused complete tumor regression in athymic mice with a high therapeutic index (54) . Recently, we characterized virological, immunological, and antitumor properties of some NDV strains. We observed that the oncolytic strain MTH-68/H was the most potent IFN-\u03b1 inducer among all NDV strains tested (54) . After ultraviolet light (UV) inactivation, this strain was the only one tested that could induce in human PBMC antitumor activity in vitro (54) . Upon systemic application of high doses of NDV to mice bearing a virus-susceptible intradermal tumor, no significant antitumor effects were observed with the two oncolytic strains Italien and MTH68/H (54) . The treatment had nevertheless significant side effects as seen by loss of body weight (54) . In contrast, when using a locoregional application system for treatment of liver metastases of luciferase-transfected murine CT26 colon carcinoma cells, MTH68/H showed a significant delay in tumor growth as well as prolonged survival but no effects on body weight (54) . Surprisingly, this murine tumor cell transfectant was resistant in vitro to virus infection and oncolysis (54) . These results suggest: (i) That locoregional application of oncolytic NDV is more effective than systemic i.v. application and (ii) That oncolytic NDV may mediate effects against a virusresistant tumor line, possibly via host-mediated mechanisms For explanation for the in vivo mechanisms induced by oncolytic NDV strains, we therefore have to include host-mediated mechanisms. Those will be dealt within the following section in detail.",

Within 4 h of co-incubation of monocytes with NDV, a strong induction of mRNA for TRAIL is observed (61) . After 14 h, NDV-activated monocytes exerted antitumor cytotoxic activity and killed TRAIL-R2 receptorexpressing tumor lines (61) . This cytotoxic activity could be partially blocked by soluble TRAIL-Fc but not by recombinant TNF-\u03b1 -Fc fusion proteins or inhibitors of iNOS (61) . The task of DCs consists of the uptake, processing, and presentation of antigens as well as the recognition of danger signals. DCs can be produced in great numbers from PBMC-derived monocytes (MoDCs) and the loading of DCs with antigen can be done in vivo as well as in vitro. dsRNA motifs have been described to lead to maturation, activation, and protection of DCs (62) . Antigens from tumor cells can be associated with danger signals from virus infection by the use of virus-infected tumor cells or oncolysates for DC loading ( Fig. 5 ). Dendritic cells pulsed with viral oncolysates were reported to potently stimulate autologous T cells from cancer patients (63) . In this study, DCs from breast cancer patients were pulsed with lysates from the MCF-7 breast cancer line (Tu-L) or from NDVinfected MCF-7 cells (TuN-L, viral oncolysate) and compared for stimulatory capacity in an enzyme-linked immuno spot technique (ELISPOT) response of autologous bone marrow (BM)-derived memory T cells (63) . DCs pulsed with viral oncolysates showed increased expression of co-stimulatory molecules (as CD86, CD40, and CD40L) and induced significantly higher ELISPOT memory T cell responses (63) . Supernatants from such cocultures contained increased titers of IFN-\u03b3 , IFN-\u03b1 , and interleukin (IL)-15 in comparison with cocultures of T cells and DCs pulsed with noninfected tumor lysate (63) . IL-15 is known to drive monocyte differentiation toward DCs and also to have an important effect on cell proliferation and maintenance of memory CD8 T cells (64) . It has recently been described that IL-15-induced human DCs efficiently prime melanoma-specific naive CD8+ T cells to differentiate into CTL (65) .",

We observed also an increase of TRAIL expression on T cells (100) and a Th1 polarization of the antitumoral response (for more details, see the main text and the references 59, 60, and 61).

In the early phase, the retinoic acid-inducible gene (RIG-I) (91) has been shown to function in cDCs and tumor cells as a cytoplasmic viral RNA receptor. RIG-I participates in the recognition of paramyxoviruses and orthomyxoviruses (76) , whereas MDA-5 is central for recognition of picornaviruses (92) . RIG-I binds specifically to RNA containing 5`-phosphate such as viral RNA (93) , whereas mammalian mRNA is either capped or contains base modifications. RIG-1 may thus be able to discriminate between self and nonself (viral) RNA (94) . RNA-activated RIG-1 binds to the Caspase Activation and Recruitment Domains (CARD) containing adaptor protein Interferon-beta Promotor Stimulator Protein-1 (IPS-1) , which, after a further signal cascade, activates, in the early phase, interferon regulatory factor (IRF)-3, which is then phosphorylated, translocates to the nucleus, and induces interferon responses. In the late phase of the interferon response, the secreted interferon molecules interact with cell surface-expressed type I IFN receptors and initiate an amplification loop of the interferon response that involves STAT proteins and IRF-7 (for reviews, see (95) and (96) ).",

The use of autologous tumor cells enables a close match between the TAAs of the vaccine and those of the patient's tumor and includes common and individually unique TAAs. Nowadays, we know that such unique TAAs are the results of somatic point mutations occurring in many different proteins expressed by tumor cells (125) and, therefore, they represent the only true, tumor-specific antigens that are not expressed by any normal tissue. Other possible but less frequent mechanisms for generation of these TAAs, such as alterations in RNA splicing, have been reported (126, 127) . An important additional feature of unique TAAs is their potential resistance to immunoselection in cases in which the mutated protein is crucial to the oncogenic process and thus indispensable for maintaining the neoplastic state or because it is functionally involved in fundamental pathways of cell survival.

The ESb lymphoma is very aggressive and metastasizes to visceral organs, in particular to the liver, killing syngeneic DBA/2 mice within approximately 12 days. After operation of a small intradermal transplanted tumor (5-mm diameter), animals succumb from the outgrowth of metastases derived from disseminated tumor cells and micrometastases at the time of operation. Postoperative vaccination with irradiated ESb vaccine cells infected with NDV-but not with uninfected vaccine cells-was able to protect approximately 50% of the mice (53) . These long-term surviving mice developed tumor-specific protective immunity as revealed by challenging them with ESb and unrelated tumor cells (128) . The effectiveness of this ASI approach was thereafter confirmed in other metastasizing animal tumors, such as murine B16 melanoma (129) , 3LL Lewis lung carcinoma (130) , and guinea pig L10 hepatocarcinoma (131) (for review see (132) ).",

A challenge test using autologous tumor cells without NDV after the vaccination cycle revealed a specific antitumor sensibilization in 12 patients. The DTH response was not caused by bacterial contamination or sensibility to the virus. Histological examination of the vaccination site showed a dense infiltration of predominantly helper T lymphocytes. It was concluded that, in most of the patients treated, ASI led to a specific antitumor response (140, 141) .",

We retrospectively hypothesized that an immunogenic vaccine should contain at least 1.5 \u00d7 10 6 viable tumor cells and viability should be at least 33%. Each cohort was thus divided into two groups: one that received vaccine type A fulfilling both criteria; and the other, type B, missing one or both criteria. Prognostic factors were well balanced between A and B in cohorts (a) and (c). In cohort (a), there was a benefit in survival ( P = 0.026) for type A. The relative risk of dying in the group that received type A as compared with type B was 0.2 (univariate Cox model). In cohort (c), like in cohort (a), the survival benefit for vaccine type A may be ascribed to the vaccine quality, because prognostic factors were not biased.

Direct fluorescence microscopy and immunohistology revealed viral replication in target-positive tumor tissue, resulting in much more EGFP expression than in target-negative tumor tissue (150) .

The production of GM-CSF after infection of the irradiated tumor cell vaccine was shown to synergize with the virus effect and to lead to an increased production of interferon-\u03b1 in vitro upon co-incubation with human PBMC (for more details, see (31) ). DC, dendritic cells; GM-CSF, growth macrophage colony-stimulating factor; Rec(GM-CSF), recombinant NDV with GM-CSF as insert. (157) or influenza virus hemagglutinin (160) ) are high and the foreign genes are very stable after many passages in vitro and in vivo. RecNDV, which was modified by the insertion of a gene cassette encoding the human parainfluenza virus type 3 (HPIV3) HN protein between the P and M genes, was shown to induce a high serum antibody response to the foreign HN protein induced by the first immunization, although somewhat less than that observed after a wild-type HPIV3 infection (161) . However, the titer after the second immunization exceeded the titer observed with HPIV3 infection, even though HPIV3 replicates much more efficiently than NDV in these animals (161) . Furthermore, recNDV completely protected chickens and mice from lethal challenges of homologous and heterologous H5N1 avian influenza viruses (162) . Recombinant Newcastle disease virus (NDV) capsids displaying the enterovirus 71 VP1 fragment was shown also to be able to induce a strong immune response in rabbits (163) . NDV expressing the H5 hemagglutinin gene protects chickens against Newcastle disease but also against avian influenza (164) . A recNDV expressing the VP2 protein of infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) has also been shown to protect against NDV and IBDV (165) . Similar results have been obtained with recombinant NDV engineered to express the SARS-CoV spike S glycoprotein, which protected African green monkeys against challenge with a high dose of SARS-CoV virus (32) . It was therefore suggested that NDV might be a perfect vector for intranasal immunization against newly emerging pathogens (32) .",

A recNDV with tumor-selective binding properties and secreting antibody would allow a high antibody concentration in the tumor microenvironment to be reached, and allow a deeper penetration of antibodies into the tissue of solid tumors. This could then avoid side effects observed with systemic application of antibody. The insertion of genes into NDV for drug activation could be of benefit when associated with the application of an anticancer drug.",

Left : Non-lytic NDV (for example, the strain Ulster ), when added onto a monolayer of tumor cells, leads to the production of viral particles that cannot infect other tumor cells: abortive monocyclic replication. Right : In contrast, lytic NDV strains (for example, the strain MTH-68) lead, after infection of tumor cells, to the production of infectious particles that can infect other tumor cells, thereby leading to an amplification of the viral load: a multicyclic replication cycle .",
