Figure 6 shows four density surfaces created using different bandwidths (1 km and 500m) and cell sizes (1km x 1km, 500m x 500m, and 250m x 250m) . The choices of bandwidth and cell size determine the degree of smoothing applied on a point pattern. A larger bandwidth yields a smoother surface with low intensity levels while a smaller bandwidth a thorny surface with more obvious local variations. Similarly a smaller cell partition produces a pattern that resembles more closely that revealed in a point map but too small a cell defeats the original intent of areal generalization. Bandwidth and cell size need not be the same but the former should be at least as large as the latter. Although the cell sizes used for LISA and kernel density maps in Figures 5 and 6 were the same, the visual impression of hot spots projected by these maps were quite different. The kernel density surfaces appeared smoother and the patterns more contoured. Indeed, they resemble a probability surface of disease occurrence and the patterns are easy to interpret. LISA maps however showed hot spots as a discrete category along with other categories not identifiable on a kernel density surface. Pockets of hot spots buffered by spatial outliers implied that the disease had remained localized. In both cases, the patterns and Moran's I values can inform about areas of concentration or hot spots are but not the severity of the matter. From the observed pattern, we cannot say for certain that the outbreak needs drastic measures of intervention (such as school closures or designated isolation).

Geo-epidemiological models to enable the identification of disease variance in space can help guide interventions for improving the overall conditions of areas with a higher disease burden. A better understanding of spatial distribution of hot and cold spots would help formulate policies to target specific community groups. Here, the spatial process of influenza was examined in terms of variation from Poisson processes. Certain analyses have become more meaningful because of local policies and jurisdiction. For example, movements of primary school students (allocated based on residential locations) are controlled to school districts thereby reducing cross district interaction. Designated isolation of infected primary schools and schools around the hot spots will likely be an effective intervention measure.

From the epidemiological point of view, an outbreak occurs if individuals develop similar symptoms one after another and the disease incidence is higher than usual.

Studies have also indicated that the burden of disease is significantly higher in slums as compared to affluent areas [21] [22] and people of similar socio-economic background and demographic characteristics tend to share similar activity pattern and action space [23] [24] [25] .

We had no specific data about the infected individuals (e.g. residential location of those infected) and thus unable to delimit their zones of active activity even though residential locations and transport preference have been shown to affect transmission patterns [26] . Third, district boundary is artificial. The presence of such a boundary separating infected and non-infected schools will, in no way, reduce the chance of getting infected.

Maps, unlike a printed list of schools, offer a viewable version of the locations or concentrations of a disease which may render a decision, such as school closures, more justifiable. Furthermore, the grid method offers a suitable means of seeing the distribution without disclosing too much detail.
