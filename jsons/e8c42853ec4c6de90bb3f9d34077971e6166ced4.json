            "text": "CEACAM7 is a human cellular adhesion protein that is expressed on the surface of colon and rectum epithelial cells and is downregulated in colorectal cancers. It achieves cell adhesion through dimerization of the N-terminal IgV domain. The crystal structure of the N-terminal dimerization domain of CEACAM has been determined at 1.47 \u00c5 resolution. The overall fold of CEACAM7 is similar to those of CEACAM1 and CEACAM5; however, there are differences, the most notable of which is an insertion that causes the C 00 strand to buckle, leading to the creation of a hydrogen bond in the dimerization interface. The K dimerization for CEACAM7 determined by sedimentation equilibrium is tenfold tighter than that measured for CEACAM5. These findings suggest that the dimerization affinities of CEACAMs are modulated via sequence variation in the dimerization surface.",

            "text": "Carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecules (CEACAMs) belong to the immunoglobulin (Ig) family and are expressed differentially on the surfaces of cells (Gray-Owen & Blumberg, 2006; Tchoupa et al., 2014) . There are 12 CEACAMs found in humans: CEACAM1, CEACAM3-CEACAM8, CEACAM16 and CEACAM18-CEACAM21 (Beauchemin & Arabzadeh, 2013; Tchoupa et al., 2014) . Their functions and roles in cellular processes are diverse and include roles in phagocytosis, hearing, proliferation, signaling, tumor suppression and cell adhesion (Oikawa et al., 1989 (Oikawa et al., , 1991 Benchimol et al., 1989; Streichert et al., 2001; Pils et al., 2008; Singer et al., 2010; Zheng et al., 2011) . CEACAMs are typically dysregulated in cancer and are found to be parasitized by bacteria (e.g. Neisseria meningitidis, Escherichia coli and Haemophilus influenzae) and viruses in mice (e.g. coronavirus) during infection (Dveksler et al., 1991; Leusch et al., 1991; Bos et al., 1997; Sch\u00f6 lzel et al., 2000; Virji et al., 2000; Duxbury et al., 2004; Litkouhi et al., 2008; Obrink, 2008; Singer et al., 2010) . CEACAMs contain an N-terminal immunoglobulin variable domain (IgV), a variable number of immunoglobulin constant domains (IgC2) and either a C-terminal transmembrane and cytoplasmic domain or a glycophosphatidyl-inositol (GPI) moiety by which they are anchored to the plasma membrane (Tchoupa et al., 2014) . Cell adhesion is achieved through the N-terminal domain of CEACAMs, which can undergo heterodimerization and homodimerization in a cis (on the same cell) or trans (across different cells) fashion (Taheri et al., 2000; Watt et al., 2001) .",

The expression pattern of CEACAM7 suggests a specialized function. In fetal tissues of the colon, CEACAM7 is located at the base of epithelial cells and has been found to migrate to the apical surface a few days after birth (Sch\u00f6 lzel et al., 2000) . CEACAM7 contains three domains: an N-terminal IgV domain, a single IgC2 domain and a cell-surface GPI anchor domain (Tchoupa et al., 2014) . CEACAM7 expression is downregulated during the early development of colorectal tumors, unlike CEACAM5 or CEACAM6, which are typically upregulated, suggesting a tumor-suppression function (Sch\u00f6 lzel et al., 2000) . Currently, it is unknown whether CEACAM7 is involved in cell adhesion through homodimerization or if any structural differences exist that could potentially allow CEACAM7 to function as a tumorsuppression molecule when compared with the two known structures of CEACAM1 and CEACAM5 (Fedarovich et al., 2006; Korotkova et al., 2008) . Here, we report the 1.47 \u00c5 resolution X-ray crystal structure of the N-terminal domain of CEACAM7 and have characterized its oligomeric state in solution.",

CEACAM7 was expressed in inclusion bodies in E. coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS cells. Briefly, 1 l of cells were grown in LB Miller at 310 K until an OD 600 nm of $0.6 was attained, prior to induction with 1 mM isopropyl -d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG). Cells were grown for a further 4 h before harvesting (5000g for 15 min at 277 K). The cells were resuspended in lysis buffer [50 mM Tris-HCl, 500 mM NaCl, 1%(v/v) Triton X-100 pH 7.5] and lysed by sonication. Inclusion bodies were isolated (20 000g for 20 min at 277 K), resuspended in lysis buffer, sonicated and isolated by centrifugation (20 000g for 20 min at 277 K). Inclusion bodies were washed with a high-salt buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 1.0 M NaCl pH 8.0) to remove DNA, followed by lysis buffer without Triton X-100. Inclusion bodies were dissolved in 30 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 8.0 M urea pH 8.3 ($5 ml per litre of grown cells), refolded by rapid dilution (1:12 ratio) at 277 K into 50 mM CHES-HCl, 500 mM l-arginine pH 9.2 and left for 24 h. Refolded CEACAM7 was dialyzed against 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0 and concentrated by anion-exchange chromatography (Mono Q, GE Healthcare). A linear salt gradient from 0 to 1000 mM was run at 1 ml min \u00c01 over 15 min, with CEACAM7 eluting at between 50 and 100 mM NaCl. CEACAM7 was further purified by size-exclusion chromatography (Superdex 200, GE Healthcare) in 50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA pH 7.5 and fractions were stored at 277 K.

The overall fold of CEACAM7 is similar to those of the other CEACAMs that have been determined previously. The overall topology is that of the V-set fold of the immunoglobulin superfamily, comprised of two -sheets labeled ABED and A 0 GFCC 0 C 00 . The sheets are connected by the BC, EF, C 00 D and AA 0 loops (Fig. 1b) . The r.m.s.d.s of the CEACAM7 molecules to each other are low ($0.30 \u00c5 ), showing no structural differences within the asymmetric unit. The four molecules of CEACAM7 form two pairs of dimers (Fig. 1c) . The dimer interface is formed from the second -sheet, A 0 GFCC 0 C 00 , specifically the GFCC 0 C 00 strands and the CC 0 , C 0 C 00 and FG loops (Fig. 1c) . Dimerization buries 1610 \u00c5 2 of solvent-accessible surface area as calculated by PISA (Krissinel & Henrick, 2007) . This is similar to the CEACAM1 and CEACAM5 homodimers, which bury 1600 and 1460 \u00c5 2 of solvent-accessible surface area, respectively. The shape-complementarity value (Sc; Lawrence & Colman, 1993) is 0.68, which is smaller than those for the other CEACAMs, with values of 0.81 and 0.72 for CEACAM1 and CEACAM5, respectively. CEACAM7 forms nine hydrogen bonds in the dimerization interface. This is more than CEACAM5 (six hydrogen bonds) but less than CEACAM1 (16 hydrogen bonds). Of the 38 residues in CEACAM7 that differ from CEACAM1 and CEACAM5, eight are found in the dimerization interface. The dimerization constant of CEACAM5 was determined previously to be 0.8 mM by analytical ultracentrifugation (Korotkova et al., 2008) . CEACAM1 does dimerize but forms high molecular-weight oligomers (Korotkova et al., 2008) . The dimerization constant of CEACAM7 was estimated by sedimentation-equilibrium analysis using analytical ultra- in 50 mM Tris-HCl, 50 mM sodium chloride pH 7.5 with rotor speeds of 29 000, 32 000 and 35 000 rev min \u00c01 (blue, red and green curves, respectively).

An estimated average molecular weight of 24.7 AE 0.7 kDa (the theoretical monomer molecular weight is 12 574 Da) and a K dimerization of 95 nM (+20/\u00c060 nM) were measured, a tenfold increase in affinity when compared with CEACAM5. We observed no higher molecular weight oligomers for CEACAM7 other than the dimer.",

Superposition of CEACAM7 onto the CEACAM1 dimer using the same method reveals similar r.m.s.d.s of 0.83 \u00c5 for molecule A and 2.26 \u00c5 for molecule B (Fig. 2b) . Closer comparison of CEACAM7 with CEACAM5 and CEACAM1 shows two major regions of deviation. The first is the BC loop (residues 23-29), which is not involved in the dimerization interface (Fig. 2c ). This region is highly conserved among members of the CEACAM family; however, positions 25-26 of CEACAM7 differ from those of the other CEACAMs. In all other CEACAMs these residues are Leu25 and Pro26. However, in CEACAM7 they are Glu25 and Ser26. The loss of Pro26 is likely to reduce the rigidity of the loop. The r.m.s.d. of this loop in CEACAM7 is 3.10 \u00c5 relative to CEACAM5 and the displacement of this loop causes a slight movement of the N-terminal -strand. Notably, the preceding residue is Asn24, a unique N-linked glycosylation site found only in CEACAM7 and CEACAM4. Three other glycosylation sites are present in CEACAM7 (Asn52, Asn72 and Asn79). These are highlighted in Fig. 2(d) , showing that none are found in the dimerization interface. Glycosylation of CEACAM5 has been shown to be important for interaction with CD8 (Roda et al., 2014) and therefore may also be important for CEACAM7 function.",

CEACAM7 is unique compared with other CEACAMs, as the C 0 C 00 loop contains a single amino-acid insertion (isoleucine) between residues 52 and 53. To accommodate the insertion in the C 0 C 00 loop without altering the length of the C 0 C 00 or the C 00 D loops, the C 00 strand is found to be distorted relative to CEACAM5 (Fig. 3a) and CEACAM1 (Fig. 3b ). The C 00 strand bulges in the center (residues 56-60), causing breakages of hydrogen bonds in the antiparallel -sheet between the C 0 and C 00 strands. The C 00 strand of CEACAM7 is held in place through a hydrogen bond from the O \"2 atom of Asn57 to the N atom of Gly48 (Fig. 3c) .

This buckling of the C 00 strand creates an extra interaction in the dimerization interface, potentially explaining why CEACAM7 forms such tight dimers and has not been found to form heterodimeric CEACAM complexes such as CEACAM6-CEACAM8, CEACAM1-CEACAM8, CEACAM1-CEACAM6, CEACAM3-CEACAM6 and CEACAM5-CEACAM6 (Oikawa et al., 1991; Skubitz & Skubitz, 2008; Singer et al., 2014) .

(a) The polypeptide backbone of the C 0 and C 00 strands of CEACAM7 (red) and CEACAM5 (cyan). (b) The polypeptide backbone of the C 0 and C 00 strands of CEACAM7 (red) and CEACAM1 (blue). (c) The insertion of Ser54 in CEACAM7 (red) results in breakage of the main-chain antiparallel hydrogen bonds and replacement with a hydrogen bond from the side chain of Asn57. This residue also forms a hydrogen bond across the dimer interface to Asn96 (brown). (d) In CEACAM5 (green), only the main-chain antiparallel hydrogen bonds exist. Thr57 is too short to form a hydrogen bond across the dimer interface to Asp95 (purple). (e) However, this is not the case for CEACAM1 (blue). Thr57 forms a hydrogen bond across the dimer interface to Asp95 (gray).",
