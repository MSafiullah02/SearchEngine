HIV is one of the significant health problems worldwide, and about 369 lakh people are living with HIV and 20 lakh new infections are surveyed every year. Overlapping between transmission areas of leishmaniasis and HIV co-infection is very commonly observed (Lindoso et al. 2016). The presence of parasites in peripheral blood of HIV infected patients makes them a source of infection for the vectors (Chappuis et al. 2007). Both diseases target the same immune cells, thus exerting a cumulative effect on the immune system (Pintado et al. 2001). In co-infected patients, HIV modifies the presentation of Leishmania. VL increases the rate of onset of AIDS and decreases the lifetime of HIV infected patients. Also, HIV upregulates the rate of VL to a great extent. This dual response leads to insufficiency in CD4+ T cell immune response, enhancing the severity of disease (Singh 2014).",

After internalization inside phagolysosomes of macrophages, promastigotes begin to differentiate into small, non-motile amastigote forms, that divide multiple times by binary fission, ultimately rupturing the macrophages to infect surrounding macrophages (Liu and Uzonna 2012).",

T cells in lymphoid tissues and spleen are activated both by dendritic cells and the macrophages. The na\u00efve T cells get activated into Th0 cells (intermediate stage) which then travel to the liver and get triggered as Th1 cells on coming in contact with dendritic cells and macrophages in IL-12 environment (Siewe et al. 2016). During this attachment, CD4+ T cells recognize the antigens which are bound to Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) (Dhanji and Teh 2003). CD4+ T cells then produce IL-12, which in turn triggers CD8+ T cells and enhance CD4+ T cell multiplication. Both CD8+ T cells and CD4+ T cells yield IFN-\u03b3, which in turn activates the macrophages to wipe out the parasites (Siewe et al. 2016). The advancement of the disease is mainly related to Th 2 type of immune response along with an increase in levels of interleukin-10, IL-5, IL-4 and transforming growth factor (Torres-Guerrero et al. 2017).",

            "text": "Treatment remains an overwhelming question as different species of Leishmania show various manifestations, which makes the treatment even more complicated (Kotb Elmahallawy and Agil 2015). Despite the availability of different treatment approaches to treat leishmaniasis, therapeutic tools are not adequate to eradicate this infection. These compounds face high cost, drug resistance, toxicity and some other side effects (Ghorbani and Farhoudi 2018). Pentavalent antimoniate was first introduced 60 years ago, and it was the most effective drug with good results (Torres-Guerrero et al. 2017). Pentavalent antimoniate such as sodium stibogluconate is given at a dose of 20 mg/kg body weight for a month, and these drugs can be used both in combination or alone (Akbari et al. 2017). Treatment with antimonials is affected due to adverse effects such as cardiac arrhythmia, pancreatitis, hepatotoxicity and nephrotoxicity (Freitas-Junior et al. 2012). These are also not recommended for pregnant women due to several limitations like parenteral administration (Akbari et al. 2017). Amphotericin B is an anti-fungal drug that is used as a second line treatment (Sundar et al. 2000). Liposomal formulation of this drug is more useful for the treatment of VL (Copeland and Aronson 2015). Miltefosine is the first oral drug for the treatment of VL. It is given for a month at a dose of 50\u2013100 mg/day. Despite its numerous advantages, it has certain side effects such as nephrotoxicity, hepatotoxicity and being teratogenic (Sundar and Singh 2016). The available treatment for leishmaniasis is overwhelmed with resistance to some of the currently available drugs. Mechanism of drug resistance is often related to lower drug uptake, increased efflux, rapid rate of drug metabolism, modifications of drug targets and over expression of drug transporters. The widespread presence of leishmaniasis and appearance of drug resistance reveals the urge to develop and explore novel, less toxic and more promising therapeutic approaches (Yasinzai et al. 2013). Combination drugs for the treatment of VL can be utilized to combat the drug resistance developed by monotherapy. It can broaden the spectrum, enhance the activity of the drug by additive or synergistic action, decrease the duration and dosage, reduce the side effects, the cost of treatment and the emergence of drug resistance (Musa et al. 2012).",

            "text": "Patients once cured of leishmaniasis, are generally immune to second attack of the disease (Gupta et al. 2013). This fact leads to the development of vaccines to immunize the individuals which are at risk of infection (Reithinger et al. 2007). No vaccines are available for humans against leishmaniasis. However, vaccines such as genetically attenuated live parasites; freeze-thawed/heat-killed parasites, recombinant proteins and DNA vaccines are in the process of development (Thomaz-Soccol et al. 2018). The live attenuated Leishmania parasites can be used to develop a successful vaccine (Ismail et al. 2017). However, chances of reversion of attenuated form of Leishmania to virulent form and possibility of attenuated form, causing the disease in immunocompromised individuals is a major concern (Palatnik-de-Sousa 2008). Vaccines with a dead parasite or with fragments are called \u201cfirst generation vaccines\u201d against the Leishmania parasites (Thomaz-Soccol et al. 2018). Other vaccine candidates like recombinant proteins or subunit vaccines are weak immunogens that fail to mount an adequate immune response (Dunning 2009). Vaccines made from DNA have many advantages over other vaccine (first and second generation vaccines) strategies as they are cheap, fast, and simpler to produce on a large scale, they do not require low temperature for transport and storage and can give protection against more than one species of Leishmania and for a long time (Donnelly et al. 2000) But the major concern with DNA vaccine is the risk of integrating parasite DNA into the mammalian genome, which can sometimes result in the induction of an autoimmune disease or cancer (Dunning 2009). However, in light of its many advantages over other Leishmania vaccine strategies, DNA vaccination could prove to be the best approach for use in therapy and prophylaxis against human leishmaniasis (Dunning 2009).",

            "text": "Parasitological methods of diagnosis remain the gold standard for diagnosing leishmaniasis (de Vries et al. 2015) and are very crucial in eco-epidemiological studies (Shirian et al. 2014). Diagnosis in the laboratory can be achieved by direct examination of amastigotes in giemsa-stained lesion smears of scrapping, biopsies, or impression smears (Boelaert et al. 2007). The most frequently used samples are bone marrow or splenic aspirates. However, amastigotes can also be identified in other samples like buffy coat of peripheral blood, lymph nodes, and liver biopsies (Elmahallawy et al. 2014). Of all the samples, the highest sensitivity was observed with splenic aspirates (93\u201399%) (Srivastava et al. 2011). Splenic aspirates are an abundant source of Leishmania parasites, but their examination corresponds to a high risk of hemorrhage in unskilled hands (Barrett and Croft 2012). In a study conducted in India, it was observed that fatal bleeding appeared in two out of 9612 splenic aspirate procedures in a duration of 10 years (Sundar and Rai 2002). Also, one death was reported out of 671 patients that were administered with splenic aspiration in Kenya for a period of 10 years, and three deaths were reported in India out of 3000 (Boelaert et al. 2007). Giemsa-stained bone marrow showed a sensitivity of about 60\u201380%, but the sensitivity of peripheral blood smears was low particularly in patients with low parasitemia (Elmahallawy et al. 2014) and higher in HIV-coinfected individuals (Cota et al. 2013). Although liver biopsies have little risk of rupture and bleeding but identifying the amastigotes is possible only in case of heavy infections (Barrett and Croft 2012). Lymph node aspiration technique can be used when an increase in the size of a lymph node is seen, such as in VL patients and the sensitivity of this method range from 52 to 58% (Boelaert et al. 2007). However, in vitro, cultures of blood cells and tissue aspirates have shown 100% sensitivity (Hide et al. 2007). Cultures prepared from bone marrow and splenic aspirates show high specificity (Srividya et al. 2012) and the highest sensitivity is observed with splenic aspirates (93\u201399%). Being very tedious, exorbitant, and time-consuming, it is confined to research laboratories only (Singh and Sundar 2015). In a study, 155 suspicious patients with CL in Mashhad City were investigated by three diagnostic methods, and the results so obtained were compared. Results showed a sensitivity of 44.5% by microscopic investigation of smears and 48.5% with cultures (Shahbazi et al. 2008). In another study, 62 CL samples were diagnosed using kinetoplastid DNA PCR, microscopic evaluations and parasite culture in Diagnosis and Treatment Centre in Turkey. Results indicated a sensitivity of 54.3% with culture and 71.4% by microscopy. However, microscopy and culture technique when combined together, sensitivity was increased to 88.6% (Zeyrek et al. 2018). Parasites can also be inoculated in the laboratory animals, like mice, guinea pigs, hamsters or rodents (Ready 2014), but this method is not considered as a first diagnostic procedure as several months are required to demonstrate the parasites in these animals (Sundar and Rai 2002). Parasitological methods are most favored and first line diagnostics for determining the disease. However, drawback of the parasitological approaches is low sensitivity, requirement of technical expertise for carrying out the procedure and further risks associated with the tests (Reithinger 2008).",

This test can be both direct, where the labeled antibody binds the antigen and indirect in which secondary polyclonal antibody binds patient that bind prepared antigen. This test is amongst one of the frequently performed tests for detecting the anti-leishmanial antibodies by using the promastigotes. However, cross-reactions with trypanosomal sera have been observed (Boelaert et al. 2004). To minimize the cross-reactions with trypanosomal sera, promastigote is used as antigens (Elmahallawy et al. 2014; Rezvan and Hamoon Navard 2017). A study conducted in Iran to estimate the performance of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for detection of total IgG and IgM, showed sensitivity of 83.6% and 84.7% and specificity of 62.7% and 54.6%, respectively. Sensitivity and specificity of ELISA for detecting IgG1 and IgG4 were 64%, 75% and 85%, 49%, respectively. However, immunodiagnosis of CL showed 91.6% sensitivity and 81% specificity with IFA (Indirect Fluorescent Antibody) (Sarkari et al. 2014). Similarly, in another experiment conducted to compare DAT, IFA, and ELISA, sensitivity, and specificity of IFA was 80.3% and 90.5%, while the sensitivity and specificity of direct agglutination test (DAT) was 70.5% and 100%, and ELISA was 83.6% and 90.5% (Mikaeili et al. 2007).",

This test is dependent on the agglutination of promastigotes of Leishmania that react with the anti-leishmanial antibodies leading to promastigote agglutination (Elmahallawy et al. 2014). The test is economical and easy to perform; thus, it can be used both in laboratory and fields. The sensitivity and specificity of the direct agglutination test as found by various studies ranges from 70.5\u2013100% and 53\u2013100% (S. Mondal et al. 2010). During a study conducted in Spain, the sensitivity of DAT was observed to be 86.4% for suspected VL patients and for individuals underlying HIV infection, increase in sensitivity of 91.3% was seen (Bangert et al. 2018). DAT can be performed on serum, plasma and whole blood (Moody and Chiodini 2000). But, the main drawback of direct agglutination test is that it doesn\u2019t have prognostic value for calculating the cure of disease, as after several years of treatment they remain positive.",

In order to overcome these problems, promastigotes are used as freeze-dried or suspension (liquid) form. The freeze-dried forms can tolerate heat, thus being more heat stable makes the use of new formulated DAT in fields (Abdallah et al. 2004). However, for quick identification (less than 3 h) of antibodies against Leishmania in blood collected on filter paper and in the serum samples, FAST (Fast Agglutination Screening Test) has been developed (Schoone et al. 2001). The sensitivity and specificity with FAST were reported to be 91.1\u2013 95.4% and 70.5%\u201388.5%, respectively (Hailu et al. 2006).",

            "text": "This test is amongst one of the most sensitive serodiagnostic methods for VL. However, the sensitivity of the test relies on the antigen used (Table 1) (Singh and Sundar 2015). Different antigens used in ELISA are:The crude soluble antigen of promastigote achieved by freeze-thawing the live promastigotes. Ryan et al., in 2002, developed ELISA that can detect IgG and IgM antibodies in CL and VL patients and the overall sensitivity is shown by this ELISA was 95.1%.Promastigote of L. donovani liberates excretory, secretory and metabolic antigens within protein-free medium (Martin et al. 1998). Sensitivity and specificity shown by these antigens is 100%, but besides this, retrospective and further multisite interpretations are needed. Romero et al. (2004) described that ELISA showed a sensitivity of 89% using an antigen of Leishmania mexicana and 71% with the antigen of Leishmania braziliensis. In another study, using a sequence-specific peptide antigen in 33 patients infected with CL of L. major observed sensitivity of 67% (Jensen et al. 1999).In a study conducted by Kaul et al. (2000) for evaluation of diagnositic efficacy of 200kDA amastigote antigen of L. donovani, positive antibody response against this antigen and LASA (Leishmania amastigote soluble antigen) was seen in 96.6% and 100% of VL patients respectively.Kaur and Kaur (2013) demonstrated the serodiagnostic potential of heat shock proteins Hsp 70 and Hsp 83 in combination through ELISA and western blotting. Occurance of both Hsp 70 and Hsp 83 suggested that these antigens can be useful for serodiagnosis of VL.Recombinant antigens like rk39, rGBP, Ld-Rgbp, rORFF, etc. have been developed. The surface of amastigotes and promastigotes of L. major express a hydrophilic protein (gene B protein, rGBP) encoded by gene B. L. donovani gene B homolog (Ld-rGBP) encodes a protein that comprises of up to 22 replicas of repetitive element in which 14, 9 are conserved within 2 species (Singh 2006). One more recombinant protein of L. infantum, rORFF has been created for the diagnosis of VL in India (Raj et al. 1999). ELISA utilizing this antigen is reported to be significantly specific and sensitive (Singh 2006). A recombinant antigen, rk39 is demonstrated to be accurate against the antibody that emerges during VL caused by L. donovani. Utilizing this antigen, specificity and sensitivity was noted to be 99% in immunocompetent patients with VL (Singh et al. 2010) and also rk39 ELISA has anticipating values for interpreting VL in co-infected individuals like AIDS (Singh et al. 2005). The rk39 antigen is available commercially now as nitrocellulose papers strip impregnated with antigens and is suitable for using in field conditions also.Carvalho et al. (2018) in their study, evaluated new antigens that were identified by immunogenic screening for serological diagnosis of human VL. It was found that different antigenic L. infantum peptides, based on linear B cell epitopes, had potential for the development of an immunoassay obtained from isolated or multi antigens with ability to improve the sensitivity and specificity values for the VL serodiagnosis.Also, two more recombinant proteins rK9 and rK26 apart from rK39 have been generated from the kinesin gene of L. chagasi. (Singh et al. 2005; Mohapatra et al. 2010). An experiment conducted for comparative evaluation of rK9 and rK26 with rK39 and crude soluble antigen observed sensitivity of 78%, 38%, 100%, and 80% respectively while the specificity of rK9, rK26, rK39 and Crude Soluble Antigen (CSA) was 84%, 80%, 96%, and 72% respectively.",

Delayed-type hypersensitivity skin reactions are recognized as positive, when LST > 5 mm and negative, when LST < 5 mm (Passos et al. 2000). After asymptomatic infection and in a period of weeks to months after treatment against VL, results of the test become positive, showing a healing or protective response (Khalil et al. 2005). Thus, this experiment fails to discriminate between the past or present infection. Furthermore, active PKDL, VL, and DCL are signalized by a negative skin test (Neogy et al. 1990; Rezvan and Hamoon Navard 2017). However, in areas endemic to VL, the sensitivity of this test in asymptomatic infections is similar or even higher than that of other serologic tests (Gadisa et al. 2012). LST shows a higher sensitivity of 86.4\u2013100% and is simple to use (Antonio et al. 2014). Thus, LST is becoming a valuable method for identifying the exposure to Leishmania parasites and distinguishing the asymptomatic cases in epidemiologic surveys (Riera et al. 2008). LST is frequently employed as a measure of the occurrence of MCL and CL in animal and human populations and successful cure of VL, as it prevails negative during active VL and will be transformed to positive after treatment. Despite its benefits, this test is not helpful in PKDL patients as the results are not related to the presence of the infection (Zijlstra et al. 2000).",

Also, PCR techniques are more appropriate than parasitological methods of diagnosis (culturing and microscopy) especially for samples that have lower parasite load (Antinori et al. 2007) thus beneficial in observing the disease progression, estimating the result of anti-leishmanial therapy, describing the species discrimination and drug resistance (Sch\u00f6nian et al. 2011). Moreira et al. (2007) conducted a comparative study of different diagnostic methods and observed sensitivity of 100%, 96%, and 95.65% respectively for symptomatic, oligosymptomatic and asymptomatic groups and specificity of 100%. Similarly, in another study, PCR was targeted against kinetoplastid DNA (kDNA) using Uni21/Lmj4 primers, and the results were compared with parasitological methods, cultures, and smears. The results showed that kDNA PCR was most sensitive, i.e. 100%; however, microscopy and cultures were only 71.4% and 54.3% sensitive respectively (Zeyrek et al. 2018). Abd El-Salam et al. (2014), conducted an experiment in which Leishmania tropica was extracted from CL patients of Kohat and analyzed by PCR, microscopy and culture techniques. Of the 113 samples, PCR, microscopy, and culture showed 87.61%, 53.98%, and 46.90% sensitivity. Although conventional PCR shows enhanced sensitivity when compared to the parasitological method of diagnosis, but an essential drawback of this method is their inability to discriminate between clinically active VL and asymptomatic infections (Sudarshan and Sundar 2014). Also, conventional PCR have a high risk of contamination, which takes a longer time to give the results.",

RT-PCR is fast and has an extensive dynamic range as there is no requirement of opening the reaction tube; also, cross-contamination is decreased. RT-PCR is convenient for diagnosis of PKDL (Ghosh et al. 2018) and canine leishmaniasis where it helps in monitoring parasitic load in different tissues throughout and after the treatment (Manna et al. 2008; Pennisi et al. 2005). In an experiment, 91 PKDL patients from Bangladesh went for skin biopsy, and both real-time PCR and microscopy was performed. RT-PCR showed the sensitivity of 91.2% and microscopy showed 50.6% (Ghosh et al. 2018).",

As the reaction is isothermal in nature, there is no requirement of a thermal cycler, except for heat block and water bath (Khan et al. 2012). All these features of LAMP make it suitable to use under field conditions.

This assay was developed for detection of L. donovani in patients with PKDL and VL. The sensitivity and specificity were found to be good in both the cases reaching a sensitivity of 96.4\u201398.5% in VL blood samples, 96.8\u201398.5% in samples of tissue biopsy and 96.8% for PKDL cases (Verma et al. 2013).

            "text": "In AIDS patients, VL is an opportunistic infection, and unusual pathological presentations of VL in HIV-infected patients create a challenge for diagnosis (Srivastava et al. 2011). However, regardless of the status of HIV, parasitological mode of diagnosis is the gold standard because of its high specificity (Singh 2014). For HIV-infected and non-infected individuals, spleen tissues have the best sensitivity, followed by bone marrow and lymph nodes. However, bone marrow aspiration is most used because of its excellent sensitivity (67\u201394%) and reduced complication than splenic aspiration (Alvar et al. 2008; Lima et al. 2013). Also, culture can improve sensitivity, but it requires a particular medium and is generally not available in endemic areas. Cota et al. (2013) observed specificity and sensitivity of parasitological methods to be 100% and 93.2%. Concerning immunological diagnosis of HIV-infected cases, there are few pieces of evidence of the accomplished tests with significant variety of studies (Cota et al. 2012). Serological tests, in this case, are less reliable. Also, there is confusion about which technique is better than other (Lindoso et al. 2014). As far as a demonstration of antibodies are concerned immunoblotting, enzyme immunoassays, direct agglutination tests (DAT) (Singh 2014; Cota et al. 2012), immunofluorescence assay (Antinori et al. 2012) can be performed with varying sensitivities. Cota et al. (2012) found that in comparison to ELISA, immunoblotting, and DAT had enhanced sensitivity (84% and 81%). Also, Cota et al. (2012) demonstrated in their review which included 33 studies and 1489 patients that serological tests have limited sensitivity and immunoblotting and DAT show better results when compared to IFA and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In another study, including 113 patients of HIV-infected symptoms, DAT gave excellent performance with the positivity of 93%. However, recombinant K39 antigen-based immunochromatographic test and IFA showed low sensitivity, i.e. 60.9% and 45.6% (Cota et al. 2013). Katex (latex agglutination test) demonstrating the antigens in urine sample displayed better specificity and sensitivity in immunocompetent patients of VL, but low sensitivity in HIV-coinfected patients (Singh 2014; Attar et al. 2001). In a study conducted in Latin America on 13 individuals with HIV coinfection, only five were positive with Katex, while DAT showed 100% positivity (Barbosa Junior et al. 2015). The molecular mode of leishmaniasis diagnosis utilizing different Leishmania gene target sequence is becoming essential in both HIV-infected and non-HIV-infected patients (Singh 2014; Lindoso et al. 2016). Benefits of molecular methods are elevated specificity and sensitivity, chances of using bone marrow and peripheral blood (Lindoso et al. 2014). Positivity of PCR differs, keeping in mind the use of bone marrow (93\u2013100%) and whole blood (83\u201398%) (Cota et al. 2012). PCR assays depending on the amplification of kinetoplast are the most analytical method to detect Leishmania DNA (Cota et al. 2013; Lindoso et al. 2016). In their study, Khatun et al. (2017) used MK1F/R primer for targeting the kDNA sequences and found the sensitivity and specificity to be 98% and 100%. Real-time qPCR is a substitute for diagnosis and investigation of infection and shows positivity of 85.7% in HIV-infected individuals in Latin America (Cota et al. 2013; Bossolasco et al. 2003). Despite the fact that this method is a useful tool for diagnosing co-infected patients, it is essential to note that asymptomatic patients can also show positive results (Cota et al. 2013) which makes it relevant for active disease diagnosis in areas endemic to high transmission of leishmaniasis (Lindoso et al. 2016).",

In parasitological methods, the amastigote stage is demonstrated in spleen, liver or lymph node aspirates. Although, parasitological methods of diagnosis remain the best method for leishmaniasis diagnosis but the presence of inevitable disadvantages delays this diagnosis in the field. The serological methods are sensitive, specific and economical. Diagnosis based on antibodies, like rK39 strip test is used in affected countries over the world despite their limitation of remaining positive in healthy individuals for very long periods even after cure. Molecular methods are even more sensitive and are a powerful technique that provides early detection of the parasites. Many molecular methods have been successfully implemented for leishmaniasis diagnosis, but the technique is used mostly in research laboratories, and its application in clinical practices and health facilities requires skilled persons who are generally not available in poor and developing countries. Compared to other diagnostic techniques, molecular approaches remain expensive and require technical expertise. However, efforts should be made to make diagnosis more user-friendly and cost-effective, especially in the remote areas where leishmaniasis is endemic. Leishmaniasis could be prevented by reducing human contact with infected phlebotomine sandflies (the vector), or by reducing the number of infected animals (the reservoir). Although no published studies on the effectiveness of diagnosis for prevention and management of the diseases are present but early diagnosis allow fast treatment and could contribute to the therapeutic success. This can be achieved by training the physicians working in primary health centres for proper identification, diagnosis and treatment of leishmaniasis.",
