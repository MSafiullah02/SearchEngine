Careful preoperative planning including MRI and even core biopsy should 116 be considered in these cases. Nodular fasciitis (NF) is a benign reactive myofibroblastic lesion 117 that may occur after trauma. It also presents as a rapidly growing subcutaneous mass and is 118 sometimes said to be a benign version of a sarcoma. Microscopically spindle-shaped cells in 119 myxoid matrix with collagen are found. NF is positive for alpha-smooth muscle actin, and 120 negative for many other markers (beta-catenin, S-100, CD 34, HMGA2, cytokeratin, EMA, 121 caldesmon, desmin) 22 . Lastly, an intramuscular myxoma should be considered in differential 122 diagnosis. It is more common in women around 50 and often affects large muscles in the 123 thigh or shoulder. In contrast to JAM it shows only minimal cystic changes and has a low 124 recurrence rate even with incomplete resection 1,2,8 .

Activating 126 missense mutations at the Arg201 codon of the Gs alpha gene leading to increased levels of 127 cyclic adenosine monophosphate are detected in intramuscular myxomata (and also found 128 in McCune-Albright Syndrome and sporadic fibrous dysplasia of bone), but not in JAM 16 . 129",

This article does not 64 describe any studies with animals performed by any of the authors. 65 66Informed consent: Approval and informed consent was obtained from the patient of this 67 case report. 1% of all upper limb tumors occur in the hand 6 , so tumors at this body site are not 72 well studied 7 . In our patient the very rare diagnosis of a juxtaarticular myxoma in the hand 73 was established. 74Myxomata clinically present as slowly enlarging mass and do not necessarily provoke pain 5,8 . 75Most commonly they are found in larger joints like the knee 1 , shoulder, elbow, foot, ankle 76 and only rarely in the hand and wrist 9 . Men between 30 and 50 seem to be affected be identified as different types according to their tissue of origin (bone or 79 soft tissue)10  . Deriving from the bone itself myxomata are mostly seen in the jaw, whereas 80 periosteal myxomata often occur in the long bones e.g. the femur 11 . 81Treatment of a myxoma is complete surgical excision. Sometimes additional procedures (e.g. 82 meniscectomy) are necessary 5 . Continued follow-up is important as local recurrence rate 83 after resection is high. Patients should be informed about the necessity for regular follow-up 84 visits during preoperative counseling 12,13 . Previous studies describe a recurrence rate of 34%, 85 often within 18 months after surgery. 2 Incomplete resection may be the reason for this high 86 recurrence rate 1 . In one case a recurrent myxoma lead to amputation of the hand after five 87 surgical attempts 14 . Usually limb-sparing excision is possible in the hand, due to the fact that 88 tumors often become symptomatic when they are still small. The presence or absence of 89 pain does not seem to be applicable for differentiating between benign and malignant hand 90 lesions 7 . 91First described by Virchow in 1863 14 the pathogenesis of myxomata is still not completely 92 understood, but the literature describes an association with previous trauma and osteoarthritis. Neither of these applied to our patient. Whether a neoplastic or a reactive 94 process leads to proliferation of these mesenchymal cells is still unknown 13,15 . When looking 95 for genetic abnormalities in DNA sequencing of myxomata, PCR shows Gs alpha mutations in 96 intramuscular myxomata, but not in JAMs, so different underlying molecular mechanisms 97 are postulated 16 . 98",
