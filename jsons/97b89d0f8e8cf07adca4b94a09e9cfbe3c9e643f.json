While BST-2 has been almost exclusively studied as a mammalian antiviral protein, an in silico study identified a BST-2 ortholog as far back in vertebrate evolution as the elephant shark, dating the appearance of this gene to over 450 million years ago (Heusinger et al., 2015) . Other than in fish, this study also identified orthologs in marsupials, reptiles, and birds, with alligator BST-2 being tested and found to possess antiviral function against HIV-1 release. Among birds, BST-2 was found in turkeys and chickens, but appears to have been lost through gene erosion among many bird species.",

The resulting four-membrane-anchor conformation is considered central to the ability of BST-2 to restrict HIV-1 virion release, where it acts as a \"tether\" linking the membranes of budded virions to the host cell membrane (Perez-Caballero et al., 2009) . As BST-2 acts directly upon the host cell membrane rather than viral components, BST-2 does not target a specific virus but rather has been found capable of restricting virion release and spread for a range of enveloped viruses beyond the retroviruses, such as filoviruses (Jouvenet et al., 2009; Kaletsky et al., 2009; Sakuma et al., 2009) , arenaviruses (Radoshitzky et al., 2010; Sakuma et al., 2009) , and various coronaviruses (Taylor et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2014) .",

Most notably, BST-2 has been described as a cross-species transmission barrier that shaped the evolution of the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) and HIV (Evans et al., 2010) . A recent publication also demonstrated the possible role of BST-2 as a crossspecies transmission barrier for various orthobunyaviruses (Varela 2017), with human viruses being restricted by sheep BST-2 but not the human ortholog, and vice versa. Also, equine BST-2 was observed to restrict the growth of both equine and human influenza viruses more effectively than human BST-2 (Wang et al., 2018) .",

These observations lent credence to the possibility that influenza viruses universally encode an antagonist to BST-2. Contradictory reports soon emerged, however, of viruses inherently sensitive to BST-2 restriction (Gnirss et al., 2015; Hu et al., 2017; Mangeat et al., 2012) . Differential abilities of various influenza virus neuraminidases (NA) in circumventing BST-2 activity (Leyva-Grado et al., 2014; Yondola et al., 2011) made it apparent that influenza virus sensitivity to BST-2 is likely to be strain-specific. Further studies supported the possibility that influenza virus NA acts a strainspecific antagonist to BST-2 (Leyva-Grado et al., 2014; Mangeat et al., 2012) . Mangeat et al. also reported a reduction in BST-2 protein expression, which may be associated with hemagglutinin (HA) and NA together (Gnirss et al., 2015) or the M2 protein (Hu et al., 2017) , but their observations of decreased BST-2 mRNA levels during influenza virus infection remained unexplained. Given the variety of influenza strains, host cells, and methodologies used to study the BST-2-influenza interplay, the conflicting data, at the very least, appear to suggest that a variety of influenza virus strains interact with and counteract BST-2 in some fashion.",

These viruses were used to infect MDCK and MDCK-BST-2 cells at a low multiplicity of infection (MOI), and their supernatants were harvested at 48 h post-infection for plaque titration on MDCK cells. As low pathogenic avian viruses have not been reported to cause disease in humans, we expected that the H4N6 and H6N1 viruses would be more susceptible to human BST-2 antiviral activity than PR8. Surprisingly, the PR8 virus exhibited greater sensitivity to BST-2, with titers decreasing by around 1 log in MDCK-BST-2 cells ( Fig. 2A) . Neither the H4N6 nor H6N1 virus appeared to be negatively affected by the presence of BST-2, with H4N6 showing a slight trend towards increased replication in MDCK-BST-2 cells (Fig. 2B, C) . When infected cells were probed to confirm BST-2 expression, western blotting revealed a dramatic disappearance of BST-2 protein in MDCK-BST-2 cells infected by H4N6 and H6N1 viruses (Fig. 2D ). Similar levels of BST-2 protein down-regulation were not observed with PR8 infection prior to complete cell death. Analysis of BST-2 mRNA demonstrated that this reduction was accompanied by reduced mRNA levels as well (Fig. 2E ). PR8 infection also resulted in decreased BST-2 mRNA levels, albeit not as drastically as infection with the avian viruses. While this result reflects the ability of influenza A viruses in general to mediate host shut-off (Rivas et al., 2016) , it also suggests a difference in mRNA down-regulation that may be associated with decreased levels of BST-2. Alternatively, it is also possible that mRNA and protein down-regulation effects occur through distinct mechanisms.",

The pandemic H1N1 strain (Non), which has an avian-derived PA, along with the highly pathogenic H5N1 PA, had a noticeable, albeit very mild, effect on BST-2 levels. The PR8 and H3N2 viruses had little observable impact on BST-2 levels. PA protein levels roughly corresponded to their effect on BST-2 levels; H4N6 and H6N1 had the greatest amounts of PA protein, followed by the highly pathogenic H5N1 and the pandemic H1N1. PR8 and H3N2 PA levels were notably lower, likely due to the presence of BST-2 itself, which has been previously shown to decrease expression of co-transfected genes (Narkpuk et al., 2014) . Indeed, in the absence of BST-2, PA of PR8 and the H3N2 and H5N1 viruses were expressed at higher levels, whereas H4N6 and H6N1 PA were expressed at lower levels (Fig. 3E ). These results suggest that the H4N6 and H6N1 PA-mediated down-regulation of BST-2 may pre-empt BST-2 activity, preventing BST-2 from decreasing PA expression.",

PA-X has been demonstrated to actively target host RNA polymerase II-derived transcripts for cleavage (Khaperskyy et al., 2016) and is thought to play a role in decreasing host competition for resources as well as down-regulating host responses (Hayashi et al., 2015; Jagger et al., 2012) . In addition, it displays host-and strain-specific impact on influenza virus pathogenicity and transmissibility (Hu et al., 2018) . To dissect the roles of both PA segment products in mediating BST-2 down-regulation, we mutated the PA segment based on work by Jagger et al., which had identified the frameshift motif (UCC UUU CGU C; Fig. 4A ) required for PA-X expression as well as narrowed down the essential residues to 3 positions that resulted in under 0.1% frameshifting efficiency when mutated (UCC UUU CGU C to UCC UUC AGA C) (Jagger et al., 2012) . They also generated a single C nucleotide deletion mutant (UCC UUU CGU C to UCC UUU -GU C) which shifted the PA-X ORF (open reading frame) into a position in-frame with the start codon, resulting in expression of PA-X but not PA.",

Wild-type or mutant PA was co-transfected with a BST-2 expression plasmid into HEK293T cells, and cell lysates were harvested for western blot analysis (Fig. 4C, Supplementary Fig. 2B ). As seen previously, the H6N1 wild-type PA decreased BST-2 levels to a much greater extent than the PR8 wild-type PA. The H6N1 \u0394C PA, which is frameshifted to express only the PA-X ORF, resulted in undetectable levels of BST-2 while the FS PA lost its activity. These results indicate that the effect of the H6N1 PA segment on BST-2 levels may be attributed to the PA-X ORF. Similarly, the PR8 \u0394C mutant decreased BST-2 levels while the FS mutant had no effect, further demonstrating that the PR8 PA-X ORF also has the ability to decrease BST-2 protein levels in transfected cells. However, because PR8 wild-type and \u0394C PA both exhibit less down-regulation of BST-2 protein compared to its H6N1 counterparts, we surmise that PR8 PA-X expression levels or activity may be lower.",

First, we generated chimeric PR8 and H6N1 viruses where the PA, NS or both PA and NS segments were swapped, as well as PR8 and H6N1 viruses carrying the FS mutation in their PA segments. MDCK-BST-2 cells were infected with these viruses at an MOI of 0.001, and cell lysates were assessed for BST-2 and viral NP (nucleoprotein) expression (Fig. 5A, Supplementary Fig. 2C ). The PR8-based chimeras carrying H6N1 NS and/or wild-type PA were capable of decreasing BST-2 levels, with the strongest impact being seen with the wild-type PA segment alone. The PR8 viruses with FS PA, either its own or that of H6N1, did not exhibit BST-2 down-regulation. On the other hand, the H6N1 chimeric viruses carrying either the PR8 wild-type PA or both PR8 NS and wild-type PA completely lost their ability to decrease BST-2 levels. The H6N1 FS mutant lost most of their activity, while the virus carrying PR8 NS lost some activity but still yielded noticeably decreased BST-2 levels. These results suggest that H6N1 PA plays the primary role in down-regulating BST-2, with some contribution from its NS segment. Interestingly, the presence of both H6N1 NS and wild-type PA in PR8 did not result in an additive effect on BST-2 levels, but rather resulting in a weaker effect on BST-2 than H6N1 wild-type PA alone. This suggests that viral context also plays a role in how PA and NS manifest their BST-2 antagonism.",

This would allow us to examine the impact of viral infection on BST-2 levels without being confounded by differences in viral spread due to variable BST-2 sensitivity. Western blotting results reflect our transfection observations, although to a less dramatic extent (Fig. 5B , Supplementary Fig. 2D) , likely due to the single-round nature of these infections. The H6N1 virus resulted in the lowest BST-2 levels, followed by PR8 (H6N1 PA), the PR8 virus carrying the H6N1 PA segment. BST-2 mRNA levels were also examined (Fig. 5C) . Loss of frameshifting into the PA-X ORF resulted in notable losses in the ability to down-regulate BST-2 mRNA, strongly suggesting a role for PA-X in controlling BST-2 transcription. However, swapping the PA segment as a whole did not affect BST-2 mRNA levels significantly. Considering the impact of the PA segment on BST-2 protein levels ( Fig. 5A and B ), this appears to indicate a distinct role for the PA segment as a whole in BST-2 protein down-regulation.",

MDCK or MDCK-BST-2 cells were infected and their supernatants were harvested at various time points for plaque titration on MDCK cells. The growth kinetics data for the wild-type viruses reflect those observed previously, with PR8 exhibiting sensitivity to BST-2 while H6N1 replicated similarly in both MDCK and MDCK-BST-2 cells. With the chimeric viruses, the H6N1 PA was able to confer BST-2 resistance to PR8, while H6N1 (PR8 PA) was rendered sensitive to BST-2. All together, our data suggest that the PA segment carries the determinants for BST-2 resistance in our study system, with the avian H6N1 PA antagonizing BST-2 by down-regulating its expression at both mRNA and protein levels.",

Given the zoonotic nature of influenza viruses, we were interested in exploring this question from the perspective of human BST-2 acting as a cross-species transmission barrier for avian influenza viruses. We report here that, contrary to our initial hypothesis that low pathogenic avian influenza viruses incapable of transmission to human hosts would be strongly restricted by human BST-2, H4N6 and H6N1 viruses grew to robust titers in MDCK cells constitutively expressing BST-2 and appeared completely resistant to its antiviral activity. Mechanistically, our data suggest that this resistance is likely conferred by the drastic down-regulation of BST-2 levels by the avian PA segment through the reported ability of PA-X to mediate general host shut-off (Jagger et al., 2012) .",

            "text": "Before discussing the implications of our PA-associated findings, it is important to note that the H6N1 NS segment also exhibited the ability to decrease BST-2 protein levels. Unlike PR8, this H6N1 virus contains the F103 and M106 residues in its NS1 protein that are associated with host CPSF30 (30-kDa subunit of the cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor) interaction and NS1-mediated host-shut-off (Das et al., 2008) . CPSF30 interaction may not be directly related to BST-2 down-regulation or the sole contributor to this effect, however, as the H4N6 virus also carries this motif despite having an NS segment that did not decrease BST-2 protein levels. The H4N6 NS1 protein is divergent from H6N1 NS1 at five positions, carrying K20, I129, I137, A155, and S165 instead of R20, T129, N137, V155, and F165. Interestingly, three of these distinct H4N6 NS1 residues are shared with PR8, namely those at positions 129, 155, and 165. Residue 165, in particular, is located in the SH3 binding motif 1 that is involved in interaction with the PI3K (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase) p85\u03b2 subunit (Shin et al., 2007) . While we did not extensively examine the role of NS1 nor these residues in the down-regulation of BST-2, NS1 of A/WSN/33 (H1N1) and A/Texas/36/91 were previously reported to prevent the induction of BST-2 upon IFN-\u03b1 treatment (Mangeat et al., 2012) . This effect is not evident in most influenza virus-BST-2 studies which have focused on engineered cell lines constitutively expressing BST-2 (Bruce et al., 2012; Winkler et al., 2012) . Even so, our data revealed a strain-specific ability of NS1 to decrease BST-2 levels during infection in such a cell line, supporting the diversity of NS1 functionality in modulating the host innate immune response beyond its role in IFN suppression. The other products of the NS segment, NEP (nuclear export protein) and NS3 are unlikely to be associated with the observed impact of H6N1 NS on BST-2, however. The NS3 splicing motif, an A to G mutation at nucleotide position 374 (Selman et al., 2012) , is not present in any of the three viruses, while the NEP protein sequence is perfectly conserved between the H4N6 and H6N1 viruses.",

            "text": "Early on during this work, we hypothesized that PA-X, first described in 2012 by Jagger et al. (2012) as a frameshift product of the PA gene with endonuclease and host shut-off activity, might be responsible for BST-2 down-regulation as both protein and mRNA levels were affected. Indeed, in the transfection studies, the PA-X ORF appears to be strongly involved in mediating the decrease in BST-2 expression levels. This effect was likely due to endonuclease-mediated cleavage of RNA, preventing protein translation. Likewise, decreases in both BST-2 mRNA and protein were observed in infected cells. Suppression of BST-2 mRNA during infection that has previously been reported (Mangeat et al., 2012) could likely also be explained by the effect of the PA segment as well. However, the interpretation of PA and PA-X ORF involvement in BST-2 down-regulation changes slightly in the context of infection, as BST-2 is pre-expressed in the MDCK-BST-2 cell line. The ability of H4N6 and H6N1 infection to reduce both BST-2 mRNA and protein levels suggest that there is either post-translational down-regulation or extremely rapid turnover of BST-2, or both. If the former effect is indeed the case, it would be interesting to map out the mechanism by which PA-X may have exerted such a dramatic effect on protein stability. Nevertheless, our infection studies (Figs. 2 and 5) show a distinct difference between BST-2 mRNA and protein levels in PR8-infected cells, where mRNA levels are decreased but protein levels are not. This suggests that the endonuclease and protein down-regulation activities may be distinct. Alternatively, the impact of mRNA degradation may be amplified at a certain threshold due to high BST-2 turnover.",

These observations suggest that the PA-X ORF may be fundamentally different between the two viruses. It is possible that the H6N1 PA-X protein is expressed at very high levels from the wild-type PA gene, similar to that of the \u0394C mutant. This in turn implies that expression of the full-length PA protein itself may suffer as a result, due to higher rates of ribosomal frameshifting during translation. In other words, H6N1 and PR8 PA may differ in frameshifting rates as determined by factors outside the identified, highly-conserved frameshift motif. Alternatively, activity of their PA-X may be different despite neither having a truncated PA-X associated with changes in protein activity (Bavagnoli et al., 2015; Gao et al., 2015) .",

Intriguingly, we were able to successfully rescue one virus: the H4N6 FS mutant carrying the frameshift motif mutation in the PA gene, shown previously to decrease PA-X expression (Jagger et al., 2012) . That this mutation was able to render the recombinant H4N6 virus rescuable in cell culture suggests a role for the PA-X ORF in modulating viral growth. Indeed, PA-X has been described to suppress viral polymerase activity in certain contexts (Gong et al., 2017; Hu et al., 2015) , and its loss was accordingly associated with increased viral replication in both tissue culture and infected animals. It is tempting to speculate that this shifting of balance between polymerase activity and host shut-off may play some role in host tropism and cross-species transmission.",

While we did not specifically separate M1 and M2 expression in our study, the M segments of PR8, H4N6, and H6N1 as a whole did not confer BST-2 down-regulation. Similarly, Bruce et al. tested M2-deficient PR8 and found that loss of M2 did not notably affect alter its sensitivity to BST-2 (Bruce et al., 2012) . On the other hand, Hu et al. did not observe any impact of PA on BST-2 levels; this indicates that A/ WSN/33 PA may be similar to that of PR8, whose PA also lacks the activity seen with H4N6 and H6N1 viruses.

That such drastic impact was seen even with high levels of preexpressed protein that cannot be controlled pre-translationally by NS1 suggests that BST-2 does not necessarily act as a cross-species barrier for transmission of low pathogenic avian influenza viruses to humans. Furthermore, as these effects were surprisingly not observed to the same extent with tested human and human-derived viruses, we hypothesize that the avian PA segment may exhibit a different PA-PA-X balance that would translate into a disproportionately large impact on balancing host-shut off with viral replication compared to human viruses.",
