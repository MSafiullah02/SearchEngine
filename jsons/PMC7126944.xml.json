They are a vital component and safety net of the health care system and a frequent access point for those with serious illness (1). The ED has also become an important site for disease surveillance (2). Epidemics such as plague, pandemic influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome, and human immunodeficiency virus have all demonstrated the catastrophic international spread of emerging infectious diseases (3). With increasing globalization, epidemics are no longer isolated, but instead free to cross borders and oceans with alarming ease (4). A substantial proportion of the care for travelers and immigrants is delivered in the ED (5). Consequently, the ED shoulders an important burden of rapidly identifying and isolating patients with the potential to import epidemic emerging infectious diseases\u2014as was the case during the 2014 outbreak of Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) in West Africa (6).",

In one multicenter study in New York City, mystery patients with simulated measles and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome who presented to the ED during unannounced drills were significantly less likely to be given a mask and then isolated when travel screening questions were not asked at triage (10). Due to the low prevalence of EVD in the United States, it has not been possible to quantify the accuracy of screening. However, even a test with 100% sensitivity will fail the system if the test is not correctly applied to all comers. Unless the UTS protocol is applied to every patient, we may fail to identify individuals who import and transmit emerging infectious diseases such as EVD in our hospitals and communities. Our preliminary observations suggest that a number of patients each day do not have completed travel screening during triage despite the protocol and computerized reminders in the EMR.",

There may be other, equally important factors that influence adherence to UTS that were not assessed. The authors defined variables of interest a priori prior to creating the automated chart abstraction tool to minimize this effect. It is also possible that screening was truly performed, but not recorded in the EMR in some cases, which would falsely lower our adherence rate. Because other triage data were largely complete in the EMR, unrecorded responses are likely negligible.",

This could affect generalizability to hospital systems using alternative protocols. However, because our sites used the recommendations of the CDC's \u201cIdentify, Isolate, Inform\u201d guidelines that influence many other hospitals, it is reasonable to assume that these factors influence adherence across the country. Notably, there was variability even among our institutions in this study, with the hospital reporting the highest adherence also having the lowest annual ED volumes.",

A UTS protocol based on CDC recommendations during the 2014 West African EVD outbreak must be applied to all comers to the ED to identify and isolate possible imported cases of EVD. The UTS protocol is only effective with improved adherence to screening. We recommend protocol improvements directed at those patients that were least likely to be screened\u2014those that are acutely ill upon triage, that do not speak English, and that arrive via ambulance, helicopter, or other nonprivate transport.Article Summary\n1. Why is this topic important?Emergency departments (EDs) shoulder an important burden of identifying and isolating cases of emerging infectious disease that pose pandemic threats to our communities.\n2. What does this study attempt to show?We conducted a study to assess adherence to standard ED travel screening protocol and to identify factors associated with nonadherence to the protocol in an effort to improve the process for future pandemic threats.\n3. What are the key findings?Although the EDs included had an overall adherence rate of 93.7%, several high-risk populations were selectively missed by the screening at undesirable rates\u2014those with high-acuity triage scores, those that arrived by ambulance, and those that did not speak English.\n4. How is patient care impacted?Our findings can be used to improve travel screening protocols during future emerging infectious disease threats to avoid the unnecessary spread of disease to health care workers and our communities.\n\n",
