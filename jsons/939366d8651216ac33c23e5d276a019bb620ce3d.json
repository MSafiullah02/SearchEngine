A complete skin examination result was otherwise unremarkable, and dermoscopy showed normal proximal nail folds. A complete blood cell count; erythrocyte sedimentation rate; coagulation study results (prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, and thrombin time); a D-dimer test result; renal, hepatic, and thyroid function test results; an antinuclear antibody test; and an Epstein-Barr serology result were either within normal limits or negative. Urine was devoid of protein or blood. Finally A 4-mm punch biopsy was obtained from the edge of an ulcerated lesion on the dorsal third toe of the right foot. Histopathology showed a superficial and deep lichenoid, perivascular, and perieccrine infiltrate of lymphocytes, with occasional plasma cells. There was vacuolar alteration along the basal layer of the epidermis, with scattered singly necrotic (apoptotic) keratinocytes, which were occasionally present in the superficial layers of the epidermis (Fig  2) .

To our knowledge, it had not been previously reported because of the limited availability of PCR testing for COVID-19. Young patients presenting with chilblains have lacked criteria sufficient to allow for a COVID-19 PCR test. Because of the recent outbreak of chilblains, concurrent with the increase of COVID-19 cases, COVID-19 has been widely suspected as the etiology. We have further suspected an association because chilblains have been appearing during the warmer springtime rather than the usual cold winter period. Similar to this case, other young patients presenting with chilblains have also lacked a history of chilblains, Raynaud phenomenon, or collagen 111  112  113  114  115  116  117  118  119  120  121  122  123  124  125  126  127  128  129  130  131  132  133  134  135  136  137  138  139  140  141  142  143  144  145  146  147  148  149  150  151  152  153  154  155  156 vascular diseases such as lupus erythematosus.

Chilblains may be the inaugural symptom of COVID-19, and a fever and dry cough may be minimal or even absent. These patients appear to have an indolent course, often not knowing that they have a COVID-19 infection and that they are likely contagious. Acute acral cyanosis in the absence of chilblains has also been observed (unpublished data).",

Among these syndromes, the most representative are the overlap between Aicardi-Gouti eres syndrome and familial chilblain lupus and the stimulator of IFN geneassociated vasculopathy with onset in infancy. 5, 6 The aforementioned interferonopathies share both a clinical and biological overlap with lupus erythematosus.",

The IFN-I response, however, induces microangiopathic changes, producing a chilblain lupus erythematosuselike eruption. Older patients, unfortunately, may have an inadequate or delayed IFN-I response, exacerbating preexisting hypercytokinemia, with subsequent increased morbidity and mortality. Chilblain lupus erythematosuselike lesions in young people should not be confused with the acral ischemia caused by thrombosis that is being observed in severely ill COVID-19 patients. These patients, usually in the intensive care unit, have hypercoagulopathy and elevated D-dimer levels. 9 Thus, the IFN-I response in young patients may be advantageous, whereas the delayed or insufficient IFN-I response in older patients may be disadvantageous. In short, COVID-19 infectioneinduced chilblains may portend an indolent course and a good prognosis (Fig 4) .",
