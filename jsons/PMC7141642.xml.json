The risk of TdP is not a linear function of basal QTc or drug-induced prolongation in QTc interval. Moreover, not all patients with drug-induced QTc prolongation will develop TdP. This side effect is rare, but co-prescription of other drugs such as azithromycin (which is also being recommended for the treatment of COVID-19) could amplify this risk. Many other drugs such as quinolones, antihistamines etc. which are often used may also add to the risk of TdP (refer to https://www.crediblemeds.org/drugsearch for list of drugs associated with QT prolongation). HCQ also interacts with other cardiac drugs such as beta blockers and digoxin and increases the blood levels of these drugs.",

Accurate measurement also demands a specialist physician\u2019s expertise adding further burden on the strained resources. The alternative approaches in these settings could be the following.1.Standard telemetry systems which are also equipped with real time QTc monitoring is an option. This is especially true for sick, hospitalized COVID-19 patients who may be on continuous rhythm monitoring. The presence of associated dyselectrolytemia, which can further increase the risk of QTc prolongation in these sick patients, makes telemetry a good alternative to 12-lead ECG for this subset.2.Using a smartphone-enabled mobile QTc app or the FDA-approved mobile ECG devicesuch as AliveCor (Kardia Mobile-6L device), if available, obviates the need of personnel resources to obtain an ECG. The AliveCor was granted emergency approval by the US FDA on March 20, 2020 for this purpose and is currently available in India. If a smartphone or AliveCor app is used, the QTc could be recorded every 12 h.\n",
