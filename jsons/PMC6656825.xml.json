Based on genetic and antigenic variability, hMPV strains have been classified in two groups or lineages (A and B) and four sublineages (A1, A2, B1 and B2) [1\u20133]. The virus has been reported as a common respiratory pathogen in childhood, associated mainly with upper but also with lower respiratory tract infections [2, 4]. During the annual epidemics, hMPV has been associated with a significant number of hospital admissions in young children [4\u20137].",

Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was diagnosed as an acute diffuse lung injury with increased vascular permeability, bilateral radiographic opacities and hypoxemia not fully explained by cardiac failure or fluid overload following the Berlin criteria [21]. Exclusion criteria: subjects with nosocomial pneumonia or admitted due to non-respiratory infection (non-severe coincidental infection) and patients with pneumonia during the preceding 2 months (persistence of viral RNA in respiratory samples). Patients were recruited from the computerized records of the Microbiology department, and the medical records were revised by two clinical investigators (IT, LV). The recorded clinical variables were socio-demographic (age and sex), comorbidities, the Charlson comorbidity score and clinical symptoms at admission [22]. Radiological and analytic findings at admission and during the evolution, coinfections, antibiotic therapy, the presence of shock or need of mechanical ventilation, ICU and hospital stay were also recorded.",

Molecular characterization of hMPV revealed group dominance of subgroup B. HMPV infection presented seasonal distribution, with 2/3 of cases detected in late winter-early spring each year. The 32% of the studied patients were younger than 65 years without comorbidities. HMPV CAP often presented as acute respiratory failure with bilateral opacities and half of ICU subjects underwent mechanical ventilation. Lymphocytopenia and pleural effusion were common at admission. Plasma procalcitonin was a sensitive tool to identify coinfection with bacteria (25%), which contributes to antimicrobial stewardship.

In these episodes, procalcitonin has been reported to discriminate between viral episodes and those with bacterial coinfection [26], in contrast with CRP. Some studies have recommended different cutoff points of procalcitonin to discontinue early antibiotic therapy in patients with community-acquired therapy, being 0.25 ng/mL and, mainly 0.1 ng/mL the most recommended [27, 28]. None of the patients with documented bacterial coinfection in this study had a procalcitonin level lower than 1 ng/mL which supports the early discontinuation of antibiotic therapy in this group of patients with low plasma levels of procalcitonin.

The retrospective design of the study can underestimate the actual incidence of hMPV infection because some patients admitted because of acute respiratory infection could not be investigated for viral etiology. However, from the 2009 influenza pandemics, nasopharyngeal swab samples with respiratory viral detection are routine of care being collected in the 90% of patients with SCAP admitted to ICU.
