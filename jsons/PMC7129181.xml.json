            "text": "Every year, more than 10 million pilgrims from over 180 countries arrive at Makkah for the Hajj or Umrah. The number of pilgrims undertaking the Hajj has increased by a factor 5 from 1920 to 2012 [1]. One of the major public health concerns in relation to mass gatherings is the importation or exportation of infectious diseases, spread between attendees and the local population and further spread to home countries through the returning participants [2]. The crowding conditions within a confined area during the Hajj leads to high rates of upper and lower respiratory infections among the pilgrims, which represent a significant cause of morbidity and a major cause of hospitalization [3]. Recent studies conducted among French pilgrims showed rapid acquisition of respiratory viruses and bacteria carriage, particularly rhinovirus and Streptococcus pneumoniae\n[4], [5], [6], [7]. In the present report, we investigate the nasal carriage of a large panel of 34 respiratory pathogens among pilgrims arriving in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) from 13 countries on four continents and among pilgrims departing from KSA after participating in the Hajj. The aim of the study was to identify changes in colonization before and after the pilgrimage and to investigate circulation and potential for globalization of these pathogens using two distinct cohort survey designs based on previous works [4], [5], [6], [7], [8], [9].",

The selection of the country of residence was based on representative countries from each continent and the availability of nationalities during the sampling dates. Potential adult participants were asked to participate in the study on a voluntary basis. Three groups of pilgrims were investigated. One group was included in a paired cohort survey in which the same pilgrims were evaluated before and after participating in the Hajj. The two other groups were included in a nonpaired cohort survey: one group consisted of pilgrims recruited before the Hajj, and the other consisted of different pilgrims of the same nationalities recruited after the Hajj.",

The specimens were transported on dry ice to France for analysis. Each swab was processed manually. One milliliter of medium was pipetted automatically (Beckman NX automate) to prepare 96-well microplates for total (DNA + RNA) nucleic acid extraction and long-term storage. To avoid unnecessary testing, a dual aliquot was prepared from 100 \u03bcL of nasal swab origin. The total nucleic acids were then purified using the Macherey-Nagel Nucleospin-96 kit. The extract was then split for testing for the presence of viruses and bacteria.",

The first pattern was characterized by the introduction into KSA of pathogens isolated at low rates among pilgrims arriving specifically from one or two countries (Fig. 3\nand Supplementary Fig. S2). Some of these pathogens then spread to pilgrims from a large number of countries, with a slight increase in overall prevalence. This was particularly obvious for A/H1N1, which was found in two Indonesians only upon arrival but spread to 25 pilgrims from Africa, Central Asia and Southeast Asia after the Hajj. A survey conducted in a separate and larger paired cohort of French pilgrims at the same period also showed the acquisition of A/H1N1 after the Hajj, whereas the pilgrims sampled before leaving France were negative [7]. This indicates that the acquisition resulted not only from human-to-human transmission through close contact within each group of pilgrims from the same country but was also acquired from other pilgrims, given the extremely high crowding density to which individuals from many parts of the world are exposed when performing Hajj rituals. Contamination originating from an environmental source may also have played a role.",

These pathogens were isolated in 2% to 6% of the pilgrims arriving from almost all countries, with further amplification among the entire population of pilgrims after the Hajj in an epidemic mode, with acquisition rates of 11% to 34%. Some viruses such as HRV appeared to be spread among a very high proportion of pilgrims, as exemplified by the Bengali pilgrims, who were all negative at arrival but presented a prevalence of 50% after the Hajj. FLUA/H3N2, HCoVs, HEV and HRSV showed comparable patterns of transmission, but their geographical spread and/or prevalence were lower. Finally, a third pattern was observed, whereby pathogens were sporadically isolated among departing pilgrims but were never isolated among arriving ones (Fig. 5\nand Supplementary Fig. S2). This group included FLUB, HAdV, HPeV N. meningitidis and C. burnetii. This pattern may be explained by an overall low prevalence of pathogens among adults worldwide (FLUB) [17] or by a preferential circulation of pathogens in KSA (C. burnetii) [18].",
