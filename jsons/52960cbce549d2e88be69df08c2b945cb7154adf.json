            "text": "Clonally expanded CD8 + T lymphocytes are present in multiple sclerosis lesions, as well as in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with multiple sclerosis. In experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, CD8 + T lymphocytes are found in spinal cord and brainstem lesions. However, the exact phenotype of central nervous system-infiltrating CD8 + T lymphocytes and the mechanism by which these cells cross the blood-brain barrier remain largely unknown. Using cerebrospinal fluid from patients with multiple sclerosis, spinal cord from experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and coronavirus-induced encephalitis, we demonstrate that central nervous system-infiltrating CD8 + T lymphocytes are mostly of the effector memory phenotype (CD62L \u00c0 CCR7 \u00c0 granzymeB hi ). We further show that purified human effector memory CD8 + T lymphocytes transmigrate more readily across blood-brain barrier-endothelial cells than non-effector memory CD8 + T lymphocytes, and that blood-brain barrier endothelium promotes the selective recruitment of effector memory CD8 + T lymphocytes. Furthermore, we provide evidence for the recruitment of interferon--and interleukin-17-secreting CD8 + T lymphocytes by human and mouse blood-brain barrier endothelium. Finally, we show that in vitro migration of CD8 + T lymphocytes across blood-brain barrier-endothelial cells is dependent on a4 integrin, but independent of intercellular adhesion molecule-1/leucocyte function-associated antigen-1, activated leucocyte cell adhesion molecule/CD6 and the chemokine monocyte chemotactic protein-1/CCL2. We also demonstrate that in vivo neutralization of very late antigen-4 restricts central nervous system infiltration of CD8 + T lymphocytes in active immunization and adoptive transfer experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, and in coronavirus-induced encephalitis. Our study thus demonstrates an active role of the blood-brain barrier in the recruitment of effector memory CD8 + T lymphocytes to the CNS compartment and defines a4 integrin as a major contributor of CD8 + T lymphocyte entry into the brain.

            "text": "Multiple sclerosis is a CNS-directed inflammatory disease characterized by destruction of the myelin sheath, axonal loss and immune cell infiltration. Perivascular immune cell infiltrates found in active multiple sclerosis lesions are dominated by CD4 + T lymphocytes, antigen-presenting cells and CD8 + T lymphocytes (Sospedra and Martin, 2005; McFarland and Martin, 2007) . The pathogenic contribution of CD4 + T lymphocytes in multiple sclerosis has been extensively documented and is supported by the association between susceptibility to multiple sclerosis and major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-II genes (Ebers et al., 1996; Haines et al., 1996; Sawcer et al., 1996; Oksenberg and Hauser, 2005) , as well as by data demonstrating transfer of disease by myelin-reactive CD4 + T lymphocytes in the animal model of multiple sclerosis, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). In that regard, studies in EAE have shown a crucial role for both T H 1 and T H 17 CD4 + T lymphocytes in the initiation and progression of EAE (Becher et al., 2003; Langrish et al., 2005; Kebir et al., 2007; Kroenke et al., 2008; Stromnes et al., 2008) . Meanwhile, very little is known about the phenotype, the origin and the route of entry of CD8 + T lymphocytes found in multiple sclerosis or EAE lesions.",

In favour of the pathogenic contribution of CD8 + T lymphocytes, oligoclonally expanded CD8 + T cells were detected in demyelinated multiple sclerosis tissue (Babbe et al., 2000) , suggesting CNS antigen reactivity and CD8dependent lytic functions. CD8 + T cells have also been found closely associated with demyelinated axons in multiple sclerosis brain tissue (Neumann et al., 2002) and these cells were shown to interact with neural cells in an NKG2D-MICA-dependent manner (Saikali et al., 2007) . Recently, several groups have also developed models of CD8 + T lymphocyte-dependent EAE-like disease (Huseby et al., 2001; Sun et al., 2001; Cabarrocas et al., 2003; Zehntner et al., 2003; Saxena et al., 2008) , including those induced by transfer of myelin basic protein 79-87 -or myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) 35-55 -specific CD8 + T lymphocytes in C3H and in C57BL/6 or RAG1 \u00c0/\u00c0 animals, respectively (Huseby et al., 2001; Sun et al., 2001) . Moreover, Cabarrocas et al. (2003) were able to induce EAE-like disease by transferring haemagglutinin-specific CD8 + T lymphocytes into animals overexpressing haemagglutinin on oligodendrocytes, demonstrating the lytic capacity of CNS-infiltrating CD8 + T lymphocytes. Conversely, several reports indicate that CD8 + T lymphocytes could play a regulatory role and protect against disease development (Jiang et al., 1992 (Jiang et al., , 2001 (Jiang et al., , 2003 Koh et al., 1992; Friese and Fugger, 2005; Linker et al., 2005; York et al., 2010) . These include the findings that b-2 microglobulin-deficient mice exhibit a significantly more severe EAE than wild-type mice (Linker et al., 2005) . Moreover, Jiang et al. (2001) demonstrated that CD8 + T lymphocytes are able to dictate the phenotype of CD4 + T lymphocytes in the periphery of EAE mice by inducing more T H 2 cells. In addition, in a myelin basic protein-induced EAE model, CD8 + T lymphocytes downregulated pathogenic myelin basic protein-reactive CD4 + T lymphocyte clones (Jiang et al., 2003) . Also, CD8 + T lymphocytes have been shown to prevent disease relapses (Jiang et al., 1992; Koh et al., 1992) . Finally, the transfer of MOG 35-55 -specific CD8 + T lymphocytes in mice suppresses the induction of EAE and inhibits ongoing EAE by a cytotoxic/suppressor mechanism (York et al., 2010) . Therefore, the exact contribution of CD8 + T lymphocytes to the pathology of multiple sclerosis and EAE remains unresolved.",

            "text": "Under physiological conditions, a very limited number of peripheral blood immune cells cross the endothelial cells of the bloodbrain barrier (BBB) and the meningeal vessels, in a process called immune surveillance of the CNS (Sospedra and Martin, 2005) . During an inflammatory process, meningeal or BBB-endothelial cells amplify the migration of immune cells to the CNS parenchyma, in a multi-step process that involves selectins, chemokines (and their receptors) and cell adhesion molecules (Springer, 1994) . Leucocytes first undergo E-and P-selectin-mediated rolling along the surface of endothelial cells (Kubes and Ward, 2000) , followed by chemokine-mediated activation and firm adhesion to the endothelium (Engelhardt and Ransohoff, 2005) . BBB-endothelial cells and glial cells are an important source of the pro-inflammatory chemokines CCL2/MCP-1, RANTES and CXCL10/IP-10 (Ifergan et al., 2006) , which are required for T H 1 and T H 17 lymphocyte and monocyte recruitment to the CNS (Ransohoff et al., 2003; Engelhardt and Ransohoff, 2005; Mahad et al., 2006) . Lastly and most importantly, upon activation with pro-inflammatory cytokines, BBB-endothelial cells express cell adhesion molecules such as intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1 and activated leucocyte cell adhesion molecule (ALCAM), which mediate at least in part, the adhesion process and the transmigration of leucocytes to the CNS through their interaction with integrin Lb2 [leucocyte function-associated antigen (LFA)-1], 4b1 [very late antigen (VLA)-4] and CD6, respectively (Greenwood et al., 1995; Wong et al., 1999; Biernacki et al., 2001; Prat et al., 2002; Cayrol et al., 2008) . Despite the ongoing controversy on the role of CD8 + T lymphocytes in multiple sclerosis and EAE, the exact phenotype of CD8 + T lymphocytes found in the inflamed brain and the molecular mechanism used by these CD8 + T lymphocytes to access the target organ remain incompletely understood.",

We further show that early in EAE, CD8 + T lymphocytes infiltrating the CNS display more aggressive functions [granzyme B + interferon (IFN)-hi ] than CD4 + T lymphocytes and that IFN--and IL-17-secreting CD8 + T lymphocytes migrate faster across human and mouse BBB-endothelial cells, in vitro and in vivo, respectively. Finally, we show that the migration of CD8 + T lymphocytes across the BBB is mainly dependent on 4 integrin, in vitro and in vivo.",

Informed consent and ethics approval were given prior to surgery (ethics approval number BH 07.001). BBB-endothelial cells were isolated from non-epileptic material according to our published protocol Kebir et al., 2009; Cayrol et al., 2011) . In brief, meninges were removed and cortical and subcortical white matter material was minced (3 mm 3 ), resuspended in pH 7.2 phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and washed several times to remove blood. CNS material was then homogenized using five strokes of loose-fitting Dounce homogenizer at 40 g and filtered on a 350 mm pore size mesh (BSH Thompson). Filtrate was then passed twice through a 112 mm pore size mesh, collected and treated with collagenase type IV (2 mg/ml; Sigma) for 15 min at 37 C. After inactivation with foetal bovine serum (Sigma), filtrate was spun down and plated on 0.5% (v/v) gelatin-coated six-well plates in endothelial cell culture media composed of M199 cell culture media (Invitrogen) supplemented with 10% (v/v) foetal bovine serum, 20% (v/v) human normal serum, insulin-transferrin-selenium and endothelial cells growth supplement (5 mg/ml) (all from Sigma) at 37 C in 5% CO 2 atmosphere. Two days after initial plating, wells were washed twice with PBS to remove non-adherent cells, and fresh media was added. By days 5-7, colonies of endothelial cells were visible; by day 20, human brain endothelial cells from the microvessel fraction (5112 mm) could be expanded in tissue culture flasks. As previously demonstrated, these cells express factor VIII, von Willebrand factor, Ulex Agglutenens Europaensis-1 binding sites, endothelial antigen HT-7; and are susceptible to tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-induced ICAM-1 and VCAM-1 upregulation. Immunoreactivity for glial fibrillary acidic protein and -myosin was undetectable, confirming the absence of contaminating astrocytes and smooth muscle cells, respectively (Prat et al., 2000 Biernacki et al., 2001; Wosik et al., 2007) .",

We thus elected to compare the phenotype of CD8 + T lymphocytes present in the CSF to those in the peripheral blood of patients with multiple sclerosis. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells and CSF cells of untreated patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis were immunostained and analysed by flow cytometry. We noted an enrichment of effector memory CCR7 \u00c0 CD62L \u00c0 CD3 + CD8 + T lymphocytes in the CSF when compared with the peripheral blood of the same patients (Fig. 1A) . To establish whether these lymphocytes carry effector lytic molecule(s) typically ascribed to the CD8 effector memory phenotype, we evaluated their expression of granzyme B. We detected an increased number of granzyme B-expressing CD8 + T cells in the CSF when compared with the peripheral blood collected from the same patients (Fig. 1A) . We repeated the phenotypic analysis on cells obtained from 17 patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis and confirmed the significant increase of CD62L \u00c0 CCR7 \u00c0 granzyme B + effector memory CD8 + T lymphocytes in the CSF, relative to the peripheral blood ( Fig. 1B ; P 5 0.001).

To establish whether the enrichment of effector memory CD8 + T lymphocytes observed in the CSF of patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis reflects a preferential migration of peripheral blood effector memory subsets, or whether the effector memory phenotype is induced during the transmigration process, we used a well-established in vitro model of the BBB consisting of primary cultures of human CNS microvascular endothelial cells grown in the presence of astrocytic factors (Ifergan et al., 2006; Kebir et al., 2009) . Upon reaching confluence in the Boyden chamber, endothelial cells were stimulated with TNF and IFN-(both at 100 U/ ml), two cytokines reported to partake in multiple sclerosis pathogenesis (Sospedra and Martin, 2005) and known to activate endothelial cells (Calabresi et al., 2001; Biernacki et al., 2004) . After several washes to remove residual cytokines, ex vivo CD8 + T lymphocytes isolated from the peripheral blood of healthy donors were allowed to migrate for 24 h across human activated BBB-endothelial cells. Migrated and non-migrated CD8 + T lymphocytes were collected and their phenotype was analysed by flow cytometry. CD8 + T lymphocytes recovered from the lower chamber (migrated cells) were consistently enriched in CCR7 \u00c0 CD62L \u00c0 cells, as compared with ex vivo CD8 + T lymphocytes ( Fig. 2A and Supplementary Fig. 1 ). Consistent with these findings, we detected higher proportions of CD3 + CD8 + granzyme B + T lymphocytes and perforin + cells ( Fig. 2A and Supplementary Fig. 1) in the migrated population than in non-migrated and in ex vivo (peripheral blood) cells. We did not observe any difference in endothelial cell death whether endothelial cells were cultured in the presence or absence of CD8 + T cells (n = 4; Supplementary Fig. 2) , ruling out the possibility that the migration was the result of a damaged endothelial monolayer caused by exposure to cytotoxic CD8 + T lymphocytes.",

The migrated population (upper right panel) contained an enriched effector memory phenotype (CCR7 \u00c0 CD62L \u00c0 ) compared to the non-migrated (upper middle panel) and to the ex vivo (upper left panel) populations. Also, migrated cells were enriched in the cytolytic enzymes granzyme B (large boxes) and perforin (small boxes) (centre right panel) compared CD62L \u00c0 populations were sorted and allowed to migrate separately across BBB-endothelial cells. Interestingly, we found that CD8 + CD62L \u00c0 cells migrated more avidly across activated BBBendothelial cells than CD8 + CD62L + cells (Fig. 2B) . Similar results were obtained using non-activated BBB-endothelial cells (data not shown). Furthermore, only a very small percentage (52%) of CD62L + -sorted CD8 + T lymphocytes lost the surface expression marker CD62L upon migration across BBB-endothelial cells (Fig. 2C ). This confirms that the enrichment of effector memory CD8 + T lymphocytes following in vitro migration of CD8 + T lymphocytes results from their preferential recruitment across BBB-endothelial cells rather than induction of an effector phenotype from non-effector memory CD8 populations. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that activated human BBB-endothelial cells promote the recruitment of effector memory CD8 + T lymphocytes with an increased propensity to secrete granzyme B, perforin, IFN-and IL-17.",

Overall, we found a predominance of CD4 + over CD8 + T lymphocytes within the CD3 + lymphocyte population in the CNS of MOG 35-55induced EAE mice (Fig. 3A) . However, at the preclinical phase of EAE (day 8 post immunization, score 5 1.0) most CD8 + T lymphocytes found in the CNS were CCR7 \u00c0 CD62L \u00c0 (effector memory), while CD4 + T lymphocytes were CCR7 + CD62L + (non-effector memory) (Fig. 3A) . During the symptomatic phase of the disease, the proportion of effector memory CD4 + T lymphocytes increased significantly (day 12, EAE scores 1-2.5, Fig. 3A ) and by day 18 (EAE score 52.5) was equivalent to that of effector memory CD8 + T lymphocytes (Fig. 3A) . The production of cytokines and granzyme B by CD8 + T lymphocytes correlated with their effector memory phenotype. At day 8 post immunization, 94.8% of all CD8 + T lymphocytes in the CNS expressed granzyme B (Fig. 3B ) and 40.5% were IFN-+ (Fig. 3B ). At days 12 and 18, we observed a marked reduction in the proportion of granzyme B-and of IFN--expressing CD8 + T lymphocytes infiltrating the CNS of EAE mice (Fig. 3B) . Throughout the course of the disease, IL-17-expressing CD8 + T lymphocytes represented a negligible population of CNS infiltrating cells. These in vivo data corroborate our in vitro observations in human, suggesting a preferential recruitment of effector memory CD8 + T lymphocytes to the CNS compartment, in the early stage of autoimmune CNS inflammation. Moreover, these results support the notion that in EAE, specific populations of CCR7 \u00c0 CD62L \u00c0 effector memory CD8 + T lymphocytes access the CNS at least 10 days prior to the recruitment or the development of a significant population of CCR7 \u00c0 CD62L \u00c0 effector memory CD4 + T lymphocytes. FACS analysis of CNS homogenates does not allow us to identify the exact location (perivascular versus parenchymal white or grey matter) of these effector memory CD8 + T lymphocytes, within the CNS compartment.",

We focused the histological examination (Luxol fast blue and haematoxylin-eosin staining) on lesions characterized by perivascular infiltration within areas of demyelination, as previously shown (Kebir et al., 2007 (Kebir et al., , 2009 Cayrol et al., 2008; Ifergan et al., 2008) .

Triple immunofluorescent staining demonstrated coexpression of IFN-and granzyme B in CD8 + T lymphocytes within white matter infiltrates (Fig. 4A ) and in leptomeninges, with at least 20 AE 3 cells per lesion analysed.

CD3 + CD8 + lymphocytes were purified and restimulated in vitro in the presence of MOG 35-55 , IL-2 and IL-15 before transfer (Supplementary Fig.  4A and B) . While isotype control-treated animals developed a mild disease (average score of 0.70 AE 0.26, data not shown), anti-4-treated animals did not develop clinical signs of EAE (scores 0.1 AE 0.1, one out of six animals developed a score of 0.5). Furthermore, there was significantly less infiltration of both CD4 + and CD8 + T lymphocytes into the CNS compartment of mice treated with the anti-4 integrin antibody, when compared with those treated with the isotype monoclonal antibody at day 18 post transfer ( Fig. 5E ; P 5 0.01). The number of CD4 + T lymphocytes found in the CNS compartment were similar between the active immunization (46 500 AE 5500) and the CD8 adoptive transfer groups (44 860 AE 11 320), suggesting that activated MOG-reactive CD8 + lymphocytes from the donor animal can attract bystander naive CD4 + lymphocytes of the recipient animal into the CNS. Analysis of the CD8 + T lymphocyte population found in the CNS of recipient mice revealed a large portion of effector memory cells (62.1%; Supplementary Fig. 4C ) carrying the lytic enzyme granzyme B and the inflammatory cytokine IFN-(68.2 and 63.3%, respectively; Supplementary Fig. 4C ). These results put forward the important contribution of 4 integrin in the recruitment of CD8 + T lymphocytes into the inflamed CNS compartment and suggest that encephalitogenic CD8 + T Figure 4 Granzyme B and IFN-are highly expressed by CD8 + T lymphocytes in multiple sclerosis and EAE tissue.

(A) Human ex vivo CD8 + T lymphocytes isolated from the blood of healthy donors were allowed to migrate across activated human blood-brain barrier (BBB)-endothelial cells in a modified Boyden chamber for 24 h and then analysed by flow cytometry. The migration of CD8 + T lymphocytes was significantly reduced by anti-4 integrin blockade (clone 2B4), but not by neutralization of ICAM-1, VCAM-1, ALCAM, PECAM-1, MHC-I, IL-8, MCP-1 or L integrin (CD11a).

Results are expressed as mean AE SEM of 10 independent experiments, performed in triplicate on seven distinct BBB-endothelial cell preparations. ***P 5 0.001, treatment group compared to its corresponding isotype. (B) In vivo blockade of 4 integrin improves EAE clinical scores. EAE was induced by active immunization of C57BL/6 animals with MOG 35-55 /complete Freund's adjuvant. Anti-4 integrin (clone R1-2, open triangle) or isotype control antibody (IgG2b, filled circle) were injected intraperitoneally (75 mg) on days 6, 9, 12, 15 and 18 post-immunization (arrowheads). Results are expressed as mean AE SEM of at least 10 mice per group per day. Data shown are representative of two independent experiments performed on 22 mice per group (*P 5 0.05). (C) On days 8, 12 and 18 after induction of the EAE, the brain and spinal cord were homogenized and immune cells were isolated by Percoll gradient centrifugation. There were significantly less CD8 + (left bar graphs) and CD4 + T lymphocytes (right bar graphs) in the CNS of EAE CD8 + T lymphocytes in neuroinflammation a4 integrin blockade affects the recruitment of CD4 + and CD8 + T lymphocytes into the CNS compartment of coronavirus-infected mouse One of the essential roles of CD8 + T lymphocytes is to protect the host against viral infections. To evaluate whether anti-4 integrin blocking antibody could impact on the ability of CD8 + T lymphocytes to perform anti-viral surveillance of the CNS, we used a mouse model of CNS infection in which the MHV-A59 coronavirus is injected directly into the brain. CNS infection with MHV-A59 induces the migration into the brain of CD8 + T lymphocytes expressing VLA-4 and low levels of CD62L (Stohlman et al., 1998; Bergmann et al., 2006) . The peak of CNS immune cell infiltration is observed 7 days after infection, coinciding with the clearance of infectious virus (Gruslin et al., 2005; Hosking and Lane, 2009 ). As anticipated, and when compared with uninfected animals, CD8 + T lymphocytes were the predominant subset found in the CNS of MHV-A59-infected mice (97.8 \u00c2 10 3 CD8 + T cells versus 38.6 \u00c2 10 3 CD4 + T cells per brain; ratio of three CD8 + T lymphocytes for one CD4 + lymphocyte; Fig. 6A and D). Most infiltrating CD8 + T lymphocytes in the brain of MHV-A59-infected mice had an effector memory phenotype and expressed granzyme B ( Fig. 6B and C). Granzyme B expression was higher in infiltrating CD8 + T lymphocytes than in CD4 + T lymphocytes, while the expression of IFN-was comparable between the two T lymphocyte subsets (Fig. 6C) . These data are compatible with previously published articles on the importance of immune cell response for the clearance and survival of mice following an MHV infection and has been shown in several studies using RAG1 \u00c0/\u00c0 and SCID mice (Wang et al., 1990; Houtman and Fleming, 1996; Wu and Perlman, 1999) . To evaluate the role of 4 integrin in immune surveillance and defence against CNS viral infection, anti-4 integrin antibody or IgG2b isotype were injected intraperitoneally on day 4 after infection and animals were sacrificed at day 7. Anti-4 integrin antibody-treated mice had a worse clinical phenotype (moribund), when compared with animals that received isotype control antibody. We observed a significant reduction in CD4 + and CD8 + T lymphocyte infiltration in the CNS of mice treated with anti-4 integrin when compared with control animals (Fig. 6D , P 5 0.05 and 0.01, respectively). Again, to demonstrate the direct effect of anti-4 integrin antibody on CD8 + T lymphocyte recruitment to the CNS, we evaluated CD49d expression on CD3 + CD8 + cells found in the CNS of MHV-A59-infected mice 7 days after infection: 95.2% of infiltrating CD8 + T lymphocytes found in isotype-treated mice expressed CD49d (Supplementary Fig. 3A) . We also showed that there was no difference in the number of CD3 + CD8 + cells found in the spleen of isotype-treated mice and anti-4 integrin-treated mice 7 days post infection ( Supplementary  Fig. 3B) , demonstrating that the antibody treatment does not deplete CD8 + T lymphocytes in the periphery. These data confirm the critical role of 4 integrin in the recruitment of both T lymphocyte subsets during viral infection of the CNS compartment.",

We demonstrate herein a preferential migration of CCR7 \u00c0 CD62L \u00c0 effector memory CD8 + T lymphocytes to the CNS compartment, early in the course of EAE and MHV-A59 coronavirus infection. Our human data, using ex vivo CSF and peripheral blood samples of patients with multiple sclerosis and in situ immunostainings of multiple sclerosis lesions demonstrate that the majority of CD8 + T lymphocytes found in the CNS compartment of patients with multiple sclerosis (CSF and parenchyma) are CCR7 \u00c0 CD62L \u00c0 effector memory CD8 + T lymphocytes. In addition, data obtained from our in vitro model of the BBB, composed of primary cultures of human endothelial cells and astrocyte-conditioned media, show that CCR7 \u00c0 CD62L \u00c0 effector memory CD8 + T lymphocytes are better suited to migrate through BBB-endothelial cells. While our in vitro human BBB assay does not recapitulate the entire complexity of the neurovascular unit (including pericytes and the parenchymal basement membrane), data presented herein provide strong evidence that effector memory CD8 + T lymphocytes Figure 5 Continued mice treated with anti-4 integrin (grey bars) than in EAE mice treated with the control isotype IgG2b (black bars) at days 12 and 18. Results are expressed as mean AE SEM of two independent EAE experiments performed on 3-4 mice per time point (*P 5 0.05 and **P 5 0.01). (D) Frozen CNS specimens from EAE mice were stained for Luxol fast blue, haematoxylin and eosin or immunostains for CD8 (in green), CD4 (in red) and TOPRO-3 for nuclear staining (in blue). EAE brains from anti-4 integrin treated mice (lower panel) showed a reduction in immune cell infiltration, demyelination, and in number of infiltrating CD4 + and CD8 + T lymphocytes, as compared to the isotype IgG2b control group (upper panel). Photomicrographs shown are representative of 420 stainings performed on four animals. Dotted lines delineate areas of infiltration. Asterisk indicates a vessel. Scale bar = 10 mm. (E) In vivo blockade of 4 integrin in a CD8 + T lymphocyte transfer model reduces CD4 + and CD8 + T lymphocyte infiltration to the CNS compartment. Ten million MOG-reactivated CD8 + T lymphocytes were injected intraperitoneally into recipient mice. Anti-4 integrin or isotype control antibody (75 mg) was injected intraperitoneally, on days 1, 3, 5, 7 and 9 post transfer. There were significantly less CD8 + and CD4 + T lymphocytes (day 18 post transfer) in the CNS of mice treated with anti-4 integrin (grey bars) than in mice treated with the control isotype IgG2b (black bars).

(B) The profile of CD3 + CD8 + T lymphocytes was analysed by flow cytometry in infected mice. The proportion of effector memory (CCR7 \u00c0 CD62L \u00c0 ) CD8 + T lymphocytes was 73.9% (lower left panel). The proportion of CD8 + T lymphocytes expressing granzyme B (lower centre panel) and IFN-(lower right panel) were 80.2 and 41.6%, respectively.

The majority of CD8 + T lymphocytes collected from the CNS had an effector memory phenotype and expressed granzyme B. In comparison, 550% of CD4 + T lymphocytes had an effector memory phenotype. Expression levels of IFN-and IL-17 remained similar for both cell types, and IL-17 expression remained barely detectable in the CNS of MHV-A59 infected animals.

On day 7, animals were sacrificed and immune cells from the CNS were isolated.

However, our model does not fully recapitulate the two-step concept developed by Bechmann et al.

Moreover, we show that the migration of effector memory CD8 + T lymphocytes into the CNS precedes that of effector memory CD4 + T lymphocytes in EAE induced by active immunization and that the transfer of MOG-reactive CD8 + T lymphocytes into naive animals promotes the recruitment of bystander CD4 + T lymphocytes of the recipient animal into its own CNS. Finally, we demonstrate that MOG-reactive CD8 + T lymphocytes can induce a clinical form of mild EAE (average score of 0.70 AE 0.26), despite the recruitment of an equivalent number of CD4 + T lymphocytes. Our study therefore emphasizes the potential encephalitogenic activity of these CNS-infiltrating CD8 + T lymphocytes, as previously proposed (Saikali et al., 2007; Friese and Fugger, 2009 ), but does not provide the evidence that CD8 + T lymphocytes can induce EAE, in the absence of MOG-reactive CD4 + T lymphocytes.",

            "text": "Using three distinct animal models of neuroinflammation and a human in vitro transmigration assay, we also clearly demonstrate that blocking 4 integrin leads to a significant reduction in the migration of CD8 + T lymphocytes across CNS vascular structures. Surprisingly, CD8 + T lymphocyte migration was not affected by blocking interactions between L integrin-ICAM-1, ALCAM-CD6, PECAM-1-PECAM-1 or CCL2/MCP-1-CCR2. Since each of these molecules was previously shown to partake in the recruitment of various subsets of leucocytes to the CNS, including CD4 + T lymphocytes (L integrin, ALCAM, CCR2) (Greenwood et al., 1995; Prat et al., 2002; Cayrol et al., 2008) , monocytes/dendritic cells (L integrin, ALCAM, CCR2) (Seguin et al., 2003; Cayrol et al., 2008) , CD19 + B lymphocytes (L integrin, ALCAM, CCR2) (Alter et al., 2003; Cayrol et al., 2008) , eosinophils (L integrin) (Gonlugur and Efeoglu, 2004) , neutrophils (L integrin, PECAM-1) (Choi et al., 2009) and that none of them affect CD8 + T lymphocyte transmigration, we conclude that CD8 + T lymphocytes use different and more restricted molecular mechanisms to gain access to the CNS. It remains to be established whether, aside from 4 integrin, additional and possibly still unidentified adhesion molecule or chemokine pathways are involved in the trafficking of CD8 + lymphocytes to the CNS. Nevertheless, our results point to an important and significant effect of 4 integrin in the transendothelial recruitment of CD8 + T lymphocytes to the CNS in mice and in human, using an experimental in vitro BBB system. Our data also suggest that the considerable redundancy in molecular routes of migration observed for numerous leucocyte subsets (i.e. for CD4 + T lymphocytes and monocytes) might not apply to CD8 + T lymphocytes, and that the recruitment of these cells into target organs might depend on a more restricted array of adhesion molecules.",

Both heterodimers are expressed by lymphocytes in human and mouse, and are reported to be key mediators for the firm adhesion and migration of peripheral blood lymphocytes and antigen-presenting cells to CNS vascular structures, through interaction with VCAM-1 and/or the CS-1 specialized domain of matrix protein fibronectin (Berlin et al., 1995; von Andrian and Engelhardt, 2003; Luster et al., 2005) . In EAE, injection of mice with anti-4 integrin before the onset of symptoms prevents the development of the disease (Yednock et al., 1992; Theien et al., 2001) . In patients with multiple sclerosis, natalizumab treatment decreases the number of lymphocytes in the CSF and has shown beneficial effects on relapses, disability, T2 lesions and gadolinium-positive lesions (Tubridy et al., 1999; Miller et al., 2003; O'Connor et al., 2004; Stuve et al., 2006) . Unfortunately, anti-4 integrin therapy has been linked to an increase in the emergence of progressive multi-focal leucoencephalopathy, a devastating demyelinating disease of the CNS caused by reactivation of the human JC polyomavirus (Kleinschmidt-DeMasters and Tyler, 2005; Langer-Gould et al., 2005; Van et al., 2005) , and previously known to occur mainly in patients with HIV/AIDS, haematological malignancies or post-transplantation immunosupression (Berger, 2000) . The cellular immune response mediated by antigen-specific effector memory CD8 + T lymphocytes against JC virus was shown to be crucial in the control of progressive multi-focal leucoencephalopathy (Koralnik et al., 2002; Du Pasquier et al., 2003 Marzocchetti et al., 2009) . Although speculative, it is tempting to suggest that the effects of anti-4 integrin therapy on effector memory CD8 + T lymphocyte trafficking to the CNS, as observed in our study, could explain the emergence of progressive multi-focal leucoencephalopathy in patients treated with natalizumab. Given that the primary function of effector memory CD8 + T lymphocytes is to defend the organism against acute and persistent or latent viral infections, our data now provide evidence that immune surveillance of the CNS compartment by CD8 + T lymphocytes is significantly hampered by anti-4 integrin therapy.",

Given that this specific subset of CD8 + lymphocytes is known to be involved in immune surveillance of target organs and to control acute or persistent infections, we postulate that the emergence of progressive multi-focal leucoencephalopathy in natalizumab-treated patients arises from a deficit in CD8-mediated immunosurveillance of the CNS compartment. Immune cell transmigration across BBB-endothelial cells represents a critical step for initiation of CNS-directed immune reactions. Therefore, a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in the transmigration of specific leucocyte subsets is critically needed to develop therapies aiming to reduce organ-targeted inflammation, without affecting CD8-mediated immune surveillance. material to our multiple sclerosis specimen bank. We also would like to acknowledge the contribution of Dr. Jack P. Antel for providing us with human primary cultures of astrocytes. Additionally, we would like to thank Simone Terouz for her help in the preparation of multiple sclerosis tissue.",

(A) Flow cytometry profile of peripheral blood and CSF of one representative patient with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis reveals that CCR7 \u00c0 CD62L \u00c0 effector memory CD8 + T lymphocytes are enriched in the CSF (lower middle panel) compared to the peripheral blood (upper middle panel). Also, CD8 + T lymphocytes in the CSF express higher levels of granzyme B (lower right panel) than CD8 + T lymphocytes isolated from the blood (upper right panel) of the same patient. Data shown are representative of 17 independent experiments using 17 distinct multiple sclerosis donors. (B) Percentage of effector memory and granzyme B-expressing CD8 + T lymphocytes in the CSF and in the blood of 17 patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. The CSF (white bars) showed significantly more effector memory and granzyme B + CD8 + T lymphocytes compared to the peripheral blood (black bars). Results are expressed as the mean AE SEM of the 17 patients with multiple sclerosis (Increased migration of ex vivo effector memory CD8 + T lymphocytes across blood-brain barrier (BBB) endothelial cells.
