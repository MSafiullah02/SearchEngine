Subsequently, a novel coronavirus was isolated from patient groups in Wuhan and soon identified to be the causative pathogen of this highly contagious pneumonia [3,4]. In February 2020, the World Health Organization formally designated the disease COVID-19 (coronavirus disease 2019), and the novel coronavirus was designated severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). In two months, the outbreak of COVID-19 spread from Wuhan to all other districts of China. SARS-CoV-2 also caused many hospital transmissions and more than three thousand Chinese health workers were infected until March 15, 2020 [5]. On January 26, Wuhan city was locked down in an unprecedented manner with the majority of public transport cancelled. The WHO recently announced the current situation of COVID-19 as a global pandemic. Up to now there are no available specific curative medicines and vaccines, and the treatment methods for COVID-19 are largely supportive.",

The neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is a convenient index that can be calculated from a complete blood count, and many studies showed that NLR had a prognostic value in various conditions, including sepsis, cardiovascular diseases, and malignant tumors, etc. [[10], [11], [12], [13]]. Increased thrombogenicity and higher platelet aggregation had been proven in community acquired pneumonia, and a recent study reported that COVID-19 can induce a massive prothrombotic status [14,15]. D-dimer was also found to correlate with the prognosis of 2009 novel influenza A (H1N1) pneumonia [16]. Herein we performed a retrospective study of COVID-19 patients in the designated hospital in Suzhou China, and the correlation between hematological parameters and different severity groups of COVID-19 was analyzed.",

The early clinical studies mainly focused on COVID-19 cases in Wuhan, and part of patients included in studies were during their hospitalization [6,7,17]. It is essential to conclude the feature of COVID-19 early to fight against it. However, some limitations of these studies also exist. To explore features of COVID-19 patients with complete hospitalization and outside Hubei province, we enrolled adult COVID-19 patients discharged in Suzhou, one city in East China with an 11-million population.",

Besides severe lung lesions, the prominent derangement of the lymphohematopoietic system was noted. Decreased lymphocytes, cell degeneration, and necrosis were observed in spleen, and scarcity of lymphocytes and focal necrosis were observed in lymph nodes. CD4+ and CD8+ immunohistochemistry confirmed decreased T cells in the spleen and lymph nodes. Impaired myelopoiesis was also proved in the bone marrow. Another important study reported that SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid can be readily detected in blood stream of 10.5% COVID-19 patients, and there was a strong correlation of serum viral RNA load in blood with the disease severity [21]. The systematic inflammatory response, especially cytokine release syndrome which happened in some COVID-19 patients, usually involved various degrees of blood cell component abnormalities and coagulation factor activation. Huang et al. found an elevated level of NLR in community-acquired pneumonia which correlated with disease severity [22]. Serum D-dimer level was found to have a prognostic value in community-acquired pneumonia and 2009 novel influenza A(H1N1) [16,23].",

We compared the level of inflammatory factors and hematological parameters between two different groups of disease severity (Table 3), and six candidate indexes (CRP, PCT, lymphocyte, NLR, fibrinogen, and D-dimer) were chosen for ROC test. As seen in Fig. 2, the hematological parameters had a higher AUC than inflammatory factors (NLR 0.88, D-dimer 0.74, fibrinogen 0.74, lymphocyte 0.72 vs C-reactive protein 0.72, PCT 0.67). We then evaluated the diagnostic performance of four hematological parameters on different days after admission. The lymphocyte and fibrinogen levels can discriminate the two COVID-19 groups of different severity only on admission. In contrast, NLR and D-dimer levels showed superior performance not only on admission but also on subsequent different days after admission.",

Second, we did not test cytokines like interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) because of a shortage of biosafety labs. However, the benefit of routine cytokines monitor is still of controversy. We believed that ideal biomarkers for COVID-19 should be easily accessible, inexpensive and correct.
