Food insecurity existed, but now millions of children, home-bound with unemployed parents, cannot access nourishing foods; the number of hungry children alone could rise from 50% to 18 million (Feeding America 2020). Millions flock to food donations, waiting in line for hours for meager free boxes of canned goods. Food banks ration meager allotments. And this is just the beginning: unemployment skyrockets to 15%, though analysts estimate far higher total, once part-time, gig, and residual job losses get calculated. Vast unemployment numbers unfold rapidly around the world (Rothwell and Van Drie 2020).",

Again, lingering injustices\u2014farmworker exploitation, agrarian inviability, egregious monopolies\u2014are all laid bare, and sharpened. Amidst the painful contradictions of collapsing farms and surging demand for local foods emerges the logistical conundrums of vulnerable supply chains.

Long overlooked and obscured, they are designed to be invisible, with places, people, and labors unseen, unconsidered, and unvalued. The pandemic however lays them bare. The very materiality of farm and food labor conditions\u2014the cramped lodging and transport, the lack of drinking water or washing stations\u2014erupts from its prior invisibility into public glare. Major pork slaughterhouses have become deadly hotspots of contagion for those laboring inside them\u2014and their families and communities. Over a dozen major meat plants have closed in less than two months, upending the whole, highly concentrated meat supply chain nationally. The points of extreme exploitation, festering behind \u201cag-gag\u201d laws, become points of disproportionate exposure and viral-contraction for those with the least resources and healthcare access. Agricultural industries have long deployed the law to hide rather than expose abuses. The hypocrisy of migrant farmworkers\u2019 \u201cillegal\u201d yet \u201cessential\u201d status exemplifies this: ICE agents continuing to make arrests, even in areas hit hardest by pandemic (Alianza 2020). Amidst compounded risks and fears, migrant workers cannot seek medical, legal help or escape from work-related or domestic abuse or gender-based violence. Relatedly, detention centers have become notorious breeding grounds, like prisons, for contagion and fatal contraction. Agriculture has long been the overlooked push and pull factor for mass migrations: from agrarian crisis and rural depopulation from commodity crop dumping (Murphy and Hansen-Kuhn 2019) to global scrounging for low-wage, skilled (though deliberately not labeled as such) farm labor.",

Rural Coalition led a sign-on letter for Relief for America\u2019s Small Farmers Act immediate relief to small and historically disadvantaged farmers and ranchers who face financial devastation and land loss without assistance: forgiveness of all federal direct and guaranteed loan debt and suspend debt payments for the duration of the crisis. Food Chain Worker Alliance demands: emergency temporary standard by OSHA for infectious diseases; paid sick leave for farm, food, and fishery workers, with protective gear, training in appropriate language, hazard pay, optional overtime, and overtime pay; a moratorium on raids and deportations; and guaranteed right to organize for the 21.5 million food workers across the US agri-food system at large. National Family Farm Coalition, North Atlantic Marine Alliance, and others called on policy makers to: categorize regional food hubs, farmers markets, and seafood markets as essential services\u2014complete with supports such as emergency funding, comprehensive training for protection, and childcare; prohibit producer funds going to intermediaries such as packers, stockyards, processors, and integrators; vastly expand Local Agricultural Marketing Program (LAMP); invest in seashore infrastructure, docks, and cold storage for local, regional, and direct seafood supply chains; increase funding for Gus Schumacher Nutrition Incentive Program to double SNAP purchasing power at farmers markets; invest in Emergency Tribal Food Assistance Fund; expand online EBT purchasing for SNAP nationally; and end to the \u2018Public Charge Rule\u2019 restrictions\u2014with their classist, racist, and sexist underpinnings that immigrants (most of whom are laboring in agri-food) do not deserve food aid. Finally, in light of the billions in direct aid, farm justice alliances argue for supply management, systemic fair pricing legislation, and an updating of parity for diverse growers and food system resilience.",

Native American Food Sovereignty Alliance fights for tribal seed, food, and land autonomy and decolonization. The Cooperative Garden Commission circulates seeds for mutual agricultural aid.
