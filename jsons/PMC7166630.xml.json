Phylogenetically, Papillomaviruses (PVs) group into 49 genera, each further divided into species and types (http://pave.niaid.nih.gov/). The rapid evolution of the PCR\u2010based protocols and the high\u2010throughput sequencing technologies has led to a continual discovery of new species and types (Arroyo et al., \n2013; Bzhalava et al., \n2014; Bzhalava et al., \n2015; Brancaccio et al., \n2018). The Papillomavirus Episteme database (PaVE) (van Doorslaer et al., \n2017), established to provide organized and curated PV genomics information and tools, currently contains 330 reference genomes of human PV (HPV) and 183 reference genomes of animal PVs (https://pave.niaid.nih.gov/#home, accessed on 14 March 2019). The number of characterized animal PVs increases continuously (Mengual\u2010Chulia et al., \n2012; Rector and Van Ranst 2013) to the extent that recently, the proposal to create an International Reference Center for Animal PVs has raised (van Doorslaer and Dillner, 2019) in addition to the Referent Centre for the human viruses (http://www.hpvcenter.se).",

The first study on Swine PV was published in 2008 by Stevens and co\u2010workers, who used degenerate primers to amplify novel PVs from the healthy skin of domestic pigs in Belgium and reported the complete genomic sequence of two variants: SsPV1a and 1b (Stevens et al., \n2008). Eight years later, in 2016, a novel PV, named SsPV2, was isolated and sequenced from wild boar in Germany (Link et al., \n2017). It was the first swine PV associated with a skin fibropapilloma. However, phylogenetic analysis was not able to relate SsPV2 definitely with other PV species or existing genera; therefore, it was suggested as the potential representative of a new PV genus (Link et al., \n2017).",

            "text": "Papillomaviruses affect all domestic animals and many wild vertebrates. This study reports the first detection of swine PV in Italy, specifically SsPV1 variant a. SsPV1 is the prototype virus for the species Dyodeltapapillomavirus 1, the single representative of the genus Dyodeltapapillomavirus, detected from swab samples taken from the healthy skin of two female domestic pigs in Belgium (Stevens et al., \n2008). Little is known about the diseases that SsPV causes. A few studies documented fibropapillomatosis in piglets and transmissible genital papilloma in pigs (Rang and Dimigen 1971; Rieke 1980; Vitovec et al., \n1999). However, these were before molecular techniques made it possible to sequence the genome and therefore, the infectious agent could not be characterized precisely. More recently, Nishiyama et al. (2011) examined a cutaneous fibropapillomatosis on the head and the back skin of a 4\u2010month\u2010old piglet, but PV antigen and DNA were not detected in these lesions by immunohistochemistry and PCR, therefore the fibropapillomatosis was considered hamartomatous rather than infectious. However, the generic MY09/11 primers used in that study might have failed to detect swine PV. In the present study, a wide panel of broad\u2010range primers has been used, including MY09/11 and FAP primers, the latter previously proved to allow the amplification of different animal PVs (Antonsson and Hansson, 2002; Li et al., \n2013; Silva et al., \n2013). However, only specific primers for SsPV provided positive results. It is likely that esophytic or endophytic lesions such wart papillomas and venereal papillomas are more common than known in the swine population. Since animals with lesions are rapidly removed from the herds, the identification of PV is rarely performed. As consequence, the only available SsPV sequences in GeneBank and in PAVE database are the SsPV1 variants a and b (EF395818 and EF395819) found in healthy skin of domestic pigs (Stevens et al., \n2008), and the SsPv2 sequence (KY817993) found in a wild boar with esophytic papillomatosis (Link et al., \n2017).",

As for human PVs, their presence in pig slurry opens issues on their potential harmfulness for humans with particular reference to both occupational health risks for animal farmers (because of the direct contact they have with pigs and their wastes, e.g. during the periodical cleaning barns undergo) and the potential environmental pollution resulting from manure spreading on the soil. As a matter of fact, Ngabo et al. (2016) pointed out that, being farmer was among the secondary significant risk factors for HPV positivity (besides HIV\u2010positivity) in the population they studied, even though they do not relate this with the exposure to farm effluents (Ngabo et al., \n2016).",

However, acting on chemical manure properties may represent a potential improvement. Increasing manure pH, on the one hand, affects virus persistence (Hurst et al., \n1980; Stevens et al., \n2018) but, on the other, it causes ammonia emission from manures into atmosphere to increase (Petersen and Sommer, 2011) so that it cannot be considered among the best available techniques recommended for pig rearing (Giner Santonja et al., \n2017). Therefore, further investigation of HPV dynamics in manures could allow the set\u2010up of effective in\u2010farm manure management methods and practices aimed at improving the safety of exposed workers and lowering virus persistence in farm effluents and soils, in compliance with environmental and rearing regulations.",
