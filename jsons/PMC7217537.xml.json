To achieve this, numerous methods have been proposed in the last few years, consisting of random immunization [15], acquaintance strategies [7,16], targeted methods [3,4,17\u201319], etc. [20\u201323], ranging from the need of local information to the whole network demand. With respect to random immunization, the immunization nodes are randomly selected from a certain network\u2014without any priority about them. Similarly, random selection is also applied in the acquaintance strategy, but only one of the neighbors of a certain node is chosen to be immunized [7]. In addition, the targeted method is a widely accepted approach which first identifies the importance of each node and then removes the nodes in descending order of importance until the network reaches the immunized demand [3,4,18,19].",

Generally, high-degree nodes tend to connect to other high-degree nodes in assortatively mixed networks, while they mostly have low-degree neighbors in disassortative networks [24]. Moreover, a node with a low degree might play a critical role, whereas those with high degree might not be of significance comparatively (e.g., the betweenness centrality of nodes [25]). In the course of immunization, some subinfluential nodes would become influential after a few nodes are removed, while some others might lose their importance instead [heuristic immunized strategies [3,4,18], including the high adaptive degree centrality strategy, etc.]. All of such methods, e.g., the Collective Influence method (CI) [3] (better results always obtained with larger radius \u2113), show that a better immunization strategy could be discovered when more interrelationships of nodes are considered. This may be also a good interpretation why the high adaptive betweenness centrality strategy (HAB) is significantly effective in most situations, as well as the belief propagation-guided decimation (BPD) method [4,26] in artificial networks. But HAB has a limitation due to its high time complexity [O(n2m)] and BPD is not so effective in real-world networks because there are always many loops.",

In addition, taking Fig. 1(a) as an example, the removal of a node would affect the status (remove or not) of other nodes. These facts motivate us to use another approach: can the local optimization be effectively avoided by investigating the interrelationship among nodes?\n",

The main idea of the developed strategies is to explore and utilize the interrelationship among the nodes. In addition, RR combines the sum rule and the product rule from explosive percolation [29], while PR holds the assumption that nodes with high degree are usually more important than those with low degree. In this way, our approaches can achieve a better capability of avoiding of local optimum and obtain smaller thresholds than other methods. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategies, we conduct numerous simulations on a number of networks. The results show that our methods have significant advantages over other strategies, especially on large real-world networks where RR can collapse each of them into the same size of the giant component with less than 90% nodes of CI, BPD, or the Explosive Immunization method (EI) [19]. Moreover, our methods might also be used for the feedback vertex set (FVS) problem [26,30,31].",

Note that here RR is in the normal way (optimizing F) and PR is to optimize FVS (following the idea of BPD). As illustrated in Fig. 4, RR significantly outperforms CI of lower G(q) curves on both ER and SF networks. Considering the threshold qc on the ER networks, we respectively obtain qc=0.1767 by BPD, qc=0.1843 through EI (slightly larger, 0.0005, than the results in Ref. [19]) and qc=0.1809 with PR. Meanwhile, PR with qc=0.0977 is closer to BPD with qc=0.0965 compared to EI with qc=0.0996 in the SF networks. Besides, the results of qc versus the average degree \u2329k\u232a are exhibited in Fig. 5. Interestingly, when tied by K=6, EI performs worse and worse with the increase of \u2329k\u232a. The reason why this happens is ascribed to the fact that kvi(eff) (used to measure the spreading ability of a node [19]) is harder and harder to identify the nodes with similar degree as \u2329k\u232a rising,\n(15)kvi(eff)=kvi\u2212Lvi\u2212Mvi(kvj(eff)|vj\u2208\u0393(vi)),where \u0393(vi) consists of all vi's nearest neighbors, Lvi is the number of leaves (nodes with degree 1) in \u0393(vi) and Mvi({kvj(eff)|vj\u2208\u0393(vi)}) is the number of strong hubs (nodes with kvj(eff)\u2265K). In other words, more and more nodes have a degree larger than K when the network becomes dense. Hence, we also report the results of EI with K=\u2329k\u232a+2 (EI2) in Fig. 5 (but this adaptation is invalid for real-world networks). To summarize: considering the threshold, PR performs better than both CI and EI but slightly worse [(qcPR\u2212qcBPD)/qcPR<2.58% for all cases] than BPD in the model networks. In contrast to this, RR obtains a quite small F compared to other methods, e.g., (FCI\u2212FRR)/FCI\u22488.25% in Fig. 4(a) and 10.10% in Fig. 4(b), respectively.\n\n",

We still employ the paradigmatic ER and SF models to construct our basis networks. Then, for each network, the following strategies are used to enhance the clustering coefficients, i.e., increase the local loops. (i) Randomly choose one node vi and its two corresponding neighbors vj and vk subject to (vj,vk)=0, which means that there is no edge between vj and vk, namely, (vi,vj)=(vi,vk)=1 and vj\u2260vk. (ii) In the same way to respectively choose one of the neighbors of vj and vk, assuming they are vjj and vkk satisfying (vj,vjj)=(vk,vkk)=1, (vjj,vkk)=0, and vjj\u2260vkk. (iii) Cut (delete) the edges (vj,vjj) and (vk,vkk) and at the same time add two new edges (vj,vk)=(vjj,vkk)=1. (iv) repeat (i)-(iii) until the network reaches our demand, i.e., a given clustering coefficient. In this manner, the clustering coefficients of these networks can be improved and, apparently, the degree distribution of them is kept constant. As illustrated in Fig. 6, the fraction nFVS/n of PR rise more slowly than BPD with the increase of the clustering coefficients CC in both ER and SF networks, while the threshold qc of PR decreases more quickly than BPD. This may indicate that PR is more suitable than BPD for real-world networks. Therefore, we also show the performances of BPD, PR, and RR for the FVS problem in Table II where PR finds a smaller FVS than BPD in almost all the networks (16/17).\n",

For a given network under SIR simulation, its nodes belong to either the susceptible, infected, or recovered state. And before the start of the simulation, a part of nodes are previously identified and removed from the network based on a certain strategy. Then one random node is selected from the remaining network as the infected source and the others are to be susceptible. In each time step, the infected nodes infect their susceptible neighbors with the infection rate \u03bb, and then they recover with rate \u03b7. The recovered nodes are removed from the network too. This process is repeated until there is no infected node in the network. The simulation results are shown in Fig. 8 where \u03bb and \u03b7 are fixed to 0.2 and 0.05, respectively. On both networks, RR has a significantly lower value (9.5 to 20.0 times) of recovered individuals than EI under the same immunized fraction q [Figs. 8(a) and 8(b)]. Considering the final recovered fraction Rf [Figs. 8(c) and 8(d)], RR also outperforms CI and EI in almost all situations.\n",

To evaluate the effectiveness of both proposed methods, we conduct numerous simulations on two types of model networks as well as 17 real-world networks from different fields. The results, especially most of the empirical networks, clearly illustrate that our strategy considerably outperforms the existing well-known strategies, like CI [3] and EI [19]. In addition, our strategies might open up a new path to investigate more effective solutions to the robustness and immunization problems as well as obtain the minimal feedback set [4] in network science.",

(a) In this network almost all of the methods mentioned in this paper will remove v1 (marked with \u201c+\u2032') in the demand case of splitting this network into isolated ones, while the optimal removal set should be the nodes marked by \u201c\u00d7\u201d apparently. Now, assuming that v2 is removed first, then most of these methods will easily find the optimal solution in the remaining network. But the same situation cannot be induced by removing v3. In other words, the removal of v2 or v3 will influence the status of v1 (remove or not), and as a result it directly determines whether the optimal solution can be reached. (b) An example of RR under the sum rule and \u03c4=2. In this temporary network (\u03ba=16), we consider two assumed cases: (1) (v3,v4) then (v1,v5) and (2) (v2,v4), then (v1,v5), i.e., two rounds of selection. For the first choice between v3 and v4 in case 1, the occupied node is either v3 or v4 since \u03be(v3)=\u03be(v4)=5. After this, node v1 would be chosen because of 1=\u03be(v1)<\u03be(v5)=3 (might induce the optimal solution of qc). In contrast, v2 would be selected to be occupied at first [3=\u03be(v2)<\u03be(v4)=5], and then v5\n[4=\u03be(v1)>\u03be(v5)=3] in case 2 (might be associated with the optimization of F). In this example, we can also find how the status of a node influences the status of other nodes, e.g., v2 to v1 and v5. (c, d) An example of the PR method. In (c), some low-degree nodes are chosen and occupied first. (d) \u03be(v5)= 4/14 and here Cv5={c1,c2} marked by color shadow.",
