            "text": "There are several uncertainties as to how we will conduct these clinical, didactic, business and social activities as this COVID-19 global pandemic abates and social distancing guidelines are relaxed. We anticipate changes in the way we interact with our patients and other providers, the way we design patient workflow, the way we conduct our teaching sessions and, how we perform procedures in different clinical settings. The objective of this paper is to review some of the changes to consider in clinical and academic oral and maxillofacial surgery workflow to make this transition smoother, efficient, and less risky for our patients and health care personnel. New infection control policies should be strictly enforced and monitored in all clinical and non-clinical settings, with an overall goal to decrease the risk of exposure and transmission. Screening for Covid-19 symptoms, testing when indicated, and, establishing epidemiologic linkage, will be crucial to contain and prevent new COVID-19 cases until there is a vaccine or an alternate solution. Additionally, we will have to take into consideration the shortage of essential supplies such as drugs, personal protective equipment (PPE), the design and ventilation of workspaces and waiting areas, increase in overhead costs and possible absence of staff, if quarantine is necessary. This shift in our workflow and patient care paths is likely to continue in the short-term at least through 2021 or next 12-24 months. We have to prioritize surgery balancing patient preferences and healthcare personnel risks. We have an opportunity now to make changes and embrace telemedicine and other collaborative virtual platforms for teaching and clinical care. It is crucial that we maintain Covid-19 awareness, proper surveillance in our microenvironments, good clinical judgment and, ethical values to continue to deliver high quality economical and accessible patient care.",

The higher affinity (10-20 fold) of Spike protein of SARS CoV-2 for the human ACE2 receptor may explain the rapid human-to-human transmission when compared to that of SAR-CoV. [5] Implementing the required physical distancing measures to prevent transmission of the novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV2) has been disruptive to say the least, to our daily lives, patient care, business operations, and, to lesser extent to didactic activities. There is concern that relaxing the social distancing arrangements too early, as the pandemic abates could lead to a second wave of COVID-19 cases, extending suffering and socio-economic uncertainty over the long term. We cannot overlook the risk this may pose to our finite already overburdened healthcare personnel and hospitals that have reached capacity. While these consequences are possible, some time-sensitive patient care activities are necessary, to avoid worsening the prognosis of debilitating or life threatening disorders. [6] [7] [8] As we transition from our strict physical distancing guidelines to less stringent regulations to return to our clinical care activities there are several uncertainties. First, there are unknown and uncertain facts regarding COVID-19.1) exact case fatality rate due to the lack of an adequate denominator, 2) timing of infectiousness relative to onset of symptoms, 3) large number of presymptomatic or asymptomatic infectious patients, 4) duration of the infectious period, and 5) accuracy of commercially available rapid diagnostic tests to determine if patient has COVID-19. [9] Second, all surgical and non-surgical (endoscopic) procedures performed by oralmaxillofacial surgeons are high risk to health care personnel. Although, some of these uncertainties and challenges may be resolved as the data regarding the virus and the disease improves, we all have some apprehension and reservation to deliver care in this setting.",

(https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/priority-testingpatients.pdf ). For patients scheduled for in-patient surgery follow guidance for testing by each Institution/ State. As of March 24 , the CDC guidance for testing priority shows that oral and maxillofacial surgeons (Health care workers and first responders) would be considered as Mode of human-to-human transmission SARS-CoV2 is transmitted from one individual to another predominantly via respiratory droplets through direct or indirect routes. [3] Indirect transmission can occur through contact of inanimate objects (fomite) contaminated by the droplets. [17] Transmission through oral-fecal contamination has also been reported. [18] [19] [20] Droplet transmission occurs when respiratory droplets (>5 um in size) carrying the virus particles /pathogen, spread from the infected host to the susceptible mucosal surface of the recipient. Studies reveal that the respiratory viruses enter via nasal mucosa, conjunctiva and less often through the mouth. Droplets generated while talking, coughing, or sneezing are usually believed to travel up to a distance of one meter (3 feet) but can be farther than 1 meter.",

During this Pandemic, the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS), along with other professional medical societies and organizations, made a decision to halt all \"elective\" and \"non-essential\", \"non-emergent\" surgeries and preventive services. CMS suggested a tiered (Tier 1-2-3) approach based on acuity of treatment or service and conveyed that each organization or local institution should consider shared decision-making on case-bycase basis. Medical Ethicists, Caplan and Thomas, argued that the terms \"Non-essential\" and \"Elective\" are fraught with some confusion and emotion due to the vagueness of these terms, making it difficult to decide who would qualify for surgery. Instead, they suggest a framework that would answer 2 crucial decision-making questions: 1) whether the procedure is life-saving requiring immediate or urgent action, or 2) whether the procedure is non-life sustaining and does not take significant resources, but improves patient's quality-of-life. [45] Stahel has suggested that we implement algorithms that are clinically relevant and patient-safety driven to make surgical treatment decisions as shown in the figure. [46] He suggested stratification based on risk and resource utilization. Elective procedures can be divided into \"essential\" if an adverse outcome can occur due to delay in procedure for an undetermined period vs. \"nonessential\" surgery or \"discretionary\" if it is not time sensitive.",

The American College of Surgeons has recommended using this method or a similar method applicable to each institution; ultimately, surgeons have to be fair to patients, make the best clinical and most ethical decision for their patients. For OMS, among the several medically necessary conditions that we treat apart from emergencies, the most time-sensitive procedures include treatment for malignancy (ex. oral cancer, salivary gland malignancy, osteosarcoma), neurological injuries, aggressive benign jaw tumors, congenital craniofacial anomalies (ex. cleft palate repair before speech development), and chronic pain conditions that are recalcitrant to medical therapy.",

This is a high-risk AGP with higher utilization of resources due to possible postoperative ICU care or prolonged intubation in case of a complication and increased risk to the health care team, as well as the patient. Having a frank discussion with these patients to consider compliance with a non-surgical alternative therapy such as a CPAP with a different type of mask at least temporarily or, a hybrid method of CPAP with an oral device may pose less risk to all.

Let us consider the example of 65-year old male who presents for extraction of multiple (5-6) carious, nonrestorable teeth with periodontal infection with moderately well controlled HTN and, diabetes taking oral medications. The procedure is time sensitive with no alternative options and delay of 2-6 weeks' time can make the outcome moderately worse but the difficulty of the operation will not change. Based on the MeNTS scoring system if the length of procedure is short and it can be performed in an ambulatory setting, the score would add up to 31, which denotes favorable risk to personnel and resource utilization. Similarly, procedures such as placement of implants, dento-alveolar surgery, which are ambulatory procedures carry a higher risk to HCP and have lower resource utilization, possibly implying an overall favorable risk. Whether we modify and use this scoring method or an alternative, we will have to validate such scores for OMS procedures. In contrast, consider the options for a relatively healthy young female patient who requires Botox injection for intractable migraine headaches. The procedure is low-moderate risk, Outpatient OMS clinics particularly in hospital settings will require a new approach to maintain the patient volume.

Typically, drug shortages can be due to several causes. These The fact that 80% of raw materials in the pharma-industry come from outside the United States can be problematic. This is especially true if single source active product ingredients (API) or raw materials manufacturers face disruption to acquisition due to: 1) political instability/ government interference, 2) natural disasters/pandemics, and 3) contamination during drug production, storage or transport. Further, the distribution of drugs is affected directly by barriers to international transport of medications and inventory practices by healthcare facilities and supply chain entities. This affects smaller OMS practices because they have little or no inventory cushion to address short-term shortages. In addition, their inventory procurement capabilities are vastly different from those of large healthcare facilities and therefore cannot maintain an excess inventory. There also exists a large grey market that influences availability of different medications on a regular basis. Plan to monitor your current supplies and orders, estimate cost and need for anesthetic drugs, such as propofol, fentanyl, and oxygen. to an era of cloud-sharing platforms, virtual simulation, augmented reality and intelligence, chat bots, and robotic surgery, it may be feasible to collaborate and share knowledge and interact with others in the field without barriers.

These methods of audio and video-assisted teaching and learning will need proper evaluation with milestones for further validation to incorporate into the mainstream. Several undergraduate faculty across the country have developed problem-based learning tools and simulation models for clinical scenarios in oral surgery (ex. objective structured clinical evaluation -OSCE) to determine clinical competency of our dental students at all levels. Over the next few months as patient care resumes, we may have to rely more frequently on small group clinical teaching sessions (groups of 4 -5 students) and, problem based learning and simulation-based teaching models rather than direct patient care.",

UVGI is based on the principle of air cycling by convection between irradiated air in the upper zone (clean) and the patient care area or lower zone (dirty).

This allowed oral-maxillofacial surgeons to support our Institutions to handle COVID-19 patients while we handled maxillofacial injuries and head and neck infections among many other conditions, by a hybrid model using telemedicine and in-person evaluation. The emergency room can be a potentially high-risk area for COVID-19 transmission and other infections requiring use of significant personal protective equipment (PPE) for airborne flu-droplet precautions. We should consider teleconsultation services as an alternative to our current workflow to increase the efficiency as well as decrease risk of exposure to infection, especially given the inconvenience of performing procedures in areas of the hospital not dedicated for oral and maxillofacial surgical care.The potential incorporation of telemedicine OMS consultation services in the emergency room must include input from multiple entities including emergency physicians, trauma surgeons, other sister specialties (i.e. otolaryngology, plastic surgery), billing and compliance officers, and healthcare information technology teams. Designation of pathways of care for synchronous or asynchronous telemedicine consultation versus an in-person consultation must be discussed and determined with all contingents in agreement. OMS may also require additional availability in their outpatient practices to provide timely consultations and procedural care for emergency room patients discharged after telemedicine consultation. The financial impact of such remote digital healthcare services when managing patients without medical or dental insurance must also be considered. The alterations in this emergency room consultation delivery care model will initially require additional attending level expertise in training programs and increased communication with office management staff involved in scheduling.Patient evaluation in outpatient setting:We can continue to perform some of consultations for orthognathic surgery, obstructive sleep apnea, dento-alveolar surgery via telephone or video assisted visits and choose to have in-person interaction during the pre-operative and postoperative period to decrease exposure risk and improve efficiency of workflow. When preparing patients for orthognathic, trauma or temporomandibular joint surgeries, consider alterations to traditional practice by using a digital workflow. During a preoperative planning visit, all attempts should be made to avoid molded impressions and any intraoral imaging procedures that can lead to coughing/gagging and generation of aerosol or droplets posing a risk to the staff.",

Head and neck oncology patients pose the biggest challenge given the time sensitive nature of their condition, the age group, medical comorbidities and frailty of these patients, and high resource utilization as well as risk to HCP. Schuman et al. proposed an ethical framework for head and neck cancer care impacted by COVID-19. The authors highlight the conflicting interests of clinical ethics vs. public health ethics when considering population vs. individual interests. They suggest that considering metrics of tumor progression and risk of delay and, considering alternative therapies when applicable (ex. radiation) and feasible. In general, they suggest having a well thought-out plan through a collective decision making process with members of the tumor board, while taking into account patient preferences.[7] In such situations, looking at treatment models in limited resource settings with high volume cancer care such as the model described by Badwe et al. in the Tata Memorial Cancer Center where more than 70,000 new cancer patients, including a vast number with oral cancer are treated each year.[8] This disruption in surgical services for our cancer patients is also likely to stimulate further interest in considering immunotherapies that are more novel. This is a time to evaluate other existing technologies such as mobile telemedicine to diagnose cancer at an early stage by decreasing the time taken to refer patients to a specialist. Being aware of COVID-19 hotspots and understanding the population demographics as well as the risk factors of individuals susceptible to COVID-19 is critical to plan. Data from the CDC shows that the overall cumulative COVID-19 associated hospitalization rate is 29.2 per 100,000, with the highest rates in persons 65 years and older (95.5 per 100,000) and 50-64 years (47.2 per 100,000). Hypertension, obesity and diabetes were the most common underlying co-morbid conditions. (Figure 2. Comorbid risk factors in COVID-19 Patients) OMS in Inner city hospitals /out-patient clinics at academic Institutions often see high-risk populations who have limited access to oral health, who live in group homes, correctional facilities, nursing homes, or temporary shelters. These patients also often suffer from chronic diseases such as poorly controlled diabetes, hypertension, and renal failure other chronic conditions and immunosuppressive disorders. In addition, to limited access to health care these people have other socio-economic disadvantages, live in densely populated neighborhoods, have limited disposable income, have to visit stores for food and essential supplies frequently, increasing their risk of exposure and transmission of infection. Cases of COVID-19 are increasing in number among incarcerated individuals and workers in state prisons in Texas, Georgia,California, Massachusetts, Michigan, Connecticut, Pennsylvania, Washington.[48]",

Although massive open online courses (MOOCs) have been in existence for more than a decade, they have not been used as much, nor have they been evaluated for didactic surgical training.

We can extrapolate some aspects from experiences during natural disasters and such as Hurricane Katrina or similar events. During these uncertain times, the observed financial risk should not tempt us to restart our clinical operations earlier than the recommendations by our local and state authorities. It is imperative to follow their guidance, to avoid the risk exposure of our health care personnel and patients, as well as to preserve the necessary resources for our professional colleagues during this period of scarcity. This is a great opportunity to think about the way we practice and test new digital platforms to collaborate with other specialists. Consider requesting your accountant to calculate cash flow and expenses and provide a financial analysis and projection for the year ahead. Early conversations with your banker regarding a line of credit for the business, consolidation of loans with more favorable terms and changes to current loan covenants may be helpful. Many banks are open to loan forgiveness or interest only payments.
