Rapid growth of urban centers with poor urban planning and little capacity to meet the needs of a rapidly growing population often leads to the development of slums and shantytowns.

In the case of skin flora that can lead to serious infections, the exposure may be touch alone.

Several variables are basic to the mathematics of epidemics [3, 4]. Models for describing epidemics are based upon the reproductive rate of a given disease\u2014that is, the number of individuals infected directly by the primary case (the first infected person) during the time when she/he is infectious. The reproductive rate is itself determined by the attack rate of the disease (i.e., the risk of transmission in any given encounter), as well as the number of encounters the primary case would have, on average, during the infectious period of the disease. In other words, the greater the population density, the greater the number of encounters and the greater the reproductive rate. There are other factors that determine how a disease will be spread, including acquisition of immunity during an outbreak, existing immunity, the rate at which infected and susceptible individuals enter and leave the community, as well as the different types of encounter required for disease spread (i.e., via droplets, fecal-oral route, vectors, etc.). Population density is one of the most basic variables that affects the duration and impact of an epidemic.",

A significant proportion of the increase in urban population is due to the migration of people from rural areas to urban areas. As we will discuss in more detail further on this chapter, this can allow for the importation of diseases that were formerly confined to rural areas to urban centers where there may be increased opportunity to spread. This can also allow for increased opportunity to spread if, due to lack of prior exposure, migrants to a given area are more susceptible to a disease that is endemic to that area. In addition, as globalization continues and travel increases among the major cities both nationally and internationally, diseases can be propagated between and among urban centers. This can lead to farther-reaching\u2014even worldwide\u2014outbreaks of disease. Historically, travel by boat or train has enabled the transmission of endemic diseases to novel populations, causing outbreaks of diseases such as measles and smallpox and contributing to the decimation of native peoples. More recently, however, air travel has expedited the movement of airborne pathogens [5]. Viruses can now travel across the world within 24 hours, rather than within days. This statistic becomes even more powerful when considered together with the fact that more than one billion individuals worldwide travel by airplane each year [6, 7].",

Once a certain level of immunity against a given disease is achieved, either through the conferring of immunity to infected individuals who survive an exposure or through vaccination, the reproductive rate is necessarily reduced as the risk of transmission in a given encounter is decreased. Limits to the spread of disease and the propagation of an epidemic occur when enough individuals in a community are immune to the disease such that the likelihood of an infected individual encountering a susceptible individual is very low. This is the basis for the concept of \u201cherd immunity.\u201d The level of immunity required to prevent or interrupt a disease outbreak varies depending on the pathogen. Vaccination programs, which are discussed next, aim to reduce the percentage of individuals susceptible to a given disease and, ideally, achieve high enough rates of immunity to eradicate it.",

Inoculation, also called variolation, was likely also practiced in Africa, Turkey, and India long before the 1700s when the practice became more common in England and the rest of Europe and ultimately led to modern vaccination [9].

To maintain these successes moving forward, vaccination programs will have to be expanded to meet the needs of a growing population. Failure to do so will likely lead to resurgence of vaccine-preventable diseases, as in the recent urban outbreaks of yellow fever in several West African cities including Abidjan, Ivory Coast (2001 and 2008), Dakar, Senegal (2002), and Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso (2004). These outbreaks were likely catalyzed by lower vaccination rates in conjunction with increasing population density and overcrowding conditions favorable for the Aedes spp. mosquitoes that carry the virus [13]. Even in developed countries like the USA, vaccination remains an issue. Measles resurged in Southern California between 1988 and 1990, predominantly in urban young adults and children under 5 years of age who had not yet been vaccinated. Outbreaks occurred within schools, colleges, detention facilities, and other institutions in urban areas. In order to control these outbreaks, schools required immediate immunization of non-immunized children and many re-immunization programs were launched [14]. Finally, vaccination is not only a key to prevention of epidemics but is also a cornerstone of curtailing the spread of disease during epidemics and pandemics.",

Although most plague is transmitted in the bubonic form, evolution to pneumonic plague can lead to direct transmission from person to person. Early globalization, such as trade routes from China along the Silk Road into Europe and from seaport to seaport, allowed for the rapid propagation of plague, with up to thousands of people newly infected every day [18]. Recognition of the importance of the migration of traders and their wares into urban centers of trade and industry led to early attempts at outbreak control including quarantines, movement restriction, and closure of ports to ships coming from affected countries [18]. The risk of spread from rats to humans is now known to be related to the population density of rats, the level of flea infestation per rat, as well as the level of bacteria in both the rats and their fleas [19\u201321]. Although the epidemiology and ecology of ancient plague are certainly more complex than this, the importance of early urbanization in early plague pandemics is clear if not clearly understood.",

The duration of these interventions also had an effect; when cities relaxed these restrictions, the epidemic returned with a rebound in morbidity and mortality [24\u201326]. Another study used mathematical models to demonstrate that the number of infected individuals to which a healthy individual is exposed also may correlate with mortality\u2014that is, the greater the exposure, the more severe the illness and the higher the case fatality rate [27].

H5N1 Avian influenza is now epidemic among poultry and likely some migratory birds as well. When H5N1 is transmitted to humans, the route appears to be via direct contact with infected birds rather than via contact with other infected humans. This explains why the H5N1 virus did not become epidemic or pandemic among people.

There were only three influenza pandemics in the twentieth century, in 1918, 1957, and 1968. This is because in order for an influenza virus to cause a pandemic, three conditions must be met: first, the viral strain must be antigenically novel such that the population has little or no preexisting immunity; second, the strain must be transmitted to humans; and third, the strain must be efficiently transmitted from person to person [34, 35]. Once these conditions are met, particularly in the age of urbanization and globalization, worldwide spread occurs rapidly. As with SARS, all of the index cases in the early weeks of the H1N1 pandemic of 2009\u20132010 could be traced to air travel from the index city [36].",

Water treatment techniques include the use of bleach, chlorine, and filters and the boiling of water, among other simple, cheap methods [46]. In terms of water storage, a study of urban dwellers in South India found that the practice of storing water in brass containers significantly decreased the presence of E. coli compared to other types of storage containers [47]. Other scientists have argued for a holistic approach to addressing the water and sanitation needs of slums. A study in Ahmedabad, India, demonstrated that \u201cslum upgrading\u201d could significantly reduce incidents of waterborne illness. Slum upgrading was defined as creating \u201cconnections to a water supply for individual households, underground sewage for individual households, toilets for individual households, storm water drainage, stone paving of internal and approach roads, solid waste management, and street lighting\u201d [48].",

For example, the Plasmodium falciparum entomological inoculation rate, defined as the number of \u201cinfective bites per person per annum,\u201d [55] is considerably lower in sub-Saharan African urban areas than in rural ones [56]. There may be several reasons for this. First, unlike for Aedes spp. mosquitoes, urban areas are inhospitable environments for Anopheles mosquito development, the major vectors of the Plasmodium parasites that cause malaria [57]. City pollution is thought to inhibit larval development of Anopheles mosquitoes [58]. In addition, city dwellers have increased access to insecticide-treated nets (ITNs). Urban residents have a rate of ITN use three times higher than that of rural residents in sub-Saharan Africa. Finally, urban residents live in closer proximity to health-care facilities compared to their rural counterparts, affording them greater access to treatment for malaria once infected [54].",

This may be especially true among poorer sections of cities: urban malaria prevalence rates in Africa have been shown to be inversely correlated with individuals\u2019 socioeconomic status [61]. Furthermore, there is an emerging concern that many city residents lack sufficient immunity to malaria [58] and that urban children in endemic countries who regularly visit rural areas may be at increased risk for malarial anemia [62]. In cities where farming activities exist, so, too, does the potential for the urban environment to support anopheline mosquito development [58].

MDR-TB accounted for 440,000 cases worldwide in 2008 [63]. MDR-TB has been reported in many large cities, such as Mumbai, Sao Paulo, and Shanghai [13, 71, 73, 74] and in smaller numbers, XDR-TB cases have been documented in many cities around the world [75, 76]. New York City alone reported 19 cases of XDR-TB between 1993 and 2006 [77]. Data from Mumbai, India, found much higher rates of MDR-TB in Mumbai, compared to rural areas of India [78]. In China, there is concern that workers from rural areas infected with TB are migrating to the cities in search of work, consequently transmitting TB and possibly contributing to TB drug resistance [71, 79] There is concern that these Chinese migrants are neither seeking nor receiving appropriate, timely TB treatment [80]. The case fatality rate associated with MDR-TB is much higher than for nonresistant TB, especially if left untreated. Researchers studying TB in a poor section of Sao Paolo, Brazil, for example, reported a 60% mortality rate among the non-HIV-infected MDR-TB patients in the study sample [74].",

Urbanization may, however, influence behaviors that affect the risk of acquiring HIV, including alcohol and drug use as well as sexual behavior. Migrants to urban centers are often young people who are separated from their families and traditional social structures. In addition, the disparity between the rich and poor in urban environments can be stark. Migrants are typically seeking opportunity, coming to the city from a less privileged socioeconomic background. The confluence of these factors may lead to higher-risk behaviors.",

In China, where an estimated 140 million migrants reportedly exist, studies have described risky sexual practices and poor knowledge about HIV among male migrant workers [85], and even among migrant workers\u2019 school-aged children [86]. A study of male taxi drivers from rural Bangladesh who migrated for work to the capital, Dhaka, reported that approximately 60% of respondents had recently engaged in sex with commercial sex workers without using condoms [87]. Several studies of commercial sex workers in cities of India have documented the elevated risk of HIV infection among this population [88]. The phenomenon of young women and girls migrating to cities, becoming engaged in commercial sex work, and contracting HIV is well documented. A recent study of 287 Nepalese women and girls who had been sex-trafficked into urban brothels in India and then returned to Nepal revealed a 38% HIV-positive rate among these victims [89]. Seventeen of these women and girls were also found to have TB [90].

Tuberculosis infection tends to be both more severe and more difficult to treat among patients with HIV. Opportunistic infections, including infections with molds and fungus, may be influenced by movement between rural and urban environments. The high-risk sexual behaviors that lead to HIV transmission also place individuals at risk of acquiring other sexually transmitted infections, including syphilis. Additionally, because injection drug use has primarily been an urban health issue, urbanization may lead to an increase in injection drug use and thus further the spread of HIV. Injection drug use with shared needles can transmit many other viruses in addition to HIV. Approximately one in five injection drug users (approximately 16 million worldwide) is HIV-positive [94]. HIV also increases the risk of hepatitis C virus (HCV)\u2014almost a third of individuals with HIV are co-infected with HCV [95, 96].",

Anticipating continued growth and expansion should prompt governments to dedicate additional resources to urban planning. Vaccination, monitoring and reporting of new cases, and ring chemoprophylaxis are critical for curtailing epidemics and pandemics. Disease surveillance systems and systems for communication and reporting are crucial [98]. Rapid innovations in information technology may inform the development of such systems.",

First, there is a need to address the looming threat of bioterrorism, which capitalizes on the epidemiologic principles discussed in this chapter. Four diseases are recognized to have significant bioterrorism potential in urban settings. This chapter has discussed two disease agents\u2014plague and smallpox virus\u2014which can spread from person to person. The other two are anthrax (spores) and botulism (toxin), which are not spread from person to person but could cause mass infection and death if released in aerosolized form into a crowded area or, in the case of botulinum toxin, into the food supply. Outbreak preparedness requires identification of vaccines and treatments for these potential threats, developers who would be able to produce vaccines and treatments should need arise, and a sophisticated system of targeted, efficient diagnosis, isolation, treatment, and, where necessary, vaccination, to curtail further spread.",

MRSA is now found fairly widely in the community and may be more common in urban residents compared to rural residents [99]. Less common but of great concern is the emergence of vancomycin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (VRSA). Only a few cases of VRSA have been reported in the USA to date [100], but they highlight the importance of judicious use of antibiotics as well as adherence to contact precaution protocols for hospitalized patients with suspected or confirmed resistant bacterial colonization.",
