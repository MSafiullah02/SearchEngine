Previous studies suggest that prone positioning (PP) can increase the average ratio of arterial oxygen tension to the fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2) by + 35 mmHg and reduce mortality in moderate to severe ARDS, especially when combined with neuromuscular blocker (NMB) and low tidal volume ventilation, which decrease the risk of ventilator-induced lung injury (VILI) [1\u20135]. However, PP was only recommended in severe ARDS with PaO2/FiO2 < 100 mmHg, and the actual use of PP is less than 33% of severe ARDS patients [6].",

            "text": "From a theoretical and physiological point of view, NIV and HFNC may both be beneficial in patients with ARDS. However, these two techniques work via different mechanisms. NIV applies end-expiratory positive airway pressure (PEEP) and pressure support (PS). Optimally, PEEP increases functional residual capacity and opens collapsed alveoli, thereby improving ventilation\u2013perfusion matching and reducing intrapulmonary shunt, as well as improving lung compliance, thus reducing respiratory load. The latter assists respiratory muscles during inspiration, reducing work of breathing and dyspnea. In contrast, HFNC only generates a small positive pressure spike at end-expiration that depends on the nasal airflow and the extent of mouth opening. HFNC appears to improve oxygenation primarily by flushing the nasal airspaces, reducing anatomical dead space. In addition, by delivering warm, well-humidified gas through the nostrils and avoiding the discomfort generated by the pressure that NIV masks exert on the facial skin, HFNC is tolerated much better than NIV and can be applied continuously for long periods of time [17]. The major goal of NIV and HFNC in treating ARDS is to achieve a sufficient oxygenation to avoid endotracheal intubation. However, NIV and HFNC are only \u201cpartially support\u201d therapies. They do not address the underlying pathology of ARDS sufficiently, such as the ventilation\u2013perfusion matching caused by atelectasis or consolidation in the dependent areas when supported with HFNC [18]. High-level PS in combination with deep inspiratory efforts could generate high tidal volumes and excessive trans-pulmonary pressures, increasing lung stress and contributing to VILI, maybe a risk for NIV failure [19]. In this regard, combining PP with these non-invasive respiratory supports in ARDS may result in better physiological effects on ventilation\u2013perfusion mismatch, a better drainage for purulent lung infection-induced ARDS, and greater homogeneity in ARDS mechanics while receiving positive pressure support.",

High mortality warrants ongoing research efforts for alternative therapeutic strategies. PP during invasive mechanical ventilation for ARDS has been extensively studied and demonstrates decreased mortality and improved oxygenation and lung recruitment. As PP was recommended for patients with a threshold PaO2/FiO2 < 150 mmHg based on previous studies, we chose to test the effects of PP in non-intubated ARDS patients with a PaO2/FiO2 < 200 mmHg, which includes moderate and severe ARDS patients.",

Nine patients were intubated, including 2 (22%) patients of moderate ARDS and 7 (78%) patients of severe ARDS. Although no differences were statistically significant due to the small sample size of our study, moderate ARDS had a higher proportion in the successful group than in the failure group (73% vs 27%, P = 0.174). Moreover, SpO2 was significantly higher at inclusion point in the success group than in the failure group. Furthermore, although HFNC+PP or NIV+PP can improve the oxygenation compared to the HFNC or NIV single support in most severe ARDS patients, the intubation rate was very high and three patients needed ECMO for further support after intubation. Therefore, our results suggest that patients who meet the criteria for severe ARDS patients are not appropriate candidates for PP therapy. The late addition of PP to NIV in severe ARDS results in high risk for delayed intubation and treatment failure. Conversely, early application of PP in patients with moderate ARDS and an initial SpO2 > 95% on NIV may benefit and avoid the need for invasive ventilation.",

When a high level of positive pressure was applied by NIV in ARDS patients with spontaneous breathing, high driving pressure plus the high level of airway positive pressure delivered by NIV may lead to a greater possibility of VILI and poor outcome [13, 19]. HFNC provides a lower level of positive pressure than NIV and thus may be better in avoiding VILI in non-intubated ARDS patients with spontaneous breathing and a high TPP. Conversely, in our study, PaO2/FiO2 was higher with NIV than HFNC+PP in the success group. Our results suggest that for the patient with good cooperation with NIV, NIV results in a higher PaO2/FiO2 than HFNC+PP and may be the first choice for improving oxygenation. In patients who cannot tolerate NIV, HFNC+PP may be an effective alternative.",
