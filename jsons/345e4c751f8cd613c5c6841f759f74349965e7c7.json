The feedbacks suggested that there is adequate awareness of the COVID-19 pandemic among the people living in Lagos Metropolis, Nigeria and that they are following the directives of federal and state governments in an effort to reduce the community transmission of the infectious diseases.",

Others include aggressive campaign for good personal hygiene, regular hands washing with soap under running water, use of alcohol-based hand sanitizers and use of face masks. In addition, schools, companies and other public buildings were closed down to prevent community transmission of the disease. The President of Nigeria in a nationwide address on March 29, 2020 imposed a total lockdown in Ogun, Abuja and the country\"s commercial capital Lagos, for an initial period of two weeks so that the Federal Ministry of Health and Nigerian Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) and other stakeholders in the public health sector can make available the resources needed to control the spread of the disease. According to the President, the 14-day initial period of lockdown will also be used to identify, trace and isolate all individuals that had come in contact with confirmed cases, ensure the treatment of confirmed cases and prevent further spread to other states.",

Since it was impossible to administer interviews physically to participants, online interview approach which is also qualitative in nature, was employed to achieve the urgency that this study demands, during the COVID-19 pandemic that prompts lockdown and physical/social distancing. Ethical approval was obtained from the Faculty of Social Sciences Ethical Board, University of Ibadan. Hence, participation in the study was consensual, voluntary, and anonymous and the study poses no risk to the participants. However, this study used 50 randomly selected responses from the 96 respondents that filled the online interview, during the 14-days lockdown directive of the President of Nigeria. The data generated from the online interview went through careful transcription, detailed description and interpretation of emerging theme from the online interview. All categories of responses extracted online were compared and merged to draw out and/or create a clear picture of the emerging COVID-19 themes to further enhance the robustness of the findings and interpretations.",

The government should increase capacity to meet the yearnings of the people in providing more palliatives to tackle hunger and invest more in traditional list of immediate \"basic needs\" which in Nigeria are food (including water), shelter and electricity. This will further help maintain and guarantee the further compliance to COVID-19 prevention and control measures in Lagos metropolis, Nigeria that currently has the highest index case in the country. In addition, investing in basic needs, it will promote the obedience of civic order that is to curtail the widespread of COVID-19 in Lagos metropolis, Nigeria without accountability or reference to an external authority or use of force to compel obedience for residents.",
