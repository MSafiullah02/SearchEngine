            "text": "Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder resulting from inadequate secretion of insulin characterized by chronic hyperglycemia caused by high calorie diets rich in fat, carbohydrates and proteins (Kumar et al. 2017). The International Diabetes Foundation (IDF) reports that there were 425 million diagnosed cases of diabetes globally in 2017 which is estimated to increase to 629 million by 2045. Recently, there are more than 46 million diabetics in North America and the Caribbean, 58 million in Europe, 26 million in South and Central America, 39 million in Middle East and North Africa, 16 million in Africa and 82 million in South-East Asia. There are 352 million people at the risk of developing Type II diabetes (IDF Diabetes Atlas 2017). The emerging factors that contribute to the spread of Type II diabetes, comprising a progressively technological society, food habits with high calorie diets rich in fats and carbohydrates, and an increasingly inactive lifestyle (Wagman et al. 2017). Type II diabetes is associated with hypertension, dyslipidemia, obesity, cardiovascular disease, etc. It may also eventually cause tissue or vascular damage leading to severe diabetic complications such as retinopathy, neuropathy, and nephropathy (Keri et al. 2015). Out of several enzymes known, \u03b1-amylase and \u03b1-glucosidase are the key enzymes in the lowering of postprandial hyperglycemia observed in case of Type II diabetes mellitus (T2DM) (Patil et al. 2013). \u03b1-Amylase inhibits dietary starch from being absorbed into the body system and leads to lowering of blood glucose by the inhibition of salivary and pancreatic amylase (Ajiboye et al. 2016). \u03b1-Glucosidase inhibitors have been reported to reduce postprandial hyperglycemia in diabetic mellitus resulting in the lowering of glucose absorption by carbohydrate digestion and increases digestion time (Chaudhry et al. 2017).",

Chemical shifts (\u03b4) are reported in parts per million (ppm), and coupling constants (J) are expressed in Hertz (Hz). HRMS were obtained from Waters Synapt G2-Si QTOF and SCIEX 5600+ QTOF mass analyser by using the electrospray ionization (ESI) method. The purity of synthesized compounds was checked by precoated TLC plates (SIL G/UV254, ALUGRAM) using a mixture of hexane and ethyl acetate as eluent and visualization was achieved via UV light.",

Thereafter, the salt was dissolved in water upon warming and the product was precipitated by adding dil. NaOH solution. The solid thus formed was filtered through suction and recrystallized from ethanol to afford the corresponding amines in high yields (Mor et al. 2017). To a solution of hydrazine hydrochloride in ethylene glycol was added the appropriate benzo[d]thiazol-2-amine/6-substitutedbenzo[d]thiazol-2-amines in portions with continuous stirring and the resulting mixture was heated to reflux on a heating mantle for 2 h. A fine crystalline solid was separated out on cooling which was filtered, washed with water and crystallized from rectified sprit to yield the corresponding 2-hydrazinylbenzo[d]thiazole/2-hydrazinyl-6-substitutedbenzo[d]thiazoles (2) in good yields (Mor et al. 2017).",

A solution of the enzyme was obtained by adding 20 \u03bcL \u03b1-glucosidase (0.5 unit/mL) in 120 \u03bcL of 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 6.9). In microplate wells, the enzyme solution was mixed with 10 \u03bcL of each test samples which, in turn, were prepared by dissolving in dimethylsulphoxide (DMSO) at various concentrations i.e. 12.5, 25, 50, 100 \u03bcg/mL and incubated for 15 min at 37 \u00b0C. Thereafter, this was charged with 20 \u03bcL of substrate solution to 5 mM p-nitrophenyl-\u03b1-D-glucopyranoside in 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 6.9) and further incubated for 15 min. A solution of 0.2 M sodium carbonate (80 \u03bcL) was added to terminate the reaction, and absorbance was measured at \u03bb = 405 nm on ELISA microplate reader. The reaction system without test samples (4a\u2013o) was used as control while the system without \u03b1-glucosidase was used as a blank, and Acarbose was used as positive control.

Stock solutions of compounds 4a\u2013o were prepared by dissolving the compound (5 mg) in DMSO (5 mL) at room temperature. The \u03b1-amylase inhibitory activity was examined at different concentrations of each sample i.e., 12.5, 25, 50, and 100 \u03bcg/mL. The reagent solution without the test sample was used as the control and Acarbose was used as standard reference. Substrate solution was prepared by dissolving soluble starch (500 mg) in 0.4 M NaOH (25 mL) and heated for 5 min at 100 \u00b0C. After cooling in ice cold water, the pH of the solution was achieved to 7 by adding 2 M HCl, and water was added to make the volume to 100 mL. The sample (20 \u03bcL) and substrate (40 \u03bcL) solutions were mixed in a microplate well and the mixture in each case was preincubated at 37 \u00b0C for 3 min. Thereafter, 20 \u03bcL of \u03b1-amylase solution (50 \u03bcg/mL) was added to each well, and the microplate was incubated for 15 min. The reaction was terminated by adding 0.1 M HCl (80 \u03bcL). Then 1 mM iodine solution (200 \u03bcL) was added to the reaction mixture and absorbance was measured at \u03bb = 650 nm with ELISA microplate reader.

            "text": "In conclusion, the present study describe the synthesis and characterization of heterocyclic frameworks i.e., indeno[1,2-c]pyrazoles (4), and their biological evaluation as inhibitor of \u03b1-glucosidase and \u03b1-amylase related to Type II diabetes, and antimicrobial activity. The chemistry for the synthesis of indeno[1,2-c]pyrazole (4) involved the reaction of 2-acyl-(1H)-indene-1,3(2H)-diones (1) with 2-hydrazinylbenzo[d]thiazole/2-hydrazinyl-6-substitutedbenzo[d]thiazoles (2) in dry methanol to give benzothiazolyl hydrazones (3), which upon subsequent refluxing in glacial acetic acid afforded the target compounds 4 in good yields. Some of the synthesized compounds exhibited significant in vitro \u03b1-glucosidase and \u03b1-amylase inhibitory activity viz. 4e was found to be more potent with IC50 value 6.71 \u03bcg/mL against \u03b1-glucosidase enzyme and 4i showed good activity with IC50 value 11.90 \u03bcg/mL against \u03b1-amylase enzyme as compared with reference drug Acarbose (IC50 = 22.87 \u03bcg/mL). Moreover, some of the compounds exhibited convincing results for antimicrobial activity, however, with a degree of variation. The antidiabetic activity was found to be more prolific than antimicrobial activity. In vitro \u03b1-glucosidase and \u03b1-amylase inhibition was further supported by docking studies of compounds 4e, 4i, and 4o. Hopefully, these findings will prove helpful to medicinal chemists for the development of new inhibitors of enzymes related to Type II diabetes.",
