The whole polyclonal antibody repertoire in a retrospective cohort of 538 individuals was mapped against SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein, the main target of antibody immune responses in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Bioinformatic predictions identified 15 major B cell epitopes for S of SARS-CoV-2. Several epitopes localised in RBD of S including those spanning the ACE2binding site, the highly conserved cryptic epitope of the neutralizing antibody of SARS-CoV, and fusion/entry domains of HR1 and HR2 of S protein of SARS-CoV-2. Intriguingly, some of these epitopes have cross-reactivity to antigens of common pathogens, potentially affecting SARS-CoV-2 infection outcome. High level of anti-Spike SARS-CoV-2 seroreactivity in populations with no history of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 is of clinical relevance and could underpin better understanding of COVID-19 pathophysiology in different populations and provide a blueprint for design of effective vaccines and developing better strategies for antibody testing.",

A large proportion of people infected by SARS-CoV-2 can be asymptomatic 1 , whilst in those with symptoms, the disease can cause a spectrum of clinical manifestations from mild upper respiratory tract illness to cytokine storm and severe pneumonia leading to respiratory failure and death 2 . Older age and a number of co-morbidities (e.g. diabetes, cardiovascular diseases) [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] have been associated with the development of more severe disease however the underlying mechanisms of poor clinical outcome have remained elusive. Different patterns of immune response in COVID-19 patients are linked both to full recovery (e.g. emergence of antibody secreting cells and SARS-CoV-2 binding antibodies) and to poor clinical outcome (immune dysregulation and prolonged inflammation) 8 and death. However, the factors driving development of beneficiary versus harmful immune responses are unclear. One of the key features of the human immune system is its memory. First exposure to many of the common human viruses usually occurs during childhood or adolescence that shapes our immune memory and the immune response to self and environmental antigens throughout life 9,10 . The immune system's response to a new pathogen can be influenced by its memory of the response to a variant of that pathogen or a cross-reactive antigen. This is also known as 'original antigenic sin' (OAS) 11 , which could lead to either better protection against infection, or to a higher susceptibility and poor clinical outcome. This phenomenon .

Using simulated random alignment data, epitopes predicted by MVA were statistically significant (p<0.05) (Figure 1 ). Of these, 10 overlapped with the 29 CoV-2 reactive B cell epitopes 17 with average overlap of 60.1% per epitope, due to shorter length of MVA-predicted epitopes. Four of the epitopes (Epitopes 4, 5, 6, and 7, (Ep.4, Ep.5, Ep.6 , Ep7)) were mapped to the receptor binding domain (RBD), spanning amino acids 319 to 542 of S that is a crucial antigenic attachment region for binding with ACE2 18 (the main receptor for host cell infection) (Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure 2 ). In addition to positioning within the RBD, Ep.5 and Ep.6 overlap with the key amino acids important for binding to human ACE2 18 (Figure 1 ). Ep.4 and Ep.7 overlap with either the N-or C-terminal region, respectively, of the discontinuous epitope described for CR3022, a neutralizing antibody previously isolated from a convalescent SARS-CoV patient which can also bind the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 18 (Figure 1) . Interestingly, Ep.4 includes P384 residue, and Ep.7 contains H519 (mis valkude j\u00e4rjestuse j\u00e4rgi aminohappe pos on m\u00e4\u00e4ratud?) which are nonconserved between SARS-CoV and CoV-2 (Supplementary Fig 2) .

Sequence alignment histograms for potential antibody-specificity against S reveals prominent epitopes with alignment loads above the 95% percentile. 22,949 unique core motif sequences (of 1,380,000 distinct peptide sequences), representing top most abundant and shared immune response, were screened for sequence similarity with SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein (P0DTC2) by alignment analysis. The specific/random ratio is the alignment of motifs matching with \u22654 amino acid positions (specific) in proportion to shuffled-sequence motifs (random).

The identification of core motif sequences was either performed discriminatorily, where selected peptide sets were studied for enrichment compared to a control group, or non-discriminatorily, where enrichment was identified compared to a random-generated peptide set (hypothesis-free). In brief, for each clinical group, 100,000s of distinct peptide antigens were used as input, from which 1000s of distinct core epitope motifs were identified with SPEXS2 algorithm.

Alignment procedures were carried out using custom Excel VBA scripts and MS Office Excel.

The whole polyclonal antibody repertoire in a retrospective cohort of 538 individuals was mapped against SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein, the main target of antibody immune responses in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Bioinformatic predictions identified 15 major B cell epitopes for S of SARS-CoV-2. Several epitopes localised in RBD of S including those spanning the ACE2binding site, the highly conserved cryptic epitope of the neutralizing antibody of SARS-CoV, and fusion/entry domains of HR1 and HR2 of S protein of SARS-CoV-2. Intriguingly, some of these epitopes have cross-reactivity to antigens of common pathogens, potentially affecting SARS-CoV-2 infection outcome. High level of anti-Spike SARS-CoV-2 seroreactivity in populations with no history of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 is of clinical relevance and could underpin better understanding of COVID-19 pathophysiology in different populations and provide a blueprint for design of effective vaccines and developing better strategies for antibody testing.",

To predict immunogenic regions on S, in-house built custom algorithms were used for sequence alignment. Primary sequence of S was scanned with 22,949 distinct motifs with criterium of \u22654 exact-matching amino acid positions. Random reference profile was generated by scanning with shuffledsequence motifs (\u22654 exact positions). Random alignment distribution was simulated with 3 independent alignments with shuffled motifs. Specific alignments above 0.95 percentile of simulated distribution were statistically significant (p<0.05). Alignment profiles were visualized using custom Excel VBA scripts and MS Office Excel. Predicted B cell epitopes for the SARS-CoV-2 virus were published by Grifoni and colleagues 17 . Amino acids on Spike glycoprotein (S) of SARS-CoV-2 important for binding to human ACE2 were recently reported by different groups and anti-Spike RBD neutralizing antibody CR3022 discontinuous epitope were reported by Yuan and colleagues 18 .
