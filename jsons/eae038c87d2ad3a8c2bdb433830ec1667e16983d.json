While Almquist's work on idiopathic bacteria in chronic disease never received the plaudits accorded to Pasteur's work, Almquist foresaw the complexity that would later be inherent to the field of metagenomics -a field that today forces us to examine how countless microbial genomes interact with the human genome across disease states.",

As most major diseases of the time -tuberculosis, pneumonia, leprosy, and others -were linked to the presence of a handful of acute pathogens able to grow under these constraints, a \"game over\" attitude toward infectious agents dominated the thinking of much of the medical community. Little consideration was given to the possible role of these pathogens in autoimmune and inflammatory disease states. Instead, for most of the twentieth century, the predominant feeling about the treatment, control, and prevention of diseases with a possible infectious etiology was optimism (Cohen, 2000) . Between 1940 and 1960 , the development and successes of antibiotics and immunizations added to this optimism and, in 1969, Surgeon General William H. Stewart told the US Congress that it was time to \"close the book on infectious diseases\" (Avila et al., 2008) . With \"victory\" declared, increasing emphasis was directed at the \"noninfectious\" diseases such as cancer and heart disease. In many cases, research on infectious disease or activities on their prevention and control were de-emphasized and resources were reduced or eliminated. As recently as the 1980s, pharmaceutical companies, believing that there were already enough antibiotics, began reducing the development of new drugs or redirecting it away from antibiotics.",

In 1932, Razumov noted a large discrepancy between the viable plate count and total direct microscopic count of bacteria taken from aquatic habitats (Razumov, 1932) . He found higher numbers (by several orders of magnitude) by direct microscopic counting than by the plating procedure. In 1949, Winogradsky confirmed Razumov's assessment and noted that many microbes are not satisfied with laboratory cultivation conditions. He remarked that readily cultivated bacteria in natural microbial communities \"draw importance to themselves, whereas the other forms, being less docile, or even resistant, escape attention\" (Relman, 1998) . In 1985, Staley and Konopka pointed to Razumov's discrepancy and called it the \"Great Plate Count Anomaly\" (Grice et al., 2008) . Their review describes work in which they compared the efficacy of a fluorescent dye versus standard plating procedures in detecting bacterial species in samples of water collected from Lake Washington. They found that only approximately 0.1-1.0% of the total bacteria present in any given sample could be enumerated by the plating procedure -causing them to conclude that, unless new methods for detecting bacteria were employed, \"No breakthrough in determining species diversity seems likely in the near future.\"",

Over the course of a career spanning almost 50 years, Lida Mattman of Wayne State University cultured wall-less forms of bacteria from the blood samples of patients with over 20 inflammatory diagnoses including multiple sclerosis and sarcoidosis (Almenoff et al., 1996) . She authored an entire textbook on novel approaches for in vitro cultivation of bacteria (Mattman, 2000) . Over his 39-year career at Tulane University, Gerald Domingue published dozens of papers and book chapters devoted to the role of chronic forms of bacteria in inflammatory disease. \"It is unwise to dismiss the pathogenic capacities of any microbe in a patient with a mysterious disease,\" he wrote. \"Clearly, any patient with a history of recurrent infection and persistent disability is sending the signal that the phenomenon [infection with chronic bacteria or viruses] could be occurring. The so-called autoimmune diseases in which no organism can be identified by routine testing techniques are particularly suspect\" (Domingue and Woody, 1997 ).",

Other research teams using less rigorous techniques often failed to duplicate their findings. Many of their observations were dismissed on the premise that their samples could have been contaminated. However, the greatest impediment toward the acceptance of this work was a set of rules set in motion by the nineteenth-century German physician Robert Koch. These rules, known as \"Koch's postulates,\" stipulate that in order for a microbe to be deemed a causative agent of a disease, certain criteria must be met. The same microbe must be identified in every person with a given disease; the specific microbe must be able to be grown on pure culture medium in the lab; and, when reintroduced into a healthy animal or person, must produce the disease again.",

Neither Mycobacterium leprae, which is implicated in leprosy, nor Treponema pallidum, which causes syphilis, fulfill Koch's postulates, because these microbes cannot be grown in conventional culture media.

The 2004 International Congress on Autoimmunity in Budapest was themed \"Autoimmunity and Infection\" with many subsequent conferences and papers in the same vein. However, nearly all speakers discussed the role of viruses in autoimmune disease, whereas only a few contemplated bacteria. Autoimmune conditions were repeatedly attributed to easily cultured viruses such as Epstein-Barr and Herpes 6. Where bacteria were discussed, most reports centered on select pathogens such as Chlamydia pneumoniae. Yet because none of these pathogens has ever been detected in any one autoimmune disease state 100% of the time, such researchers continue to paint autoimmune diseases as a mosaic -in which the hallmarks of infection are continually present in bits and pieces but cannot be drawn into a fully cohesive picture. Yet the emerging science of metagenomics is beginning to unmask entirely new populations of microbes whose genomes allow for a means by which to bridge these gaps. The following chapter examines how this metagenomic microbiota can cause the dysfunction seen in a wide range of autoimmune conditions.",

Rather than focusing on the study of single microbes and their genomes, metagenomics provides a means of analyzing aspects of microbial communities through their underpinning genetics.

Polyomaviruses infect between 72 and 98% of humans, surviving in the kidney, lung, and skin (Virgin et al., 2009) . Similarly, human herpes viruses are extremely persistent. Anelioviruses, as well as adeno-associated virus, are now recognized to infect most humans by the end of childhood.

Some of these microbes, such as Bacteriodes, were found to penetrate the epithelial layer, at times intracellularly (Swidsinski et al., 2002) .

For example, analysis of the human oral cavity by Nasidze et al. identified 101 bacterial genera in the mouth as well as an additional 64 genera previously unknown to science (Nasidze et al., 2009 ). Yet, microbes have also been shown to persist in many other body tissues, including joints and blood vessels. Some of the same bacteria identified in the salivary microbiome, such as Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans and Porphyromonas gingivalis -both of which cause tooth decay (Lamell et al., 2000) have also been identified in atherosclerotic plaque (Kozarov et al., 2005) . Bacterial DNA has been detected in the blood (Nikkari et al., 2001) . Recently, 18 different bacterial taxa were detected in the amniotic fluid, which was previously believed to be completely sterile (DiGiulio et al., 2008) . Analysis using 16S rRNA sequencing detected 28 distinct phylotypes on biofilm removed from prosthetic hip joints during revision arthroplasties -joints also removed from a body compartment also thought to be sterile. The prevalence of hydrothermal vent eubacteria, which were previously thought to persist only in the depths of the ocean since they were found at temperatures well above 176 \u2022 F (80 \u2022 C), was higher than the prevalence of Staphylococcus aureus, a common biofilm species (Fig. 12.1) .",

Rather, the human genome is only one of myriad genomes that influence the Homo sapiens experience. Humans are controlled by a metagenome -a tremendous number of different genomes working in tandem.

Thus, the transgenomic interaction between an E. coli genome and the human genome, as they exchange nutrients and toxins, increases the complexity of transcription and translation for both species. The dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) antagonist trimethoprim is such an effective antibiotic because, like humans, bacterial species possess a folate metabolism. Bacteria in the distal intestinal tract of mice have been shown to significantly alter the composition of human blood metabolites, including amino acids, indole-3-propionic acid (IPA), and organic acids containing phenol groups, providing another example of the significant interplay between bacterial and human metabolism. A broad, drug-like phase II metabolic response of the host to metabolites generated by the gut microbiota was observed (Wikoff et al., 2009) , suggesting that the gut microbiome has a direct impact on the host's capacity for drug metabolism.",

For example, Goh et al. has shown that PTPN22 is related to rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, and diabetes mellitus (Goh et al., 2007) . Yet expression of PTPN22 is also modified by the bacterial metagenome -it has been shown to be upregulated as part of the innate immune response to mycobacteria (Lykouras et al., 2008) . The importance of understanding how microbes affect PTPN22 across multiple disease states has special impetus, given the increased rate of latent tuberculosis in the global population as well as studies showing high rates of infection by Mycobacterium avium among autoimmune patients (Bentley et al., 2008) .",

According to Bunge, the size of a gene pool for a given environmental sample can be estimated by mathematical modeling, but the size of the gene pool for a microbial biosphere, such as the human body, may be beyond any current credible model (Bunge, 2009) . While this complexity poses a significant challenge to systems biology and to Koch's simplistic one gene-one disease model, it does not impede the emergence of a better understanding of the human super-organism and the processes that cause disease.",

Metabolomic approaches can be used to characterize entire components of the microbiome that cannot easily be seen or studied directly. Because the downstream results of gene expression manifest in the human metabolome, the metabolome can be analyzed for the presence of those unique metabolites created under the influence of the microbiota. Dumas et al. used mass spectroscopy to identify the nonhuman metabolites present in the urine of subjects living in three distinct populations -the United States, China, and Japan (Dumas et al., 2006) . He found that subjects in each population produced very different nonhuman metabolites. Thus, genetic makeup, healthcare, nutrition, and external toxins, factors associated with the acquisition of a particular microbiota, caused the three populations to become significantly different. Moreover, when five of the Japanese subjects moved to the United States, their metabolomes changed to resemble those of the American population. This suggests that the metagenome is indeed the product of its environment, and that the composition of the microbiota is far more important than regional variations in the human genome itself.",

While just a few decades ago, most of the bacteria in Homo sapiens were assumed to persist on their own in a planktonic form, it is now understood that large components of the microbiota persist in communities commonly called biofilms; they are sheltered by a self-created polymeric matrix that better protects them from the immune response. Hundreds of different microbes can persist in a single biofilm community, and individual bacteria often form a niche inside the biofilm that allows them to promote their own survival and the chronic nature of the infection. For example, more virulent bacteria may protect the biofilm from outside intrusion whereas other less innocuous species inside the biofilm may focus on obtaining nutrients for the community. As the biofilm forms and then develops, the collective genetic expression of microbes in the biofilm is altered dramatically. For example, the expression of 800 genes has been shown to be altered when a single bacterial species joins a biofilm (Sauer et al., 2002) . Biofilms are increasingly being detected in autoimmune diseases where they were not known to previously exist. For example, Wolcott recently used pyrosequencing to demonstrate that the infectious agents that drive the development of diabetic leg, foot, and pressure ulcers are almost all in a biofilm state (Dowd et al., 2008) .",

Analysis revealed that the B. cereus mutant (B. cereus G9241) had acquired a plasmid with 99.6% sequence homology to pX01, B. anthracis' most virulent, toxin-encoding plasmid. Indeed, B cereus G9241 killed mice more quickly than B. anthracis.

Induction of such pathways leads to the upregulation of gene expression mediating pro-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic effector proteins. Thus, in order for pathogens (and potentially, symbionts) to continue their life cycle, it is necessary to evade or repress these cellular responses. This is especially true because acquisition of resistance to AMPs by a sensitive microbial strain is surprisingly improbable. Furthermore, the extension of human life during the past century now offers additional opportunity for microbes to evolve their specialization in order to survive in man.",

Indeed, EBV has been detected in a subset of patients with nearly every autoimmune diagnosis, although it has rarely been detected in 100% of patients with any given condition. In some cases, infection with the virus is described as a \"precipitating factor\" for (Yenamandra et al., 2009) autoimmune disease. That EBV downregulates VDR and ERB expression may explain this phenomenon. If a patient acquires EBV, the virus slows innate immune activity to the point where the endogenous microbiota can become dominant. This is particularly true because, in addition to reducing expression of cathelicidin and beta-defensin, VDR dysregulation opens a number of other pathways that also influence immune activity and hormonal regulation. Blockage of the VDR prevents transcription of CYP24A1, an enzyme that normally breaks down excess levels of the active vitamin D metabolite 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin-D (1,25-D). Activation of protein kinase A (PKA) by bacterial cytokines also causes increased production of the enzyme CYP27B1, resulting in increased conversion of 25-hydroxyvitamin-D (25-D) into 1,25-D. Both processes result in a rise in 1,25-D.",

Brahmachary et al. have shown that the glucocorticoid receptor, the androgen receptor, and the VDR are, respectively, in control of 20, 17, and 16 families The Thyroid-alpha nuclear receptor and T3, its native ligand [PDB:2H77], with the bound conformation of 1,25-D superimposed. Since the XSCORE Kd for 1,25-D is 8.4, and for T3 is 7.2, it is apparent that 1,25-D is capable of displacing T3 from binding to key receptor residues (shown here are Arg228, Asn179, Gly290, Leu292, Leu276, Ser277, Thr275, Ala263, Leu287, Ala180, Phe218, and Arg162) out of the 22 analyzed (Brahmachary et al., 2006) . Thus, dysregulating VDR activity yields flow-on effects that potentially disable the bulk of the body's AMPs. A patient affected in this manner would become increasingly immunocompromised, allowing disease-causing components of the microbiota to proliferate with even greater ease. This supports a disease model in which key components of the microbiota responsible for autoimmune conditions gradually shut down the innate immune response over a person's lifetime as bacteria, and other pathogens, incrementally accumulate into the microbiota. CD' is already characterized by diminishing functional antimicrobial activity, particularly when it comes to expression of cathelicidin and the beta-defensins (Nuding et al., 2007) . Eventually, genes from the accumulating microbial metagenome may instigate a clinical disease symptomology, such as one of the autoimmune diagnoses, or simply drive the inflammation associated with the aches and pains of aging. Indeed, the lifelong accumulation of an increasingly diverse microbiota directly correlates with an age-related increase in diseases and symptoms associated with inflammation. The term \"inflammaging\" has been coined to explain \"the now widely accepted phenomenon that aging is accompanied by a low-grade chronic, systemic up-regulation of the inflammatory response, and that the underlying inflammatory changes are common to most age-associated diseases\" (Giunta, 2006) .",

Traditionally, diseases have been understood to be discrete and have their own respective and distinct pathologies, hence the emphasis on diagnosis. However, if the spectrum of autoimmune disease were driven by a common factor -namely a person's microbial inhabitants -variability in disease could be explained by accounting for how the human microbiota accumulates and develops in any one person. Enck et al. recently analyzed fecal flora of stool samples from 35,292 adults whose ages ranged from 18 to 96 years of age in order to gauge the relative abundance and composition of various bacterial species over time (Enck et al., 2009) . He found that while the number of bacteria in the fecal microbiota remained stable with age, the composition of the microbiota diversified as subjects became older, with the oldest subjects measured (over 60 years of age) representing the most profound changes.

This process is known as successive infection and offers us a framework for understanding how not only diseases of the gastrointestinal tract develop, but also any number of other autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.

Merely shaking hands causes the transfer of numerous microbes (Fierer et al., 2008) . Genomic analysis of the bacteria on the hands of students leaving an exam room contained 332,000 genetically distinct bacteria belonging to 4,742 different species. Forty-five percent of the species detected were considered rare. This marked a 100-fold increase in the number of bacterial species detected over previous studies that had relied on purely culture-based methods to characterize the human hand microbiota.",

Although, as the team concludes, people may mimic the behavior of friends or family in ways that could cause them to gain or lose weight, it is also possible that the close proximity among many of the subjects in the study would have allowed them to directly exchange microbes. Since the composition of bacteria in the gut has, in several instances, been linked to the development of obesity (Kinross et al., 2008) -perhaps, in some cases, obesity is literally contagious.

The high rate of comorbidity among inflammatory diagnoses (Anderson and Horvath, 2004) lends support for this explanation.

Furthermore, the VDR expresses genes involved in both autoimmune and inflammatory processes. It transcribes insulin-like growth factor (IGFBP-3) (Wang et al., 2005) , which influences the development of diabetes, yet also expresses metastasis suppressor protein 1 (MTSS1), which plays a vital role in repressing the cell cycle and promoting apoptosis in cancerous cells (Wang et al., 2005) .

            "text": "If most autoimmune and inflammatory conditions do indeed arise from the same underlying disease process, then we must re-examine some of the cause and effect relationships postulated to exist among inflammatory conditions. For example, it is commonly believed that obesity is a causative factor in the development of diabetes (Hibbert-Jones et al., 2004) . In fact, patients with Type 2 diabetes are so likely to become morbidly obese that the two conditions are sometimes collectively referred to as \"diabesity\" (Bailey, 2009 ). Obesity has been tied to microbial composition in the gut (Turnbaugh et al., 2006) , the result of a microbial process. Roesch et al. found that the onset of Type 1 diabetes was tied to the presence of specific bacteria in the murine gut (Roesch et al., 2009) . Additionally, at least one microbial species, Streptomyces achromogenes, secretes a substance, streptozocin, which can directly induce Type 1 diabetes (Bolzan and Bianchi, 2002) . The diabetes disease process would also make it substantially harder for the immune system to regulate microbial gut composition. In particular, species that are extremely effective at extracting calories from food may thrive while their innocuous counterparts may find themselves out-competed. The expression of hormones that regulate appetite, such as leptin or ghrelin, could also become dysregulated by the bacterial microbiota (Fetissov et al., 2008) . For example, H. pylori infection leads to a decrease in circulating ghrelin through a reduction in ghrelin-producing cells in the gastric mucosa (Weigt and Malfertheiner, 2009 ). In some cases, this could cause weight gain even in the absence of excess calorie consumption (English et al., 2002) . In light of the above, obesity and diabetes might better be described as developing simultaneously. Treatments aimed at addressing those underlying factors contributing to both disease states might well prove the most effective.",

If, as in humans, the murine metagenome causes disease as it accumulates over time, then the interactions between various microbial species may be telling. Even within the context of the ultimate example of symbiotic behavior, the biofilm, bacteria have been shown to compete with one another, sometimes even \"cheating\" to do so (Dunny et al., 2008) .

Besides, in cases of P. aeruginosa and S. aureus co-infection in the presence of HQNO, smallcolony variants of S. aureus are selected for, making S. aureus more difficult for the immune system to target.

In the case of schizophrenia and autism, both have been associated with prenatal viral infection (Fatemi et al., 2008) . While a fetus can acquire these and many other pathogens directly, successive infection dictates that as children age they will manifest with inflammatory symptoms that may differ from those of their parents. Major factors that would influence the development of a discrete inflammatory diagnosis include the mix of species acquired, the sequence in which the pathogens are acquired, the subsequent changes in gene expression caused by the pathogens, and the profound effect on the body's proteins, enzymes, and metabolites caused by these changes. Because the adaptive immune response in infants takes several weeks to develop, infants are particularly prone to picking up pathogens during the first weeks of life (Bisgaard et al., 2007) . Such pathogens could be acquired from any family or friends in contact with the child, especially the grandparents, who probably harbor some of the highest pathogenic loads. Palmer et al. found that infants pick up many of the species that make up their gut flora from family members within just a few weeks of birth, suggesting that nongut bacteria may easily be acquired during this time as well (Palmer et al., 2007) .",

Its primary goal was to determine the sequence of chemical base pairs that make up DNA and to identify the genes of the human genome from both a physical and a functional standpoint. A working draft of the genome was released in 2000 and a complete version in 2003, with further analyses yet to be completed and published (Collins et al., 2003) .

Dr. Francis Collins' 2001 statement was typical: \"It should be possible to identify disease gene associations for many common illnesses in the next -7 years\" (Collins and McKusick, 2001) . Researchers hoped that by dissecting the human genome, patients could be informed that they had \"the gene\" for breast cancer, sarcoidosis, rheumatoid arthritis, or any of the other autoimmune diagnoses. Targeted gene therapies could then be developed to effectively eradicate these conditions. It may be too early to call human genomic research an unqualified failure (Buchanan et al., 2006) , but it is difficult to ignore a lack of utility in identification of disease. Recently, the limited progress in the genetic analysis of common diseases has begun to be acknowledged (Davey Smith et al., 2005; Risch, 2000) . Certainly there have been no widely successful gene therapies to date, and genomedriven personalized medicine has yet to live up to its early promise. To identify what some researchers refer to as the \"missing heritability,\" geneticists have proposed GWA studies with historically unprecedented sample sizes. In the past year, researchers have publicly contemplated \"daunting\" sample sizes exceeding 500,000 subjects in concert with studies that would be conducted over periods as long as 45 years (Burton et al., 2009) .",

An exception would occur if the disease offers a survival advantage. For example, the genetic disorder cystic fibrosis may confer resistance to tuberculosis (Poolman and Galvani, 2007) . The Mendelian disorder sickle cell anemia is common in tropical countries because it confers resistance to malaria. With malaria, researchers can quantify the rate by generation at which the gene for sickle cell anemia is dropped from the population in the absence of an evolutionary advantageas is the case when people migrate away from malaria-infested areas. However, no autoimmune diagnosis has been shown to confer any sort of beneficial survival trait. Under these circumstances, one would expect any faulty gene or network of genes associated with an autoimmune condition to be selected against, especially since many autoimmune conditions strike during the reproductive years. Chronic diseases have existed for thousands of years with manifestations of both arteriosclerosis (Azer, 1999) and cardiac disease observed in mummies of ancient Egypt (Miller et al., 2000) . \u00d6tzi the Neolithic Iceman who lived around 3300 BC had arthritis, allowing ample time for any alleles associated with autoimmune disease to be eliminated via natural selection (Dickson et al., 2003) .

Similarly, anti-EBNA-1 antibodies are able to bind lupus-specific autoantigens such as Sm or Ro (Harley and James, 2006) . Casali and Slaughter found that, in humans, EBV is a polyclonal B cell activator, and in vitro transformation with EBV results in production of rheumatoid factor (RF) (Casali et al., 1987; Slaughter et al., 1978) . Possnett et al. argues that high titers of RF are not only associated with severe rheumatoid arthritis but also appear in a number of other diseases including viral, bacterial, and parasitic infections (Posnett and Edinger, 1997) . Maturation of RF can be initiated by chronic infections (Djavad et al., 1996) . For example, patients with subacute bacterial endocarditis, which is frequently tied to the presence of Streptococcus, also often present with high levels of RF (Russell et al., 1992) . Williams et al. showed that once the offending infectious agent is removed with antibiotic therapy, the RF disappears (Williams and Kunkel, 1962) . Similarly, the autoimmune disease thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is mediated by what are considered to be anti-platelet autoantibodies. However, Asahi et al. found that eradication of H. pylori is effective in increasing platelet count in nearly half of ITP patients infected with the bacterium (Asahi et al., 2006) . Barzilai and team also found that Hepatitis B shares amino acid sequences with different autoantigens, further suggesting that the socalled autoantibodies may actually be created in response to pathogens (Barzilai et al., 2007) . Autoantibodies have been detected in patients without autoimmune disease during periods of infection. Berlin et al. collected sera from 88 patients with acute infections (41 bacterial, 23 viral, 17 parasitic, and 7 rikettsial (Berlin et al., 2007) ). Elevated titers of autoantibodies including annexin-V, prothrombin, ASCA, ANA, or antiphospholipid antibodies were detected in approximately half of the subjects, with 34 individuals harboring elevated titers of at least two \"autoantibodies.\"",

Thus, in addition to looking for antibodies to well-characterized pathogens, it is also important that we look for antibodies indicating the presence of the underlying chronic microbiota, some of which we may also be mistaking for autoantibodies. Like the pathogens that may create them, many of these antibodies may not yet be detected by standard testing. If this is the case, hundreds of pathogen-induced antibodies may exist and impact the autoimmune disease state, but the possible detection and correlation of such antibodies with specific components of the microbiota remains difficult until a much larger portion of the microbiota has been characterized.",

The result is that many doctors still believe that nonmucosal surfaces of the body are largely sterile and that bacteria and other pathogens are not driving factors in the autoimmune processes. Instead, the standard of care for patients with autoimmune disease continues to be corticosteroids and TNF-alpha blocking medications. According to a 2008 report, TNF-alpha inhibitors accounted for 80% of RA drug sales in the United States, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom, and Japan. Use of these immunosuppressants is still grounded in the theory that autoimmune disease results from an overly exuberant immune response and these drugs are administered without consideration for the presence of a metagenome. Whether helpful or harmful, there is no question that by dramatically slowing the immune response, such therapies must necessarily and profoundly affect the composition, development, and stability of the human microbiota.",

Several studies have shown that TNF-alpha production is required for the proper expression of acquired specific resistance following infection with M. tuberculosis (Allie et al., 2008; Arend et al., 2003) . So if we inhibit TNF-alpha expression, we would expect a long-term increase in the prevalence of not only tuberculosis, but also in any of the autoimmune or inflammatory diseases already associated with chronic forms of mycobacteria and other bacteria (Bull et al., 2003; Burnham et al., 1978) .",

Subjects are also administered subinhibitory bacteriostatic antibiotics, which weaken bacterial ribosomes so that pathogens can more easily be targeted by the reactivated immune system. Nearly all of the hundreds of patients to start the therapy reported the predicted increase in specific symptoms of their autoimmune diagnosis. After months, or sometimes years, of dealing with these symptomatic flares, the very symptoms that waxed and waned in synchronism with antibiotic administration began to disappear, resulting in improvement and, in many cases, eventual resolution of the disease process. This response has been noted in the widely varying diagnoses of sarcoidosis, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, Type 2 diabetes, uveitis, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, ankylosing spondylitis, chronic fatigue syndrome, and fibromyalgia among others. The often dramatic elevations in disease activity observed among study subjects -particularly during the early stages of therapy -cannot be attributed to side effects of the protocol medications, as individually the drugs are well known and unremarkable (Schwocho and Masonson, 2001) . Additionally, when healthy individuals have been administered the same medications they do not suffer any similar symptoms.",

            "text": "The most viable hypothesis for these temporary surges in disease symptoms and inflammatory markers is that treatment medications allow the immune system to mount an effective attack on an intracellular microbiota, such as the microbiota observed by Wirostko et al. It is reasonable to expect that when intraphagocytic pathogens are killed, some of the host cells will also undergo apoptosis, phagocytosis, or simply disintegration, leading to an increase in inflammation. For over 100 years, researchers have noted that the death of acute and persistent pathogens is accompanied by a surge in inflammation. They have attributed the temporary rise in inflammation to an increase in endotoxin and cytokine release upon bacterial death. Known as the Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction, or immunopathology, this phenomenon has been previously demonstrated after antibiotic administration in diseases including tuberculosis (Cheung and Chee, 2009) , borreliosis (Vidal et al., 1998) , tick-borne relapsing fever (Mitiku and Mengistu, 2002) , multiple sclerosis (Kissler, 2001) , Whipple disease (Peschard et al., 2001) , and syphilitic alopecia (Pareek, 1977) , among others. Zinkernagel also observed immunopathology in the mice he had infected with a persistent neuro-active virus (Zinkernagel et al., 2009) . Similarly, immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) is a condition seen in some cases of AIDS following the use of antiretroviral drugs. As the immune system begins to recover, it responds to previously acquired opportunistic infections with an overwhelming inflammatory response that, like the immunopathological reaction we observe, makes the symptoms of the infection temporarily worse (Shelburne et al., 2002) . At this point in time, the exact species or forms of bacteria potentially killed by any one subject in our own study cohort remain unknown. As the focus of the HMP moves beyond the mucosal surfaces, and catalogs L-forms and other intracellular species within body tissues, a clearer picture of disease pathogenesis will emerge. However, as long as patients continue to report improvement and recovery, determining the exact nature of pathogens being targeted by the therapy has not been a high priority, given the limited resources currently allocated to this research team.",

However, the reports of profound immunopathological reactions in autoimmune subjects imply the need to re-examine whether palliative drugs actually provide long-term benefit for patients with autoimmune disease. Whether at the doctor's office or the health food store, patients with autoimmune conditions continually seek out palliative drugs or supplements that successfully reduce symptoms by lowering inflammation. Yet, if bacteria drive the pathogenesis of autoimmune inflammation, and chronic bacterial death invariably results in temporary increases in discomfort, then treatments that mitigate symptoms may well do so at the expense of proliferation in pathogenic components of the microbiota. Commonly used immunosuppressive compounds include vitamin D, which, although its immunosuppressive properties have now been identified (Arnson et al., 2007) , is now viewed as the ultimate inexpensive wonder drug (Holick, 2008) . Frequent use of vitamin D, as well as other substances that slow immune activity, could at least partially account for the recently increased prevalence of nearly every autoimmune disease (Luque et al., 2006) .",

Not only do these L-form variants fail to succumb to antibiotics that target the bacterial cell wall, but those antibiotics also encourage the formation of L-forms. \"Treatment with penicillin does not merely select for L-forms (which are penicillin-resistant) but actually induces L-form growth,\" states Josep Casadesus of the University of Sevilla (Casadesus, 2007) . In fact, researchers deliberately culture classical forms of bacteria in conjunction with various beta-lactam antibiotics in order to create L-forms (Mattman, 2000) . The ability of the L-form to flourish in the face of treatment with the beta-lactam antibiotics points to a mechanism by which acute bacterial forms can mutate into latent mutants that may cause disease at a later time. Some researchers have deemed the conversion into the L-form state to be a universal property of bacteria (Gumpert and Taubeneck, 1983) .",

When the ability of the PBPs to create a full cell wall is blocked, the cells also become spherical and osmosensitive. Recently, Glover et al. performed the first systematic genetic evaluation of genes and pathways involved in the formation and survival of unstable L-form bacteria (Glover et al., 2009) . Microarray analysis of L-form versus classical bacterial colonies revealed many upregulated genes of unknown function as well as multiple overexpressed stress pathways shared in common with persister cells and biofilms.

Although mice have VDRs, the homology differs, and they express different genes than the human VDR. For example, the gene encoding the calcium-binding protein osteocalcin is \"robustly\" transcribed by the VDR in humans, but not in mice. Brahmachary et al. showed that the rat VDR does not express the cathelicidin AMPs, marking an important difference in the way the two species target invading pathogens (Brahmachary et al., 2006) . Gombart et al. recently expanded on the finding by providing evidence of an evolutionarily fixed, Alu-mediated divergence in steroid hormone nuclear receptor gene regulation between humans/primates and other mammals (Gombart et al., 2009 ). This divergence, which placed the cathelicidin pathway under VDR control only in humans and closely related primates, remained under purifying selection for the past 55-60 million years, and yet even cathelicidin in primates is not identical to that in man. Eventually, the pathway evolved to become a key component of a novel innate immune response unique to human infection. Because the murine VDR does not express cathelicidin, there is less of an evolutionary incentive for components of the murine microbiota to dysregulate its expression. This suggests that the survival mechanisms employed by the human and murine microbiotas may be very different. Thus, the intermingling of murine and human biologies in the literature hinders our ability to fully understand nuclear receptor control of the AMPs and other key aspects of innate immunity.",

            "text": "The prevailing theory of autoimmune disease, which dictates that the body creates autoantibodies that attack its own cells, was developed during an era when culture-based methods vastly underestimated the number of microbes capable of persisting in and on Homo sapiens. The advent of culture-independent tools such as 16S RNA sequencing, single cell sampling, and pyrosequencing has opened the door to an era of discovery. Rather than a sterile compartment, the human body is now known to teem with thousands of species of bacteria, viruses, and phages. In addition to persisting on the body's external surfaces, these microbes survive in the blood and in many of the tissues, which become inflamed during autoimmune disease, suggesting that what were once thought to be \"autoimmune\" processes may instead result from the presence of persistent microbes. Metagenomics is allowing us to study these microbes in the tissues within which they naturally persist, where they can be examined in the context of other microbes in their community. A more exact understanding of how networks of microbes can interact to cause disease has superseded Koch's postulates, which stipulate that a single microbe causes a single disease.",

Yet the expression of key human genes is continually altered by a plethora of microbial metabolites through an almost imponderable number of interactions. These metabolites, some of which are created by bacteria considered to be \"friendly\" or innocuous, can directly drive the pathogenesis of autoimmune disease by altering the expression of genes such as ACE and PTN22, genes associated with diagnoses including rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, diabetes mellitus, myocardial infarction, renal tubular dysgenesis, and Alzheimer's. It is becoming apparent that autoimmune processes cannot be fully understood if the human genome is studied in isolation. An understanding of the interactions between the human genome and the metagenome calls for a more nuanced understanding of the microbiota. Classifying certain microbes as purely commensal may underrepresent the full spectrum of their actions. Indeed, harmless species of bacteria and viruses can easily acquire virulent plasmids via horizontal gene transfer or homologous recombination.",

Pathogens such as M. tuberculosis, Borrelia, EBV, and HIV have evolved to dysregulate the VDR nuclear receptor, inhibiting expression of the beta-defensin and cathelicidin AMPs along with TLR2. Flow-on effects from VDR dysregulation can further alter AMP expression via (at least) the alpha-thyroid, androgen, and glucocorticoid nuclear receptors. This may result in the immunosuppression and hormonal imbalances characteristic of many autoimmune diagnoses.",

Successive infection dictates that even people with the same autoimmune diagnosis are unlikely to present with identical clusters of symptoms and helps explain the high levels of comorbidity observed among these patients. Common autoimmune comorbidities include inflammatory conditions such as cardiovascular disease, along with mental diagnoses such as depression or anxiety, suggesting these conditions may also be driven by the microbiota. Thus, insights gained from studying microbial composition in autoimmune disease can accelerate research in other areas of medicine. Recently, several studies have shown the presence of \"autoantibodies\" in autism with antinuclear antibody seropositivity showing a significant positive association with disease severity, mental retardation, and electroencephalogram abnormalities. Rather than assign autism to the end of a growing list of autoimmune diagnoses, this knowledge might be better used as a basis on which to further explore the role that components of the microbiota may play in driving the pathogenesis of disease.",

Polyspecific autoantibodies are increasingly being associated with elements of the microbiota, making it likely that the term \"autoimmune\" will soon lose its diagnostic utility. When a disabled immune system is forced to respond to the presence of a chronic microbiota, the resulting cascade of cytokines and chemokines will stimulate an adaptive immune response. The adaptive immune system will then proceed to generate antibodies to fragments of DNA generated by apoptosis or phagocytosis of infected cells. This is supported by studies showing that the so-called autoantibodies such as RO, La, dsDNA, and RF can be created in response to various bacterial and viral pathogens. Autoantibodies are often observed before a patient becomes fully symptomatic with an autoimmune diagnosis, reflecting the gradual accumulation of persistent microbes.",
