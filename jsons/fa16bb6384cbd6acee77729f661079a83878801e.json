The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) can cause acute lung injury (ALI) and even acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); with a fatality of 7.0%. Accumulating evidence suggested that the progression of COVID-19 is associated with lymphopenia and excessive inflammation, and a subset of severe cases might exhibit cytokine storm triggered by secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH). Furthermore, secondary bacterial infection may contribute to the exacerbation of COVID-19. We recommend using both IL-10 and IL-6 as the indicators of cytokine storm, and monitoring the elevation of procalcitonin (PCT) as an alert for initiating antibacterial agents. Understanding the dynamic progression of SARS-CoV-2 infection is crucial to determine an effective treatment strategy to reduce the rising mortality of this global pandemic.",

During viral infection, PRRs activate IRF and NF-\u03baB pathways by recognizing PAMP, then promote the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines from infected local epithelial cells or macrophages. These cytokineactivated macrophages and virus-infected dendritic cells (DC) lead to a broader immune response, attracting more inflammatory cells to inflammatory sites, releasing a large number of cytokines, which eventually, results in a cytokine storm. Excessive cytokines may spill into the circulatory system and cause systemic cytokine storms, resulting in multiple organ dysfunction [7, 57] .",

Unlike the cytokines profile of SARS patients, COVID-19 patients have a remarkable increase of anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-10 (Table 1) , which has been often seen in HLH patients in previous studies [61, 67, 68] . Compared with other increased cytokines, increased IL-10 was frequently associated with IL-6 in patients with severe disease (Table 1) , and subsets of activated T cells, as well as by non-immune cells like fibroblasts, epithelial cells, and keratinocytes [74] [75] [76] [77] . It can activate JAK/STAT, Ras/ERK/C/EBP, and P\u21603K/Akt pathways through IL-6R and signal-transducing coreceptor gp130 [78, 79] . IL-6 also regulates B cell proliferation and differentiation and induces T cell differentiation [80] [81] [82] . Although IL-6 has been proposed to be involved in the repair of lung injury in the mouse model of influenza A H1N1 virus [83] , it contributes to the pathogenesis of inflammatory or autoimmunity diseases [84, 85] , and excessive production of IL-6 leads to serious disease progression in viral infection [86, 87] .",

A retrospective study of continuous intravenous infusion of anakinra in five patients established a rapid serologic and subsequent clinical improvement in adult patients with sHLH [104] and a randomized, placebo-controlled phase III trial indicated that anakinra reduced mortality in sepsis patients with features of sHLH [105] . Tocilizumab, which attracts more attention compared with anakinra, was found to improve fever, hypoxemia, lung lesions, and CRP levels in most of the severe COVID-19 patients with no obvious adverse reactions in retrospective studies, but several patients still aggravated [106, 107] . Serum level of IL-6 after tocilizumab therapy tended to further spike initially, and then decrease, while the patients who failed treatment exhibited a persistent and dramatic increase of IL-6 [107, 108] . Nevertheless, we cannot draw any firm conclusions on the efficacy and safety of anakinra or tocilizumab due to the limited sample size and retrospective method of the present evidence. Further studies are required to determine the probability of potential secondary infection, and to find an appropriate biochemical indicator for monitoring the therapeutic effect.

( Table 2 ) Li et al [115] reported that 90.5% of deceased patients had elevated PCT levels (0.11-75ng/ml), including PCT > 0.25 ng/ml in 12 patients and PCT > 0.5ng/ml in 9 patients, and the PCT value increased from the admission to death. In another retrospective study of 1,099 COVID-19 patients, higher proportions of PCT > 0.5ng/ml were found in severe cases than mild cases (13.7% vs 3.7%) [8] . Patients who reached primary composite endpoint (including admission to an ICU, the use of mechanical ventilation, or death) had a higher proportion of PCT > 0.5ng/ml than patients without end-point events (24.0% vs 3.9%) [8] . The correlation between increased PCT and severe COVID-19 was also observed in pediatric patients [116] . These findings, although might be a better option. Previous studies have shown that in addition to antibacterial effects, these drugs can also alleviate inflammatory reactions by reducing the accumulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and regulating neutrophil function and apoptosis [117] [118] [119] [120] . including mean \u00b1 SD, median (IQR), and median (mix-max). c PCT value\u22650.05. d P-value of the comparison between the PCT value of two groups. e P-value of the comparison between the proportion of the patients with increased PCT value in two groups.

Timely measuring PCT as a sign of secondary bacterial infection for the decision of antibacterial agents use is critical for COVID-19 patients. The aggravation of COVID-19 ascribed to the secondary bacterial infection and the adverse events caused by unreasonable use of antibiotics could be reduced. The most effective selection of the antibiotic agents should be based on bacterial culture. In consideration of the dysregulation of the immune system in severe COVID-19 patients, antibiotic agents with immunomodulatory effects, such as macrolides (erythromycin and clarithromycin)",

SARS-CoV-2 could cause lymphopenia and cytokine storm, together with secondary bacterial infections, adding to the deterioration of the disease in severe cases of COVID-19. Understandings of the dynamic process of SARS-CoV-2 infection would help to make an appropriate decision on treatment strategies. We recommend measuring both IL-10 and IL-6 as a sign of intensification of cytokine storm in severe COVID-19 cases, though test IL-10 is not routinely carried out in the clinic setting.We also recommend using serum PCT level to guild the initiation of antibacterial agents in patientwith COVID-19. Although the selection of immunomodulators is challenging, previous retrospective studies have revealed distinct immune regulators between the early and late stages of SARS-CoV-2 infection. For instance, supplementation of type \u2160 IFN, instead of GCs, at the early stage of infection may help to control the virus and relieve injury. IL-1R and IL-6R antagonists could potentially be the effective choices for managing cytokine storm. However, these preliminary results would need to be validated from multiple ongoing RCTs. Due to the rapid nature of COVID-19 pandemic, global collaboration in research and information sharing is ultimately needed. Declaration of interest: None.",

Together with TGF-\u03b2, IL-6 leads to the activation of STAT3; thus relieving the repression of ROR\u03b3t and promoting the Th17 cells transcriptional program. It has also been established that IL-17 produced by activated Th17 cells are able to trigger a positive-feedback loop of IL-6 expression through NF-\u03baB and STAT3 signaling. Additionally, IL-6 prevents T cells from differentiating into Th1 cells through the inhibition of TNF-\u03b3 signaling by the upregulation of suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS1). IL-6 can also induce the production of endogenous IL-4, consequently driving the T cells to differentiate into Th2 cells. This, in turn, inhibits the differentiation and function of Th1 cells due to the cytokines produced from Th2 cells.",
