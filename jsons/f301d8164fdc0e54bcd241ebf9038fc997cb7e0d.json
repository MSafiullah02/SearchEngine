[1] [2] [3] [4] [5] Based on the results of an epidemiological study and an animal study, the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC) disclosed that disinfectants nebulized from humidifiers might be the cause of this lethal lung injury. [5] [6] [7] This disinfectant, which was composed of [2-(2-ethoxy) ethoxyethyl] guanidium chloride (PGH), polyhexamethyleneguanidine (PHMG), 5-chloro-2methylisothiazol-3(2H)-one (CMIT)/ 2-methylisothiazol-3-one (MIT), and didecyldimethylammonium chloride (DDAC), was reported to cause fatal lung injury and has been prohibited for any use that may lead to inhalation. [6] [7] [8] [9] Recently, a case-control study and a multicenter intervention study in Korea provided further evidence suggesting that the cause of this fatal ILD appeared to be the humidifier disinfectant. 10, 11 The American Thoracic Society and European Respiratory Society have recently updated guidelines for the diagnosis, classification, and management of ILD and children's interstitial lung disease (chILD). [12] [13] [14] However, ILD is still a very diverse disease group, with a high mortality and morbidity and an increasing prevalence. 15 There have been continuing efforts to determine reliable prognostic factors and effective treatments through increased understanding of the pathophysiology of ILD. 16, 17 Several possible prognostic markers have been proposed, including interleukin 8 (IL-8), matrix metalloproteinase (MMP), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), transforming growth factor beta (TGF-b), Krebs von den Lungen-6 (KL-6; a representative inflammatory and fibrotic cytokine), and monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (MCP-1). However, no biomarker has been established as a standard for the management of patients with ILD. [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] The current paradigm for understanding the pathophysiology of ILD involves chronic inflammation by repetitive injury to lung epithelial cells, followed by aberrant repair processes leading to excessive irreversible lung fibrosis. 23 This process may progress gradually or rapidly, and it may cease when lung damage is mild or progress to severe lung dysfunction. 16 Despite current medical advances, we are still unable to predict the exact progression and ultimate prognosis of this disease. Existing studies, which have generally focused on investigating clinical characteristics and cytokines at a single time, have been unable to determine factors that reliably predict the progress and prognosis of ILD. 21 There have been many efforts to determine the clinical prognostic factors of the humidifier disinfectant-associated children's interstitial lung disease (HD-chILD) because this ILD progressed rapidly and was refractory to all treatment in non-survivors, whereas the clinical course in survivors tended to be highly favorable. 1, 11 Disappointingly, no initial clinical characteristics, such as radiologic, pathologic, and laboratory findings, were significantly associated with survival. 1, 3, 11 The recently reported nationwide intervention study indicated that humidifier disinfectants could be the possible cause, but it mentioned the limitations caused by our lack of knowledge about the differences in individual susceptibility. 11 In this study, we compared serial changes in pulmonary inflammatory and fibrotic cytokines between survivors and non-survivors and evaluated whether patterns of change in these cytokines could be useful prognostic markers. We also examined potential correlations between changes in useful prognostic cytokines and clinical indices, such as radiologic, pathologic, and laboratory findings.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 198, "end": 201, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 202, "end": 205, "text": "[2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 206, "end": 209, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 210, "end": 213, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 214, "end": 217, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 451, "end": 454, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 455, "end": 458, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 459, "end": 462, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 504, "end": 517, "text": "[2-(2-ethoxy)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 819, "end": 822, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 823, "end": 826, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 827, "end": 830, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 831, "end": 834, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1026, "end": 1029, "text": "10,", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1030, "end": 1032, "text": "11", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1236, "end": 1240, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1241, "end": 1245, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1246, "end": 1250, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1369, "end": 1371, "text": "15", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1536, "end": 1539, "text": "16,", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1540, "end": 1542, "text": "17", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1973, "end": 1977, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1978, "end": 1982, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1983, "end": 1987, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1988, "end": 1992, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1993, "end": 1997, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 2228, "end": 2230, "text": "23", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 2361, "end": 2363, "text": "16", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 2707, "end": 2709, "text": "21", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 3036, "end": 3038, "text": "1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 3039, "end": 3041, "text": "11", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 3198, "end": 3200, "text": "1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 3201, "end": 3203, "text": "3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 3204, "end": 3206, "text": "11", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 3445, "end": 3447, "text": "11", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "INTRODUCTION"}, {"text": "A total of 17 children diagnosed with HD-chILD who were included in the patients reported in the previous nationwide report 11 were enrolled in this study.

Non-survivors were more likely to have persistent air leak syndrome and more extensive ground-glass attenuation and septal thickening on follow-up CT, which showed a potential possibility of serial CT findings as a prognostic tool; a higher neutrophil count on laboratory tests; and a greater number of macrophages on pathologic findings. The ground-glass attenuation, increased neutrophil counts, and increased macrophages reflect inflammation more than fibrosis.

This study provides meaningful information about the role of TGF-b1 in controlling inflammation and repairing acute lung injury in humans, especially children. Furthermore, the subjects were young children, who are usually difficult to include in research studies. Our study is of particularly importance when one considers the increasing concerns in recent years about chemical terrorism. It is the only study of acute lung injury due to a toxic inhalant that provides information about the pathophysiology, related therapeutic considerations, and prognostic factors, as determined by analyzing serial changes in cytokines, instead of single data. The most important limitations are the very limited number of patients and the analyzing of the only blood samples without any lung tissue and exudates, but it was inevitable because the clinical course of HD-chILD was severe, aggressive, and unpredictable. The small number of subjects, plus the irregular sampling and substantial quantity of missing cytokine data, made the statistical analysis difficult, although a generalized mixed model called a spaghetti plot was used to help overcome this. Also, we could only rely on interviewing with the parents whether the humidifier disinfectant was exposed to the children.
