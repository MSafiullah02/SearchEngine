To qualify as carnivorous, a plant must have at least one adaptation for active attraction, capture, digestion, and clear nutritional benefit from carnivory1. The convergent evolution of passive pitfall traps resulted in carnivorous pitcher plants of diverse orders and families, including Nepenthaceae (Caryophyllales), Cephalotaceae (Oxalidales), and Sarraceniaceae (Ericales) at distant geographical locations but sharing similar digestive fluid proteins2\u20134. A species-rich monotypic group of tropical pitcher plants from genus Nepenthes develop attractive pitchers of diverse shapes and sizes5. Recently, two highly conserved leaf developmental regulatory genes, ASYMMETRIC LEAVES1 (AS1) and REVOLUTA (REV), have been shown to be key in pitcher development from the leaf tips6.",

First, the attractive zone comprises the lid with nectars as baits to lure insects and the rim known as peristome often with striking colours. Second, the slippery waxy zone with epicuticular waxes covering the peristome and upper inside surface of pitchers8. Third, the digestive zone at the lower inside surface of pitchers with glands secreting acidic fluids and hydrolytic enzymes for the digestion and absorption of nutrients through transporters9,10. Insects often accidentally fall into pitchers from the slippery waxy peristome11.

The most abundant enzymes are proteases3,19, including aspartic protease Nepenthesins and prolyl endopeptidase neprosins15,20. Many proteins found are known to play roles in plant defence against microbial pathogens, such as thaumatin-like proteins and pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins21. The findings that many proteases, chitinases, and glucanases found in the pitcher fluids can also be classified as PR proteins led to the inference that offensive carnivory mechanism evolved from existing plant defensive mechanism against herbivory22. This is also supported by the conserved jasmonate signalling of enzyme secretion during prey capture23,24.",

            "text": "Nepenthes ampullaria Jack is a unique species with unusual growth patterns and pitcher morphology compared to other lowland Nepenthes species that typically grow in open sunny habitats. N. ampullaria produces dense clusters of uncovered squat-shaped wide-mouthed pitchers with highly flexed vestigial lids25. During its evolutionary progression towards detritivory, functionally redundant traits for prey attraction (nectar glands) and capture/retention (waxy zone and lunate cells) are lost, which reflect its adaption to leaf litter trapping on the forest floor under shady closed-canopy heath forests or peat swamps26. Pitchers of N. ampullaria are long-lived with a feeding period of over 8 months27 and adapted for slow and steady ammonium (NH4+) uptake from the slow breakdown of plant materials by commensal microbes, compared to short-lived (\u2264 3 months) pitchers with high turnover and prey capture rates28. Pitcher fluids of N. ampullaria are less acidic to maintain infauna (mosquito larvae and bacteria) for leaf litter decomposition and nutrient mineralisation29,30. Over half of the biomass of dead matter in the pitchers was plant-derived31, in which >35% of leaf nitrogen (N) is obtained from fallen leaves containing only 1.2% N26,32. The adaptive radiation of N acquisition in N. ampullaria through plant materials as well as insect prey by retaining a large slippery peristome in prey capture33 and endochitinase activities in the pitcher fluid34 explains its wide range of distribution and often co-exists with other insectivorous species25.",

Despite recent studies on the prey-induced secretion of digestive enzymes23,24, molecular data on the regulation of endogenous protein secretion and replenishment are still lacking to elucidate the molecular and physiological roots of plant carnivory mechanisms. Recently, we reported that certain proteins were replenished even without prey induction in the pitcher fluids of Nepenthes x ventrata within three days of pitcher opening37, which indicates molecular regulation of protein secretion in the pitchers in response to protein loss. In the current study, we performed detailed downstream transcriptomic analyses on the RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data from previously reported experiment38 to identify transcriptome-wide pitcher response to endogenous protein loss during early pitcher opening. We also repeated the experiment for RT-qPCR validation and reproducibility. The aim of this study is to generate functional annotations for the first reference transcriptome of N. ampullaria pitchers for further molecular studies. By using N. ampullaria as a model system to study carnivorous plant protein depletion, we address the following questions:How does the gene expression change during early pitcher opening?How the pitchers transcriptionally respond to the depletion of endogenous proteins in pitcher fluids?How the transcriptions of pitcher secretome and transportome are affected by protein depletion?What are the transcriptional regulatory factors responsive to the changes in pitcher fluid proteins?",

This might be a compensation for the loss of proteins involved in stress responses, which were highly expressed in newly opened pitchers (D0). Similarly, the enrichment of plant-pathogen interaction in 0v3L DEGs was corroborated by the upregulation of disease resistance proteins (Fig. S6).",

This indicates that young pitchers are still developing after pitcher opening with a physiological shift towards secondary metabolism and wax deposition. This is interesting because the waxy zone is absent in N. ampullaria pitchers but still retain the slippery peristome33. Therefore, it is indicative that peristome development is activated upon pitcher opening. Meanwhile, secondary metabolism involving phenylpropanoids and terpenoids might confer a protective effect against oxidative stress from cellular metabolism44.

The study shows that pitchers can respond to the loss of endogenous proteins by continuous secretion of certain proteins, such as aspartic proteinases, neprosin, a serine carboxypeptidase, a \u03b2-1,3-glucanase, a PR protein, and a TLP37. This is consistent with increased fluid protein content in newly opened N. alata pitchers50. However, the overall molecular response of pitchers was not discussed.",

Chitinases are antifungal and degrade insect cuticle, in which class IV endochitinases hydrolyse shorter chitin chains derived from the products of class III endochitinases from longer chitin polymers16,51.

Yet, Drosera rotundifolia secretes a beta-1,3-glucanase which cleaves plant glucans to simple sugars for absorption55. Glucanase could be repurposed in N. ampullaria to utilise nutrients from leaf litters. These enzymes may also contribute to the polysaccharidic network in the viscoelastic pitcher fluids for prey capture and retention13.

Other studies also revealed that pitchers can regulate enzyme activities24,46,58. This is likely involving Ca2+ and jasmonic acid (JA) signal transduction pathways22. In Drosera rotundifolia, both chitin and protein applications enhanced chitinase and protease activities59. Contrasting chitin, proteins seem to be much better inductors of various enzymes, such as phosphatases, proteases, and chitinases, in pitchers of Nepenthes46 and Sarracenia60. Proteins mimic the insect prey best and activate the highest expression of cysteine protease and type I chitinase in Venus flytrap61. However, it remains elusive on how the pitchers distinguish the different nature of endogenous enzymes from prey-derived proteins.",

The benefits vary with environmental conditions with different trade-offs between energy allocation to carnivory (trap organ, sugar-rich nectar, aroma chemicals, narcotic alkaloids, slippery wax crystals, hydrolytic enzymes, and other biochemicals/volatiles for prey attraction, capture, and digestion) relative to plant competitiveness and fitness (nutrient, photosynthetic rate, and growth)35.

N. ampullaria pitchers support a wide range of aquatic fauna, predominantly mosquito larvae66, which could decompose leaf litter in addition to bacterial degradation for N sequestration. However, nutrient gain from insectivory is still the best N source compared to detritivory for N. ampullaria as an omnivorous plant1. Therefore, compared with the complete switch of N. ampullaria long-lived pitchers to commensal-dependent detritivory, it is a better investment to maintain prey capture and digestion, such as peristome maturation and replenishment of digestive enzymes, for better nutrient gain from carnivory.",

This distinguishes wide-mouthed pitchers of N. ampullaria with wettable peristomes from narrow-mouthed pitchers with waxy scales of other Nepenthes species between rainier and drier areas. Hot and dry weather would increase the costs of maintaining pitcher fluid, whereby emptied pitchers experience much greater stresses. This could explain our personal observations that pitchers are likely to senesce in total loss of proteins, compounds, minerals, and fluid. Therefore, D3L pitchers were refilled with filtrates to simulate only protein loss in this study. We cannot exclude the possibility that some of the DEGs in D3L might be induced by the stress during temporary emptying of pitchers for protein filtration. However, it will be difficult to tease apart such effects in a protein replenishment experiment done in situ. Further studies under a controlled environment will be useful to identify the transcriptional response to pitcher fluid loss to be distinguished from protein loss per se.",

Therefore, we speculate that the response to protein loss, as a stochastic event, is also at an individual pitcher-level. Further study will be required to determine the trade-offs and systemic transcriptional/physiological responses, if exist, in other pitchers at the whole-plant level. It will also be interesting to apply the same approach to investigate local and systemic responses to exogenous protein application or prey capture in the future.",

PCR specificity was confirmed by end-cycle melt curve analysis and no-template controls (NTCs). Primer efficiency was determined based on a standard curve with five serial dilutions. RT-qPCR analysis was performed using three biological replicates, each with three technical replicates.
