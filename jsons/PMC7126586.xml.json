            "text": "In built environments such as Hong Kong and other Asian cities, electricity consumption has increased rapidly since the 1970s. The growth of electricity consumption is partly attributed to population growth, economic growth, change in life style, and the expansion of the services sector. According to the Hong Kong Census and Statistics Department, Hong Kong's electricity consumption increased from 4451 million kWh in 1970 to 41,862 million kWh in 2010 (Censtatd, 2011a). Hong Kong's population increased from 4.00 millions in 1970 to 7.10 millions in 2010 (Censtatd, 2011b), total gross domestic product (GDP) from US$ 22.6 billion in 1970 to US$ 223.9 billion in 2010 (both figures chained to 2009), and contribution of the services sector to the total GDP from 62 percent in 1970 to over 92 percent in 2010. Nowadays, Hong Kong's per capita electricity consumption and electricity productivity are 5898 kWh/year and US$ 5.35 per kWh/year \u2013 one of the highest electricity productivity in the world, respectively. Nevertheless, the surge of electricity consumption also leads to rapid increase in pollutant emissions. The discharge of greenhouse gases including carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide, and other gaseous pollutants such as sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxides will not only contribute to the global climate change (IPCC, 2007), but also causes adverse effects on human health (Kampa and Castanas, 2008; Markandya et al., 2009; Wong et al., 2002). Combining with a high level of particulate matters, aerosols, and other organic matters discharged from various sources, the number of haze days in many Asian cities has increased rapidly in the past ten years, especially in winter months between October and March (Lam and Lau, 2005). The number of severe respiratory and cardiovascular diseases was also found to be strongly associated with the concentrations of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides in Hong Kong (Wong et al., 2002). For these reasons, this paper explores the growth patterns of electricity consumption, population, and GDP in Hong Kong. We also apply the life cycle approach (To et al., 2011) to determine the environmental impact of the electricity consumption of Hong Kong.",

            "text": "The relationships between electricity consumption, population, and economic growth have been the focus of intense research over the past fifty years. Foss (1963) showed that electricity consumption was strongly associated with the utilization of capital equipment, in turn affected economic growth in an industrial country such as the United States. Headthfield (1972) followed Foss's idea to measure capital usage using electricity consumption data in the United Kingdom. Costello (1993) performed a cross-country, cross-industry comparison of productivity growth and suggested that electricity consumption, as a measure of capital usage, was strongly associated with productivity/economic growth. Ehrlich and Holdren (1971) published their article \u201cImpact of Population Growth\u201d in Science. They reported that there was 760 percent increase in electricity consumption from 1940 to 1969 and suggested that this increase was partly contributed to increase in population and electrification of the society. Brown and Koomey (2003) and Lai et al. (2008) found that population growth partly contributed to the growth of electricity consumption in California and Macao, respectively. In Hong Kong, Lam (1998), Lam et al. (2008), and Yan (1998) investigated the effect of climate on residential and commercial electricity consumption. They showed that electricity consumption increased rapidly during the summer months and concluded that air conditioning consumed more than 50 percent of the total amount of electricity consumption in the residential and commercial sectors. Other researchers approached the associations between electricity consumption, GDP, and/or population using econometric modeling (Chontanawa et al., 2008; Kraft and Kraft, 1978; Lai et al., 2011; Lee, 2005; Meherara, 2007; Sharma, 2010; Soytas and Sari, 2003; Yoo, 2006). Many of them reported that the long-run and short-run causal relationships from electricity consumption to GDP exist in most developing countries and cities (Chontanawa et al., 2008; Lai et al., 2011; Soytas and Sari, 2003). However, there were mixed causal relationships in many other countries (Sharma, 2010). In fact, none of the extant literature has examined the fuel life cycle impact of electricity consumption on the environment in Hong Kong.",

            "text": "According to the US EPA (2006), life cycle analysis is a technique for identifying significant environmental aspects of a product, process and (or) service and evaluating the associated impacts on the environment. It consists of four major stages; (i) defining the goals and scopes of the study, (ii) compiling an inventory of energy and material inputs and pollutant emissions; (iii) assessing the impacts associated with the identified inputs and emissions on natural resources, ecosystem and human health; and (iv) interpreting the analyzed results that help management/policy-makers in a decision-making process. A comprehensive life cycle analysis is normally a \u201cforward\u201d approach in which an analyst uses a multi-layer procedure to identify and determine direct and indirect use of resources and pollutant emissions along raw materials extraction and processing, components production, production of a product/service, and consumption and disposal of a product/service. However, as the number of layers increases, uncertainties increase (Ney and Schnoor, 2002). Recently, To et al. (2011) propose the life cycle approach to analyze greenhouse gases emissions due to the electricity consumption of Macao. By realizing that Macao, as most other cities, does not have primary energy sources, To et al. (2011) traced backward to locate the sources of primary energy and determined the direct emissions due to the fossil fuel extraction, processing, transportation, and combustion. They demonstrated that greenhouse gases emissions could be underestimated by (i) neglecting the emissions from the extraction, transportation, and refining of fuels, and (ii) not taking the imported electricity into consideration. Extending To et al.'s (2011) approach, this study focused on emissions of greenhouse gases and other pollutants due to the electricity consumption of Hong Kong. We determined the direct emission of air pollutants from the extraction, processing, transportation, refining, storage, and combustion of fuels.",

Hong Kong transformed to a commercial and trading center in the 1980s when manufacturers started moving their labor-intensive operations to mainland China. Over the past two decades, Hong Kong has transformed itself as an international finance center, emphasizing its strong link between East and West and a gateway to mainland China. In the past couple of years, Hong Kong has benefited significantly from the Individual Visit Scheme and its Close Economic Partnership Arrangement with mainland China. Under the Individual Visit Scheme, 0.27 billion residents in 49 Mainland cities are allowed to visit Hong Kong in their individual capacity. In 2010, Hong Kong attracted over 36 million visitors and most of them were short stay visitors from mainland China. Electricity consumption grew by an order of magnitude between 1970 and 2010. More specifically, the commercial electricity consumption increased by 19 times between 1970 and 2010. Fig. 1\nshows Hong Kong's electricity consumption from 1970 to 2010.",

The change in R\n2 value between the data sets 1970\u20132010 and 1970\u20131997 can be understood because Hong Kong has gone through two critical changes in the past fourteen years. The first one was the Asian financial turmoil in 1997 in which Hong Kong's economic was slowed down drastically. The second one was the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003. And fortunately, Hong Kong has benefited greatly from the Individual Visit Scheme and Close Economic Partnership Arrangement with mainland China since then. The predicted values of Hong Kong's total GDP are also shown in Fig. 4. It should be noted that a discontinuous 4-parameter logistic function could be employed to model Hong Kong's GDP closely; one (as given in Eq. (2)) for the period 1970\u20131997, and another one for the period 1998\u20132010.

In addition, there were 210 kilotonnes of CO2, 4679 tonnes of SO2, and 5936 tonnes of NOx for fuel transport, and 384 kilotonnes of CO2-equivalent, 108 tonnes of SO2, and 109 tonnes of NOx for the extraction and processing of fuels. Hence, the fuel life cycle for Hong Kong's power plants produced 29.82 million tonnes CO2-equivalent greenhouse gases, 22557 tonnes of SO2, and 33055 tonnes of NOx. As the plants generated 38292 million kWh in 2010, emission factors due to the electricity generated locally was 778.8 g CO2-equivalent/kWh, 0.589 g SO2/kWh, 0.862 g NOx/kWh using the life cycle approach. However, Hong Kong imported 11046 million kWh of electricity, 26 percent of the electricity consumed in 2010, from the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant located in Shenzhen. Sovacool (2008) examined 103 life cycle studies of greenhouse gas emissions for nuclear power plants and found that 19 studies were the most up-to-date and transparent according to their methodologies and data sources. He concluded that the emissions for nuclear energy over the lifetime of a power plant should range from 14 to 288 g CO2-equivalent/kWh. Specifically, Sovacool (2008) found that the mining, processing and transportation of nuclear fuels would emit 0.58\u2013118 g (mean: 25.09 g) CO2-equivalent/kWh while the operation of a nuclear plant would produce 0.1\u201340 g (mean: 11.58 g) CO2-equivalent/kWh. By taking the net imported electricity with 36.67 g CO2-equivalent greenhouse gases emissions per kWh, emission factors due to the electricity consumption of Hong Kong would be 722.1 g CO2-equivalent/kWh, 0.539 g SO2/kWh, and 0.790 g NOx/kWh.",

The values of CO2, CH4 and N2O emissions for coal, LNG, heavy oil, and light gas oil follow lognormal distributions [27]. In order to assess the impact on the overall emissions, Monte Carlo simulations were performed 1000 times, using lognormal distributions for pollutant emissions due to fuel combustion and uniform distributions for the others. The results showed that emission factors due to the electricity generated locally was 776 g CO2-equivalent/kWh with the 95 percent confidence interval of [735, 820], 0.589 g SO2/kWh with the 95 percent confidence interval of [0.587, 0.591], 0.863 g NOx/kWh with the 95 percent confidence interval of [0.861, 0.866].",

Fig. 8\nshows that greenhouse gases emission ranged from 774.6 to 832.6 g CO2-equivalent/kWh between 2002 and 2010. It also shows that SO2 emission peaked at 2.493 g/kWh in 2003 and then dropped to 0.589 g/kWh in 2010 while NOx emission peaked at 1.708 g/kWh in 2003 and then dropped to 0.863 g/kWh in 2010. Fig. 9\nshows the energy mix in Hong Kong's power industry during the period 2002 to 2010. By performing a covariance analysis between the coal consumed in percentage and air pollutants discharged, it was found that greenhouse gases emission was strongly and positively associated with the coal consumed in percentage (R\n2 = 0.913, p < 0.001). Results of the covariance analysis also indicated that NOx emission was strongly and significantly associated with the coal consumed (R\n2 = 0.646, p < 0.01) and SO2 emission was moderately associated with the coal consumed (R\n2 = 0.406, p = 0.07). Nevertheless, it should be noted that SO2 emission was affected by changing fuel mix, sources of fuels, and improvement works in power plants.

Unfortunately, high electricity productivity comes at an environmental cost. By analyzing the data of electricity consumption, population, and GDP in Hong Kong spanning over the past forty years, it was found that the growth of electricity consumption resembled a logistic growth curve closely, population increased quite linearly, and increase in GDP could be modeled accurately using a discontinuous logistic function. The pair-wise comparisons indicated that the growth of electricity consumption was partly contributed by the increase of population, and the growth of electricity consumption and change in GDP were strongly associated. In fact, the later pair was characterized very accurately by a piece-wise linear relationship with a turning point in 2003 \u2013 the year Hong Kong's economic to be badly hit by the SARS epidemic but fortunately then fully supported by the Central Government for its preferential policy on the development of the finance and tourism sectors.",

However, Hong Kong imported electricity from a nuclear power plant in Shenzhen with relatively low CO2-equivalent emission at 36.67 g CO2-equivalent/kWh. By taking account of the imported electricity and the associated greenhouse gases emissions, emission factors due to the electricity consumed in Hong Kong would be 722.1 g CO2-equivalent/kWh, 0.539 g SO2/kWh, and 0.790 g NOx/kWh. We also found that the extraction, production, transportation, and processing of fossil fuels contributed to 1.65, 5.65, and 5.72 percent of the overall greenhouse gases emissions for coal, heavy oil and light gas oil, and 3.48 and 4.19 percent of the overall greenhouse gases emissions for LNG from China and Australia, respectively. By using the logistic growth model of Hong Kong's electricity consumption, it is expected that there is a net increase of 1624 million kWh from 2010 to 2015, representing an increase of 3.87 percent. Assuming that there is no change in the imported electricity from the nuclear power plant in Shenzhen, Hong Kong's power companies need to generate an additional 4.86 percent of electricity locally, resulting in a probable increase of 1.42 million tonnes of CO2-equivalent.",

Nevertheless, this strategy will not solve the problem because the electricity demand in Shenzhen has also surged rapidly in the past two decades. Besides, the true cost of nuclear power shall not be underestimated, from both environmental and economic perspectives. Sovacool (2008) concluded that the emissions for nuclear energy over the lifetime of a power plant should range from 14 to 288 g CO2-equivalent/kWh. Specifically, he indicated that the construction, treatment of nuclear waste, and decommissioning of a nuclear power also contributed quite significantly to greenhouse gases emissions indirectly. In terms of the economic cost, the Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant \u2013 the one supplying over 10,000 million kWh electricity to Hong Kong every year \u2013 cost US$ 4 billion in construction in 1994. The pressurized water reactors have a life-span of 40 years. At the end of their life, it is expected that US$ 1.3 billion needs to be spent for the plant's decommissioning. By taking all construction, operating and decommissioning expenditures into consideration, the levelized cost of electricity from nuclear power is about US$ 0.05 per kWh (Grubler, 2010). However, in light of the disaster in Fukushima nuclear power stations, a nuclear accident may eventually cost US$ 30 billion for containment, not counting the potential loss of human lives and destruction of ecosystems in the affected region.",
