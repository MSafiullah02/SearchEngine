Seroconverted, naturally infected, captive-bred chimpanzees represented 61% of the laboratory population, which demonstrated that captive animals are readily infected with HMPV (9). Worldwide, nearly 100% of the human population has seroconverted to HMPV by 10 years of age, and most illness and death occurs in young, elderly, and immunocompromised persons, although persons in any age group can become infected (10,11). Immunity is transient, and reinfections with the same or different strains are common, but illness is reduced (10,11). Recent evidence suggests these findings are also found in captive and wild chimpanzees (9,12) and other primates (13). In this instance, the congenital thoracic defect may have affected the ability of the chimpanzee to survive. In contrast to other cases in which apes were infected with Streptococcus pneumoniae (3\u20135), only rare lung bacteria were observed histologically and lung bacterial cultures were negative. These findings, in combination with the absence of major suppurative inflammation, suggest that HMPV was the primary pathogen.",

Because HMPV is a recently discovered virus that closely resembles other respiratory viruses in its clinical course and few animal facilities specifically test for it, the degree of illness associated with this disease in the captive great ape population is unknown. Therefore, enhanced biosecurity and disease surveillance measures for HMPV should be considered for great apes. In addition to the commonly tested viral respiratory pathogens of great apes, surveillance for HMPV by serologic analysis at quarantine or preventative medical examinations would provide additional benefits. These procedures would enable management to tailor biosecurity protocols and procedures to limit the risk for exposure of HMPV-negative animals or troops, particularly during the height of the HMPV season.",
