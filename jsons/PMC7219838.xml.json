            "text": "Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly infectious and sometimes deadly pathogen. It was first reported as an unknown form of pneumonia to the World Health Organization (WHO) at the end of December 20191. A single-stranded RNA genome consistent with a coronavirus was isolated and given the name severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), which the WHO labeled COVID-19 in early February 20202. The disease has since spread globally, resulting in the ongoing pandemic, with more than a million confirmed cases worldwide. Initial reports had localized the disease to the Hubei province of China, but, by January 20, 2020, Japan, South Korea, and Thailand had reported their first cases3. The first case in the United States was identified in Washington State on January 21, 2020. On March 11, the WHO characterized the COVID-19 outbreak as a pandemic\u2014the first since 20094. Two days later, the President of the United States declared a national state of emergency5, which reinforced the strong recommendations to curtail elective procedures as put forth by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS)6, the Surgeon General, and the American College of Surgeons (ACS)7. In the following weeks, 35 states, including Washington, Colorado, Massachusetts, and New York, went further, placing moratoriums on elective procedures in order to prevent spread of the virus and to preserve the supply of personal protective equipment (PPE) and ventilators7,8. The cessation of elective surgery has jeopardized the financial solvency of many health-care organizations already in distress as a result of the crisis.",

Hospital profit margins on average are not able to overcome these losses. This will cause financial constraints for hospitals and surgeons, leading to budget cuts and employee furloughs.

Although it is still unclear how the $100 billion will be allotted (e.g., demand versus caseload, rural versus urban, academic versus community organizations), the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) has been empowered to quickly oversee its distribution, providing hospitals with funding for expenses relating to constructing temporary structures and obtaining medical supplies (e.g., ventilators, PPE).

Orthopaedic private practices face additional costs for maintaining ambulatory surgical centers and high medical malpractice costs, while reduced reimbursement rates have increased the capital expenditures needed to run a successful practice. As a result, orthopaedic practices have become reliant on elective procedures, exposing them to increased financial risk. The COVID-19 crisis has resulted in the rapid cancellation of elective procedures, replacing revenue with liabilities as seen in the hypothetical example shown in Table I. The moratorium on elective procedures, combined with the high overhead costs of maintaining a private orthopaedic practice, has placed orthopaedic groups in a difficult position. New England Orthopedic Surgeons, based in Springfield, Massachusetts, has had to withhold all surgeon pay and furlough 168 employees16. Similarly, the Rothman Institute, in Philadelphia, has made the decision to retain employees in lieu of paying its surgeons17. Many other orthopaedic groups are facing the same challenges. Emergency funding from the government loan programs offers potential aid for private orthopaedic practices during this crisis.",

            "text": "The CARES Act has designated an additional $350 billion in new loans to small businesses, which include private orthopaedic practices13. The United States Small Business Administration (SBA) now has several programs available for businesses with \u2264500 employees (Table II)18. The program most applicable to private orthopaedic practices is the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), which provides a maximum of $10 million or 2.5 times the average monthly payroll in 2019 (whichever is less). In addition, regulators have reduced all SBA-levied fees, the maximum interest rate is locked at 1%, and a guarantor is no longer needed. These loans are eligible for full or partial forgiveness if used to fund (1) payroll, (2) utilities, (3) rent, (4) mortgage, and/or (5) existing business debt. To maintain eligibility for forgiveness, businesses must not terminate contracts with current employees or must rehire employees and maintain employment until the end of June. If the number of employees is reduced during the first 8 weeks after loan distribution, the amount of forgiveness will decrease, and, if the employees who were laid off made <$100,000 per year, the amount of forgiveness may further decrease. Notably, the PPP can be combined with other SBA programs, including the Economic Injury Disaster Loan (EIDL) program; however, these programs have funding caps and are being dispensed on a rolling basis. Unfortunately, given the high capital expenditure inherent to orthopaedic surgery practices, the PPP and EIDL loans will not be sufficient for the largest groups. It is still unclear which loan programs these large groups will qualify for.",
