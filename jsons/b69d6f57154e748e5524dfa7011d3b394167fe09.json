The phylogenetic analyses of partial SVCV glycoprotein gene sequences classified the isolates into the Ia genogroup. These findings make this the first report of SVCV detection in Mexico, extending the southern geographical range of SVCV within North America. However, since this pathogen was detected in fish inhabiting a natural body of water without tributaries or effluents, it is difficult to estimate the risk of SVCV for other wild/feral cohabitating cyprinid species in the lagoon. The status of this virus is also unknown for other bodies of water within this region.",

In turn, V\u00e9lez-Hern\u00e1ndez, Constantino-Casas, Garc\u00eda-M\u00e1rquez, and Osorio-Sarabia (1998) All 10 specimens were collected from Tecocomulco, a natural freshwater lagoon in the state of Hidalgo that is approximately 1,769 hectares in size and without tributaries or effluents (Rico-S\u00e1nchez, Rodr\u00edguez-Romero, L\u00f3pez-L\u00f3pez, & Sede\u00f1o-D\u00edaz, 2014) . The lagoon is formed by run-off and springs from the surrounding mountains, has an average length of 10.5 km, is between 1.0 and 3.5 km wide and has a depth, depending on periods of drought, between 70 cm and 2 m (Novelo, Montejano, Cantoral, & Tavera, 2005) . No disease outbreaks and/or disease-related mortalities have been reported for the lagoon for any of the different fish populations. Common carp (\u2248250 g) were captured using a net that traps the fish through the gills.

While SVCV can replicate in fish, bird and mammalian cell cultures, optimal cell systems are those derived from cyprinid fish, such as EPC (Fijan et al., 1983) , which grows at 20-22\u00b0C. The CPE of SVCV is characterized by a margination of nuclear chromatin followed by a rounding up, detachment and lysis of cells. The presently obtained results are consistent with these descriptions. However, given that SVCV is closely related to the pike fry rhabdovirus, an SVCV-specific RT-PCR was used to obtain a more precise identification (Stone et al., 2003) . The second round of the semi-nested PCR protocol amplified a prominent 606-bp product corresponding to nucleotides 373-978 of the SVCV glycoprotein. Genetic clustering and geographical origin are closely linked for SVCV strains, which can be divided into the Asian and European clades (Miller et al., 2007; Stone et al., 2003) . Phylogenetic analysis of the partial glycoprotein genes obtained for the SVCV isolates (Carp-1 and Carp-2) for mortalities in adult rainbow trout. Likewise, tilapia, zebrafish and even trout could act as carriers of this viral agent (Emmenegger et al., 2016; OIE, 2017b) .",

For example, after the first SVCV outbreak at a koi farm in North America in 2002, eight subsequent SVCV detections or outbreaks have been recorded (Emmenegger et al., 2016) . This exotic virus could, therefore, represent a potential threat to native and culture fish populations in Mexico. Further contributing to this potential threat is that one of the factors related to SVCV appearance is the temperature range in which fish live, with 10-17\u00b0C being optimum (Ahne et al., 2002) .",

Alignments were performed with the ClustalW algorithm against phylogenetically related organisms available in the GenBank database. The genetic distance analyses were performed using Kimura's two-parameter model, and evolutionary trees were constructed using the neighbour-joining method with MEGA 7.0(Kumar, Stecher & Tamura 2016). Bootstrap values were obtained from 1,000 replicates. The two obtained nucleotide sequences (coded Carp-1 and Carp-2) were deposited with the GenBank accession numbers MH569093 and MH569094. and haemorrhages at the base of the pectoral and pelvic fins in lateral areas (Figure 1a). Internally, five fish pre-sented sero-haemorrhagic ascites and the formation of adhesions between abdominal organs, and three fish manifested diffuse haemorrhages in the coelomic cavity, splenomegaly, congestion of the swim bladder, renomegaly and renal congestion (Figure 1b). Some fish presented scale loss and haemorrhages inside the mouth and on the lower jaw (data not shown). Parasitological analysis revealed the presence of Trichodina sp. on the skin and gills and Gyrodactylus spp. on only the skin of 10 fish (data not shown). No parasitic agents were found in internal organs, and bacterial growth was not obtained for any of the sampled internal organs or for the ascetic liquid of fish with haemorrhages independent of the culture medium used. Likewise, Gram-stained imprints of these tissues did not reveal any bacterial presence. Histologically, the liver of affected fish presented perivascular haemorrhages (Figure 2a) with lymphatic degeneration and infiltration in the vascular walls, multifocal mononuclear hepatitis, hyperaemia with multiple areas of degeneration and necrosis, lymphocytic pancreatitis, necrosis and periacinar lymphocytic infiltration (Figure 2b). The kidney evidenced haemorrhagic and interstitial mononuclear nephritis, renal congestion, tubular dilation with proteinuria (Figure 2c), perirenal haemorrhagic cystitis, tubular degeneration with obstruction, kidney and spleen homogenates (Carp-1 and Carp-2) of affected fish showed a CPE between 24 and 48 hr post-inoculation in EPC cell cultures, and 72 hr post-inoculation in BF-2 cell cultures. These results suggest that the clinical signs of disease observed in the common-carp specimens were caused by a viral agent. This hypothesis was confirmed via electron microscopy, which revealed an abundance of characteristic bullet-shaped viral particles with structural traits typical of rhabdovirus (110-123 nm long, 75.5-78.1 nm wide; Figure 3). RT-PCR analyses conducted using the total extracted RNA from EPC and BF-2 cell cultures resulted positive for putative SVCV, independent of the cell line employed for viral isolation. The expected specific amplification product for SVCV was observed, with a size of 716 bp for the first reaction and of 606 bp for the second round.No product was generated with the negative control (Figure 4). The two amplification products were sequenced separately, in duplicate, and in both directions by Macrogen Inc. (Korea). This resulted in contigs with reads averaging 702 \u00b1 12 and 573 \u00b1 5 bp, showing that Carp-1 and Carp-2 were 100% similar.

Spring viraemia of carp virus is an OIE-notifiable finfish rhabdovirus of major economic importance (OIE, 2017a). Unfortunately, the SVCV pathogen obtained from Mexican common carp was not confirmed by an international reference laboratory, nor has detection been reported to the OIE. Nevertheless, the Mexican sanitary authorities (National Service of Health, Safety, and Agroalimentary Quality SENASICA, Spanish acronym) have been duly informed. SVCV can be particularly devastating for the carp aquaculture industry and has also been reported to infect other commercially important species, including sheatfish (Silurus glanis), European perch (Perca fluviatilis), goldfish (Carassius spp.), zebrafish (Danio rerio), rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) and tilapia (Sarotherodon niloticus) (OIE, 2017a). In addition to distinct varieties of carp, other aquaculture species farmed in Mexico could be impacted by SVCV (including rainbow trout and tilapia [CONAPESCA, 2017], as well as ornamental fish such as goldfish, zebrafish and other cyprinids). Such impacts can include death, as has been reported by Haghighi-Khiabanian Asl, Bandehpour, Bandehpour, Sharifnia, and Kazemi (2008), who detected a molecularly uncharacterized SVCV-like virus responsible",

The present study describes a case of septicaemic disease in wild common carp obtained from a lagoon without tributaries or effluents in central Mexico. Tissue samples collected from fish exhibiting clinical signs were analysed via cell cultures, molecular techniques, gene sequencing and electronic microscopy, ultimately resulting in the isolation and identification of a rhabdovirus with traits similar to SVCV. In October 2015, a total of 10 wild common carp (C. carpio) were collected as the result of a health-monitoring programme for fish in central Mexico. The collected carp were delivered alive within 24 hr of collection to the Aquatic Animal Health Laboratory (Facultad de Medicina Veterinaria y Zootecnia, Universidad Aut\u00f3noma del Estado de M\u00e9xico, Toluca, M\u00e9xico).",

On the other hand, the clinical occurrence of an SVCV outbreak in goldfish specimens in a lake near Sao Paulo (Brazil) resulted in a 70% mortality rate(Alexandrino et al., 1998). In addition to the inherent difference of the involved infectious agents, variations in the manifested clinical signs, injuries and mortalities could be related to management practices and environmental conditions. In this case, it could be that the fish inhabited a large lagoon without spatial restrictions and with low stress. However, it is hard to calculate the impacts of several factors, including of fishing activities; sanitary and livestock drainage discharge; erosion; and the gradual extraction of water for farming, which results in new vegetation(Delgadillo, 2012). All of these factors could serve as environmental stressors that affect pathogenesis transmission and organism infection.When and how the virus was introduced into the TecocomulcoLagoon is unknown, but considering that between 1996 and 1997 the lagoon practically dried up, infection is likely a relatively recent occurrence. Also of possible relevance, this site is host to nearly 120 bird species, 78 of which are land species and 42 of which are aquatic species (Gobierno del estadode Hidalgo, 2003). Of the aquatic birds, 29 migrate from North America, where SVCV has been detected in wild(Garver et al., 2007) and farmed(OIE, 2017a)  fish. It is important to underscore that the objective of this study is not to clarify the origin of the SVCV in fish from the Tecocomulco Lagoon, which, asa closed body of water, could mean a range of possibilities, such as the virus being introduced through carp stocking (a common practice in Mexico since the end of the 19th century; Tapia & Zambrano, 2003; Wakida-Kusunoki & Amador-del-\u00c1ngel, 2011); through migratory birds acting as viral vector carriers (Ahne et al., 2002); or even through the importation of ornamental fish, including different types of cyprinids, zebrafish and guppy (Poecilia reticulata; Zambrano",
