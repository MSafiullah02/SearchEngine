In patients with sepsis, thrombocytopenia may not merely be a marker of disease severity but even play a causative role in increased sepsis morbidity and mortality [6, 7].

            "text": "Sialic acid is a natural sugar acid compound that exists widely across organisms [21]. The ends of glycoprotein chains on platelet membranes are all covered by sialic acid to protect the platelets from being destroyed. Sialidases, also known as neuraminidases, are sialic acid-releasing exoglycosidases that catalyze the removal of terminal sialic acids from sialosides and sialoglycoconjugates in nature [22]. Sialidase widely exists in viruses, bacteria, and mammalian cells [23]. Additionally, resting platelets contain an internal pool of sialidases which are released upon activation from any cause or after a pathogenic bacterium-released new sialidase is introduced into the serum. The endogenous and exogenous sialidases hydrolyze terminal sialic acid moieties from platelet glycoproteins [19, 24]. Several studies in murine models suggested that sialidases released or upregulated during infections hydrolyze sialic acid from platelet glycoproteins [25, 26]. Desialylation leads to the exposure of \u03b2-galactose residues on platelets, which can be recognized by AMRs on hepatocytes and eventually results in platelet phagocytosis in the liver [27, 28]. It becomes increasingly evident that desialylation is responsible for, at least in part, the pathogenesis of thrombocytopenia in many diseases and the clearance of transfused platelets after storage [29]. Desialylation-induced platelet removal could possibly be circumvented by adding sialidase inhibitors during sepsis or after refrigeration [19, 30, 31].",

It is a viral sialidase inhibitor that prevents the release of progeny virions, thus limiting the spread of infection [32]. Several studies indicate the feasibility that oseltamivir can be used for the treatment of infection-associated thrombocytopenia. Oseltamivir could elevate platelet counts in the treatment of pediatric as well as adult flu patients with thrombocytopenia [30, 33]. Recently, we reported the successful treatment with oseltamivir phosphate of a patient with chronic immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) and influenza [34]. Hence, we hypothesized that thrombocytopenia was associated with increased platelet desialylation in septic patients and that the addition of oseltamivir to an antibiotic therapy would improve the clinical outcome in severe sepsis patients with thrombocytopenia. The study demonstrates that platelet desialylation is a novel mechanism in thrombocytopenia during sepsis. It would provide valuable theoretical foundation and therapeutic targets for the clinical treatment of septic thrombocytopenia.",

Within 15 days after randomization, platelet response was achieved in 45 of the 54 patients in the oseltamivir group (83.3%) compared with 34 of the 52 patients in the control group (65.4%; P = 0.045). In patients who had a platelet response, the platelet recovery time was 5 days with quartiles of 4\u20136 days in the oseltamivir group compared with 7 days with quartiles of 5\u201310 days in the control group (P = 0.003). Additional file 1: Figure S2 displays the changes in the platelet counts of the oseltamivir and control groups over time. At baseline, the platelet counts were 41.81 \u00b1 10.29 \u00d7 109/L in the oseltamivir group and 46.69 \u00b1 9.13 \u00d7 109/L in the control group, with no significant difference between these two groups (P = 0.560). Platelet counts in both groups increased over time and reached 91.30 \u00b1 21.51 \u00d7 109/L in the oseltamivir group and 58.17 \u00b1 32.99 \u00d7 109/L in the control group on the fourth day after the initiation of oseltamivir treatment (P = 0.031). From day 4 through day 9, the difference continued to be statistically significant between the groups, and on the 10th day, platelet counts were 198.8 \u00b1 82.6 \u00d7 109/L in the oseltamivir group and 147.7 \u00b1 81.78 \u00d7 109/L in the control group (P = 0.684). The amount of platelets transfused decreased significantly in the oseltamivir group (0.676 \u00b1 1.36 apheresis units) compared to the control group (1.35 \u00b1 1.98 apheresis units; P = 0.044; Table 3). The data indicated that oseltamivir could shorten the platelet recovery time and reduce platelet transfusion quantity. No special adverse events during the oseltamivir therapy were observed (Additional file 1: Table S5). The platelet desialylation levels were analyzed in 25 patients after oseltamivir therapy. The sWGA FITC-labeled lectins declined significantly compared to those before treatment. However, neither RCA-I nor ECL FITC-labeled lectins showed significant change after oseltamivir treatment (Additional file 1: Figure S4).\n",

Organ dysfunction can be identified as an acute change in the total SOFA score \u22652 consequent to the infection. The new definition of sepsis reflects an up-to-date view of pathobiology, particularly in regards to what distinguishes sepsis from uncomplicated infection [37]. Although our study was initiated in 2014, at which point the diagnostic criteria for sepsis was based on the Surviving Sepsis Campaign guidelines (Sepsis-2), 253 of the 261 sepsis patients included had SOFA scores \u22652. Thus, even by the more \u201cstrict\u201d criteria of Sepsis-3, most patients had sepsis involving organ dysfunction rather than an infection plus an accompanying inflammatory response alone.",

Moreover, an exponential correlation was showed between the shortening of platelet life span in the circulation and the content of sialic acid removed by neuraminidases in vitro [39]. In addition, direct injection of neuraminidases to mammals markedly accelerated the clearance and shorted the life span of platelets [40, 41].
