The \u201cadvancements\u201d of the human race\u2014increased urbanization, global travel, changes in land use, and fervent exploitation of the nature\u2014are also the prime reasons for zoonosis and emergence of novel infectious diseases such as above (Madhav et al. 2017; Ahmed et al. 2019). This rapid emergence of novel infectious diseases transmitting from surrounding animal life to humans and then from human to human, traveling quickly across the globe can trigger worldwide public health emergency situations, as prevalent today (https://www.who.int/dg/speeches/detail/who-director-general-s-opening-remarks-at-the-media-briefing-on-covid-19-11March2020, http://www.emro.who.int/fr/about-who/rc61/zoonotic-diseases.html).

Pandemic preparation is not a job of single individual or organization. It requires inputs from each person susceptible to the infection agent as well as policy makers at national and international levels, frontline healthcare providers, infrastructure developers and maintenance personnel, pharmaceutical industry and researcher community, and so forth. Moreover, the pandemic preparedness plan needs constant reviewing and improvisation (https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/seasonal-influenza/preparedness/why-pandemic-preparedness). In line with the magnitude of the COVID-19 pandemic, worldwide action plans have been activated on national and international levels. The United Nations\u2019 Strategic Preparedness and Response Plan (SPRS) Against COVID-19, in layman terms, is designed to control human\u2013human transmission, preventing outbreaks and delaying spread; provide optimal care for all patients; and minimize the impact on healthcare systems and socioeconomic activities. Under SPRS each nation is assessed for risk and vulnerability, and the resource requirements to support the country to prepare for and respond to COVID-19 are estimated. Several nations are well placed to implement this action plan with minimal support. However, otherwise partners are to be introduced to facilitate implementation of measures where there is a gap in capacity, on either a national or a subnational level, in additional support to national governments. Thus, an extensive analysis and identification of an affected nation\u2019s gaps and needs shall be the basis to develop a COVID-19 Country Preparedness and Response Plan (CPRP). These CPRPs will need constant monitoring and reviewing using indicators charted in the SPRP and updated as the situation evolves (https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/covid-19-sprp-unct-guidelines.pdf).",

Notably, these are predictive techniques applicable to each of the three facets of disease surveillance (Siettos and Russo 2013). A classical epidemiological surveillance parameter is quantitation of R\n0 (R nought, basic reproductive number) using mathematical models (https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/25/1/17-1901_article). R\n0 is a crucial metric indicating that on average the number of new infection cases are generated by a confirmed infection case, i.e., the potential transmissibility of an infectious disease. R\n0 of COVID-19 infection is estimated as 2\u20133.5 in the early phase, as even the asymptomatic patients or with mild pneumonia extruded large amounts of virus (Wang et al. 2020). Important characteristics of R\n0 are:It is a dynamic number and changes withEach stage of the diseaseWith interventions, e.g., vaccination, antiviralsPrecautionary measures such as personal/community disinfection, social distancing, and travel restrictions\nWith the knowledge of R\n0, one can predict:New cases expected on a daily basis, and hence facilitate arrangement of healthcare services and interventions locallyOutbreak size and the dates of peak infection of the pandemicProbable decline timelineThe extent of vaccination coverage required to prevent future outbreaks\nAn R\n0 > 1 indicates that each infected individual is transmitting the disease to more than 1 new individual, and the infection is spreading increasingly. R\n0 = 1 indicates stable transmission and R\n0 < 1 indicates the decline in disease transmission (Fig. 14.1). The aim of pandemic action plans is to monitor and depreciate the R\n0.\n\n\n",

This model estimates the size of epidemic in Wuhan between December 2019 and January 2020 and forecasts the extent of domestic and global public health risks of taking into account for social and non-pharmaceutical prevention interventions. It is a compartmental model comprising four compartments and the individuals comprising the sample population move through each compartment\u2014\u201cSusceptible\u201d (not immune to infection) and get infected from other infection individuals and move to the \u201cExposed\u201d compartment for the incubation period. Hereafter the infectious individuals move to the \u201cInfected\u201d compartment and eventually to the \u201cRecovered\u201d compartment after the disease has run its course, and they now have some immunity (Fig. 14.2). The changes in the population in each compartment are estimated using ordinary differential equations to simulate the progression of an infectious disease. The critical parameters associated with this model are:Force of infection (\u03bb) is the rate at which susceptible individuals are exposed. It depends on the transmission rate (\u03b2).Incubation rate (E) is the rate at which exposed people become infectious.Recovery rate (\u03b3) is the rate at which infected individuals recover from the infection.\n\n",

AI, data analytics, and technological support amalgamated to facilitate:Track and forecast community outbreaks:BlueDot is a Canadian AI company using natural language processing and machine learning algorithms to monitor news outlets, worldwide official healthcare reports in several different languages, and air-travel data and flag the mention of contagious or novel diseases such as coronavirus. Importantly this is followed by scrutiny by epidemiologists and thus also has a component of human analytics. BlueDot alerted its clients to the potential outbreak in Wuhan, China, on December 30, 2019, 9 days prior to the WHO recognized it as an epidemic (https://bluedot.global/products/).Disease diagnosis and verification of infected individuals:Chest computed tomography (CT) scans have been endorsed as a primary diagnostic tool for COVID-19 (Ai et al. 2020). Ali-baba group\u2019s research academy has developed a deep-learning AI-enabled system that can diagnose COVID-19 in 20 s with 96% accuracy and hence possibly automate the diagnosis activity in the face of overburdened healthcare systems. The AI system identifies an infectious individual based on the chest CT scans. The algorithm has been trained with data and CT scans from nearly 5000 confirmed coronavirus cases from across China. It can be used to track the efficacy of treatment during the course of infection as well as rapidly diagnose COVID-19 (https://www.alizila.com/how-damo-academys-ai-system-detects-coronavirus-cases/).Implementing public hygiene guidelines:Risk communication in places of potential communication is critical to alert the public and implement mass hygiene measures such as use of sanitizers and face masks when in public places. Google Trends was used in Taiwan to monitor the public risk awareness following the first imported case of COVID-19 which correlated with the increased search keywords \u201cCOVID-19\u201d and \u201cface masks.\u201d Moreover, search for \u201chandwashing\u201d increased coinciding with the face mask shortage. High to moderate correlations between Google relative search volume and COVID-19 cases were evident in several major cities of Taiwan (Husnayain et al. 2020). Similarly, in China an AI-based company SenseTime has developed a \u201cSmart AI Epidemic Prevention Solutions\u201d\u2014a quick and effective system based on facial recognition and thermal imaging to screen for individuals with fever in a crowd without physical contact and hence preventing transmission. It can also monitor if any individual is wearing a face mask or violating the quarantine rules (https://www.sensetime.com/en/news/view/id/140.html).Contact tracing:Health Code, a Chinese government monitoring system, for which users can sign up through Alipay or WeChat, assigns individuals a color code (red\u201414 days self-quarantine/yellow\u20147 days self-quarantine/green\u2014free movement) based on their travel history, time spent in outbreak hotspots and exposure to potential carriers of the virus. The software can be used to check the color of an individual on entering their identity numbers.Characterization of the CoV-2 and vaccine/therapy development:The Genome Detective Coronavirus Typing Tool is a web-based, user-friendly software application that can identify the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) sequences isolated in the original outbreak in China and later around the world. The tool accepts 2000 sequences per submission, analyzing them in approximately 1 min. This tool facilitates tracking of new viral mutations as the outbreak expands globally, which may help to accelerate the development of novel diagnostics, drugs, and vaccines to stop the COVID-19 disease (Cleemput et al. 2020).Google\u2019s AI platform DeepMind-based protein structure prediction tool AlphaFold has predicted and released the 3D structures of several understudied proteins of the CoV-2 as an open source. These can be useful in designing antivirals/vaccines against COVID-19 in future outbreaks (Jumper et al. 2020).\n",

By mid-January, the first RT-PCR assays for COVID-19 were accessible in Hubei. The viral sequences and PCR primers and probe sequences were open-sourced and uploaded to public platforms by the Centre for Disease Control, China. By February, there were ten kits for the detection of COVID-19 approved in China by the National Medical Products Association\u2014six were RT-PCR kits, one isothermal amplification kit, one virus sequencing product, and two colloidal gold antibody detection kits (https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf). As of today, when the disease has assumed pandemic proportions, the volume of diagnostic tools needs to be multiplied, and hence, the United States Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) has provided regulatory relief to several testing companies like ThermoFisher, Hologic, and LabCorp under the Emergency Use Authorizations, to facilitate ease of diagnosis. Also it is keeping a tight watch on fraudulent companies claiming to sell interventions against COVID-19 (https://www.fda.gov/emergency-preparedness-and-response/mcm-issues/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19). Moreover, the world\u2019s first CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)-based diagnostic kit has been developed for COVID-19 by Mammoth Biosciences, USA, and University of California. Notably, the diagnostic kit is a simple strip-based assay and is easy to use and allows rapid detection without the need of transporting samples over long distances.

However, in pandemic scenarios of new infectious diseases such as COVID-19, vaccine supplies will be limited or nonexistent at the early phase in lieu of the novelty of the disease and the unpredictability of the pandemic occurrence. Thus, vaccines cannot be stockpiled, and production can only start once the novel virus has been recognized. With the current state-of the-art, the first doses of vaccine are not likely to become available in the early months of the pandemic. However, the pandemic action plans have accounted for forward planning to increase the likelihood that the vaccine will progressively become available as the pandemic unfolds. Importantly, national or regional priorities need to be fixed in the action plan for the rational use of the building/limited supply of the novel vaccine. Also, production and use of vaccines during the inter-pandemic period will influence their availability during a pandemic. Thus, improving the infrastructure and logistics for vaccine production, administration, cold-chain, and professional training with the novel vaccines are important to avert/cruise through future outbreak events. The WHO advisory on prioritizing the population groups are as enlisted in descending order. However, the priorities need tailoring in each country/region according to local needs and epidemiological circumstances.",

Several drugs such as chloroquine, arbidol, remdesivir, and favipiravir are currently undergoing clinical studies to establish their efficacy and safety against COVID-19. It is important to establish a regular supply chain of antivirals and a high surge capacity in the face of CoV-2 pandemic and future outbreaks. Antivirals have a significant impact in reducing morbidity and mortality in light of unlikelihood of availability of vaccine against in early phases of pandemic. It is important to evaluate the non-interference of the antiviral interventions with the eventual vaccination, as well as the epidemiology of the group of individuals most seriously affected. It is also advisable to make available the information about the performance characteristics, side effects, and costs of antiviral therapy to public. Also the commonly used neuraminidase inhibitors in influenza pandemics are ineffective in the case of CoV-2 mediated infection and outbreaks (Pang et al. 2020; Dong et al. 2020a, https://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/influenza/11_29_01_A.pdf). The incorporation of antiviral therapy can be categorized as a prophylactic and for treatment use. As with vaccines, prioritizing of groups for antiviral therapy is advised as follows:Essential service providers, including healthcare workers (prophylaxis or treatment). Especially, healthcare providers are in a position to be in direct contact with infectious individuals and are thus entitled to priority antiviral therapy. Other community services such as those responsible for vaccine manufacture and delivery and personnel responsible for enforcing law and order and public safety.Groups at high risk of death and severe complications requiring hospitalization. The goal of prophylaxis or treatment here is to rein the mortality and morbidity. Thus, high-risk persons living in the community outbreaks, seriously ill hospitalized patients, patients for whom a potential CoV-2 vaccination is contraindicated are prioritized.Persons without known risk factors for complications from COVID-19. Here the approach is generally therapeutic and aims to rein the morbidity and rationalize the use of healthcare resources such as antibiotics. Though, the logistics of this strategy are extensive and expensive (requires large quantities of antivirals and access to healthcare service providers), it is most likely to limit the economic and social destabilization associated with a pandemic (Monto 2006; Henry 2019, https://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/influenza/11_29_01_A.pdf).\n",

Social distancing combined with case isolation and contact tracing has demonstrated its effectiveness in controlling the transmission from imported infection cases to the community transmission scenario (Wilder-Smith and Freedman 2020). The relevance of case isolation and contact tracing are highlighted in a study by Hu and coworkers where they have performed a clinical characterization of 24 asymptomatic patients\u2014confirming infection by a laboratory-confirmed positive for the COVID-19 virus nucleic acid from pharyngeal swab samples. The asymptomatic cases did not present any obvious symptoms while nucleic acid screening. About 20.8% developed classical symptoms of fever, cough, and fatigue, during hospitalization; 50.0% presented CT images of ground-glass chest and 20.8% presented stripe shadowing in the lungs; 29.2% cases presented normal CT image and had no symptoms during hospitalization, comprising the younger subset (median age: 14.0 years). None developed severe COVID-19 pneumonia, and no mortality was observed. However, epidemiological investigation indicated at typical asymptomatic transmission to the cohabiting family members, which even caused severe COVID-19 pneumonia. This study puts a spotlight on close contact tracing and longitudinally surveillance via virus nucleic acid tests. Case isolation and continuous nucleic acid tests are also recommended (Hu et al. 2020). De-isolating of suspect cases where the first confirmatory test has returned negative is also an emerging issue of concern and needs improvement in testing capacity as well as strict implementation of social distancing during pandemic scenarios (Tay et al. 2020).",

Especially, if local myths and rumors are circulated in the already home-quarantined population, restriction in fear of the disease can lead to additional mass hysteria. Thus it is important to create awareness and dispel any negative myth, as put forth by the WHO in context of CoV-2 (https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/advice-for-public/myth-busters). Some myths dispelled are:COVID-19 virus can be transmitted in areas with hot and humid climates or cold and snowy climates. CoV-2 can be transmitted in all areas.Hot bath cannot prevent CoV-2 transmission.CoV-2 is not transmitted by mosquito bites. It is a respiratory illness and respiratory hygiene is a key protective strategy.Heat generated from hand dryers is not effective against killing CoV-2 on your hands. The only way to disinfect hands is washing with soap-water or alcohol-based sanitizers.Thermal scanners are effective in detecting only the elevated body temperatures. A confirmatory nucleic acid test is the most guaranteed test.All age groups can be infected by CoV-2. Elderly people and people with pre-existing medical conditions\u2014asthma, diabetes, cardiovascular disease\u2014 are more vulnerable to exhibit severe COVID-19. Thus, WHO advises people from all age groups to protect themselves by implementing good hand hygiene and respiratory hygiene.SARS-CoV-2 is not a bioengineered organism arising out of manipulations from earlier SARS-CoV. Andersen and coworkers have analyzed the genome sequence of the novel coronavirus-2 and compared it with several other zoonotic viruses. They claim that the viral\u2013human point of contact\u2014the high affinity receptor binding domain of CoV-2 binding with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) of the target host\u2014is acquired through natural selection. Also they have shed light of probable animal host being Rhinolophus affinis, as another virus RaTG13, sampled from a bat, is ~96% identical overall to CoV-2 (https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0820-9).\n",

If we trace the economic trajectory of a pandemic:Early phase measures to contain/limit outbreak\u2014shutting down of workplaces and public businesses, mobilization of healthcare supplies and surveillance activities, contact tracing, social distancing by isolation of contacts/quarantines incur significant human resource and staffing costs (Achonu et al. 2005).As the scale of the epidemic expands, new medical infrastructure will need to be constructed to manage building number of confirmed infected individuals, the surge in demand for medical consumables can increase the health system expenditures (Herstein et al. 2016).The quarantine and lockdown impositions disrupt trans-national supply chains, transportation industry, agriculture, entertainment, and travel industry. Hoarding and black marketing of essential and medical commodities are expected.Behavioral changes during pandemic\u2014avoiding association with other people to avoid infection\u2014are the major determinant for economic impact of pandemics (Fig. 14.5) and not mortality. The behavioral change fear driven which in turn is driven by awareness and ignorance (Burns et al. 2008).National and international relief funds have been constituted to mitigate the world through the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, the SPRP estimates a funding support of nearly US$675 million for key response efforts against COVID-19 in countries most in need of help through April 2020. A first-of-its-kind COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund was constituted for arranging for funding support through individual and organizational donations on March 13, 2020. The COVID-19 Solidarity Response Fund is hosted by two foundations, the UN Foundation (registered in the United States) and the Swiss Philanthropy Foundation (registered in Switzerland) in association with the WHO (https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/donate).Increased fiscal distress due to decrease in tax revenues and increased expenditures are expected in low middle-income countries, where fiscal framework is weak. This situation aroused earlier in West Africa Ebola epidemic in Liberia: response costs surged, economic activity slowed, and quarantines and curfews compromised government capacity to collect revenue (https://www.worldbank.org/content/dam/Worldbank/document/HDN/Health/WDR14_bp_Pandemic_Risk_Jonas.pdf).The high-income countries in scenario of a moderate pandemic can offset fiscal distress by providing official development assistance to affected countries and budgetary support. However, during a severe pandemic, a high-income country will also confront the same fiscal stresses and may be unwilling to provide assistance.\n\n",
