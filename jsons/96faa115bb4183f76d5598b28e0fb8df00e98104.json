We simulate a scenario in which a lockdown is first imposed on a population and then partly lifted while longrange transmission is kept at a minimum. Simulated spreading patterns resemble contemporary distributions of Covid-19 across nations, regions, and provinces, providing some model validation. Results suggest that the proposed strategy may significantly flatten a second wave. We also find that post-lockdown flare-ups remain local longer, aiding geographical containment. Public policy may target long ties by heavily focusing medical testing and mobility tracking efforts on traffic and transport. This policy can be communicated to the general public as a simple and reasonable principle: Stay nearby or get checked.",

The relative sparsity of longrange ties may make tight control feasible through a focus of resources on a small number of key individuals or interactions.",

Network analysis was introduced into mainstream epidemiology at the turn of the century to explicitly incorporate the contact structure among individuals. It is well known that diffusion processes on networks depend on the corresponding connectivity patterns [14] . Research has shown that subtle features of network structure can have a major impact on the outcome of an epidemic [15, 16] . Small-world networks are almost identical to lattice networks in which viruses spread slowly and locally [13, 17] . The subtle difference is a small portion of ties to distant localities on the lattice, producing a dramatic reduction in a network's diameter, which is inversely related to viral spread. The rapid spread of viruses through small-world networks makes them hard to contain in time within confined regions of a population. Past work has examined the effects of a range of network models on epidemiological dynamics [18] [19] [20] .",

In a study closest to ours, Small and Tse investigate disease spread in a small-world network with separate infection probabilities for short-distance and long-distance ties [22] . Using a SEIR model of the SARS epidemic dynamics they find that exponential growth in infection occurs upon onset of several non-local infections. They conclude that key to capturing the empirically observed transmission dynamics is differentiating local from nonlocal transmission probabilities. We build on this observation to explore the leverage that the targeting of Covid-19 post-lockdown policies at reductions of non-local transmission may provide to global, national, or regional policy makers.",

How can a second wave be minimized while at the same time preventing enormous economic costs? It is well known that when a lockdown is lifted, a virus tends to re-appear [24] . Therefore it is of paramount importance to find ways to regain some form of normal life (alleviating lockdown) while at the same time preventing the virus from going viral again. The main idea proposed here is that restricting certain high-risk interactions within the social network may be a better strategy than to restrict those of an entire population. 'Long-distance' ties represent interaction between individuals that are distant to each other in a network. Typically this means they are also physically distant, i.e. think of a truck driver that delivers goods to a company on the other side of the country or individuals traveling by plane that encounter each other at airports and in airplanes where social distancing is difficult or next to impossible. Small-world models suggest that long-distance ties greatly accelerate the speed of transmission. Long-range ties stemming from infected individuals allow disease to start spreading in distant other localities and much more often lead to not-yet-infected individuals and regions. At a global level, long ties predominantly involve international highways and airline transportation. Topological properties of airline transportation networks can explain patterns in viral disease spread worldwide [12, 25] . At a national level, long ties pertain to mobility through major roads and trains between cities and at a regional level to commuting and local delivery services.",

The lockdown is modeled as a global intervention that reduces on day 25 the per-contact probability of disease transmission, r long = r short = 0.01. A second, targeted intervention occurs on day 100, when per-contact transmission through short-range ties goes back to normal, r short = 0.1, but transmission through long-range ties, r long , remains limited to a degree that we systematically vary. We also study a version where r short on day 100 is set at 0.05, reflecting maintenance of some forms of social distancing after lockdown. We thus model a scenario in which policy makers rely heavily or entirely on longrange transmission blockage to reduce the second wave of Covid-19 infections.",

Figure 2 shows the spatial distribution of Covid-19 cases on April 6, 2020 at three scales: countries, regions in Italy, and provinces in Italy (Source: gisanddata.maps.arcgis.com). Figure 2 also shows the spatial distribution of Covid-19 spread in our model after 50 days, 25 days into lockdown. To this end we arbitrarily divided the ring lattice of n = 10,000 nodes into 100 regions of 100 nodes each. Both empirical observations and simulations appear a good fit to the exponential distribution, with standard deviation roughly equal to the mean. Figure 3a varies the per-contact transmission probability r long after the lockdown on local ties is entirely lifted. When restrictions on long ties are also lifted so that r long goes back to its original level of 0.1, the peak of the second wave vastly exceeds that of the first wave. Reductions in r long flatten the curve. At r long = 0, the second curve is only modestly higher than the first, even though at p = 0.1 90 percent of all ties are fully active. Figure 3b shows that comparable effects of suppressing long tie transmission are obtained when lockdown release is delayed by another 25 days. Figure 3c studies the same scenario except that at day 100 r short is kept at 0.05 (e.g. some social distancing measures are left in place). Without further restrictions on long-range ties, r long = 0.05, a sizeable second peak occurs. With r long reduced, the curve is substantially flattened and at maximal suppression of long ties, the second peak is lower than the first. Note that the blue peak in figure 3c, where r short = 0.05, is only mildly lower than the blue peak in figure  3a , where r short = 0.10. In other words, reducing transmission in short ties is much less effective than in long ties, even though the former are much greater in number. Figure 3d shows that when a partial lockdown release is delayed by another 25 days, effects of suppressing long tie transmission are comparable.",

What policies could constrain long-range transmission? Medical testing and mobility-tracking apps may be targeted specifically at transport, travel, and delivery. Perhaps medical testing and / or mobility tracking should be encouraged or required for flight, use of highways, trains, regional bus lines and for individuals with jobs in the transport and delivery sector. Self-isolation after exposure of such individuals may perhaps be more stringently enforced. What helps is that long-range ties are relatively sparse, so resources may be focused on a limited number of individuals or activities. That said, our result show that effects are particularly strong when transmission through long-range ties is not just reduced but largely eliminated. The logistical, technological and ethical challenges of geographic targeting in location tracking, testing, and police enforcement require further interdisciplinary study.",
