As of April 29, 2020, COVID-19 has claimed more than 200,000 lives, with a global mortality rate of~7% and recovery rate of~30%. Understanding the interaction of cellular targets to the SARS-CoV2 infection is crucial for therapeutic development. Therefore, the aim of this study was to perform a comparative analysis of transcriptomic signatures of infection of COVID-19 compared to different respiratory viruses (Ebola, H1N1, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV), to determine unique anti-COVID1-19 gene signature. We identified for the first time molecular pathways for Heparin-binding, RAGE, miRNA, and PLA2 inhibitors, to be associated with SARS-CoV2 infection. The NRCAM and SAA2 that are involved in severe inflammatory response, and FGF1 and FOXO1genes, which are associated with immune regulation, were found to be associated with a cellular gene response to COVID-19 infection. Moreover, several cytokines, most significantly the IL-8, IL-6, demonstrated key associations with COVID-19 infection. Interestingly, the only response gene that was shared between the five viral infections was SERPINB1. The PPI study sheds light on genes with high interaction activity that COVID-19 shares with other viral infections. The findings showed that the genetic pathways associated with Rheumatoid arthritis, AGE-RAGE signaling system, Malaria, Hepatitis B, and Influenza A were of high significance. We found that the virogenomic transcriptome of infection, gene modulation of host antiviral responses, and GO terms of both COVID-19 and Ebola are more similar compared to SARS, H1N1, and MERS. This work compares the virogenomic signatures of highly pathogenic viruses and provides valid targets for potential therapy against COVID-19.",

The most common indicator of radiological detection was the bilateral ground-glass or patchy opacity. Some of the patients had lymphopenia and eosinopenia. Blood eosinophil levels positively correlates with the lymphocyte levels following hospital admission in severe and non-severe patients. Severe patients were associated with substantially higher levels of D-dimer, C-reactive protein, and procalcitonin relative to nonsevere patients . A typical biological response for the different viral infections may be identified, whereas some particular genes are dysregulated during the infection with specific viruses. Such response may have a major impact on the ability of the host to mount an adaptive host response. For instance, both MERS and SARS-CoV induced a similar activation of pattern recognition receptors and the interleukin 17 (IL-17) pathway (Josset et al. 2013) .",

We found 173 DEGs are unique to COVID-19 (Figure 3 and Table S3 ). Of these genes, SAA2 was the most significant (-10logp-value of 81) ( Table S2 ). GO analysis demonstrated that certain genes, such as CSF3, CSF2, IL1B, and PTGS2, are linked to the IL-17 signaling pathway, cytokine signaling in the Immune system, and have been reported in the host response to Rhinovirus infection ( Figure S1 ). Overall, the terms of the biologic process, such as keratinocyte / epithelial cell differentiation, organ development, cell component movement and cell death, are very significant among these genes (Table S4) , whereas molecular function such as RAGE receptor binding, cytokine activity, and metal ion binding are highly recognized (Table S4 ). Table S3 ). Among the Ebola-shared TNIP1, ICAM1, and CFB genes were highly associated with COVID-19 (-10logpvalue > 40), while genes such as TLR2, FOXO1, and MYC were highly associated with cytokine response and cell death ( Figure S2 and Table S2 ). The GO molecular terms of these genes highlighted the biological functions of phospholipase inhibitor activity (including phospholipase A2), and heparin binding (including glycosaminoglycan). While biological processes such as cell surface receptor signaling pathways and cell death are highly significant ( Table   S4 ). The MERS-CoV-shared genes KRT6B and TNFAIP3 have a high p-value associated with COVID-19, whereas genes such as OAS1-3, IRF9, IRF7, STAT1, PML and IFIH1 are highly associated with host responses to viral infection and type I interferon ( Figure S3 ). Biological processes related to virus response, Type I interferon signaling and the cytokine-mediated signaling pathway are highly redundant. While the biological functions of 2-5-oligoadenylate synthetase activity, double-stranded RNA binding, adenyltransferase activity, metal ion binding and related to growth activity, such as epidermal growth, are quite significant (Table S4) . COVID-19, Ebola, and MERS-CoV share uniquely 31 genes, of which BIRC3, MX1, and IL8 are strongly linked to COVID-19 (-logpvalue 23, 37, and 105, respectively) (Figure 3 , Table S2 and Table S3 ). Among these genes, DDX58 and IFIT1 are highly associated with cytokine response, NF-kappa B signaling pathway, and immune response to virus infection ( Figure S4 ).",

SAA2 is an inflammation factor that has demonstrated its effectiveness as a sensitive indicator of clinical diagnosis ) . In addition, we have observed the uniqueness of the SAA2 gene expression in the COVID-19 infection relative to SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, Ebola, and H1N1 viral infections (Figure 3 and Table S3 ), which indicates its role in host response. On the other hand, CCL20 gene has been related to lung carcinoma, where it controls proliferation and cell migration via the PI3 K pathway (Wang et al. 2016 ) . These mechanisms are among the most important in host defense. Multiple genes belong to the interleukin gene family were identified in this study, such as IL6, CXCL1, 3 and 5, and the IL-17 which have a significant association with the host response of COVID-19 (Figure 1 and Table S2 ).

The triggering and upregulation of RAGE by its ligands correlate with increased survival rates (Sparvero et al. 2009 ). Additionally, RAGE has a secretory isoform that can have an independent causative effect on community-acquired pneumonia, such as pandemic influenza (H1N1) (Narvaez-Rivera et al. 2012).

            "text": "Among the five viral infections, we found that GO terms were mostly enriched between COVID-19 and Ebola (Figure 4 and Table S3 ). Such overlap suggested certain genes and gene families, which could explain the aggressiveness of COVID-19 infections. Within these GO enriched pathways, the TNIP1, ICAM1, and CFB were most significantly associated with COVID-19 (logpvalue > 40) (Figure 1 and Table S2 ). The TNIP1 gene encodes the A20-binding protein that plays a role in autoimmunity and tissue homeostasis by controlling the activation of the kappa-B nuclear factor (Bowes et al. 2011) . TNIP1 reduction sensitizes keratinocytes to post-receptor signaling after interaction to TLR agonists and has the ability to activate immune cells and induce inflammation (Kaczanowska et al. 2013) . The correlation between TNP1 and COVID-19 (Figure 1 and Table S2) could be due to its role in suppressing NF-kB pathway and therefore regulating the overexpression of viral proteins (Nimmerjahn et al. 2004 ) (Ramirez, Gurevich, and Aneskievich 2012) . The ICAM-1 intercellular adhesion molecule plays a major role in the infectivity and neutralization of the HIV-I and controls the survival of the influenza virus in lung epithelial cells during the early stages of infection (Othumpangat et al. 2016) . Forkhead Box O1 (FOXO1) is a transcription factor that plays an important role in the regulation of insulin signaling for gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis. There has been a strong relationship between FOXO1 and viral infections. The FOXO1 binds hepatitis B virus DNA and activates its transcription (Shlomai and Shaul 2009) . The FOXO1 reported to negatively regulate cellular antiviral response by promoting degradation of interferon regulatory transcription factor 3 (IRF3) (Lei et al. 2013 ) . In addition, it was reported that differentiation of CD8 memory T cells depends on FOXO1, where it plays an intrinsic role in the establishment of a post-effector memory program which is important for the formation of long-lived memory cells capable of immune reactivation (Michelini et al. 2013) .",

Our analysis identified several key aspects of host response to COVID-19 infection where essential immunity genes and biological pathways could be used for understanding the pathogenesis of COVID-19 infection. Common and specific genetic factors and pathways have been identified that characterize the immune pathology of COVID-19 infection. Our research outlined the relationship between Ebola's cellular host response and COVID-19, where many genes and GO words are enriched. Genes related to immune regulation, including FGF1 and FOXO1, and those associated with extreme inflammation, such as NRCAM and SAA2, have been closely associated with cellular response to COVID-19 infection. In addition, common interleukin family members, in particular IL-8, IL-6, demonstrated a special relationship with COVID-19 infection, indicating their key importance. The GO evaluation highlighted pathways for RAGE, miRNA and PLA2 inhibitors, which were first identified in this study as possible pathways highly associated with the host response to COVID-19 infection. Some of these pathways, such as PLA2 inhibitors, may hold the key for potential drugs to manage COVID-19 infections. The PPI study sheds light on genes with high interaction activity that COVID-19 shares with other viral infections, where the findings showed that the genetic pathways associated with Rheumatoid arthritis, AGE-RAGE signaling system, Malaria, Hepatitis B, and Influenza A were of high significance. Our work also shows that the combination of different types of experimental methods and parameters have been effective in studying the etiology of COVID-19 immunopathology compared to similar viral infections. In this regard, further research in this direction will be promising for characterizing new diagnostic biomarkers in the future or as surrogates for assessing the effectiveness of potential innovative therapies.",
