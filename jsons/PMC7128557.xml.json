One of the critical responses is the activation of the p53 tumor suppressor, which is the pivotal anticancer gene within the cell [3], [4]. p53 can induce or repress transcription and translation of a series of downstream genes, and further control cell cycle arrest and apoptosis [3], [4], [5]. These functions are important to repair DNA damage and to eliminate abnormal cells with DNA damage or deregulated proliferation, especially to modulate the activity of anticancer agents [6], [7], [8].",

Based on the previous models [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14] and stimulated by the impact of bioinformatics approaches on the biomedicine [15], a dynamic model of p53 stress response networks under continuous ion radiation (IR) at the cellular level is proposed along with the kinetics of double-strand breaks (DSBs) generation and repair, ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) activation, p53-MDM2 (murine double mimute2) feedback loop, as well as the toxins elimination module. Furthermore, the plausible outcomes of cellular responses were analyzed under different IR dose domains.",

Therefore, only the vital components and interactions are taken into account in the model. The scheme of the integrated model is given in Fig. 1\n. In the DSBs generation and repair module, acute IR induces DSBs stochastically and forms DSB\u2013protein complexes (DSBCs) at each of the damaged sites by interaction of the DSB with the DNA repair proteins (RPs). As a sensor of genome stress, ATM is activated by the DSBCs signal transferred from DSBs. ATM activation switches on or off the p53-MDM2 feedback loop, further regulating the downstream genes to control cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in response to genome stress [33], [34].",

Upon the activation by ATM\u2217, and decreased degradation by Mdm2, the total amount of p53 proteins increases quickly. Due to p53-dependent induction of Mdm2 transcription, the increase in Mdm2 proteins is sufficiently large to lower the p53 level, which in turn reduces the amount of the MDM2 proteins. The oscillation pulses shown in Fig. 5(c) have a period of about 400 min, the phase difference between p53 and MDM2 is about 100-min, moreover, the first pulse is slightly higher than the second, which is quite similar to the experimental observations [17], [18], [19] and the simulation results [7], [8], [9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14].",

In response to the input signal of ATM\u2217, the p53-Mdm2 module generates one or more oscillations. The response traces of the p53 protein under continuous applications of 2-, 6-, and 10-Gy IR from time zero are shown in Fig. 7\n(a), which shows that two or more pulses of p53 and MDM2 are generated after increasing the IR doses. Our simulations are fully in accordance with the observations that, on average, the greater the number of p53 pulses, the more severe the damage that can be triggered [8], [9], [33], whereas the intensity of the oscillations begins to decrease under 10-Gy IR. Meanwhile, Fig. 7(b) shows the kinetics of F\nw elimination induced by the degradation functions of p53\u2217, compared with Fig. 6(c), F\nw are eliminated dramatically and tends towards dynamic equilibrium versus radiation doses of 2- and 6-Gy IR, whereas F\nw begin to decrease at the first climax, and then maintain a higher level under continuous application of 10-Gy IR. These simulations suggest that p53\u2217 does play important roles in fighting against DNA damage, whereas the abilities of the cellular response to fight against genome stress begins to decrease as the IR dose overtakes a certain maximal threshold under different circumstances, such as in different cell types.",
