            "text": "Acute respiratory infections (ARIs) are a serious public health issue and rank among the top five causes of illness and hospitalization in children. During influenza seasons, fever and respiratory infection symptoms make up to 25% of all reasons for a visit to an Emergency Department (ED) (Silka 2003). Although ARIs can be caused by bacteria, they are most commonly caused by viral infections. A rapid diagnosis of a viral infection may lead to a decrease in the use of antibiotics, additional testing and possibly admissions. The most commonly implicated causal viruses are influenza (A and B), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human parainfluenza (1, 2 and 3), rhinovirus and adenovirus. These viruses account for 35 to 87% of children with an ARI. The variability in the range of positive viral diagnosis may be affected by the choice of viral tests used and their scope of viral detection (Jennings 2004; Weigl 2000). There is a risk of concurrent bacterial infection in children with a confirmed viral ARI. A study of children aged 3 to 36 months with recognizable viral infections showed a concurrent rate of bacteremia of 0.01 to 0.8% (Greens 1999). A prospective multicenter study of infants less than 60 days old with an ARI showed a significant difference in the rate of urinary tract infection between RSV positive (5.4%) and negative infants (10.1%), a non\u2010significant difference rate of bacteremia (1.1% and 2.3%) and no cases of bacterial meningitis among the 251 RSV positive infants and 8 cases out of 938 RSV negative infants (not statistically significant) (Levine 2004).",

            "text": "However, symptoms of viral ARI overlap with those of bacterial infections (such as pneumonia, bacteremia and meningitis) and in some cases, are difficult to distinguish. Without a confirmed viral diagnosis, medical assessment and diagnostic tests are often used before a decision on patient management, parental advice, and/or hospital admission are made. These precautionary tests lead to intense use of human health resources (nursing, laboratory and radiology staff) and hospital facilities. Furthermore, these tests are often invasive, sometimes unnecessarily prolonging a child's visit to the ED, resulting in sub\u2010optimal ED service provision and contributing to lengthy ED wait times and overcrowding.",

Studies comparing health care utilization for ARIs in children 0 to 15 years old during influenza season and the rest of the year showed significant excess in physician visits (28,000 to 51,000/100,000 age specific population annually), ED visits (\u02dc1600/100,000 age specific population annually), hospital admission (300 to 9500/100,000 age specific population annually) and antibiotic prescription (31,000/100,000 age specific population annually). Most of this burden came from children below three years of age (Menec 2003; Neuzil 2000).",

Up to 60% of patients with a common cold are treated with antimicrobials, which costs $37.5 million annually (Rosenstein 1998), despite most ARIs being caused by viruses. The physician and nursing costs only contributed to 17.5% of ARI management costs (Martin 2000). This suggests that extra investigations and antibiotic prescribing in the ED may be responsible for much of any unnecessary costs.",

This enabled rapid, informed patient management decisions and helped with triaging. This suggests a role for rapid viral diagnosis in alleviating the burden on EDs and improving health service delivery and health resource allocation, in the situation of increased use of EDs for ARI symptoms. A prompt viral diagnosis might improve decision\u2010making and reduces unnecessary hospital admittance, prescription of antibiotics, and further diagnostic investigations.",

            "text": "A number of rapid viral testing studies report subgroup analyses of participants with positive rapid viral results versus those with negative results. These demonstrated that a positive rapid viral diagnosis decreased the number of ancillary tests, antibiotics prescribed, and ED length of visits. While it is interesting to see that a positive result can decrease the amount of additional tests, the question is whether the rapid viral test is worth doing before one knows its result. As rapid viral diagnosis requires an invasive and uncomfortable test for the children (either through nasopharyngeal swabs or washings), it is important to determine how it may affect the outcome of the tested population as a whole. In the four studies mentioned above, the rate of positive viral diagnosis ranged from as low as 19% to 66% (19% to 52% for influenza testing alone and 66% for multi\u2010viral testing). Therefore, at least one\u2010third of the children received an invasive test that may not have altered the course of their work\u2010up or management. As one cannot definitively predict whether a child will have a positive test prior to doing it, this represents a large number of non\u2010helpful tests, which will actually add to the burden presented by children with febrile respiratory illnesses.
