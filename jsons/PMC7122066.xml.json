However, due to the continents unprecedented population growth, consumption and sale has risen to an unsustainable level that will result in the extinction of many species unless significant changes occur (Ape Alliance 1998; Chaber et al. 2010). The black rhinoceros ( ), western gorilla ( ), and African wild ass ( ) are examples of mammals that are now critically endangered due to illegal poaching (Red List 2015a; Red List 2015b; Red List 2015c). A report published by UNICEF (2014) highlights that over the next 35 years, Africa will double in population with over 1.8 billion new baby births, indicating this problem is only going to get worse, particularly with improving life expectancy.",

Within these countries, a variety of protein sources are readily available, yet consumers are willing to pay high prices in order to obtain bushmeat species native to their homeland. To make matters worse, the increased wealth of consumers means traders are willing to go to extreme lengths in order to export/import bushmeat due to the financial incentives available. Therefore, even the more resilient species may end up endangered, in order to supply this ever-growing demand (Chaber et al. 2010). The photograph (Fig. 12.1) below shows the remains of a giraffe slaughtered for bushmeat by two poachers, both of which were arrested (Big Life Foundation 2015). Tracker dogs are often used by bushrangers to hunt for traps, injured and dead animals, and poachers. Figure 12.2 is a photograph of the remains of wild animals loaded onto a truck, including a zebra caught in snares from poachers (Big Life Foundation 2015).\n\n",

The handling and preparation of infected wildlife is therefore one of the critical transmission routes that must be carefully controlled. Table 12.2 highlights examples of highly resistant diseases originated from wild animals, including those associated with bushmeat. The Bacillus anthracis spores , responsible for anthrax disease, are resistant to sterilization temperatures, drying, and many disinfectants. These spores can easily be spread by release in the air, which is why the US Military has viewed it as potential biological terrorism threat (Inglesby 1999; FDA 2015).\n\n",

Further to this, Conservation International Ghana found chemical poisoning to be the second most popular method of hunting in Ghana (Opare-Ankrah 2007).",

The kitchen preparation area was so bad that an emergency prohibition notice was issued due to an imminent risk of injury to human health (Pointing and Teinaz 2004). Figures 12.3, 12.4, and 12.5 were taken by Dr. Teinaz during the inspection for evidence in court. The store was closed down and unable to reopen until substantial improvements warranted re-inspection and approval. However, Paulina Owusu Pepra, the store owner, and her partner had reopened without approval. On 22nd October 2002, Dr. Teinaz returned with police and found meat products again being prepared and sold in similar unhygienic conditions (Pointing and Teinaz 2004). Police officers seized over 2 tons of rotten bushmeat including cane rat, giant snails that were decomposing in their own feces, pigs\u2019 feet, and a range of unidentified smoked meat, some with skin still attached. The owner, Paulina Owusu Pepra, appeared in court in December 2003 and was given a 3-month prison sentence and lifetime ban for preparing food for sale. Her husband, believed to have fled the country before sentencing, has not been found (Pointing and Teinaz 2004).\n\n\n",

However, the majority of the World including the UK and Europe do not fall within this poverty-stricken category. Is bushmeat therefore essential to people living within these countries? No. Are ethical considerations made when bushmeat is illegally imported, sold, and consumed? Probably not. Therefore, before the endangered become extinct, we need to decide on how to act for the future. Instead of buying products that remind us of where we have come from, should we not be thinking more ethically and buy products that allow us to sustain for the future before it is too late?",
