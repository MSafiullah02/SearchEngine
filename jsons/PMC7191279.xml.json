            "text": "Antenatal care services in Japan are designed to provide women with frequent face-to-face appointments for medical check-ups, screenings, education and psychological support (an average of 14 check-ups during pregnancy). To reduce the risk of infection, national policies have suggested eliminating nonessential hospital appointments and replacing them with remote support whenever feasible. Pregnant women are advised to refrain from seeking any maternity care if there are no specific concerns regarding the pregnancy. The pandemic has also forced hospitals and clinics to cancel most face-to-face antenatal classes, which means that midwives need to develop different pathways to prepare women for motherhood. Individual midwives have started creating online material to support pregnant women. For example, one midwife started a series of popular YouTube videos to guide mothers through the weeks before and after giving birth. In these videos, the midwife provides practical advice on early motherhood as well as psychological support by discussing the anticipated mental and physical changes. Some local authorities are joining these online efforts on their official pages by uploading videos on how to bathe a baby and how to prepare formula. Nevertheless, these are preliminary developments, and we are still working out the process to devise how best to provide tailored care remotely to meet the needs of individual pregnant women.",

            "text": "There are also clinical challenges during labour, birth and postpartum. Due to COVID-19, women are giving birth alone, without the presence of any family members. This is particularly challenging for Japanese women because hospital stays after giving birth are lengthier compared to most Western countries (five days for vaginal birth and seven days for caesarean birth). Because family presence and support are no longer permitted in hospital settings, our clinical colleagues have reported an increased level of anxiety and sense of isolation among both women and their families, especially in the case of caesarean birth, which requires a longer hospital stay. On the other hand, Japan needs to be ready for an overall increase in caesarean birth in the short term. The Japan Society of Obstetrics and Gynaecology has decided to address the concern of vertical transmission of COVID-19 from mother to baby with caesarean section, following recent reports regarding potential vertical transmission of the virus (Dong et al. 2020, Zeng et al. 2020). Postpartum maternity care has also been affected dramatically. Home visits have been stopped, and new mothers are particularly vulnerable to feeling isolated with inadequate support for themselves and their babies while navigating motherhood for the first time. A significant increase in enquiries regarding home birth with midwives to ensure family presence is reflective of these concerns.",

            "text": "It is also worth noting that Japan has a distinctive practice called satogaeri (\u91cc\u5e30\u308a) that has direct implications for maternity care. According to this custom, women return to their hometowns for delivery to secure support from the family of origin during and after birth. A woman registers with a clinic in her hometown some months prior to giving birth and relocates within the last month of pregnancy. This has become increasingly difficult with the travel restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Because of the risk of infection, women are either discouraged from relocating or advised to move far in advance of childbirth to allow sufficient time for home isolation in case of a potential infection. Many women have had to abandon their preferences for their place of birth and are losing their family support systems. Aside from the health risks for mothers and babies, health care services now need to adapt to meet the unforeseen change of circumstances for many planned deliveries.",

            "text": "Within the context of the pandemic, it is also worth noting the current situation of midwifery education in Japan. Unlike many European countries, midwifery students are not integrated into the national health care system while they are under training. In contrast with other Western countries, nursing and midwifery students are not allowed to support clinical work as a subsidiary member of medical staff or continue their clinical training during the COVID-19 pandemic. Training in clinical settings is currently on hold, with no prospect of when it can resume. Furthermore, the Japan Society of Reproductive Medicine recently made a recommendation to suspend the procedures of IVF due to concerns of the impact of possible infection on pregnancy. This could also directly affect midwifery education in the near future; when the students are allowed to resume their clinical practice, there will be a decrease in the number of births midwifery students can assist and learn from. This is particularly a challenge for academic institutions that heavily rely on their clinical practice in a hospital or clinic with a high proportion of pregnancies resulting from successful IVF. We need to look at different approaches to mitigate the impact on student midwives\u2019 education and clinical practice, and Japan should seek the best approach for trainee midwives under a national crisis such as the COVID-19 pandemic.",

Based on the current state of affairs, the main priorities for midwifery care in Japan are as follows:1Screen all pregnant women and their health care professionals.2Develop innovative systems for remote maternity care, including additional interventions for maternal support and anxiety management for women and their families. The Japan Midwives Association is taking the first steps toward remote midwifery support for pregnant and postpartum women on a national level.3Train all midwives on using technology and telecare platforms efficiently, such as using online video conferencing services such as Zoom to sustain antenatal care groups as well as health monitoring, education and supportive care for new mothers.4Adapt international guidelines to the specific needs of Japan, taking into consideration the particular structures of the Japanese health care system and maternity care, including cultural norms such as satogaeri.\n\n",
