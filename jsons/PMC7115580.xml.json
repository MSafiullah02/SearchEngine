The acute respiratory illnesses caused by these viruses represent major medical problems, given their significant morbidity and potential mortality, particularly in vulnerable populations such as small infants, elderly people or patients with underlying medical conditions [1]. Besides, the threat for new influenza A virus pandemics (such as that of 2009 [2]) is a reason for global and constant concern. Since the current arsenal of antiviral drugs to treat or prevent influenza or RSV infections is quite limited [1], [3], new therapeutics are highly needed. According to a recommendation by the World Health Organization [4], attention should be given to innovative agents with broad activity against diverse respiratory viruses.",

Most approved antiviral drugs target unique proteins encoded by one virus or a range of closely related viruses. This strategy is prone to selecting drug-resistance, particularly for viruses, which possess high mutability (such as influenza virus) or require long-term therapy. An alternative and relevant approach is to address host factors involved in the viral life cycle. This type of inhibitors is anticipated to possess a markedly higher barrier for selecting drug-resistant viruses and, furthermore, may display broad-spectrum antiviral activity when dealing with a cellular target that is recruited by different viruses. Two host-directed antiviral drugs are maraviroc, a CCR5 receptor antagonist approved for HIV therapy, and alisporivir, a cyclophylin inhibitor that is undergoing Phase III tests for hepatitis C treatment [5]. Specific host proteins were proven to be critical for the replication of diverse unrelated viruses [6], yet the array of possible cellular targets (the \u2018virus-host interactome\u2019) is continuously growing, as recently reviewed for influenza [7] and RSV [8].",

            "text": "The first example of a broadly-acting antiviral drug is ribavirin, a nucleoside analogue that was proposed to act directly at the level of the viral polymerase, although an indirect effect via inhibition of the host-cell IMP dehydrogenase and depletion of the GTP pool seems more plausible [9]. Another enzyme of the purine and pyrimidine pathways is dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) which catalyzes the reduction of dihydrofolate (DHF) to tetrahydrofolate (THF), a crucial cofactor for the biosynthesis of IMP and thymidylate. Folate antagonists interfering with DHFR can be applied in diverse pharmacological (i.e. antimalarial, antibacterial and antineoplastic) settings [10], [11], [12], [13]. The licensed antifolates trimethoprim [14], pyrimethamine [15] and cycloguanil are potent inhibitors of bacterial and protozoal DHFR, respectively, but only weak inhibitors of mammalian DHFR enzymes. On the other hand, the drug methotrexate (MTX) is a potent unselective DHFRs inhibitor (Ki = 0.01\u20130.2 nM) [16], because of its close structural similarity with dihydrofolic acid, the natural substrate of the enzyme [17]. MTX shows a binding affinity to human DHFR (hDHFR) 1000-fold higher than that of folic acid [16], explaining its clinical application as anticancer, anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive agent. Indeed, the MTX capability of affecting different intracellular pathways has been very recently described, highlighting a rather complex mechanism of action besides the most important therapeutic activity related to hDHFR inhibition [18]. Ongoing research efforts to develop novel antifolates for cancer chemotherapy and microbial infections continue to be extensively reviewed [19]. Cycloguanil is the active metabolite of the antimalarial drug proguanil (Paludrine\u00ae or Malarone\u00ae), that is approved for prophylaxis and treatment of infections by Plasmodium vivax or falciparum. The species-selective activity of cycloguanil (and pyrimethamine) has traditionally been attributed to higher affinity of the drug for Plasmodium bifunctional dihydrofolate reductase-thymidylate synthetase (DHFR-TS) than for hDHFR [20]. Since 1991, cycloguanil and related 1-aryl-4,6-diamino-1,2-dihydrotriazines were studied with the aim at treating Pneumocystis Carinii pneumonia [21], searching for more selective inhibitors for P. Carinii DHFR over host DHFR (especially human enzyme). Indeed, trimethoprim, the antifolate most widely used for that kind of infection, was a poor inhibitor of P. Carinii DHFR (Ki = 280 \u03bcM) and showed about 6-fold greater selectivity for hDHFR (Ki = 48 \u03bcM). Some 1-aryl-4,6-diamino-1,2-dihydrotriazines exhibited a selective P. Carinii DHFR inhibition, while cycloguanil and some related analogues (two of them corresponding to our compounds 11 and 14) were disclosed to bind slightly stronger to hDHFR (cycloguanil, Ki = 43.0 \u03bcM) than to P. Carinii enzyme (cycloguanil, Ki = 109.0 \u03bcM). Finally, the Author suggested that not only the expected selective fungal enzyme inhibitors, but even compounds with higher species-selectivity profile for hDHFR showed improvement over agents currently used to treat P. Carinii infections.",

As shown in Table 1, there was overall correlation between the antiviral EC50 values obtained by either method, indicating the reliability of the observed antiviral effect.

Based on this interesting observation, the study was oriented towards design and synthesis of more effective agents. Firstly, replacement of the chlorine atom in position 4 of the aromatic ring was explored: the introduction of either electron-withdrawing group isosteres of chlorine (F, 5; Br, 6) or electron-donor groups (CH3, 3; OCH3, 4) was permitted without changing the activity, whereas polar electron-withdrawing groups (NO2, COOH and COOEt: 7\u20139) were detrimental. Having assumed that chlorine is a well-suited substituent, we investigated its influence on the mono-substituted cycloguanil-related 2-Cl (10) and 3-Cl (11) isomers, and on the di-substituted 2,4-dichloro (15) and 3,4-dichloro derivatives (16). Compounds 11 and 16, bearing a lipophilic electron-withdrawing group in position 3 of the aromatic ring, proved to be strong inhibitors with sub-micromolar potency against influenza B virus (EC50 = 0.10 and 0.080 \u03bcM, respectively) and only 2-fold lower activity against influenza A viruses. In contrast, compound 10 was only poorly active against influenza B (EC50 = 56 \u03bcM), while the 2,4-dichloro substitution abolished the activity (15). Since these data clearly indicated that a lipophilic electron-withdrawing atom in position 3 properly modulates the antiviral activity, we next synthesized the 3-F (12), 3-Br (13) and 3-CF3 (14) analogues. Compound 14 showed an activity profile comparable to that of 11, whereas bromine derivative 13 was found to be the best influenza B inhibitor among the entire series, having an EC50 of 0.016 \u03bcM. In the next step, we varied the two methyl groups on C(2) of the 4,6-diamino-1,2-dihydrotriazine scaffold, by introducing bulkier alkyl groups than the two ones derived from acetone. This was achieved by performing condensation with methyl ethyl ketone (for 18), methyl isopropyl ketone (for 19), cyclopentanone (for 20\u201322), or cyclohexanone (for 23\u201325). The progressive increase in the substituent's size led to a proportional decrease in the activity against influenza A virus, while having much less impact for influenza B, even when combined with 3-Cl or 3-CF3 substitutions.",

Since most compounds were not cytotoxic at 100 \u03bcM (the highest concentration tested), the selectivity index, i.e. ratio of MCC to EC50, was calculated to be at least 10,000 for the most active analogues 11, 14 and 16. These compounds inhibited RSV replication at nanomolar concentrations, far surpassing the antiviral activity of ribavirin (EC50 = 5.8 \u03bcM, SI > 43). The latter is the only small molecule drug to treat RSV infections, but, as a consequence of its limited efficacy, the need of prolonged aerosol administration and the risk of toxicity, its use is limited to children at high risk [39]. Therefore, effective and safe drugs are strongly needed to treat severe RSV-linked respiratory pathologies which can also affect adults and, particularly, elderly. Thus, the highly potent compounds 11, 14 and 16 could be interesting lead compounds for further chemical derivatization and development of improved RSV inhibitors. Similar to what was observed for influenza virus, the drugs cycloguanil (1) and pyrimethamine (32) were found to be equipotent RSV-inhibitors with EC50 values of 0.55 and 0.75 \u03bcM, respectively, which is nearly one order of magnitude superior to the value of ribavirin.",

Intriguingly, the cytotoxicity of 14 was not affected, since the MCC value was 20 \u03bcM independent of whether dihydrofolic acid was present or not.

            "text": "This report describes the discovery of a new class of host-directed antiviral agents characterized by a 1-aryl-4,6-diamino-1,2-dihydrotriazine scaffold, responsible for a host (human) DHFR inhibition mechanism. Host-targeting antivirals represent an alternative and emerging strategy to address host factors involved in virus life cycle. This type of inhibitors could show a markedly higher barrier for selecting drug-resistant viruses and, furthermore, display broad-spectrum antiviral activity when interacting with a common cellular target that is recruited by different viruses. The interesting dual activity of the 1-aryl-4,6-diamino-1,2-dihydrotriazines against influenza and respiratory syncytial viruses, via inhibition of the cellular (human) DHFR enzyme, points to this host factor as a new therapeutic target for these two respiratory viruses. In fact, reversal effect on antiviral activity has been demonstrated in RSV-infected HeLa cells exposed to compound 14 in combination with different concentrations of dihydrofolic acid, such as natural DHFR substrate. The most promising compounds, tested against the recombinant protein of the hDHFR, also confirmed to bind this enzyme in the sub-micromolar range. Kinetic inhibition studies of cycloguanil showed a competitive inhibition behavior, and docking studies disclosed the most probable binding mode for this class of compounds as hDHFR ligands. Notably, the antiviral activity against RSV and influenza B viruses in cell-based assays, the Ki values on the recombinant hDHFR enzyme and, also the estimated binding affinity (\u0394G) shared an interesting comparable SAR trend.",

First, an inhibition assay at one concentration point (50 \u03bcM) has been performed in order to determine the best concentrations range to calculate the IC50 value. The inhibition assay was performed considering a final volume equal to 600 \u03bcL. In details, the several reagents were added in this following order: DDW, hDHFR enzyme at concentration of 0.36 \u03bcM, inhibitor compound at each single evaluated concentration, DHF substrate at concentration of 50 \u03bcM, TES buffer, and, at the end, NADPH was added to the reaction mixture, at concentration value equal to 120 \u03bcM, for starting the kinetic enzyme reaction.
