            "text": "In 2019/2020, the emergence of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) resulted in rapid increases in infection rates as well as patient mortality. Treatment options addressing COVID-19 included drug repurposing, investigational therapies such as remdesivir, and vaccine development. Combination therapy based on drug repurposing is among the most widely pursued of these efforts. Multi-drug regimens are traditionally designed by selecting drugs based on their mechanism of action. This is followed by dose-finding to achieve drug synergy. This approach is widely-used for drug development and repurposing. Realizing synergistic combinations, however, is a substantially different outcome compared to globally optimizing combination therapy, which realizes the best possible treatment outcome by a set of candidate therapies and doses toward a disease indication. To address this challenge, the results of Project IDentif.AI (Identifying Infectious Disease Combination Therapy with Artificial Intelligence) are reported. An AI-based platform is used to interrogate a massive 12 drug/dose parameter space, rapidly identifying actionable combination therapies that optimally inhibit A549 lung cell infection by vesicular stomatitis virus within three days of project start. Importantly, a sevenfold difference in efficacy is observed between the top-ranked combination being optimally and sub-optimally dosed, demonstrating the critical importance of ideal drug and dose identification. This platform is disease indication and disease mechanism-agnostic, and potentially applicable to the systematic N-of-1 and population-wide design of highly efficacious and tolerable clinical regimens. This work also discusses key factors ranging from healthcare economics to global health policy that may serve to drive the broader deployment of this platform to address COVID-19 and future pandemics. are inventors of pending and issued patents pertaining to artificial intelligence-based drug development and personalized medicine.",

            "text": "The discovery of COVID-19 has led to global panic and substantial challenges in rapidly and systematically identifying suitable interventions for this unpredictable disease. [1] Similar challenges have been associated with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), [2] H1N1, [3] H7N9, [4] Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), [5] and Ebola Virus Disease (EVD), [6] among others. When addressing infectious diseases that are not well understood, and capable of exhibiting aggressive clinical courses with subsequent patient mortality, rapid intervention that is optimally suited to target the pathogen is critical. Due to the unpredictability and severity of these pathogens, combination therapy based on drug repurposing is often indicated due to the urgency of intervention and the requirement of previously established drug safety in humans. Unfortunately, these drug combinations are often designed using trial-and-error strategies. Specifically, drugs are selected based on their targets or mechanism of action, and they are administered using clinical standard dosing guidelines. Dose adjustments are made when toxicity is observed. Unfortunately, these approaches likely preclude optimal treatment outcomes.",

[7] Substantial efforts have also been directed toward new drug development. When confronted with a novel pathogen strain with high virulence, a potential capacity for rapid and continuous mutation, and poor patient outcomes, the global community often requires rapidly actionable responses due to patient mortality that may quickly follow initial diagnosis. To address the COVID-19 crisis, a substantial number of clinical trials have been initiated. [8] Treatment options explored to address COVID-19 have included repurposed human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and influenza-related monotherapies and drug cocktails, trials of investigational therapies such as remdesivir (Gilead Sciences), and has sparked a worldwide effort to develop a vaccine. Among large sets of candidate therapies for drug repurposing in combination therapy, standard approaches involve drug selection based on mechanism of action. Drug dosing is subsequently determined by established clinical guidelines. Traditional design approaches are based on trial-and-error, and barriers include sub-optimal efficacy and dose-limiting toxicities. In sum, the lack of a systematic way to interrogate the massive drug-dose parameter space created by these pools of candidate therapies preclude the ability to optimize treatment outcomes.",

            "text": "To address this challenge, this work reports the outcomes of Project IDentif.AI, which harnesses an AI-based platform to interrogate drug and dose parameter spaces that are insurmountably large for brute-force testing of all possible combinations. Project IDentif.AI sought to determine the duration of time required to simultaneously identify the best drugs and doses from a pool of 12 candidate therapies that optimally inhibited the infection of the A549 lung cell line by VSV (efficacy) while maintaining A549 (efficacy). These therapies included amantadine HCl, dexamethasone, azithromycin, chloroquine diphosphate, naproxen sodium, fluoxetine HCl, loratadine, omeprazole sodium, ritonavir, lopinavir, doxycycline and ribavirin. The 12 candidate therapies were selected based on multiple factors that may be considered during pandemics, including prior studies examining their role as repurposed monotherapies in addressing a diverse range of viral pathogens, global adoption and availability of the therapies, as well as tolerability by broad classes of patients, among others. Specifically, Amantadine HCl is an organic compound that was developed to address influenza infections. [9] It has been repurposed for treatment of motor impairment in Parkinson's disease, [10] and explored for improvement of fatigue in patients with multiple sclerosis. [11] Dexamethasone is a potent anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressant glucocorticoid. It is used in therapies against a wide range of indications, including oncology and bacterial infections. [12] It has been successfully used to treat denguerelated hemophagocytic syndrome. [13] Azithromycin is an antibiotic given to patients with bacterial infections of lower respiratory tract, [14] including community-acquired pneumonia. [15] It has been explored as a novel antimalarial agent. [16] Chloroquine disphosphate is the most widely used drug against malaria. In recent years it has been found to target other infectious diseases, including HIV and fungal infections. [17] Naproxen sodium is an established nonselective, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) commonly used for treating mild and moderate pain and inflammation. [18] Recently, It has been shown to act against influenza A and B viruses. [19] Fluoxetine HCL, widely known as Prozac, is an antidepressant used to treat a range of depressive disorders. [20] Its antiviral properties have been explored for treating coxsackievirus. [21] Loratadine is a secondgeneration nonsedating antihistamine used for allergies. [22] Recent clinical trials have evaluated its use as abortive therapy in pegfilgrastim-associated bone pain. [23] Omeprazole sodium is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) used to treat gastrointestinal reflux disease and in Helicobacter pylori eradication therapy for gastritis and peptic ulcers. [24] Omeprazole and other PPIs have recently been investigated for and demonstrated antitumor activity and anti-inflammatory effects. [25] Ritonavir and lopinavir are antiretroviral medications commonly used in combination treatment for patients infected with (HIV), with ritonavir used as a booster with other protease inhibitors like lopinavir. [26] Lopinavir and ritonavir combination has demonstrated in vitro antiviral www.advancedsciencenews.com www.advtherap.com activity against SARS and favorable clinical response in patients with SARS. [27] Ritonavir has also been explored and shown to be highly effective as a booster in fixed-dose combinations for patients with Hepatitis C. [27] Doxycycline is a tetracycline antibiotic with a broad antimicrobial spectrum of activity. [28] In recent clinical trials, doxycycline has been shown to treat nasal polyps and rosacea, as an anti-inflammatory. [29] Ribavirin is an antiviral medication often administered in combination with interferon-based therapies for patients with chronic Hepatitis C. [30] Additionally, Ribavirin has been shown to be an effective treatment for respiratory syncytial virus and hemorrhagic fevers. [31] Within 3 days, our studies successfully identified and repeatedly validated multiple drug combinations that simultaneously reduced VSV infection to 1.5% with no apparent adverse impact on A549 viability. In addition, this platform identified multiple highly efficacious and tolerable regimens, presenting the potential of multiple options for treatment. This study demonstrated that Project IDentif.AI can potentially be used for patientspecific or population-wide development of actionable combination therapy. It's implementation also does not require complex disease mechanism or drug target information for implementation. This may enable its immediate application toward dynamically-optimized drug repurposing and novel combination therapy development against high priority pathogens such as COVID-19 and others.",

            "text": "The VSV model used for this study was encoded with green fluorescent protein (GFP) to monitor cell infection, with GFP intensity corresponding to viral infection efficiency. The GFP intensity of VSV-infected cells under different MOI parameters (0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1) were assessed. Cell densities for each well of 96 well plate varied between 4000 (4k), 8000 (8k) and 12 000 (12k) per well. Infection was allowed for 24 and 30 h (Figure 1A,B) . As indicated in the figure and microscopic images, MOI as low as 0.125 was sufficient to mediate nearly 100% cell infection after 24 h for 12k per well initial cell density.

Microscope images of bright field and fluorescence are merged for visualization under different MOI parameters (0.001, 0.01, 0.1) after VSV infection occurred for 12 h ( Figure 1C ) and 24 h ( Figure 1D ).

In lieu of using prior information pertaining to the synergistic affects among the 12 candidate drugs to identify suitable drug combinations, Project IDentif.AI harnessed a quadratic relationship between drug/dose inputs and efficacy/safety outputs to effectively identify the drug-dose parameter space from which the optimal drug combinations could be pinpointed, and drug synergy was identified after the optimization process was completed. Therefore, this process was agnostic to disease mechanism, as well as drug target information. The viral infection outcomes from each drug treatment were recorded at 12 and 24 h. For the purposes of evaluating the speed of optimization that would also yield experimentally validated VSV inhibition from a 12-drug set, a minimum threshold of 72 drug combinations with a broad range of corresponding dose levels were initially assessed (MOI = 0.1, Table S2 , Supporting Information). Viral infection and drug treatment was simultaneously applied to host cells. The efficacy and corresponding accumulative equivalent dose of the 72 drug combinations revealed a broad spectrum of VSV infection rates ( Figure 3A ). The capacity for infection inhibition of each drug, as well as the quantitative interaction with the other drugs in the 12-drug pool were evaluated with the STRICT algorithm at 12 h ( Figure 3B ) and 24 h ( Figure 3C ).

Viral infection and drug treatment was simultaneously applied to host cells. The viral infection from each drug treatment was recorded at 12 h ( Figure 4A) . A parabolic polynomial model was built with stepwise regression following the combinatorial optimization studies. When assessing the drug interaction coefficients as well as the parabolic response surfaces, broad synergy was subsequently observed (Figure 4B-D; Equation S1, Supporting Information). The optimal combination (Optimal Combo 1) mediated a 1.5% VSV infection rate compared to no drug treatment and was comprised of Amantadine HCl (5 \u00d7 10 \u22126 m), Azithromycin (5 \u00d7 10 \u22126 m), Chloroquine Diphosphate (0.5 \u00d7 10 \u22126 m), and Ribavirin (2.5 \u00d7 10 \u22126 m). Optimal Combo 2 mediated an infection rate of 1.6% compared to no drug treatment and was comprised of Amantadine HCl (5 \u00d7 10 \u22126 m), Azithromycin (5 \u00d7 10 \u22126 m), Chloroquine Diphosphate (0.5 \u00d7 10 \u22126 m), and Omeprazole Sodium (0.5 \u00d7 10 \u22126 m) ( Table 1) . Of note, both of these combinations were based on individual drug doses that were lower than the high doses needed to Adv. Therap. 2020, 2000034 achieve sufficient efficacy as monotherapies. It is important to note that for many of the top-ranked combinations, the component therapies exhibited unfavorable efficacy when delivered as monotherapies, but played a key role in mediating optimal efficacy when co-administered. As an example, for Amantadine HCl, Chloroquine Diphosphate, and Omeprazole Sodium, monotherapy was shown to be relatively ineffective at high doses. Compared to no drug treatment, Amantadine (HCl) treatment exhibited infection rates of \u224875%. Chloroquine Diphosphate treatment exhibited infection rates of \u224825%, and Omeprazole Sodium treatment exhibited infection rates of \u224850%. To further evaluate the importance of drug and dose optimization in system-atic combination therapy design, it is important to note that Optimal Combo 1 and Sub-Optimal Combo 2 were comprised of the same therapies, but at different doses. This alone resulted in infection rates of 1.5% and 10.7%, an approximately sevenfold difference in efficacy and demonstrating the importance of simultaneous drug and dose optimization. This is further confirmed by the scenario where replacing Amantadine HCl with Omeprazole Sodium and administering this combination at a sub-optimal dose results in a 21.6% infection rate. This represents a 14-fold difference in efficacy compared to Optimal Combo 1. With regards to the factors contributing toward the optimal treatment outcomes, analysis of the interaction terms showed that the effects were primarily due to single-drug contributions, drug quadratic effects, 2-drug interaction synergy as well as 3drug interaction synergy ( Figure 4E ; Equation S2-S4, Supporting Information).",

Repurposed monotherapies and combination therapies carry the benefit of previously demonstrated safety in patients and threshold efficacy for other indications. Therefore, it is common in these scenarios to select a small pool of established therapies to coadminister, and to adjust drug doses accordingly if toxicity issues ensue. While shown to be potentially clinically effective for some patients, this is largely a trial-and-error strategy.

            "text": "Project IDentif.AI sought to overcome this barrier that is pervasive across the drug development roadmap for virtually all indications, and demonstrate that the rapid interrogation of a 12drug parameter space could be completed within a timespan of days. In lieu of drug selection followed by dose finding, we used a previously established quadratic correlation between the 12-drug Table 1 . AI-optimized regimens. Two optimal, sub-optimal, and non-optimal combinations from those experimentally tested during the AI optimization process are shown (units = micromolar). pool and drug doses (input) as well as inhibition of A549 infection by VSV and A549 viability (outputs) to systematically identify the top drug combinations. This was achieved independent of any prior knowledge of drug targets, mechanism-of-action, or complex disease biology. Furthermore, the implementation of our platform does not require training based on existing data sets or big data. Instead, a specified set of experiments based on a broad spectrum of drug-dose combinations that sufficiently rep-resents the parameter space that is created by the 12-drug set is prospectively conducted. As such, the optimization process is driven completely by prospectively validated data on a cell line or patient sample. Many efforts to evaluate drug sets for single drug treatment or sampled combinations have been conducted. Global optimization of combination therapy design from a large drug set opens up the doors to a broader spectrum of actionable regimens. As our study has shown, even when combinations comprised of the same drugs are administered at varying doses, a sevenfold difference in efficacy was observed, and even greater differences (14fold) were observed when one drug was substituted (omeprazole sodium) for another (amantadine HCl, yielding a combination of azithromycin-chloroquine diphosphate-omeprazole sodiumribavirin) under sub-optimal dosing conditions. This is an interesting finding considering the single drug substitution resulted in such a profound disparity in treatment outcomes, even if all of the drugs considered comprised the top 2 optimal combinations. This further demonstrated the importance of simultaneous drug/dose optimization. Importantly, this process produced multiple drug/dose-optimized combinations within 3 days. This approach has the potential of providing a pipeline of alternatives for patients if issues such as drug resistance are encountered. It is important to emphasize that this study was conducted using an in vitro VSV model, and the top ranked drug combination has not been subsequently clinically validated. In addition, the VSV model was selected primarily due to it being a well-characterized and readily available platform. If a different disease platform and/or host model are used, it is highly probable that the ranking, drugs that comprise the combinations, and the number of drugs that mediate optimal performance will change. Also, this study was conducted with a diverse range of potential drug candidates. In a clinical setting, especially to address COVID-19 or other clinically relevant pathogens, the pool of drug candidates, which should be developed in consultation with the treating clinical team, is likely to differ substantially from the pool used in this study. Furthermore, if this approach is applied toward clinical samples, patient-specific rankings of optimal combinations can potentially emerge. The importance of the findings of this study are centered on the ability to rapidly interrogate massive parameter spaces that are created when both the right drugs and their right respective doses have to simultaneously reconciled. The ability to reconcile this extraordinarily large set of possible combinations in a timely fashion into actionable and globally optimized combinations may be effective www.advancedsciencenews.com www.advtherap.com for scenarios where the prevention of community spread of novel and aggressive pathogens is critical. While additional further clinical validation at the point-of-care is required, several key factors pertaining to the broad clinical relevance and prior validation of technologies related to Project IDentif.AI should be noted. Firstly, previous oncology studies using the quadratic phenotypic optimization platform (QPOP) and CURATE.AI, which are foundational to Project IDentif.AI, have demonstrated that benchtop-based implementation of this approach have directly led to markedly enhanced patient outcomes compared to traditionally observed results. [33, 34] Additional clinical validation studies, including one study that harnessed a related AI-guided dosing platform against HIV in humans have further demonstrated the critical importance of drug dosage in mediating optimal treatment efficacy and tolerability. [34, 35] Of note, doses that are lower than expected, as well as dosages that were dynamically modulated were commonly used to optimize patient outcomes.",

In turn, this may lead to the introduction of performancebased contracting or quality-based price discrimination, which are suitable pathways to explore, especially if they result in better health outcomes while reducing the cost of care. [37] This concept led to a proposed personalized treatment plan for diabetes patients by using the patients' dose-effect characteristics. They subsequently reported substantial cost reductions and improvements in health outcomes. [37] From the perspective of healthcare providers, financial incentives can improve health care quality, efficiency, and coverage. [38] Many countries have implemented a performance-based approach to contracting for medical services, which has also led to improvements in domains beyond healthcare quality and efficiency. For example, this approach in the U.S. is implemented under the name of \"pay for performance\" or \"payment by results\" in the U.K. These strategies have shown that performance-based contracting can improve social welfare, [39] an important consideration considering that pandemic mortality rates have been linked to social inequality, with higher mortality rates being observed with lower socioeconomic status patients. [40] Therefore, in the context of global health and addressing epidemics and pandemics, the impact of AI-guided healthcare will likely expand beyond technical advances and also influence the broader domains of healthcare economics and equality.",

For example, prolonged overburdening of providers, patients, payers and policymakers due to pandemics, coupled with ageing populations can lead to unsustainable healthcare infrastructures. When considering the core disease areas that receive the most attention, such as cancer, diabetes, and cardiovascular, the reality is that communicable infection remains a formidable healthcare infrastructural burden. [41] For example, in many parts of the world, there remains a need to develop better infectious disease interventions to fight the overuse of antibiotics (positioned to consume 10 million lives annually by 2050). [42] This challenge alone could have dramatic economic consequences. Considering the regional relevance of this problem, \u224880% of the malaria parasites in parts of Thailand and Vietnam were resistant to artemisinin and piperaquine, and that the failure rates of the among the most potent frontline combination therapy regimens comprised of dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHA-PPQ) had reached as high as 87% in Northern Thailand. [43] Many solutions ranging from vaccines to novel drug designs are being proposed to address the COVID-19 situation. However, maintaining agility in modulating drug regimens to account for potentially rapid viral mutation or other factors that could dynamically predict patient responses and identify corresponding optimized interventions will be critical. Dengue, which affects more than 400 million people each year, is highly-dynamic based on variables such as geographical climate. A recent study has suggested that 8000 cases of TB could be prevented each year solely through the use of more advanced analytics. [44] The economic evaluation of interventions may become increasingly important as extraordinary circumstances strain healthcare system-wide operations as well as industry operations. Therefore, governments and healthcare systems may be under pressure to substantially impact their quality-adjusted-life-years (QALY) and disability-adjusted-lifeyears (DALY). It should also be noted that the compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in global spend on drug research and development was 3.6% between 2010 and 2017, outpacing global sales of prescription drugs, which grew at a CAGR of 2.0% during the same period. [45] Further analysis has shown that the www.advancedsciencenews.com www.advtherap.com same life expectancy in countries could be achieved at 30% of current healthcare expenditures. [46] Therefore, the importance of accomplishing more while using less resources, making healthcare systems more economically-viable, and maximizing the potential of deploying AI into the agile and dynamic deployment of therapeutic regimens cannot be overstated.",

Based on historical experience, the next big outbreak will be something we have not seen before. In February 2018, The World Health Organization (WHO) added to the R&D Blueprint list of priority of diseases, Disease X. [47] Clade X was previously considered a hypothetical variant of an existing family of organisms that evolved to cause human disease. A preparedness exercise using this modelled pandemic-causing pathogen demonstrated that a lack of actionable interventions could cause devastating global outcomes. [48] As exhibited with the recent emergence of COVID-19, there are adequate tools to rapidly identify and obtain genomic details in near real time through modern sequencing techniques that often enable the swift development of effective diagnostics. [49] However, the ability to develop medical therapeutics that are both effective and easily deployable remains a critical gap in epidemic response efforts. Vaccines and therapeutics for the past two outbreaks have benefited from greater than 20 years of development efforts that allowed for rapid advancement to human use clinical studies. In epidemic situations interventions that address both individual patient illness and control/prevention of continued transmission are necessary. The spectrum of disease caused by emerging/re-emerging infectious diseases can vary considerably including severe symptomatic disease, moderate/mild symptomatic disease, and asymptomatic spreaders. Moreover, convalescence remains a challenge as recovering patients may continue to shed virus, sometimes for extended periods of time after initial infection. Therefore, effective therapeutics and interventions must have the ability to address the full spectrum of disease and contribute to controlling transmission and spread of the pathogen.",

[50] While traditional development times for Mabs frame (6 months to years), overall costs (\u2265$100 per gram), [51] and laborious clinical administration (intravenous), has previously limited their utility in emergency situations, especially in austere and resource-limited clinical settings, substantial efforts have been directed to overcome these challenges. [52] This will play a key role in bringing these critically important and potentially high-efficacy and high-specificity interventions toward broader use. Numerous efforts have considered drug repurposing for infectious disease indications as an approach to quickly respond to an outbreak. Small molecule therapeutics are ideal for rapid deployment in response to an epidemic because they are often stable at room temperature, easily available and have known human pharmacokinetic and safety profiles. [53] Most successful cases of drug repurposing have been largely serendipitous clinical discoveries, however tremendous effort has also been focused on rational drug repurposing through pathogenic phenotypic in silico and in vitro screening efforts. How these drugs works are often complex and can be on-target or off-target of the original indication. On-target mechanisms of action(s) (MOAs) are often useful targets to block pathogen attachment, entry, and replication within the host. Existing viral drugs are usually the first to be applied to novel viral threats. An additional benefit with repurposed molecules is their potential off-target impacts on a pathogen. These off-target effects are usually harder to define during development.",

[55] In vitro and especially in vivo testing of single drugs or combinations can be a lengthy process (months to years).

Emerging in silico modelling and AI approaches that are driven by prospective experimental validation are converging to allow for potentially rapid responses to outbreak and pandemic events.

E) The adjusted R values of the polynomial models built by stepwise regression increase as 2-drug and 3-drug interaction terms are added. However, the addition of 4-drug and 5-drug interaction terms makes no difference, indicating the overall anti-viral efficacy is mainly attributed from single drug contributions, drug quadratic effects, 2-drug interaction synergy and 3-drug interaction synergy.
