We identified members of the Circoviridae and Parvoviridae families as the major mucus-contaminating viruses. The fecal pig virome, which in theory should be similar to the mucosal virome, was examined recently via HTS and our findings were similar in relation to the main virus families identified. Nevertheless, the proportion of each virus family generally differed, which could perhaps be due to variation between animals, where studies were conducted on individual pigs from one or a limited number of herds [5, 6] . It should be emphasized that most of the identified viruses were not porcine pathogens. For example, whilst PCV2 (the main detected species) is responsible for the postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome [23] , PCV1 seems to be non-pathogenic. Porcine bocaviruses are diverse and have not yet been associated with disease [24, 25] . These are interesting findings, as most testing guidelines for the viral safety of biological products are dominated by the search for porcine pathogens. This is evidently due to bias as veterinary virology is dominated by research on animal diseases. Indeed, most of the zoonotic viruses infecting humans are either weakly, or not at all pathogenic in their animal reservoir. Therefore we should remain cautious about predicting the impact of such \"non-pathogenic\" animal viruses on human health. Moreover, we mainly detected positive-ssRNA or -ssDNA viruses, which are known to harbor marked capabilities in adapting to new hosts following successful initial cross- transmission events. On the other hand, we did not detect viruses known to be transmissible to humans, such as influenza [26] , HEV [27] and EMCV [28] , while the zoonotic status of some of the identified viruses (rotavirus [29] and norovirus [30] ) are still the subject of fierce debate. The level of sensitivity of our pipeline is close to that of PCR for known viruses as shown previously for a depth of sequencing close to 8 million reads per sample [13] and confirmed recently for a higher depth of sequencing similar to that used in this study, which in addition allows for a better genome coverage [31] . So, it seems unlikely that a high load of a virus able to challenge the drastic manufacturing process of heparin could escape detection. The pipeline has also been shown to detect viruses very distant from known species (this paper and [3] ), but it remains indeed possible that a virus very far from those already present in databases might escape such detection.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 601, "end": 604, "text": "[5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 605, "end": 607, "text": "6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 817, "end": 821, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 935, "end": 939, "text": "[24,", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 940, "end": 943, "text": "25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 1735, "end": 1739, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 1746, "end": 1750, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1760, "end": 1764, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 1838, "end": 1842, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 1857, "end": 1861, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 2069, "end": 2073, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 2220, "end": 2224, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 2463, "end": 2466, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The number of NGS reads is not proportional to the relative abundance of viral genomes, as the different genome types (single/ double stranded DNA/RNA) are amplified differently.

Due to the study's objective and the resultant viral diversity, we decided to focus quantitative analysis on a subset of those viruses which may be especially resilient to removal or inactivation during the manufacturing process i.e. Circoviridae and Parvoviridae. Both are very resistant to physical and chemical inactivation, and in addition, are the smallest of vertebrate viruses (17e24 nm and 18e26 nm respectively), and thus are the most difficult to clear by nanofiltration. Among the Parvoviridae, we chose two species: porcine bocavirus, representing 79.5% of Parvoviridae reads, and the new PPV7 virus, to model unknown viruses which would not have been detected using current PCR methods. Circoviruses and the two parvoviruses were present in 9/10 batches (PPV7 was not detected in batch 10). Viral loads were high and remarkably similar between batches, which is probably a consequence of frequent shedding and the large size of the tested pools (several hundred pigs), which probably averages out viral loads.
