For this study, changes in the air quality index (AQI) and the concentrations of six air pollutants (PM 2.5 , PM 10 , CO, SO 2 , NO 2 , and O 3 ) were evaluated during the Covid-19 control period in northern China. Overall, the air quality improved, most likely due to reduced emissions from the transportation and secondary industrial sectors. Specifically, the transportation sector was linked to the NO 2 emission reductions, while lower emissions from secondary industries were the major cause for the reductions of PM 2.5 and CO. The reduction in SO 2 concentrations was only linked to the industrial sector. However, the reductions in emissions did not fully eliminate air pollution, and O 3 actually increased, possibly because lower fine particle loadings led to less scavenging of HO 2 and as a result greater O 3 production. These results also highlight need to control emissions from the residential sector.",

Pollution emissions from the transportation and industrial sectors were expected to decrease, and the following questions can be asked: Did the air quality improve during the control of Covid-19? If so, how was the improvement related to the reduced emissions from these two sectors? Also, what was the major cause for the improvements in air quality and which atmospheric species were most affected? Answering these questions is a way to evaluate the influences of traffic and industrial emissions on air quality during winter in China. The results of the evaluation can then be used to make recommendations regarding air pollution control during winter in China.",

During the control period, a series of measures was undertaken to reduce gatherings of people (China State Council, 2020) . Specifically, all non-essential factories were shut down, and schools were closed as were all entertainment venues and restaurants. A dramatic reduction in road traffic was observed during the control period. For example, the flow of commercial trucks and buses in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region and its surrounding areas decreased by 77% and 39%, respectively, during the control period (MEP, 2020).",

The AQI averaged over all stations decreased by 20%, from 89.6 before the control period for Covid-19 to 71.6 during the controls (Fig. 2) , demonstrating an overall improvement in air quality from the control measures. A total of 322 of the 366 cities studied experienced a decline in the AQI. The highest AQI reductions occurred in the Ningxia, Shandong, and Henan Provinces (Fig. S1 ), which normally have high numbers of vehicles in use (Shandong and Henan) (Fig. S2a ) and many secondary industries in operation (Ningxia, Shandong, and Henan) (Fig. S2b ). The lowest AQI reductions occurred in the Yunnan, Guizhou, and Hainan Provinces (Fig. S1) , where motor vehicle usage and secondary industries are relatively low (Fig. S2) . Therefore, the improvement of air quality apparently was related to the number of motor vehicles in use and the percentages of secondary industries in each province. The AQI in 366 urban areas had the highest correlation coefficient (r 2 of 0.99) with the PM 2.5 before and during the control of Covid-19, which reflects the fact that fine particles were the major air pollutant throughout the study.",

A total of 331 (309, 366) of the 366 cities studied experienced reductions in CO (SO 2 , NO 2 ). The highest reductions of CO and NO 2 occurred in the Shandong and Henan Provinces (Figs. 3, S5) where there are large numbers of motor vehicles and many secondary industries (Fig. S2 ). This suggests that the reduced emissions from the transportation and industrial sectors were what caused the concentrations of these two gases to decrease. The largest decreases in SO 2 were found in Shanxi and Jiangxi Provinces (Fig. 4) , which have low numbers of vehicles but many secondary industries (Fig. S2 ). This indicates that the reduced SO 2 concentration was probably caused by the lower emissions from secondary industries during the control period.",

Therefore, the reduction in the PM 2.5 is best explained by lower emissions from the transportation and industrial sector. The reduced NO 2 concentrations were positively correlated with both vehicle numbers (R 2 = 0.44, p b 0.001; Fig. 6 ) and industrial NO x emissions (R 2 = 0.36, p b 0.01; Fig. 6 ), indicating that decreased emissions from both the transportation and industrial sectors led to improvements in NO 2 . As the reduced NO 2 concentrations were more strongly correlated with vehicle population than with the industrial NO x emissions, transportation probably was more responsible for the decrease in NO 2 concentrations. The SO 2 concentrations showed a significant positive relationship with industrial SO 2 emissions (R 2 = 0.16, p b 0.1; Fig. 6 ) but not with motor vehicle numbers.

Indeed, the residential sector became the major contributor (N50%) to PM 2.5 in representative cities of northwestern China during the winter of 2016-2017 (Yang et al., 2020) . Therefore, plans for controlling emissions from residences should be developed and implemented to combat air pollution during the winter in northern China.",

Despite restrictions placed on motor vehicles and secondary industries during the control period, air pollution continued to be problematic in large parts of northern China. The concentrations of O 3 actually increased during the control period, possibly because lower fine particle loadings led to less scavenging of HO 2 and as a result greater O 3 production. These results illustrate the importance of reactions that can occur between gaseous and particulate pollutants, but clearly, lowering the emissions of both NO x and VOC s will be needed to control O 3 . Results of our study highlight the importance of emissions from the residential sector for wintertime pollution in northern China, and they show that this source must be taken into account in developing pollution mitigation plans.
