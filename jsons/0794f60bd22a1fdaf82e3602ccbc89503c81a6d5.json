Initially, it deals with communication, economic issues and physician migration. Then it summarizes a wide field of mechanisms by which global forces affect health, indirectly or directly. Within this classification there has to be some overlap-for example the HIV virus causing AIDS would appear to be a direct health effect, but a shift in lifestyles that has seen an increase in the number of individuals' sexual partners-a shift that perhaps reflects a breakdown of family and religious value systems-may be the more fundamental, but indirect, cause. The view is primarily from the standpoint of developing countries, the \"South,\" and does not eschew controversy.",

Difficulties in identifying infection in a poorly equipped remote centre, or performing operations in a small district hospital, and so on, are mitigated by active on-line communication. These communications remain expensive, but they are cheaper than transporting patients. The best-known example of the value of central laboratories in monitoring outbreaks of infections is the Centres for Disease Control in Atlanta, Georgia, USA.",

Subtle and sophisticated methods of communication with high-pressure presentation and advertising techniques are available, aiming to force compliant behaviour by readers and viewers, whether they are the general public, children, or potential consumers. The potential dangers of the so-called new non-communicable diseases (and of others such as diabetes, malignancy, accidental and non-accidental trauma, and family dissolution) are now recognized, as is the effect of lifestyle on them. However, the urgency that needs to pervade this subject is still missing. Even the name dulls, and perhaps the word non-communicable should be consigned to history or be entirely discarded. The term neo-communicable disease (NCD) is proposed for these conditions: this should, if only subconsciously, instil a sense of urgency.",

It should be noted that the common index based on per capita income alone may not be an adequate measure of poverty in a rural area where much food is grown and living expenses are low, whether in a unitary or in an extended family. But exactly the same cash income may be inadequate if even one member of the family is in an urban area, or if the family is split up.

Although GM foods may or may not have direct health effects, the transnational marketing of these would be harmful if farming in a country is adversely affected, leading to urbanization, breakdown of families, more cost to the government in developing cities, crime, lack of family support systems for the elderly, and so on. Unplanned urban growth is now globally epidemic. The breakdown of rural agriculture and an unwillingness to develop a strategy for industries in rural areas contribute to this problem. Independence of rural communities is also seriously at risk in this era of cheap mass production and interdependence. In this sense, multisectoral interdependance is a global threat to health.",

But globalisation and World Trade Organization policies that allow food subsidies and import protection selectively in rich countries and try to forbid them in poor countries undermine food security. (The subsidy issue is currently relevant to the WTO, China, India, Brazil, USA, and EEC.) Sometimes food produced in the developed world is cheaper than food produced in the developing world, as farmers in developing countries faced with the loss of subsidies for fertiliser often price themselves out of the market (and also may incur such losses that they give up farming). Youth, who no longer wish to look after farms, become unemployed and move into towns. This can cause even more problems by undermining farming and fishing and increasing urbanisation in the developing world. Indirect effects then result from increasing urban and rural poverty. These increase disease (because of bad housing, inadequate water supply, and poor sanitation). So both food production and the economy of the country suffer disastrous consequences. A self-sustaining way of life seems to become eroded, and pockets of poverty increase. Naturally, higher productivity in developed countries is to be welcomed and emulated, but protectionism is not welcome. Other global phenomena indirectly affecting health include the development of crop predator agrochemical resistance-as this spreads across countries, international co-ordination for its control is needed.",

So the new poverty that accompanies some of the current economic policies constitutes a disappointing new threat, even though the basic policies set out originally to reduce poverty. Income disparities, as well as disparities in nutrition and education, are increasing in many countries. Poverty and unfulfilled aspirations are causes of violence.

These disadvantages are not adequately compensated by increasing contacts, introduction of new ideas, or financial inflow to the donor country. Often the pull from the developed world is increased because it does not produce enough physicians of its own. The credibility of international health and educational organisations is affected because they may be thought to be trying to train more economically in the 'South' a product for the 'North.'

Companies with a monopoly can also control pricing and supply, irrespective of the direct or indirect health effects of such policies. These practices produce problems at a global level; however, industry in the developing world is just starting to compete more effectively. The outcome of the debates about retroviral drugs in South Africa and Brazil is a good example of the global arguments and how they can sometimes benefit the poor. But industry may also do harm, for example, by promoting disposable equipment-rather than making good reusable equipment-despite the risk that poor countries reuse what should have been discarded, with all attendant risks, because the alternative is too expensive.",

Fossil fuel consumption produces greenhouse gases, and even worse, the destruction of forests provides some of the fuel. These are causes of ill health and poverty because they affect sources of income. The loss of forest cover and changes in rainfall and desertification are also alarming as they cause population shifts and displacement-with, again, poverty and disease. Recent difficulties in persuading the richer nations to cut back illustrate the real magnitude of the problem-if the Third World populations were to consume quarter the amount of fossil fuel used by the North, the world would vanish.",
