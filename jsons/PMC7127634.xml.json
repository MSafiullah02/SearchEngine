The virus also infects the bovine respiratory tract and it has been associated with winter dysentery in adult cattle [2], [3]. Disease outcomes\u2019 induced by BCoV are responsible for significant economical losses to beef and dairy industries worldwide. These losses are not only the figure of mortalities, which may reach 80% in some complicated cases, but also reflect the veterinary costs, medications and poor productivity of affected animals [4].",

Compared to conventional gel-based PCR assays, real-time PCR has many advantages including rapidity, higher sensitivity, specificity and throughput, lower hand-on-time, minimal contamination rate, quantitative measurement, automation, and easy standardization [11]. All real-time amplification methods depend on the detection and quantification of a fluorescent reporter molecule whose signal increases in proportion to the generated amplicon. The simplest and most cost-effective method involves the use of DNA intercalating dye such as SYBR Green I as a fluorescent reporter. However, the major disadvantage is that the dye molecules may bind to any double stranded DNA in the reaction including non-specific products and primer-dimmers, which requires melt curve analysis to control the specificity of the reaction [12]. A single report described the use of SYBR Green I for detection of 32 animal coronaviruses including BCoV using degenerate primers [13]. This test could be used only for detection of new, uncharacterized coronaviruses rather than for specific identification of BCoV.",

No sequence homology revealed using these primers with group 1 and 3 coronaviruses, however, cross reactivity with members of group 2 coronaviruses is expected. Previously described primers for amplification of the entire N gene were used in construction of the quantification standards (Amer et al., 2008). Internal control primers were designed on the basis of highly conserved sequences in the bovine glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (BGAPDH) gene for use in validation of RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis and qPCR steps.

The assay was carried out in a total volume of 25 \u03bcl reaction mixture prepared in triplicates in 96-well optical reaction plates or MicroAmp\u00ae optical tubes (Applied Biosystems). The reaction conditions were first optimized by testing variable concentrations of BCoV and internal control QPCR primer sets; MgCl2 concentrations; template volumes and primer annealing temperatures.

The fluorescence was measured at the end of each cycle. Following amplification, a melt curve analysis was performed to verify the specificity of the amplified products by their specific melting temperatures (Tm). Melting curve analysis consisted of a denaturation step at 95 \u00b0C for 15 s, decreased to 60 \u00b0C for 1 min, and followed by temperature increase to 95 \u00b0C at a rate of 1% with continuous reading of fluorescence. Data acquisition and analysis of the results were performed using the 7500 System SDS Software Version 2.0.1 (Applied Biosystems). Each fluorescent reporter signal was measured against the internal reference dye (ROX) signal to normalize for non-PCR related fluorescence fluctuations between wells.

Therefore, monitoring PCR inhibitors in the utilized samples is very important to avoid false negative results. One of the most important methods for monitoring PCR inhibitors is the inclusion and/or detection of an internal positive control (IPC) in the test samples [26]. The added advantage of using an IPC is the ability to control and normalize the variable conditions of the assay starting from the efficiency of sample extraction and ending with the real-time amplification/detection. In the process of developing the present assay, a primer set specific for the house keeping gene \u201cGlyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)\u201d of bovine species was included in the reaction. Specific identification of the IPC product by melt curve analysis revealed a clearly distinguished melt peak of 82.54 \u00b1 0.32 \u00b0C. Analysis of variance revealed no significant differences in the assay performance between monoplex and duplex reactions in terms of specificity, sensitivity and linearity (data not shown).

However, none of these systems utilized the SYBR Green I chemistry for specific detection and quantification of BCoV. The main advantages of SYBR Green I over other real-time PCR detection formats are; a) it is a low-cost fluorochrome, b) it is a simpler approach especially for primer design and optimization procedures [31], and c) the artifacts commonly observed in specific probes, particularly at amplification cycles beyond the 30th, are minimal and can be ruled out by melt curve analysis [32].",

The method is convenient for early differential diagnosis of calf diarrhea and bovine respiratory disease syndromes. In addition, the rapid results obtained by this method are crucial for proper herd management and prevention of disease spread. Moreover, this assay can be considered as a suitable alternative for the regular methods used for studying BCoV pathogenesis and vaccine trials.",
