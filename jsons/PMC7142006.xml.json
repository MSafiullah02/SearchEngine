            "text": "On February 1, 2020 at the start of the epidemiological survey, the most important issue was to assess the development of coronavirus disease 2019-related symptoms and/or signs in the patient during her stay on Jeju Island. However, the patient had already been admitted to a quarantine hospital in China, so I could not contact her directly. Instead, I contacted her daughter, since they were traveling companions. Using WeChat (www.wechat.com) with the assistance of an interpreter, I asked whether the patient\u2019s symptoms appeared during their stay on Jeju Island and inquired about the route of their tour. She stated that her mother\u2019s fever started on January 26, 2020. Therefore, the author interpreted that the patient\u2019s stay on Jeju Island\u2014between January 21, 2020 (-5 days) and January 25, 2020 (-1 day)\u2014was during the incubation period. This estimate was based on a previous report, published on January 29, 2020, stating that the mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence interval, 4.1 to 7.0) [1].",
