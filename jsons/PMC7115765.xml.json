            "text": "In view of the chance of spread and subsequent protracted physical and psychological morbidity and mortality, those with infectious diseases are known to be stigmatized (Goffman, 1963; Lau et al., 2005; Link & Phelan, 2001; Malcolm et al., 1998; ). Among various infectious diseases, the stigma attached to HIV/AIDS has been the most blatant and widely studied (Crawford, 1996). Over the decades, evidence has shown that individuals with or being suspected of having HIV/AIDS have been denied health care services and employment, refused entry to foreign countries, shunned by neighbors and co-workers, and experienced social disruptions with family members and friends (Crandall & Coleman, 1992; Herek, 1999). Stigmatization towards individuals with TB has also been reported. Infected individuals are often regarded as dirty and their level of contagiousness is greatly exaggerated (Yamada, Caballero, Matsunaga, Agustin, & Magana, 1999). Fear and isolation of individuals with TB is common, even among their families and friends (Jaramillo, 1999; Kelly, 1999). Besides HIV/AIDS and TB, stigma towards other infectious diseases such as SARS (Lee, Chan, Chau, Kwok, & Kleinman, 2005), syphilis (Whitty, 1999), and genital herpes (Breitkopf, 2004; Fortenberry, 2004) has also been documented. Generally speaking, stigma of infectious diseases can be as devastating to the infected individuals as the diseases themselves.",

Such attitudinal effects may impact resource allocation and direction of public health planning (Gilmore & Somerville, 1994; Goldin, 1994; Herek, Capitanio, & Widaman, 2003). In other words, illness perceptions and perceived risks of infection can play an important role, sometimes more so than the actual disease itself, in shaping public responses to health care policies (Burris, 2000). Previous studies have used some of these illness perceptions, including controllability, internality, behavioral causality, responsibility, blame, infection risk, severity, and incurability (Bos, Kok, & Dijker, 2001; Crandall & Moriarty, 1995; Dijker, Kok, & Koomen, 1996; Peters, den Boer, Kok, & Schaalma, 1994) to understand stigma towards AIDS and other physical diseases. Extending from this line of research, the present study used an attribution model to compare public stigma towards HIV/AIDS, SARS, and TB, and examined the effects of stigma on policy attitudes among the general public in Hong Kong.",

First recognized a little over three decades ago, it swiftly received public health attention due to its lethality. In Hong Kong, the introduction of highly active anti-retroviral therapies (HAART) has transformed the disease to a chronic illness. Since 1996, the number of AIDS cases has consistently declined, resulting in the lowest number of cases in 2004 (Hong Kong Centre for Health Protection, 2005). Nevertheless, the number of HIV infections in Hong Kong has reached its highest point ever reported in the same year. Despite the promising results in counteracting AIDS, HIV infection continues to be a primary public health concern in Hong Kong. In light of public health efforts in preventing the transmission of the three infectious diseases, the aim of the present study was to examine and compare public's views towards these diseases and identify possible social cognitive correlates related to their stigma.",

Among different attributions, controllability was found to be strongly associated with stigma (Corrigan, 2000; Weiner, Perry, & Magnusson, 1988). When the public regards contraction of the disease to be controllable by the individuals, the public is more likely to hold the infected individuals to be responsible for their own illness. Hence, the public is more likely to blame the individuals and reject them from society (Corrigan et al., 2000; Corrigan, Markowitz, Watson, Rowan, & Kubiak, 2003). Support of such attributional pathway has been found in psychiatric stigma (Corrigan, 2000). However, this chain has yet to be tested on stigma towards infectious diseases. To examine comprehensively the attribution model of stigma towards infectious diseases, the present study tested the pathway of controllability, responsibility, and blame to stigma among the general public in Hong Kong. We hypothesized that people who attributed the control of contracting the disease to be internal to the individuals are likely to assign greater level of personal responsibility to these individuals, and would be more likely to blame them and attach greater stigma to them.",

Research on public views of HIV/AIDS has shown that AIDS-related stigma shaped public attitude towards HIV Surveillance Policy (Herek & Capitanio, 1993; Herek et al., 2003). Although public health resource allocation should be commensurate with public health needs, the surge of epidemics in Hong Kong indicated that public health resources might not be prioritized to the most pressing public health problems due to bias in public demand. Based on previous findings, it was hypothesized that stigma might come into play in affecting the general public's attitudes on resource allocation prevention, public education, research, and civil protection of infected people. Using a population-based, randomized household telephone survey, the present study aimed to assess and compare public attitudes towards these three types of infectious diseases, identifying the attributional sources of stigma, and exploring the relationships between stigma and public attitudes towards government policies.",

The scale was designed to be applicable across all three disease conditions and to be unidimensional.

The reliability of the scale was satisfactory (Cronbach's alpha=.85 for HIV/AIDS, .81 for SARS, and .83 for TB).

Then, multi-sample structural equation modeling (SEM) was conducted to test the proposed structural model relating controllability, responsibility, and blame to stigma. Three steps were followed in multi-sample analysis. First, all parameters were freely estimated across three samples in the baseline model (Model 1). Next, the factor loadings of stigma were constrained to be equal across samples in the model of factor invariance (Model 2). Third, the path coefficients between constructs were constrained to be equal across samples in the equal factor correlation model (Model 3). Both CFA and SEM were performed using EQS for Windows Version 6.1 (Bentler, 2003), which uses the maximum likelihood method to examine the overall fit of the models to the correspondent observed variance/covariance matrices.",

Before the findings are discussed in further detail, some limitations of the present study are noted. First, to reduce the time of administration over the telephone and enhance the response rate, participants in the study were only randomly assigned to one disease condition instead of responding to all three conditions. Although this manipulation precluded concurrent examination of stigma and its psychosocial associates within the participant, given the sample across three disease conditions were similar and representative of the general population, merging the samples for aggregate analysis was deemed to be appropriate. Second, the stigma claimed by participants was relatively small, and it might suggest that their responses towards stigmatization and policy attitudes might be affected by social desirability. Although telephone survey is considered to be effective in ensuring anonymity thus maximizing honest responses from participants, we could not preclude the possibility that the participants may respond positively towards the three diseases. Thus, our findings might have underestimated the extent of stigmatization of the diseases.",

Results suggested that individuals with HIV/AIDS, TB, or those who were previously infected with SARS were stigmatized by the general public in a varying extent, with individuals diagnosed with HIV/AIDS being the most harshly and blatantly stigmatized, followed by those with TB and those who recovered from SARS. The public also perceived the infection of HIV/AIDS to be more internally controlled by the individuals and regarded individuals having HIV/AIDS as more responsible and blameworthy of their disease than their SARS and TB counterparts.",

Unlike TB and SARS, which are highly contagious but can be readily cured with antibiotic medications, HIV/AIDS has been widely perceived to be a fatal condition with little hope of recovery since its earliest days (Malcolm et al., 1998). Thus, in terms of physical limitations to the infected, the courses of TB and SARS are acute but time-limited, whereas that of HIV/AIDS is chronic. As for disease threat, although all three diseases are infectious, HIV/AIDS may be regarded as posing the greatest level of threat to the general public in terms of its lethality. Previous research on AIDS stigma has found the disease to be associated with perception of danger, fear of contagion, and overestimation of risks caused by casual contact (Herek & Capitanio, 1993; Herek, Capitanio, & Widaman, 2002). Compared with TB, which may be seen as relatively benign given its treatability, AIDS has been considered as incurable (Peters et al., 1994) As for SARS, no new cases have been reported since 2003, and recovered SARS patients are not regarded as a threat to the public.",

The general public may perceive those infected with HIV/AIDS to have contracted it through voluntary and immoral behaviors, leading to the assignment of controllability, responsibility, and blame, and greater level of stigmatization. In contrast, SARS and TB do not carry this moral package. Although SARS and TB are associated with physical suffering, they are considered to be caused mainly by external factors, such as bacterial infection and poor hygiene, which are not perceived as morally reprehensible (Kelly, 1999). Thus, stigmatization of SARS and TB may be driven mainly by the dread of the illness itself, which may be reduced with a decrease level of perceived threat (Lee et al., 2005; Person et al., 2004).",

Given that public stigma is driven by lay beliefs and emotional responses and lacks a knowledge base, education makes little difference to making the public more accepting of conditions that are aversive to their lay beliefs (Kaye, 1998). In other words, factual understanding of the disease plays only a small role in shaping stigmatizing attitudes towards infected individuals.

In the attribution process (Weiner, 1995), people first make attributions about the controllability of the individual's illness, whether the individual can control disease contraction by him/herself. Their control attribution then leads to inferences about the responsibility of the infected, whether the individual is held personally responsible for the disease or is deemed helpless in the circumstances. Such inferences lead to emotional reactions as to whether the individual should be blamed, and to what extent the individual should be stigmatized. In the present study, the effects of controllability and blame were found to be equivalent across diseases, whereas the effect of responsibility varied. In other words, while the influence of controllability and blame was equal across diseases in the attribution process, responsibility has greater weight in the determination of blame towards TB and HIV/AIDS than towards SARS. Given that SARS is an acute and nascent disease with its nature still uncertain, the public may be less likely to blame people for their infection when much is unknown about the disease. On the other hand, given that TB and HIV/AIDS have been around for some time, the public is more likely to blame the people who are deemed to be responsible for contracting the disease. In future studies, researchers should account for risk perceptions and other illness perceptions, such as dread and familiarity, to further analyze the sources of stigma. Moreover, longitudinal design should be used to establish causation and to trace the stigma trajectory as the disease progresses over time (Alonzo & Reynolds, 1995).",

Given that AIDS is widely publicized in the media and much medical attention has been paid in the treatment of HIV/AIDS across the globe, the public may regard the support for AIDS research as already sufficient, or not necessary in Hong Kong. As to the protection of individuals with TB, since TB is treatable, the public may regard the infected status to be temporary and thus does not warrant any special legislation to protect against discrimination.
