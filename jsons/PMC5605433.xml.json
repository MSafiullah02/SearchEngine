These federal public health travel restrictions are managed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and implemented by DHS and its component agencies. Whenever a person is added to or removed from the DNB list, their record is added to or removed from the PHLO concurrently.

Under the revised criteria, the individual must be known or believed to be infectious with, or exposed to, a communicable disease that would pose a public health threat should the individual travel, and additionally must meet at least one of the following three criteria: 1) be unable to be located, be unaware of diagnosis, be aware but noncompliant with public health requests, or have shown potential for noncompliance; 2) be at risk of traveling on a commercial flight or of traveling internationally by any means; or 3) need to be placed on the DNB list and issued a PHLO for effective response to an outbreak of a communicable disease or enforcement of a public health order [7]. The impetus for revising the criteria was to allow the DNB and PHLO to support a communicable disease outbreak. Revisions expanded the first criterion to allow travel restrictions to be considered for individuals with a known or believed exposure to a communicable, versus solely being confirmed or likely infectious with a communicable disease. An additional criterion was added allowing for placement on travel restrictions as part of a response to an outbreak of a communicable disease or a public health order for individuals who met the exposure criterion. The final revision was that individuals did not need to meet all listed criteria for placement, but rather meet the first criterion pertaining to known infectiousness or exposure plus only one of the other three criteria [8]. The sole criterion for removal from federal travel restrictions did not change: proof that the person is noninfectious or no longer at risk of becoming infectious, typically evidenced by laboratory documentation, lapse of the known period of infectiousness, or lapse of the incubation period without development of symptoms [8].",

We reviewed de-identified case data for all individuals considered for or placed on travel restrictions because of a suspected or confirmed communicable disease from May 22, 2007, to December 31, 2015; individuals considered for or placed on travel restriction related to an exposure to a communicable disease were not included in this analysis.

Since the report was published in 2008, the average number of requests for travel restrictions has been increasing each year, and California and Texas have maintained the greatest number of requests. This increase in consultation requests may be due to increased awareness of federal travel restrictions because of outreach and training by CDC staff and experiences shared among state health departments.",

The use of travel restrictions in approximately 6% of these patients who turn out not to have infectious TB appears reasonable when there is evidence that up to a fifth of patients with a clinical diagnosis of TB do not have bacteriologic evidence [12], [13].

CDC staff conduct regular case reviews and works with health departments to determine whether individuals are no longer infectious and can be removed from travel restrictions. Individuals on federal travel restrictions who are lost to follow up are maintained on the DNB and PHLO until they can be located, often through attempted travel, and can provide medical documentation to conclude that they are no longer infectious. Previous analyses have shown that those who are intercepted during travel across a land border are removed from the DNB/PHLO quicker than those who are not intercepted [14]. Our analysis also showed that the majority of travelers who were intercepted, either before boarding a commercial flight or at a land port of entry, achieved noninfectious status after a single interception event. This suggests that interception during travel provides a re-entry point to the public health system and an opportunity to reinitiate treatment and follow-up care by underscoring the importance of addressing their condition and protecting others.",

During the analysis period, six individuals were able to obtain boarding passes and fly on commercial aircraft despite being on the DNB list; all but one were detected during travel and intercepted at the arrival airport. Implementation of the Transportation Security Agency's (TSA) Secure Flight [15], an airline passenger prescreening program, in 2009 has resolved some issues identified in these instances. In addition, CDC works with state and local health departments to ensure all known aliases and identifiers are added to an individual's DNB and PHLO records to minimize the likelihood of evasion. When people have imminent travel scheduled while the DNB and PHLO additions are being processed, CDC and DHS staff work with state and local health departments to intercept them before flight departure even if they have already been issued a boarding pass or boarded an aircraft. Efforts to improve the travel restrictions process have also included the use of a secure, web-based platform to request DNB and PHLO actions. Since incorporation of this tool, administrative processing has been streamlined, improving data security and reducing the processing time for DNB/PHLO actions despite an increase in the number of requests and actions. Timely processing of DNB and PHLO actions ensures that travel is restricted only as long as necessary.",

Similarly, travel restrictions may have saved federal and local resources used to conduct investigations of passengers with potential exposures when individuals fly while infectious with a communicable disease. More data needs to be collected and further analysis completed to determine the specific resource and cost savings and exact number of exposures prevented in the traveling public.
