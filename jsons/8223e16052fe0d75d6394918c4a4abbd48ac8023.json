Activation of p42/p44 MAPKs was found to be sufficient to turn on VEGF mRNA. We demonstrated that the p42/p44 MAPK (Erk) signalling cascade controls VEGF expression at least at two levels. In normoxic conditions, MAPKs activate the VEGF promoter at the proximal ()88/)66) GC-rich region where Sp1/AP-2 transcriptional factors bind. This action is mediated via MAPK-dependent phosphorylation of Sp1 at two sites, threonines 453 and 739. These phosphorylations, which occur in vivo when the p42/p44 MAPK signalling cascade is activated, have a physiological significance. Tetracyclin-dependent induction of a double Sp1 mutant (T453A, T739A), not phosphorylatable, suppresses MAPK-dependent VEGF expression. This result clearly identifies two MAPK phosphorylation sites controlling the functionality of Sp1.",

This pleiotypic response is under the control of the 'master' transcriptional factor HIF-1, itself regulated by the postranscriptional control of the subunit HIF-1a. Recently it was established that it is the product of the von Hippel Lindau tumour suppressor gene (pVHL), which targets HIF-1a to the proteasome, an action suppressed by hypoxia. Concomitant to this hypoxic stress, HIF-1a translocates and accumulates in the nucleus where VEGF and several other genes are 'turned' on. To address whether nuclear translocation is involved in HIF-1a stabilization, we specifically trapped HIF-1a either in the cytoplasm or nucleus. We established that the oxygen-driven proteasomal degradation of HIF-1a takes place equally well irrespectively of the sub-cellular localization. This result sharply contrasts with the mechanism of degradation of p53, which only occurs in the cytoplasm, and requires the nuclear shuttling activity of the E3-ubiquitin ligase, MDM2. Although we clearly established that p42/p44 MAPKs do not participate in the stabilization of HIF-1a, MAPKs are, however, capable of phosphorylating HIF-1a in vivo. We showed that in vivo phosphorylation of HIF-1a by p42/p44 MAPK strongly enhanced VEGF gene transcription. Finally we demonstrated that the stress-activated protein kinases (JNK and p38/HOG) are essential for increasing the stability of VEGF mRNA.",

A positive action at the level of VEGF expression by targeting two transcription factors: Sp1 and HIF-1a and at the level of endothelial cells by promoting growth and survival. Therefore, inhibitors targeting specifically the Ras MAPK signalling cascade will have a profound impact on tumour development because they will suppress the amplification loop leading to cell survival and cell proliferation, at least at two levels: tumour cells and vascular endothelial cells.

            "text": "Tumor cells of different origin, macrophages, and T lymphocytes express fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF2) in vitro and in vivo. FGF2 lacks a classic signal peptide for secretion. However, cell damage may cause the release of FGF2 from producing cells. Also, an alternative mechanism of exocytosis of FGF2, independent of the endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi pathway, has been proposed. Accordingly, FGF2 has been found to be associated with the extracellular matrix (ECM) of cell cultures and located in the basement membranes of blood vessels. On this basis, FGF2 is thought to exert its effects on endothelial cells via a paracrine mode consequent to its release by other cells and/or mobilization from ECM. Besides experimental evidence for a paracrine mode of action for FGF2, some observations raise the hypothesis that FGF2 may also play an autocrine role in endothelial cells. Indeed, endothelial cells produce FGF2 that modulates cell proliferation and migration, as well as the production of proteinases and their receptors. In vivo, FGF2 expression occurs in the endothelium adjacent to neoplastic cells in several human tumor types. These neoplasms include neuroblastoma, astrocytoma, glioblastoma, meningioma, pheochromocytoma, melanoma, carcinomas of the stomach and colon, and adenocarcinomas of the larynx, endometrium, and cervix. Thus, FGF2 expression is a common feature of vascular endothelium during tumor angiogenesis.",

Recently, additional VEGF genes have been cloned and new insight has been obtained into the molecular mechanisms regulating the function of the endothelial cells in lymphatic vessels. VEGF-C and VEGF-D have been shown to stimulate lymphangiogenesis, and their receptor VEGFR-3 has been linked to human hereditary lymphoedema, although there is evidence that other genes are also involved. Such molecules may make it possible to regulate angiogenesis and lymphangiogenesis, as well as the tissue edema involved in many diseases. The VEGFR-3 receptor tyrosine kinase is related to the VEGF receptors, but does not bind VEGF, and its expression becomes restricted mainly to lymphatic endothelia during development. We have found that homozygous VEGFR-3 targeted mice die around the tenth day of embryonic development due to failure of cardiovascular development and that heterozygous missense mutations of VEGFR-3 that deactivate the tyrosine kinase activity are associated with human hereditary lymphedema. Two mouse models for lymphedema reproduce the essential features of this disease. We have also purified and cloned the VEGFR-3 ligand, VEGF-C, which is made as a precursor protein having an extended N-terminus and a C-terminal half containing extra cysteine-rich motifs characteristic of a protein component of silk. Transgenic mice expressing VEGF-C developed a hyperplastic lymphatic vessel network and show evidence of lymphangiogenesis. However, proteolytically processed VEGF-C was also capable of stimulating VEGFR-2 and was weakly angiogenic. VEGF-C induced vascular permeability, but its mutant point, which retained lymphangiogenic properties and activated only VEGFR-3, did not. VEGF-D is closely related to VEGF-C, similarly processed and binds to the same receptors. Thus, VEGF-C and VEGF-D appear to be both angiogenic and lymphangiogenic growth factors. When overexpressed as a transgene in the RIP-Tag model of pancreatic bcell tumors, VEGF-C induced the growth of peritumoral lymphatic vessels and was associated with lymphatic metastasis. VEGF-C overexpression also led to lymphangiogenesis and intralymphatic tumor growth in an orthotopic model of human breast carcinoma in SCID mice. Furthermore, soluble VEGFR-3 blocked these changes. However, VEGFR-3 is also induced in the blood vessels of various types of human cancer. Ongoing experiments address the role of the VEGFR-3 signaling pathway in embryonic and tumor angiogenesis and the mechanisms of lymphatic metastasis.",

FGF2 transfectants express all FGF2 isoforms and are characterized by a transformed morphology and an increased saturation density. FGF2 transfectants show invasive and morphogenetic behavior in three-dimensional gel that is prevented by anti-FGF2 antibodies, revealing the autocrine modality of the process. The biological consequences of this autocrine activation were investigated in vivo. FGF2transfected MAE cells induce the growth of highly vascularized tumors. In agreement with these observations, FGF2-transfected MAE cells induce an angiogenic response when implanted in the avascular rabbit cornea. Also, they cause an increase in vascular density and formation of hemangiomas in the chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) when injected into the allantoic sac of the chick embryo.

In addition, cidofovir inhibits the development of murine polyomavirus (PyV)-induced hemangiomas in rats by an as yet uncharacterized antiviral-independent mechanism. We investigated the effect of cidofovir on virus-independent vascular tumors originated by FGF2-T-MAE cells, a subclone of pZipbFGF2-MAE cells. In vitro, cidofovir was cytostatic for FGF2-T-MAE cells. Cidofovir did not affect FGF2-T-MAE cell sprouting in 3D fibrin gel and morphogenesis on Matrigel at non-cytotoxic concentrations. In vivo, cidofovir completely suppressed hemangioma formation on CAM induced by intra-allantoic injection of FGF2-T-MAE cells, without affecting the normal CAM vessels. Intratumoral or systemic administration of cidofovir caused a significant inhibition of the growth of subcutaneous, intraperitoneal, or intracerebral FGF2-T-MAE-xenografts in nude and SCID mice. Drug-induced apoptosis was observed in FGF2-T-MAE tumors as soon as 2 days after the beginning of treatment. Thus, cidofovir appears to inhibit the growth of endothelial-derived tumors via induction of apoptosis without exerting a direct anti-angiogenic activity. Cidofovir may be explored for the treatment of tumors that are not associated with an oncogenic virus.",

Antisense-FGF2 and FGF receptor-1 cDNAs inhibit neovascularization and growth of human melanomas in nude mice. Also, a significant correlation between the presence of FGF2 in cancer cells and advanced tumor stage has been reported. Recent observations have shown that a secreted FGF-binding protein can serve as an angiogenic switch for different tumor cell lines, including squamous cell carcinoma and colon cancer cells. Interestingly, targeting of FGF-binding protein with specific ribozymes reduces significantly the growth and vascularization of xenografted tumors in mice, despite the high levels of VEGF produced by these cells. These data suggest that modulation of FGF2 expression, release, and mobilization may allow a fine-tuning of the angiogenesis process, even in the presence of significant levels of VEGF. This hypothesis is supported by the capacity of the two factors to act synergistically in stimulating angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo.",

After transfection, independent clones were obtained in which FGF2 mRNA and protein were upregulated compared to parental cells. Also, the conditioned medium of Tet-FGF2 transfectants caused proliferation, urokinase-type plasminogen activator upregulation, migration, and sprouting of cultured endothelial cells. A 3-day treatment of Tet-FGF2 cell cultures with tetracycline abolished FGF2 overexpression and the biological activity of the conditioned medium without affecting their proliferative capacity. Tet-FGF2 cells formed tumors when injected s.c. in nude mice. Administration of 2.0 mg/ml tetracycline in the drinking water prior to cell transplantation and continously throughout the whole experiment inhibited FGF2 expression in Tet-FGF2 tumor lesions. This was paralleled by a significant decrease in the rate of tumor growth and vascularization to values similar to those observed in lesions generated by parental HEC-1-B cells. Tetracycline administration 20 days after tumor cell implant, although equally effective in reducing FGF2 expression and inhibiting tumor vascularity, only minimally impaired the growth of established Tet-FGF2 tumors.",

The demonstration that a given growth factor exerts a pharmacological angiogenic activity does not preclude that its inhibition might be beneficial in reducing pathological angiogenesis. For instance, basic peptides encoded by exon 6 of VEGF 189 aa can chase FGF2 from its storage sites in the corneal stroma and elicit a strong dose and sequence dependent angiogenic response, although they do not bind to VEGF receptors. The straightforward demonstration that heparin binding growth factors such as VEGF or FGF2 act by activating their receptors and not by releasing other growth factors from the extracellular matrix raises several methodologic points. Systemic delivery of growth factors is inefficient because they are sequestered onto heparan sulfates in the extracellular matrix of the vascular wall and therefore do not reach their target receptors.",

The measurement of the remaining functions exerted by mutant growth factors of which the binding domain is reduced to only one receptor provides an interesting clue, but the problem of the bioavailability is not solved. The pre-clinical and clinical data can demonstrate unambiguously that a growth factor or a growth factor receptor is up-regulated in pathological vessels and thus would represent a potential therapeutic target. This strategy has led to the discovery of many antiangiogenic agents. However long lasting treatments might affect normal endothelial cells. For instance the inhibition of the kinase activity of VEGFR2 induces pulmonary emphysema. Thus the elucidation of the functions mediated by a single factor requires the preparation of circulating agonists in order to inhibit only those which are not functional in the normal vasculature.",

Estrogen exposure of endothelial cells that do not express VEGF induced a dose-dependent increase of VEGF expression and a mitogenic effect, which was abolished by a neutralizing antiVEGF antibody. In contrast, any antiFGF2 neutralizing antibody was inefficient in E2-stimulated endothelial cell proliferation. We examined if an increase in VEGF bioavailability might be sufficient to allow the tumor take. When ovariectomized mice did not receive an estrogen pellet, they did not develop tumors whether they had been challenged with antiidiotypic antibodies or not. Similarly VEGF 165 -transfected MCF-7 cells did not develop tumors in the absence of estrogen whereas when estrogen was present their doubling time was even lower (5 days) than those growing in AId-V or AId-F2 challenged mice. Thus, although in vitro experiments have clearly shown that VEGF or estrogen stimulates the expression of VEGFR2, neither constitutive expression of VEGF in MCF-7 cells nor systemic activation of VEGFR2 could circumvent estrogen ablation. This indicates that VEGFR2 and FGFR1 are not functional in skin vessels in which the tumor vascularization occurs. Taken together, these data suggest that the permissive effect of estrogen on tumor angiogenesis resulted from the release by MCF-7 cells of soluble factors which would induce a phenotypic switch of dermal endothelial cells into tumor endothelial cells.",

New antitumor therapies based on the premise that inhibiting angiogenesis suppresses tumor growth are currently being tested in clinical trials. Angiogenesis is a multi-stage process that involves the release and activation of angiogenic factors, endothelial cell migration and proliferation, and differentiation into newly formed capillaries. The neovasculature of diseases with an angiogenic component differentially expresses many cell surface receptors in the endothelium. Identification of novel molecules characteristic of angiogenic vasculature by techniques such as in vivo phage display will improve our understanding of the plasticity of the activated endothelial phenotype and suggest new therapeutic strategies. Thus far, identification and isolation of such molecules has been slow, in large part because endothelium-derived cells undergo marked phenotypical changes when grown in culture. Angiogenic vasculature is an appealing target for cancer therapy since it is composed of non-malignant cells; such endothelium-derived cells are genetically stable and presumably less prone to acquire drug resistance. Targeting angiogenic blood vessels has other advantages such as an improved accessibility to the drug, and an intrinsic amplification mechanism. The idea of therapy directed at angiogenic vasculature has been proposed for more than a decade but its impact has not yet been fully realized. However, an intense effort is currently underway for the development of antiangiogenic strategies because of the fact that solid tumors cannot progress without new blood vessels.",

It is tempting to speculate that bacteriophage -prokaryotic viruses -may use the same cellular receptors of eukaryotic viruses.

In view of this homology we have called this gene MR. Roundabout is an axon repulsion mediator whose cognate ligand is slit [8, 9] . A homologue called frazzled acts as an axon attractor in response to its ligand netrin. The receptors are completely neuronal specific and modular, that is the extracellular domain recognises the ligand but the intracellular domain determines the neuronal response and they are interchangeable. The true protein product of MR is likely to be larger than the 417 aa coded in the AK000805 clone since the open reading frame has no apparent up-stream limit, and size comparison to human roundabout 1 (1651 aa) suggests a much larger protein. This has recently been confirmed by 5\u00a2 RACE analysis.",

They inhibit the growth of cultured endothelial cells at nanomolar or greater potency, but are inactive against most other cell lines at concentrations less than several micromolar. Selectivity for endothelial lines is not absolute, however, as recently a few non-endothelial cell lines have been found to be inhibited by nanomolar concentrations of fumagillin. Thus, although the cellular mechanism of fumagillin is not completely understood, it is characterised by inhibition of DNA synthesis (late G1 block) and by expression or activation of various cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases. Cell strain-selective transcriptional effects are considered to be the ultimate step in the cell biology of fumagillin-like compounds. TNP-470 inhibits angiogenesis in vivo, and has demonstrated anti-tumour activity in several animal models.

A second part of the study reported that among various methionine aminopeptidase-engineered yeast strains evaluated for sensitivity to fumagillin, only a deletion strain lacking the type 1 enzyme (DmetAp1) was inhibited. This finding is consistent with the inability of fumagillin to inhibit MetAp1 and with lethality of the double mutant (redundancy of function of type 1 and type 2 enzymes). Taken together, these biochemical and genetic data strongly indicate that fumagillin inhibits MetAp2 in yeast, leading to growth inhibition and ultimately to the death of the organism.

Biochemical and biological data have established two important correlations, however, in the case of mammalian cells. First, limited structure-activity data based on TNP-470 show a correlation between MetAp2 inhibition and anti-proliferative activity. Second, TNP-470 inhibits endothelial cell proliferation and fumagillin-MetAp2 binding with the same dose dependence.

Two attempts to explore the relationship between MetAp2 inhibition and biological effect have recently been described. Proteomics methodology has been employed to determine critical substrates of MetAp2 in cells by subtractive analysis (cells \u00b1 fumagillin) of proteins subjected to two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. Several proteins were identified which appeared to be altered as anticipated under conditions of MetAp2 inhibition, but none had any obvious relevance to the DNA/cell cycle effects of fumagillin. A second approach, based on an early observation that TNP-470 inhibits activation of cyclin dependent kinases, led to the finding that this fumagillin analogue induces p53 activation and expression of p21 CIP/WAF , a natural inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases. These inductions are reportedly specific for endothelial cells, providing a possible explanation for selective anti-angiogenic activity of fumagillin and related compounds. A clear relationship between this effect and MetAp2 inhibition is not evident from these data, however, and it is necessary to postulate that an event downstream of MetAp2 action is cell-type dependent and favors p53 activation and cell cycle blockade in endothelial cells. Additional studies of this sort should lead to a clearer understanding of the operation of fumagillin-like compounds on their target MetAp2 in a cellular setting.",

Current efforts are aimed at identifying such inhibitors and exploring the cellular consequences of MetAp2 inhibition to find the molecular basis of its link with angiogenesis. Ginseng has been reported both to suppress the growth of new blood vessels in tumours, and conversely to promote angiogenesis during wound healing. To resolve this apparent contradiction, we have been studying pure ginsenosides extracted from Panax ginseng for their modulatory effects on angiogenesis. In an in vitro wounding assay, two ginsenosides induced a concentration-dependent proliferation of serum-starved human umbilical vein endothelial cells. In a mouse sponge-granuloma model, one of these ginsenosides produced a marked angiogenic response. Further studies will focus on the angiogenic or antiangiogenic activities of pure ginsenosides and their molecular mechanisms of action, with a view to develop novel ginsenoside derivatives for the appropriate treatments of angiogenic diseases. The recently discovered Angiopoietins join the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) family as the only known growth factor families largely specific for vascular endothelial cells.

While the hypervascularity formed in the presence of excess VEGF is leaky and fragile (and associated with tissue edema and hemmorhage), vessels made in the presence of excess Angiopoietin-1 are actually resistant to vascular leak induced by VEGF or inflammatory mediators. Correcting an imbalance towards excess VEGF seen in many pathologic states, by either blocking the excess VEGF or administering additional Angiopoietin-1, could decrease plasma leakage and the resulting edema and thus have important clinical benefit in numerous disease settings, including diabetic retinopathy, tumor-associated ascites, brain edema associated with tumors or ischemic stroke, as well as in arthritis and other inflammatory conditions.",

Development of a potential therapeutic we term our 'VEGF Trap', which is perhaps the most potent VEGF antagonist described and can completely block tumor angiogenesis and endothelial proliferation, has allowed us to conclusively demonstrate that tumors can indeed grow invasively by vessel cooption in the absence of angiogenesis or endothelial proliferation; tumor growth is however limited by using the VEGF Trap to block new angiogenesis. In addition to regulating vessel formation and survival, the balance between VEGF and Angiopoietins seems to regulate the function and quality of tumor vessels, e.g., tumor vessels are often subject to excess VEGF and are thus leaky and fragile (and associated with tissue edema and hemmorhage), due to relative lack of the vessel stabilization, maturation and anti-permeability functions provided by Angiopoietin-1. In addition, Angiopoietin-2 and EphrinB2 are dramatically induced in tumor vessels, providing perhaps the best early markers of coopted or angiogenic tumor vessels, and thus targets of anti-angiogenesis approaches.",

Encouragingly, consistent with the proposed anti-angiogenic mechanism, a prototype compound was found to be active in all human tumour xenograft models tested (n = 9). Comparison of a series of compounds revealed that the best anti-tumour activity correlated with sustained blood levels of drug. This indicates that sustained inhibition of VEGF signalling is required \u00c0 at least in a rapidly growing xenograft model. ZD4190 [2] was selected from this group of compounds for clinical development. ZD4190 is a potent (IC50 0.05 lM) inhibitor of KDR TK activity and VEGF signalling in human umbilical vein endothelial cells but only has direct effects on endothelial and tumour cell proliferation at much higher concentrations (>10 lM). In xenograft models, ZD4190 was significantly active (50 mg/kg/day) against all tumours tested and was well tolerated during chronic dosing (28 days). In all cases, tumours were established (0.5 cm 3 ) before dosing was commenced. In one particularly aggressive xenograft, PC3, sustained inhibition of growth has been demonstrated with daily dosing of ZD4190 for 10 weeks. In line with expectations, when therapy was withdrawn tumour growth resumed at the normal rate after a short delay. Acute effects of ZD4190 on tumour vascular permeability have also been demonstrated using gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging [3] .",

Most of the research effort has been focused on antiangiogenic therapy. Many agents are currently undergoing clinical evaluation and even more are at the preclinical development phase. These agents target one or more of the key processes involved in angiogenesis e.g. endothelial cell proliferation, migration, and basement membrane degradation. Such agents can prevent the growth of new blood vessels but will have little or no effect on the vasculature already preexisting in the tumour at the time treatment commences. As a result, recently there has been an increased interest in developing agents, which irreversibly damage the already formed neovasculature in tumours.

These effects have been observed in spontaneous as well as transplanted tumour models. More recently ongoing clinical studies have demonstrated that tumour blood flow reductions are also seen in humans following administration of CA4P. Although the mechanisms responsible for these effects have not been completely defined it has been shown that CA4P induces rapid shape changes in proliferating endothelial cells in culture. The fact that these changes occur over a similar time course to that seen with blood flow effects in vivo and that quiescent endothelial cells are much more resistant to such changes provides further evidence that this process is a key component in its action. These selective effects on cell shape reflect the critical role the tubulin cytoskeleton plays in maintenance of the elongated shape of endothelial cells when they are newly formed. Whilst a change in cell shape is not critical event for many cellular functions for an endothelial cell in a vessel such a change can result in rapid alterations in vessel function.",

In addition CA4P has a more rapid distribution and terminal half life in the plasma. These two factors reduced drug exposure to critical tissues and reversibility of action will minimise the antiproliferative efects of CA4P.

These cells and the stimulus from the localised hypoxia induced as a result of the ischemia result in continued growth and revascularisation. The most effective strategy to eliminate these remaining cells is to combine CA4P with conventional radiation and cytotoxic treatments.

Several studies in experimental tumours have estabished that NO synthase inhibitors can significantly enhance the activity of CA4P.

            "text": "Another major consideration in the potential use of anti-angiogenic drugs in the treatment of cancer is what therapeutic approach should be adopted. Four possibilities are immediately apparent (1) the adjuvant situation, (2) as a single agent therapy, (3) combination therapy together with, for example, conventional cytotoxics or radiotherapy and (4) in prevention of what has been termed 'incipient angiogenesis'. Combination therapy is most likely to be the first application of anti-angiogenic drugs. Examples of these approaches will be discussed and the case put forward for 'optimal therapy' involving use of an anti-angiogenic in combination with low dose chemotherapy. While use of anti-angiogenics in oncology clearly leads the field and is likely to do so in the foreseeable future, the use of anti angiogenics in other pathologies will be considered. This will aim to highlight the advantages as well as the pitfalls of such an approach. Methionine aminopeptidase-2 (MAP2) is inhibited by fumagillin, a natural product that inhibits growth of endothelial cells. Fumagillin has anti-angiogenic activity in vivo, presumably owing to selective MAP2 inhibition. TNP-470, a fumagillin derivative, is in phase II clinical trial. Evidence of cellular action of fumagillin on MAP2 was found in both yeast and cultured mammalian cells. Deletion of the related enzyme methionine aminopeptidase-1 (MAP1) sensitized yeast to fumagillin, while episomal overexpression of yeast wt MAP2 in a chromosomal Dmap1 strain reversed sensitization. Expression of human MAP1 afforded full resistance, indicating complementation of yeast MAP1 function. To link MAP2 to fumagillin action in mammalian cells, murine melanoma (B16F10) cells, which like endothelial cells are sensitive to pM-nM concentrations of fumagillin, were transfected with a plasmid carrying a CMV promoter driving human MAP2 and a gene for G418 resistance. Colonies selected in 500\u00c0800 nM G418 were isolated and evaluated for fumagillin sensitivity after 72 h. Growth inhibition curves of most G418-resistant clones were rightward-shifted. The amount of shift varied depending on the clone and is currently being correlated with MAP2 content by western blotting. These results suggest that MAP2 is a functionally relevant target of fumagillin in mammalian cells and that overexpression of the protein renders yeast and mammalian cells resistant to fumagillin. Angiogenesis, an essential component of wound healing is regulated by angiogenic growth factors. Our aims were to: (a) determine in normal and wounded gastric mucosa expression of VEGF, bFGF, Ang1, Ang2 and their temporal and spatial relationship; and (b) to characterize ultrastructural features of angiogenesis in wounded gastric mucosa in vivo. Methods: Ninety rats received intragastrically 8 ml/kg of 50% ethanol or saline (placebo) and gastric samples were obtained 3, 6, 24, 48 and 72 h after injury. Studies: (1) quantification of angiogenesis with videoimage analysis system; (2) VEGF, bFGF, Ang1 and Ang2, mRNAs by quantitative RT/PCR and proteins by Western blotting and immunohistochemistry; and (3) transmission EM. Results: Twenty-four hours after injury, 81% of microvessels in the mucosa bordering necrosis demonstrated endothelial sprouting, formation of microvascular tubes and ultimately microvessels reconstruction by 48\u00c072 h. Mucosal injury triggered a significant overexpression of VEGF, bFGF, Ang2 and Ang1 mRNAs and proteins in the mucosa bordering necrosis (VEGF 385%\u00c0630% with peak at 3 h; bFGF 220%\u00c0310% with peaks at 6\u00c024 h; Ang2 and Ang1 220%\u00c0390% with peaks at 6\u00c024 h; all P < 0.001. Increased signal for bFGF and Ang2 co-localized with VEGF in sprouting microvascular tubes. Conclusions: (1) Gastric injury triggers angiogenesis in mucosa bordering necrosis. (2) Angiogenesis is preceded by overexpression of VEGF mRNA and protein, bFGF, Ang2 and Ang1 mRNAs and proteins, respectively. (3) Co-localization of VEGF, Ang1, Ang2 and bFGF suggests their local interactions in a temporally and spatially ordered manner. Ulcer healing is critically dependent on angiogenesis. We have previously shown that gastric wounding triggers activation of VEGF and angiopoietin 1 (Ang1) genes. We studied whether single injection of naked DNA encoding for (a) VEGF, (b) Ang1 or (c) a + b affects healing of gastric ulcers. Methods: Gastric ulcers were induced in rats and 1 h later 100 g of plasmid DNA encoding for cDNA of either rhVEGF 165 , rhAng1 (both myc and 6xHis epitope tagged), combination of both, or control plasmid were injected into the submucosa around the ulcer. In some groups VEGF neutralizing antibody was injected i.v. 2 and 4 days after ulcer induction. Gastric specimens were obtained at 2, 7 and 14 days. Results: At 14 days in groups receiving plasmids encoding rhVEGF 165 or rhAng1, ulcer healing was accelerated by >400%, and >190% vs. control plasmid (P < 0.001). Healing was preceded by a significant increase in angiogenesis in granulation tissue at 7 days, by 72% and 280%, respectively (P < 0.005); correlation between enhanced angiogenesis and ulcer healing was: r = 0.99. In group injected with rhVEGF plasmid, VEGF 165 neutralizing antibody blocked angiogenesis and reversed acceleration of ulcer healing (by 26 AE 18%). Coinjection of rhVEGF + rhAng1 plasmids improved quality of ulcer healing and microvessel maturation. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is the major regulator of vasculogenesis and angiogenesis through VEGF receptors 1 and 2 [1] . VEGF receptor-3 (VEGFR-3) binds VEGF-C and VEGF-D and it is required for normal cardiovascular development during embryogenesis. In adult tissues, VEGFR-3 expression becomes restricted mainly to the lymphatic endothelium. We have cloned and analyzed the human VEGFR-3 gene and characterized missense mutations affecting the receptor signaling function in patients with hereditary lymphedema [2\u00c04]. All disease linked mutant VEGFR-3 alleles analyzed encoded a tyrosine kinase negative protein. According to our studies, the mutant receptor interferes with the wildtype receptor signaling, and the turnover time of the mutant receptor is longer than that of the wild-type receptor, leading to accumulation of the mutant receptor on the cell surface. These phenomena lead to reduced VEGFR-3 signaling and hypoplasia of the subcutaneous lymphatic vessels in lymphedema patients. Our results establish the importance of VEGFR-3 in normal lymphatic development and mutations in VEGFR-3 as a cause of primary lymphedema. We also have developed a mouse model for lymphedema, with one inactive VEGFR-3 allele. Like human patients, these mice show a reduced number of lymphatic vessels in the skin. This mouse model now allows us to study the possible treatments for lymphedema with VEGFR-3 as a target.",

            "text": "Although it is well known that regular contractile activity induces an increased capillarisation in skeletal muscle, little is known about the regulation of angiogenesis in this tissue. Several growth factors may be involved in the angiogenic process, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). Furthermore prostaglandins and adenosine, two naturally secreted vasodilators in contracting skeletal muscle, have been shown to stimulate proliferation of endothelial cells. To investigate whether prostaglandins and adenosine regulate VEGF and bFGF gene expression in skeletal muscle tissue, we added 0.1 mg/ml indomethacin (a cyclooxygenase inhibitor) and 50 lM AOPCP (a 5\u00a2nucleotidase inhibitor) to primary skeletal muscle cells and endothelial cells in culture. Northern blot analysis of the skeletal muscle cells and endothelial cells revealed the existence of VEGF and bFGF mRNA in both cell types. Densitomeric mRNA/GAPDH levels for VEGF in skeletal muscle cells were increased 3-fold after 2 h and 6-fold after 26 h of indomethacin treatment compared to muscle cells with no inhibitor added (P < 0.05). Addition of indomethacin to endothelial cells increased VEGF mRNA levels 3.5-fold after 48 h (P < 0.05). Addition of indomethacin to skeletal muscle or endothelial cells did not have an effect on bFGF mRNA levels in either cell type. Inhibition of 5\u00a2nucleotidase in skeletal muscle and endothelial cells did not alter VEGF or bFGF mRNA/GAPDH levels. These results indicate that prostaglandins reduce VEGF mRNA in skeletal muscle cells and endothelial cells but not bFGF mRNA levels, whereas adenosine does not appear to regulate VEGF or bFGF mRNA levels in these cell types. Supported by the Danish National Research Foundation (504-14). In this stimulating study, we tested the mitogenic activity of VEGF on bovine retinal microvascular endothelial cells (BRMECs) by BRMECs with different VEGF concentrations (0\u00c0200 ng/ml). Our results demonstrate that VEGF stimulates the proliferation of BRMECs in a concentration-dependent manner. VEGF can promote BRMEC proliferation at 1\u00c05 ng/ml VEGF and above 50 ng/ml, while proliferation was significantly less at the intermediate concentrations. Immunoblotting analysis revealed that the VEGF did not cause a dose-dependent change in KDR receptor expression. However, while exogenous VEGF induced tyrosine phosphorylation of KDR it was significantly reduced at 20 ng/ml VEGF. This was associated with an increase in SH-PTP1 (a membrane associated protein tyrosine phosphatase) and eNOS when BRMECs were exposed to 10 and 20 ng/ml VEGF. Immunoprecipitation and selective immunoblotting demonstrated that activation of KDR by VEGF enhances SH-PTP1 activity and eNOS expression, which in turn lead to two diverse events: one is that SH-PTP1 dephosphorylates KDR which weakens VEGF mitogenic activity, the other is that eNOS increases NO production, which in turn lowers SH-PTP1 activity via S-nitrosylation. Our results demonstrate a complex association between different membrane proteins which is highly dependent on VEGF concentration. Tissue graft regeneration relies on the formation of new blood vessels (angiogenesis) for the supply of essential nutrients and removal of waste products. The angiogenesis process is regulated by a variety of growth factors, including the most potent vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). To enhance the vascularization of tissue-engineered implants following their implantation to replace a failing organ, our group has developed 3D alginate scaffolds containing controlled delivery microspheres of VEGF or bFGF. The composite scaffolds were characterized a highly porous structure, wherein the microspheres were evenly distributed throughout the scaffold. In vitro, the composite scaffolds released the growth factors over a month. In vivo, following implantation into rat peritoneum, the released VEGF or bFGF significantly enhanced the rate and the extent of blood vessel formation within the composites, as compared to control composites without growth factors. Histological cross-sections of the composite alginate scaffolds, 21 days after implantation, revealed that the VEGF or bFGF composites contained 70 capillaries per square millimetre, while the control composites contained only 20 capillaries per square millimetre. The enhanced vascularization should contribute to biograft viability and integration into the host. Endostatin (22 kDa) is a C-proteolytic fragment of collagen XVIII, localized in vascular basement membrane zones of various organs. It is an inhibitor of angiogenesis and tumor growth, and it binds heparin and heparan sulfate, which are complex sulfated polysaccharides. Endostatin might inhibit angiogenesis by binding to the heparan sulfate proteoglycans of the cell surface, which are involved in growth factor signaling. The aim of this work is to study the interaction between endostatin and heparin by surface plasmon resonance and to characterize the structural features of the heparin sequence involved in endostatin binding. Recombinant human endostatin produced by 293 EBNA cells bound immobilized heparin with an affinity constant in the micromolar range. The binding was strongly inhibited by heparin and dermatan sulfate (97% and 49% inhibition, respectively). Heparan sulfate was a very weak inhibitor (12% inhibition), and chondroitin sulfate did not inhibit the binding. Heparin oligosaccharides also inhibited the interaction. The inhibition increased with increased oligosaccharide length (10% for a hexasaccharide up to 80% for a hexadecasaccharide). The minimal size required for endostatin binding seems to be a dodecasaccharide (57% inhibition). Protection assays are in progress to determine the sequence of heparin involved in the binding, together with competition experiments to determine if endostatin binding to heparin prevents the binding of FGF-2 and thus interferes with the angiogenic activity of this growth factor. Mediators of extracellular matrix protein degradation, the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) involved in inflammation, angiogenesis and wound healing, are interesting targets for neuroprotection. Recent data reported an activation of MMP2 (gelatinase A) and MMP9 (gelatinase B) after cerebral ischemia and spinal cord injury (SCI). The present study uses in situ zymography to locate at cellular level the gelatinase activity in a rat spinal cord closed contusion model. The kinetic of gelatinase activation was monitored by in situ zymography on 20 lm cryostat sections. The spinal sections were incubated overnight with fluorescein-quenched DQ gelatin (25 lg/ml). The gelatin digestion yielded cleaved fluorescent peptides enabling the detection of gelatinolytic activity at cellular level. A strong gelatinase activity was detected 24 and 48 h after injury, at the lesion site in and around vascular structures, infiltrated cells and neurons. After a week and up to 2 months, the gelatinolytic activity was associated with a fibrous scar at the lesion epicentre and with longitudinally oriented blood vessels penetrating the lesion from both stumps and cells located in the necrotic area. The present data suggest that spontaneous tissue repair following spinal cord contusion includes a rapid neovascularisation of the necrotic zone by longitudinally oriented growing blood vessels, followed by the regrowth of nerve fibres, including supraspinal fibres, along the same axis. We conclude that revascularisation gives rise to a supportive matrix for nerve regeneration and permits the ingrowth of nerve fibres at the lesion site. The present findings indicate that a combination of substances can reduce MMP activity and stimulate angiogenesis to promote the neuritic extension may provide a new therapeutical approach for the treatment of SCI.",

            "text": "It is becoming increasingly clear that alternative mRNA splicing represents an important cellular control mechanism. A recent publication estimated that at least 35% of disease-associated genes are alternatively spliced [1] . The importance of alternative splicing in the field of angiogenesis is exemplified by a number of genes including the hypoxia-induced factor-1a (HIF-1a), fibroblast growth factor receptor-1 (FGFR1), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and VEGF-receptor 1 (VEGF-R1, FLT-1). Exonhit Therapeutics SA has developed an innovative approach to qualitative genome analysis that allows the identification of alterations in mRNA splicing, using its gene profiling technology DATAS (Differential Analysis of Transcripts with Alternative Splicing). DATAS allows the isolation of a library of alternatively spliced sequences associated with specific disease states. This is achieved through isolation of mRNA from two cellular populations (for example angiogenic and non-angiogenic tumour material), followed by reverse transcription to generate cDNA. Heteroduplexes between mRNA from one population and cDNA from the other population are allowed to form and are isolated. RNase H treatment is then used to release mRNA that does not hybridise to the heteroduplex. This RNA, which encodes the alternative splice event, can then be isolated, reverse transcribed into cDNA and cloned. Thus, a library of alternatively spliced mRNA sequences for a given condition can be isolated. DATAS has been applied to in vivo and in vitro hypoxic and angiogenic model systems in order to obtain a library of alternatively sliced clones associated with angiogenesis. This angiogenic library contains genes involved in early signal transduction events, cell survival and metabolic adaptation. Validation of the library has been performed and demonstrated that both alternative spliced and differentially expressed angiogenic sequences are present. This library, therefore, provides a powerful tool for the characterisation of alternative splicing during angiogenesis and offers a route for the identification of new anti-angiogenic drug targets.

By covalenty attaching RGD peptides to a protein backbone, macromolecular conjugates were produced that are expected to exert a long circulation time in the body and enable the attachment of multiple effector molecules. The aim of this study was to analyze the biodistribution of these conjugates in tumor-bearing mice. Methods: An avb3 directed RGD peptide was chemically coupled to a protein backbone at peptide:protein ratios 2:1, 5:1, 10:1 and 25:1. Binding of the resulting conjugates to endothelial cells was analyzed by flow cytometry and by using an avb3-mediated endothelial cell adhesion assay. Furthermore, the biodistribution of the RGD conjugates was studied in tumor-bearing mice using radiolabeled conjugates and immunohistochemistry. For this latter purpose, we developed a polyclonal rabbit antibody specific for the RGD-peptide conjugated to the protein backbone. Results: Binding of the RGD conjugates to endothelial cells was dose-dependent and dependent on the number of peptide molecules per protein backbone. The conjugates were furthermore still able to inhibit the adhesion of endothelial cells to avb3 ligand vitronectin. In vivo studies revealed that all RGD conjugates localized in the tumor. Moreover, this localization appeared to be endothelium specific. Furthermore, the RGD conjugates were also present in liver, kidney and spleen in various cell types. Discussion: Coupling of RGD peptide to a protein backbone resulted in conjugates with specificity for interaction with the avb3 integrin on endothelial cells. The conjugates appeared to localize in the tumor vasculature. However, the localization in other organs needs further investigation into the cellular distribution patterns in these organs as well as the quantitative comparison of tumor vasculature vs. non-tumor distribution. The effects of attachment of effector molecules to the RGD-protein conjugates will furthermore be studied in relation to anti-tumor activity and toxicity elsewhere in the body. Biomedical research is entering the post-HUGO era. Many predicted ORFs/cDNAs can be extracted from the genome sequence, but definitely not every single ORF/cDNA, let alone splice variants. The search for novel proteins and their function is the next logical step in the quest for a complete understanding of the biology of the cell and the organism. At Galapagos, we have constructed an arrayed adenoviral expression library (PhenoSelect library) derived from placenta. By screening the PhenoSelect library in a number of high through-put assays, we want to assign novel functions to both known and previously unidentified genes.",

These assays study endothelial cell proliferation and capillary formation, two key processes during angiogenesis. To select for secreted proteins, we infect producer cells (HeLa cells) with the adenoviruses of our PhenoSelect library and then transfer the resulting conditioned medium to the assay plate containing the target cells (HUVEC). If an angiogenic growth factor is present in the conditioned medium, this factor will, depending on the assay, induce either proliferation or capillary formation. Currently we are screening the first 10,000 viruses from our PhenoSelect library in the HUVEC proliferation and capillary formation assay. Resulting hits will be evaluated in endothelial cell migration assays, expression studies and in animal models. Endothelial cells (EC) are exposed to an acidic environment in a variety of pathological and physiological conditions. We have previously shown [1] that hypercarbic acidosis (pH 7.0) inhibits EC proliferation and protects EC from serum deprivation-induced apoptosis. In order to characterize the mechanism(s) involved in this process, a cDNA array screening was performed on human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) cultured in a medium with 2% fetal calf serum at pH 7.4 or 7.0. After 6 h at pH 7.0 tyrosine kinase receptor Axl expression was enhanced 3.3-fold as compared to pH 7.4. This modulation was further confirmed by RT-PCR (3 AE 0.9-fold; P < 0.03), Northern (3.6 AE 0.1-fold; P < 0.0003) and Western blot (10 AE 1.8-fold; P < 0.004). In a 48-h time course study the highest induction was achieved between 24\u00c048 h. Northern blot analysis showed that the ligand of Axl, the survival factor growth arrest specific gene 6 (GAS-6), was also enhanced about 2-fold, after 48 h at pH 7.0. Functional analyses demonstrated that full length Axl cDNA overexpression reduced serum deprivation-induced apoptosis in HUVEC cultured at pH 7.4 by 69.4 AE 7% (P < 0.0001), compared to mock transfected cells. Further, either overexpression of soluble Axl or antisense GAS-6 mRNA partially reverted the effect of acidosis to protect EC from apoptosis. These data suggest that the ligand-activated Axl pathway may play a role in EC survival during acidosis.",

Here we use gene expression analysis to find genes that are both relevant and unique to the angiogenic process as defined by an in vitro model. Analysis of the data identified 154 genes that are modulated during the process and 105 genes that enriched for expression in endothelial cells as compared to normal tissues. A subset of 39 genes was found to be common to both groups and of the 21 known genes found in this group, 16 genes have been associated with endothelial cell biology and/or angiogenesis. The identification of a5 integrin in the genes enriched for endothelial cell expression allowed us to further validate our approach. Thus, this study identified a small number of genes fitting defined biological hypotheses that can be assessed as therapeutic targets. Endostatin decreased VEGF-induced formation of endothelial tubes and microvessels sprouting from aortic rings and blocked their network. After cessation of treatment, the survival time of endostatin plus VEGF-treated tubes was approximately twice as long as that of tubes treated with VEGF alone. Endostatin antibody blocked VEGFinduced endothelial tube formation and disrupted existing tubes. Endostatin immunostaining was localized between endothelium and basement membrane, and in inter-endothelial junctions of new, but not of quiescent, blood vessels. In tumors grown in SCID mice, endostatin immunostaining was strongest when the blood vessels involved were undergoing maturation and was significantly prominent in vessels of the tumor marginal zone, where angiogenesis is highly active. These data indicate a new antiangiogenic action of endostatin in the stabilizing and maturing endothelial tubes of newly formed blood vessels. Thus, strategies accelerating vascular stabilization and maturation could be promising in tumor therapy.",

The pattern of VEGF immunoreactivity was not related with risk of tumour recurrence (P > 0.1). All papillary blood vessels were surrounded by a PAS and reticulin positive extracellular matrix; however, elastin (orcein stain) was never observed. These vessels were also positive for CD31 but none of the blood vessels observed were only positive for CD31. In our series, we did not observe any occurrence of neoangiogenesis or necrosis. Conclusions: According to our results, papillary blood vessels network in superficial urothelial bladder cancer is formed by capillaries and venules and represent an adequate vascular system. Expression of VEGF is one of the characteristics of these tumours and may play a role in the development and maintenance of papillary vascular network",

            "title": "Sweden It has been previously shown that, in the presence of an intact endothelium, low shear stress (SS) enhances and high SS inhibits artery wall thickening. The mechanism(s) responsible for this modulatory effect of SS are poorly characterized. In the present study we analysed the effects of conditioned media (CM) from bovine aortic endothelial cells (BAEC) exposed to laminar SS of 5 dyne/cm 2 (SS5) or 15 dyne/cm 2 (SS15), for 16 h, on SMC migration. In a Boyden chamber assay SMC migration in response to CM from BAEC exposed to SS5 (CMSS5) and SS15 (CMSS15) was 45 AE 5.5 and 30 AE 1.5 cells/field, respectively (P < 0.05). PDGFAA levels in CMSS5 and CMSS15 were 9.2 AE 7 and 18 AE 5 ng/ml, respectively (P < 0.05); PDGFBB levels in CMSS5 and CMSS15 were 38 AE 10 and 53 AE 11 ng/ml, respectively P < 0.05). CMSS15 induced phosphorylation of both PDGF receptor a (PDGFRa) and b (PDGFRb) on SMC. In the presence of CMSS15, neutralizing antibody anti-PDGFAA enhanced SMC migration to a level comparable to that of CMSS5; in contrast antibodies anti-PDGFBB abolished SMC migration. SMC transfection with dominant negative (dn) PDGFRa increased SMC migration in response to CMSS15 (P < 0.001), whereas overexpression of either dnPDGFRb or inactive PDGFRb mutants markedly reduced SMC migration in response to CMSS5, CMSS15 or recombinant PDGFBB. Overexpression of wild type PDGFRa inhibited SMC migration in response to CMSS5, CMSS15 or recombinant PDGFBB. In summary, lower SMC migration in response to CM from BAEC exposed to high vs. low SS is due, at least in part, to PDGFRa-mediated inhibition of PDGFRb-dependent SMC migration",

Endoglin, a receptor for some members in the TGF-b family, is expressed on proliferating endothelial cells and may be a useful marker of ongoing angiogenesis. Immunohistochemical staining of endoglin and von Willebrand factor was examined in 72 cases of prostate cancer. Micro-vessels were counted in the most vascularized fields, on hot spots. Double staining for smooth muscle actin and endoglin or von Willebrand factor, respectively, was performed in order to evaluate vessel maturation. Endoglin stained tumour vessels were generally small, and only 14% were double stained with actin. The double staining for actin and von Willebrand factor was 38%. The endoglin and von Willebrand factor vascular counts were correlated and both were prognostic for clinical outcome. The median survival times were shorter for patients with tumours containing vascular counts above median than for patients with vascular counts below median (4 vs. 12 years, P = 0.0007, and 5 vs. 10 years, P = 0.018, respectively). The endoglin vascular count was correlated with Gleason grade, tumour stage, metastasis, tumour cell immunoreactivity for TGF-b1, and tumour cell proliferation index, while the von Willebrand factor vascular count was correlated with Gleason grade and TGF-b1 immunoreactivity",

In ex vivo aortic ring cultures b3-deficient rings responded to exogenous VEGF with increased microvessel sprouting when compared to controls, implicating an increase in VEGF-receptor function. Since both avb3 and avb5-integrins are vitronectin receptors and there is evidence that avb5 is a receptor for VEGF, it was necessary to examine a possible compensatory role of b5-integrin. Interestingly, endothelial cells isolated from knockout mice were deficient for b3-integrin, but had normal expression levels and function of all other integrins tested. In contrast, Western blot and FACS analysis of endothelial cells established a 2-fold increase of the VEGF receptor Flk-1 in b3-deficient cells. Furthermore, reintroduction of b3 into knockout cells reduced Flk-1 expression to wild-type levels. Taken together these data demonstrate that b3-integrin deficiency enhances angiogenesis and that b3-integrin is involved in Flk-1 downregulation.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) inhibit angiogenesis in vivo and in vitro, but the molecular mechanisms are not fully explained. This study was aimed to determine in rat aortic endothelial and in HUVEC cells whether a nonselective NSAID, indomethacin (INDO) affects bFGF-induced angiogenesis, endothelial cell proliferation and expression of the cell cycle regulatory proteins. Methods: Rat aortic endothelial cells and HUVEC were cultured with and without INDO (0.1\u00c00.5 mM) for 16 h. Then, vehicle or bFGF 1\u00c010 ng/ml were added for 3\u00c0 48 h. Studies: (1) in vitro angiogenesis; (2) cell proliferation with 3 H-thymidine uptake; (3) expression of: (a) cyclins D 1 and E; (b) cyclin kinase inhibitors (CKIs) p21 and p27; and (c) pRb phosphorylation. Results: INDO inhibited angiogenesis in vitro by 9-folds (P < 0.001); reduced endothelial cell proliferation (both at baseline, and bFGF-stimulated) by 7\u00c015-folds (P < 0.001) at each study time (3\u00c048 h), significantly inhibited bFGFactivated cyclin D 1 protein expression (>163% inhibition; P < 0.001), increased baseline and bFGF-activated CKI p21 (but not p27) expression by >98% (P < 0.001), and abolished bFGF-induced pRb phosphorylation. Conclusions: (1) indomethacin dramatically inhibits in vitro angiogenesis and endothelial cell proliferation; (2) the latter action is mediated by INDO-induced interference with cyclin D 1 , pRb phosphorylation and by activation of CKI p21. 4 Single local injection of VEGF and angiopoietin-1 DNAs dramatically accelerates gastric ulcer healing and improves quality of scar M.K.

            "text": "During wound healing, angiogenesis and the remodelling of the extracellular matrix are stimulated through local production of several growth factors, and specific cytokines (such as VEGF) play an important role in the stimulation of wound healing. The effects of boron on wound healing have been studied, and it has been demonstrated clinically that boron greatly improves the healing of deep wounds with tissue loss. The aim of our study was to determine the mechanisms implicated in the wound healing under the effects of boron. By using different models, we have investigated the action of boron on the formation and turnover of extracellular matrix, and found that it modulates the formation of extracellular matrix by increasing the release of its components, such as proteoglycans and the protease activity (collagenase, cathepsin D). We also investigated the boric acid effect on the expression of angiogenic factor VEGF, and we show that more VEFG is synthesized in the assay (with boric acid) than in the control (without boric acid). By conclusion, the effects of boron in the wound healing could be explained, in part, by its action on the extracellular matrix and by the stimulation of VEGF release. Tumour necrosis factor is a cytokine, which has, alone or in combination with IFN-c and/or chemotherapeutic agents, a powerful anticancer effect in cancer patients as well as in animal models. Its potentially lethal shockinducing effect, however, limits its application to loco-regional treatment. We could previously show, e.g. by selectively inhibiting the hemodynamic shock with methylene blue [1] , that both effects are not inevitably linked. In order to selectively mimic its antitumour effects through downstream molecules and/or targets, we have studied its in vivo mechanisms of action. Using histological analysis, TNF and IFN-c of different species and muteins thereof, transfected tumour cells and various knockout mice, we show that host-mediated effects are the major and necessary effects of the antitumour activity. The effectiveness of the treatment correlated with apoptosis of endothelial cells, which was observed in the tumour vasculature but not in the normal vasculature. Also the observed synergism between low dosed systemic TNF and Stealth\u00e4\u00c0liposome encapsulated doxorubicin is due to host-mediated effects, most probably on the tumour vasculature.Angiogenesis has been associated with many life-threatening pathologies, including tumor progression, diabetic retinopathies, haemangiomas, arthritis, arteriosclerosis, psoriasis, etc. The recognition of the involvement of angiogenesis in major disease states has been accompanied by an increased interest in research involved in identifying and developing angiogenesis inhibitors. One of the main objectives of our work is to carry out a high throughput screening for angiogenesis modulators. As a source of compounds, we use extracts and fermentation broths derived from marine organisms, and supplied by Instituto Biomar S.A. (Le\u00f3 n, Spain). Active compounds are selected by means of a number of in vitro and in vivo assays resembling angiogenesis processes. After purification and structure elucidation, the new active compounds are patented. The searching strategies and some results of our screening program will be presented.",

            "text": "Monoclonal anti-idiotypic antibodies targeting VEGF receptors The demonstration of tumor progression angiogenesis has led to the development of new anti-angiogenic cancer therapies. Our laboratory has developed an anti-idiotypic strategy to construct circulating agonists of angiogenic growth-factor receptors. The specificity of these anti-idiotypic antibodies (AId Abs) is very useful for analysing the intracellular signals and the differentiation effects mediated by each receptor. In a previous work, we demonstrated that polyclonal VEGF AId Abs could behave as circulating agonists for VEGF-R2. These AId Abs were able to stimulate endothelial cell proliferation in vitro and tumor angiogenesis in vivo. They also blocked tumor progression when coupled to a cytotoxic compound. We report the production of monoclonal AId Abs for VEGF by fusing the myeloma and splenocytes from mice primed with anti-VEGF antibodies. Antiboby specificity has been determined by ELISA and SPRIA on the extracellular domains of VEGFR1 and VEGFR2. Specific agonists of VEGFR2 induced endothelial cell proliferation but not migration in the nanomolar range. These antibodies also stimulate tumor progression in syngeneic mouse models. We are currently coupling these AId Abs to a toxin in order to determine their potential anti-angiogenic activity. This work should result in the development of a new class of anti-angiogenic agents.",
