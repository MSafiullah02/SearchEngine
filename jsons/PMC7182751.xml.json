When the viral particle enters the cell, an endosome is formed, which has an acidic pH of 5. The proton channel (viroporin) is formed by the transport protein M2, which carries protons into the virion. This proton pump is necessary to interrupt the macromolecular interactions that keep the integrity of the virion. Amantadine is able to cross the membrane of the endosome and breaks the hydrogen bridges formed by Ala 30 and Gly 34 [4] in that way it can capture protons preventing them from entering the virion, preventing the release of the viral nucleus into the cell.
