            "text": "Muscle weakness is a frequent problem in the intensive care unit (ICU). The weakness can be due to primary neuromuscular disorders that trigger the need for intensive care, such as Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 Syndrome, myasthenia gravis, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or multiple sclerosis, among others, but these conditions only account for < 0.5% of all ICU admissions [1]. More often, however, muscle weakness develops as a secondary disorder while patients are being treated for other life-threatening conditions. The latter has been labeled \u201cICU-acquired weakness\u201d with the implication that this neuromuscular dysfunction has no plausible etiology other than the critical illness and its treatments [2]. ICU-acquired weakness is typically generalized, symmetrical, and affects limb (proximal more than distal) and respiratory muscles, whereas facial and ocular muscles are spared [3, 4]. Muscle tone is almost invariably reduced. Deep tendon reflexes can be reduced or normal. Weakness may originate from a neurogenic disturbance \u201ccritical illness polyneuropathy\u201d (CIP), a myogenic disturbance \u201ccritical illness myopathy\u201d (CIM), or a combination thereof labelled \u201ccritical illness neuromyopathy\u201d [2, 5, 6]. Electrophysiological examination shows typical patterns of abnormalities. Also, the pronounced loss of muscle mass, that can exceed 10% over the 1st week in ICU, has been associated with functional impairment [7, 8]. Severe disuse muscle atrophy has been put forward as a separate entity of ICU-acquired weakness in the absence of electrophysiological abnormalities [4].",

This inherently implies a volitional technique, which has the drawback that the patients must be awake and cooperative and must comprehend the assessor\u2019s instructions. As patients are often unconscious or uncooperative, due to sedation or delirium, such clinical diagnosis is often not possible or is delayed. The most widely used volitional technique is the 6-grade Medical Research Council (MRC) sum score [2, 3, 21, 22]. This score yields a global estimation of motor function, pointing to clinically relevant muscle weakness when below 48 and severe muscle weakness when below 36 [11, 41]. However, differentiation in the higher range is difficult. A modified 4-grade score showed better inter-rater agreement for diagnosing ICU-acquired weakness than the classical 6-grade score [23], but requires further validation. The ordinal scale of the MRC sum score limits the sensitivity to detect more subtle changes in muscle function. In contrast, hand-held dynamometry for measuring handgrip and quadriceps strength provides a continuous quantitative measure, but representativeness for global muscle strength has been questioned [3, 21, 23, 24]. The \u201cScored Physical Function in Intensive Care Test\u201d, \u201cFunctional Status Score for the ICU\u201d and \u201cChelsea Critical Care Physical Assessment Tool\u201d provide information about the patients\u2019 functional abilities, but are less commonly used [25\u201327]. Finally, the 6-minute walking distance (6-MWD) assesses functional capacity, but is rather used to evaluate how patients perform at discharge and in post-ICU follow-up [27\u201329].",

Single nerve conduction studies have shown promise as alternative for time-consuming full electrophysiological studies [22, 31, 32]. For differential diagnosis of CIP and CIM in uncooperative patients, direct muscle stimulation shows normal muscle excitability in CIP and reduced muscle excitability in CIM.

Of these, ultrasonography is considered most promising [30, 33]. Although ultrasonography allows quick and repeated bedside evaluation of measures of muscle quantity and quality, it may underestimate muscle and protein loss [4, 30, 33, 34]. Furthermore, interpretation of the available studies is complicated by significant methodological defects, small sample sizes, and lack of standardization to control for operator dependency [30, 33]. The clinical relevance also remains to be determined [22, 35]. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging can accurately and reliably detect infiltration of muscle by adipose tissue and quantify fat-free muscle mass, but are expensive, require specialized staff and software, and are logistically challenging [30, 33]. Furthermore, computed tomography exposes patients to a high level of radiation. Several of these limitations also apply to dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry and neutron activation analysis that assess body composition [33]. Bioelectrical impedance measurements also assess body composition, but results are affected by edema, skin temperature and positioning [33].",

Thus, a higher severity of illness score, sepsis and inflammation, multiple organ failure, as well as a longer duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU stay, were found to be predictive [11, 43\u201345]. In fact, ICU-acquired weakness is most frequent in patients with persistent critical illness [46]. The relationship with mechanical ventilation could be reciprocal given that prolonged ventilation increases the risk of ICU-acquired weakness and diaphragmatic dysfunction which, vice versa, increase the risk of prolonged ventilation and failed weaning [13]. Another illness-related risk factor is a high lactate level [45]. Further, a higher risk of weakness may apply to women than to men, and to older as compared with younger patients [11, 43, 45]. Also, premorbid disability and frailty may predispose to the severity of weakness. Intriguingly, premorbid obesity was found to be an independent protective factor against development of ICU-acquired weakness and against muscle atrophy [47].",

For example, dose and duration of vasoactive medications, mostly \u03b2-agonists, are associated with a higher risk of ICU-acquired weakness [44]. In meta-analyses, the use of corticosteroids has been associated with risk of ICU-acquired weakness in heterogeneous patient populations [52] and when focusing exclusively on patients with sepsis [53]. However, one study suggested a protective effect of corticosteroids when hyperglycemia as a side effect was avoided [49]. The reported adverse relationship between the use of neuromuscular blocking agents (NMBAs) and muscle weakness remains uncertain [45, 54, 55]. An RCT comparing 48-h infusion of cisatracurium with placebo, both under deep sedation, in ARDS patients did not observe a significant impact [56]. However, a 48-h infusion of cisatracurium with concomitant deep sedation tended to increase the risk of ICU-acquired weakness as compared with absence of routine neuromuscular blockade and lighter sedation targets, with significance reached for weakness present on day 28, but not for weakness present on day 7 or at any time through day 28 [57]. Also, when co-administered with corticosteroids or infused for > 48 h, NMBAs may promote weakness [54]. Certain antibiotics, including aminoglycosides and vancomycin, have also been independently associated with ICU-acquired weakness [45, 58]. The association between sedatives and weakness may be indirect, as separating effects of sedatives from those of sedation-induced immobility and bed rest is difficult [62]. Continued sedation is thought to have a more pronounced effect on muscle atrophy and weakness than when a patient is conscious but immobile in the absence of sedation [9].",

This association has mostly been documented for limb muscle weakness [14]. It has also been observed for diaphragm dysfunction, but not unequivocally [14, 65]. Limb and respiratory muscle weakness have further been identified as independent predictors of prolonged need of mechanical ventilation [66, 67]. Limb muscle weakness at extubation was independently associated with higher extubation failure rates in medical patients [68]. Among predominantly surgical patients with limb muscle weakness, 80% also showed diaphragmatic dysfunction [69]. Extubation failed in 50% of them, with need for reintubation within 72 h, among whom 50% died in ICU. Muscle weakness has also been associated with a longer duration of ICU and hospital stay and with increased in-hospital costs [14, 70, 71]. Neuromuscular weakness has further been suggested as a key mechanism contributing to ICU-acquired swallowing disorders, including post-extubation dysphagia [72]. Weakness of the abdominal muscles can impair effective cough [3].",

Strikingly, the likelihood of late death was further increased when weakness persisted until ICU discharge, and even more so for patients with a more severe degree of persistent weakness (MRC sum score < 36, Fig. 4c). An independent association with higher one-year mortality was also found for a reduced compound muscle action potential (CMAP) on ICU day 8, irrespective of clinical weakness diagnosed by the MRC sum score [42], and for respiratory muscle weakness evidenced by a low maximal inspiratory pressure [73]. Even a mild reduction in muscle strength not yet meeting the threshold of clinically relevant weakness (lower raw MRC sum score, but MRC sum score \u2264 55 being most predictive) and nerve/muscle dysfunction (abnormal CMAP) at ICU discharge have recently been independently associated with a worse five-year survival [77].

However, even 5 years after ICU discharge, patients still experienced varying degrees of weakness and reduced walk and exercise ability [81]. New functional disabilities in activities of daily living also can persist for at least 8 years after sepsis [82]. A large heterogeneous cohort of critically ill patients showed lower handgrip force, shorter 6-MWD and reduced physical quality of life 5 years after ICU admission [78]. A small study observed reduced maximal voluntary contraction, rate of force development and endurance time 1 year after ICU discharge, but no signs of neural impairment [83]. Importantly, the acquisition of weakness in the ICU appeared to be a major independent determinant of long-term weakness, other morbidities and poor quality of life after ICU discharge [75, 76]. Weakness at ICU discharge, even if mild and not yet considered as clinically relevant, has recently been independently associated with lower handgrip force, lower respiratory muscle strength, lower 6-MWD and lower physical quality of life with lower physical independence 5 years later (MRC sum score \u2264 55 being most predictive), unlike an abnormal CMAP [77]. Interestingly, evaluation of patients 1 year after ICU discharge suggested that a myogenic origin of ICU-acquired weakness had a better prognosis with virtually full recovery as compared with a neuromyogenic origin that left 50\u201375% of the patients with persisting muscle weakness or even tetraparesis [84, 85].

Muscle proteolysis, autophagy, inflammation and mitochondrial content had normalized, but patients with sustained atrophy showed less satellite cells, which may impair regenerative capacity. Co-expressed genes associated with the degree of muscle weakness and atrophy showed enrichment in genes involved in skeletal muscle regeneration and extracellular matrix deposition [87].

Nevertheless, strictly targeting fasting normoglycemia in surgical and medical ICU patients reduced the risk of developing electrophysiological signs of critical illness polyneuromyopathy [48, 49]. Achieving normoglycemia, rather than the administration of insulin, explained this lower risk.

            "text": "The severe caloric deficit that arises from critical illness-associated anorexia and gastrointestinal dysfunction has been associated with muscle atrophy and weakness [93]. Muscle atrophy has long been regarded a major myogenic component of muscle weakness. Based on observational studies and expert opinion, to prevent muscle atrophy nutritional guidelines hence advocated early full nutrition, preferentially via the enteral route but otherwise supplemented via the parenteral route [94]. Major emphasis was put on giving enough protein as substrate for building muscle mass. However, large RCTs showed lack of benefit or even harm by early full nutrition and hence no longer support such aggressive feeding strategies. Indeed, supplementing insufficient enteral nutrition with early parenteral nutrition to caloric targets increased complications and delayed recovery of critically ill adults and children as compared with accepting the macronutrient deficit by withholding parenteral nutrition in the 1st week in ICU [28, 95]. Harm evoked by early parenteral nutrition comprised more ICU-acquired weakness and impaired recovery thereof, longer dependency on mechanical ventilation and a longer stay in the ICU [20, 28, 95]. Early parenteral nutrition to caloric targets also did not reduce muscle atrophy [20]. Macronutrient doses, and not the route of administration, explained the harm. More specifically, the early administration of amino acids, but not glucose or lipids, appeared to be the culprit [96, 97]. Rather than being used for synthesis of muscle proteins, the amino acids appeared to be largely broken down and shuttled to ureagenesis, possibly explaining the lack of benefit in RCTs investigating increased amino acid supplementation [97\u2013100]. Amino acids also suppress autophagy in muscle, which has shown to be a mechanism contributing to ICU-acquired weakness [20]. Importantly, in these studies, micronutrients were infused in recommended doses in both groups to avoid deficiencies [28, 95] that have also been linked to muscle weakness, among other complications of critical illness [101]. In another RCT, also early full enteral feeding was unable to improve impaired physical function 1 year after ICU admission as compared with early hypocaloric feeding [102]. Further research is needed to establish the ideal timing of initiation beyond the 1st week, optimal dose and composition of artificial nutrition for critically ill patients [93].",

Such interventions evidently require a policy to minimize sedation [3, 9]. Interestingly, daily interruption of sedative infusions was shown to reduce the duration of mechanical ventilation and of ICU dependency [104]. Several modes of (early) mobilization and rehabilitation have been evaluated, but showed inconsistent results. Although several systematic reviews and meta-analyses concluded in favor of this intervention, a low quality of evidence was pointed out [105\u2013109]. Tipping et al. concluded that active mobilization and rehabilitation improved muscle strength at ICU discharge, enhanced the probability of walking without assistance at hospital discharge and resulted in more days alive and out of hospital to day 180 [105]. High dose rehabilitation in the ICU was further suggested to improve some aspects of quality of life at 6 months. A more recent analysis concluded that early rehabilitation improved only short-term physical-related outcomes with low quality of evidence for a decreased risk of ICU-acquired weakness as compared with standard care or no early rehabilitation [106]. Other systematic reviews that compared early mobilization and/or active exercise with delayed exercise emphasized the low quality of evidence in favor of early intervention, given the small sample sizes of these studies, heterogeneity of studied interventions and outcomes, high risk of performance bias, high dropout rates, and inadequate descriptions of usual care [107, 108]. Methodological limitations also explained the low confidence in the observed associations of the improved inspiratory and expiratory muscle strength after inspiratory muscle training with shorter ventilator dependency [109]. However, several additional studies are ongoing which hopefully will shed light on the efficacy of early mobilization and rehabilitation.",

Prevention seems at least in part possible, as avoiding hyperglycemia and postponing parenteral nutrition to beyond the 1st week in ICU, have been shown to reduce the burden of ICU-acquired weakness. Also early mobilization, which requires minimizing sedation, may be promising but several ongoing studies are awaited for to further clarify its impact on clinically relevant outcome measures. Further research is required to design new preventive and/or therapeutic strategies that can be tested in adequately powered RCTs. Based on animal studies [103], a first interesting candidate to explore could be the infusion of ketone bodies or strategies to activate ketogenesis.",

Patients who died were censored after the last patient had been weaned alive, discharged alive from the ICU or discharged alive from the hospital, respectively. Plots were redrawn in JMP\u00aePro14.0.0 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) from the data described in [70]. Hazard ratios and 95% confidence intervals below 1, for the effect of weakness versus no weakness, illustrate a lower chance of earlier live weaning, of earlier live ICU discharge and of earlier live hospital discharge for patients with as compared with patients without ICU-acquired weakness. b Medians, interquartile ranges and 10th and 90th percentiles of 6-min walking distance at hospital discharge and total billed costs, as well as the distribution of the discharge destination, are shown for well-matched long-stay patients (ICU stay > 7 days) with (MRC < 48 at first evaluation) and without ICU-acquired weakness (MRC \u2265 48 at first evaluation), illustrating worse acute morbidity and higher healthcare-related costs for weak patients, as reported in [70]. c One-year survival for matched long-stay patients (ICU stay > 7 days) with (MRC < 48 at first evaluation) and without ICU-acquired weakness (MRC \u2265 48 at first evaluation) are shown (left panel), together with Cox regression estimates for one-year survival for all long-stay patients with ICU-acquired weakness according to whether weakness persisted until final examination in the ICU or not (middle and right panel). The survival curves visually display the model predicted survival time for the \u201caverage\u201d patient according to the Medical Research Council (MRC) sum score at final examination in the ICU as described in [70]. The middle panel compares patients who recovered from weakness (MRC \u2265 48 at last evaluation) with all patients who did not (MRC < 48 at last evaluation), whereas the right panel further distinguishes persistently weak patients into patients who remained moderately weak (MRC 36\u201347) or severely weak (MRC < 36). One-year survival was lower for weak patients as compared with not-weak patients. Survival was further lowered when weakness persisted and was more severe as compared with recovery of weakness at ICU discharge. d Five-year survival is shown for patients according to MRC sum score at final examination in the ICU > 55 versus \u2264 55 (left panel), according to normal or abnormal CMAP on day 8 \u00b1 1 (middle panel), or according to the combined information of the MRC sum score at final examination in the ICU > 55 or \u2264 55 and normal or abnormal CMAP on day 8 \u00b1 1 (right panel) (adapted from [77]).
