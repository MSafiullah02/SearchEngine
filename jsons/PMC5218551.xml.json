To reduce the circulation of RSV, identifying which groups are responsible for majority of the infections is critical. Transmission potential can be estimated by a combination of mixing patterns\n9 and virus shedding (viral density and duration). Human experimental infection with RSV reported that volunteers inoculated with a higher dose of virus (4.7 log\n10 tissue culture infectious dose (TCID)\n50 of RSV A2) were more likely to be infected than those given low doses of the inoculum (3.7 log\n10 TCID\n50 of RSV A2)\n10, suggesting that individuals who shed more virus are likely to be more infectious. Determining quantities shed and the related underlying factors, will help in predicting the spread of infection in a population and identify key groups to target for infection control. Previous studies have used the duration of shedding to identify individuals with the greatest potential for infection spread\n11, based on the assumption that they have a higher number of infectious contacts. Several studies report on the duration of RSV shedding with mean values ranging from 4.5 to 11.2 days\n12,\n13. In addition to variation in assay type, determinants included history of RSV infection\n12, age, infection severity, detection of other viruses before and during the RSV infection, and presence of concurrent RSV infections in the same household\n13. These studies and others\n14,\n15 do not account for the temporal changes in quantity of virus shed. Experimental RSV infection studies indicate that an individual infection episode begins with low viral shedding, which rises with time as the virus continues to replicate within epithelial cells and finally declines as the infection clears\n16.",

The details of the study have been described elsewhere\n13,\n17,\n18. In summary, throughout an RSV season spanning 26 weeks (December 2009\u2013June 2010), nasopharyngeal swabs (NPS) were collected by trained field assistants every 3\u20134 days, irrespective of symptoms, from 47 RSV na\u00efve infants and their household members. Households were selected through the Kilifi Health and Demographic Surveillance System (KHDSS) and local community health workers and were considered eligible if they had a child born after 1\nst April 2009. The infants were assumed to be RSV na\u00efve because they were born after the 2008/2009 RSV season. A total of 16928 NPS collections were tested for RSV (groups A and B) and other prevalent respiratory viruses (adenoviruses, rhinoviruses and human coronaviruses (NL63, 229E and OC43)) using multiplex real time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay as previously described\n19. As PCR cycles proceed the quantity of product detected rises and at some point passes through a user assigned threshold for detection (set at the point of observable exponential rise in product), known as the cycle threshold (Ct). The earlier (lower) the Ct value the higher the starting concentration of target sequence (equated with viral density). As a cut-off, samples with Ct values of 35.0 and below were considered positive. An RSV infection episode was defined as the period within which an individual provided specimens which were PCR positive for the same infecting RSV group with no more than 14 days separating any two positive samples. A household outbreak was defined as a period in which a household experienced more than one individual infection episode, without there being more than 14 days between any two infection episodes. A primary/index case was a person first identified to have an RSV infection leading to a household outbreak. A first episode was the first episode in that season that an individual had while a subsequent episode was a second or third episode that a person may have had during the follow up. Virus test results, recorded in Ct values, were converted to log\n10 ribonucleic acid (RNA) copy numbers (direct measure of viral density) to enable plotting of the time \u2013 concentration curve. The equation\ny = -3.308x + 42.9 was used to convert Ct values (y), to their log\n10 RNA equivalents (x), as a way of quantifying RNA\n20. The converted values are hereafter referred to as viral densities. Amount of virus shed during an infection episode was estimated by calculating the area under the time-concentration curve (AUC) using the trapezoidal rule\n21, with units of copies * days. The peak viral density for each episode was identified as the highest measured viral density in an infection episode.",

RRID:SCR_000432). The differences in the distribution of amount of virus by various characteristics was tested using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test and Kruskal Wallis test as appropriate. Spearman's rank correlation coefficient was used to find the association between the different measures of viral quantity calculated. Linear regression was used to identify the main factors associated with the amount of virus shed, i.e. AUC. Possible covariates were chosen from the dataset by selecting those that could plausibly be associated with AUC. A univariable analysis was carried out to identify factors associated with AUC. All variables with a p-value of <0.1 in the univariable analysis were included in the multivariable regression analysis. The final multivariable regression model was developed by a backward elimination procedure, removing variables with a p-value >0.05 in each step using likelihood ratio tests. Risk factors were removed in descending order of strength of association determined from the multivariable analysis. Two interactions were tested in the multivariable model. An interaction between age and symptom status was tested to determine if the effect of age on the amount of virus shed varied by symptom status. An interaction between age and primary/secondary case status was also tested because it was suspected that the effect of age on the amount of virus shed could vary by primary/secondary case status.

Young age at infection, presence of respiratory symptoms, intra-household acquisition of infection, being a first infection episode in the season for an individual, and having a co-infection were associated with increased amounts of RSV shed. The majority of virus available for transmission during an RSV epidemic appears to arise from individuals in their first year of life and therefore undergoing their first RSV infection episode (since all were born after the preceding RSV epidemic). Household size did not influence the per person amount of virus shed, and neither did the presence of a smoker in the household. In this rural community, indoor smoke from solid fuels (mainly firewood and charcoal) was ubiquitous and likely to conceal any specific effects of cigarette smoke. In addition, we only had 18 smokers out of the 493 participants. So, relatively few people lived with smokers. Also, we did not collect data on contact patterns of household members with the smokers or if the smoker did smoke in the house or outside which could affect the level of exposure to smoke within the households. The apparent effect of school going status on amount of virus shed was confounded by age, as school was attended by young individuals, who in turn shed more virus. RSV viral densities appeared to be low for most individuals in the beginning of the season but increased well into the season. This was a reflection of the occurrence of the RSV epidemic. Viral densities for RSV B were first to increase followed by viral densities for RSV A. RSV B infections spread to more individuals probably due to earlier onset by chance compared to RSV A infections.",

Acquired immunity (following exposure to RSV) and physiological development of the airways with age have been linked with reduced risk of severe RSV disease\n12,\n13. We speculate that elderly individuals are more prone to infection because of their deteriorating immune response which could explain the higher amount of virus in individuals over 40 years, compared to other adults. However, this study cannot discriminate between the two factors of young age and a first infection as the dominant factors associated with shedding (infants all had first infections, and we do not know the history of previous infection in all other ages). Individuals with a co-infection of RSV group A and B shed twice the amount of virus compared to those infected with either RSV A or B only, suggesting that the physiological infection processes for two viruses might be independent (rather than competitive or synergistic). Similar patterns of shedding were reported based on shedding duration estimates using this dataset\n13 and others\n12,\n15. These findings can provide a hint to pathogenesis of RSV disease\n6. A recent experimental study has reported disease severity to be closely related to viral load\n16 even though another shows contrasting observations on disease severity and viral load link\n10. Our study showed a strong positive association between virus shedding and presence of respiratory symptoms. Symptomatic individualso shed higher amounts of virus than asymptomatic individuals irrespective of age. Overall those who were both young (<5 years) and symptomatic contributed to the highest amount of virus shed (51.8%). Using amount of virus as a correlate of infectiousness, these two factors are associated with virus spread within the community and in families and thus have direct implications in design and delivery of transmission-blocking interventions such as vaccines.",

            "text": "This analysis had some limitations. First, the nasal samples were collected with intervals of 3 to 4 days hence a complete profile of the viral density changes over time could not be captured. This has implications on the accuracy of our AUC estimates. However we minimize this by using a conservative approach providing three possible estimates i.e. minimum, midpoint and maximum estimates as detailed in the\nSupplementary Material. Furthermore, the three measures were strongly correlated and their variations by various characteristics such as age and symptoms, were comparable. Second, Ct values were converted to RNA copies using published associations\n20 hence providing only a relative measure of virus density in the sample taken rather than absolute values of the amount of virus shed. Using the inverse of the Ct values as a measure of viral load did not change the distribution of AUC by various characteristics or any conclusions made from the results. There are no published studies using our approach in a community setting to facilitate comparison. Our approach takes into account both changing viral load and the duration of shedding making it more robust. However, its accuracy also relies on user selected thresholds for measures of viral load, and this could result in some differences in findings across studies. A quantitative PCR would be preferable. Third, there is inherent variability in estimated viral load due to variation (both biological and methodological) in the amount of virus collected using a nasopharyngeal swab. Deep NPS collections might have a higher density than perinasal swabs but events prior to sampling, e.g. sneezing, might introduce variations in sample quality. However this is likely to be non-systematic hence only conservatively affects our final conclusions. Finally, the assumption is made that virus density as measured by PCR is a measure of infectious virus. The most likely limitation of this assumption is over-estimating the duration of and peak shedding of viable virus. Generally, the relationship between the measures of viral shedding and infectiousness to other people are unknown. In the current analysis we took logarithms of estimated viral densities, under the general assumption that the risk of transmission will saturate at higher viral shedding. We then integrated over this logarithmic measure to obtain a measure of total infectiousness. An alternative would be to have integrated over the untransformed viral density, and then taken logarithms prior to statistical analysis. This approach did not give substantially different results. Estimation of the functional relationship between viral shedding and transmission is being considered in on-going analysis of the epidemics observed within households.",

However, it is also evident that individuals with similar durations of shedding may shed different amounts of virus. Individuals with a combination of high viral density and long shedding durations are likely to shed the most virus. This improves on existing literature that measures infectiousness using the duration of shedding only. The groups that are most likely to spread infection are individuals with a first infection episode, the symptomatic, and most predominantly, the young, which has implications on which groups to target for vaccination in RSV prevention strategies.",
