While the interdependences, similarities and complementarities of manufacturing and services are significant, there are considerable differences between goods and services, including the shift in focus from mass production to mass customization (whereby a service is produced and delivered in response to a customer's stated or imputed needs). In general, services can be considered to be knowledge-intensive agents or components which work together as providers and consumers to create or co-produce value.",

Integration must occur over the physical, temporal, organizational and functional dimensions, and must include methods concerned with the component, the management, and the system. Moreover, an effective service system must also be an adaptable system, leading to greater value and responsiveness. Adaptation must occur over the dimensions of monitoring, feedback, cybernetics and learning, and must include methods concerned with space, time, and system. In sum, service systems are indeed complex, especially due to the uncertainties associated with the human-centered aspects of such systems. Moreover, the system complexities can only be dealt with methods that enhance system integration and adaptation. The paper concludes with several insights, including a plea to shift the current misplaced focus on developing a science or discipline for services to further developing a systems engineering approach to services, an approach based on the integration and adaptation of a host of sciences or disciplines (e.g., physics, mathematics, statistics, psychology, sociology, etc.). In fact, what is required is a services-related transdisciplinary -beyond a single disciplinary -ontology or taxonomy as a basis for disciplinary integration and adaptation.",

The first -mechanical -stage focuses on agriculture and mining (i.e., living off of the land, air and sea); it seeks to enhance farming productivity, employs mechanical tools that have product life cycles on the order of decades, depends mostly on muscle power, embraces a living standard concerned with subsistence, and is limited in its scope of economic influenceprimarily impacting the family or immediate locale. The second -electrical -stage focuses on manufacturing and construction (i.e., creating and producing goods and structures); it seeks to enhance factory productivity, employs electromechanical machines that have product life cycles on the order of years, depends on both muscle and brain power, embraces a living standard concerned with the quality of goods, and is broader in its scope of economic influence -impacting the region or nation. The thirdinformation -stage focuses on services (i.e., creating and delivering added value that is essentially intangible); it seeks to enhance information (i.e., processed data) productivity, employs information (including communications) technologies that have service life cycles on the order of months, depends mostly on brain power, embraces a living standard concerned with the quality of life, and is global in its scope of economic influence. More recently, the words \"experience economy\" (e.g., tourism, Starbuck coffees, space station visits, etc.) have been employed to underscore the quality of life focus of this third stage in a nation's economic evolution. In general, every nation has gone or will go through these three stages of economic evolution: today, the underdeveloped nations are still at the mechanical stage; most of the developed nations are at the electrical stage; while the economically advanced nations are at the service stage. Interestingly, the U.S. has seen the onset of each new stage every 100 years or so: in the late 1700s for the mechanical stage, in the late 1800s for the electrical stage, and in the late 1900s for the information stage. On the other hand, while some countries -like China -have been slow in moving from the mechanical to the electrical stage, they have since been moving",

First, it is interesting to note that in regard to customization and in relation to the late 1700s, the U.S. is in some respects going \"back-to-the-future\"; thus, advanced technologies are not only empowering the individual but are also allowing for individualized or customized goods and services.For example, e-education reflects a return to individual-centered learning(Tien 2000), much like home schooling in a previous century.",

A critical by-product of collaboration is, of course, standardization. Standards establish clear boundaries of function and operation, eliminate data interface problems, define interchangeable components and platforms, and assure a high level of performance. In turn, a cornerstone of standardization has been the ubiquitous bar code -called the Universal Product Code (UPC)that has been uniquely associated with almost every good or service. The UPC is making way for the Electronic Product Code (EPC) which, as noted earlier, is stored in a radio frequency location and identification (RFLID) tag or computer chip with a transmitter.",

            "text": "connectivity of system entities refers to the progressive linking and testing of system components to merge their functional and technical characteristics into a comprehensive, interoperable system of systems (SoS). For example, in a fully integrated SoS, each system can communicate and interact with the entire SoS, without any compatibility issues. For this purpose, an SoS needs a common language, without which the SoS components cannot be fully functional in the sense that new system components cannot be appropriately integrated into the SoS without a major effort. The concept of an SoS arises from the need to more effectively and efficiently implement and analyze large, complex, and heterogeneous systems working in a cooperative and interdependent manner. The driving force behind the desire to view these systems as an SoS is to achieve higher capabilities and performance than would be possible with the components as stand-alone systems. Sadly, however, the same advances that have enhanced interconnectedness have created new vulnerabilities, especially related to equipment failure, human error, weather and other natural disasters, and physical and cyber attacks. Thus, electronic viruses, biological agents and other toxic materials can turn a nation's \"lifelines\" into \"deathlines\" (Beroggi and Wallace 1995), in that they can be used to facilitate the spread of these materials -whether by accident or by willful act. Even the Internet -with over a billion users -has become a terrorist tool; jihad websites are recruiting members, soliciting funds, and promoting violence (e.g., by showing the beheading of hostages). Thus, the tools or technologies that underpin a modern society can likewise serve as weapons for undermining, if not destroying, society. Biological, chemical and nuclear advances can be employed as weapons of mass destruction; the highly effective Internet can be a medium for cyber viruses, hackers and spammers; and airplanes can be employed as missiles against people, infrastructures and commerce.",

            "text": "decision making. To begin, it is helpful to underscore the difference between data and information, especially from a decision making perspective. Data represent basic transactions captured during operations, while information represents processed data (e.g., derivations, groupings, patterns, etc.). Clearly, except for simple operational decisions, decision making at the tactical or higher levels requires, at a minimum, appropriate information or processed data. Figure 1 also identifies knowledge as processed information (together with experiences, beliefs, values, cultures, etc.), and wisdom as processed knowledge (together with insights, theories, etc.). Thus, strategic decisions can be made with knowledge, while systemic decisions can be made with wisdom. Unfortunately, for the most part, the literature does not distinguish between data and information; indeed, economists claim that because of the astounding growth in information -really, data -technology, the U. S. and other developed countries are now a part of the global \"knowledge economy\". Although electronic data technology has transformed large-scale information systems from being the \"glue\" that holds the various units of an organization together to being the strategic asset that provides the organization with its competitive advantage, the U. S. is far from being in a knowledge economy. In a continuum of data, information, System System adaptation: lower case decision informatics paradigm knowledge, and wisdom, the U. S. -as well as other advanced economies -is, at best, at the beginning of a data rich, information poor (DRIP) conundrum, as identified in Section 1. The fact remains that data -both quantitative and qualitative -need to be effectively and efficiently fused and analyzed in order to yield appropriate information for informed or intelligent decision making in regard to the design, production and delivery of goods and services. As depicted in Figure 2, the nature of the required real-time decision (regarding the production and/or delivery of a service) determines, where appropriate and from a systems engineering perspective, the data to be collected (possibly, from multiple, non-homogeneous sources) and the real-time fusion and analysis to be undertaken to obtain the needed information for input to the modeling effort which, in turn, provides the knowledge to identify and support the required decision in a timely manner. Clearly, methods must be developed that can fuse and analyze a steady stream of non-homogeneous (i.e., quantitative and qualitative) data. The feedback loops in industrial engineering. At present, decision modeling methods suffer from two shortcomings. First, most of the availableespecially optimization -methods are only applicable in a steady state environment, whereas in the real-world, all systems are in transition. (Note that steady state, like average, is an analytical concept that allows for a tractable, if not manageable, analysis.) Second, most of the available methods are unable to cope with changing circumstances; instead, we need methods that are adaptive so that decisions can be made in real-time. Thus, non steady-state and adaptive decision methods are required. More importantly, real-time decision modeling is not just about speeding up the models and solution algorithms; it, like real-time data fusion and analysis, also requires additional research and development.",

Another critical aspect of systems engineering is system performance; it provides an essential framework for assessing the decisions made -in terms of such issues as satisfaction, convenience, privacy, security, equity, quality, productivity, safety and reliability. Similarly, undertaking systems engineering within a real-time environment will require additional thought and research. A final point about Figure 2: the depicted decision informatics paradigm is, as a framework, generic and applicable to most, if not all, decision problems. In fact, since any data analysis or modeling effort should only be undertaken in support of some kind of a decision (including the design of a good or a service), all analyses and modeling activities should be able to be viewed within the decision informatics framework. Thus, the framework can be very appropriately applied to critical issues in regard to a particular service, good, or infrastructure system. The decision informatics approach is needed not only to develop new innovations \"design thinking\".) In short, decision informatics represents a decision-driven, information-based, real-time, continuouslyadaptive, customer-centric and computationallyintensive approach to intelligent decision making by humans and/or software agents. In regard to the three levels of decision making, strategic decisions are usually distinguished from tactical and operational decisions by the organizational and financial impact of the decisions (i.e., the impact of a strategic decision being significantly greater than those at the tactical and operational levels); by the 'clock speed' (i.e., major strategic decisions usually do not arise as often as tactical and operational decisions and the amount of time available for strategic decision making is usually greater than that for tactical and operational decision making, sometimes significantly so); and by the complexity or scope of the decisions (i.e., strategic decisions -in contrast to tactical and operational decisionsmust also take into consideration political, legal, social and ethical issues). At all three levels of decision making, it is not only about making the right decisions; it is also about making timely -all levels of decision making; on unstructured and complex problems; on qualitative and quantitative data; on soft and hard systems; on the integration of technical, institutional, cultural, financial and other inputs; on multiple conflicting objectives; and, quite appropriately, on a system of systems perspective. As one progresses from the operational to the strategic level of decision making, one tends to employ more societal system models and fewer physical system models. Human interface is another essential element of an adaptive service system; it is actually a critical tool in systems engineering. Such interface could include the interactions between and among humans and software agents, machines, sub-systems, and systems of systems. Human factors constitute a discipline that deals with many of these interactions. However, another critical interface concerns how humans interact with data and information. In developing appropriate human-information interfaces, one must pay careful attention to a number of factors. First, could lead to more effective decision making at all levels, from operational to tactical to strategic. Nevertheless, cognitive facilitation is especially necessary in operational settings which are under high stress. Third, cognitive modeling and decision making must combine machine learning technology with a priori knowledge in a probabilistic data mining framework to develop models of an individual's tasks, goals, and interests. These user-behavior models must be designed to adapt to the individual decision maker so as to promote better understanding of the needs and actions of the individual, including adversarial behaviors and intents.",

            "text": "cybernetic actions); that are known in a probabilistic or distributional manner (resulting in dynamic feedback or cybernetic actions); or that are unknown (resulting in adaptive feedback or cybernetic actions). As an example, autopilots -which are programmed to deal with deterministic and dynamic situations -can, for the most part, take off, fly and land a plane; yet, usually two human pilots are also on the plane, just in case an unknown state occurs and the adaptive judgment of a human pilot is required. Clearly, a trained human is still the most adaptive controller, although machines are becoming more 'intelligent' through adaptive learning algorithms. System control is perhaps the most critical challenge facing system of systems (SoS) designers. Due to the difficulty, if not impossibility, of developing a comprehensive SoS model, either analytically or through simulation, SoS control remains an open problem and is, of course, uniquely challenging for each application domain. Moreover, real-time control -which is required in almost all application domains -of interdependent systems poses an especially difficult problem. The cooperative control of a SoS assumes that it can be characterized by a set of interconnected systems or agents with a common goal. Classical techniques of control design, optimization and estimation could be used to create parallel architectures for, as an example, coordinating numerous sensors. However, many issues dealing with real-time cooperative control have not been addressed, even in non-SoS structures. For example, one issue concerns the control of an SoS in the presence of communication delays to and among the SoS sub-systems. Finally, learning adaptation can be defined by the degree of unstructured actions based on cognition (e.g., recognition-based, behavioral), evidence (e.g., information-based, genetic), and improvisation (e.g., experience-based, evolutionary). Learning adaptation is mostly about real-time decision making at the operational level. In such a situation and as indicated earlier, it is not just about speeding up steady-state models and their solution algorithms; in fact, steady-state models become irrelevant in real-time environments. In essence, it concerns reasoning under both uncertainty and severe time constraints. The development of operational decision support models must recognize several critical issues. First, in addition to defining what data to collect and how they should be fused and analyzed, decisions also drive what kind of models or simulations are needed. These operational models are, in turn, based on abstracted information unmanned aircrafts, and to determine sniper locations in modern day warfare (e.g., in Iraq). Third, computational improvisation is another operational modeling approach that can be employed when one cannot predict and plan for every possible contingency. (Indeed, much of what happened on 9/11 was improvised, based on the ingenuity of the responders.) Improvisation involves learning by re-examining and re-organizing past knowledge in time to meet the requirements of an unexpected situation; it may be conceptualized as a search and assembly problem, influenced by such factors as time available for planning, prevailing risk, and constraints imposed by prior decisions (Mendonca and Wallace 2004).",

            "text": "virtual). At all levels of decision making, there are a spectrum of possible models that can be utilized, ranging from those that can be regarded as supporting war games to those with avatars and virtual environments. The World Wide Web will soon be part of a World Wide Simulation where an immersive, three dimensional environment may well combine elements of such virtual worlds as Second Life with such mapping tools as Google Earth.Moreover, sight and sound will be complemented with virtual-touch technology or haptics, which can give users the sensation that they are feeling solid objects through tactile interfaces and physical resistance.Tien and Berg (2003) also call for viewing services as spatial systems that require integration and adaptation with other systems and processes; in fact, they make a case for further developing a branch of systems engineering called \"service systems engineering\". In this manner, they demonstrate how the traditional systems approach to analysis, control and optimization can be applied to a service system of systems that are each within the province of a distinct service provider. They underscore this special focus not only because of the size and importance of the services sector but also because of the unique opportunities that systems engineering can exploit in the design and joint production and delivery of services.In particular, a number of service systems engineering methods are identified to enhance the design and production/delivery of services,especially taking advantage of the unique features that characterize services -namely, services, especially emerging electronicservices, are decision-driven, information-based, customer-centric, computationally-intensive, and productivity-focused. Time adaptation methods include culture (e.g., attitudes, behaviors, expectations), technologies (e.g., autonomous, service-oriented architecture), and actions (e.g., informed, improvised). Autonomous control of a system assumes that it can be characterized by a set of 'intelligent entities' that can be implicitly or autonomously controlled. Although the concept of autonomous or intelligent control was first introduced three decades ago by Gupta et al. (1977), the control community has only recently paid substantial attention to such an approach, especially in regard to a variety of industrial applications (e.g., cameras, dishwashers, automobiles, etc.). Most of these applications are due to Zadeh (1996) and involve fuzzy logic, neural networks, evolutionary algorithms, and soft computing; the strength of these methods is in its ability to cope with imprecision, uncertainties and partial truth. Moreover, the methods can be used to process information, adapt to changing environmental conditions, and learn from the environment; thus, they are adaptive and, to a large extent, responsive to a data stream of real-time input. However, additional research is required before autonomous control can make full use of a continuous data stream, including taking into consideration the possible future state of a system of systems. Another critical e-service technology is the Global Positioning System (GPS); it is bringing significant productivity improvements to the world's transportation and emergency service (i.e., police, ambulance and fire) agencies, as well as to other dispatch-oriented industries (e.g., taxicab companies, delivery services, and maintenance services). Yet another technology is the ubiquitous Internet, the world's data superhighway in which businesses can interact with their far-flung offices, or with other businesses; customers can buy goods and services; and individuals can exchange e-mails or surf for information. Despite the \"dot-com bubble\" burst in the early 2000s, the Internet is flourishing and e-services or e-commerce is continuing to grow, especially as Web 2mobile devices a multi-purpose services instrument, with more memory and better screens and where traditional voice and data (i.e., Internet and email) services will converge with digital music, video clips, video conferencing, satellite radio, location tracking, traffic reporting, and other personal needs (e.g., credit checks, online education, etc.). All of these technological innovations -which are based on real-time computing -have ushered in a range of real-time or on-demand enterprises, which claim that critical business information is always up-to-date and available and that decisions can be promptly made; that is, the detection of an event, the reporting of that event, and the response decision can all occur within a very short time frame or near real-time. Clearly, as examples, the slow and inadequate responses to recent urban disruptions (e.g., 2001 9/11 tragedy, 2002 SARS -Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome -epidemic, 2004 South Asia Tsunami, and 2005 Hurricane Katrina) demonstrate that although real-time actions are desirable, they are not yet a pervasive reality. On the other hand, Amazon.com does employ real-time information technology and automated decision making to suggest alternative reading material for its customers. Thus, real-time decision making is not only about real-time computing but also about developing the tools or algorithms that can adaptively support real-time actions and activities.",

More specifically, since services are to a large extent subject to customer satisfaction and since, asTien and Cahn (1981) postulated and validated, \"satisfaction is a function of expectation,\" service performance or satisfaction can be enhanced through the effective \"management\" of expectation.Organizational integration can be defined by the degree of systems co-management of resources (e.g., people, processes, products), economics (e.g., supply, demand, revenue), and management (e.g., centralized, decentralized,distributed). In regard to management integration, Tien et al. (2004) provide a consistent approach to considering the management of both goods and services -by first defining a value chain and then showing how it can be partitioned into supply and demand chains, which, in turn, can be appropriately managed. Of course, the key purpose for the management of supply and demand chains is to smooth-out the peaks and valleys commonly seen in many supply and demand patterns, respectively. Moreover, real-time mass customization occurs when both supply and demand chains are simultaneously managed. The shift in focus from mass production to mass customization (whereby a service is produced and delivered in response to a customer's stated or imputed needs) is intended to provide superior value to customers by meeting their unique needs. It is in this area of customization -where customer involvement is not only at the goods design stage but also at the manufacturing or co-production stage -that services and manufacturing are merging in concept (Tien and Berg 2006), resulting in a \"servgood\". Functional integration can be defined by the degree of systems co-functioning in regard to input (e.g., location, allocation, re-allocation), process (e.g., informatics, feedback, control), and output (e.g., efficiency, effectiveness). From an output perspective, for example, it is obvious that a system should be about integrating and enhancing efficiency and effectiveness, the twin pillars of productivity. However, it should be noted that manufactured goods are primarily a result of an efficient supply chain, while services are primarily a result of an effective demand chain.",

The design process permits humans to employ the imaginative or \"right brain\" component of their intelligence in concert with their analytical or \"left brain\" capabilities to creatively solve, often in an iterative manner, tough problems, ranging from designing intelligent transportation systems to developing effective government policies. The information technology revolution has permitted the analysis part of design to be largely replaced by computers. For example, a human can tentatively imagine the main features of an advanced transportation vehicle having certain capabilities for satisfying transportation objectives; these features can then be rigorously analyzed and viewed graphically using a Computer Aided Design (CAD)/Computer Aided Manufacturing (CAM) program. Based on this analytical and visual feedback, the vehicle can be redesigned and analyzed again in an iterative manner until a satisfactory design is achieved which meets specified performance (e.g., human interface, environmental, fuel efficiency) criteria. Collaboration -especially inter-company collaboration -is perhaps the most surprising integration method. After all, patents were established to protect intellectual property, long enough for the inventors to recoup a good return on their creative investment. However, since services are, by necessity, co-created or co-produced, collaboration is essential.

In regard to the urban disruption set of examples, Tien (2005) demonstrates why adaptive decision making is critical when confronting such disruptions. While terrorist acts are the most insidious and onerous of all urban disruptions, it is obvious that there are many similarities in the way one should deal with these willful acts and those caused by natural and accidental incidents that have also resulted in adverse and severe consequences. However, there is one major and critical difference between terrorist acts and the other types of disruptions: the terrorist acts are willful -and therefore also adaptive. One must counter these acts with the same, if not more sophisticated, willful, adaptive and informed approach.

More importantly, it is shown that the combined, simultaneous real-time management of the two SCM and the two DCM yields a significantly more profitable outcome than the tandem application of these two sets of methods. Moreover, the real-time management approach required a more sophisticated solution approach than the traditional steady state approach. It is in this fourth, RTCM quadrant of Table 13 that both system integration (as reflected in the SCM methods) and system adaptation (as reflected in the DCM methods) are combined and dealt with simultaneously.

            "text": "A number of insights can be ascertained from an integrated and adaptive view of services. First, it is obvious that systems -especially service systems -are becoming increasingly more complex; indeed, each system can be regardedas a system of systems, together with all the attendant life-cycle design, human interface, and system integration and adaptation issues. For example, central to the mission of transforming the current U. S. army into a leaner, more technologically advanced fighting force is a vast computerized network -called the Future Combat Systems (FCS) -that would link humans (i.e., soldiers, commanders, etc.) to a panoply of sensors, satellites, robots, drones, and armored vehicles. Initiated in 2002, FCS has a projected price tag of $230 billion through 2030; it would require the writing of over 60 million lines of computer code, the most ever for any system. The Boeing Company and its main this very complex effort which, if successful, could change the nature of warfare and lift the proverbial fog of war from the battlefield. The decision informatics paradigm (Tien, 2003) must, of course, be at the heart of any FCS that requires adaptive, real-time decision making. Second, as real-time decisions must be made in an accelerated and co-produced manner, the human service provider will increasingly become a bottleneck; he/she must make way for a smart robot or software agent. For example, everyone could use a smart alter ego or agent which could analyze, and perhaps fuse, all the existing and incoming e-mails, phone calls, Web pages, news clips, and stock quotes, and assigns every item a priority based on the individual's preferences and observed behaviors. It should be able to perform an analysis of a message text, judge the sender-recipient relationships by examining an organizational chart and recall the urgency of the recipient's responses to previous messages from the same sender. To this, it might add information gathered by watching the user via a video camera or by scrutinizing his/her calendar. Most probably, such a smart agent would be based on a Bayesian statistical modelcapable of evaluating hundreds of user-related factors linked by probabilities, causes and effects in a vast web of contingent outcomeswhich can infer the likelihood that a given decision on the software's part would lead to the user's desired outcome. The ultimate goal is to judge when the user can safely be interrupted, with what kind of message, and via which device. Perhaps the same agent could serve as a travel assistant by searching the Internet and gathering all the relevant information about airline schedules and hotel prices, and, with the user's consent, returning with the electronic tickets and reservations. In time, smart agents representing both providers and consumers will be the service co-producers; they will employ decision informatics techniques to accomplish their tasks. Third, perhaps the best example of an integrated and adaptive complex service system is the evolving Web 2.0. It is user-built, user-centered and user-run. In other words, it is a social network for integration -including collaboration and communication -of activities (e.g., eBay, Amazon.com, Wikipedia, Twitter, MySpace, Friendster, LinkedIn, Plaxo, etc.), entertainment (e.g., Facebook, Ning, Bebo, Second Life, World of Warcraft, etc.), and searches (e.g., Google, Yahoo, MSN.com, etc.). Unfortunately, the integrated web, while being a somewhat successful e-commerce platform, is unable to interpret, manipulate or make sense of its content. On the other hand and with the encoding of web pages in a semantic web format, J Syst Sci Syst Eng the evolving web will be able to allow for the above mentioned smart or decision informatics (DI) agents to undertake semantic analysis of user intent and web content, to understand and filter their meaning, and to adaptively respond in light of user needs. The Semantic Web, then, will be an ideal complex service system where integration and adaptation will constitute the basis for its functionality. However, several obstacles must be overcome before reaching full functionality. For example, semantic standards or ontologies -such as the Web Ontology Language (OWL) -must be established so as to maintain compatible and interoperable formats; at present, health care and financial services companies are each developing their own ontology. Also, while AdWords and AdSense have helped to attract online advertising dollars to search sites, most social networking siteswhere millions of \"eye balls\" or users congregate and interact -do not have a viable business model. Indeed in November 2007, when Facebook tried to get between its users with its Beacon program (which tracked Facebook users' purchases and displayed them to their friends), protests of privacy violations",

            "text": "). As a consequence, researchers must expand their systems (i.e., holistic-oriented), man (i.e., adaptive-oriented) methods to include and be integrated with those techniques that are beyond science and engineering. For example, higher customer satisfaction can be achieved not only by improving service quality but also by lowering customer expectation. In essence, asstated by Hipel et al. (2007), systems, man and cybernetics is an integrative, adaptive and multidisciplinary approach to creative problem solving, which takes into account stakeholders' value systems and satisfies important societal, environmental, economic and other criteria in order to enhance the decision making process when designing, implementing, operating and maintaining a system or system of systems to meet societal needs in a fair, ethical and sustainable manner throughout the system's life cycle. Fifth and finally, although some companies (e.g., IBM) are focused on developing a science for services, it should be noted that serviceslike manufacturing, agriculture, construction, or mining -is an economic sector or application domain, not a basic discipline. Thus, services are not akin to a computer, which computational underpinning can be subjected to a scientific or disciplinary approach. On the other hand, like manufacturing and the other application domains, services can be subjected to a systems engineering approach -which, in turn, implies an integration and adaptation of a host of scientific disciplines (e.g., physics, mathematics, statistics, behavioral science, social science, etc.). Indeed, what is required is a services-related transdisciplinary -beyond a single disciplinary -ontology or taxonomy as a basis for disciplinary integration and adaptation.
