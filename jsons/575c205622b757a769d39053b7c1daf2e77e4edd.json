The prevalence of this newly identified agent ranges between 1.5% 5 and 10.3%. 8 A recent study by the Australian group from the Queensland Paediatric Infectious Diseases Laboratory demonstrated that hBoV is one of the most frequent pathogens responsible for respiratory tract infections in hospitalized children, thus being directly behind picornaviruses, adenoviruses and human metapneumovirus. 10 Clinical symptoms most frequently associated with human bocavirus infection include cough, rhinorrhea, and fever, but also diarrhoea and paroxysmal cough may be symptoms of interest. 7 However, the risk of severe clinical complications following bocavirus infection in infants remains to be elucidated. We have recently described a case report of a 28-year-old female (adult) patient with a non-Hodgkin lymphoma who suffered from an atypical pneumonia that was associated with hBoV. 6 Based on this clinical experience and in continuation of our study of new viral respiratory infections in pediatric patients we also started to investigate respiratory specimens from a series of severe lower respiratory tract infections treated in primary care pediatric hospitals in our region. In nasopharyngeal aspirates of one patient suffering from an acute bronchiolitis and negative results for other respiratory viruses hBoV was detected by PCR.",

A capillary blood gas analysis revealed a global respiratory insufficiency with a pH of 7.11 and a severe hypercapnia (pCO 2 84 mmHg). The boy was treated with oxygen, salbutamol and ipratropium bromide by inhalation, systemic steroids, chloral hydrate, and theophylline.

In infants the newly detected human metapneumovirus (hMPV) and also hBoV seem to be important pathogens in acute lower respiratory tract infection. HBoV DNA has been detected in 3.1e10.3% of children less than 3 years of age 1e3, 5, 7, 8 and has also been observed as a respiratory pathogen in adult high-risk patients. 4, 6 Taking into account the clinical observations by Foulongne and co-workers 11 who described bronchiolitis as the major diagnosis in hBoV infected patients with the major symptoms of dyspnea, respiratory distress, and cough, the clinical picture described here seems to be typical for an hBoV infection. Most frequent symptoms observed in the largest study on hBoV epidemiology and clinical symptoms were cough, throat, rhinorrhea, and fever, thus presenting as the common cold. 5, 7 Arnold and co-workers 7 found that most patients (63%) were below 12 months of age, thus it cannot be excluded that the patient described here (2 years of age) suffered from a reinfection. In contrast to the recent study by Weissbrich et al., 8 who observed a high rate of coinfections (39%), no accompanying and hitherto known pathogen was detected in the recent case. Thus, although it remained still impossible to fulfil Koch's postulates, and although a coinfection with another respiratory pathogen cannot be fully excluded, it seems probable that the current episode was indeed induced by hBoV.",
