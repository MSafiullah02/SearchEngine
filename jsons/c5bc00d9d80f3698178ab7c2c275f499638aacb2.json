It is a potentially fatal disease to many vulnerable patients including the elderly and those with chronic illnesses; but because this virus is a novel one, there are no firmly established treatment protocols. Many treatment methods are being investigated worldwide, and scientific conclusions drawn from these endeavors are crucial for healthcare professionals in combating this disease. In this network meta-analysis, we focus specifically on the pharmacologic agents that have been investigated for the treatment of COVID-19 and aim to produce a comprehensive picture of the evidence from current data in order to produce relevant insights on the comparative efficacy and safety profiles of various pharmacologic agents against COVID-19.",

It has caused a global pandemic affecting almost everyone in the world and causing millions of confirmed cases and hundreds of thousands of deaths (1) . While many infected patients experience self-limiting course of the disease, manyespecially the elderly and those with underlying illnessesrequire hospitalization and intensive care as the virus causes decompensation of the body's systems causing potentially lethal complications such as acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Therefore, treatments to reduce death and decompensation while expediting viral clearance and clinical recovery are crucial. However, as of May 16 th , 2020 while many pharmaceutical agents have been and are being investigated worldwide for efficacy and safety in COVID-19 patients, none have been shown to have clear superiority over others. Therefore, in this network meta-analysis (NMA), we aim to compare the multiple treatment options that are currently being investigated for COVID-19 with the goal of synthesizing the scattered research results on the pharmacological treatment of COVID-19, determining which agents have demonstrated efficacy, and finally comparing agents against each other to determine which ones are most effective and safe for hospitalized COVID-19 patients based on data accrued so far.",
