            "text": "Kawasaki disease, or mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome, was first described in Japan in the late 1960s as an illness characterized by persistent fever, conjunctivitis, mucous membrane changes, acral erythema with desquamation, and cervical adenopathy, associated with coronary arteritis (1, 2) . While earlier descriptions of the disease were limited to Asia and Hawaii, the disease is now known to occur worldwide. The disease is primarily one of young children, with 85% of cases occurring in children under five years. It is uncommon in children less than 6 months. There have been some epidemiologic investigations linking Kawasaki disease to freshly cleaned carpets, humidifier use, and living near a body of water, but these associations have not been observed consistently (3) .",

There are only rare cases of the disease occurring in infants less than three months, suggesting protection via passive maternal antibodies. These fi ndings have suggested an infectious agent, yet extensive investigations have failed to detect one. There is a recently described association between Kawasaki disease and a novel coronavirus in a small series, but further study will be required to evaluate the strength of this association (4) . IgA plasma cells have been found in early and subacute lesions of Kawasaki vasculitis, suggesting the possibility of an immune response to a gastrointestinal or respiratory tract pathogen (5) . Furthermore, the IgA response is oligoclonal rather than polyclonal, favoring an antigen-driven response over nonspecific B-cell activation (6) . The incidence of Kawasaki disease is greater in the Asian population and in siblings and parents of those with the disease, suggesting a genetic predisposition (3) .",

Cervical adenopathy Strict use of these criteria will miss cases of Kawasaki disease, so-called \"atypical\" or \"incomplete\" Kawasaki disease. These are patients in whom coronary arteritis is present, in association with persistent fever, and fewer than four other diagnostic criteria. Vigilance for these cases is mandated because of the potential for disastrous consequences in untreated coronary arteritis. In cases of suspected Kawasaki disease, imaging of the coronary vessels is indicated. In young children, transthoracic echocardiography can be used to diagnose coronary artery changes with high specificity, but in older children and in adults, visualization of the vessels is more difficult. Coronary X-ray angiography has been the mainstay of evaluation. However, recently, magnetic resonance angiography has been shown to be comparable to X-ray angiography, and is likely to become the future standard for evaluation of coronary abnormalities in older children and in adults (9) . Laboratory fi ndings may include elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and C-reactive protein, leukocytosis with left shift, pyuria, proteinuria, or anemia. In cases of suspected Kawasaki disease, a suggested diagnostic evaluation is given.",

A summary of important features of each is given in The typical pathologic finding in Kawasaki disease is that of a vasculitis, occurring most commonly in the coronary arteries, but also occurring in renal, iliac, femoral, and mesenteric arteries. There are initially subendothelial cell collections of macrophages, lymphocytes, and neutrophils (11) . Plasma cells and eosinophils are also constituents of the infiltrate (5, 12) . The inflammation eventually becomes transmural, and can extend along the adventitia as in polyarteritis nodosa. In Kawasaki disease, in contrast to polyarteritis nodosa, there are fewer neutrophils, and fibrinoid necrosis is not prominent (11) . Biopsy specimens of skin in Kawasaki disease do not have specific findings, but in those with sterile pustules, the location is subcorneal (8) .",

A comparison of treatment with aspirin alone versus aspirin with gammaglobulin reveals a striking reduction in the development of coronary aneurysms in the gammaglobulin group, and greater resolution of existing coronary lesions over time in the same group (13) . Treatment with gammaglobulin is generally given using 2 mg/kg as a single infusion (3). High-dose aspirin is recommended early on in the disease to prevent thrombotic events, 80-100 mg/kg per day, divided in four doses, for up to 14 days, and then 3-5 mg/ kg as a single daily dose for seven weeks or longer (14) . Some authors advocate lower doses of aspirin (15) . Aspirin does not reduce aneurysm formation (16) . A recent retrospective study has called into question the benefit of aspirin therapy, but for the present, it remains part of the standard treatment (17) . Eighty-nine percent of patients respond to a single dose of gammaglobulin, but the remainder will remain febrile. A second dose of gammaglobulin has been advocated in those remaining febrile for the 48 to 72 hours following the first dose. Of these, twothirds will become afebrile with the second dose (18) . Patients with persistent fever after one dose of gammaglobulin, who receive additional gammaglobulin, have a decrease in cardiac complications (19) . Treatment options for those refractory to two doses of intravenous gammaglobulin include additional doses of gammaglobulin, pulse methylprednisolone, infliximab, cyclosporine, cyclophosphamide, and plasmapheresis (3, 20) . A small trial of pulse methylprednisolone in addition to gammaglobulin and aspirin revealed more rapid resolution of symptoms in the group treated with steroids compared to the standard treatment group (gammaglobulin and aspirin), but no differences in cardiac outcome between the two groups (21) .",
