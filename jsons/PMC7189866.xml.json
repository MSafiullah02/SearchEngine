            "text": "Vaccination, an important medical procedure initiated in infancy, provides immunological protection from a variety of infectious diseases that are encountered in the environment. This procedure defends the individual against a myriad of pathogens without the necessity of experiencing the infectious disease sequela. Many vaccines are composed of highly purified antigens and require the addition of an adjuvant to provide an adequate immune response. Aluminum-based adjuvants (ABA) have been used since 1932 and are presently used in more than 30 licensed vaccines (Di Pasquale et al., 2015). The types of adjuvants that are available for use in human vaccines include aluminum hydroxide gel (Alhydrogel) and an aluminum phosphate gel (Adju-Phos). Another adjuvant, Imject Alum, is available for research and manufacturing but not clinical use (Instructions Imject Alum). Alum is a water soluble aluminum salt composed of aluminum potassium sulfate. It is a reagent that forms the basis of preparation of aluminum-containing adjuvants (Hem et al., 2007). In this study, we evaluated all four of these aluminum containing salts to determine how the cellular response is affected by dose and composition of ABAs or alum.",

            "text": "Aluminum adjuvants are present in vaccines against hepatitis A, hepatitis B, diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis (DTaP), Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib), human papillomavirus (HPV) and pneumococcus infectious agents (Center for Disease Control, CDC-2019). Based on the manufacturer, the type and aluminum content of vaccines licensed for use in the United States, varies. For instance, the Dtap vaccine manufactured by GSK (tradename Kinrix) contains \u22640.6 mg of aluminum present as aluminum hydroxide while Dtap vaccine manufactured by Sanofi-Pasteur (tradename Daptacel) contains 0.33 mg of aluminum present as aluminum phosphate (HogenEsch et al., 2018). It is thought that the amount of aluminum found in these vaccines poses a low risk of harm compared to its benefits (Mitkus et al., 2011). In the present study, we used 10-100 \u00b5g/mL concentrations which are in the range used by other investigators to assess the in vitro response to ABAs (Ulanova et al., 2001; Mold et al., et al., 2016; Vrieling et al., 2020). The mechanism by which ABAs strengthen vaccine efficiency is likely to encompass multiple pathways (Shi et al., 2019) that lead to a mainly type-2 (humoral) mediated immunity (Kuroda et al., 2013).",

            "text": "A mechanism by which ABAs appear to enhance the efficacy of vaccines is by inducing cytotoxicity and the subsequent release of damage associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) that activate cellular immune response to the coexisting antigen in the vaccine (Kono and Rock, 2008; Marichal et al., 2011). Previous research demonstrated differences in the physiochemical properties of Alhydrogel, Imject Alum, and Adju-Phos in regards to their solubility, uptake, and viability using human monocytic (THP-1) cells (Mold et al., 2016). In the present study we further evaluated the response of THP-1 cells that were differentiated into macrophages, as well as human astrocytes, exposed to ABAs or alum. We hypothesized that irrespective of adjuvant composition, or tissue derivation of cells, ABAs dose-dependently would cause the same degree of necrosis that then leads to proinflammatory cytokine release. Tissue resident macrophages would be encountered almost immediately after administration of ABA-containing vaccines. Astrocytes on the other hand would be protected by the blood brain barrier. However, it has been proposed that aluminum in vaccines may persist in cells of the immune system (such as macrophages) and that these cells can travel to distal sites such as the brain and indirectly impact these tissues (Gherardi et al., 2019). Astrocytes are immune-competent resident brain cells that play an important role in homeostatic regulation of the brain. We had previously shown that prolonged exposure to low levels of aluminum, present in the drinking water, enhances oxidative and inflammatory markers specifically in mouse brains (Campbell et al., 2004; Becaria et al., 2006). Furthermore, the proinflammatory effect of aluminum was confined to cells of glial origin (Campbell et al., 1999; Campbell et al., 2002). In the present study, we aimed to also investigate the potential of aggregated forms of aluminum, such as that present in ABAs, to cause an oxidative or inflammatory response in brain-derived (astrocytes) in comparison to peripherally-derived (macrophages) immune-competent cells.",

Studies have shown that there are various mechanisms by which ABAs contribute to immunogenicity of vaccines. One of the best studied of these is the role aluminum salts play in adsorption of the inoculated antigen. ABAs have the capability of turning the soluble antigens into colloids which can then more effectively be internalized, decrease peptide degradation, and enhance MHCII expression by antigen-presenting cells (Ghimire et al., 2012).",

Aluminum phosphate gel (Adju-Phos) is non-crystalline due to disruption of the crystallization process by phosphate (HogenEsch et al., 2018). Because the composition of the media may have influenced the size of the aluminum particles, we evaluated the effective diameter of the aluminum adjuvants in both astrocyte and macrophage media for 24 h & 72 h. Incubation of alhydrogel in both astrocyte and macrophage medium for 24 h resulted in formation of particles in the 1048 - 1198 nm range at both concentrations tested. Adju-phos particles were larger (2114 \u2013 3810 nm) and this was concentration-dependent mainly in the macrophage medium. Imject particles were approximately 1288 - 1394 nm in diameter while alum particles were the smallest (range of 422 \u2013 844 nm) particularly in the macrophage medium assessed.

This is in agreement with a study showing that in THP-1 cells, Adju-Phos displayed much greater cytotoxicity compared to Alhydrogel (Mold et al., 2016). Neither alum nor Imject (neither of which are used clinically) caused decrease in cell viability in the macrophages. The degree to which this finding might influence the effectiveness of Imject as an adjuvant should be further investigated. Both Alhydrogel and Adju-Phos caused a pronounced loss of cell viability in macrophages derived from THP-1 cells after a 72 h exposure. No clear relationship between particle size and toxicity was observed at this later time point, and thus additional physicochemical properties may contribute to loss of cell viability. Cell viability in astrocytes was also decreased to the same extent after exposure to either Alhydrogel or Adju-Phos after 24 h. Comparing exposure to the two clinically relevant ABAs, the loss of viability in astrocytes after 72 h was more pronounced after exposure to Adju-Phos, especially at the lower concentrations. Overall, susceptibility of astrocytes did not appear to be dose-dependent as the lower concentrations of Adju-Phos (10 & 20 \u00b5g/mL) were just as capable of reducing viability as the larger doses (50 & 100 \u00b5g/mL). After the 72 h exposure, both Alhydrogel and Adju-phos caused enhancement of ROS formation (especially at the higher doses tested) in both THP-1 derived macrophages and astrocytes. However, an enhancement of general ROS formation was not observed at the 24 h time point in the astrocytes. Thus the loss of viability does not appear to be associated with oxidative stress, but the cell death appears to contribute to subsequent enhancement of oxidative events as judged by an increase in general ROS formation.",

The Nlrp3 inflammasome plays an important role in augmenting the inflammatory reaction (Baroja-Mazo et al., 2014) which is a mechanism by which ABAs modulate cellular behavior in an immune response. DNA released from ABA-exposed dying cells can also be perceived as a damage associated molecular pattern (DAMP) that can modify immunity initiated by aluminum containing vaccines (Marichal et al., 2011). A study on the kinetics of the inflammatory response induced by ABAs demonstrated that after vaccination, neutrophils are recruited to the area followed by macrophages (Lu and HogenEsch, 2013).

Macrophages exposed to all three of the aluminum adjuvants show a dose-dependent increase in TNF-\u03b1. On the other hand, astrocytes exposed to the ABAs released significant amounts of IL-6 in a nonmonotonic dose response pattern. We have previously reported that exposure to aluminum sulfate (500\u00b5M) for 48 h resulted in upregulation of oxidative events in glioma but not neuroblastoma cells (Campbell et al., 1999), indicating that depending on the type of brain-derived cell evaluated, aluminum may cause a specific response. After a 6d exposure to the same concentration of aluminum sulfate, we observed that a human glioblastoma cell line released TNF-\u03b1 but not IL-6 in response to the Al salt (Campbell et al., 2002). Thus the glioblastoma cell line appears to have a cytokine response resembling that of macrophages rather than that of primary human astrocytes. Cytokine release in response to aluminum salts may underlie the immunomodulatory role of aluminum adjuvants and may be closely related to the characteristics and function of the type of cell evaluated. To what degree these differences in cytokine profile may dictate the safety and efficacy of ABAs needs to be further investigated.",

In this study, the lowest concentration of aluminum caused the largest effect. The biphasic effect on IL-6 release that we observed in human astrocytes exposed to ABAs is concordant with this observation and may in part explain the reason why low concentrations of aluminum salts may exert a more selectively neurological response. Macrophagic myofasciitis (MMF) is a rare muscle disease that has been linked to ABA containing vaccines (Gherardi and Authier, 2012). This rare condition has also been associated with cognitive abnormalities (Aoun Sebaiti et al., 2018). Elevations of specific cytokines have been suggested as markers for MMF (Cadusseau et al., 2014). Therefore, while the use of ABAs may provide a very important and useful tool in eliciting immunogenicity in vaccines, there may be a select group of individuals who may be predisposed to adverse consequences of aluminum-containing vaccines. For example, individuals with autoimmune diseases may over-react to the immunogenicity of ABAs. The increase in immune activity would in turn worsen these conditions.",

In severe COVID-19 cases, there is a cytokine storm that leads to lung damage and eventual death (Shi et al., 2020). A similar genetic predisposition to mount an inappropriately strong immune response to aluminum particles may predispose a subpopulation of individuals to potential adverse health outcomes. While differing cell types may be equally vulnerable to Al salts, the consequences of astrocyte injury may be worse than macrophage damage. This may be reflected by reports that the brain is distinctively vulnerable to low concentrations of aluminum salts. Therefore, in individuals with underlying neurological conditions, the risk/benefits of ABA containing vaccines should be evaluated before administration.",
