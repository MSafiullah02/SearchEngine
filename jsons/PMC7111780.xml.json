The recent emergence of a novel human CoV responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (Drosten et al., 2003, Ksiazek et al., 2003, Kuiken et al., 2003, Peiris et al., 2003) highlights the public health risks associated with the continual evolution and zoonotic spread of new CoVs. The human SARS-CoV of 2002\u20132003 was likely derived from a CoV of the civet cat, an animal common to live-animal food markets in China (Guan et al., 2003). Cross-species transmission events have also been implicated in the emergence and establishment of other novel CoVs, such as the transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) of pigs (Sanchez et al., 1992) and the human respiratory CoV OC43 (Vijgen et al., 2005).",

This glycoprotein mediates the initial attachment of the virus to host-cell receptors and the subsequent fusion of the viral and cellular membranes to allow entry of the virion core. The S glycoproteins within the CoV family differ among themselves in several features that are reflective of their serologic and phylogenetic groupings (Gonzalez et al., 2003, Lai and Holmes, 2001). Of particular interest is the dimorphism seen with respect to proteolytic maturation of the S glycoprotein precursor. In the group 2 viruses, such as the prototype murine hepatitis virus (MHV), and in the avian group 3 viruses, the S glycoprotein precursor is cleaved, likely by furin-like cellular proteases (de Haan et al., 2004), to yield the canonical receptor-binding (S1) and transmembrane fusion (S2) subunits. By contrast, the S glycoproteins of the group 1 viruses are not subjected to proteolytic cleavage during biogenesis. Interestingly, the newly emerged SARS-CoV displays characteristics of both groups: although the SARS-CoV is phylogenetically related to the group 2 viruses (Gibbs et al., 2004, Snijder et al., 2003), the S glycoprotein does not show evidence of proteolytic maturation (Moore et al., 2004, Simmons et al., 2004, Song et al., 2004, Xiao et al., 2003).",

Cleavage by cellular proteases is universally required to enable the fusion potential of the envelope glycoproteins of retroviruses, orthomyxoviruses, paramyxoviruses, filoviruses and arenaviruses. Upon subsequent activation of the matured Class I envelope glycoprotein, by receptor binding and/or low endosomal pH, these complexes undergo profound structural reorganization to ultimately form highly stable trimer-of-hairpins structures that contribute to fusion of the viral and cellular membranes ((Eckert and Kim, 2001, Hughson, 1997, Skehel and Wiley, 2000, Weissenhorn et al., 1999) and references therein). Although the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein is a bona fide member of the Class I fusion proteins (Bosch et al., 2003, Duquerroy et al., 2005, Follis et al., 2005, Supekar et al., 2004, Xu et al., 2004), it paradoxically appears able to initiate membrane fusion without proteolytic activation and to complete the conformational changes without proteolytic separation of the S1 and S2 subunits.",

We show that the introduction of a prototypic furin recognition motif at R667 allows for efficient cleavage of the mutant glycoprotein and increased cell\u2013cell fusion activity. Nonetheless, the cleaved S glycoprotein was not able to enhance the infectivity of pseudotyped virions. These findings reinforce, in the converse, the observations reported in the naturally cleaved group 2 CoVs (Bos et al., 1997, de Haan et al., 2004, Hingley et al., 2002) and call attention to the distinct, albeit unclear, requirements for virion entry in the CoVs.",

Alignment within the S1 receptor-binding domain was minimal, and meaningful similarity was observed only in the S2 fusion domain. These similarities include the N- and C-terminal heptad-repeat regions that together comprise the \u03b1-helical core of the fusion-active trimer-of-hairpins structure and the intervening \u2018loop\u2019 region. Extending towards the N-terminus, the alignment could readily be followed through to a well-conserved nonamer (IPTNFSISI) at SARS-CoV positions 696\u2013704 (Fig. 1A). In the group 2 viruses that are proteolytically cleaved (e.g., MHV and BCoV), the furin protease recognition site lies 33 amino acids upstream of this nonamer (RRAHR and RRSRR, respectively). The HuCoV OC43 contains a variant site (RRSRG) at which cleavage may also occur (Kunkel and Herrler, 1996). Further upstream of the furin-like recognition site in the group 2 glycoproteins, we identified a GxCx motif that could also be made to align with the group 1 and SARS-CoV glycoproteins (Fig. 1A). We speculate that the conserved GxCx and nonamer motifs delineate the junction between the S1 and S2 domains in the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein.",

By contrast, one or more basic residues remain in the glycoproteins of SARS-CoV and the human CoVs 229E and NL63. The alignment for these human viruses in Fig. 1B highlights the single arginine at position 667 of the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein, which may signal a protease-sensitive site.

To test this hypothesis, we mutated the two basic amino acids in the presumptive S1\u2013S2 junction region to serine. As shown in Fig. 2A (top), the wild-type, R667S and K672S glycoproteins were comparably expressed to yield the intact S glycoprotein, which migrated as two precursor bands: the mature, terminally glycosylated form of 220 kDa molecular weight (S\nr) and an Endo H-sensitive (S\ns) form of 200 kDa ((Song et al., 2004) and K.E.F. and J.H.N, unpublished). These collapse upon deglycosylation with PNGase F to yield the 140 kDa S polypeptide (Fig. 2A, bottom). The R667S and K672S mutations did not appear to alter the expression or glycosylation of the glycoproteins, and we too find no evidence of proteolytic cleavage to form S1 and S2 subunits. Interestingly, however, the ability of the R667S mutant to promote cell\u2013cell fusion was consistently reduced to 60% of wild-type levels (Fig. 2B). Fusion by the K672S mutant was largely unaffected. These results point to R667 as an important amino acid in the S glycoprotein and perhaps as a site susceptible to proteolytic cleavage.",

            "text": "To investigate whether proteolytic cleavage at the basic amino acid residues, were it to occur, might facilitate cell\u2013cell fusion activity, we mutated the wild-type SARS-CoV glycoprotein to construct a prototypic furin recognition site (RRSRR) at either position. Based on our alignment, we engineered three variants (Fig. 1B): one at position R667 to replace the resident sequence with YHTRRSRR (referred to as HTR) and another at the same position designed to accommodate the deletion indicated in the alignment, YHTVRRSRR (HTVR). The sequence at K672 (RSTSQK) was shortened to RRSRR in order to include the two naturally occurring basic residues (the SLLR variant). These furin-site-containing glycoproteins were expressed in COS-7 cells and isolated using the C-terminal affinity tag (Fig. 3). Proteolytic cleavage to yield novel subunits of 110 kDa and 90 kDa was apparent in the HTVR glycoprotein and less so in HTR (top left). Little cleavage was seen in the SLLR glycoprotein. The proteolytically cleaved products appear to be derived from the mature, terminally glycosylated S\nr form of the S glycoprotein as the 220 kDa form in HTVR was consistently reduced relative to the S\ns form. This result is in keeping with the subcellular localization of the furin protease in the trans-Golgi network (Molloy et al., 1999, Rockwell et al., 2002). Upon deglycosylation with PNGase F, the two novel subunits in HTVR and HTR migrated as 72 and 64 kDa peptides (bottom, left), consistent with the anticipated molecular weights of the predicted S1 and S2 polypeptides, respectively. The S2 polypeptide was typically accompanied by lower molecular forms, which suggest additional N-terminal cleavage events. As in the naturally cleaved S glycoprotein of MHV (Krueger et al., 2001), the S1 and S2 subunits derived from the furin-site-containing glycoproteins remain associated upon cell lysis in nonionic detergent.",

This enabled us to determine whether the S1 subunit was shed from the proteolytically cleaved complex, as has been reported for the naturally cleaved MHV S glycoprotein (Krueger et al., 2001). Upon immunoprecipitation from the medium (Fig. 3\n; right), the S1 subunit was readily isolated in cultures expressing HTVR and HTR. A small amount of S1 was also shed from the SLLR mutant. No S1 subunit was found in the culture medium from cells expressing the wild-type SARS-CoV S glycoprotein, consistent with the lack of proteolytic cleavage. Taken together, these studies indicate that proteolytic cleavage of the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein can be achieved by the introduction of a furin recognition motif, especially at R667.

In multiple experiments, this mutant generated 3- to 8-fold more syncytia than did the wild-type S glycoprotein. The HTR glycoprotein was also more fusogenic than the wild-type (1.8 fold), whereas the insertion in SLLR appeared to inhibit fusion. Discounting potential detrimental effects of the amino acid substitutions per se, the fusogenicity of the mutant glycoproteins generally correlated with the extent of proteolytic cleavage (Fig. 3). Recombinant expression of ACE2 receptor was required in all cases for fusion. The marked increase in fusogenicity in concert with proteolytic cleavage suggests strongly that proteolytic maturation of the CoV S glycoprotein impacts the ability of the glycoprotein to mediate membrane fusion.",

A Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell line deficient in furin protease (FD11; (Gordon et al., 1995)) was obtained from S. Leppla (NIH) and used to express the S glycoproteins. The FD11 cell line was derived following chemical mutagenesis and selection for resistance to anthrax toxin protective antigen (PA), which is activated intracellularly by furin cleavage (Gordon et al., 1995). As shown in Fig. 6\n, proteolytic processing of the HTVR, HTR and SLLR glycoproteins was abrogated in the furin-deficient FD11 cell line. The S1 and S2 subunits were absent in FD11 cells, and S1 was not detected in the cell culture medium. These findings provide evidence that proteolytic cleavage in the furin-site-containing mutants is indeed mediated by the furin protease.",

Co-expression of furin cDNA in the CHO cells resulted in a 5-fold increase in fusion activity by the wild-type and the K672S glycoproteins (Fig. 8B). The increase was considerably blunted in the R667S mutant, consistent with the reduction in furin-mediated cleavage at the mutated SLLS667 site. Thus, maximal cell\u2013cell fusion activity correlates with the presence of the S1 subunit generated by cleavage at R667.

To determine whether proteolytic cleavage of the normally uncleaved SARS-CoV S glycoprotein affects virion infectivity, we generated pseudotyped retroviral virions bearing the wild-type and HTVR SARS-CoV glycoproteins (Moore et al., 2004, Simmons et al., 2004, Yang et al., 2004, Yuan et al., 2004). For these studies, we utilized the HIV-1 provirus-based vector pNL4-3.Luc.R\u2212E\u2212, which has been engineered to disrupt HIV envelope glycoprotein expression and to encode a luciferase reporter protein (Connor et al., 1995). A codon-optimized S glycoprotein gene (Moore et al., 2004) was provided by M. Farzan (Harvard Medical School, Boston) to obviate the need for vTF7-3 in these studies. The codon-optimized gene was further modified to delete the C-terminal 19 amino acids (co-S \u039419) that interfere with pseudotyping efficiency (Fukushi et al., 2005, Giroglou et al., 2004, Moore et al., 2004). Purified pseudotyped virions bearing the wild-type co-S \u039419 glycoprotein or the HTVR-derivative were initially examined by immunoprecipitation to characterize pseudotype formation (Fig. 9A). Comparable levels of HIV Gag proteins p24 and p17 were found in pseudotyped particles bearing either co-S \u039419 or co-HTVR \u039419 glycoproteins. Importantly, comparable amounts of the two S glycoproteins were incorporated into the retroviral particles. Pseudotyped virions containing the HTVR glycoprotein were highly enriched in the cleaved subunits (S1 and S2) relative to the expressing cells (e.g., Fig. 3), although the uncleaved form was also present. This enrichment is likely due to the exclusion of immature intracellular forms of the glycoprotein from the pseudotyped virion sample. As anticipated, no cleaved S glycoprotein products were observed in virions bearing the wild-type co-S \u039419 glycoprotein. Thus, the respective S glycoproteins are comparably and faithfully incorporated into pseudotyped virions.",

Thus, the enhanced facility of the furin-cleaved HTVR glycoprotein to mediate membrane fusion is apparently not reflected in the overall process of virion entry. The disconnect between the membrane fusion activity of the S glycoprotein and its ability to mediate viral entry, demonstrated here in the normally uncleaved SARS-CoV S glycoprotein and previously in the normally cleaved glycoprotein of MHV (Bos et al., 1997, de Haan et al., 2004, Hingley et al., 2002), highlights unresolved complexities in the pathway used by CoVs to infect target cells.",

            "text": "The paradigm developed from the study of other Class I viral fusion proteins \u2013 that proteolytic maturation of a precursor glycoprotein is absolutely required to activate the fusogenic potential of the envelope glycoprotein complex \u2013 is not neatly applied to the CoV S glycoprotein. Some naturally occurring CoV S glycoproteins undergo proteolytic cleavage (those of the group 2 and 3 CoVs) and others do not (those of the group 1 viruses). Judging that it is unlikely that a proteolytically intact S glycoprotein is capable of mediating membrane fusion, one is left to consider the alternative that the fusion activity of the group 1 viruses, and the newly emerged SARS-CoV, may derive from proteolytic cleavage that has heretofore gone undetected. In this report, we have examined the role of furin cleavage on the fusogenicity of the normally uncleaved SARS-CoV S glycoprotein. We found that introduction of a synthetic furin recognition sequence at R667 in the putative S1\u2013S2 junctional region enabled efficient cleavage of the S glycoprotein to generate discrete S1 and S2 subunits and markedly increased the ability of the spike complex to mediate cell\u2013cell fusion. In the wild-type S glycoprotein, over-expression of furin cDNA made manifest a cleavage event that has not been otherwise observed (see also Bergeron et al., 2005), most likely at the naturally occurring sequence SLLR667. This exuberant cleavage likewise resulted in an increase in fusogenicity. Direct physical confirmation of cleavage at R667 is however lacking. Although a synthetic peptide bearing the SLLR site was insensitive to furin cleavage in vitro (Bergeron et al., 2005), it is possible that this sequence may be recognized under some natural conditions. For instance, cleavage might take place on the extracellular virion, perhaps in specialized tissue environments (Klenk and Garten, 1994) or upon endocytosis (Nash and Buchmeier, 1997, Simmons et al., 2004, Yang et al., 2004).",

In this regard, it is worthwhile to note another trait of the CoV S glycoproteins that is phylogenetically linked to the presence or absence of the furin cleavage site. In the ectodomain of S glycoproteins that remain uncleaved (group 1 CoVs), the N- and C-terminal heptad-repeat regions are extended by two additional in-register units (14 amino acids) relative to those of S glycoproteins that normally undergo furin cleavage (groups 2 and 3 CoVs). These heptad-repeat regions in Class I viral fusion proteins form the six \u03b1-helical core of the trimer-of-hairpins structure upon envelope glycoprotein activation and, in doing so, contribute energetically toward the initiation of membrane fusion ((Eckert and Kim, 2001, Hughson, 1997, Skehel and Wiley, 2000, Weissenhorn et al., 1999) and references therein). By this model, the extended heptad repeats in the group 1 viruses may facilitate formation of the six-helix bundle and membrane fusion, perhaps in compensation for the lack of furin cleavage. Biophysical and structural evidence for this suggestion is however lacking.",

Fuerst and B. Moss (National Institutes of Health) through the NIH AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program. COS-7 cells were infected with the recombinant vaccinia virus at a multiplicity of eight in Dulbecco's Minimal Essential Medium (DMEM) containing 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS). Cytosine arabinoside (araC) was added to the medium at 10 \u03bcM to limit vaccinia virus expression (Hruby et al., 1980). CHO cells were infected at a multiplicity of eight in F12 medium containing 2% FBS. After 30 min, infected cells were washed and transfected with the S glycoprotein expression plasmid using FuGene-6 reagent (Roche Biochemicals). Metabolic labeling using 80 \u03bcCi/ml of [35S]-ProMix (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) was initiated 6 h post-transfection in methionine- and cysteine-free DMEM containing 10% dialyzed FBS and 10 \u03bcM araC and was continued for 12\u201316 h.

A plasmid expressing the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) G glycoprotein was provided by J. Rose (Yale University) and served as a control in our studies.",
