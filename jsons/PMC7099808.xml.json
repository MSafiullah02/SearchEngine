To reap the benefits of ART and achieve widespread viral suppression, however, both access to and consistent adherence to medication is critical for achieving durable viral suppression and preventing drug resistance [3, 7\u201310].",

One population-based study covering 32 rural Kenyan and Ugandan communities noted that 45% of HIV-positive individuals had evidence of viral suppression prior to intensive interventions to improve ART initiation [16]. The recent Universal Test and Treat trial in Kwa Zulu Natal similarly noted high viral suppression rates for those on ART (85%), but an overall suppression rate of 49% among all PLHIV in 2016 [17], lower than the 2016\u20132017 PopART trial estimates of 63\u201372% virally suppressed in community cohorts [18].",

Studies in sub-Saharan Africa have found drug resistance mutations in 6\u201314% of ART-na\u00efve patients [11, 19, 20], and 84\u201389% of those with virological failure who initiated ART \u226512 months prior [19, 21]. Results from a systematic review and meta-analysis estimated a prevalence of pretreatment non-nucleotide reverse-transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) resistance of 11% in southern Africa [22]. Results from one of few population-based studies in South Africa indicate that transmitted resistance is increasing; from 0% in 2010, to 5 and 7% in 2011 and 2012, respectively [23]. Understanding factors driving virological failure, including the contribution of both pre-treatment drug resistance and acquired resistance, is critical to ensuring treatment remains effective and that existing first-line regimens can be preserved. Data are scarce on the prevalence of genotypic resistance in rural areas of Sub-Saharan Africa [15] and rarely is genotypic resistance data available from population-based sampling, coincident with both reported adherence and known ART exposure.",

We noted that while > 90% of men and women in care reported taking ART, only an estimated 29% of men and 60% of women in care achieved virologic suppression (< 5000 copies/mL) measured from dried blood spots (DBS). To understand the discrepancy between reported ART intake and viral suppression and assess contributing factors to the low suppression rates, we assessed all HIV-positive participants for antiretroviral drug exposure and performed drug resistance testing among those not suppressed. In this manuscript we examine the potential contribution of drug resistance mutations for low viral suppression in this HIV-positive, rural South African, population-based sample, discussing implications for future programming.",

Clinical cohort studies in sub-Saharan Africa have found a similar prevalence of drug resistance mutations in 6\u201311% of ART-na\u00efve patients [11, 20, 22]. If our study participants reported ART initiation accurately, 8% would represent the baseline estimate of transmitted resistance in the population, most of which was NNRTI only (63.0%), with fewer mutations representing PI/NRTI resistance (25.5%) and even fewer being single PI resistance (11.5%). For these patients, DRM could lead to first-line failure. Recent studies have demonstrated that the prevalence of transmitted and acquired drug resistance is increasing in RSA [20]. The cost in a program as large as South Africa\u2019s makes baseline DRM testing prior to ART initiation to inform regimen selection largely infeasible; however NHLS has instituted alert reports for adherence counseling and DRM testing should be made available when treatment failure is evident.",

Non-adherence is likely a big contributor to lack of viral suppression and acquired resistance in this sample. It is not possible to distinguish between acquired and transmitted resistance in our data, however, patterns of resistance by ART status provide insights about contributions of acquired and transmitted resistance in this population-based sample. The large majority of DRMs in this population occurred in the ART-initiated population, implying a high likelihood of acquired resistance playing a central role, particularly with all mutations demonstrating NRTI/NNRTI (first-line) dual resistance among the analyte positive group. In fact, research has noted that a high proportion of adults and children who received first line ART will develop virological failure during the first 5 years, with 70\u201390% of patients in virologic failure acquiring drug-resistant HIV [36]. While this estimate of DRM is higher than that observed in our sample, we were unable to sequence 30% of samples and the majority (22/31) of those were ART positive with viral load measures close to the cut-off (i.e. 20,000 copies or less) for virologic failure. If all ART positive participants with genotyping failure had resistance mutations, this would represent 75.6% of analyte positive participants, coinciding with current estimates [36]. Indeed, if participants were partially suppressed on ART and therefore had positive analytes and lower but not suppressed viral loads, they would be more prone to generate resistance and may lead to an underestimate of DRMs in this population.",

            "text": "The extremely high rates of dual NRTI/NNRTI resistance among the analyte positive group has important implications for the future of the current first-line treatment. Currently the South African national program recommends that providers consider switching patients on the first-line drug regimen if the patient has experienced virological failure (VL > 1000 copies/mL) on at least two occasions two months apart despite good adherence. Our data indicate that approximately one-third of those who report ART intake are negative for analytes, making a premature decision to switch regimens potentially costly and could encourage further DRM. With South Africa currently starting up introduction of a new triple combination regimen of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, lamivudine (3TC), and dolutegravir (TLD) [37, 38], some progress in stemming resistance to NNRTI could be imminent. However, even with availability of the new regimen, routine monitoring of resistance remains critical [39]. Finally, circulating drug-resistant viruses may have implications for persons initiating PrEP with TDF/FTC. The few seroconversions among individuals enrolled in PrEP trials occurred among those who started PrEP during unrecognized acute HIV infection, and the emergence of resistance primarily involved M184V/I, which can be selected for under the selective pressure of FTC [40\u201342].",

            "text": "A strength of this study is the population-based sample in an understudied area with data on viral load, ART analytes, and DRMs. Our data also has several limitations. Only 70% of the samples were sequenced, with failure being highest for those not suppressed on ART and with comparatively lower viral load measures, which could lead to an underestimation of DRMs if that population is intermittently adherent. Studies restricted to ART-na\u00efve populations using the same medium for genotyping have sequencing success of closer to 92% [43]. Additionally, ART initiation and adherence are based on self-report; however, the use of analyte data as a biological marker of initiation and adherence improves the study\u2019s accuracy. We cannot distinguish between acquired and transmitted resistance in our data, and, finally, we used DBS instead of plasma for the assays. Though DBS offer a feasible, low-resource alternative for viral load and DRM surveillance, they have well documented limitations \u2013 notably cellular HIV DNA contributes to copy number when using whole blood instead of blood plasma samples [29]. We therefore used a conservative threshold of 5000 copies/mL for defining viral suppression, and, as a result, run the risk of over-estimating viral suppression. Even so, viral suppression in this study aligns well with data from the NHLS at the time of the study, which suggested that viral suppression among PLHIV in care (defined as < 400 copies/mL plasma) ranged from 52 to 75% for North West Province, depending on the district [44], similar to our estimates among those on treatment.",

Increasing ART coverage can significantly lower the risk of new HIV infections in South Africa [45]; however, gains in treatment expansion will be lost if inconsistent adherence is not addressed and resistance continues to increase. There is growing evidence that pre-treatment drug resistance is increasing in sub-Saharan Africa [22, 23], making it essential that policies around treatment regimens are reviewed and updated frequently, and that surveillance be instituted in both HIV-positive, ART-na\u00efve populations and among those failing treatment, including monitoring of drug exposure for non-adherence and treatment failure despite adherence. Countries should consider instituting sentinel sites for baseline drug resistance testing in settings where feasible.",
