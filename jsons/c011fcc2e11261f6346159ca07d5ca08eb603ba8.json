A significant reduction in the basic reproduction number has been estimated with travel restriction and physical distancing. Various governing bodies across the world are taking different steps to reduce the spread of the virus, especially through increased physical distancing. It is suggested to completely close down factories, offices, educational institutions, and in general, avoid mass gathering of people. Whenever it is not possible to shut down completely, it is advised to operate them with minimum capacity. With the adaptation of the strategy of systematically testing, tracing, and isolating patients, China demonstrated that it is possible to slow down the infection. The spread of the virus was slowed down in Singapore, South Korea, and Hong Kong through similar strategies.",

There are strict restrictions on travel, especially international air travel. It has impacted various other sectors such as entertainment, sports, hospitality, tourism, transportation, manufacturing, and many more as they depend on the integrated supply chain on a global scale. It has a severe impact on the finance and related markets. Global aviation industries are expected to lose more than 100 billion US$ due to such travel restrictions (Doherty 2020) . The overall impact on the world economy is expected to be much more. Yu and Aviso (2020) proposed a framework to estimate the direct and indirect effects of COVID-19.",

On the other hand, these restrictions have brought in a significant drop in air pollution in many regions, especially the emissions of nitrogen dioxide and carbon dioxide (McMahon 2020). It is too early to predict anything on a larger time scale. Substantial economic loss on one hand of the scale and the improvement in air quality, on the other, may significantly impact the future course of action and overall sustainability of this world. We may adopt to it and proceed for a better future. Or, we may rebound very strongly with more pollution to gain the lost ground. It is difficult to predict now.",
