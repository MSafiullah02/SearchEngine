Iran, n subsequent epicenter of COVID-19, announced a total of 724 deaths due to COVID-19 as of March 16, 2020 [2] . Given the highly infectious nature of the virus and the lack of proven specific therapeutic drugs and licensed vaccines effective against COVID-19, early diagnosis of the disease is of paramount importance [3] . As confirmed COVID-19 cases are being diagnosed all over the world, radiologists are key to prompt clinical diagnosis and understanding of the common imaging manifestation of the disease as they may encounter suspected cases prior to other clinicians. The experience of affected countries shows that CT can play a pivotal role for pneumonia screening and diagnosis by producing fine specific details. The common chest CT imaging of confirmed COVID-19 cases is reported here to aid prompt clinical diagnosis.",
