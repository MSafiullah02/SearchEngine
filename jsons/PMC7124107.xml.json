Rapid progress in the synthesis and understanding of nanomaterials in just a few years has led them to enter the world market in a big way. Figure 12.1 shows an overview of various fields in which nanomaterials have entered or are about to enter. In this chapter we shall briefly discuss some of these applications. \n",

Carbon dioxide once emitted does not dissociate easily and its equilibration by biomass and ocean takes place after several years. It is realized now that this has resulted into global warming, causing the melting of polar caps or huge glaciers at the north and the south poles of the earth. Glaciers while melting also release methane adding to the pollution. Already the pH of oceans is changing and at some places has resulted into de-colouration of the corals. Temperature rise by 4\u20135\u00b0 would extinguish many species on the earth. This has already started disturbing the eco-balance and the whole world is quite concerned about it due to the obvious reasons. However, the modern life style also depends upon the increasing consumption of power. It is speculated that the 13 TW annual consumption of power by the earth population (earth population also is increasing) would increase the demand to 20 TW by the year 2050. From where is this energy going to come? One needs to find clean, safe sources of energy which are sustainable as well as cost effective.",

Solar energy spectrum extends from UV to infra red. One way to tap energy is to collect the thermal energy in concentrated manner to heat water, cooking purposes and so on. This is being done quite profitably in many places now. However, it is quite a marginal relief to the energy stress on the global scale. Another option is to use photovoltaic panels and store the energy in batteries and use it whenever required like usual switching of electricity. Advantage with photovoltaic panels is that they can work in remote places like in villages in isolation or in urban areas. The surplus energy can be transferred to the electric grid. Such installations have proved to be cost effective even with the crystalline silicon photovoltaic panels which are a bit expensive.",

In a single layer polymer solar cell this is rather difficult. Once generated by absorption of photons, excitons just drift (excitons are charge neutral) and should not recombine. However, if there is an interface of acceptor and donor semiconductor polymer at the interface, they can be separated. Therefore, two polymer layer solar cell as in Fig. 12.10b is better than a single layer polymer solar cell (Fig. 12.10a). In order to absorb sufficient light the polymer thickness needs to be typically \u223c100 nm which is much larger than the typical exciton diffusion length. Thus photogenerated e-h pairs recombine before reaching the interfaces and result into an inefficient solar cell. A better solution is then to blend the donor and acceptor polymers forming a large number of interfaces where the excitons may get formed and electron-hole get separated. The BHJs, therefore, have been widely investigated (Fig. 12.10c) with the hope of getting reliable, reproducible, inexpensive and efficient, flexible solar cells for the future.",

Although conceptually simple, cost of fuel cells as well as hydrogen storage/transport and supply are daunting problems. Efforts are, therefore, being made to replace some of the expensive components in the fuel cells like platinum electrodes (catalyst used to dissociate or oxidize hydrogen and reduce oxygen) as well as to improve the electrolytes or polymer membranes using nanomaterials. Nanomaterials due to their size reduction can act as better catalyst sites as well as decrease the cost of the electrodes due to the small amounts needed. Attempts to use platinum nanoparticles and nanowires show some success in this direction. There are also attempts to replace even the costly platinum itself using nickel particles, carbon nanotubes and graphene in the form of composites. These can even be doped with suitable atoms to alter their electronic structure to make them effective catalysts. It is interesting that suitably developed nanocatalyst materials can work equally well for H2 or methanol as a fuel, giving more flexible fuel option in the same cell. Moreover, attempts are made to use \u2018self cleaning\u2019 electrodes so that H2 can be replaced with low grade and cheaper hydrocarbon gases as a source of fuel. The problem faced while using inexpensive hydrocarbon gases to replace H2 is that after dissociation they deposit carbon on the electrodes making them inefficient in short time. With the use of \u2018self cleaning\u2019 nanoparticles the contaminated electrodes can be cleaned at operating temperature of the cells. This would lower down the cost of the cells. There are experimental demonstrations of such ideas at laboratory scale now. Graphene coated indium-tin oxide (ITO) nanoparticles are shown to split hydrogen and oxygen equally well. In the quest for reducing the cost of the fuel cells successful demonstrations are given by developing ultra thin (<100 nm) polymer electrolyte membranes. The electrolytes (Nafion) are also blended with sulphonic acid functionalized single wall carbon nanotubes. This improves the transport of protons from the anode to the cathode in the fuel cell.",

Use of solar energy to produce H2 and its use in fuel cells is the best way of getting energy particularly for transportation purposes. The major requirement is that the anode material should have a suitable band gap (semiconductor) to absorb visible radiation, should be robust, reusable, have a long life and should have large catalytic activity. Spherical nanoparticles, nanowires, nanotubes, nanoflakes and some other morphologies are being investigated as they can offer large surface area and catalytically favourable sites. In order to increase the efficiency of hydrogen production the catalytic anodes are modified by using TiO2 nanoparticles doped with carbon as an anode and platinum as cathode for oxygen generation. Doping of TiO2 is essential to utilize visible and the IR part of the solar spectrum, as the bulk band gap of TiO2 itself is 3.2 eV and can increase in nanomaterials. Doping modifies the electronic structure and greatly accelerates the reactions. However, efficiency can be improved by using TiO2 nanotube array which provides a diffusion pathway without considerable scattering. When UV light was used on such an anode array the photoconversion efficiency as high as \u223c16 % was obtained.

Use of hydrogen has been considered as a good option particularly for the on-board application in the vehicles as H2 fuelled vehicles emit water molecules as their byproduct in a fuel cell. However storage of H2 is challenging as it occupies much larger volume compared to gasoline for the same amount of energy release. Storing hydrogen as a pressurized gas and carrying it on-board is not a suitable option for the vehicles. There are also problems with gas pumping stations availability at suitable locations. Therefore the scientists are since long looking for the suitable options for hydrogen storage. Some of the materials considered so far can be metal hydrides, complex hydrides, nanotubes, nanofibres, nanoparticles, polymer nanocomposites, aerogels doped with TiO2, Al2O3, MgO or Fe3O4 and Metal Organic Framework (MOF).",

The storing material should have at least 6 wt% H storage capability and operating temperature should be less than 400 K. In this respect the research on materials shows that many nanoparticles as well as porous materials are suitable. MgH2 nanoparticles with Al, Ni nanoparticles, LiBH4, LiBH4 + \u00bd ZnCl2 doped with 3\u201310 nm Ni nanoparticles, alloys of Mg-Ni-Al, Ca-B-Ti alloys in the form of nanoparticles are investigated as H2 storage materials. Various Alanates, particularly NaAlH4 and Na3AlH6, in the nanoform are also under investigations for their suitability as hydrogen storage materials. Carbon in various forms like carbon nanotubes, fullerenes or graphene along with other materials like NaAlH4, MgH2 or MgH2 + CNT + transition metal nanoparticles (<10 nm) hold a great promise as hydrogen storage materials. Fullerene C60 molecule alone is able to store 60 H atoms on its surface and some inside. It shows \u223c7.7 wt% hydrogen storage capacity but the hydrogen release temperature is larger than about 500 \u00b0C.

In the present scenario, therefore, it is necessary that we tap all the possible resources.

For each purpose separate cell is fabricated but can be used in isolation or simultaneously. Such cells need not be large but they are able to run cell phones, light emitting diodes, laptops etc. and they can take care of large load off of energy requirement.

The use of highly fluorescent colours from nano semiconductors is one possibility but even just by changing the distance between the particles or changing the size of the nanoparticles woven in the fibre one can change the colour of the clothes. This is because the optical properties of nanoparticles at wavelengths smaller than the wavelength of the incident light depend on their sizes.

The scattered light from such particles enables the location where the particles are attached. In fact this enables imaging combined with treatment. The silica-gold core-shell particles sizes can be tuned in such a way that there is maximum absorption of the laser power. This is possible (see Chap. 10.1007/978-3-319-09171-6_11, Sect. 10.1007/978-3-319-09171-6_11#Sec42) due to Surface Plasmon Resonance of gold nanolayer. The IR laser beams are available. The advantage of using IR is that it penetrates inside the body without affecting the body. Moreover, the laser power required to destroy the cancerous cells is half than that needed to destroy the healthy cells, so the laser is operated at low power anyway. The heat generated by the core-shell particles raises the local temperature which is sufficient to kill the cancer cell. \n",

Conventionally in the indocyanine green (ICG) dye an organic molecule is used in conjunction with infrared laser. However absorption is limited compared to now available gold nanoparticles (absorption is about 4\u20135 orders of magnitude more than dye molecules). Dyes also bleach fast or disintegrate. Gold nanoparticles on the other hand are quite stable. They can be tuned to desired/available laser wavelength in IR region, particularly if one uses different shapes like nanorod to tune the wavelength of absorption. Here the phenomenon of surface plasmon resonance (SPR) discussed in Chap. 10.1007/978-3-319-09171-6_7 is responsible for the strong absorption of light. The absorbed heat by the gold particles is used to heat the tissues which get sutured. This is joining of the tissues without stitches which reduces surgery related pain and infections.
