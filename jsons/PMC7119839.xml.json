Canine coronavirus (CCoV) belongs to one of the major antigenic groups of coronaviruses (Siddell et al., 1983, Spaan et al., 1988) and is related serologically and genetically to transmissible gastroenteritis virus of pigs, porcine epidemic diarrhoea virus, feline coronaviruses (FCoVs) and human coronavirus 229E (HcoV-229E) (Sanchez et al., 1990, Horsburgh et al., 1992, Wesseling et al., 1994). The viruses have enveloped virions containing a non-segmented, positive plus-stranded RNA genome that is 27\u201332 kb in length (Siddell, 1995) and is packaged by the nucleoprotein N (43 kDa) into a helical nucleocapsid. The ribonucleoprotein is surrounded by a lipid envelope which contains three viral glycoproteins: the spike S glycoprotein (160\u2013200 kDa) forming the long club-shaped surface projections on the virion surface, the integral M glycoprotein (29 kDa) and the small membrane (E) protein (9 kDa).",

Routine measurements of CCoV-specific antibodies are still based on the virus neutralisation test, which is costly as well as time-consuming (at least 4 days) and requires specialised laboratories. We carried out a preliminary comparison of the virus neutralisation and the Elisa and the findings clearly revealed a discrepancy between the results of the two tests, especially in evaluating CCoV seronegativity: 17 out of the 29 samples that were negative in virus neutralisation and positive at Elisa were confirmed to be positive by the Western blotting.",
