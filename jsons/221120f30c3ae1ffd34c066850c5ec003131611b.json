Determining and understanding genetic relationships among different TCoV isolates or strains is important for controlling the disease. Using two-step RT-PCR assays that amplify the full length of TCoV spike (S) gene, TCoV isolates can be sequenced, analyzed, and genotyped. Described in this chapter is the protocol on PCR amplifi cation and sequencing analysis of full-length TCoV S gene.

The major clinical signs of TCoV infection include depression, ruffl ed feathers, watery diarrhea, decreased body weight gain, and uneven fl ock growth. The most striking gross lesions are markedly distended intestine with gaseous and watery content, especially in the ileum and ceca. The salient histopathologic fi ndings include shortening of the intestinal villi, increase in crypt depth, and widening of intervillous spaces [ 1 ] . TCoV belongs to species Avian coronavirus of the genus Gammacoronavirus in the family Coronaviridae . The genome of TCoV is a linear positive-sense single-stranded RNA encoding three major structural proteins, including spike (S), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) protein. While M and N genes are conserved, S gene is a more common target used for coronavirus (CoV) differentiation because S gene is highly variable among different CoVs. The S gene sequences among different TCoV isolates (93-99.7 %) are relatively conserved as compared to different infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) strains, although both TCoV and IBV belong to the same species Avian coronavirus [ 6 -8 ] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 186, "end": 195, "text": "[ 1 , 2 ]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 205, "end": 210, "text": "[ 3 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 220, "end": 225, "text": "[ 4 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 239, "end": 244, "text": "[ 5 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 675, "end": 680, "text": "[ 1 ]", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 1351, "end": 1359, "text": "[ 6 -8 ]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Because the pair-wise comparison of S gene sequences revealed only 34 % of similarity between TCoV isolates and IBV strains while the remaining 3\u2032-end encoding region shared over 80 % of similarity, it has been suggested that TCoV arose through a recombination of S gene from IBV [ 6 , 9 -11 ] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 280, "end": 293, "text": "[ 6 , 9 -11 ]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "A protocol for PCR amplifi cation, sequencing , and sequence analysis of TCoV S gene for genotyping of TCoV isolates based on TCoV S gene sequences is highlighted in this chapter.

In step 2, TCoV RNA is extracted from intestines and reverse transcribed to cDNA. In step 3, the full-length S gene of TCoV is amplifi ed and sequenced. In step 4, the nucleotide sequence of the full-length S gene of TCoV is assembled from 12 sequence fragments fl anking the entire length of S gene. The S gene sequences of TCoV isolates and those from other coronaviruses published in GenBank are further analyzed by alignment and phylogenetic tree and thus TCoV genotypes are determined. 4.
