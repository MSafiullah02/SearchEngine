The earliest dental students in the Department of Dentistry of National Taiwan University were recruited in 1955 to open a new era of dental education in Taiwan. Although dentists are also a type of physician, the physicians under the \"Physician Law\" in Taiwan did not include dentists at that time. Until 1967, the Legislative Yuan in Taiwan passed the new \"Physician Law\", and then dentists were recognized as \"legal physicians\" under the new \"Physician Law\". However, the new \"Physician Law\" was formally implemented until 1975, after which the dentist was the only qualified dental practitioner with a dentist license. Since Japanese colonial period in 1916 (Taisho 5), the legal status of a dentist as a \"legal physician\" determined by \"Taiwan Dentist Ordinance\" has been delayed for almost 60 years. 1 So we know that the development of dentists in Taiwan has been over a century since the Japanese colonial period when the dentists were first recognized as having a professional position by law.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 960, "end": 961, "text": "1", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Since the establishment of the Department of Dentistry of National Taiwan University, after more than 60 years of development, there are now eight universities that have departments of dentistry -four in the northern, two in the central, and two in the southern regions of Taiwan. According to the statistics from the Ministry of Health and Welfare, the number of practicing dentists increased from 8944 in 2001 to 14, 717 in 2018, with a total growth rate of approximately 64.5% and an average annual growth rate of 2%w3%. Thus, the dentist manpower growth rate in Taiwan is relatively stable. 2 However, because the practicing styles of dentists and physicians in Taiwan are very different, for dentists more than 85% of them serve in dental clinics, and less than 15% serve in hospitals, but for physicians 36.5% of them serve in private clinics and 63.5% serve in hospitals. 3 A previous study found that the number of dentists in hospitals was 22% of the total number of dentists nationwide in 1986; this proportion decreased to 13% in 2004 and remained stable until 2008. Approximately half of the dentist manpower resources in hospitals concentrate in the northern region of Taiwan. In contrast, there are about 20% dentist manpower resources in the central region and 20% in the southern region of Taiwan. The eastern region and offshore islands have very few dentist manpower resources in Taiwan. 4 Meanwhile, dental clinics designated as training institutions and teaching hospitals (especially medical centers) are usually concentrated in the northern and urban areas of Taiwan. 5 It is consistent with the conclusions of a Japanese study reporting that prefectures with more dentists or dental clinics have a greater ability to offer postgraduate clinical training for dentists. 6 Therefore, how to balance the dentist manpower resources in different regions of Taiwan becomes a pivotal issue in the future. For example, in 2018, the eighth department of dentistry in a university was established in the southern part of Taiwan, due to the consideration of the balance of distribution of departments of dentistry in Taiwan. 3 Because there were few studies on dentist manpower development and geographical distribution of dentists in Taiwan, this study focused on the analysis of changes of the numbers of dentists who practiced in hospitals or dental clinics over the past 32 years, and compared the numbers of dentists in different levels of dental institutions located in different regions of Taiwan in 2019.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 415, "end": 418, "text": "14,", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 419, "end": 422, "text": "717", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 595, "end": 596, "text": "2", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 879, "end": 880, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1406, "end": 1407, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1590, "end": 1591, "text": "5", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1791, "end": 1792, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 2136, "end": 2137, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "In this study, we adopted the method of the secondary data analysis to collect the information about the numbers of practicing dentists, practicing physicians, and total population in Taiwan from 1986 to 2018, and the information regarding to the numbers of dentists in different levels of hospital and in dental clinics in 2019.
