Besides treatments with the Qingfei Paidu Decoction (QPD) and Qingjin Jianghuo Decoction (QJD) mentioned in the previous article [1] , many other TCM prescriptions used for COVID-19 patients in China have been reported to be effective, including Lianhua Qingwen Granule (LQG), Toujie Quwen granules (TQG), and Reyanning Mixture (RYM). Most of the published cases referred patients using TCM on the basis of chemical drug therapy. For example, Cheng Dezhong et al. [2] reported a study demonstrating the therapeutic efficacy of LQG combined with chemical drug therapy treating COVID-19 patients. For a 7-day treatment, the control group was given nutritional support, symptomatic treatment, antiviral and antibacterial drugs, and the treatment group was treated with LQG combined with nutritional support, and treatment with antiviral and antibacterial drugs. After 7 days, the disappearance rates of main symptoms (fever, fatigue, cough) in the treatment group were 83.7% (fever), 61.3% (fatigue) and 62.2% (cough), respectively, whereas in the control group they were 61.0%, 34.3% and 35.9%, respectively; the clinical effective rate (eliminating main symptoms) of the treatment group was 86.3% in comparison with the control group in which it was 68.6%.",

Currently, more than 180 prescriptions containing Scutellariae Radix are included in the latest version of Chinese Pharmacopoeia (2015). Scutellariae Radix is commonly used to treat diseases such as trachoma hepatitis, hypertension, acute respiratory infection, acute gastroenteritis, infantile diarrhea, vomiting during pregnancy and other diseases. [5] . Meng Xiangrui et al. [6] demonstrated that Qingfei Decoction (QFD, containing Scutellariae Radix, 15g/each, twice/day) combined with ulinastatin is effective in the treatment of severe pneumonia, which could increase serum TNF-alpha level and procalcitonin (PCT) expression. For a 10-day treatment, both the observation group and control group were given ulinastatin based on the conventional treatment, and additional QFD was given to the observation group. The effective rate of the observation group reached 93.4% which is significantly higher than the 83.5% measured in the control group, with a significance of \u03c7 2 =4.360, P=0.037. The adverse event rate in the observation group was 4.4 (4/91), which was significantly lower than 13.2 (12/91) in the control group, with a significance of \u03c7 2 =4.390, P=0.036. In an in vivo experiment, Zhi Hai-Juan et al. [7] reported the therapeutic effects of major flavonoids-enriched chemical components extracted from S. baicalensis root (FESR) on acute lung injury induced by influenza A virus. They also concluded that the underlying action mechanism might be closely associated with anti-inflammatory, antiviral and anti-complementary properties of FESR.",
