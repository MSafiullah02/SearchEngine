The re-emerging disease gives rise to thousands of deaths and enormous economic losses each year. The devastating results of the recent outbreaks of avian influenza in Europe and south East Asia demonstrate this immanent danger. The major problem in fighting the flu is the high genetic variability of the virus. This results in the rapid formation of variants that escape the acquired immunity against previous virus strains or confer resistance to anti-viral agents. Despite successful vaccination against circulating strains causing annual epidemics the number of admitted measures to fight acute infection in risk patients is limited and quarantine is of limited help as the virus transmitted before onset of symptoms. This poses an even greater challenge when a completely new virus should hit the human population without preexisting immunity and start a pandemic. Therefore the development of effective drugs against viral functions or essential cellular activities supporting viral replication is of outmost importance today.",

Epidemics appear almost annually and are due to an antigenic change of the viral surface glycoproteins (Fig. 1) . Furthermore, highly pathogenic strains of influenza-A-virus have emerged unpredictably but repeatedly in recent history as pandemics like the \"Spanish-Flu\" that caused the death of 20-40 millions people worldwide (Taubenberger et al., 2000; Webster, 1999) . Since these pandemic virus strains usually possess different antigenic characteristics, current vaccines will be ineffective once such a virus emerges. Regarding the vast possibilities for such a strain to \"travel\" around the world (Hufnagel et al., 2004) it becomes evident that effective countermeasures are required for the fight against these foes. In recent outbreaks of avian viruses that infected humans (1997, 1999, 2003/4/5) Hatta and Kawaoka, 2002; Li et al., 2004 ) from a total of 108 confirmed cases 54 people died (07/2005) (World Health Organization, 2005) . Fortunately, until now these particular viruses have not acquire the ability to spread in the human population. However, any novel virus strain emerging in the future may have such a capability (Webby and Webster, 2003) .",

The components of the RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase complex (RDRP), PB2, PB1 and PA are associated with the ribonucleoprotein complex (RNP) and are encoded by the vRNA segments 1-3. The PB1 segment of many, but not all, influenza-A-virus strains also contains a +1-reading frame encoding the recently discovered PB1-F2 protein (Chen et al., 2001) . The viral surface glycoproteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) are expressed from vRNA segments 4 and 6, respectively. The nucleoprotein (NP) is encoded by segment 5 and associates with the vRNA segments. It is the major component of the RNPs. The two smallest vRNA segments each code for two proteins. The matrix protein (M1) is colinear translated from the mRNA of segment 7 and forms an inner layer within the virion. A spliced version of the mRNA gives rise to a third viral transmembrane component, the M2 protein, which functions as a pH-dependent ion channel. Employing a similar coding strategy segment 8 harbors the sequence information for the nonstructural NS1 protein and the nuclear export protein NS2/NEP. NS2/NEP is a minor component of the virion and is found associated with the M1 protein. Figure 1 .

            "text": "The viral replication cycle is initiated by binding of the HA to sialic-acid (neuraminic acid) containing cellular receptors and subsequent endocytosis of the virus (Figure 2 ) (For references: (Lamb and Krug, 2001; Wright and Webster, 2001) ). The active HA molecule consists of two subunits (HA 1 / HA 2 ) derived from the uncleaved precursor HA 0 , which becomes proteolytically processed after release of the virion by extra-cellular proteases. This cleavage is absolutely essential for HA-function and cell infection. Virus disassembly occurs in the acidic environment of late endosomal vesicles and involves two crucial events. First, the conformation of the HA is changed to a low-pH form, which results in exposure of a fusion active protein sequence within the HA 2 . This fusion peptide is thought to contact the endosomal membrane and to initiate fusion with the viral envelope. Second, the low pH in the endosomes activates the viral M2 ion channel protein resulting in a flow of protons into the interior of the virion. Acidification facilitates dissociation of the RNPs from the M1 protein. The RNPs are subsequently released into the cytoplasm and rapidly imported into the nucleus through the nuclear pore complexes. The viral genomic segments are replicated and transcribed by the viral RDRP associated with the RNPs in the nucleus of the infected cell. The vRNA is directly transcribed to mRNA and, in addition, serves as a template for a complementary copy (cRNA), which itself is the template for new vRNA. In the late phase of infection newly synthesized viral RNPs are exported to the cytoplasm. NS1 protein functions as a regulatory factor in the virus infected cell. The NA, the M2 and the precursor HA (HA 0 ) proteins follow the exocytotic transport pathway from the rER via the Golgi complex and the trans Golgi network. The mature HA and NA glycoproteins and the nonglycosylated M2 are finally integrated into the plasma membrane as trimers (HA) or tetramers (NA, M2), respectively. M1 assembles in patches at the cell membrane. It is thought to associate with the glycoproteins (HA and NA) and to recruit the RNPs to the plasma membrane in the late phase of the replication cycle. Finally the viral RNPs become enveloped by a cellular bilipid layer carrying the HA, NA and M2 proteins resulting in budding of new virus particles from the apical cell surface. Replicative viral proteins enter the nucleus to amplify the viral genome. In the late stage of the infection cycle newly synthesized RNPs are exported from the nucleus and are assembled into progeny virions that bud from the cell surface.",

This includes conformational alteration of HA-and NA-epitopes against which neutralizing antibodies are generated. Influenza-A-viruses are categorized by antigenic differences of the HA-and NA-proteins. The high mutation rate combined with the high replication rate results in a multitude of new variants produced in each replication cycle, thus allowing the virus to rapidly adapt to changes in the environment. This results in an escape of the existing immunity and in resistance to drugs acting directly against viral functions. Gradual changes of the antigenic properties that make existing vaccines less or non effective are described as antigenic drift and demand for new compositions of the yearly vaccines.",

This is described as genetic reassortment. Today 16 HAsubtypes (H1-H16) and 9 NA-subtypes (N1-N9) are known, which can mix and lead to new antigenic properties. (Lamb and Krug, 2001; Webster et al., 1992; Wright and Webster, 2001) . Not all combination will ultimately be advantageous, but can lead to the generation of a virus that combines the ability to replicate in humans with novel antigenic properties (antigenic shift). This has happened at least three times in the last century resulting in the pandemics of 1918 (\"Spanish Flu\"), 1957 (\"Asian Flu\") and 1968 (\"Hong Kong Flu\") that caused up to 40 million death. Therefore, the question is not \"if\" but \"when\" will such a pandemic occur again (Horimoto and Kawaoka, 2001; Webby and Webster, 2003; Webster, 1997b) . A vaccine against such \"new\" viruses can not be generated in advance and as vaccine production would need significantly more time than it takes for a pandemic virus to spread around the world (Hufnagel et al., 2004) , alternative weapons in the fight against these enemies are urgently needed. Besides pandemic variants that can occur when human and avian influenza virus reassort in porcine hosts (regarded as \"mixing vessels\") (Webster, 1997a; Webster et al., 1997) , avian influenza virus strains have directly infected humans, as happened in Hong Kong in 1997 (Claas et al., 1998; de Jong et al., 1997; Subbarao et al., 1998 Subbarao et al., ) and recently (2004 Subbarao et al., /2005 Koopmans et al., 2004) during vast outbreaks of avian influenza. These viruses show an extremely high virulence in humans with case fatality rates up to 70%.",

Bacterial super-infections of the harmed tissue can further complicate the situation.

Together with the destruction of the epithelia this results in an influx of fluid into the aveolars leading to hypoxia and acute respiratory distress syndrome, that may cause the death within a short period of time (1-2 days after onset).

Consequently, the humoral immune response is the primary target of vaccination. After influenza virus infection antibodies directed against all major viral proteins can be detected in humans and the level of serum antibodies correlate with resistance to disease (Couch, 2003; Couch and Kasel, 1983; Coulter et al., 2003; Nichol et al., 1998; Potter and Oxford, 1979) . Only antibodies specific for the surface glycoproteins HA and NA are associated with resistance to infection. In contrast, antibodies to the conserved internal antigens M and NP are not protective (de Jong et al., 2003; Tamura and Kurata, 2004) . The mucosal tissues of the respiratory system are the main portal entry of influenza virus and consequently the mucosal immune system functions as the first line of defense against infection apart from innate immunity (see paragraph 4). Antibodies secreted locally in the upper respiratory tract are a major factor in resistance to natural infection. Secretory immunoglobulin A (SIgA) and to some extent IgM are the major neutralizing antibodies directed against the entering virus. Furthermore, these antibodies can function intra-cellular to inhibit influenza replication.

These vaccines have good safety and tolerance profiles, with very low number of adverse reactions reported. These reactions are tenderness and redness that arise locally at the injection site and are more frequent in healthy (<50%) than in elderly recipients (25%) . IVs are produced by propagation of the virus in embryonated chicken eggs. The currently used bacterial endotoxin-free trivalent IVs (TIV) are formulated with 15\u00b5g HA each from a current influenza virus A/H1N1, A/H3N2, and a B-virus strain. The seed strain is prepared by co-infecting the allantoic sac of the chicken embryo with a laboratory-adapted high-growth phenotype of H1N1 (A/PR/8/34) and the epidemic strain. This results in viral replication and genetic re-assortment leading to high growth reassortants. Thereafter the new hybrid viruses are screened for the absence of genes encoding PR/8 or PR/8-like surface glycoproteins. The selected seed strain containing HA-and NA-components of the epidemic strain is mass propagated in chicken eggs to obtain sufficient quantities of vaccine virus. The allantoic fluid is harvested, and the virus is concentrated and highly purified by zonal centrifugation. As a next step the virus is inactivated. Depending on the nature of inactivation the vaccine is used as whole inactivated vaccine after treatment with formalydehyde or \u03b2-propiolactone or as split vaccine (chemically disrupted by ethyl either or SDS). Furthermore, the vaccine is used as subunit vaccines (purified surface glycoproteins). Even though influenza vaccines have excellent tolerant profiles, since propagation in chicken eggs may lead to contamination of the vaccine with trace amounts of residual egg proteins, they should not be administered to persons who have anaphylactic hypersensitivity to eggs. Whole inactivated influenza vaccine is more immunogenic than split vaccine or subunit vaccine, but is also associated with more frequent side reactions. Consequently, split or subunit are given to children younger than age 9 and two half doses are recommended given at least 1 month apart for na\u00efve persons to develop protective immunity (Bridges et al., 2003) . Protection after vaccination against influenza virus infection is dependent on the antigenic match between the vaccine strains and circulating the influenza virus strain. Moreover, protection is also dependent the age and the previous exposition to influenza of the vaccine recipient. If IVs have a good antigenic match they are 60-90% effective in the prevention of morbidity and mortality among healthy adults (Beyer et al., 2002) . In elderly people the effect of protection is reduced to 50-70% because of decreased immune function. Since the immune system is na\u00efve in young children, they also show a reduction in protection against influenza vaccination (Nichol et al., 1998) .",

Production of influenza vaccine in mammalian cell lines has some advantages but also has disadvantages compared to production in chicken egg. (Tree et al., 2001; Youil et al., 2004) . Process controllability, scalability and supply of substrates are much easier in cell culture systems. Furthermore, cell culture production reduces the risk of microbial contamination. In contrast, the greatest disadvantage of cell culture based influenza vaccine is the relative low viral yield. On the other hand and a major disadvantage of production in chicken eggs is their supply and possible bacterial contaminations. Additionally the lethality of H5N1 influenza virus to chicken embryos (s. 3.1.3). At the present (2005) two cell line derived vaccines have been licensed in Europe . Estimated time for production of such vaccines is about 6 months. The power of this time gaining approach to generate a great variety of specific influenza-vaccines under controlled safety conditions is achieved by the direct use of field strains (Kistner et al., 1998) as well as seed strains specifically designed by reverse genetics systems and the large scale cell culture system.

These reconstituted virus-like particles (VLP; diameter 150nm) contain a lipid bilayer of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine. HA and NA are intercalated into the lipid bilayer and give the IRIVs their fusogenic activity, but lack the viral genetic material. IRIVs are able to deliver proteins, RNA/DNA and peptides to immunocompetent cells. In addition, virosomes, as vaccine delivery systems, have been shown to be safe and not to engender any antibodies against the phospholipid components. Therefore, their use in vaccination of children and elderly people is recommended. The system is already registered for human use and allows a specific targeting of antigens by a cellular or a humoral immune response. A virosome vaccine, Inflexal-V, is used in Switzerland and Italy. (Gluck et al., 2004; Langley and Faughnan, 2004; Zurbriggen, 2003) .",

Additional cytokines produced by the infected cells during the innate immunity response enhance and support reaction of the humoral system.

This results in a limited viral replication in the upper and lower respiratory tract and circumvents the need for syringes. It also supports protective mucosal immunity, which is an important property of nasally applied live influenza virus vaccines. For the generation of a CAV a donor and a wild type strain are reassorted in such a way, that the HA-and NA-segments are wild type (wt) derived and the remaining six segments originate from the donor strain. For this purpose two master strains are currently used as donors in the USA. One to generate A-type and one B-type influenza CAVs (Mendelman et al., 2001; Murphy and Coelingh, 2002) . These strains are cold adapted (25\u00b0C) (Kendal, 1997; Maassab and Bryant, 1999) and therefore temperature sensitive (ts) and attenuated, meaning that these viruses will not propagate efficiently at body temperatures. To prevent easy reversion of the genetic markers, that encode the ts-defect and allowing the virus to regain full virulence, all six donor-derived segments carry mutations.",

            "text": "In addition to the traditional live attenuated vaccines, production by reverse genetics (s. 3.1.3) of replication-incompetent influenza virus-like particles (VLPs) by deletion of either the entire NS gene (encoding both the NS1 and NS2 protein) or only the NS2 gene has also been reported. These VLPs were entirely produced from cDNAs (Watanabe et al., 2002b) . Although, these technologies are in the very early stages of development and so far only tested in animal models, the VLP incapable of replication and spread to other cells due to deletion of a major protion of the NS1 or M2, are expected to be good novel influenza vaccine candidates (Galarza et al., 2005; Watanabe et al., 2002a) . A variation of the theme is presented by influenza virus strains (generated by reverse genetics (s. 3.1.3)) that express a modified NS1 (Palese and Garcia-Sastre, 2002; Palese et al., 1999; Talon et al., 2000) . This non-structural protein is the major viral interferon (IFN)antagonist (s. Tab. 1). Even though NS1 is a multifunctional viral protein that supports viral replication it seems to be an accessory protein as a virus without the NS1-gene can replicate in IFN-deficient systems (Garcia-Sastre et al., 1998a; Garcia-Sastre et al., 1998b; Ludwig et al., 1999) . IFN\u03b1/\u03b2 are two important cytokines expressed in primary infected epithelia cells, that induce innate immunity. IFN\u03b1/\u03b2-induction severely reduces viral replication even in the presence of NS1. Therefore recombinant viruses expressing altered NS1 with reduced capacity to suppress cellular IFN-induction could raise protective immunity and might represent interesting attenuated live vaccine candidates (Talon et al., 2000) . Such viruses have been generated by reverse genetic techniques (s. 3.1.3) and have been successfully tested in experimental settings .",

(I) For the production of regular IVs against wild type strains, that either grow poorly or are too pathogenic in eggs (s. later) one can generate strains carrying the HA and NA needed in the background of an egg adapted virus. This is normally done by reassortment of the wild type with the egg-adapted strain and can not be well controlled. This problem can be circumvented by plasmid based reverse genetics that allow the controlled design of the reassortant. (II) As mentioned the CAV are composed of HA-and NA-genes from the wild type in the production of infectious influenza viruses (for review: Garcia-Sastre, strain and a mixture of the other six segments from wild type and donor virus. By choice of the according plasmids one can compose a CAV-strain that carries all six segments from the donor strain each with an adaptive mutation. This way it is less likely that a revertant virus will arise by mutation in one of the donor strain segments (s. 3.1.2) (Maassab and Bryant, 1999; Schickli et al., 2001) . (III) It is possible to specifically design viruses with altered NS1-genes that could be used as highly attenuated life vaccines (s. 3.1.2), additionally modification of other viral genes (Murphy et al., 1997; Parkin et al., 1997) or of the replications efficiency of the genesegment (Muster et al., 1991) can be applied to further attanuate the virus. (IV) Viruses could be produced that lack an essential gene (e.g. NEP) (Watanabe et al., 2002b) . The missing gene-product can be transcomplemented from an expression-plasmid in the transfected cell during virus generation. The recombinant viruses would be still infectious and lead to expression and presentation of viral proteins, but could not themselves establish a productive propagation as they are lacking the according gene.",

As mentioned earlyer (3.1.1), one particular problem that could arise would be production of a vaccine strain against an highly pathogenic avain influenza virus like the types that have recently infected humans. Besides bio-safety questions they pose further problems. The HA of these viruses is activated within the infected cell by ubiquitous proteases allowing the virus to spread through out the organism. Due to the special HAcharacteristics these viruses themselves are highly pathogenic birds and eggs as well as a vaccine strain that would carry the according HA. Therefore efficient virus production in embryonated eggs will be problematic (Lipatov et al., 2004) . By plasmid based reverse genetic techniques recombinant viruses can be produced that have lost the pathogenic character of the HA and can replicate well in eggs Li et al., 1999; Liu et al., 2003; Subbarao et al., 2003) . This could additionally be combined with virus production in cell culture systems (s. p. 12) Romanova et al., 2004) thereby overcoming the limitation posed by the number of embryonated eggs available at a given time (Stephenson et al., 2004) .",

Specifically, the adamantane compounds inhibit the acidification of the virion inside the endosome, which prevents the intra-cellular release of the viral RNPs. The 50% inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) of most natural influenza-A-virus strains against adamantane compounds is in the range of 0.2 to 0.4 \u00b5g/ml as determined by plaque reduction assay (Appleyard et al., 1977; Hayden et al., 1980; Scholtissek and Faulkner, 1979) . Amantadine and rimantadine have proven effectiveness in the treatment of uncomplicated influenza-A-virus infection. They can reduce the duration of fever and system symptoms by approximately one day when given within two days after onset of disease signs (Demicheli et al., 2000; Tominack and Hayden, 1987) . Furthermore, both substances also have prophylactic effectiveness in reducing influenza-associated morbidity and clinical symptoms. A survey of studies undertaken with healthy adults demonstrated average effectiveness of 61% for amantadine and 72% for rimantadine in preventing laboratory confirmed influenza (Demicheli et al., 2000) . During long-term prophylaxis amantadine was found to cause mild reversible adverse effects in a small proportion of the recipients, which involved central nervous system (CNS) and minor gastrointestinal complaints. No increase in side effects was observed during treatment with rimantadine compared to placebo (N.N., 1985) .",

One study found that a total of 27% of children with laboratory-confirmed influenza shed resistant viruses after seven days of treatment with rimantadine (Hall et al., 1987) . Unfortunately, such selected drug-resistant viruses are virulent, as they can transmit to family members and cause disease even when the contact persons were treated prophylactically with rimantadine (Hayden et al., 1989) . Viruses that become insensitive to amantadine show complete cross-resistance to rimantadine and vice versa. Thus, the clinical usage of adamantane amine compounds has been limited by the reported adverse effects, the induction of viral drug resistance and the inactivity towards influenza-B-viruses. Nevertheless, these drugs are still recommended as a cost-effective choice particularly in influenza chemoprophylaxis (Harper et al., 2004) . It is noteworthy, that amantadine resistance has also been detected in the highlypathogenic H5N1 viruses currently circulating in South East Asia (Puthavathana et al., 2005) . Thus, adamantane compounds are not an option to treat such infections.",

Only amantadine is licensed for treatment of children between 1 and 9 years and should be dosed with 5 mg/kg per day. In order to avoid emergence and transmission of drug-resistent viruses, treatment should be kept to a minimal time of 3 to 5 days until disease symptoms disappear. Chemoprophylaxis can be considered for protection among high-risk groups including children and adults with chronic pulmonary or cardiac disease, immunocompromised persons with a reduced response to vaccines or in the case of a poor match between an epidemic virus strain and the current vaccine. Since the adamantane compounds do not interfere with the development of neutralizing antibodies (Tominack and Hayden, 1987) , they can also be used for the protection of persons at high risk to bridge the time gap between vaccination and the establishment of an efficient immune status. For adults and children older than 9 years two 100 mg doses of amantadine or rimantadine per day are recommended. Children between 1 and 9 years should receive a maximum of 150 mg per day in two divided doses.",

The current knowledge suggests that NAinhibitors (NI) will have a better clinical utility than the M2-blockers, because these substances are broadly effective against type-A and -B influenza viruses including highly virulent avian virus strains. Further, they appear to have a very low frequency of adverse effects and are less prone to induce drug resistance. Zanamivir and oseltamivir function as slow binding, substrate competitive inhibitors that strongly reduce viral NA-activity by interacting with five sub-sites close to the enzymatic pocket of the NA. The IC 50 values of these inhibitors were found to be in the range of 0.8 -8.8 nM depending on the virus types and subtypes (McKimm-Breschkin et al., 2003) .",

Influenza viruses attach to the host cell through binding of the viral HA to sialic acid moieties that are conjugated to cellular glycoproteins. By the time of progeny virus budding these receptor determinants need to be removed to allow efficient release from the host cell. This is accomplished by the viral NA (acylneuraminyl hydrolase, EC 3.2.1.18) that hydrolyzes glycosidic linkages adjacent to N-acetyl-neuraminic acid (Neu5Ac, sialic acid). Thus, blockade of NA-activity by antibodies, temperature-sensitive mutation or inhibitory substances results in the aggregation of budding virions at the cell membrane and, hence, reduction of virus release (Compans et al., 1969; Palese and Compans, 1976; Palese et al., 1974) . In infected animals or humans, NA probably also enhances penetration of the virion through the viscous mucus on respiratory epithelia, which contains sialic acids (Matrosovich et al., 2004) . Thus, inhibition of viral NA-activity was the rationale behind several efforts to identify substances that would reduce influenza virus spread and replication.",

Neu 5Ac2en had been shown to inhibit viral NA-acitvity but was not protective in a mouse model of influenza (Palese and Schulman, 1977) . Based upon computer-assisted drug design, von Itzstein et al. demonstrated that the introduction of positively charged amino-or guanidino moieties at position 4 of Neu 5Ac2en increased NA inhibition by two to four orders of magnitude (von Itzstein et al., 1993) . Importantly, the inhibition of NAactivity by 4 guanidino-Neu5Ac2en that is now also termed zanamivir translated into efficient reduction of viral replication of type-A and Binfluenza viruses in the nanomolar range in vitro and dose-dependent decrease of viral titers in infected animals (von Itzstein et al., 1993; Woods et al., 1993) . Zanamivir has low oral bioavailability, but shows high antiviral activity in humans or animals when administered topically by inhalation of dry-powder aerosol (Cass et al., 1999) . The second currently approved NA inhibitor compound oseltamivir (3R,4R,5S-4acetamido-5-amino-3-(1-ethylpropoxyl)-1-cyclohexene-1carboxylic acid\u00b8 also termed GS4071/Ro64-0802) has similarly potent activities against type A and B influenza viruses . Oseltamivir emerged from an independent NA structure-based study and is based on a cyclohexen ring structure in which the polar glycerol side chain of the sialic acid analogues is replaced by a lipophilic 3-pentyloxy moiety (Kim et al., 1997) . Importantly, oseltamivir has high oral anti-viral activity when administered as its methylester pro-drug, GS4071/oseltamivir phosphate, that is converted to the active drug by hepatic enzymes (Hayden et al., 1999b; Li et al., 1998; Mendel et al., 1998) .",

            "text": "Zanamivir and oseltamivir have potent anti-viral effectiveness against community-acquired influenza and are in general safe to use in healthy adults (Abramson, 1999; Boivin et al., 2000; Hayden et al., 1997; Makela et al., 2000; Monto et al., 1999; N.N., 1985) . In clinical trials the NIs significantly shortened disease duration and reduced symptoms and viral loads when treatment was initiated within 26 hours post infection (Hayden et al., 1996; Hayden et al., 1999b) . Even, when inhalation of zanamivir was begun within 30 hours after onset of symptoms the time to alleviation of major disease signs (cough, myalgias, fever, headache) was shortened by one to two days and patients were able to resume normal activities earlier (Hayden et al., 1997; Monto et al., 1999) . Initiation of therapy later than 30 hours after disease onset still reduced viral loads but was less beneficial for symptom recovery. Two 75 mg daily doses of oseltamivir for five days were shown to reduce shedding of virus and the severity and duration of influenza symptoms by one to two days when therapy was begun within 36 hours after onset of disease signs (Nicholson et al., 2000; Treanor et al., 2000) . Some side effects that included diarrhea, nausea and nasal symptoms were observed during clinical testings of zanamivir but were similar in placebo groups (GlaxoWellcome, 2001) . The NI substances are also highly effective to prevent spread of the disease. A post-exposure protection study with zanamivir demonstrated 79% efficacy in preventing transmission of influenza to family members, when the index case was treated with zanamivir . Oseltamivir had a comparably high efficacy in preventing laboratory-confirmed influenza by 74% and influenza with fever by 82% (Hayden et al., 1999a) . Within households, one 75 mg dose oseltamivir per day was 89% protective against clinical influenza even when the index cases were not treated (Welliver et al., 2001) . Thus, to prevent the spread of the flu within household contacts the NIs appear to be preferable compared to the M2-blockers that can induce the emergence and transmission of virulent drug-resistant viruses.",

Under laboratory conditions several passages are usually required to select such variants, which is different to amantadine-resistant viruses that can emerge in a single cycle experiment. Drug-resistant viruses were also isolated from diseased persons treated with NIs (Gubareva et al., 2001; Gubareva et al., 1998; Kiso et al., 2004; Zambon and Hayden, 2001) .

            "text": "Resistance to NIs was found to be complex, because it can be associated with mutations in the NA, the HA or synergistically in both genes. NAmutations that confer reduced drug sensitivity were identified at amino acid residues 119, 152, 274, 292 and 294 (based on N2-NA numbering) (Gubareva, 2004; Zambon and Hayden, 2001) . These amino acids are part of or cluster around the conserved catalytic pocket and their mutation can decrease the enzymatic activity to below 5% and some also destabilize the enzyme (Varghese et al., 1998) . The various NI-molecules slightly differ in their interactions with the enzyme. Thus, a given NA-mutant enzyme may show a range of sensitivity against different inhibitors (Gubareva et al., 2001) . Interestingly, some viruses with a reduced sensitivity to NIs were found to carry mutations in the HA, which affected the receptor binding site in the globular head region, the stalk region and the HA 2 -subunit (McKimm-Breschkin, 2000) . Apparently, the HA-mutations reduce drug sensitivity by decreasing the affinity for cellular sialic acid receptor molecules and thereby easing the release of budding viruses from the plasma membrane. These findings corroborate the concept that efficient viral replication requires a carefully balanced interplay between the strength of HA/receptor binding and the activity of the NA that removes these receptor determinants .",

Therapy with either drug should be initiated within 48 hours after the onset of disease signs and should be continued for five days (GlaxoWellcome, 2001; Roche, 2001) . It is important to consider that bacterial superinfections may occur that would not be affected by these anti-virals. Neither substance has been shown to prevent serious complications of influenza like pneumonia. Zanamivir is approved for treatment of influenza in persons aged 7 years and older. The recommended dosage is two inhalations of 5 mg doses twice a day using the inhalation device provided by the manufacturer. Zanamivir is not recommended for persons with underlying respiratory conditions like asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, because of the risk of precipitating bronchospasm in such patients (GlaxoWellcome, 2001) . Oseltamivir can be used for treatment of patients of 1 year or older. Depending on the age, the recommended doses for children above 12 years and adults are two 75 mg capsules a day. Two daily doses of 15 -30 mg is recommended for children under 15 kg, 2 x 45 mg for children between 15-23 kg and 2 x 60 mg for persons weighing >23-40 kg. Currently, Tamiflu\u2122 but not Relenza\u2122 is licensed for chemoprophylaxis in children older than 12 years and in adults. For persons with creatinine clearance of 10-30 ml/min, halving of the usual dosage for therapy or prophylaxis is recommended. Two approaches are possible, a seasonal prophylaxis that provides a 92% reduction of confirmed influenza infection in a vaccinated population of frail elderly persons (McClellan and Perry, 2001) , and a short-term prophylaxis for controlling institutional outbreaks by breaking the virus circulation.",

First, the polymerase exhibits an endonuclease activity that cleaves the first 10 -13 nucleotides including the 5'-cap structure from nascent host RNA-polymerase II cap transcripts and use them to prime viral mRNAs (Lamb and Krug, 2001) . Second, the viral polymerase replicates the negative-sense viral RNA-segments via unprimed synthesis of a complementary positive-strand RNA-intermediate. For both of these activities, inhibitory small molecule compounds have been identified, some of which were also shown to reduce viral propagation in tissue culture and/or in infected mice. However, further clinical development has not been reported for any of those substances so far.",

It has been shown that derivatives of the fungal metabolite flutimide as well as a class of 4substituted 2,4-dioxobutanoic acids specifically inhibited the cap-dependent endonuclease, presumably by interaction with the active catalytic site of the enzyme (Hastings et al., 1996; Parkes et al., 2003; Tomassini et al., 1994; Tomassini, 1996) .

T-705 showed IC 50 values of less than 0.5 \u00b5g/ml in virus yield assays in MDCK cells against all three influenza virus types (A, B, C) with no signs of cytotoxicity (Furuta et al., 2002) . Importantly, T-705 was also orally active in a mouse model and shown to significantly reduce viral lung titers and enhance survival rates from 20% to 100% after infection with influenza virus A/PR/8/34 virus at a dose of 200 mg/kg per day (Furuta et al., 2002; Takahashi et al., 2003) . Although the basis for its anti-viral activity was unclear at that time, T-705 was found to inhibit replication of an oseltamivirresistant mutant virus in vitro suggesting that this inhibitor targets a different viral function (Takahashi et al., 2003) . Indeed, recent analyses showed that the compound is metabolized inside the cell into T-705-ribofuranosyl-5'triphosphate (T-705-RTP), which is a potent and selective inhibitor of ApGprimed viral RNA-polymerase activity (Furuta et al., 2005) . These findings show that T-705 may have the potential to become a novel oral antiinfluenza drug that targets a viral function not blocked by one of the currently licensed NIs or M2-blockers.",

Four different members of the MAPK-family that are organized in separate cascades have been identified so far: ERK (extra-cellular signal regulated kinase), JNK (Jun-N-terminal kinase), p38 and ERK5/BMK-1 (Big MAP kinase) (Garrington and Johnson, 1999; Widmann et al., 1999) . These MAPKs are activated by a dual phosphorylation event on threonine and tyrosine mediated by MAPK-kinases (MAPKK also termed MEKs or MKKs). The MAPK \"ERK\" is activated by the dual-specific MAPKK MEK1 and -2 that are controlled by the upstream serine threonine MAPKKkinase Raf. Raf, MEK and ERK form the prototype module of a MAPK-pathway and are also known as the classical mitogenic cascade. The MAPK p38 and JNK are activated by MKK3/6 and MKK4/7, respectively, and are predominantly activated by pro-inflammatory cytokines and certain environmental stress conditions. The MEK5/ERK5 module is both activated by mitogens and certain stress inducers. There is evidence that all these different MAPK-cascades are activated upon infection with RNA-viruses, including influenza viruses. Thus, these signaling cascades may serve different functions in viral replication and host cell response.",

The NF\u03baB/I\u03baB family of transcription factors promote the expression of well over 150 different genes, such as cytokine or chemokine genes, or genes encoding for adhesion molecules or anti-and pro-apoptotic protein (Pahl, 1999) . The canonical mechanism of NF\u03baB activation includes activation of I\u03baB-kinase (IKK) that phosphorylates the inhibitor of NF\u03baB (I\u03baB) and targets the protein for subsequent degradation (Delhase and Karin, 1999; Karin, 1999b) . This leads to the release and migration of the transcriptionally active NF\u03baB factors to the nucleus (Ghosh, 1999; Karin and Ben-Neriah, 2000) . The IKK-complex consists of at least three isozymes of IKK: (I) IKK1/IKK\u03b1, (II) IKK2/IKK\u03b2 and (III) NEMO/IKK\u03b3. The most important isozyme for NF\u03baB-activation via the degradation of I\u03baB is IKK2 (Karin, 1999a) . NEMO acts as a scaffolding protein for the large IKK complex (Courtois et al., 2001 ) that contains still other kinases such as MEKK1 (MAPKK-kinase 1) (Lee et al., 1998) , NIK (NF\u03baB inducing kinase) (Nemoto et al., 1998; Woronicz et al., 1997) and the dsRNAactivated protein-kinase (PKR) (Gil et al., 2000; Zamanian-Daryoush et al., 2000) .",

IFN\u03b2 is one of the first antiviral cytokines to be expressed upon virus infection, initiating an autoamplification loop to cause an efficient and strong type-I IFN response. The IFN\u03b2 enhanceosome, which mediates the inducible expression of IFN\u03b2, carries binding sites for transcription factors of three families, namely the AP-1 family members and JNK targets c-Jun and ATF-2, the NF\u03baB factors p50 and p65, and the interferon-regulatory factors (IRFs) (Hiscott et al., 1999; Thanos and Maniatis, 1995) . In the initial phase of a virus infection this promoter element specifically binds the constitutively expressed and specifically activated IRF3-dimer (Taniguchi and Takaoka, 2002) . AP-1and NF\u03baB-transcription factors are activated by a variety of stimuli. However, a strong IRF3-activation is selectively induced upon infection with several RNA-viruses, in particular by the dsRNA, which accumulates during replication Yoneyama et al., 1998) .

            "text": "The activation of the MAP-kinase ERK upon productive influenza virus infection (Kujime et al., 2000) appears to serve a mechanism that is beneficial for the virus . Strikingly, blockade of the pathway by specific inhibitors of the upstream kinase MEK and dominantnegative mutants of ERK or the MEK-activator Raf resulted in a strongly impaired growth of both, influenza A-and B-type viruses . Conversely, virus titers are enhanced in cells expressing active mutants of Raf or MEK Olschlager et al., 2004) . This has not only been demonstrated in cell culture but also in vivo in infected mice expressing a constitutively active form of the Raf-kinase in the alveolar epithelial cells of the lung (Olschlager et al., 2004) . While in the wt-situation influenza viruses primarily infect bronchiolar epithelial cells, there is efficient replication in the alveolar layer most exclusively in the cells carrying the transgene. As a consequence this results in an earlier death of the transgenic animals (Olschlager et al., 2004) . This indicates that activation of the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway is required for efficient virus growth. Noticeably, inhibition of the pathway did not significantly affect viral RNA-or protein-synthesis . The pathway rather appears to control the active nuclear export of the viral RNP-complexes that are readily retained in the nucleus upon blockade of the signaling pathway. Most likely this is due to an impaired activity of the viral nuclear export protein NEP . This indicates that active RNP-export is an induced rather than a constitutive event, a hypothesis supported by a late activation of ERK in the viral life cycle. So far the detailed mechanism of how ERK regulates export of the RNPs is unsolved. There are two likely scenarios: Either it does occur directly via phosphorylation of a viral protein involved in RNP-transport or by control of a cellular export factor. Although in the initial studies no alteration of the overall phosphorlyation status of the NP, M and NEP proteins was observed there are now first indications that certain phosphorylation sites of the NP indeed are affected by MEK-inhibition (S.P., unpublished data). It remains to be shown, whether this is of functional relevance for the RNP-export process. It is striking that MEK-inhibitors are not toxic for the cell, while more general blockers of the active transport machinery, such as leptomycin-B exert a high toxicity even in quite low concentrations. This may indicate that MEKinhibitors are no general export blockers but only block a distinct nuclear export pathway. Indeed there are first evidences that the classical mitogenic cascade specifically regulates nuclear export of certain cellular RNA-protein complexes. In LPS-treated mouse macrophages MEK-inhibition results in a specific retention of the TNF-mRNA in the nucleus (Dumitru et al., 2000) . This is also observed in cells deficient for Tpl-2, an activator of MEK and ERK. In these cells the failure to activate MEK and ERK by LPS again correlated with TNF mRNA retention while other cytokines are normally expressed (Dumitru et al., 2000) . Thus the ERK-pathway may regulate a specific cellular export process but leaves other export mechanisms unaffected. It is likely that such a specific export pathway is employed by influenza-A and B-viruses.",

Besides the anti-viral action against both, A-and B-type viruses , MEK-inhibitors meet two further criteria which are a prerequisite for a potential clinical use. Although targeting an important signaling pathway in the cell the inhibitors showed a surprisingly little toxicity (a) in cell culture Planz et al., 2001; Pleschka et al., 2001) (b) in an in vivo mouse model (Sebolt-Leopold et al., 1999) and (c) in clinical trials for the use as anti-cancer agent (Cohen, 2002) . In the light of these findings it was hypothesized that the mitogenic pathway may only be of major importance during early development of an organism and may be dispensable in adult tissues (Cohen, 2002) . Another very important feature of MEK-inhibitors is that they showed no tendency to induce formation of resistant virus variants . Although targeting of a cellular factor may still raise the concern about side effects of a drug, it appears likely that local administration of an agent such as a MEK-inhibitor to the primary site of influenza virus infection, the lung, is well tolerated. Here the drug primarily affects differentiated lung epithelial cells for which a proliferative signaling cascade like the Raf/MEK/ERK-cascade may be dispensable. Following this approach it was recently demonstrated that the MEK inhibitor U0126 is effective in reducing virus titers in the lung of infected mice after local administration (O.P., S.P. and S.L., unpublished).",

Beside a regulation of the Raf/MEK/ERK-cascade and other downstream pathways, PKCs may have additional functions during viral replication. A role of PKCs in the process of entry of several enveloped viruses has been proposed based on the action of protein kinase inhibitors H7 and staurosporine (Constantinescu et al., 1991) as well as by the calcium-channel blocker verapamil (Nugent and Shanley, 1984) . Influenza virus infection or treatment of cells with purified viral HA results in rapid activation of PKCs upon binding to host-cell surface receptors (Arora and Gasse, 1998; Kunzelmann et al., 2000; Rott et al., 1995) . In a recent study it was shown that the pan PKC-inhibitor bisindolylmaleimide-I prevented influenza virus entry and subsequent infection in a dose dependent and reversible manner (Root et al., 2000) . Using a dominant-negative mutant approach this function was assigned to the PKC\u00dfII-isoform. Overexpression of a phosphorylation-deficient mutant of PKC\u00dfII revealed that the kinase is a regulator of late endosomal sorting. Accordingly, expression of the PKC\u00dfII-mutant resulted in a block of virus entry at the level of late endosomes (Sieczkarski et al., 2003; Sieczkarski and Whittaker, 2002) . Thus, a specific inhibition of PKC\u00dfII may be a suitable approach to blunt virus replication at a very early time point in the replication cycle.",

Accordingly, influenza virus-induced IFN\u03b2promoter activity is impaired in cells expressing transdominant negative mutants of IKK2 or I\u03baB\u03b1 (Wang et al., 2000; Wurzer et al., 2004) .",

Conversely, influenza virus titers from different host cells in which NF\u03baB-signaling was impaired by means of specific inhibitors or dominantnegative mutants, a dramatic reduction could be observed (Nimmerjahn et al., 2004; Wurzer et al., 2004) . Thus, in the context of an influenza virus infection a function of NF\u03baB to support virus replication appears to be dominant over the function as a transcription factor in the anti-viral response. On a molecular basis this was shown to be due to the NF\u03baBdependent expression of pro-apoptotic factors, such as TNF-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL) or FasL . Inhibition of virus induced expression of these factors results in strongly impaired viral growth. This links the pro-viral action of NF\u03baB to the induction of apoptosis, a process that will be discussed in the next section. Finally, viral need for NF\u03baB-activity suggests that this pathway may be suitable as a target for anti-viral intervention. To this end we have shown recently that several pharmacological inhibitors of NF\u03baB act anti-viral in vivo, without toxic side effects or the tendency to induce resistant virus variants (I. Mazur, W. Wurzer, C. Erhardt, T. Silberzahn, T.W., O.P., S.P. and S.L, unpublished).",

Apoptosis is a morphological and biochemical defined form of cell death (Kerr et al., 1972) and has been demonstrated to play a role in a variety of diseases, including virus infections (Razvi and Welsh, 1995) . Apoptosis is mainly regarded to be a host cell defense against virus viruses (reviewed in: Julkunen et al., 2000; Ludwig et al., 2003; infections since many viruses express anti-apoptotic proteins to prevent this cellular response. The central component of the apoptotic machinery is a proteolytic system consisting of a family of cysteinyl proteases, termed Two groups of caspases can be distinguished: upstream initiator caspases such as caspase-8 or caspase-9, which cleave and activate other caspases and downstream effector caspases, including caspase-3, -6 and -7, that cleave a variety of cellular substrates, thereby disassembling cellular structures or inactivating enzymes (Thornberry and Lazebnik, 1998) . Caspase-3 is the most intensively studied effector caspase. Work on caspase-3 deficient MCF-7 breast carcinoma cells has revealed a caspase-3 driven feedback loop, that is crucial to mediate the apoptotic process (Janicke et al., 1998; Slee et al., 1999) . Thus, caspase-3 is a central player in apoptosis regulation and the level of pro-caspase-3 in the cell determines the impact of a given apoptotic stimulus.",

Interestingly, viral activation of MAPKs or upstream kinases has been linked to the onset of apoptosis. In a mouse model for a neurovirulent influenza infection, JNKactivity correlated with apoptosis induction in the infected brain (Mori et al., 2003) . In embryonic fibroblasts deficient for the MAPKK-kinase ASK-1 the virus-induced JNK-activation was blunted concomitant with an inhibition of caspase-3 activation and virus-induced apoptosis (Maruoka et al., 2003) . As an extrinsic mechanism of viral apoptosis induction it has been noted quite early on that the Fas receptor/FasL-apoptosis inducing system (Fujimoto et al., 1998; Takizawa et al., 1995; Takizawa et al., 1993; Wada et al., 1995) is expressed in a PKR-dependent manner in infected cells (Takizawa et al., 1996) . This most likely contributes to virus-induced cell death via a receptor mediated FADD/caspase-8-dependent pathway (Balachandran et al., 2000) . Another mode of viral apoptosis induction might occur via activation of TGF-\u03b2 that is converted from its latent form by the viral NA (Schultz-Cherry and . Within the influenza virus infected cell the apoptotic program is mediated by activation of caspases (Lin et al., 2002; Takizawa et al., 1999; Zhirnov et al., 1999) with a most crucial role of caspase-3 (Wurzer et al., 2003) .",

            "text": "2001). PB1-F2 induces apoptosis via the mitochondrial pathway if added to cells and infection with recombinant viruses lacking the protein results in reduced apoptotic rates of lymphocytes (Chen et al., 2001) . However, most of the avian virus strains are lacking the PB1-F2 reading frame and PB1-F2deficient viruses do not affect apoptosis in a variety of other host cells (Chen et al., 2001) . These results have let to the assumption that apoptosis induction by PB1-F2 may be required for the specific depletion of lymphocytes during an influenza virus infection, a process which is observed in infected animals (Tumpey et al., 2000; Van Campen et al., 1989a; Van Campen et al., 1989b) . A recent study adds a new aspect to the open discussion by the surprising observation that influenza virus propagation was strongly impaired in the presence of caspase inhibitors (Wurzer et al., 2003) . This dependency on caspase activity was most obvious in cells where caspase-3 was partially knocked-down by siRNA (Wurzer et al., 2003) . Consistent with these findings, poor replication efficiencies of influenza-A-viruses in cells deficient for caspase-3 could be boosted 30-fold by ectopic expression of the protein. Mechanistically, the block in virus propagation appeared to be due to the retention of viral RNP-complexes in the nucleus preventing formation of progeny virus particles (Wurzer et al., 2003) . Interestingly the findings are consistent with a much earlier report showing that upon infection of cells over expressing the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2 the viral RNP-complexes were retained in the nucleus (Hinshaw et al., 1994) resulting in repressed virus titers (Olsen et al., 1996) . Furthermore the recently identified proapoptotic PB1-F2 (Chen et al., 2001) is only expressed in later phases of replication consistent with a later step in the virus life cycle that requires caspase activity (Wurzer et al., 2003) . The observation of a caspase requirement for RNP-nuclear export was quite puzzling since this export process was shown before to be mediated by the active cellular export machinery involving the viral nuclear export protein (NS2/NEP) (Neumann et al., 2000; O'Neill et al., 1998) and the anti-apoptotic Raf/MEK/ERKcascade . Caspase activation does not support, but rather inhibit the active nuclear export machinery by cleavage of transport proteins. This suggests an alternate strategy by which caspases may regulate RNP-export, e.g. by directly or indirectly increase the diffusion limit of nuclear pores (Faleiro and Lazebnik, 2000) to allow passive diffusion of larger proteins. Such a scenario is supported by the finding that isolated NPs or RNP-complexes, which are nuclear if ectopically expressed, can partially translocate to the cytoplasm upon stimulation with an apoptosis inducer in a caspase-3-dependent manner (Wurzer et al., 2003) . These findings can be merged into a model in which the RNPs are transported via an active export mechanism in intermediate steps of the virus life cycle. Once caspase activity increases in the cells, proteins of the transport machinery get destroyed, however, widening of nuclear pores may allow the viral RNPs to use a second mode of exit from the nucleus (Faleiro and Lazebnik, 2000) . That would be a likely mechanism to further enhance RNP-migration to the cytoplasm in late phase of the viral life cycle and thereby support virus replication. Such a complementary use of both \"active\" (Raf/MEK/ERKdependent) and \"passive\" (caspase-dependent) transport mechanisms is supported by the observation, that at concentrations of MEK-and caspaseinhibitors, which only poorly block influenza virus replication alone, efficiently impaired virus propagation if used in combination (Wurzer et al., 2003) . Thus, while both pathways do not interfere with each other (Wurzer et al., 2003) they appear to synergize to mediate RNP-export via different routes.",

Vaccination is still by far the best prophylactic measure, but new drugs, which attack the virus directly, will further support to combat these foes. Nevertheless the viral tactic to escape direct intervention by resistance is a major drawback of current therapeutic interventions. This (discussed in Luscher-Mattli, 2000) .

After fusion of the viral and the endosomal membrane the viral genome is released into the cytoplasm. The RNPs are transported into the nucleus where replication and transcription of the viral RNA segments occurs. The mRNAs are exported into the cytoplasm and are translated into viral proteins. The viral glycoproteins enter the exocytotic transport pathway to the cell surface.",
