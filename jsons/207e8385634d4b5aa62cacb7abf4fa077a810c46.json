Hypofractionated regimens provide effective palliation in a select group of patients considered for reirradiation 43 o Although chemo-sensitive, germinoma is not chemo-curable and radiotherapy has a major role in local control and cannot be omitted 63,64 (level 2) o In localized germinoma, ventricular irradiation to reduce regional subependymal relapse necessitates 24 Gy at 1.6 Gy per fraction 65 This rapid review and recommendation will serve only as a guide to MDTs and are not meant to replace the important network of national and international paediatric radiotherapy experts that regularly give advice. We wish to highlight the importance of recording outcomes for children who receive radical radiotherapy where there have been modifications in fractionation or timing of treatment due to unexpected shortage of facilities such as during the COVID-19 epidemic so that there can be shared learning in the future.",
