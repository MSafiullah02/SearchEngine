Therefore, risk to patients, physicians and staff, and the community at large, must be balanced with the necessity for urgent care. In some cases, the balance may shift to delayed care being more appropriate for safety and conservation of limited resources.",

The balance during a pandemic should favor the value of maximizing benefits to the population [1] .

At this time, there is no recommendation to alter treatment algorithms to favor enucleation over globe salvage; however, patient survival must be prioritized. Informed consent to include COVID-19 risk is recommended. As the pandemic worsens, it is likely that prioritization of only the most urgent and emergent procedures may be necessary. There is precedent for such prioritization of surgical oncology cases by the American College of Surgeons [2] . In these situations, malignant tumors are prioritized over benign tumors, and the highergrade malignancies expected to more immediately lead to death and/or permanent disability are prioritized over less aggressive malignancies. Lower risk and benign case may be amenable to deferred care via telemedicine. Multidisciplinary discussions for urgent and semiurgent cases may facilitate institutional case allocation by OR committees. In some cases, ophthalmic pathology resources may also be limited. Telepathology may be an option in these circumstances.",

Separately, multiple formal surveys were initiated to gauge current COVIDassociated practice patterns that reflect variations in practice focus and location. Preliminary results from one such study, assessing practice patterns among North American ocular oncologist members of the Collaborative Ocular Oncology Group, have recently been made available online [3] . Strong pre-existing research networks and subspecialty societies have aided ocular oncologists in the rapid conduct of research, an often overlooked but critically important component of the public health response. The results of these studies will assist in the development of any future guidelines for ocular oncology care during a similar public health emergency.",

It is important to note that while retinoblastoma care does not fall into an urgent category due to optimal timing for serial interventions, the continuation of retinoblastoma care including examinations under anesthesia is a critical need and should be prioritized \u2212 Nonurgent cases should be deferred for at least 2-3 months or until improved availability of local and national operating room resources Some surgical cases are believed to carry a higher risk for transmission of SARS-CoV-2 [4, 5] . In ocular oncology, these higher-risk procedures are primarily in the oculoplastics domain and are indicated with an asterisk below. Special precautions, including presurgical COVID-19 testing and use of full PPE, should be considered when performing these surgeries in which aerosolization of virus may be more likely to occur. For these procedures, if COVID testing is positive or unavailable and the case cannot be deferred, full PPE including powered air-purifying respirator is strongly recommended.",
