They were housed under controlled lighting conditions (12 h off and 12 h on) with unlimited access to water and a commercial pelleted diet. Rats were fasted overnight, anesthetized with nembutal (50 mg/kg, IP), and exsanguinated prior to removal of the tongues. Von Ebner's glands were dissected from the tongues with the aid of a dissecting microscope. Care was taken not to include any mucous glands that are located posterior and lateral to von Ebner's glands. For most experiments, the glands of 8 rats were dissected, minced, and pooled in 1.33 ml DMEM, previously gassed with 95% O2, 5% CO2. The glands were gassed after each addition of tissue and gently shaken in a water bath at 37\u00b0C. When the dissection was completed, DMEM was added, and the tissue was randomly divided into eight 50 ml round-bottom, screw-capped, polycarbonate tubes.",

One ml DMEM or 1 ml of a DMEM solution of a receptor antagonist was added to the tubes for preincubation. The tubes were gassed and incubated for 20 min at 37\u00b0C in a water bath shaker at 90 cycles/min. The media were aspirated and discarded and 1 ml of DMEM alone (basal secretion) or DMEM solutions of the agonist, antagonist, or a combination of agonist and antagonist solutions were added to the tissue. The incubation was carried out on duplicate samples with gassing every 15 min. Each experiment included untreated samples (controls), to determine basal secretion. Two 0.l ml aliquots were removed from each sample at 15 and 30 min as indicated, and the volume was immediately replaced with the appropriate solution. These aliquots were stored in cryogenic tubes in liquid nitrogen. At 60 min, the final time interval, all the media were aspirated and stored in 2 cryogenic tubes/sample in liquid nitrogen. The tissue was washed with DMEM, frozen on dry ice, and homogenized with a Polytron (Brinkmann Instruments) for 30 sec in Tyrode's solution (glucose free). A total volume of 4 ml Tyrode's solution was used to homogenize the tissue and rinse the Polytron generator. The homogenates were centrifuged for 15 min at 850 \u00d7 g, and the supernatants were measured and then stored in two cryogenic tubes/sample in liquid nitrogen. Using concentrations of 0.01, 0.1, 1.0, 10.0, and 100 \u03bcM SP, the optimal dose for SP was determined to be 1.0 \u03bcM.

The other data were analyzed using the repeated measures procedure in the SAS Proc GLM statistical software package (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Main effects and interactions were tested using the Geisser-Greenhouse corrected F-values. The nature of the time course differences was examined using the orthogonal polynomial contrast option in PROC GLM 23, 41. Differences were considered statistically significant when p < 0.05.

The percentage secretion evoked by 10 \u03bcM was almost the same as by 1 \u03bcM, and 100 \u03bcM evoked very little secretion.

Although, when combined with SP, a trend was seen towards inhibition of SP-evoked secretion, there were no statistically significant changes in the time courses of SP-evoked secretion of lingual lipase or amylase in the presence of CP-96,345 (p = 0.0587 and 0.0671 for lingual lipase and amylase, respectively). CP-96,345 (1 \u03bcM) alone did not significantly stimulate secretion of either enzyme at this concentration. However, with 10 \u03bcM CP-96,345 (Fig. 7B), there was inhibition of SP-evoked secretion. The percentage reduction in lingual lipase secretion was 79.5 \u00b1 18.0, 84.9 \u00b1 4.8, and 47.0 \u00b1 12.3 at 15, 30, and 60 min, respectively and for amylase the percentage reduction in secretion was 48.3 \u00b1 15.2, 56.3 \u00b1 13.3, and 58.5 \u00b1 10.5 at 15, 30, and 60 min, respectively.

The effects of SP on major salivary glands involved the phosphoinositol pathway mediated by cholinergic stimulation [24]. Cholinergic stimulation is the major effector of protein secretion from von Ebner's gland [12]. Therefore, the cholinergic receptor antagonist, atropine, was used to inhibit any cholinergic responses that could possibly be due to SP. Fig. 8\nshows the effects on secretion of lingual lipase and amylase elicited by SP after preincubation of minced von Ebner's gland tissue with atropine followed by incubation with SP and atropine. Statistical analyses did not demonstrate a significant effect of atropine on the SP-evoked secretion of lingual lipase. There was no significant difference between atropine and atropine + SP on amylase secretion at the individual time points, however, statistical analysis by repeated measured ANOVA revealed an overall effect (sum of 30 and 60 min) of the atropine treatment, p = 0.0298. Thus, there was some evidence of cholinergic mediation of SP-evoked amylase secretion, but not lingual lipase secretion. Two \u03b2-adrenergic receptor antagonists, propranolol (Fig. 9\n) and timolol (Fig. 10\n), having both \u03b2\n1 and \u03b2\n2 activities had no significant effect on SP-evoked secretion, nor did they evoke secretion when incubated alone (data not shown).",

Thus, the SP receptor in von Ebner's gland could be an isoform of the receptor found in other organs and this receptor does not bind the above mentioned SP analogs as strongly as it binds SP. Species specificity of the NK-1 receptor was revealed when CP-96,345 was found to be a more potent inhibitor of the human than the rat NK-1 receptor [16]. A minor change in the structure of the receptor could increase the binding of one class of antagonists while decreasing another [16]. A species difference was also observed in the affinity of the nonpeptide NK-1 antagonist, CP-96,345, between rat and guinea pig brains [35]. In addition, in contrast to the rat, SP had no effects on parotid or submandibular secretion in the mouse, but the responses to carbachol and isoproterenol in the mouse were similar to those in the rat [51]. An example of organ specificity was found between rat submandibular glands and the pancreas [52]. Inhibitory effects of SP on [3H]myoinositol transport were mediated through NK-1 receptors in rat submandibular glands, but not in rat pancreas that also have NK-1 receptors.",

The lack of effect of propranolol or timolol, \u03b2-adrenergic receptor antagonists, on SP-stimulated secretion, indicated that the effects of SP were not mediated by \u03b2-adrenergic receptors. However, although atropine, a cholinergic receptor antagonist, had no statistically significant effect on the SP-stimulated secretion of lingual lipase, it did show an overall effect on SP-stimulated secretion of amylase (Fig. 8). Thus indicating the possibility of a cholinergic response that resulted from SP stimulation of protein secretion that was differential between the two enzymes. Using the same methods, propanolol and atropine were shown to inhibit secretion of both enzymes when the tissue was stimulated by isoproterenol and carbachol, respectively [12].",

            "text": "Another interesting finding was that there was differential secretion of lingual lipase and amylase in both basal and SP-stimulated secretion. During basal secretion more amylase than lingual lipase was secreted in the first 15 min. Significant differences were found between the curvatures of the lingual lipase and amylase secretion time courses (Fig. 2). The slope of the amylase time course decreased after 30 min, whereas the slope of the lingual lipase curve remained the same. If exocytosis was the only pathway of secretion, these slopes should have been identical. Similar differences were also seen when the secretion was stimulated by carbachol [12], isoproterenol [12], and histamine [10]. The only explanation for these findings is that factors other than exocytosis may be involved in basal or stimulated secretion of these enzymes. These factors include unstimulated or constitutive secretion [7], and the maturative secretory pathway. This pathway is postulated to exist between the trans-Golgi network and the mature secretory granule and to provide a continuous delivery of protein to the cell surface [54]. It has been suggested that this pathway accounts for differences observed between the patterns of proteins secreted from the exocrine pancreas of conscious hogs when secretion is blocked by atropine as compared to regulated (cholinergic) secretion [54]. It is possible that the constitutive, maturative, or another as yet unknown pathway that operates in addition to exocytosis is responsible for the differential secretion of lingual lipase and amylase. In a recent review article [25], it was suggested that processes, in addition to exocytosis, for the secretion of digestive enzymes would be important to allow for modulation of the amounts of different enzymes secreted depending upon the content of the food ingested. Whereas, exocytosis allows for the secretion of stored enzymes that have been previously synthesized, other means of secretion could modulate the synthesis and independent, immediate secretion of enzymes needed to digest a meal that required more of a particular enzyme.",
