The majority of cats infected with FCoV successfully eliminate the virus, but are susceptible to re-infection by the same or another strain (Addie et al., 2003). Since cats which have different outcomes are often infected with one strain of FCoV, it is likely that genomic variation between cats also contributes to varied clinical outcome. There is some evidence that susceptibility to development of FIP in the cat has a somatic basis (Foley and Pedersen, 1996) and the apparent susceptibility of cheetahs to FIP has been ascribed to that species having gone through a genetic bottleneck in the past (O'Brien et al., 1987).",

As such, they are intimately involved in an individual's response to antigenic challenge following infection or vaccination. Many of the genes of the FLA are extremely polymorphic leading to individual variation in clinical phenotype.

One FIP case was a clinical case of one of the authors (DDA) at the University of Glasgow Veterinary School and his sibling was also tested. Eight cats were from a household with FIP, but whose FCoV status was not yet known. They are included because they supply data for another breed (Korat). Exon 2 of the FLA\u2013DRB was amplified by PCR and polymorphisms detected either by clonal sequence analysis (Kennedy et al., 2002) or by reference strand mediated conformational analysis (RSCA; Arguello et al., 1998).",
