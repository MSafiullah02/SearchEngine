            "text": "Identifying signature features of the growth kinetics of an outbreak can be useful to design reliable models of disease spread and understand important details of the transmission dynamics of an infectious disease (Chowell et al., 2015). However, ideal data are typically not available; rather there will be an absence of high-resolution epidemiological datasets needed to characterize transmission pathways in key settings, e.g., transmission trees in hospitals, schools, households (Cleaton et al., 2015, Faye et al., 2015). The force of infection in mathematical transmission models is typically estimated using time-series data that describe epidemic growth as a function of time (e.g., (Lipsitch et al., 2003, Chowell et al., 2003, Nishiura et al., 1922, Chowell et al., 2004, Riley and Ferguson, 2006, Dietz, 2009)). In fact, during the 2003 SARS (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) threat, the 2009 A/H1N1 influenza pandemic, and the 2013\u20132015 Ebola epidemic in West Africa, aggregated case series at the national or district level were the primary sources of data available for model calibration (e.g., Riley et al., 2003, Pandey et al., 2014, Ferguson et al., 2006, Halloran et al., 2002). A better understanding of observed epidemic growth patterns across different pathogens and across temporal and social contexts could prove useful to improve our ability to design disease transmission models, including the important task of forecasting the likely final size of the epidemic (morbidity, mortality impact), as well as to assess the effects of control interventions.",

            "text": "Classical compartmental transmission models assume exponential growth during the early phase of a well-mixed population (Anderson and May, 1991). In a recent article (Chowell et al., 2015) we reported that the initial apparently exponential spread of the 2013\u20132015 Ebola epidemic in West Africa was in fact a composition of local asynchronous outbreaks at the district or county level that each displayed sub-exponential growth patterns during at least 3 consecutive disease generations (Chowell et al., 2015). In semi-logarithmic scale, exponential growth is evident if a straight line fits well several consecutive disease generations of the epidemic curve, whereas a strong downward curvature in semi-logarithmic scale is indicative of sub-exponential growth. Here, we introduce a generalized model with a \u201cdeceleration\u201d parameter that modulates growth and helps quantify departure from exponential theory, allowing for behaviors ranging from constant to exponentially-growing incidences (Tolle, 2003). Our simple quantitative framework is useful for public health decision-making as it provides a time-varying assessment of growth rates and informs the likely \u201csignature feature\u201d of the threat as well as the type and intensity of interventions required for effective mitigation. We illustrate our method using a diverse set of historic and contemporary outbreaks of acute viral and bacterial pathogens, including the recent West African Ebola virus epidemic, focusing on local outbreaks. Our results underscore the high sensitivity of epidemic size to small variations in the \u201cdeceleration\u201d parameter.",

            "text": "The growth pattern of infectious disease outbreaks has been extensively studied using models that assume exponential growth dynamics in the absence of control interventions (e.g., classical compartmental models (Anderson and May, 1991, Kermack and McKendrick, 1937)). Hence, the cumulative number of cases, C(t), grows according to the equation: Ct=C0ert where, r is the growth rate per unit of time, t denotes time, and C(0) is the number of cases at the start of the outbreak. Here the growth rate \u201cr\u201d is related to R\n0 as derived from classic SIR-type compartmental transmission models, e.g., for the simple SIR (susceptible-infected-removed) model, R\n0\n = 1 + \nr/\u03b3 where, 1/\u03b3 is the mean infectious period (Anderson and May, 1991). However, slower-than-exponential epidemic growth is expected in settings that involve highly constrained population contact structures with infectious diseases that spread via close contacts (e.g., sexually-transmitted infectious diseases, smallpox, and Ebola) (Chowell et al., 2015). To relax the assumption of exponential growth, we use a simple generalized model (Tolle, 2003) from the field of demography (e.g., Reppell et al., 2014), following:dCtdt=C\u2032t=rCtpwhere, C\u2032(t) describes the incidence curve over time t, the solution C(t) describes the cumulative number of cases at time t, r is a positive parameter denoting the growth rate (1/time), and p\n \u2208 [0, 1] is a \u201cdeceleration of growth\u201d parameter. If p\n = 0, this equation describes constant incidence over time and the cumulative number of cases grows linearly while p\n = 1 models exponential growth dynamics (i.e., Malthus equation). Intermediate values of p between 0 and 1 describe sub-exponential (e.g., polynomial) growth patterns. For example, if p\n = 1/2 incidence grows linearly while the cumulative number of cases follows a quadratic polynomial. If p\n = 2/3 incidence grows quadratically while the cumulative number of cases fits a cubic polynomial. For sub-exponential growth (i.e., 0 < \np\n < 1) the solution of this equation is given by the following polynomial of degree m (Tolle, 2003):Ct=rmt+Amwhere, m is a positive integer, and the \u201cdeceleration of growth\u201d parameter is given by p\n = 1 \u2212 1/m. (Tolle, 2003) A is a constant that depends on the initial condition, C(0). Specifically, A=C0m. Furthermore, for sub-exponential growth dynamics, the relative growth rate, [dC(t)/dt]/C(t) \u221d \nm/t, decreases inversely with time while the doubling time T\nd\n \u221d \nt(ln 2)/m increases proportionally with time (Fig. 1\n) (Chowell et al., 2015). This differs from the constant doubling time that characterizes exponential growth. Here, we do not consider faster than exponential growth (i.e., super-exponential growth), for which p exceeds 1.0 (Tolle, 2003).",

Our approach provides a simple 2-parameter quantitative framework to assess epidemic growth patterns over time. This framework could also be useful to assess shifts in epidemic growth patterns resulting from mitigation during an outbreak, as a consequence of population behavior changes or public health control interventions that affect transmission (e.g., increased bed capacity, school closings). We illustrate the approach through simulations and applications to various empirical infectious disease datasets representing directly and sexually transmitted viral pathogens, including Ebola, pandemic influenza, smallpox, plague, measles, foot-and-mouth disease, and HIV/AIDS. Our findings indicate significant variability in epidemic growth patterns across pathogens and geographic settings (Table 1) and demonstrate high sensitivity of epidemic size estimates to small variations in the \u201cdeceleration\u201d parameter of our generalized-growth model.",

Other factors shaping sub-exponential growth patterns could include substantial heterogeneity in susceptibility and infectivity in the underlying population that further distorts the contact network structure relevant to disease spread.

It would be interesting to conduct a systematic analysis of growth patterns of pandemic and seasonal influenza epidemics in particular areas of the world with reliable and space- and time-resolved incidence datasets. We hypothesize that estimates of p would be lower for seasonal influenza epidemics and/or that rapid shifts in this parameter occur during seasonal influenza epidemics, reflecting the combined and complex benefits of underlying immunity, school activity patterns, and other behavioral changes in response to influenza epidemics (Fenichel et al., 2011).",

Yet, further analysis of historical smallpox datasets is warranted to better understand the dynamics of this infectious disease of the past.

While these results should be important to guide the design of mathematical models of Ebola transmission dynamics and control, a better understanding of the factors that shaped Ebola epidemic growth patterns including spontaneous behavior changes and increased healthcare infrastructure (Kucharski et al., 2015) are needed to guide the development of mechanistic transmission models that would allow the evaluation of specific control policies.

            "text": "It is common practice to rely on epidemic models largely based on homogenous mixing assumptions, whereby the initial growth phase follows an exponential growth during several generations of the disease (e.g., (Anderson and May, 1991, Chowell et al., 2007, Wallinga and Lipsitch, 2007, Roberts and Heesterbeek, 2007)). Estimates of the basic reproduction number R\n0, a key quantity for disease control, can be obtained by fitting these models to time-series of case reports during the early epidemic ascending phase (Wallinga and Lipsitch, 2007) (Roberts and Heesterbeek, 2007, Diekmann and Heesterbeek, 2000). Our findings indicate the assumption of exponential growth may be inappropriate, and sub-exponential growth patterns should be considered in parameterization of mathematical transmission models. In fact, Liu et al. (1987) incorporated phenomenological parameters in the bilinear incidence rates of the mechanistic SIR model, as a way to expand the range of plausible dynamical epidemic behaviors. Similarly, Finkenst\u00e4dt (2000) developed the well-known TSIR modeling framework that includes a phenomenological parameter to capture non-homogeneous mixing in the analysis of infectious disease time-series data (Grenfell et al., 2001, Finkenst\u00e4dt, 2000). A necessary condition for validating a transmission model is that the model is able to reproduce growth patterns that are consistent with observed epidemiological outbreak data (Burt and Chowell, 2008); and hence, knowledge about the extent of exponential growth in a given epidemic is useful to guide the design of transmission models. Further, model refinements relating to sub-exponential growth dynamics may be particularly important if these models are used for forecasting purposes, whether it relates to the epidemic trajectory or final epidemic size. Our findings indicate that careful consideration to the range of epidemic growth profiles arising from infectious disease transmission in specific contact structures is needed during the model development phase. For instance, previous modeling efforts have incorporated mechanisms that indirectly support slower epidemic growth patterns in the context of several infectious diseases including HIV/AIDS (Colgate et al., 1989), Ebola (Kiskowski and Chowell, 2015, Kiskowski, 2014, Merler et al., 2015), foot-and-mouth disease(Chowell et al., 2006b, Ferguson et al., 2001, Keeling et al., 2003), and smallpox (Riley and Ferguson, 2006, Halloran et al., 2002, Eubank et al., 2004).",

For instance, it could be useful to systematically characterize spatial heterogeneity in different contact networks. Moreover, as model complexity grows from the convolution of detailed epidemiological and large-scale contact networks (e.g., Halloran et al., 2002, Eubank et al., 2004, Germann et al., 2006, Ferguson et al., 2005), the resulting collective epidemic dynamics are increasingly difficult to characterize as a function of individual model components alone. Hence, the range of epidemic growth profiles generated by exploring a realistic area of the disease parameters space could be used to gauge the plausibility of the model. For example, a transmission model designed to study an HIV/AIDS or Ebola epidemics and unable to reproduce sub-exponential growth dynamics would automatically fail an initial validation phase, even before application to observed epidemic data.",

For instance, the logistic growth model provides a statistical description of a single-outbreak trajectory, inspired from population biology. This model relies on two parameters and follows the equation C\u2032(t) = \nr\n \nC(t) [1 \u2212 \nC(t)/K] where, C\u2032(t) describes case incidence over time, \u201cr\u201d is the intrinsic growth rate (per unit of time), and K is the expected final epidemic size (total no. of cases). This model assumes an initial exponential growth phase that saturates as the number of cases accumulate, a pattern that implicitly captures a gradual decrease in the at-risk susceptible population owing to behavior changes (e.g., campaigns to educate the population on how to avoid contracting the disease) and/or control interventions (e.g., increasing rate of diagnosis and isolation of infectious individuals). However, epidemic models that assume initial exponential growth dynamics are incompatible for forecasting outbreaks characterized by sub-exponential growth dynamics particularly when the \u201cdeceleration of growth\u201d parameter is substantially lower than 1.0.",

We hypothesize that sub-exponential growth may result from highly constrained population contact structures, population immunity, or the early onset of behavior changes or control interventions.
