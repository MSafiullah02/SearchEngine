Particularly, the emergence of a large number of pan-drug resistant strains poses great difficulties for treatment of pediatric patients [2]. The intensive care unit has become a high-risk area for hospital-acquired infections and drug-resistant strains regarding its large number of special susceptible populations and its special diagnosis and treatment environment, especially in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) [3]. PICU patients are particularly susceptible to nosocomial infections, the potential reasons may include that the use of invasive devices and procedures in this critically ill patient group, and the children\u2019s immune function is relatively incompletely developed [4]. Although a serious infection may prompt the entry to PICU, MDRI may be a post-hospital complication, potentially life threatening for children [5]. Many previous studies [6\u20138] have indicated that the incidence of nosocomial infections caused by antibiotic-resistant organisms is increasing. The prevalence of hospital-acquired or nosocomial infections in pediatric patients ranges from 10 to 25% in PICU [9, 10]. Therefore, the control of infection in PICU is very important.",

It\u2019s been reported [12] that Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), Carbapenem-based antibacterial drug Acinetobacter baumannii (CR-AB) are the three commonly-seen multi-drug resistant bacteria. In PICU, considering that the low immunity, serious condition, long hospitalization, mechanical ventilation, invasive examination and other factors related to the treatment of children, the incidence of MDRIs increases significantly, posing a great threat to children [4, 13].",

Previous studies [17\u201319] have reported that the patients with MDRI were hospitalized and treated in the ICU for considerably longer stay and had lower survival rates compared to other patient groups. Identifying risk factors for infection development caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria can help health care providers prevent nosocomial infections. This becomes even more important if we consider the slow drug development of new effective anti-bacteria and the rising prevalence of MDRI, especially in the PICU. The results of this present study have revealed that coma, parenteral nutrition, 2 or more antibiotics use and the duration of mechanical ventilation > 5 d are independent risk factors associated with MDRIs in PICU.

There are many types of diseases in the ICU, the coma children in PICU are usually seriously ill and the treatment periods are longer [2, 21]. The extension of the ICU stay increases the use of antibiotics, invasive operation and cross-infection between patients. Besides, the body\u2019s own pathogens may shift to other tissues and organs, leading to endogenous infections [22]. As the hospitalization period is extended, the patient\u2019s medical expenses will also increase, and the human-borne pathogens can invade the body, causing exogenous infections, thus the risk of MDRI can increase [23]. Usually, the beds in the ICU are very few, and the increase of MDRI makes the medical resources not properly configured. Previous studies [24, 25] have concluded that the hospitalization time of patient needs to be strictly controlled, which is one of the effective measures to prevent MDRI.",

The establishment of an artificial airway in an ICU patient results in the disappearance of the natural barrier of the upper respiratory tract and direct communication of the lower respiratory tract with the outside air. Various invasive medical procedures potentially increase the risk of infection in the lower respiratory tract [28]. The establishment of the artificial airway opens the respiratory pathway for the patient, but long-term mechanical ventilation and open-ended invasive procedures such as suction and fiberoptic bronchoscopy increase the incidence of VAP [29]. Additionally, resistant bacteria can easily enter the bloodstream through the damaged blood gas barrier, causing blood sepsis [30]. Besides, it is often the case that the maintenance and care of the ventilator tube is not standardized, or the equipment is not properly disinfected, which provides a shortcut for the invasion of the drug-resistant bacteria, which is one of the important reasons for the MDRI in ICU [31, 32]. In clinical setting, special attention should be paid to the patient in comatose state and with mechanical ventilation length > 5 days. Patients who have been in bed for a long time are prone to pneumonia.",

When the antibiotic used by the patient reaches or is about to reach the sublethal dose, the selective pressure of the antibiotic can force the change of body\u2019s behavior, physiology and biochemistry [36]. The gene and protein expression of the resistant bacteria will change, the protective defense and immunity of the body will gradually weaken, and the risk of MDRI elevates [37]. China is a large country with massive use of antibiotics, and the frequency of antibiotics use is very high [38, 39]. It\u2019s been reported [40, 41] that almost 80% hospitalized patients in China have been prescribed antibacterial drugs, and the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics is 28% higher than the average antibiotics use globally. There is a close correlation between the amount of antibiotics used and bacterial resistance. ICU has higher pathogen composition ratio and bacterial resistance [34], thus it\u2019s necessary to fully grasp the basic information of bacterial epidemiology in ICU, and control the resistance of various drug-resistant bacteria with different antibiotics, to provide basis for MDRI treatment and strategies.",

Firstly, it should be acknowledged that, due to the innate limitations of retrospective studies, a significant proportion of the children had more than one incidence of infection, but only one incidence per patient was analyzed. Secondly, there is ample room for improvement in the explanation of the rationale to include cases, and specially, for the justification of choosing a case: control ratio of 1:1, when the customary ratio is to have at least 2 controls for each case. The relatively limited number of cases included in this present analysis may not be powered enough to detect the potential risk factors for MDRIs, future studies with larger sample and broader areas are needed to identify the MDRIs risks. Despite these shortcomings in this study, the results of this study may still lend some inspiration for clinical health workers, as this is the first analysis of the risk factors for the development MDRI in PICU.",
