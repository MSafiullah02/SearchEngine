Phosphate buffered saline (10 mM sodium phosphate pH 6.0, 50 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA) was initially dropped on the sensor. There is no net current change until the target protein concentration of 0.003 nM of the protein was added. A clear current change was observed as the system reached a steady state. Real-time current monitoring spanned the range of protein concentrations from 0.003 nM to 3000 nM, and showed saturation as the concentration of N protein larger than 300 nM. The current drop for different protein concentration was due to the binding between the protein and the dsDNA on the gate region of the transistor, resulting in the change of the surface potential on the gate region, leading to the drain current drop. The protein concentration in Fig. 2 was an accumulated concentration. Therefore, the current drop for each target protein concentration was determined by the difference of the current levels between the steady state of the target concentration and the steady state of the buffer solution. The red lines in Fig. 2 represent the average current level for each steady state. Fig. 3\nshows the current changes at different SARS-N protein-CTD concentrations from the sensors. The red line and the black line represent the current changes from the HEMT with and without DNA immobilized, respectively.

(5) using the dissociation constant extracted from Fig. 4(a) and the \u0394I/\u0394I\nmax obtained from the experimental results shown as dots versus the ligand concentration in log scale. It is obvious that the curve of the surface coverage ratio does not match well with those experimental dots. From Eq. (5), it is shown that the surface coverage ratio actually depends on the ratio of dissociation constant to the concentration of ligand, that is K\nD/[L]. When K\nD equals 10 folds or 10% of [L], the surface coverage ratio goes to around 9.09% and 90.91%, respectively. Beyond 90.91% or below 9.09% of the surface coverage ratio, increasing or decreasing the concentration of antigen does not change the surface coverage ratio much. Therefore, we conclude that for a one-binding-site model, the most significant change of the surface coverage ratio is within the range of the ligand concentration between one order higher and one order lower than the value of the dissociation constant. This was also shown by experimental data in literature [29]. Thus, ideally once the dissociation constant is determined, the highest sensitivity for the sensor is only within this two-order range of ligand concentration. On the other hand, for any experimental result, the surface coverage ratio between 9.09% and 90.91% should only cover two orders of ligand concentration for an ideal one-binding-site model. However, in Fig. 4(b), it is significant that between 9.09% and 90.91% of the surface coverage, the experimental data points cover more than 3 orders of the ligand concentration. Therefore, it is not possible to fit these experimental points well into the surface coverage ratio with the one-binding-site model. The wide range of the ligand concentration within that coverage ratio (9.09\u201390.91%) may be resulted from multiple binding sites of the receptor. Compared with Fig. 4(a), Fig. 4(b) is clearly more sensitive to see whether the one-binding-site model can really fit into the experimental data. Thus, the surface coverage ratio versus the ligand concentration will be used for finding out the number of binding sites and the associated dissociation constants. Here a two-binding-site model is proposed as the following.",

The experimental data points nicely fit into the two-binding-site model. Two dissociation constants, (K\nD1\n = 0.0955 nM, K\nD2\n = 51.23 nM, c\n1\n = 0.7506, and c\n2\n = 0.2494) were extracted from the two-binding-site model. The correlation coefficient r\n2 is 0.988. This result suggests that there are at least two SARS-N protein-CTD binding on the dsDNA. It was not reported the dissociation constants between the dsDNA and the SARS-N protein-CTD. However, it was observed in literature [5] that both RNA and dsDNA have very strong binding with the SARS-N protein-CTD, while the ssDNA has weaker binding compared with RNA and the dsDNA. RNA aptamer was reported to have a dissociation constant as 0.8 nM when binding to the SARS-N protein-CTD [31]. There is only single dissociation constant obtained due to the extraction of the dissociation constant simply from a one-binding-site system. The value of the dissociation constant for RNA from the literature [31] is just between our K\nD1 and K\nD2. Since both dsDNA and RNA have strong binding affinity with the SARS-N protein-CTD, we believe that the values of our dissociation constants are in a reasonable range. In another literature, ssDNA aptamer was reported to have dissociation constant as 4.9 nM when binding to the SARS-N protein-CTD [32]. Although the sequence of the RNA aptamer and the ssDNA aptamer is different from ours, the values of the reported dissociation constants are consistent with our results. Our results are obtained based on dealing with the whole system with full spectrum of the protein concentration.",

To investigate that possibility, three-binding-site model was used to fit the experimental data, and it looks like the fitting is also very nice, as shown in Appendix A, Appendix A. However, we can easily find that for the three dissociation constants extracted from the three-binding-site model, the K\nD2 and the K\nD3 are very close, and their values are almost the same as the K\nD2 extracted from the two-binding-site model. Needless to say, the K\nD1 extracted from the three-binding-site model is almost the same as the K\nD1 extracted from the two-binding-site model. We therefore can conclude that if two-binding-site model can be well fitted with the experimental data, it is not necessary to try with higher number of binding-site model. The methodology that we adopt in the analysis of the dissociation constants and the number of binding sites in this research mainly relies on the full range of the protein concentration, from low surface coverage to full saturation, which allows us to see the whole response for full range of the protein concentration. This is a very important key to investigate the complete information about the affinity between the protein and the dsDNA. If the sensor was only tested with a small range of the protein concentration, but not the full range until saturation, then the information about the number of binding sites and the dissociation constants extracted from the curve-fitting technique may be misled into wrong results and conclusion. We found that for some researches the range of the ligand concentration is sometimes ignored. To investigate the full range of the ligand concentration, the model that utilizes the surface coverage ratio is very successful to handle such many orders of magnitude of the ligand concentration. Therefore, the binding-site model using the surface coverage ratio together with the HEMTs becomes a simple and useful tool for the analysis of the binding affinity between the SARS-N-protein and dsDNA.",
