            "text": "Despite improvements in supportive treatment for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), mortality among patients with sepsis-associated ARDS remains high [1]. The pathogenesis of this syndrome is characterized by overwhelming inflammation that results in alveolar damage, accompanied by the exudation of protein-rich pulmonary-edema fluid in the alveolar space, which leads to respiratory failure [2]. During the course of this inflammation, which results in cellular damage and death, the development of both pulmonary and extra-pulmonary organ failure is promoted. Consequently, therapies that attenuate inflammation may have positive impacts on the clinical course and outcome of patients with ARDS [3]. Inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase, known as statins, are frequently prescribed for treatment of hypercholesterolemia worldwide. However, statins also have immunosuppressive properties and can attenuate inflammation. In ARDS murine models, statins have been shown to prevent disease development [4, 5]. Simvastatin, which is among the most prescribed statins worldwide, has been shown to reduce pulmonary and systemic inflammatory responses in a human model of ARDS induced by lipopolysaccharide inhalation [6]. Whereas several studies have suggested that patients with severe inflammatory conditions, such as sepsis or ARDS, who receive statins have improved clinical outcomes [4, 6\u201310], other studies examining the impacts of statin therapy on the clinical outcomes of these patients have failed to show any beneficial effects [11\u201313]. These contradictory results regarding the beneficial impacts of statin therapy on ARDS patients might be due to the fact that the previous studies evaluated heterogenic ARDS patient groups without considering disease severity as a potential determinant of therapeutic responsiveness.",

Written informed consent was obtained from all patients or their legal representatives. Adult Caucasian patients admitted to the surgical intensive care units (ICUs) of the University Medical Center of Goettingen between April 2012 and September 2014 were evaluated daily according to the American College of Chest Physicians/Society of Critical Care Medicine (ACCP/SCCM) criteria for sepsis [15, 16]. Patients with sepsis were screened daily according to the Berlin definition of ARDS to identify those with sepsis-associated ARDS [14\u201316]. The patient exclusion criteria were as follows: those who i) were younger than 18 years of age; ii) were pregnant or nursing an infant; iii) were receiving immunosuppressive therapy; iv) had a documented myocardial infarction within the previous 6 weeks; v) had New York Heart Association functional class IV chronic heart failure; vi) were infected with human immunodeficiency virus; vii) had a do not resuscitate or do not treat order; viii) were not expected to survive the next 28 days because of an uncorrectable medical condition (e.g., poorly controlled neoplasm); ix) were in a chronic vegetative state with pronounced neurological impairment; x) were currently participating in any clinical trial (of a drug or device); xi) could not be fully evaluated during the study period; and xii) were a study-site employee or the family member of a study-site employee. Because interracial genetic differences may affect the clinical courses of infectious diseases, we exclusively recruited Caucasians for this observational study. Caucasians also comprise the greatest proportion of patients admitted to our surgical ICUs. According to pharmacogenetic studies, the frequency of polymorphisms in statin transporter genes vary markedly between populations and can have profound effects on statin pharmacokinetics [17, 18]. In particular, a common genetic variant of organic anion-transporting polypeptide 1B1 with a diverse distribution among populations reduces the hepatic uptake of many statins, increasing the risks of statin-induced myopathy and adverse events [18, 19].",

A tidal volume of 6 cc/kg predicted body weight or lower is used to maintain an inspiratory plateau pressure of <30 cm of water [20]. Patients with more severe hypoxemia exhibit a high positive end-expiratory pressure [21]. Patients with refractory hypoxemia are placed in the prone position to improve oxygenation [22, 23]. Additionally, rescue oxygenation is performed at our center using standardized extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) therapy for patients with profound refractory hypoxemia [24]. ARDS patients also receive conservative intravenous fluid management to reduce pulmonary microvascular pressure and the likelihood of developing pulmonary edema [25].",

Among all of the patients, 27 % were pretreated with statins, and statin therapy was continued over the observation period in this patient group. Most of the patients in the statin group were pretreated with simvastatin (87.1 %, Table 1), which was given at the same dose after admission. The patients who were pretreated with one of the other statins were switched to simvastatin (the standard statin in our ICUs) at an equivalent dose. Patients who were fed via a tube were still given statins. The patients underwent statin therapy because of associated comorbid conditions. The rate of statin therapy did not differ significantly among the three ARDS subgroups. Simvastatin (20 or 40 mg) was the most frequently used statin (87.1 %; Table 1). The ages of the patients ranged from 19 to 92 years (median, 63 years; Table 1). The ARDS patients on statin therapy were significantly older than those who were not on this therapy (70 \u00b1 11 and 60 \u00b1 16, respectively; P <0.001; Table 1). No differences were recorded in gender or BMI between the two groups (Table 1). The proportion of patients with septic shock was significantly higher among the patients without statin therapy compared with those receiving this therapy (68 % and 52 %, respectively; P = 0.0035). At baseline, the patients without statin therapy had significantly higher SOFA scores compared with those receiving therapy (9.9 \u00b1 3.8 and 8.9 \u00b1 3.4, respectively; P = 0.0158). No differences were found in APACHE II scores with respect to statin therapy at baseline (Table 1).",

According to Thille et al. [28], patients with severe ARDS comprise a homogeneous group characterized by a high proportion of diffuse alveolar damage compared with those with mild or moderate ARDS. Diffuse alveolar damage is accompanied by a severe inflammatory state; therefore, patients with severe ARDS are more likely to benefit from the anti-inflammatory, pleiotropic effects of statin therapy. Our results confirm previous reports of the beneficial effects of statin therapy continuation on the survival of patients with sepsis [29, 30]. In a recent multicenter prospective study that included patients with severe sepsis, Kruger et al.

Current treatment modalities focus on symptomatic treatments, including mechanical ventilation and organ support. This evidence of a beneficial impact of statin continuation on severe ARDS patients suggests that statin therapy should be continued for all critically ill patients who are at high risk of developing sepsis or infection, i.e., those undergoing surgical procedures with a high infection risk. Furthermore, according to our investigation, preventive statin treatment in patients with a high predisposition to sepsis or sepsis-associated ARDS may be of potential therapeutic significance and should be addressed in future studies. Analogous to evidence demonstrated by previous cardiovascular studies that a statin treatment duration of 8 to 12 weeks is needed to achieve pleotropic effects [31\u201333], we believe that patients with sepsis-associated ARDS must be pretreated with statins for 8 to 12 weeks to achieve beneficial effects in this patient group.",

The observed lower cardiovascular scores might have been due to anti-inflammatory effects of the statin therapy, which inhibited the release of inflammatory mediators and resulted in less vasodilatation in the patients in this group [5]. In accordance with the lower cardiovascular SOFA scores, severe sepsis-associated ARDS patients also had significantly more vasopressor-free days compared with those who were not on statin therapy (Table 4). Similarly, the observed lower hepatic SOFA scores can be explained by the fact that statin therapy has a beneficial effect on liver function [5]. As shown by Arnaud et al.

A future randomized controlled (RCT) study would be much more suitable, although this study does provide impetus for potential studies to examine the use of statins in severe ARDS. This type of RCT would be very difficult to conduct because the duration of statin pretreatment and the dose required to achieve beneficial effects on the clinical course for patients with severe sepsis-associated ARDS are unknown. A further potential limitation is that plasma statin levels were not measured. Therefore, we cannot rule out the fact that statin levels were not within the therapeutic range. However, according to previous investigations, high plasma levels of statins are achieved (especially in critically ill patients in the ICU) even after the administration of a single dose [8, 35]. Moreover, the plasma level of statins required to induce anti-inflammatory effects is not known. Furthermore, because no previous investigations have addressed the effects of statin therapy on ARDS according to disease severity, we were unable to conduct power calculations at the beginning of the study to estimate a sample size with sufficient power. However, ad hoc power analysis yielded a power of 0.87, according to our observation of 11.5 % mortality in the severe ARDS patients on statin therapy compared with 37.5 % mortality in those who were not on this therapy. Therefore, our investigated cohort of 404 patients with sepsis-associated ARDS was sufficient to address our hypotheses.",
