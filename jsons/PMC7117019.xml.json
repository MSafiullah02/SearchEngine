They also undermine food security by making land unavailable for growing food and herding livestock (Andersson, Palha da Sousa, & Paredes, 1995). Within mine-affected communities, the dangers are faced especially by the poorest people, who have to roam widely in search of water, fuel, and forest foods, increasing the danger of entering unmarked minefields (Roberts & Williams, 1995). The world has responded to the risks posed by landmines and UXO by spending over US$1.7 billion on mine clearance since 1992. The overall trend is for spending to rise, with US$300 million spent on mine clearance in 2002 (ICBL, 2002).",

In Mozambique, the benefits would be worth only 10% of the costs (Elliot & Harris, 2001). Similarly, Mitchell (2004) suggests that landmines are not serious impediments to economic development in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and argues that general promotion of demining as a development action is unwarranted. An exception to these negative results is the study by Harris (2002) of mine clearance in Afghanistan in which a positive net present value is obtained.

While discounting costs substantially reduces the size of the negative NPV, the estimated benefits are still only 5% of costs. Paterson also notes that the study by Harris, and by implication the other studies cited above, fail to note that landmine programs involve targeted clearance operations rather than an \u201caverage\u201d clearance task so that mine fields with the greatest benefits are likely to be cleared first. For example, Paterson suggests that in Cambodia the clearance of landmines that prevent the use of existing infrastructure or allow new development projects such as access roads, water systems, and irrigation works are likely to yield significant economic returns. As a result, the true economic benefits of real landmine programs are seriously underestimated. A recent cost\u2013benefit study undertaken by Gildestad (2005) shows positive benefit\u2013cost ratios for clearing irrigation systems, water supplies, roads and bridges, school premises, health stations, and historical sites in Cambodia, while costs do not generally cover benefits for the clearance of agricultural lands. Applying these results to the overall Cambodian clearance program in 2004 Gildestad finds that benefits were 38% higher than costs.\n1\n",

These studies value injuries and premature death according to the present value of lost earnings (or lost GDP).\n2 This foregone earnings approach is no longer popular in developed countries because it ignores risk aversion and underestimates the value of life (Rosen, 1988). Instead, developed countries now use estimates of the value of statistical life (VSL). This VSL is calculated either from reports by survey respondents of how much they would be willing to pay to avoid risks (or how much they would need to be paid to accept risks) or from market-based, revealed preference studies. The theoretical superiority of VSL measures is recognized in the landmine clearance literature (e.g., Harris, 2000) but because no estimates exist for countries with landmine problems, imperfect foregone earnings methods are used. Perhaps as a result, saved lives and disabilities are a small part of the calculated benefit of landmine clearance, whereas the value of statistical life is easily the largest benefit of environmental, health, and safety rules in developed countries (Shogren & Stamland, 2002).",

Most landmines are located in poor countries, but most landmine clearance is paid for by rich country donors and NGOs. Elliot and Harris (2001) suggest that donors may value the lives saved by clearing mines using standards from their own (rich) countries. Over-valuing saved lives could explain why landmine clearance standards are so strict, requiring 100% removal of mines and UXO (UNMAS, 2003). This standard favors expensive manual clearance because existing machines cannot find every single mine. In contrast, it is socially efficient to reduce the risk from landmines only to the point where the marginal cost per life saved is the same as for other risk reducing activities (Viscusi, 2000).",

The contingent-valuation (CV) method is used to estimate the VSL for a rural population in Northeast Thailand. Currently, landmine and UXO accidents cause about 40 deaths and 130 injuries per year in Thailand. Mines and UXO are present in 530 communities, containing just over 500 000 people. The incidence rate of landmine fatalities and injuries is 34 per 100 000 in the affected communities and 0.28 per 100 000 when calculated for the whole country (SAC, 2003). Landmines are likely to pose a continuing risk for many years. In the three years since mine action units were established, the Thai army has cleared less than 1% of the 2 560 km2 of mine-contaminated land.",

Therefore, to illustrate the implications of the VSL estimates for cost\u2013benefit studies of mine clearance, we reconsider the study by Gildestad (2005) of mine clearance in neighboring Cambodia. The use of more plausible VSL measures that would follow from our study increases the importance of human benefits relative to development benefits in assessing targeted clearance. These results also show that the value of VSL used is decisive in making judgements about the economic value of clearing agricultural land and in setting clearance priorities. In addition to adding to the literature on the costs and benefits of landmine clearance, our study is also relevant to the broader literature on the value of risk reduction. A key requirement for any rational risk policy is knowledge of the value to place on lives saved by interventions that aim to reduce risk. In contrast to the developed countries, almost nothing is known about the value of statistical life in developing countries. A recent survey of 70 VSL estimates finds only four that come from countries that might once have been considered as developing (Taiwan and South Korea) and none from currently developing countries (Miller, 2000).",

This study clearly shows that the values of statistical life obtained using contingent valuation or revealed preference methods are not close to estimates based on the present value of lifetime income foregone.

Khon Kaen is adjacent to landmine-affected areas but is not mined. This may help the contingent valuation method because participants are asked to make comparisons between hypothetical areas with different incomes and levels of risk. These risk comparisons may be less influenced by the perceptions of actual accident risk than they would be in communities directly affected by landmines. The general methodology chosen for the survey was based on that used by Viscusi, Magat, and Huber (1991) in studying chronic bronchitis and auto fatality risk in the US. Perreira and Sloan (2002) have also used this approach in considering disability and death risks in the US. The survey design and its application were adapted to enable this approach to be applied in low income rural communities, and to address the issues of concern in this study.",

For the risk\u2013money tradeoffs the areas differed by the risk of death and cash income. For the risk\u2013risk tradeoffs the areas differed by the risk of injury and the risk of death. Thus, in determining risk\u2013money tradeoffs the respondents were not directly asked about their willingness to pay for a reduction in risk, or the amount required to accept an increase in risk. This approach makes it possible to avoid issues associated with who will or should pay for landmine clearance, how payments will be made, and exactly what the payments are for. These types of issues would be important for the low income communities involved in this survey. While respondents were not directly asked for their willingness to pay to reduce risk or willingness to accept risk, the way in which the alternatives were presented could be interpreted in these terms since risk increases may be valued differently from risk decreases (Viscusi et al., 1991). To provide a test of the sensitivity of results to the way in which the alternatives are presented two questionnaires were used in this study, one that could be interpreted in \u201cwillingness to pay\u201d terms and one with a \u201cwillingness to accept\u201d focus.",

In this study risks were not presented in terms of annual probabilities of death or injury, but in terms of the frequency of occurrence of an event, for example, a change in the risk of death from 4 per year in a population of 10 000 to 2 per year.\n6 In an attempt to further simplify the statement of risk, respondents were asked to consider 10 villages each with a 1 000 inhabitants and a particular number of deaths or injuries across the villages each year.

Miller (2000) predicts a VSL of US$450 000 for Thailand (in 2003 prices), based on a regression of previous VSL studies in other countries.

Perreira and Sloan (2002) use randomly selected initial values to avoid this bias.

In applying our VSL estimates we have ignored possible differences between adult and child VSL measures. VSLs can also be expected to change over time as the real incomes increase. We apply the growth assumptions used by Gildestad and the three elasticities above to revise the VSL estimates for lives saved in the future. The mean injury risk\u2013death risk tradeoff of 5.1 is used to estimate of the value of reductions in amputations. Following Gildestad, we assume that the value of reductions in other injuries is 57% of the value of an amputation saved.",

For VSL measures based on an income elasticity of 0.5 clearing agricultural land in four of the nine provinces would be economic. Thus, for agricultural land the VSL measure used is likely to be decisive in making judgments about the economic value of clearance and in setting clearance priorities.",
