A recent analysis shows that, following the national lockdown of March 9th, the mobility fluxes have decreased by 50% or more, everywhere in the country [13] . In this report, To this purpose, we use mobile phone data to compute the movements of people between Italian provinces, and we analyze the incoming, outcoming and internal mobility flows before and during the national lockdown (March 9th, 2020) and after the closure of non-necessary productive and economic activities (March 23th, 2020). The population flow across provinces and municipalities enable for the modeling of a risk index tailored for the mobility of each municipality or province. Such an index would be a useful indicator to drive counter-measures in reaction to a sudden reactivation of the epidemics.",

Multiple antennas are usually mounted on the same tower, each covering a different direction. The position of the tower (expressed as latitude and longitude) and the direction of the antenna allow inferring the extension of the corresponding phone cell. The position of caller and callee is approximated by the corresponding antenna serving the call, whose extension is relatively small in urban contexts (in the order of 100m x 100m) and much larger in rural areas (in the order of 1km x 1km or more).",

The presence of two consecutive points of a user in different municipalities indicates a movement, which is counted as a trip if the user stays in the destination municipality for at least one hour, and discarded otherwise. For a better matching with public COVID-19 data, we aggregated the municipality-to-municipality ODs into province-to-province ODs, in which each node represents an Italian province. The trips between municipalities of the same province have been aggregated into a self-loop, which indicates the province's internal mobility. As they are calculated by the operator, we store the daily municipality-to-municipality OD matrices and the daily province-to-province ones into a relational DBMS and access them through calls to a dedicated API. Figure 1 visualizes the out-flows and in-flows of the province of Padua (region of Veneto, north-east of the country), for February 18th (before the lockdown, on the left) and March 24th (during the lockdown, on the right). The chart shows the flows among provinces with a stroke width proportional to the flows. The out-flows (in-flow) are first linked to the corresponding region and then to the final destination (origin). During the lockdown, we observe a drastic reduction of both the in-and the out-flows (reported on labels in the corresponding circle), as well as a reduction of the number of provinces the flows are coming from or are directed to. The reduction in the number of provenances and destinations is also evident in the other provinces of the country. For example, Figure 2 shows this pattern is even more pronounced for the province of Bari, in the region of Puglia in the south-east of the country. 0.14 7% 0.14 7%",

The circles on the left have an area proportional to the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in the corresponding province up to March 24th. We find a progressive reduction of both the in-and out-flow diversity as time goes by, with an acceleration of the process soon after the beginning of the national lockdown (March 9th). Before the lockdown, the in-and out-flow diversities are slightly higher at the weekends than the weekdays. The opposite is true during the lockdown: the in-and out-flow diversities are considerably lower at the weekends than the weekdays. This exciting result suggests that: (i) the provenience and the destination of a province's mobility flows during the lockdown are more predictable than before the lockdown; (ii) regarding the weekends, the provenience and destination of flows are more diverse before the lockdown than during it.

We selected four Italian provinces: Bergamo, Padua, Bari, and Catania. For each of these provinces, we computed the evolution day by day of three types of flow:Figure 3shows the evolution of the normalized in-flows, out-flows, and self-flows of the selected provinces. It is evident how all provinces have a net decrease of the in-, out-and self-flows soon after the first national lockdown (March 9th), and a stabilization of the flows on the new volume after around one week, from March 15th. Therefore, subsequent ordinances, such as closing factories on March 17th, have had a minor impact on the reduction of mobility flows.An important aspect of the mobility of a province is the diversification of the provenience and the destination of people. Specifically, we define the in-flow diversity of a province A as the Shannon entropy of the in-flows to the province[12]:",
