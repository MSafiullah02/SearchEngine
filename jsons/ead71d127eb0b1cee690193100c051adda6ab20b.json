As Italy is experiencing a chronic shortage of healthcare workers, the government announced a plan to recruit 20 000 new doctors, nurses and hospital employees, to meet public demand, on 9 March. 6 Retired doctors may be called on as well as residents who have completed their medical degree and are in the final year of specialist training. Meanwhile, doctors who have come into contact with patients affected by COVID-19 are encouraged to work unless they show symptoms of the infection or have a positive test for SARS-CoV-2. However, allowing untested healthcare personnel to take care of patients may be a double-edged sword due to the fact that undocumented infections may be the primary source of documented cases. 7 Moreover, shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE) appear to be widespread across the health service and include general practitioner practices as well as hospitals.",

In the first article focusing on oncological cases affected by COVID-19, Liang and colleagues concluded that the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection was higher in patients with cancer who deteriorated more rapidly in the clinic and had a higher risk of severe events including the necessity for admission to the ICU or death. 14 Older age remained the only risk factor associated with severe events from SARS-CoV-2 infection among patients with cancer. The authors suggested three measures for reducing the burden of COVID-19 in oncology in endemic areas: to postpone treatments or elective surgery for stable cancer in endemic areas, to provide stronger personal protection provisions to patients and, finally, to offer more intensive surveillance or treatment for patients infected with SARS-CoV-2. 14 In this situation of emergency for healthcare systems, the inability to receive needed medical services is an additional concern. 15 The issue on how to organise cancer care during the COVID-19 pandemic is crucial. 16 In order to provide some guidance on cancer care during the Italian SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, the Italian Association of Medical Oncology (AIOM) in partnership with the boards of Academic Oncologists (COMU) and of Oncology Unit Directors (CIPOMO) has recently proposed some critical recommendations for patients currently receiving active treatments, those in follow-up (ie, out of active treatment), as well as for the admission of patients and their caregivers to the hospital. 17 For patients currently receiving active treatments, oncologists are invited to consider, on a case-by-case basis, the possibility of a delay in treatment administration. The decision of confirming the scheduled administration or delaying treatment should be based on the biological features of the tumour, the clinical condition of the patient with his/her symptoms, treatment characteristics (ie, expected benefit and adverse events including myelosuppression), disease response to current anticancer therapy, and the potential risks for an infection with SARS-CoV-2. An alert about the use of checkpoint inhibitors is raised by the identification of the cytokine storm-induced hyperinflammation as a pathogenetic mechanism for COVID-19-associated pneumonia of severe clinical scenarios. 18 However, it should be recognised that an evidence-based estimation of the impact of treatment delay or interruption on the risk/benefit balance for each individual patient is currently lacking.",

In these particular situations, such strategies could also help to alleviate patient isolation and loneliness by psychological interventions. Although 'telehealth' cannot be the only future strategy of medicine considering the relevance of patient-doctor interactions which are of special relevance in the field of oncology, the current crisis of the healthcare system necessitates the use of electronic communication as a valid tool to further optimise cancer care (eg, management of follow-up visits, oral therapies, etc) in such difficult circumstances.",

Special considerations related to this regard should be highlighted and faced also considering the particular heterogeneity of available resources in the different units across the country (Box 1). The Food and Drug Administration, the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and the Italian Medicines Agency have issued special guidance for the conduction of clinical trials during the COVID-19 emergency. [21] [22] [23] Despite all these challenges associated with the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy, we as professionals who take care of a frequently frail patient population in a delicate phase of their life should make all the possible efforts to mitigate the risk of suboptimal management of patients with cancer including those with concurrent COVID-19 infection. Considering the added extra burden of the epidemic for our patients and for all healthcare providers, also including the hard consequences of social distancing and isolation as well as a restriction in family interactions, the provision of encouragement and emotional help is essential. Our generation is facing such a tremendous crisis for the first time, but our commitment and extra energy as young oncologists are crucial to fight and succeed in this difficult situation which calls for the continuation of the provision of compassionate and safe care for our patients with cancer.",
