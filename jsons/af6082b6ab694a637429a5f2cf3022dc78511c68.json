Rapid responses are vital to control the pathogen yet also affect the communication network between highly specialized cells that control all host cognitive and vital functions. 1-3 CNS resident cells express few, if any, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules in the quiescent state, thus minimizing the potential to activate T cells. Immunological activity in the CNS is also restrained by the absence of a dedicated lymphatic drainage system and constitutive secretion of neurotrophins and TGF-\u03b2. [3] [4] [5] Lastly, tight junctions between endothelial cells associated with the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and the limited expression of adhesion molecules limit large molecules, e.g., antibodies, as well as T cells from entering the CNS. 2, 5 Although a small number of activated/memory T cells randomly patrol the CNS in the absence of 'danger' signals, they disappear in the absence of antigen recognition. 2 This quiescent steady state contrasts dramatically with the vigorous inflammatory responses induced following many CNS infections. 3, 4 Infections of the murine CNS by neurotropic coronaviruses provide excellent model systems that illustrate the interactions of innate immune responses with adaptive host effector mechanisms and the control of virus replication at the cost of immune pathology.",

            "text": "Infection by the neurotropic mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) strain JHMV produces an acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis in mice. [6] [7] [8] Survivors have no detectable infectious virus by approx. 2 weeks postinfection (p.i.), yet viral antigen and more prominently RNA remain detectable exclusively within the CNS up to 2 years p.i. Despite exploitation of various T cell-mediated functions to control acute virus infection in distinct cell types, host regulatory mechanisms, presumably designed to protect CNS integrity, contribute to the failure to eliminate virus. An enigma has been the inability to isolate persisting virus from CNS explants or from immunosuppressed mice perfused to remove neutralizing antibody (Ab) prior to explant. Although survivors exhibit little or no clinical abnormalities, histological examination shows ongoing primary CNS demyelination, similar to the pathological changes associated with multiple sclerosis. Clues that virus may persist in a replication competent form were provided by mice genetically impaired in anti-viral Ab production. 9, 10 Despite initial effective clearance of infectious virus, virus recrudesced in the absence of anti-viral Ab. The majority of data discussed in this review pertains to a monoclonal Ab neutralization JHMV escape mutant, designated 2.2v-1. 11 Microglia, astrocytes, and oligodendroglia are primary targets of infection. Neurons are only rarely infected, sparing mice from death due to neuronal dysfunction. Survival and demyelination associated with chronic infection is thus significantly enhanced. Furthermore, hepatitis, potentially interfering with CNS specific immune responses, is",

            "text": "JHMV CNS infection induces rapid, coordinated expression of chemokines, matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), the tissue inhibitor of MMPs (TIMP-1), and pro-inflammatory cytokines. [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] MMP activation is associated with several physiological processes, including the influx of inflammatory cells into tissues, activation of cytokines, and CNS pathology. 19 Neutrophils, macrophages, and natural killer (NK) cells are the initial inflammatory cells recruited into the MHV-infected CNS. 20, 21 Secretion of pre-packaged MMP-9 by neutrophils contributes to a loss of BBB integrity and facilitates subsequent entry of inflammatory cells into the infected CNS. 20 JHMV infection itself only induces a subset of MMPs in CNS resident cells, namely MMP-3 and MMP-12. 18 , 22 However, their roles in cell migration or pathology are unclear. A potential mechanism for counteracting MMPmediated CNS pathology may reside in sustained elevation of mRNA encoding the MMP inhibitor, TIMP-1. 18, 19 The earliest chemokines induced following infection are CXCL10 and CCL3. 12, 23 CXCL10 overexpression in the CNS using a recombinant MHV revealed that excessive NK cell accumulation in immunodeficient RAG1 -/mice may contribute to virus clearance. 24 By contrast, despite early NK cell recruitment, there is little evidence of a direct anti-viral role to combat wildtype virus. Their potential to secrete IFN-\u03b3 may, however, facilitate antigen presentation via upregulation of MHC class I and class II molecules. Increased CCL3 expression appears to link the innate and adaptive immune responses by stimulating recruitment, activation, and maturation of dendritic cells and T cells. 23, 25 Accumulation of macrophages, comprising the largest fraction of innate infiltrates, is enhanced by CCL5. 12 , 26, 27 Cytokines rapidly induced within the MHV infected CNS include IL-1\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and IL-12. [13] [14] [15] [16] These cytokines vary in expression levels, but not overall pattern between distinct MHV variants. 15 TNF-\u03b1, IL-12, and IL-1\u03b2 are induced in resident CNS cells in response to viral infection. 13, 16 The absence of TNF-\u03b1 neither alters MHV replication in vivo nor CNS pathology. 28, 29 The innate CNS inflammatory response induced by MHV infection is succeeded by a prominent adaptive response, which peaks at 7-10 days p.i. 20, 21, 30, 31 Although JHMV replication is undetectable at peripheral sites, virus-specific T cells are detected in the cervical lymph nodes (CLN) and spleen, prior to the CNS. 31 Initial virus replication in 342 extremely rare after intracerebral (i.c.) infection.",

Although CXCL9, CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, CCL5, and CCL7 are expressed during acute infection, CXCL10 is the most prominent and sustained chemokine. 12 In addition to attracting NK cells, 24 CXCL9 and CXCL10 recruit activated T cells 33, 34 and potentially plasmablasts, 35 via the CXCR3 receptor. Increasing T-cell accumulation coincides with a decline in neutrophils and NK cells; however, macrophages persist in the CNS. 21 The T cell-mediated reduction in CNS viral burden results in a decline in CXCL9, CCL2, CCL3, and CCL7 12 as well as IL-1\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-12, and IFN-\u03b2 mRNA. 13 By contrast, the T-cell chemoattractants CXCL10 and CCL5 remain elevated 12 correlating with increased T-cell recruitment and IFN-\u03b3 expression. 13, 30 Peak IFN-\u03b3 mRNA coincided with peak T-cell infiltration and is functionally evident by maximal expression of both MHC class I and II on microglia. 13, 21, 36 In the absence of IFN-\u03b3, MHC class I expression is reduced and MHC class II remains undetectable on microglia and most macrophages. 21, 36 IFN-\u03b3 is thus crucial in facilitating interactions between immune effectors and CNS resident cells.",

CD4 + T cells cross the BBB and accumulate around blood vessels. 37 By contrast, CD8 + T cells migrate into the parenchyma potentially guided by sites of virus replication. The differential ability of T-cell subsets to traffic through the infected tissue is linked to TIMP-1 expression by CD4 + but not CD8 + T cells. 22 These findings implicate the novel concept that migration into the CNS parenchyma is not only controlled by proteases that promote migration but also by protease inhibitors potentially stalling migration.",

A role for viral persistence and/or continuing pathology in maintaining T-cell retention is supported by the complete loss of T cells from the CNS after infection with a neurotropic MHV not associated with persistence or myelin loss. 40 A virus driven component was also suggested by selection of CD8 + T-cell populations with limited T-cell receptor specificities during persistence compared with the acute infection. 49 Finally, virusinduced TNF-\u03b1 secretion by CD8 + T cells during both acute infection and persistence is low, 47 suggesting that T-cell retention within the CNS may be due to decreased secretion of apoptosis inducing factors. The contribution of local homeostatic proliferation or ongoing recruitment to T-cell maintenance in the CNS remains unclear. Preliminary evidence suggests that IL-15, which regulates antigen-independent homeostasis of memory cells in lymphoid organs, 50 is not required (Bergmann, unpublished) .

By contrast, the MHV A59 strain, which infects both the liver and CNS, fails to reactivate in the liver in the absence of humoral immunity. 52 Whether this is due to the absence of viral persistence in liver, or reflects a fundamental difference in immune control in these two organs is unclear. Preexisting virus neutralizing Ab provides protection against MHV-induced CNS, 6 presumably by limiting virus replication after transport into the CNS parenchyma while BBB integrity is compromised. 18 Similarly, virus recrudescence in the CNS of Ab deficient mice can be prevented by transfer of polyclonal Ab at the time infectious virus is initially cleared. 9 Dissection of the specificities and mechanisms of Ab-mediated protection revealed that only spike (S) protein specific neutralizing IgG prevented recrudescence. 53 Non-neutralizing Ab specific for S, matrix, or nucleocapsid proteins had no anti-viral effect, 53 distinct from the apparent protective role for non-neutralizing Ab prior to infection. 6 Despite the initial promise of protection, antiviral control waned as transferred Ab decayed in B cell-deficient recipients. 53 These data suggested that virus is maintained in a replication competent form within the CNS and that sustained intrathecal Ab is crucial to maintain virus at undetectable levels during persistence.",

Cross-talk is indicated by enhanced CD8 + T-cell function and survival in the presence of CD4 + T cells. Distinct cellular targets of infection have differential susceptibility to T-cell effector function. The accumulation and maintenance of virus-specific ASC in the CNS, coupled with reactivation of infectious virus in the absence of antibody, indicates that antibody secretion within the CNS and not T-cell immunity is absolutely critical for the control of MHV CNS persistence. Lastly, retention of both T cells and ASC in the CNS during persistence suggests myelin loss is associated with an ongoing immune response, sustained by low-level oligodendroglial infection.",

Bystander cells further did not acquire expression of ex vivo cytolytic activity, suggesting that bystander CD8 + T-cell recruitment alone is unlikely to directly result in immune pathology in the absence of cognate or cross-reactive antigen. 39 These results are consistent with the requirement for an antigen-driven component in contributing to CD8 + T cell-mediated CNS damage observed in other models. 61, 62 ",
