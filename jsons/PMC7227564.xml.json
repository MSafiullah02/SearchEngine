The challenging issues include the security concerns as the main background to develop this approach is based upon the effective cloud-connected database. The interoperability is another concern in addition to the data security during IoMT functioning. There is always a need to create a dynamic, connected scheme to merge these advanced digital facilities following the medical facilities and services. In providing more impactful training to the medical personnel, the future investigations should be targeted to create additional sessions for creating further clinical reasoning, more targets to be set for poor and remote locations during COVID-19 period, the differential diagnosis for symptom localization, joint & soft tissue assessment studies, etc. Moreover, further research should be attempted to create a more digital resolution for the muscle stretching techniques, thoracic manipulation, locking tactics for spines, cloud data based prescription for spine exercise, etc.",

The effective interconnected system of devices, applications, internet, database, etc. helps the consumers to avail the services smartly. IoMT also promotes its services by developing the quality culture of smart-healthcare or mobile-clinic. It is a \u2018game-changer technology\u2019 which may completely change the practices in the field of orthopaedic globally. Even its quality services in this tough time making this approach more fruitful and worthwhile. The IoMT help in monitoring and tracking of older individuals, patients in remote locations for their healthcare requirements. We believe that the traditional health care is likely to witness a significant paradigm shift in the near future, as the digital transformation would put advanced technology and its connected products in the hands of the patients and provide both the patients and the physicians in the remote locations better access to the quality health care facilities.",
