Although MERS\u2010CoV RNA has been detected in dromedary camel nasal secretions, saliva, faeces and milk (Farag et al., 2015; Haagmans et al., 2015; Reusken et al., 2014), and in human urine samples (Corman et al., 2016), so far no evidence has been obtained for the presence of the virus in dromedary urine (Adney et al., 2014; Ali et al., 2017). However, it has been speculated that, amongst others, collection and consumption of urine from acutely infected camels might create circumstances for cross\u2010species transmission event (Gossnere et al., 2016; MacKay, 2015). Dromedary camel urine plays an ancient traditional and religious role in daily life in the Middle East and North Africa region as well as in parts of Asia. Camel urine is believed to have therapeutic effects in the treatment of cancer, diabetes, certain infectious and cardiovascular diseases as well as in the treatment of hair and skin problems. Hence, fresh urine is consumed, used to wash body and hair, and is a component in ointments (Alkhamees, 2017; Gader, 2016) for example it has been described that Bedouins in the Middle East have a daily consumption of 100 ml camel urine while a study amongst 156 Saudi cancer patients showed that 15.7% drank camel urine (Abuelgasim, 2018; Al\u2010Yousef et al., 2012).",

            "text": "Here, we investigated the presence of MERS\u2010CoV RNA and specific antibodies in urine of camels that were offered for slaughter at the central slaughterhouse in Doha, Qatar in March 2014. Qatar has reported 19 MERS cases as of August 2018 (WHO, 2019). Camels at the Doha slaughterhouse were shown to have a high prevalence of MERS\u2010CoV RNA shedding. A previous study showed that 59% of the camels had evidence for virus shedding in at least one type of swab at the time of slaughter (Farag, 2014). Urine from 23 camels, aged 4 months to 10 years (median 6 months), was collected aseptically post\u2010slaughter from intact bladders using 20 ml syringes. The collected urine was stored at \u221280\u00b0C until RNA extraction as described before (Reusken, 2014). The urine was analysed for the presence of MERS\u2010CoV using a screening RT\u2010PCR targeting the UpE region and a confirmatory RT\u2010PCR targeting the N\u2010gene as described before (Farag, 2015). We interpreted the urine results in the context of the presence of MERS\u2010CoV RNA and antibodies in each respectively same\u2010time collected nasal swab and serum sample (data in Farag, 2015). In none of the 23 urine samples, MERS\u2010CoV RNA could be detected while of the corresponding 23 nasal swabs 11 camels tested positive using both tests. The same urine samples were analysed for the presence of MERS\u2010CoV\u2010specific antibodies using micro\u2010array technology (Reusken, Haagmans, et al., 2013; Reusken, Mou, et al., 2013). We found MERS\u2010CoV specific antibodies in 16 of 23 urine samples while all camels showed such evidence for a (previous) MERS\u2010CoV infection in serum. Based on the observed relative fluorescence, the overall reactivity of the antibodies in sera was higher than of those present in urine (Data not shown). The specificity of the antibodies detected in the serum samples was confirmed by virus neutralization (Reusken, Haagmans, et al., 2013).",

These results are in line with data obtained from another field study and experimentally infected dromedaries, indicating the absence of MERS\u2010CoV in camel urine (Adney, 2014; Ali, 2017). It should be noted that failure to detect the virus in urine in the former field investigation (Ali, 2017), in contrast to our study, was not linked to dromedaries with MERS\u2010CoV RNA in their nasal swab. Together the studies imply the absence of a role of camel urine in MERS\u2010CoV transmission to humans. However, to establish unequivocally that urine does not play a role in zoonotic transmission of MERS\u2010CoV a large cohort study may be needed including animals of different age groups and at different stages of infection with simultaneous and longitudinal sampling of urine, serum and swabs. In the absence of results of such a systematic study, prudence towards consumption of raw camel urine is still indicated.",
