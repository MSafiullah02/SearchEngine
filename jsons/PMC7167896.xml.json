Already in prehistory, the art found in European caves reflects the early hunter\u2010gatherers appreciation of animals\u2014their speed, proportions, activities, and perhaps, most importantly, their food value.\n1\n About 5,000\u201310,000 years ago, the more agriculturally complex societies led humans to experience many closer contacts with animals through domestication\u2014primarily for nourishment, labor, and travel. Many humans with such contacts in these early periods must have experienced novel severe diseases, now termed zoonoses,\na\n whose causality evolved from animal infectious agents that spread through vectors or had become contagious in humans (e.g., the plague or measles). In relation to the older zoonoses, descendants of surviving men and women over many generations would have developed at least partial immunity to the infectious agents. Through exploration, conquests, and war, world history was markedly affected when \u201cvirginal\u201d or naive populations, particularly in America and on the Australian continent, experienced the disastrous consequences from such older zoonotic infections.\n2\n, \n3\n We have experienced many emerging zoonotic diseases in the past century, but the most rapidly spreading global one has been human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)\u20101, which is primarily spread sexually.",

A particularly important historical example is Giovanni Lancisi, an Italian physician, who, in 1713, was dispatched by Pope Clement to investigate and provide descriptions of an outbreak in Rome of the \u201ccattle plague,\u201d or rinderpest. Lancisi was probably the first to suggest its \u201ccontagious\u201d nature, as being due to \u201csome exceedingly fine and pernicious particles, which pass from one body to another, by contact.\u201d He also pioneered public health preventive measures by restricting the movement of cattle from areas in which there were many diseased animals.\n5\n Such a policy was among those used later to eradicate rinderpest, the progenitor of the measles virus, from the world in 2010; a similar concept led William Foege and others to vaccinate the people in the areas around infected communities, as part of the eradication of global smallpox in 1980.\n6\n This was accomplished by using the vaccine resulting from the one health\u2013one medicine consciousness extant in the 18th century, when the English physician, Edward Jenner\u2014with encouragement by John Hunter\u2014adapted the cowpox virus as a live vaccine for humans.\n7\n Coincidently, widespread use of cowpox vaccines in humans may have initially promoted transmission back to cattle from recent vaccines; eventually, this practice reduced transmission of cowpox between cattle, thus indirectly controlling and later eliminating the disease in dairy herds.",

In addition, major contributions to both fields were made by Louis Pasteur, a chemist, assisted by several physicians in his laboratory.\n9\n The French and the German schools led by Robert Koch, joining in the new fields of bacteriology and immunology, identified many new bacteria in animals and humans. Their findings were instrumental in the diagnosis of many diseases and in the burgeoning immunological application to prevention and treatment.\n10\n, \n11\n Clinical pathology also became particularly prominent in its applicability to a better understanding of animal and human diseases, by such physicians as Robert Koch, Paul Ehrlich, William Osler, and Rudolph Virchow. The latter put it best: \u201cBetween animal and human medicine there is no dividing line\u2014nor should there be one.

A professor of veterinary epidemiology with broad medical experience, Calvin Schwabe, was instrumental in the 1960s to reintegrate the two in his textbook Veterinary Medicine and Human Health.\n13\n One of us (JHS), who also reviewed the book,\n14\n helped to extend this theme to include veterinary and human public health, through different contributions to national and global public health.\n15\n, \n16\n At Steele's 90th birthday celebration in 2003, William Foege noted the success of this integrative concept, \u201cWe made the point at the Center for Disease Control (CDC), the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), the World Health Organization (WHO), and everywhere, that you cannot deal with the health of people without dealing with the health of animals\u2014the two are inseparable.\u201d\n17\n We propose now to further integrate such unifying concepts, with the inclusion of many more relevant disciplines, to emphasize the evolutionary paradigm. The large diversity of causal viruses, bacteria, and parasites that can assume a sexual route of transmission represents a very large number of important diseases, including (re)emerging ones, in humans and many animal species. While the historical view is more limited with its shorter observation time on sexually transmitted diseases, the evolutionary and related perspectives can extend over \u201cdeep time\u201d our comprehension of the causal infectious agents and interactions with their diverse hosts.",

Of particular relevance is the 1980 Nobel Symposium on \u201cThe Evolution of Sex,\u201d\n21\n and the more recent 1998 book on Primate Sexuality by Alan Dixson,\n22\n the latter comparing mating patterns of monkeys, apes, and humans. Some of these differences relate to the very short period of penile\u2013vaginal intromission of nonhuman primates, as well as the more limited seasonal period of mating based on hormonal effects. One can also gather, from these different aspects, that the likelihood of infectious agents being transmitted sexually will vary accordingly (Table 1).",

Oriel and A.H. Hayward, admonished their physician \u201cvenereologists\u201d to pay more attention to sexually transmitted diseases and their causal infectious agents in animals, providing some interesting comparisons to humans and their agents.\n24\n About two decades later, Janis Antonovics and his evolutionary biology team in the United States, provided an extensive comparative evolutionary review of sexually transmitted infectious agents, not only in mammals, but also in insects and plants. The year of publication was 1996,\n25\n around the same time as the first genome sequencing of any microbial agent\u2014Hemophilus influenzae.\n26\n Since that time, molecular biology has advanced almost logarithmically, being applied to various (proto)human, animal, and plant organisms and an increasing number of viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites that acquired the potential of sexual transmission over very long or sometimes short periods of time. Such information has helped to place evolution in its newer paradigm for basic and practical workers in the field, particularly for the kind of questions and possible answers that might be gleaned. It is important to note that focus is placed on a variety of infectious agents that can assume sexual transmission primarily in nature. Experimental studies on the evolution of drug resistance in the agents themselves, for example, bacterial, viral, or parasitic resistance to drugs, are of course most relevant (see later).",

The historic overuse of antimicrobial agents in human medicine has been acknowledged for some time, with some measurable progress made in continuing efforts to reduce the excess usage. A different approach extends through most of the animal health and veterinary communities particularly in managing antibiotic administration to livestock and, less so, to companion animals. Specifically in the case of livestock, continuing use of antibiotics at subtherapeutic dosages is employed for assuring optimal feed conversion ratios and to some extent as a prophylactic measure to control disease, especially in intensive concentrated animal feeding operations. The actual means by which feed conversion is enhanced remains not fully explained, and was serendipitously discovered from feeding leftover mash from chlortetracycline antibiotic production to chickens.\n32\n DuPont and Steele have offered a balanced summary of this issue noting, \u201cWhile the extensive body of knowledge that exists on the subject provides convincing evidence that the widespread use of antimicrobial drugs as feed additives in animal populations has economic benefits, minimal convincing evidence exists that the practice poses substantial hazards to human health.\u201d\n33\n\n",

While caused by porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV\u20102) virus, a high percentage of pigs are coinfected with torque teno virus, genotypes 1 and 2 (TTV\u20101 and TTV\u20102), and two viruses, as well as a novel porcine bocavirus.

In yet another effort, soft ticks collected in Uganda were tested, using random amplification and large\u2010scale sequencing.

(2) The lack of a phylogenetic homology between the Trichomonas fetus of cows and T.vaginalis of humans raises some important general points. Although two infectious agents of the same genus can assume a similar mode of sexual transmission, this does not imply necessarily a close phylogenetic relation of the agents themselves; nor does a close phylogenetic relation between, for instance, a sexually transmitted bovine herpesvirus and a human herpesvirus indicate that humans originated from cows. (3) The short\u2010 or long\u2010term temporal perspective is well illustrated by the koalas. In these marsupial animals, the severe reproductive diseases caused by Chlamydia pecorum (also identified in sheep and cows) likely emerged in recent decades; on the other hand, ERV genes, associated with cancer in the koala, originated several thousand years ago. (4) The transmission of HIV\u20101 to humans from chimpanzees less than a century ago has already caused a global pandemic of over 30 million infections in men, women, and children, whereas the less virulent and more geographically limited HIV\u20102 was acquired most likely from sooty mangabees (SM).
