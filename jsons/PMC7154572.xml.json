EBOV belongs to the filovirus family and affects the liver (Pallesen et al. 2016). EBOV requires different host factors during the life cycle (Cantoni and Rossman 2018; Ibrahim et al. 2019). The 2015 outbreak of EBOV caused more than 10,000 deaths with hemorrhagic fever as the main characteristic effect (El gohary et al. 2019). The ease with which the virus spread (via body fluids) and its high mortality rate made EBOV a global health threat of international concern (El gohary et al. 2019). The current development in drug design to eradicate the virus, using direct-acting antivirals (DAA), has reduced the momentum of viral spreading (Elfiky 2019; Gonzalez-Grande et al. 2016; Yang et al. 2011).",

            "text": "The upregulation of specific cellular proteins that mediate the alleviation mechanisms to reduce stress is induced by the unfolded protein response (UPR) mechanism in stressed cells. Heat shock proteins (HSP), the chaperones, are among those proteins that are upregulated under stress, as in viral infection or some types of cancers (Ibrahim et al. 2019). Glucose-regulated protein 78 (GRP78), a member named HSPA5 (Kampinga et al. 2009) of the HSP70 chaperone family is termed the master of the UPR mechanism in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) (Gething and Sambrook 1992; Ibrahim et al. 2019; Lee 2005; Li and Lee 2006; Quinones et al. 2008; Rao et al. 2002). Under cellular stressors, HSPA5 releases activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6), protein kinase RNA-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), and inositol-requiring enzyme 1 (IRE1) because of the accumulation of unfolded proteins. The released enzymes cause inhibition of protein synthesis and enhancement of refolding mechanisms (Ibrahim et al. 2019; Shen et al. 2002). Subsequently, HSPA5 is upregulated and succeeds in escaping the ER retention (detected in the cytoplasm and over the cell membrane (cell-surface HSPA5)) (Ibrahim et al. 2019; Wu et al. 2014). Cell-surface HSPA5 is susceptible to pathogen recognition by viral envelope glycoproteins or fungal coat proteins (Gebremariam et al. 2014; Ibrahim et al. 2019). Pep42, a cyclic 13-residues peptide (CTVALPGGYVRVC) targets specifically cell-surface HSPA5 in vivo (Kim et al. 2006). It is used to deliver the chemotherapeutic, doxorubicin, to cancer cells presenting cell-surface HSPA5 (Ibrahim et al. 2019; Martin et al. 2010). Additionally, HSPA5 is reported to be associated with some viral proteins like spike protein in coronaviruses and E6 in human papillomavirus while the binding site was predicted (Elfiky 2020; Ibrahim et al. 2020). It was reported that HSPA5 is associated with EBOV in ER (Shurtleff et al. 2014). It was suggested that HSPA5 could be used as a drug target to stop EBOV infection (Shurtleff et al. 2014). In addition, EBOV glycoproteins GP1 and GP2 have been shown to accumulate in the ER of the infected cells, causing stress response (Bhattacharyya and Hope 2011).",

Four of these structures are solved by x-ray crystallography (5JQ3, 6MAM, 6EA7, and 6EA5), while the rest are solved by cryo-electron microscopy. All the solved structures have been released during the past 3 years. The PDB files and their corresponding FASTA sequence files are downloaded from the Protein Data Bank database (PDB). By the aid of PyMOL software (DeLano 2002), water, ions, and protein chains other than EBOV GP1 are removed from the PDB files. The same is done with the only available wild-type and full-length HSPA5 (x-ray crystallography solved structure PDB ID: 5E84 with 2.99 \u00c5 resolution) in the open conformation (Yang et al. 2015; Yang et al. 2017). It is important to use the open conformation of the HSP5A in which the SBD\u03b1 and SBD\u03b2 are apart from each other, and the substrate affinity to SBD\u03b2 is higher (Chiappori et al. 2016). The available sequences for EBOV GP1 found in the protein database of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) are downloaded (ten sequences found in the identical protein group database), and Clustal Omega is utilized to perform multiple sequence alignment (MSA) with the Pep42 sequence CTVALPGGYVRVC (Sievers et al. 2011). ESpript 3.0 is used to represent the MSA (Gouet et al. 1999). The C121\u2013C135 region of EBOV GP1 protein that fits well with Pep42 (33.3% identity) is analyzed by the ProtScale web server (ExPASy Bioinformatics Resource Portal) (Garg et al. 2016; Gasteiger et al. 2005). PyMOL is used to superimpose all the solved structures to show the structural conservation of the C121\u2013C135 region of EBOV GP1.",

In addition, EBOV GP1 active residues are chosen to be the C121\u2013C135 region. Protein-ligand interaction profiler (PLIP) web server (Salentin et al. 2015) was selected to assess the binding pattern after docking. Pep42 cyclic peptide (CTVALPGGYVRVC) model was built using I-TASSER web server (Zhang 2008). The protein/peptide docking software HPEPDOCK (Zhou et al. 2018) and HADDOCK were utilized to dock the cyclic Pep42 model into the binding site of HSPA5. A blind rigid docking scheme is used in HPEPDOCK without the binding site determination for HSPA5 to scan the possible binding sites. The easy interface of HADDOCK is utilized to dock the cyclic Pep42 peptide (all residues are treated as active) into HSPA5 SBD\u03b2 (I426, T428, V429, V432, T434, F451, S452, V457, and I459 are selected to be the active residues).",

Figure 1a shows part of the multiple sequence alignment (MSA) between the Pep42 sequence CTVALPGGYVRVC and the ten EBOV GP1 sequences downloaded from the NCBI protein database. A complete MSA is found in the supplementary file (Fig. S1). Five identical residues (compared with the Pep42 sequence) were found in the MSA of EBOV GP1 sequences, which are C121, A124, P126, G128, and C135 (the numbering is based on PDB ID: 5JQ3). Interestingly, both C121 and C135 form disulfide bonds (see the green numbers at the bottom of Fig. 1a) with C147 and C108, respectively. The presence of these disulfides suggests its contribution to the folding of GP1 and GP2, as mentioned in earlier work (Cantoni and Rossman 2018). Moreover, the cyclic peptide (Pep42) can target CS-HSPA5. The C121\u2013C135 region of EBOV GP1 is found in the \u03b2-turn region and the loop separating between the \u03b27 and \u03b28 secondary structure (see the top panel of Fig. 1a).",

A high degree of similarity in the hydrophobicity values for the EBOV GP1 C121\u2013C135 region supports the MSA data. The sequence, and thus the structural similarity of EBOV GP1 compared with Pep42, indicates its ability to bind cell-surface HSPA5 substrate-binding domain \u03b2 (SBD\u03b2). In addition, Fig. 1c shows the molecular surface of the peptide Pep42 and the C121\u2013C135 region of EBOV GP1. Three colors are used to represent the residues: highly hydrophobic residues in red (such as C, I, L, A, and V), low hydrophilicity residues in yellow (such as G, P, and T), and hydrophilic residues in green (such as D and R). As shown, the two structures show some hydrophobic patch that was reported previously to be the target regions for HSPA5. These hydrophobic residues of EBOV GP1 (C121, L122, A124, A125, I129, F132, and C135) are suggested to be the binding site for cell-surface HSPA5.",

The docking was made by HADDOCK as for the EBOV GP1 docking and by the peptide/protein docking software, HPEPDOCK. Docking scores are listed in the table, along with the interactions that were established after each docking experiment. On average, three H-bonds were formed with S452, T458, and K460 of the HSPA5. Eight hydrophobic interactions were found in the HADDOCK trial with I426, T428, V429, F451, and I459 of the HSPA5, while only five hydrophobic contacts were established in the case of the HPEPDOCK experiment (T428, V429, V432, and I450 of the HSPA5). Compared with EBOV GP1, the peptide Pep42 has the same pattern of interactions with HSPA5 (S452 and K460 for H-bonding while T428, V429, and F451 for hydrophobic contacts). This illustrates the possibility of recognition of the EBOV GP1 for cell-surface HSPA5 overexpressed on cancer cells or cells under other stressors.",

The viral protein GP1 is the crucial host-cell recognizing protein that enables viral entry. HSPA5 overexpression is reported to increase the infectivity of EBOV. Inhibiting HSPA5/EBOV GP1 binding would help in lowering the viral infection. The present work suggests the binding site of the viral/host-cell receptor utilizing in silico methods.
