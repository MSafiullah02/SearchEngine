Other recent research confirming the concept that inflammation is a critical component of tumor progression came from the study addressing correlation between oral bacterial infections and cancer. Inflammation caused by periodontal infections has been linked to cancer of the lung, kidney, pancreas, and hematologic and oral cancers (Pendyala et al. 2013).",

A model of the bacteria-induced acute lung inflammation was used to study its effect on lung metastasis in mice. Acute lung infection dramatically increased cancer cell homing to the lung and lung metastasis. It was also confirmed that the ubiquitin-CXCR4 axis plays an important role in these changes that were described as \u201cpreparation of a favorable metastatic niche\u201d (Yan et al. 2013).",

Almost 50 % of the adult patients with acute myeloid leukemia that are subjected to chemotherapy develop invasive fungal infections (Neofytos et al. 2013). In pediatric oncology invasive fungal infections are also a frequent and potentially fatal complication (Mor et al. 2011). Although solid tumors comprise the vast majority of cancers the morbidity and mortality due to fungal infections is higher in patients with hematologic malignancies. Invasive Aspergillus infection is one of the most common fungal infections that have been observed in patients with hematologic malignancy or those subjected to allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (de Naurois et al. 2010). About 70 % of the pediatric oncology patients developing fungal infections have myeloid leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia as their primary diagnosis (Mor et al. 2011).",

Antifungal drugs are often given prophylactically to patients with persistent fever, and are shown to decrease mortality rates (Johansen and Gotzsche 2014). Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole prophylactically administered before chemotherapy regimens has been shown to be effective in prevention of Pneumocystis pneumonia in children with solid tumors, leukemias and lymphomas (Caselli et al. 2014). However, caution in the choice of primary and secondary antifungal prophylaxis is recommended. The use of secondary prophylaxis may reduce systemic fungal infection frequency but at the same time increase the risk of colonization and infection with azole-resistant fungal strains (Gedik et al. 2014). Since it has been demonstrated that prolonged duration of neutropenia is one of the risk factors for onset of invasive Aspergillosis, addition of granulocyte-colony-stimulating factor into therapeutic and prophylactic protocols is recommended (van de Peppel et al. 2014).",

Of special importance are the still open questions about interplay of the antiviral and anti-tumor immunity mechanisms, effectiveness and timing of vaccination and its relevance to chemotherapy regimens in the pediatric and adult oncology practice. Despite the significant advances in management of pediatric cancer and influenza, the epidemiology and outcomes of influenza in pediatric oncology patients have not altered over the past several decades (Carr et al. 2012). Although influenza usually presents as a mild illness, children with hematological conditions and solid tumors are at increased risk for complications, which may lead to delay in anticancer therapy and increase in hospitalization and antibiotic usage (Ozdemir et al. 2011). Though influenza is the most common viral infection, is only one on the long list of viruses, such as H1N1, rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, human parechovirus, bocavirus, metapneumovirus, and human coronavirus occurring in about 30 % of neutropenic pediatric patients. Co-detection of these viruses is not uncommon, occurring in over 20 % of infections, in various combinations (Benites et al. 2014).",

Also of consideration is the problem of balancing the chemotherapy and antiviral medication regimens and the timing of their administration. For some patients chemotherapy has to be postponed until completion of the antiviral course of therapy, while others cannot be subjected to the viral infection therapy while under treatment for their cancer (Borchardt and Torres 2014).

Two major problems are currently associated with management of lung cancer in HIV patents. Its diagnosis is often late because of onset in a younger population and its being clinically masked by or as a pulmonary infection, which are common among HIV-infected individuals. In addition, although there is increasing experience in using radiation and chemotherapy for HIV-infected patients who do not have surgical options, there is a need for more prospective studies because this population is frequently excluded from participating in cancer trials (Mani et al. 2012).

Need for infection prophylaxis is also growing in hematopoietic cell transplant recipients. Due to overall improvement of this treatment during the last two decades the survival duration has increased but the incidence of post-transplantation infections, particularly those caused by respiratory viruses, has concomitantly increased with lifespan.

A multicenter observational study has found that in cancer and hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients with Influenza A (H1N1) the incidence of pneumonia was 66 % with an 18 % 30-day mortality, however no deaths were observed among vaccinated patients (Dignani et al. 2014). The study by Kim et al. addressed the immunogenicity of influenza vaccine in colorectal cancer patients based on antibody titers in blood samples. The data showed an acceptable immune response to an influenza vaccine without significant adverse effects, supporting the recommendation for annual influenza vaccination in colorectal cancer patients (Kim et al. 2013). A simple prognostic measure was proposed for evaluation of the vaccination response to H1N1 virus. The study demonstrated that an absolute lymphocyte count above the lower normal limits for age prior to vaccination predicted the positive response to influenza vaccination in pediatric cancer patients treated with chemotherapy (Mavinkurve-Groothuis et al. 2013).",

Classification of different subgroups among dendritic cells is much more complicated. Originally DCs were discovered as cells of myeloid origin with mainly antigen-presenting function and thus as cells which promote mechanisms in adaptive immunity (Steinman 1991). Later it was recognized that depending on the DCs\u2019 maturation status (Steinman et al. 2003), hematopoietic lineage of origin (Ma et al. 2012) and expression of co-stimulatory and MHC molecules they can play either immunostimulatory or tolerogenic, immunosuppressive roles (Hurwitz and Watkins 2012; Zhong et al. 2014). In addition, the change from immunostimulatory to tolerogenic status can be induced in DCs via different mechanisms by a number of malignancies. Also, it should be taken into consideration that over 60 % of malignancies arise in older populations, and hence the age-related decline in their hematopoietic cells\u2019 ability for self-renewal also contributes to an immunocompromised condition in cancer patients over 65 years old (Lipschitz 1995; Balducci et al. 2001; Shurin et al. 2007).",

With the onset of malignancy complicated networks of expression in the ligand/receptor axis and changes in signal transduction lead to alteration of the functional profiles of the DC subpopulations. This has a twofold outcome. On one hand it is part of the tumors defense mechanism, protecting the malignant mass from immune reactions and allowing its unhindered growth. On the other hand, the tolerogenic function of the DCs leads to generalized immunosuppression, which contributes to the onset of infectious diseases. During the last decade new insights into particular mechanisms contributing to the tumor-induced changes in DC function and the resultant increased susceptibility to infectious diseases were reported. They include both local and systemic mechanisms employed by the tumor to affect the DCs functions. Collectively they result in the inhibition of the DCs differentiation from hematopoietic progenitors (Shurin et al. 2001; Tourkova et al. 2004; Hargadon 2013) and changes in their phenotype and function (Zhong et al. 2014; Aalamian-Matheis et al. 2007; Karthaus et al. 2012; Chao et al. 2015).",

            "text": "Dendritic cells often accumulate in and around tumors. However, their mere presence does not reflect their input in overall immunity and hence doesn\u2019t have prognostic value. They could either be part of robust anti-tumor immunity (Esche et al. 1998; Iida et al. 2008) or they may play an essential role in tumor immune escape (Zhong et al. 2014; Wu et al. 2014; Dudek et al. 2013). DC phenotyping is a valuable tool in defining their maturation and functional status. Multiple groups have reported data contributing to an optimal phenotyping panel of markers for tolerogenic/regulatory DC in cancer. It was shown that in prostate cancer expression of CD83, CD86 and CD40 co-stimulatory molecules are decreased (Aalamian-Matheis et al. 2007). It was also reported that evaluation of the tumor-infiltrating DCs should be performed utilizing a larger panel including not only S-100 and CD1a, but also DC-SIGN, and DC-LAMP markers (Karthaus et al. 2012). Detection of DC-SIGN is of importance because it is an intercellular adhesion molecule which can interact with carbohydrate structures on some cancer cells. This interaction leads to immunosuppressive responses in DCs via inhibition of their maturation (Chao et al. 2015). Also it was suggested that different levels of expression of the MHC and co-stimulatory molecules have representative patterns for different subsets of regulatory DCs (Zhong et al. 2014).",

Evidence is mounting in support of their contribution to the processes of oncogenesis. A growing number of cancers have been shown to possess the ability to utilize different mechanisms attracting Treg cells and utilizing them in defense against immune reactions in an affected individual. The role of the Treg cells in enhancing the morbidity in cancer-associated infections is via local and generalized immunosuppression mechanisms. The trafficking patterns of the Treg cells can be altered by the tumor-secreted cytokines and chemokine molecules inducing their recruitment into the vicinity of the tumor and providing a malignant mass with \u2018a shield\u2019 that suppresses the anti-tumor immune responses. This allows for uninhibited tumor growth and also results in compromised anti- infection immunity. Among the list of this cohort of tumors are ovarian carcinoma (Curiel et al. 2004), breast tumors (Gobert et al. 2009), mesothelioma (Hegmans et al. 2006), Hodgkin lymphoma (Ishida et al. 2006), myelodysplastic syndromes (Kotsianidis et al. 2009), gastric cancers (Mizukami et al. 2008; Ohtani et al. 2009)., the malignant plural mesothelioma and effusions (Qin et al. 2009; Shimizu et al. 2009), and lung adenocarcinoma (Wald et al. 2006).

The effectiveness of Treg cell depletion in the regression of oral fibrosarcoma with an increase in survival was demonstrated utilizing a mouse model. Anti-CD25 Ab administration resulted in depletion of the Tregs and a complete regression of tumor (Whelan et al. 2014). The following studies proposed further modifications in the use of anti-CD25 Abs. It was shown that targeting the CD25Low subset assures the discerning depletion of the Treg cells among other CD25+ T cell populations (Weiss et al. 2012). CD73 is a cell surface enzyme that suppresses immunity. The adoptive experiments in the Treg-deficient mice have demonstrated that protumorogenic effects of Treg cells depend on the expression of CD73. In vivo blockade of CD73 with a selective inhibitor or anti-CD73 mAb reduced tumor growth and metastasis (Stagg et al. 2011). Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and TGF-\u03b2 play a role in induction of Treg cells. Interrupting the TGF-\u03b2 and PGE2 signaling pathways was suggested as an alternative approach for reduction of the tumor protective function of Treg cells (Baratelli et al. 2010). Interest in adaptation of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) transplantation for cancer therapy lead to the finding that migration of MSCs to the sites of tumor growth, which produced inhibition of Stat3 signaling, was associated with normalization of Treg numbers and dramatically reduced pulmonary and hepatic metastases (Ling et al. 2010). Foxp3 is an X-linked nuclear transcription factor that is considered a defining marker for the Treg population (Sakaguchi 2004; Hori et al. 2003). Recently it was shown that Foxp3 not only plays a dominant role in the development and function of Treg cells, but also is a tumor suppressor factor (Heinze et al. 2011). This finding is of special interest since it was demonstrated that Foxp3-based tumor cytotoxicity is mediated via different signaling pathways compared to that enhancing the Treg cell function. This discrimination allows development of target-specific therapies aimed at augmentation of the Treg cells anti-tumor effects and not in altering their immunosuppressive function (Heinze et al. 2011).",

The mechanisms evoking the immunocompromised condition in cancer of both origins and those contributing to higher incidence and more aggressive course of infectious complications in this group of patients are complex and interconnected. The highest risk for onset of infectious complications and associated morbidity and mortality is seen in patients receiving chemotherapy for treatment of hematologic malignancies. A common occurrence for these patients is development of neutropenia, which is due to chemically induced suppression of hemopoiesis already compromised by malignancy. Ironically, in some cases the incidence of infections has concomitantly increased with a lifespan prolonged due to successful anti-cancer therapy. Thus, the ultimate goal of discerning the dichotomy of chemotherapy-mediated anti-cancer and immunosuppressive effects is of direct impact on management of infections in these patients. It is especially important in light of increased antibiotic resistance. New insight in the DC and Treg cell-mediated reactions leading to morbidity in cancer patients with infectious complications permits development of novel target-specific immunomodulatory therapeutic approaches.",
