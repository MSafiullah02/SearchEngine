            "text": "Veterinary professionals can encounter a variety of occupational health risks. A high prevalence of injury has been reported, predominantly in relation to large animal work (BEVA, 2014, Fritschi et al., 2006, Lucas et al., 2009), dog and cat bites and/or scratches and scalpel or needle stick injuries (Nienhaus et al., 2005, Phillips et al., 2000, Soest and van Fritschi, 2004). In addition to the risk of injury, the profession is also at risk of other occupational hazards including exposure to chemicals, car accidents (Phillips et al., 2000) and infectious diseases from zoonotic pathogens (Constable and Harrington, 1982, Dowd et al., 2013, Epp and Waldner, 2012, Gummow, 2003, Jackson and Villarroel, 2012, Lipton et al., 2008, Weese et al., 2002). Work days lost because of zoonotic infections are less frequent than days lost to injury (Phillips et al., 2000); however, because of the potential seriousness of some zoonotic infections and increasing reports of occupationally-acquired antimicrobial resistant bacteria in veterinary professionals (Cuny and Witte, 2016, Groves et al., 2016, Hanselman et al., 2006, Jordan et al., 2011, Weese et al., 2006), zoonotic risk in the veterinary profession deserves attention.",

In one UK study, observed hand hygiene adherence in nurses was 20.4% and 60.1%, before and after contact with patients, respectively. In doctors in the same study, the compliance was much lower, at 8.1% and 51.4%, before and after patient contact (Jenner et al., 2006). Non-adherence to guidelines is a global issue, with reported hand hygiene compliance rates of 58% in hospitals in Finland (Laurikainen et al., 2015), 41.2% in an infectious diseases care unit in France (Boudjema et al., 2016) and 40% in paediatric hospitals in New York (L\u00f8yland et al., 2016).",

In addition, only a small proportion of large and equine vets washed their hands before eating, drinking or smoking at work (31.1% and 28.1%, respectively), compared with 55.2% in small animal vets. Veterinary surgeons who worked in a practice that had no formal infection control policy had lower awareness, as did male veterinary surgeons (Wright et al., 2008). In a smaller survey of American veterinary professionals, although 77% of respondents agreed it was important for veterinary surgeons to inform clients about the risk of zoonotic disease transmission, only 43% reported they initiated these discussions with clients (Lipton et al., 2008). In a study of veterinary technicians and support staff, only 41.7% reported washing their hands regularly between patients (Nakamura et al., 2012). In a sample of Australian veterinary surgeons, 43.4% wore no personal protective equipment (PPE) for handling clinically sick animals and the majority (67.4%) wore inadequate PPE for handling animal faeces and urine (Dowd et al., 2013).",

In both medical and veterinary medicine, education has been identified as a key intervention to increase compliance (Dowd et al., 2013, Ward, 2011); however good knowledge does not necessarily lead to good practice (Jackson et al., 2014). Compliance is influenced by many factors, including motivation, intention, social pressure and how individuals understand or \u2018construct\u2019 risk (Jackson et al., 2014). Understanding of risk and why people engage in risk-mitigating behaviour (or not) is complex and perceived knowledge of the disease is only one factor that should be considered.",

These might be expected to cluster within practice; the response from a veterinary surgeon and nurse from the same practice might not be completely independent. However, it was not feasible to introduce practice as a random effect, as not enough practices returned two responses (22.2% returned responses from a veterinary nurse and veterinary surgeon from the same practice). As with any questionnaire-based research, this study will be subject to an element of responder bias, and the relatively low response rate of this study may accentuate this bias. This is particularly evident with male nurses, who are few in number, making them difficult to target using random selection methods. According to the latest RCVS annual report, male nurses represented just 2.1% of the total veterinary nurse population in the UK (RCVS, 2014), in the present study, 6% (95% CI 1.7\u201310.4) of respondents were male nurses. The RCVS database used to sample the veterinary population for this study does not contain information on specialism or type of practice, therefore it is not possible to assess whether this sample is representative of the wider veterinary profession. However, the demographic data on respondents are similar to data from the RCVS annual report; the mean age in our study was 42 years, compared with 41 years in the annual report. In addition, the gender split was similar; in our study, 61.1% (95% CI 55.1\u201367.1) of respondents were female and the RCVS reported 57.1% were female (RCVS, 2014). Despite similarities between the respondents and the veterinary population in the UK, the low response rate means the results from this sample may not necessarily be generalisable to the wider veterinary population, however this study is the first to provide these baseline data on attitudes and beliefs regarding zoonoses in the British veterinary population, which can be built on with future studies.",

Improving education provided to veterinary professionals may help improve compliance with SOPs and infection control practices to a certain extent, however this study has highlighted that increased knowledge does not necessarily equate to exhibiting risk-mitigating behaviour. This suggests construction of risk is complex, circumstance-specific and can be influenced by a number of different internal and external factors.
