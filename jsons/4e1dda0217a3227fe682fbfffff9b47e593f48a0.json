            "text": "Rossmann-like fold 1,2 is the most populated fold among a/b-folds in the Protein Data Bank. 3 It was first found in a wide range of nucleotide-binding proteins that utilize diphosphate-containing cofactors such as NAD(H). These structures included two sets of b-a-b-a-b units (321456 topology), forming a single parallel sheet flanked of a three layer a/b/a sandwich. 4 An important structural feature of this fold includes a crossover observed between strands 3 and 4. This crossover creates a natural cavity that participates in the binding of the nucleotide ring. 5 We can therefore define a minimal Rossmann-like motif as a three-layer a/b/a sandwich with at least three parallel b-strands and a crossover between the second and third strands. In fact, protein structures containing this minimal defined unit constitute 22% of the Protein Data Bank (see \"Materials and methods\"). Rossmann domains are linked to a great variety of different catalytic domains and metabolic enzymes and can be found in different viruses. 6 As an abundant life form that infects practically all organisms, viruses are a major cause of human suffering and economic loss. Previous studies showed that in marine, soil, and animal-associated environments, the number of virus particles is typically 10-100 times greater than the number of cells. 7 This so-called \"virosphere\" is probably inclusive of every environment on the Earth, from the atmosphere to the deep biosphere. 8 The viromes of the three domains of cellular life (bacteria, archea, and eukaryotes) are fundamentally different. In prokaryotes, most have double-stranded DNA genomes, with a substantial minority of single-stranded DNA viruses and only limited presence of RNA viruses. On the other hand, in eukaryotes, RNA viruses account for the majority of the virome diversity, although ssDNA and dsDNA viruses are common as well. 9 Although several families of dsDNA viruses are represented in both bacteria and archea, no viruses are known to be shared by eukaryotes with any of the other two cellular domains, even at the family or order level. 10 However, structural analyses of virion architecture and coat protein topology have revealed unexpected similarities, not visible in sequence comparisons, suggesting a common origin for viruses that infect hosts residing in different domains of life. 11 Given the prevalence of Rossmann-like folds in nature, their analysis in the viral structure proteome could provide an understanding of viral biology and evolution as well as could propose possible targets for antiviral therapy.",

The rising tide of antibiotic resistance coupled with the low rate of antibiotic discovery has revived interest in phages as antibacterial agents. 14 Phages have been used not only to treat and prevent human bacterial infections but also to control plant diseases, detect pathogens, and assess food safety. E.coli bacteriophages are the most popular objects for these purposes, 14 which perhaps explains their relative abundance of structures (Fig. 1 ). Our analysis detected 14 different bacterial virus structure topology types defined by ECOD T-groups that contain a Rossmann-like fold (Fig. 2, 12 topology groups shown). The largest \"Rossmann-related\" homology group (2003.1) adopts a classical Rossmann-like topology with additional b-strands at the C-terminal end for several families [ Fig. 2(A,B) ]. The tubulin family [ Fig. 2(B) ] of this homology group has a sheet topology 321456 representing a canonical GTPbinding domain. Pseudomonas phiKZ-like bacteriophages encode a group of related tubulin/FtsZ-like proteins believed to be essential for the correct centering of replicated bacteriophage virions within the bacterial host. 15 This phage protein classifies together with bacterial and archeal FtsZ proteins as well as eukaryotic tubulin alpha, beta, and gamma chains. The similar protein sequence and structure, in addition to the GTP-dependent polymerization activities suggest all evolved from a common ancestor.",

Given the idea that PMVK enzymes arose from nonorthologous gene displacement early in animal evolution, 16 perhaps the phage system T4 deoxynucleotide kinases played a role in their alternate evolutionary origins. Another family member of this H-group, the ATPase P4 from bacteriophage phi12 [NTPase_P4, Fig. 2(D) ] contains motor proteins involved in the packaging of Pseudomonas phage phi-12 genome into preformed capsids using ATP to drive translocation. 17 The central P4 structure core, together with part of the Cterminal region, forms a Rossmann-type domain containing a twisted, eight-stranded b-sheet of mixed parallel and antiparallel topology flanked by five helices. Although the P4 family is limited to phage proteins, their presumed homologous relationship to other P-loop structures suggests common evolutionary origin. 18 The toprim-like [Toprim_2, Fig. 2 (G)] family belongs to \"HAD domain-related\" homology group [2006.1, Fig. 2 (E-G)] and is represented by DNA primase-helicase proteins. 19 Phage T7 encodes DNA polymerase, primase, helicase, and single-stranded DNA binding activities that catalyze the replication of double-stranded phage DNA. Primase and helicase activities reside in a bifunctional primase-helicase protein that assembles into ring-shaped hexamers. 20 Given their essential role in phage replication, these viral toprim-like proteins are predominantly found in bacteriophages and nucleocytoplasmic large DNA viruses. 21 Two possible evolutionary scenarios have been proposed for primase-helicase proteins. The first involves fusion of primase and helicase genes, while the second considers the primase-helicase gene as an ancestor that underwent duplication and divergence followed by physical separation of primase and helicase functions.",

            "text": "The phage tail sheath protein domain [Phage_-sheath_1, Fig. 2 (H)] with the following common sheet topology (231456) contains proteins that play crucial roles in contracting the tail of bacteriophage T4 through the host outer membrane during infection. 22 The phage tail sheath protein resembles the fold of the Type VI secretion system protein (T6SS) VipA/VipB heterodimer that intertwines to adopt the Rossmann-like architecture. 23 In fact, components of the T6SS system, which delivers effector proteins into a target cell, and the phage tail-associated complex are thought to have arisen from a common ancestor. 24 The T4-glucosyltransferase family [ Fig. 2 (K)], limited to phage proteins, catalyzes the transfer of glucose from uridine diphosphoglucose to 5hydroxymethyl cytosine. The role of glycosylation in protecting the infecting viral DNA from host restriction enzymes has been reviewed. 25 Comparison of the glucosyltransferase family fold to other families showed that it is completely embedded in the structure of glycogen phosphorylase. All nine a-helices and 13 b-strands of b-glucosyltransferase match elements of glycogen phosphorylase in sequential order. 26 The significance of the match is further supported by the fact that the first and second domains of the common core are architecturally distinct despite topographical similarity to the classical nucleotide-binding fold. It appears paradoxical that the architecture of T4 b-glucosyltransferase is simpler and therefore appears more primitive than that of glycogen phosphorylase, which is the older enzyme by phylogenetic arguments. 26 The paradox may be resolved by either of two evolutionary models that differ in the point of divergence between glycogen phosphorylase and T4 bglucosyltransferase. The first model postulates that the gene for T4 b-glucosyltransferase diverged rather recently from a fully evolved glycogen phosphorylase and evolution in T4 rapidly simplified the structure of the protein down to the essential catalytic core. In the second model, both descend along separate lineages from a very ancient common ancestor.",

The core of these domains is formed by a twisted, six-stranded b-sheet flanked by six helices. b-strands 4 and 5 are antiparallel, which makes the catalytic domain unique among the known Listeria phage endolysins. 27 Based on their antimicrobial properties, endolysins from phages infecting Grampositive pathogens have recently attracted attention as potential therapeutic agents. 28 Initial studies were successfully carried out with oral Streptococci in mice 29 as well as with Bacillus anthracis in vitro. 30 Also genetically modified lactic acid bacteria that are able to synthesize and secrete active Listeria phage endolysin were constructed to protect food fermentation products. 31 Cutinase [ Fig. 2 (L)] belongs to the a/b-hydrolase H-group and is another big family that contains proteins from different domains of life. Cutinase is a serine esterase with the classical Ser, His, Asp triad of serine hydrolases. The structure of a cutinase shows an a/b sandwich organization similar to lysin B (LysB) enzymes. Viral LysB proteins are produced by mycobacteriophages to degrade the host peptidoglycan layer. The activity also circumvents a mycolic acid-rich outer membrane covalently attached to the arabinogalactan-peptidoglycan complex in the wall of Mycobacterium. 32 The five closest related structures of LysB are all cutinases, although there is no greater than 21% amino acid sequence identity with any of them. The LysB catalytic mechanism is expected to be similar to that for other serine esterases. Acquisition of LysB by mycobacteriophages throughout their evolution likely confers a substantial selective advantage over those without it by providing faster and more complete lysis. 32 ",

            "text": "Like the bacterial and eukaryotic branches in the tree of life, the Archea are host to a multitude of Functional and Evolutionary Analysis of Viral Proteins viruses. However, compared to viruses infecting the domains Eukaryota and Bacteria, studies of viruses infecting the Archea are still in their infancy. 33 The PDB database includes 305 domains in 55 structures of archeal-specific viral nonchimeric proteins and only three domains in three structures were defined as Rossmann-like (Fig. 3 ). In addition to these archea-specific viruses, all types of dsDNA viruses known to infect bacteria can replicate in archea, including head-tailed viruses (families Myoviridae, Siphoviridae, and Podoviridae), icosahedral viruses with internal lipid envelopes (families Sphaerolipoviridae and Turriviridae in archea; Tectiviridae and Corticoviridae in bacteria), and pleomorphic viruses (families Pleolipoviridae in archea and Plasmaviridae in bacteria). 34 One example of an archealinfecting viral protein is the B116 protein (DUF1874 family) of Sulfolobus turreted icosahedral virus (STIV). 35 While the 37 STIV open reading frames (ORFs) generally lack sequence similarity to other genes ORF B116 is common to the genomes of three additional hyperthermophilic Archeal viral families, the Rudiviridae, the Lipothrixviridae and the Bicaudaviridae. The B116 polypeptide folds to form a fivestranded, predominantly parallel b-sheet (topology 31452) lined on one side by three a-helices, with strand b5 running antiparallel to the remaining strands. Interestingly, an intramolecular disulfide bond, contributed by Cys33 and Cys62, is also observed. This covalent link between the a1 and a2 helices is likely to enhance the thermostability of the B116 fold. Two copies of the B116 polypeptide are found in the asymmetric unit, giving rise to the homodimer and forming a larger 10-stranded unclosed barrel, giving rise to a saddle shaped protein. Authors suggested that this unclosed barrel could be a place of nonspecific DNA binding in which the Rossmann-like fold also could take part. 35 One more example from STIV is the A197 protein (EUF08621 family). The structure of the A197 monomer reveals a six-stranded, predominantly parallel, a/b/a sandwich that is flanked by a fourstranded antiparallel b-sheet with an extended C terminus. Structure similarity data identified members of the glycosyltransferase (GT-A) superfamily as the closest structural homologues of this protein. A197 is one of the smallest known glycosyltransferases, composed of only the core catalytic GT-A fold and lacking additional functional domains. Thus, its structure may define the minimal components necessary for glycosyltransferase activity. 36 The third example is the B204 protein (AAA_22_like family). It is an ATPase belonging to the P-loop containing nucleoside triphosphate hydrolases H-group that is thought to drive packaging of viral DNA during the replication process. The structure of STIV B204 is represented by a central nine-stranded b-sheet decorated with seven a-helices. B204 contains a core Rossmann-like fold (sheet topology 32451) followed by a b-meander with a helical hairpin stemming from one of the loops. Related P-loop ATPases with this identical topology also function to translocate DNA; including the bacterial conjugation protein TrwB that transfers bacterial DNA across membranes and between cells 37 and the VirB4 ATPase of the bacterial type IV secretion system that mediates the transfer of proteins and DNA across bacterial membranes. 38 ",

            "text": "In contrast to bacteria and archea, eukaryota hosts numerous, diverse RNA viruses, retrotranscribing elements and retroviruses that typically integrate into the host genome. 39 The giant viruses of the family Mimiviridae are associated with a distinct class of satellite viruses, the virophages, which reproduce within viral \"factories\" inside their host protist cells and which depend on the latter for their replication. 40 In our dataset Mimiviridae encodes two protein families. The glucose-methanol-choline oxidoreductase family, represented by the R135 protein, contains an Nterminal FAD binding Rossmann-related domain followed by a C-terminal substrate recognition domain. The R135 oxidoreductase might participate in degrading the cell walls of their normal hosts, which include some lignin-containing algae. 41 The minimal Rossmann domain is composed of a five-stranded parallel b-sheet with the same b-strand topology typical of a nucleotide-binding fold. The second Mimiviridae protein family is represented by tyrosyl tRNA synthetases (TyrRS). These proteins have sixstranded b-sheet topology ordered 432561, with an antiparallel first strand. TyrRS shares 30% identity over 340 residues with the TyrRS of the hyperthermophilic Euryarchaeota Pyrococcus horikoshii, its closest known structural homologue. tRNA synthetases are pivotal in determining how the genetic code is translated in amino acids and in providing the substrate for protein synthesis. The discovery of four aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases encoded in the genome of mimivirus together with a full set of translation initiation, elongation, and termination factors appeared to blur what was once a clear frontier between the cellular and viral world. 42 Another eukaryotic infecting virus, vaccinia virus (Poxviridae), causes smallpox. The Poxviridae genome includes eight protein family groups with five different topology types. One of example is H3 envelop protein-an immunodominant antigen that is expressed late in infection and found as a membrane protein on the surface of virion particles. The nine-stranded b-sheet is made up of strands in the order 679584132 that is surrounded with helices on both sides, and all of the strands except 7 and 8 are oriented parallel to each other. The fold belongs to glycosyltransferases (GTs) of the GT-A group. 43 H3 is involved in attachment to the host cell, contributes to viral morphogenesis, and plays a role in infection. 44 Since H3 is a major immune system target that is recognized by neutralizing antibodies, H3 is an important viral protein to be included in new vaccines. 45 Another example is subunit D12 of vaccinia virus capping enzyme that executes all three steps in m7GpppRNA synthesis. 46 The topology of the stimulatory subunit D12 reveals a class I N7methyl-transferase (MT) like core, however, with a truncated S-adenosyl-homocysteine-binding domain, consistent with its lack of MT activity. This enzyme has a completely unique mode of binding of the adenosine moiety of S-adenosyl-homocysteine, a feature that could be exploited for design of specific antipoxviral compound. 47 Zika virus (Flaviviridae) include only one family with a minimal Rossmann structure, non-structural protein NS1. The protein fold and domain arrangement of NS1 is virtually identical to dengue virus DENV2 protein and West Nile virus NS1 protein.",

The Zika virus, which has been implicated in an increase in neonatal microcephaly and Guillain-Barr e syndrome, has spread rapidly through tropical regions of the world. NS1 plays crucial role in the Zika virus life cycle, being a multifunctional virulence factor. 48 Reoviridae is a big viral family infecting fish, shellfish, crustacean species, insects, ruminants and human hosts. The Reoviridae family includes structure representatives from nine different protein families. Rotaviruses are the principal agents of infectious dehydrating diarrhea of infants and the cause of nearly a half-million childhood deaths per year. 49 They have a segmented, double stranded RNA (dsRNA) genome, packaged within a multishelled virus particle. The outer protein layer of the virion, the molecular machinery for host-cell binding and penetration, contains two protein components, VP4 and VP7. 50 The domain containing minimal Rossmann motif of VP7 protein has five parallel bstrands and is assigned to \"Flavodoxin-like\" possible homology group. Rotavirus infection and parenteral immunization with virions both induce a strong VP7-specific neutralizing antibody response. This protein is a principal target of protective antibodies. 51",

Looking at the similarity of the Rossmann motif ECOD families' sequences to those in the nonredundant sequence database, all Rossmann-like fold families were divided into six groups according to appearance of BLAST hits from four taxonomy groups: A-Archea, B-Bacteria, E-Eukaryota and V-Viruses. The first group -31% (25 out of 81) of all protein families under study has universal BLAST hits from archea, Bacteria, Eukaryota and Viruses (\"ABEV\", see two last columns at the online table: http://prodata. swmed.edu/rossmann_fold/viruses/). Half (13 out of 25, or 52%) of these families belong to doublestranded DNA viruses (dsDNA), which can affect bacteria.

The second half of protein families with \"ABEV\" hits (12 out of 25, or 48%) belong to viruses that affect eukaryotes, including doublestranded DNA and positive single-stranded RNA ((1)ssRNA) viruses.

            "text": "Given the relatively high number of viral protein families that contain a Rossmann-like fold (81 families), we sought to examine their evolutionary distributions among folds from the three major host kingdoms. Figure 4 highlights the protein family counts from bacteria (blue bar), archea (red bar), and eukaryota (green bar)-infecting viruses that fall within all distinct minimum Rossmann fold types. Importantly, each fold type includes protein families related by a common ancestor (ECOD Hgroup). The fold types represented by more than one host kingdom tend to display relatively high family counts. These well-populated folds include P-loop domains-related (2004.1), Rossmann-related (2003.1), and UDP-glycosyltransferase/glycogen phosphorylase (2111.1). Most of the other fold types include only one family representative, with 8 from eukaryotic hosts, 6 from bacterial hosts, and one from archeal hosts. The fold type nucleotidediphospho-sugar transferases (2111.6) contains two families from eukaryote and one from archea, while the fold type SGNH hydrolase (2007.5) contains one family from bacteria and one from archea. This almost biphasic distribution, with one wellpopulated universal fold set and one less populated unique fold set, suggests that despite the fundamental differences in the viriomes from the three domains of cellular life, they survive using a common set of folds. Furthermore, these well-populated folds extend across all life forms, perhaps suggesting an ancient origin. Accordingly, the P-loop domainslike fold, whose nucleotide metabolic enzyme components are thought to form the origin of the protein world, 52 also represent the most populated fold among viral genomes. Such examples of ancient viral proteins should be useful for understanding evolutionary relationships among members of this unique domain of life. Alternately, the unique fold types likely drive some of the differences observed in virus infecting different cellular forms of life. For example, the cystovirus bacteriophage phi12 encodes a unique P7 protein with a minimal Rossmann fold. Phi12 P7 is classified as its own unique X-group in ECOD, implying a lack of evidence for homology to existing folds. P7 serves as a putative virion assembly cofactor thought to bind the unique threesegmented double-stranded cystovirus RNA genome. 53 The avian coronavirus that infects chickens encodes another example (IBV Nsp2a) of a unique Rossmann-like fold domain. The N-terminal domain of Nsp2a adopts a Rossmann-like sheet topology (2314), with b-strand 2 being an insert to the core that is antiparallel to the rest. Although the function of Nsp2a is unknown, its lack of sequence/ structure similarity to other proteins has suggested a role in host specificity. 54 ",

These motifs have helped classify P-loop helicases into superfamilies (SF1-SF5) based on sequence, with the last family including also nonhelicase NTPases. 58 Modular accessory domains or subdomains, including terminal extensions and insertions within the core, can also regulate helicase activity. 58 By shuffling core and regulatory domains, nature has created a diverse range of cellular helicase machinery that also plays key roles in viral function. As such, the relative abundance of helicases in viral genomes has been used in part to assess picornaviral evolution. 59 Their key roles in viral function also suggest helicases as novel targets for treating viral infections. 58 In humans, several debilitating inherited disorders are linked to genetic defects in helicase genes, including Bloom's, Werner's, and Rothmund-Thomson's syndromes. 60 The potential of helicases as antiviral drug targets has recently been reviewed. 61 Among viral protein structures containing the minimal Rossmann fold, 14 protein families are known helicases (http://prodata.swmed.edu/ross-mann_fold/viruses/). Helicase domains fall into two different homologs folds (H-groups): P-loop domainsrelated (13 families) and HAD domain-related (1 family). 19 Given the number of P-loop domainsrelated representatives and their potential for informing viral evolution, we constructed a structure-based tree of domains that contain P-loop Figure 5 .

Nodes of the tree are labeled by PDB and colored according to superfamily. Structures are colored in rainbow according to the core Rossmann-like topology common to all viral helicase domains.

            "text": "Looking at similarity to known protein sequences, about one third of the Rossmann motif ECOD families are limited to viral sequences (27 out of 81, or 33%). Most of these viral-specific protein families exhibit characteristics of fast evolution, with their sequences being distinct from homologs (24 out of 27, or 89%). Interestingly, most of these fast evolving families infect eukaryotes (21 out of 24, or 87%), with many of these classified as diverse methyltransferase domains (12 families). Viral methyltransferase domains tend to function in mRNA 5' cap biosynthesis. One viral methyltransferase example that has not rapidly diverged from its FtsJ counterparts in other kingdoms (i.e., \"ABVE\") illustrates a typical methyltransferase fold bound to AdoMet substrate and cap [ Fig. 6(A) ]. Alternately, a fast evolving structure of the vaccinia virus protein VP39 highlights the typical methyltransferase binding sites for AdoMet substrate [ Fig. 6(B) , black stick] with diversity arising from extensions at the termini, a replacement of the C-terminal helix with a strand, and a unique cap binding pocket [ Fig. 6(B) , magenta stick] that allows for sensing substrate methylation status. 62 Evolution of viral methyltransferases has been discussed, with the unique sequence features arising from their invention of alternate capping pathways, their intimate interactions with additional viral enzymes functioning in the process, and their inactivation as methyltransferases. 63 Such inactive domains have transformed into RNA-binding modules 64 Fig. 6(D,E) , respectively]. Interestingly, classified viral methyltransferase domains from SARS NSP15 and PRRSV NSP11 endoribonucleases have a largely degraded Nterminus where AdoMet substrate usually binds; however, the distinguishing C-terminal b-hairpin that marks the methyltransferase fold remains intact [ Fig. 6(F) ]. The function of this domain, like other viral structure additions, appears to be in oligomerization. Given the uniqueness of the folds with respect to host methyltransferases, the rapidly diverging viral methyltransferases might serve as targets for therapy. Indeed, Zika virus NSP5, which includes an FtsJ family methyltransferase domain, shows promise for drug design. 66 Alternatively, to the majority of fast evolving viral Rossmann domains, only a few of them (3 out of 27, or 11%) appear as being unique to virus. These belong to virus with diverse hosts, with one infecting bacteria (Pseudomonas phage core protein P7) and two infecting eukaryotic hosts (IBV Nsp2a and Zika virus NS1). The IBV Nsp2a N-terminus contains a minimal Rossmann-like motif with an a/b insertion following the first helix that forms an antiparallel interaction with the crossover strand 2 [ Fig.  7(A) ]. While NSP2 is one of the first proteins to be translated and processed in the IBV life cycle, its function remains unknown. Zika virus NS1 also adopts a minimal Rossmann-like fold. However, NS1 replaces the C-terminal helix addition with an Nterminal helix addition. It also has an insertion in the same position as Nsp2a, but the b-strand forms a parallel interaction with strand 2 [ Fig. 7(B) ]. The function of Zika virus NS1 remains unclear. The unique properties of these apparent viral-specific proteins, which could have arisen from degradation of more complete Rossmann domains, preclude functional inference from their structure.",

This family has emerged from studies of phages, prophages, and transposons from predominantly Grampositive bacteria and consists of three groups. The structural and evolutionary differences imply that an ancestral catalytic domain has fused to unrelated sequences to result in a family of structurally and functionally diverse proteins. Thus, the modular nature of the serine recombinases resembles that in other recombination enzymes, such as the tyrosine integrases and the DDE superfamily of transposases. 71 Interestingly, serine recombinases have significant sequence similarity to the poxvirus F16 protein whose function is still unclear, but it is proposed that this protein may affect signaling functions of the nucleoli and it is unlikely to have serine recombinase activity. 72 Thus, the most parsimonious evolutionary scenario of these orthologs involves acquisition of a serine recombinase gene by the ancestor of poxviruses from a transposon or a bacteriophage. 72 ",
