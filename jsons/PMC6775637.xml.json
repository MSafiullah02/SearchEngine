            "text": "Acute lung injury (ALI) is a serious complication of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS). In the setting of SIRS, ALI and its most severe form, the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), carry a mortality rate estimated at up to 40% [1]. Although ARDS occurs following direct lung injury such as pneumonia, up to half of ARDS cases result from indirect inflammatory injury, as might occur in the setting of trauma or sepsis [2]. To date, the primary approach to caring for patients with ARDS is supportive care. Multiple pharmacologic therapies aimed at improving patient outcomes have been unsuccessful, indicating an overall knowledge gap about primary underlying mechanisms. While multiple factors contribute to the development of ALI, oxidative stress caused by or resulting from production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) has been identified as one potential mechanism [3\u20135]. Even so, clinical trials using broad-spectrum antioxidant therapies have not improved outcomes [6], suggesting that the role of oxidants is not well understood.",

            "text": "Though there are many potential sources for ROS production during lung injury, a predominant feature of ARDS is the infiltration of neutrophils to the alveolar space. Neutrophils produce ROS in part through the NADPH oxidase 2 (Nox2), a multi-subunit enzyme complex in leukocytes. Although oxidative stress resulting from ROS production has been proposed as injurious and involved in the pathogenesis of ARDS [4], there is evidence suggesting the contrary. Segal et al. [7] showed increased pulmonary inflammation following direct lung injury in mice lacking functional Nox2. Further, mice that lack Nox2 develop spontaneous arthritis with high levels of pro-inflammatory mediators [8]. These studies suggest that Nox2-derived ROS also have an important role in the downregulation of local inflammatory processes.",

Using a murine model of SIRS, we found that mice lacking the catalytic subunit of Nox2 (gp91phox-/y) had increased early mortality and unresolved inflammation [9]. The primary phenotypic difference in the gp91phox-/y mice was the development of severe lung injury, characterized by hemorrhage, neutrophil infiltration, and thrombus formation, that was not present in WT mice. The early development of lung injury in the gp91phox-/y mice suggests that Nox2 in a resident cell in the lung is protective against the development of ALI during systemic inflammation.",

Although both genotypes demonstrate early signs of systemic inflammation, mice lacking Nox2 rapidly develop lung injury that is not present in the WT mice. Additionally, we provide evidence that this difference is related to baseline differences in chemokine expression by the alveolar macrophage. Overall, our results demonstrate that Nox2 is essential in limiting inflammation in the lung following sterile systemic insults.",

On gross inspection at the time of euthanasia, we noted the development of microthrombi on the surface of the lungs 2 h following intraperitoneal zymosan injection in a significant percentage of gp91phox-/y mice (11/18; 61%), whereas this was not observed in WT mice (0/19; 0%) (Fig. 3). There was a significant increase in the percentage of neutrophils in the lung homogenates 1 and 2 h post injection in both genotypes (Fig. 4a\u2013c), with no significant differences in total lung cell count between genotypes (Fig. 4d). Given that the lung homogenates were obtained following bronchoalveolar lavage and perfusion of the pulmonary vasculature, the neutrophils represent both marginated and interstitial neutrophils. We further examined the phenotype of this subgroup of neutrophils by examining the surface expression of the \u03b22-integrin CD11b (Mac-1). CD11b is a well-described marker of neutrophil priming/activation status and a necessary protein for neutrophil migration [13]. PMNs in the lung homogenate displayed an increase in CD11b expression on the cell surface 2 h after injection in both genotypes, with significantly higher expression in the gp91phox-/y mice compared to the WT mice (Fig. 4e). Thus, even though both genotypes display increased neutrophil sequestration in the lung during systemic inflammation, the increase in CD11b expression 2 h following zymosan injection suggests that neutrophils from the gp91phox-/y mice are more activated when compared to the WT mice. Given this difference, we next examined expression and secretion of inflammatory chemokines in the lung.",

Uninjected gp91phox-/y mice displayed markedly enhanced secretion of MIP-1\u03b1 in the lung compared to WT mice, with a trend towards increased secretion of MCP-1 (Fig. 5e, f). As the lung homogenate contains a mixed cell population, it is difficult to determine which cell type is responsible for the increase in MIP-1\u03b1 secretion.

We demonstrate that PMNs isolated from the lung of gp91phox-/y mice migrate to BAL fluid obtained from the gp91phox-/y mice, whereas there is a lower percentage of WT lung PMNs that migrate to WT BAL fluid (Fig. 9). Since cells have been removed from the BAL fluid, this demonstrates that the chemokine gradient present in the BAL fluid is sufficient to lead to increased neutrophil recruitment to the alveolar space. Considered in combination, these data suggest that Nox2 protects against the development of ALI by modulating chemokine secretion by alveolar macrophages.",

Oxidative stress has been targeted in the past, but these therapies have not been effective in improving patient outcomes. Prior studies in our laboratory have demonstrated that there is an important anti-inflammatory role of Nox2-derived ROS in the lung. In the current study, we significantly expand our understanding of the mechanism by which Nox2-derived ROS serve to protect against ALI in sterile systemic inflammation. Our findings demonstrate that the development of lung injury is not a function of increased systemic inflammation, but rather an organ-specific inflammatory process in the gp91phox-/y mice. The novelty of the current study is the demonstration of enhanced basal gene expression of MIP-1\u03b1, MIP-1\u03b2, and MIP-2 in alveolar macrophages isolated from gp91phox-/y mice, suggesting that Nox2-derived ROS are required for the modulation of inflammatory chemokines in the lung and maintenance of immune homeostasis. While this baseline difference in inflammatory chemokine gene expression in alveolar macrophages in the gp91phox-/y mice does not lead to lung injury in unstimulated mice, it may lead to enhanced susceptibility to systemic inflammatory insults. The requirement for Nox2-derived ROS in repressing the secretion of chemokines in the lung may also partially explain the failure of broad-spectrum antioxidant therapies in ARDS.",

These include models of direct lung injury, such as intratracheal zymosan [7], LPS [7], and acid aspiration [14], and indirect lung injury, such as bacterial peritonitis [15]. In contrast with our findings, Imai et al. [16] demonstrated that mice lacking Nox2 were protected against the development of lung injury using pulmonary instillation of the H5N1 virus, and Menden et al. [17] found that Nox2-deficient mice had attenuated lung injury following intraperitoneal injection with LPS. In the study by Imai et al., mice lacking p47phox, a cytosolic subunit of Nox2, were protected against lung injury as determined by improved lung elastance, decreased pulmonary edema and decreased alveolar wall thickening during H5N1 infection [16]. No comment is made regarding the presence of neutrophil infiltration in the lung or BAL in their model. Patients with mutations in p47phox have a less severe phenotype when compared to patients with mutations in gp91phox due to residual ROS production [18], which may, in part, explain the attenuated lung injury in their study. Menden et al. [17] used intraperitoneal injection of LPS in neonatal mice and demonstrated attenuated neutrophil infiltration to the lung in Nox2-deficient mice. There are two key differences in this study when compared to our model of sterile systemic inflammation. First, this study utilized neonatal mice, which, in addition to having underdeveloped lungs, have been demonstrated to have an immature innate immune system [19]. Second, mice and humans are known to have different sensitivities to LPS, and therefore, this model may not be directly applicable to human disease. Interestingly, the study by Menden et al. was also in contrast to the study by Gao et al. [15], which used Escherichia coli peritonitis as their model. As LPS and E. coli both produce inflammation through Toll-like receptor 4, the mechanism behind the difference in responses in the two studies is unclear.",

Our data demonstrate that neutrophil sequestration occurs in both genotypes as early as 1 h following induction of sterile inflammation. This increase in neutrophil sequestration in the lung is consistent with prior studies using mice lacking Nox2 with induced bacterial peritonitis [15]. The accumulation of neutrophils in the pulmonary vascular bed has been previously demonstrated and may be beneficial in allowing for rapid response to infection or injury. In patients who develop ARDS, neutrophil sequestration in the pulmonary capillaries has been shown to be one of the earliest events [26], with the large number of neutrophils remaining in the pulmonary vascular bed resulting in a reduction in the peripheral neutrophil count [27, 28]. Although neutrophil sequestration is recognized as an early event in the development of ALI, the activation status of these neutrophils likely determines the extent of their extravascular migration and the degree of host damage. Consistent with previous studies in our laboratory [12], there was higher expression of CD11b on the surface of neutrophils sequestered in the lung in gp91phox-/y mice when compared to WT mice 2 h following zymosan injection. This difference in activation status may be a factor in the differential neutrophil migration to the alveolar space in gp91phox-/y mice despite the increase in neutrophil sequestration in both genotypes.",

Park et al. [49] demonstrated a requirement for ERK and JNK for the expression of MIP-1\u03b1 and MCP-1 in response to LPS using cultured murine macrophages. STAT3 is recognized to play a key role in regulating inflammatory processes [50, 51] and is activated primarily through the Janus kinase (JAK) family of kinases via tyrosine phosphorylation [52]. Inhibition of the Jak2-STAT3 pathway blocked the upregulation of MIP-1\u03b1 6 h following LPS treatment in cultured murine macrophages [53].

The finding of a basal increase in the expression of MIP-1\u03b1, MCP-1, and MIP-2 in vivo as well as MIP-1\u03b2 ex vivo in alveolar macrophages isolated from the gp91phox-/y mice suggests that Nox2 modulates the production of chemokines by alveolar macrophages, thereby regulating neutrophil infiltration in the lung under inflammatory conditions. Enhanced basal secretion of these inflammatory chemokines in the gp91phox-/y mice, while insufficient to cause significant lung injury under resting conditions, may make the lungs more susceptible to inflammation following an acute inflammatory stimulus. The interaction between activated circulating neutrophils and increased secretion of inflammatory chemokines from the alveolar macrophage leads to neutrophil infiltration in the alveolar space in gp91phox-/y mice. Strategies aimed at regulating chemokine production in the lung may be a future target for reducing lung injury-associated morbidity in the setting of systemic inflammation.",
