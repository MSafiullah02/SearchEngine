RSV-A ARI cases from 2010\u20132011 seasons were bundled into NA1 whereas RSV-A from 2012 season formed distinct cluster within ON1 genotype (Fig. S1).

This study is the first report regarding the emergence of ON1 in Vietnam. In our study site, NA1 was circulating as the only RSV-A genotype in 2010 and 2011 seasons (Table 3). However, ON1 emerged in mid-2012 and became the predominant genotype in 2012 season. The prevalence of ON1 among RSV-A reached nearly 73% in 2012 season whereas proportion of NA1 decreased down to about 23% from 100% in both 2010 and 2011 season (Table 3). ON1 genotype emerged and was detected as major genotype during 2011\u20132012 seasons in countries such as Cyprus, Italy, Germany and Philippine293031343536. However, further studies are required to monitor whether ON1 persisted as the predominant genotype after its emergence in these countries.

One study from Italy, Pierangeli et al. also found that ON1 cases were seen in slightly younger age group30, while other studies did not find significant differences3136.

Furthermore, significantly shorter mean period from disease onset to the hospital admission (in day) was seen in ON1 ARI cases (1.7, ON1 vs 2.7, NA1, p < 0.001). Although the detailed biological mechanism has not been clearly understood, the G-protein 72-nucleotide tandem duplication of ON1 might have crucial biological role by enhancing the efficiency for viral attachment to the cell receptors or faster viral replication capacity during pathogenesis. Further studies are necessary to clarify the biological significance of the 72-nucleotide insertion in the G-protein.",

Furthermore, we did not take into account the co-infection with respiratory bacterial pathogens. In fact, it has been previously reported that RSV may increase the Streptococcus pneumoniae bacterial load which was associated with increased risk of radiologically-confirmed pneumonia4344.

Clinical-epidemiological information, chest radiographs result (Chest X-ray), laboratory test data and nasopharyngeal (NP) swab samples were collected from all the participants.
