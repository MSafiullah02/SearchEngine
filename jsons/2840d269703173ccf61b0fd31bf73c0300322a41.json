A conglomerate or a company group is a cluster containing companies with shared financial interests or representing the same center of interest or power. Conglomerates can be extremely small, counting from two up to a few tens of companies, or very large, with hundreds or thousands of entities. When crisis strikes, the presence of groups is a further chance for companies to survive, thanks to the resilience deriving from geographical differentiation, diversification of economic activities, improved risk sharing, and so on. Yet, lockdown alters mutual influence between companies and undermines the structure of conglomerates; sometimes companies are even legally impeded from paying their dividends. Similarly, control relationships and actual decision centers become hard to individuate. Not to mention that the topology of the network can change relatively quickly over time, with small mutations possibly yielding large cascade effects, on which a swift and total re-assessment is to be made.",

They are specific entities (e.g., in the energy, military, transport fields, etc.) that are considered of national relevance and must therefore be carefully protected in terms of shareholding structure, so they remain publicly held, i.e., with the State controlling the majority of the shares. It turns out that in crises, taking advantage of market turbulence, specific players are inclined to pursuing takeovers and affect the public control over such companies. This theme has received prominent attention with the COVID-19 outbreak and is especially relevant in the Italian case. Many countries have developed legal frameworks to protect strategic companies by vetoing specific share acquisition operations, which are likely to hide a takeover attempt. Yet, the problem of detecting when a specific transaction underlies a takeover is by no means trivial and involves a global approach which considers at least the entire national company graph.",

Logic-based languages for Knowledge Representation and Reasoning are a largely adopted tool, enjoying recently increased popularity thanks to the rise of mature formalisms. They strike a good balance between expressive power and computational complexity, in the sense that they are sufficiently articulated to be able to represent real-world problems and simple enough to be efficiently processed by automated reasoning systems for Knowledge Graphs (Knowledge Graph Management Systems -KGMS).

In this respect, recent literature [6, 17, 31] shows that concentrated corporate ownership is very common in industrialised countries, where a few subjects (or groups thereof) exert control over a range of firms and favour the formation of conglomerates, i.e., company groups revolving around a single center of interest or decision. In this context, convoluted and sometimes impenetrable ownership structures are being more and more used as a tool to separate corporate ownership, which pertains to share possession and hence to dividend flows, from control, which is the ability to push decisions through in the company and is related to voting power [3, 18] .",

They must distribute and mitigate default, credit, and operational risks, by means of a proper balancing of their shareholding structure. So, we ask: What are the dynamics induced by emergency restrictions on networks of companies? How are these networks going to adapt as (and if) conditions get stricter or more lenient over time?

            "text": "Strategic Companies. Companies are key to the resilience of a state as a whole and it is essential that the ownership of -or, more importantly, the decision power upon -companies deemed of strategic relevance (e.g., in the energy, military, transport, telecommunications sectors) remains inside the national borders. Conversely, it is often the case that companies stretched by massive shut downs like those of COVID times (and production plunge in general) are subject to attempts of foreign takeovers, with buyers trying to take advantage of lowered share prices due to market uncertainty. Different countries have classically resorted to legal frameworks to protect strategic companies against foreign takeovers [30] . Italy is a relevant example: Being one of the most stricken countries, in the COVID emergency, it carried out a careful application of the so-called Golden Powers [35] , that is the possibility of the central Government to veto specific acquisition transactions (e.g., in terms of shares of stocks), that would cause strategic firms to be subject to foreign takeover. Likewise, the Government can intervene to secure companies by acquiring or increasing its participation (technically, investment beef-up) via publicly controlled intermediaries on the strategic firms. Unfortunately, an effective application of the mentioned legal frameworks and Golden Powers in particular is by no means trivial. How can we tell whether a transaction is a takeover attempt? Will a transaction actually allow a takeover? What is the minimum amount of share that must shift to public control in order to protect a company? And, how to protect against coordinated, collusive, transactions aiming at a takeover? Also, the transaction alone is not enough. In this game the corporate structure is essential: It can be either intrinsically prone to takeovers, for example if there are firms acting as single points of attack so that gaining control over them immediately allows for many takeovers, or resilient, for example if the control is reasonably shared amongst multiple actors.",

One tool from the Artificial Intelligence (AI) toolbox that is particularly effective to perform reasoning tasks on domains characterized by many entities highly interconnected with one another is Knowledge Graphs (KG). Although there is no agreement on a single definition [16] , KGs can be seen as semi-structured data models, able to represent knowledge about domains of interest in the form of extensional facts -nodes and edges along with their properties -and intensional knowledge, expressed in some formalism, for example logical rules. Intensional knowledge is then activated on the extensional facts in the so-called reasoning process so as to generate new knowledge in the form of new nodes and new edges [7] . 4 In simpler terms, not only do KGs offer an effective representation of highly interconnected data, but these representations are also semantic, meaning that they allow algorithms to simulate a form of human cognition on top of the modeled objects, i.e., to perform Automated Reasoning (AR), typically seen as the ideal complement to machine learning within the vast field of AI [8, 15] .",

A KGMS (Figure 1 ) performs complex rule-based reasoning tasks over very large amounts of data and provides methods and tools for data analytics and machine learning [8] . A KG can be viewed as a semistructured data model for the representation of domains of interest as facts, relationships, and attributes for those facts and relationships. Facts and relationships can be either explicit, i.e., directly available in the enterprise data stores (relational databases, graph databases, NoSQL stores, RDF stores, OLAP systems, etc.) or implicit, in the sense that they are generated when needed as the result of a reasoning task [7] . Modern reasoning tasks embody both deductive and inductive aspects in that they produce conclusions out of given axiomatic premises or ontological descriptions of the reality, but also learn, enrich and improve these descriptions by means of empiric evidence in data, typical in pure machine learning approaches.",

Company graphs are helpful in many situations, for instance to compute the overall ownership a company retains of another, the control relationships, collusion phenomena, etc. Central banks deal with data about companies to pursue core institutional goals in many relevant areas such as banking supervision, credit-worthiness evaluation, anti-money laundering, insurance fraud detection, economic and statistical research, and many more. In particular, the Bank of Italy owns the database of Italian companies provided by the Italian Chambers of Commerce.

Rule (2) is then the basic extension rule, asserting that whenever two companies x and y are close enough (more than ), there exists a conglomerate z to which both belong. The third-party case is captured by Rule (3), where the existence of a company z close to a and b implies that they belong to the same conglomerate z. Rules (4) (5) are consistency rules, to guarantee that each company belongs to exactly one conglomerate. Figure 7 shows a sample -conglomerate extracted from the Italian graph by posing > 0.5. Such threshold captures a sort of share majority: A company within a certain conglomerate acts as an attractor for another company if it holds the majority of the shares (or vice versa, given that V G is symmetric). The lower the threshold, the lower the conglomerate cohesion will be, with larger conglomerates including many loosely connected companies. Conversely, the higher the threshold, the more cohesive the conglomerate will be and involve companies with higher mutual integrated ownership. In the figure, edges with share greater than 0.5 show cases where two nodes are close (Definition 6(i)), such as 3-9 and 3-5; pairs of nodes whose share majority is held by the same third party are close as well (Definition 6(ii)), for instance companies 9 and 5 are both fully owned by 3 and so are close.

In particular, we decomposed each graph into its constituent conglomerates. For this, we set = 0.5 in order to identify conglomerates where there is a strong majority influence between the involved companies (i.e., control is likely to hold) and excluded trivial conglomerates with just one company.

For example, a study of the regional differences in Austria w.r.t. economic vulnerability has been conducted [4] . They adopt the European National Classification of Economic Activities (NACE code) and evaluate impact on a five-level scale. Unlike our work, they do not take into consideration the network dimension in the analysis. As a further difference, we do not aim at analyzing the impact on economic terms, but provide Knowledge Graphs, with a set of standard and advanced descriptive indicators, so as to complement and favor economic analyses. We adopt the Italian hierarchical classification of economic activities (called ATECO, last updated in 2007) issued by the Italian National Statistical Office [29] .",

These works do not adopt a reasoning or algorithmic approach, but tend to privilege a matrix-based formulation, which often exhibits non-trivial computational limitations. Moreover, they often rely on sampling strategies. Our reasoningbased approach for the calculation of relevant indicators overcomes computational problems thanks to the adoption of a tractable (i.e., polynomial time) language for Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KRR) and at the same time leverages the Italian company network.",

In particular, our novel formalization of integrated ownership allows to unambiguously define a company conglomerate and therefore study its properties; similarly, leveraging company control, we formulated a set of problems encoding the scenarios that arise in the protection of strategic companies from takeovers.",
