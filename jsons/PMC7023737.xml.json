Fluid administration is widely accepted as the first-line therapy followed by vasopressor use in persistently hypotensive patients or in those in whom arterial pressure is judged to be insufficient to ensure an adequate tissue perfusion [2]. Studies on implementation of therapeutic bundles in sepsis [3, 4] and recent randomized controlled trials on early goal-directed therapy in septic shock [5\u20137] highlighted the importance of the initial fluid loading and turned this into a standard for the clinical practice. Indeed, current guidelines on sepsis management emphasize on the administration of at least 30 mL/kg of IV crystalloids within the first 3 h of identification of sepsis-induced hypoperfusion, but a recommendation on the timing to start vasopressor support was not clearly stated [1]. Nevertheless, a recent update on the last recommendations of Surviving Sepsis Campaign claims for an immediate start of resuscitation and treatment in a \u201c1-h bundle\u201d [8] including the use of vasopressors in the case of life-threatening hypotension, during or after fluid resuscitation to maintain a MAP \u2265 65 mmHg. Although this initiative embraces the concept of sepsis as a medical emergency, the level of evidence for these recommendations [8] is quite limited and remains debatable.",

In line with this, recent experimental data suggested that fluid resuscitation preceding the start of vasopressors is associated with higher lactate levels and a paradoxical increase in vasopressor requirements when compared with an immediate start of vasopressor therapy without previous fluid administration [11]. Likewise, a number of observational studies suggest that the volume of resuscitation fluids and net fluid balance is associated with mortality in sepsis [12\u201324]. Nevertheless, other data indicates that vasopressors should be administered in combination with fluids since isolated vasopressors can improve arterial pressure but not regional blood flow [25].",

First, norepinephrine may increase cardiac output by increasing stressed volume [26], by improving myocardial contractility [27], and through other various mechanisms [28]. Second, norepinephrine might increase microcirculatory perfusion in septic shock [29\u201331], especially when the baseline microcirculatory blood flow is abnormal [32]. Third, early use of norepinephrine may improve the regional distribution of blood flow and prevent fluid overload [25]. Finally, delays in correcting hypotension are associated with increased risk of death in septic patients [33\u201335], whereby prompt correction of hypotension might influence clinical outcomes. Indeed, a recent phase II randomized controlled trial suggested that early use of norepinephrine might improve the possibility to achieve more sustained mean arterial pressure levels and adequate tissue perfusion parameters [36]. However, this trial was limited by a specificity of the protocol requesting administration of a fixed dose of vasopressors in the early group, which is not the usual way of administering vasopressors.",

Meanwhile, patients with sepsis and vasopressor requirement but without hyperlactatemia were re-classified and analyzed as sepsis-related acute circulatory failure.

Fluid resuscitation was performed administering repeated fluid challenges with crystalloids and/or albumin 4%, using the central venous pressure (CVP) as a dynamic safety limit during fluid loads in patients with a central line in place. Hydroxyethyl starches (HES) were not used. The usual protocol in our institution includes the use of pulse pressure and stroke volume variations to guide fluid resuscitation (when usable). Additionally, echocardiographic determination of velocity-time integral (VTI) before and after passive leg raising (PLR), and end-expiratory occlusion maneuvers were used whenever applicable. The clinical assessment of peripheral perfusion (e.g., measuring capillary refill time [42] and/or the evaluation of mottling score [43]) and the use of advanced monitoring of cardiac output were allowed at the discretion of the attending physician. Norepinephrine was the first-choice vasopressor used to achieve MAP \u2265 65, while vasopressin titrated up to 0.04 UI/min was also allowed to increase MAP or to decrease norepinephrine dose, but never as a single vasopressor. Dobutamine up to 20 \u03bccg/kg min was used in case of myocardial dysfunction, when ScvO2 or lactate goals were not achieved or when clinical signs of hypoperfusion persisted despite adequate fluid resuscitation. Mechanical ventilation was used when indicated, providing light sedation (midazolam or propofol) and analgesia (fentanyl). Red blood cell transfusion was used to maintain hemoglobin levels at or above 7.0 g/dl or > 10.0 g/dl in case of cardiac ischemia. Low-dose hydrocortisone was used when the vasopressor requirement did not decrease during the first 6 h of resuscitation in the presence of an adequate intravascular volume.

Although the lower mortality of patients in which norepinephrine was precociously initiated might have several potential explanations, a more rapid restoration of blood flow in combination with lower fluid accumulation could early restitute tissue perfusion and avoid the harm mediated by fluid overload.

Nevertheless, time elapsed between the first hypotension episode and the introduction of VP support was significantly shortened in the VE-VPs, which is in line with studies suggesting that shorter hypotension times are associated with better outcomes in septic shock [33, 34]. Unfortunately, we recorded blood pressure at discrete intervals, which prevents establishing precisely the number of minutes spent in hypotension in each group.",

Meanwhile, some experimental studies have suggested potential benefits of early combination of vasopressors and fluids on splanchnic blood flow [25]. Due to the nature of our study, it is not possible to discard the concurrence of hypovolemia. Nevertheless, fluid resuscitation in both VE-VPs and D-VPs groups was guided by using fluid responsiveness test and clinical parameters, targeting the restoration of systemic and peripheral perfusion variables. In our study, the intervention consisting of very early use of vasopressors was not associated with an excess of acute kidney injury or increased requirements of acute renal replacement therapies. In addition, most patients initially received vasopressor support through peripheral veins for a few minutes up to a central venous line was obtained, which was not associated with major complications. Finally, although severe digital ischemia cases were not observed, other side effects such as myocardial ischemia were not systematically searched.",

Indeed, fluids were administered based on the same criteria of fluid responsiveness in all patients. In addition, this study is not a probe for the \u201c1-h bundle\u201d recently proposed [8] but rather a hypothesis generator about the benefits of early start of vasopressors in septic shock, emphasizing that patients of the VE-VPs group received the immediate start of norepinephrine without completing a pre-defined volume or resuscitation fluids.",

First, the nature of this study and, therefore, the lack of control by randomization and blinding might limit the validity of conclusions. Admittedly, although propensity scores were constructed incorporating baseline characteristics likely influencing the decision for an early start of VP support, other non-identifiable potential factors might not have been included. In addition, the small sample size introduces a risk of missing important differences at baseline that might contribute to the observed differences in mortality instead of early vasopressor introduction. Second, also due to the nature of our study, it is not possible to establish causal mechanisms leading to differences in clinical outcomes between the groups. Nevertheless, we speculate that the combination of shortening of hypotension time, lower pre-vasopressor and post-vasopressor fluid requirements, and, consequently, lower net fluid accumulation could have influenced clinical outcomes. Third, acute renal failure, acute renal replacement therapies, and digital ischemia were easily tracked. However, other adverse consequences of the early use of vasopressors cannot be ruled out. Fourth, we are not able to identify if the decision of the early start of vasopressors relied on some particular doctors, which could constitute a potential factor of confusion. Finally, although the single-center design might restrict a potential generalization of our results, exclusions were very limited so that this trial reflects the overall spectrum of patients with septic shock. Furthermore, the biological plausibility of these results, the potential physiological mechanisms of early introduction of VPs, and the agreement with recent experimental observations deserve future research efforts.",
