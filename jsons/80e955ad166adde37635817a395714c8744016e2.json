In an open workspace office floor organized in a twohalf structure with shared elevators and restrooms and the employees speaking continuously, the average attack rate over the course of a few days was much higher in one half (78.7% (70.3-85.3%)) than the one for the entire floor (43.5% (37.0-50.1%)).

With an intent to restart the economies, the mitigation measures are being relaxed, despite the fears of a second wave. As the individual desire to go back to \"normal life\" grows stronger, the responsibility of mitigating shifts from the government to the individuals. Although the epidemiologists underscore that one should embrace the \"new-normal\", most of the community neither understands nor appreciates what it is. In the past months since the breakout of the COVID-19 pandemic, everyone has been hearing two things very regularly, a very high number of global infections (which is more than 5 million at this stage) and that one should practice social distancing to mitigate these effects [1] . At times one also hears positive reports about containment from the epidemiologists that the R0, the basic reproduction number that signifies how many new infections can be caused by an infected person, is reducing due to social distancing measures.",

The transmission risks in person-to-person interactions have been graded by the Centers for Disease Control and have served as general guidelines [2]: living in a same household as an intimate partner of a COVID-19 positive patient (high risk), being within 6 feet (or around 2 meters) from a symptomatic laboratory-confirmed person (medium risk), being in the same indoor environments including classrooms, hospital waiting rooms for a prolonged period with no close contact (low risk).",

If an acquaintance is not sneezing or coughing is there a risk in meeting with them in close proximity? Even if one person is infected at a party, if R0 of COVID-19 is around 3 [3], is there a chance of more than 3 new infections? Some of the studies attempted to perform an overall assessment of primary and secondary attack rates [4] or classify the total number of infections by profession [5] , which is very different from the goal we wish to accomplish about the chance of transmitting infections during different daily activities.",

A few contact tracing studies provide a closer look into the contacts, such whether it happened during a meal, at a church or in a household [4] or have detailed the number of infections at different workplaces [5] . However, much of the information publicly known information is available at a 'topological level' in the language of graph theory, meaning person A infected person B after a \"contact\".

Among the data analysed, if one gathers the number of infections caused by different people in a given instance, the median of these numbers results to be 2.5, (Supplementary Table 9 ) as expected from the basic reproduction rate (R0) of COVID-19 [3] . With this validation, we examine the curated data for the superspreaders. Super-spreaders is a qualitative term, and in this work we consider anyone spreading more than 3 (~R0) infections as a super spreader. Among the 44 individuals who caused infections, six super-spreaders could be identified, which curiously fall in two groups -A. Infections on multiple occasions -Patient 31 in South Korea who infected 7 at the Church (S.12A), and 10 others in different occasions and different days (S.12B), Patient A1.1 who attended the funeral in Chicago, who caused 3 infections at the funeral (S.18A), and 7 others at the birthday party 3 days later (S.18B), B. Infections on a single occasion -6 in the Alpine vacation (S.10), 51 Infections caused at the Choir in Washington (S.14), 36 infections caused at the dinner in Safra Jurong (S.6), and 94 infections caused by the two attended 5 night clubs (S.17B). The index patients at the funeral in Chicago, the dinner at Safra Jurong and Choir in Washington had mild respiratory symptoms, and in the other three cases did not have any symptoms when they infected others. In general, various estimates suggest that the infectiousness drops significantly once the symptoms develop [16, 17] . However, there may be exceptions and an individual may continue to spread infection on multiple days. At the same time, any person with a common level of infectiousness and without symptoms can become a super-spreader by having very close interactions with many people or actively mixing in large congregations. There was also a situation of a teacher who attended one of the Itaewon nightclubs (S.17C) in discussion and spread infection to at least 15 individuals, including 6 students. However, the detailed interactions are not known and hence not analyzed.",

            "text": "Role of physical separation. Within the data we analysed, one clearly sees the mixing of the people, coming closer together has a strong influence on the spread of infections, much in line with the general social distancing recommendations. Consider the difference in the attack rate between the family dinners (66.7% (CI48.8-80.8)) and birthday parties which can be imagined to be more personal, with stronger physical interactions compared to the sit-down dinners where the people move around much lesser (15.7% (CI12.1-20.1)) ( Table 1) Transmission in transports and possible role of talking. The only known instance of a family member driving together, and passing on the infection (S.4A) clearly shows that proximity in a closed environment and possible talking play an important role. There could be many reasons behind it such as loud talking or singing which can emit aerosols [33] comparable in amount to coughing as was seen in the spread of tuberculosis [34] and assist the spread of COVID-19 [35] . But such analysis is out of the scope of this work. The present work focused on the known case histories of people interacting with others, either at home or at work, and one common theme among all these interactions is talking, even more than any documented evidences of physical contact through hand-shakes. Thus, by construction the data chosen does not have situations where people did not talk. However, two pieces of data are worth inferring from the study on the South Korean call center. Although the elevators were shared by individuals from all floors, the infections that spread over a few days were confined mainly to floor number 11 (S.2A, S.2E). Secondly, the call center in South Korea is close to two major metro stations, and many employees use these services. There was a chance that the infections could have spread to people sharing the metro services, which is not an easy to track data. However, the first infection in the call center was reported on March 8, and the total number of infections from Seoul in the March 7-March 14 is 139, which leaves at most 42 infections outside the 97 infections related to the call center cluster. Given the numbers of thousands of susceptible people that will be exposed in the metro trains to a significant fraction (considered to be roughly 0.5x97 for the sake of this discussion), 42 infections even if they were all assigned to the call center cluster still suggests a very low attack rate. Thus, the attack rate in the elevators and the metro trains may be considered almost negligible under the conditions the South Koreans usually travel with masks.",

The reasons being that they visited they were in 2, and visited 5 different heavily crowded places, which already is likely to create sufficient new infections. The chance that others who were infected on May 2 early hours, became infectious, and visited the clubs again on May 3 early hours makes it less likely that the 94 infections were caused by individuals other than the two friends.",
