This criterion, therefore, had to be fulfilled for both BP and SCP before the unequivocal assignment of oneway humoral immune cross-reactivity between these two antigens could be made. Two lines of evidence indicate the BP we used was free from SCP. First, bovine brain contains little SCP (Yo and MacPherson, 1972) . This fact, coupled with SCP elution from CM-52 at pH 7.0 with solutions of low ionic strength, ensures that BP prepared from bovine brain by our modification of the Deibler et al. (1978) method contains little, if any, SCP. At the resolution limits of polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, BP so prepared is free from SCP. Second, and more important, early immune and hyperimmune rabbit antisera raised against BP prepared by the modified method did not react with solidphase adsorbed SCP (Tables 1 and 2) or with SCP in solution (Fig. 2B ). Since SCP is highly immunogenic compared to BP, even traces of SCP in the BP preparations used to raise at least the hyperimmune anti-BP serum would have induced concurrent production of a large proportion of anti-SCP antibodies.

First, SCP is routinely prepared by extracting fresh or frozen undefatted bovine spinal cord tissue with 0.1 M NaCI. BP is not extracted under these conditions (Yo and MacPherson, 1972; Weir and MacPherson, 1980) . Second, any BP remaining in the SCP is likely retained on the CM-52 at pH 5.8, when the SCP is eluted with 0.05-0.2 M NaCl. Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of SCP so prepared reveal it to be free of BP (Yo and MacPherson, 1972; MacPherson et al., 1976) . Third, since BP is a poor immunogen compared to SCP, BP contamination of SCP would have to be high to account for the observed proportion of anti-SCP antibodies which bind to solid-phase adsorbed BP (Tables 1 and 2) . Such high BP contamination of our SCP certainly is not the case. Fourth, the data presented in Fig. 2C show that 4Opg of soluble BP are required to effect the same inhibition of anti-SCP antibody binding to solid-phase adsorbed BP caused by 0.6 pg of soluble SCP. In other words, there would have to be 40 pg of BP in the 0.6 pg of SCP antigen to obtain the inhibition caused by this small amount of SCP.

When the indirect immunofluorescence method and an SCP antiserum were used to localize SCP-PN in unfixed or acetone-fixed cryostat sections of bone spinal root, SCP-PN was found in the axons and was clearly absent from myelin (MacPherson and Wallace, 1980) . However, if such cryostat sections are fixed in alcohol (a fixative required for exposure of BP antigenic determinants so that anti-BP antibodies can bind to BP), then the SCP antiserum will stain myelin (MacPherson C. F. C., unpublished observations; Eylar et nl., 1980; Winter ef al., 1982) . We believe that such results arise because the BP crossreactive antibodies in the SCP antisera can bind immunologically to exposed antigenic determinants of BP in alcohol-fixed tissue sections. It thus appears that many immunohistoiogical studies of myelinogenesis in which SCP-PN ( = P2) antiserum has been used in determining the location of this protein in tissues will have to be reassessed in light of the one-way antibody cross-reactivity between SCP and BP. In support of this contention are our immunohistological findings which indicate that one-way antibody cross-reactivity also exists between SCP-PN and the BP found in both the CNS and the peripheral nervous system. A word of caution is necessary here. Because the CNS form of BP must be slightly different antigenically from the peripheral nervous system form of BP (i.e. the latter does not usually induce EAE) and because the CNS form of SCP and SCP-PN may also be slightly different antigenically (i.e. SCP-PN lacks the antiencephalitogenic activity of SCP) means that antibodies against SCP and SCP-PN may cross-react to different degrees with the two forms of BP. Only careful purification of these four proteins, followed by production of polyclonai and monocional antibodies to each and utilization of these antibodies in sensitive immunoassay and immunoprecipitation tests will allow full description of the humoral immune relationships which exist among these four proteins.
