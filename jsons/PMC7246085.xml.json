Individuals with subclinical infections (i.e. who never develop clear symptoms) were assumed to be less infectious than individuals who develop clear symptoms (Fig. 1b indicates, using the SIR model as an example, how \u201casymptomatic carriers\u201d can be included in compartmental models). Data show that interactions vary between individuals of different ages (Fig. 1c), and so Davies et al. [1] divided the UK population of 66.4 million people into 5-year age groups with different infection rates between groups. The number of individuals requiring hospitalisation and the number of deaths in each age group were assumed to be fractions of the total number of cases, with hospitalisation and death being most likely for elderly cases.",

[1], a similar idea applies, but the authors found that short-term implementation of interventions was unlikely to reduce the number of individuals requiring ICU beds below capacity at all times, unless a full \u201clockdown\u201d was introduced. The authors predicted that, in the absence of interventions, 85% (68\u201396%) of individuals in the UK would be infected during the epidemic, and peak ICU bed demand would be between 25 and 80 times higher than standard ICU capacity. If a package of mitigation measures (stopping short of a lockdown, but including school closures, social distancing, shielding of high-risk individuals and self-isolation of symptomatic hosts) was implemented in the model for a period of 12 weeks, then the total number of cases decreased substantially compared to the scenario with no interventions and the peak of the epidemic was delayed by 3\u20138 weeks. However, under these short-term mitigation measures, critical cases were expected to overwhelm healthcare services. Based partly on the results of modelling analyses like that one, a lockdown was introduced in the UK on 23 March 2020, and transmission reduced significantly.",

For example, a strategy of implementing lockdown whenever ICU bed usage increases above 1000 beds, and then removing it whenever bed usage falls below that threshold, leads to a predicted peak bed usage of 5000 (3200\u201339,000).",
