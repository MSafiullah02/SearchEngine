All the epidemic details are factored into a single parameter that is determined by maximizing the rate of entropy production. Despite the simplicity of the final model, it predicts the number of hospitalized cases with a reasonable accuracy, using the data of SARS of the year 2003, once the inflexion point characterizing the effect of multiple controlling efforts is known. This model is supposed to be of potential usefulness since epidemics such as avian influenza like H7H9 in China this year have the risk to become communicable among human beings.",

Up to the end of May 2003 probable cases have been reported in 35 countries or regions, and the cumulative number of cases has reached 8202 by May 26, 2003 according to the report by the World Health Organization (WHO). SARS in the year 2003 and avian influenza like H7N9 this year received or receive intensive attentions from all over the world due to its high case-fatality rate. People were particularly interested in finding the period of the time between infection and the onset of infectiousness, length of period that patients remain infectious, further infections that each patient produce, total number of infections during the epidemic, etc. A large number of publications have been reported for SARS, many of which have been included in reference books [1, 2] and reviews [3, 4] . Important achievements have been made for the transmission dynamics using various mathematical models [5] - [17] and reported data from Hong Kong or Canada. Donnelly et al [5] , Riley et al [6] and Lipsitch et al [7] make use of the available data for SARS on latent, incubation and infectious periods and have successfully fitted their models to data describing the number of cases observed over time. The important conclusion is that if the SARS is uncontrolled, then a majority of people would be infected. The potential effectiveness of different control measures has been studied in these references.",

In fitting \u03c3, the date D (counting from the starting date) and the maximum value H are fixed to be the values given by the reported data (third and fourth columns) so that only \u03c3 is fitted. In the second column, the starting date is approximately the date when the first case was introduced into the region. The outbreak for the epidemic is assumed to take place within at most ten days so the best fit \u03c3 is obtained by using two epidemic starting days (date with the introduction of the first case and latest possible outbreak date). The range of best fit \u03c3 (fifth column) is very close to the theoretical value 0.408 for Beijing and is not significantly different from the theoretical value for the other cities or regions. One would wonder if the use of a value \u03c3 far beyond the theoretical value does not alter the curve significantly. In order to see that, we display in Fig. 11 the role of \u03c3 on the correct reproduction of the curve f = f (t). The log-normal curves using the thermodynamical value \u03c3 = 0.408 and the best fit value \u03c3 = 0.47 are all close to the reported data. However, when \u03c3 is significantly different from the thermodynamical value, then the log-normal curve has a great departure from the reported data, as can be seen from the curves using \u03c3 = 0.1 and \u03c3 = 0.9. This shows that the shape of the curve is quite sensitive to \u03c3 and the theoretical value of \u03c3 is indeed a rational one.",

The model is applied to predict the number for t > L and especially D and f (D) for the 2003 SARS and is hoped to work when the system for SARS or similar epidemic spread involves multiscale interventions and constitutes a thermodynamical system. Despite the possible uncertainty in the reported data for 0 < t < L and that the model does not require epidemic details such as latent, incubation and infectious periods, the comparison between model prediction and reported SARS data is still good enough for the cities or regions where the epidemic is severe. The prediction for the case of Beijing is remarkably well since the number of cases is very large. This shows that when the system is large enough, the thermodynamic approach is more accurate. The actual model has some difficulty to exactly handle the case of multiple inflexion points. The present model can be possibly used to predict epidemics other than SARS once the communicable epidemics receive intensive interventions. The H7N9 avian influenza is actually of great concern [28, 29] and if unluckily this should spread rapidly, we expect the present model would be useful for predicting its spread.",
