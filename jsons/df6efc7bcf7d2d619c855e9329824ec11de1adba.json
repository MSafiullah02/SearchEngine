The area under receiving operating curve (AUROC) reached 0.9996 and 0.9757 in the training and testing dataset, respectively. When the using cut-off value as 0.0667, the recall rate was 93.33% and 100% in the training and testing datasets, separately. Cox multivariate regression and survival analyses revealed that the model significantly discriminated the severe/critical cases and used the information of the selected clinical indicators. Conclusion: the model was robust and effective in predicting the severe/critical COVID cases.",

For feature selection, both student t-test and Wilcox rank test were assayed for each clinical/laboratory feature, and features significantly (p<0.01) different in both algorithms were retained. Survival analysis was implemented using critical/severe symptom as event, and the time to critical/severe event for survival analyses using R package \"survival\", and p<0.01 considered significant. All analysis was performed on R platform (v3.6) Demographics and clinical characteristics A total of 336 patients diagnosed as COVID-19 with PCR Kit were enrolled in this study, with 310 non-severe/critical cases and 26 severe/critical cases (Table 1). Ten out of the 26 severe/critical cases were onset of critical/severe symptom since they reached the hospital. Among these cases, 74 were from Wuhan, Hubei Province, 4 from Iran, and the other were from the other regions of China. The median age of all cases were 50 years old, the median age of non-severe patients was 48, while severe or critical patients were J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f median 65.

The data were re-arranged and cleaned, and data including few records were excluded, for example, the records of HBV loading was less than 6. Finally, 220 features were included. The clinical features were compared, by dividing into the samples into non-severe/critical and severe/critical groups. Student t-test and Wilcox rank test were used, and for features with p values <0.01 in both algorithms was considered to be significantly associated with severe/critical symptom.
