Some rheumatologists have been giving 1,200 mg/day for 6 weeks as a loading dose when starting HCQ therapy for systemic lupus erythematosus, and no visual losses have been reported, although detailed ophthalmologic examinations were not performed.5\n,\n6 Two trials of treatment of myeloma and solid tumors used 1,200 mg/day for 4-8 weeks, and again no visual loss was reported.7\n,\n8 The only high-dose ophthalmologic study by Leung and associates9 followed 7 patients at 3-month intervals for 7-25 months while using 1,000 mg/day HCQ therapy for small-cell lung cancer. By patient weight, these doses were 3-5 times greater than that recommended by the AAO. Two patients developed subtle and suggestive changes on optical coherence tomography in the parafoveal ellipsoid zone after 11 and 17 months and definitive toxicity after 15 and 25 months. None of the other patients showed damage. Thus, evidence to date indicates that extreme doses do accelerate retinal toxicity but with a probable time course of many months rather than days.",

For example, a prepublication just appeared of a small French trial of 22 COVID-19-positive patients using 600 mg/day HCQ for 10 days to reduce the viral load.10 The number of polymerase chain reaction-positive cases fell nearly 50% relative to those of controls and dropped to nearly zero if azithromycin was added. The HCQ dosage of 600 mg/day is only approximately twice that recommended by the AAO, on average, and should present no risk of retinopathy in this time frame. News media are now also citing interest in the use of CQ or HCQ intermittently as prophylaxis, much like the use for malaria, although doses have not been mentioned.",

Short-term trials (less than 2 weeks) will have negligible risk, even with doses 5-6 times the usual recommended maximum dosage of 5 mg/kg/day. Usage for a few months will still have very low risk with doses less than 3-4 times the usual level. However, if physicians suggest using these drugs for a year or more, I would strongly advise staying within the AAO recommendation and screening the patient annually.",

In a time of pandemic with worldwide shortages of medical personnel, funds, hospital beds, equipment, screening tests, and proven therapy, it would be counter-productive (and raise inappropriate fears) to suggest the addition of labor-intensive and expensive eye examinations that are of low yield. However, as new protocols arise, these steps will need to be evaluated relative to the risk of retinopathy that their particular doses and durations of use may pose. Ophthalmologists will be most effective in this time of crisis by reassuring physicians and the public where retinopathy is not a serious concern with respect to CQ or HCQ usage for coronavirus.",
