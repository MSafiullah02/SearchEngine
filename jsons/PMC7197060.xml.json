For such hard problems, it is of interest to try different well-developed, general, computational techniques. The most well-developed such technique involves formulating a computational problem as a Boolean formula in Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF), and using a SAT-solver to determine whether that CNF formula is satisfiable. We wrote programs to create CNF-formulations for four hard computational biology problems, and tested these using the widely-used SAT-solver, pLingeling [3]. We wanted to see if this SAT approach could solve problem instances that were difficult for the ILP approach, using the highly-regarded ILP solver created by Gurobi Optimization. We then did some additional testing using another highly-regarded SAT-solver, Glucose-Syrup, to check that our results were not just artifacts of using pLingeling.",

We also re-implemented and confirmed an earlier published result on the use of SAT-solving for the problem of haplotyping by pure parsimony.

Also, our reexamination of pure-parsimony haplotyping confirmed the results in [15, 16], and found extreme cases where SAT solved in a practical amount of time, but the ILP approach made little progress towards a solution.",

For computational effectiveness, an attractive simple model of globular protein folding, the HP model, was proposed by Dill [5] in 1995, and has been extensively explored since then. The model simplifies the twenty standard amino acids by dividing them into two groups: the hydrophobic (H) and the hydrophilic (P); that is, water-fearful and water-loving. Hence a protein sequence, based on an alphabet of size twenty, is reduced to a binary sequence (H or P). For the biological motivation for this model, see [8].",

It is not obvious how to use CNF formulas to count the number of potential contacts in an embedding, i.e., the number of C variables set true.

The same random sequences were used for both 2-D and 3-D and were only tested with Gurobi and pLingeling. Ten random sequences of each length from both distributions were generated for testing, so each length was tested with a total of twenty random sequences. The real sequences used are a subset of those described and used in [12] and ranged in length from six to twenty-nine for 2-D and from six to twenty-five for 3-D; all were tested using Gurobi, pLingeling, and Glucose-Syrup. All the sequences were tested five times in order to compare the variance in run times on the same sequence. The tests were done via a pipeline that generated the files for both the CNF and ILP files; passed the files to the SAT and ILP solvers; and recorded the number of contacts found and the time taken by each solver. All the tests were done using a 2018 Mac Mini with a 3.2 GHz i7 processor. The pipeline programs for both the 2-D and 3-D versions, along with the input sequences used can be found on GitHub.2\n",

Between the two SAT-solvers, pLingeling performed better than Glucose-Syrup. In the tests run on real sequences, Glucose-Syrup generally performed better on short sequences than pLingeling, but was outperformed by pLingeling for longer sequences in both the 2-D and 3-D versions. One counterpoint of importance is that there were some sequences where Gurobi took much longer than did either SAT-solver,3 and there were fewer cases where pLingeling took a similar amount more time than Gurobi.4 Thus, pLingeling exhibited somewhat greater robustness than did Gurobi. Although both the SAT and ILP formulations have O(n|G|) variables, it takes many more clauses and occurrences of un-negated and negated variables to describe the same problem using CNF than using ILP inequalities.",

There was a small subset of problem instances that both SAT-solvers were able to solve much faster than Gurobi, but this was not the norm. For the 2-D version (with sequences between length 6 and length 29), pLingeling was able to reach a solution to most in less than 30 min, with none taking longer than three hours. Glucose-Syrup took at least twice as long as pLingeling on most of the real sequences longer than 24, but performed slightly better on shorter sequences. Gurobi had times under ten minutes for most sequences between length 6 and 27 in 2-D; however, at lengths 28 and 29 the times became much less consistent, ranging from under 10 min to more than 48 h.

One such informative biological phenomenon is long chromosomal reversals (inversions), where the DNA in a long interval on a chromosome reverses direction. For example, if we represent each gene by a distinct integer, the interval with ten genes: 1 10 4 5 2 6 3 9 8 7 becomes: 1 10 6 2 5 4 3 9 8 7 when the interval containing 4 5 2 6 is reversed. Since genes can be separated by long distances on a chromosome, what seems like a small reversal of just four integers actually represents a very long chromosomal reversal. It is believed that long chromosomal reversals are much rarer, with longer periods of time between reversals, than are mutations of single nucleotides, so long chromosomal reversals allow us to look farther back into evolutionary history. So, what we are interested in is the order of the genes on the chromosome, and how that order changes over time.

In short, the CHB algorithm reduces M to the empty matrix by iterating three rules for removing rows or columns. In one rule (called the \\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$D_t$$\\end{document} rule), the choice of row removal is arbitrary, so different executions of the algorithm, with the same input, can remove a different set of rows.

This minimization problem was first examined in [6], where an exponential-size ILP formulation was developed.13 That ILP formulation solves very quickly for instances where the formulation fits into main memory. However, rapid growth of the formulation size limits the size of the instances that can be handled. Later (in 2004 and 2006), polynomial-sized ILP formulations were developed [4, 13], but ILP solvers at that time were not able to solve problem instances of interest in a practical amount of time. Subsequently (in 2006), a SAT-formulation, based on the general ideas in [4, 13] and additional improvements, was developed in [15, 16], and was shown to be highly effective. Those results used ILP and SAT-solvers that are much slower than current solvers. So, we re-implemented the ILP and SAT approaches14 to see how the more modern SAT-solver, pLingeling, and the fastest current ILP-solver, Gurobi 9.0, handle this problem.
