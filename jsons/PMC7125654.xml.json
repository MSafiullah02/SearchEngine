However, its survival chance is still basically dependent on tumor types, time of diagnosis and of course, clinical therapies [3]. The detection of tumor markers has been widely used to screen cancers on a population basis [4]. Although it contributes to cancer diagnosis and clinical therapies, tumor marker detection results cannot act as a direct evidence to confirm cancer presence because of the lack of detection specificity. In order to increase the detection specificity, several tumor markers are combined to detect cancers and improved results are acquired. However, joint detection of tumor markers is much more complicated than single marker detection and raises the requirement to detection methods. Thus, the need for effective methods to detect tumor marker combinations rapidly, sensitively and reliably is consequently subjected to broad interest.",

            "text": "Imaging ellipsometry [5], [6] is derived from the conventional ellipsometry by introducing an expanded beam and a CCD camera instead of the traditional narrow beam and the photodiode detector. These changes render the unique advantages of conventional ellipsometry and microscope to imaging ellipsometry. Imaging ellipsometry is not only a label-free characterization technique with high resolution but it also owns a large field of view, providing the capability to detect a considerable area at the same time [7], [8]. The concept of imaging ellipsometry biosensor (IEB) for visualization of biomolecular interactions was proposed in 1995 [9], [10]. With the developments these years, it has become automatic equipment [11], [12] for protein interaction analysis. IEB is primarily composed of a microfluidic reactor [13] and an imaging ellipsometer [10], [14]. The microfluidic reactor is served to fabricate a patterned protein microarray; while the imaging ellipsometer is used to measure the surface mass concentration distribution of a protein microarray. So far, IEB has accumulated several application experiences in biological and clinical fields, for instance, five markers of hepatitis B virus [15], tumor markers [16], [17], phage M13KO7\n[18], severe acute respiratory syndrome virus [19], avian influenza virus [20] and ricin antibody identification [21].",

A mixture solution prepared with 0.05 mol/mL NHS and 0.2 mol/mL EDC in deionized water is passed through the surface at a flow rate of 5 \u03bcL/min for 5 min. With NHS and EDC, carboxyl groups on the substrate form sulfo-NHS-ester and are able to react with the amino groups of protein A. Then, protein A at 0.2 mg/mL is adsorbed on the substrate at a flow rate of 1 \u03bcL/min for 15 min. AFP, AFU and ferritin antibodies are immobilized by protein A for 20 min at a flow rate of 1 \u03bcL/min. After that, the surface is blocked by IgG from the same species to the ligands and blocking buffer, respectively. Such IgG can be bound to protein A, but it cannot react with AFP, AFU, ferritin and human serum. It is used to occupy protein A left on the sensing surface and prevent the specific binding between protein A and antibody in the analyte solution. Blocking buffer can also bind to the biosensing surface and avoid the non-specific adsorption with the addition of analyte solution, especially, serum samples. After surface blocking, AFP, AFU and ferritin standard samples are delivered into their corresponding sensing surfaces at a flow rate of 1 \u03bcL/min for 20 min. Finally, rinsed with plenty of PBST and completely dried under nitrogen, the microarray is sampled and stored into a gray-scale image by the imaging ellipsometer.",

By preliminary experiments, different detection procedure parameters have been compared and a compromised yet optimized condition has been utilized to establish AFP, AFU and ferritin calibration curves (shown in Section 2.4). Meanwhile, ligand concentration is also needed to be optimized in order to obtain good detection sensitivity and wide detection range. A series of concentrations of AFP, AFU and ferritin antibodies have been screened to find out the optimized value to construct their sensing surface and the optimization concentration values for AFP, AFU and ferritin antibodies are 120 \u03bcg/mL, 80 \u03bcg/mL and 60 \u03bcg/mL, respectively.
