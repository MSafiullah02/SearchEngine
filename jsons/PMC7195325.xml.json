            "text": "COVID-19 (Corona Virus Disease 2019, also known as 2019-nCoV), a cluster of acute respiratory illness with unknown causes, occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China sincein early December 2019 (Paules et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2020). The COVID-19 pandemic has swept into over 200 countires with considerable confirmed cases and deaths, and has caused public panic and mental health stress. In China, the public has shown severe anxiety-related behaviors, causing a significant shortage of medical related materials across the country. Besides, many front-line medical staff work overloaded for a long time causing them to not get enough rest. Evidence indicated that mental health problems could occur in both healthcare workers and survivors during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak (Lee et al., 2007\nLee et al., 2018). Based on the above research evidence, we have reason to speculate that the psychological condition of the Chinese public may also be affected during the COVID-19 pandemic. Therefore, using a web-based cross-sectional study, we aimed to assess the mental health burden of Chinese population during the COVID-19 pandemic, and to explore the potential influence factors.",
