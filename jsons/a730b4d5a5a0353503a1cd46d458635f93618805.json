More recent studies have revealed that patterns of codon usage bias and nucleotide composition within many cellular genomes are far more complex than previously imagined, and the factors shaping their evolution are still not entirely understood. In general, natural selection and/or mutation pressure for accurate and efficient translation in various organisms are the main reasons to this bias.

Cardiovirus. The synonymous codon usage bias in coding regions of both EMCV and ThV are low because the mean ENC values of 54.86 and 51.08 respectively (higher than 40). This is in agreement with previous reports about some other RNA viruses, for example, BVDV (mean ENC = 51.42), H5N1 (mean ENC = 50.91) and SARS-covs (mean ENC = 48.99) [6, 7, 21] . A low codon usage bias is advantageous to replicate efficiently in vertebrate host cells, with potentially distinct codon preferences. However there is a marked variation in codon usage pattern among different Theilovirus genes (S.D. = 6.41) compared to the EMCV genes (S.D. = 0.36). One explanation about this phenomenon is that the ThV probably has four serotypes while the EMCV just has one and the serotype might affect the codon choice. A general mutational pressure, which affects the whole genome, would certainly account for the majority of the codon usage variation. In this study, the general association between codon usage bias and base composition suggests that mutational pressure, rather than natural selection, is mainly supported by the highly significant correlation between (C+G) 12 % and (C+G) 3 % (r = -0.736 for EMCV; r = 0.986 for ThV, P < 0.01), since the effects are present at all codon positions. Also the (G +C) content was another factor which was found to be strong correlated with codon usage bias. In this study, the results indicated the (C+G) content played an important role in codon usage bias for ThV (Table 3) , but not for EMCV. This is a little complex for EMCV and we need to do more research for this genus such as each nucleotide composition, gene structure and so on to find the main factor for codon bias of EMCV.
