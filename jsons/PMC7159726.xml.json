About a third of healthcare providers surveyed in this study reported headaches with the N95 face\u2010mask wear and we identified pre\u2010existing headaches and prolonged duration of N95 face\u2010mask wear as important risk factors for the development of these headaches.

Headaches have been ascribed to both hypoxemia and hypercarbia (6), the latter notably in scuba divers who develop hypercarbia secondary to inadequate ventilation of compressed gases (12). Hypoxemia was similarly observed from the use of the N95 face\u2010masks, where increased respiratory rate and higher incidence of chest discomfort were observed during the use of the N95 face\u2010mask for a 4\u2010hour stretch (13).

It is possible that the headaches occurring in those wearing helmets, goggles and close\u2010fitting N95 face\u2010masks may have arisen due to pressure from the strap on the neck or back of the head over the superficial nerves, may aggravate an underlying cervical neck strain and exacerbate face\u2010mask\u2010associated headaches. The contribution of stress to the development of headaches is suggested by a proportion of respondents who developed tension\u2010type headaches (n = 43, 54.4%) compared with the other headache subtypes. Stress is known to exacerbate tension\u2010type headaches (15), but is also described with migraines and cluster headaches (16).",

Although the study was performed a year following the first\u2010reported case of SARS in our country, recall biases were limited as the respondents were still wearing the N95 face\u2010masks during the study period. Future studies of N95 face\u2010mask\u2010associated headaches should preferably be prospectively designed, with study controls, and should include the assessment of psychological stress and sleep disturbances.",

This study highlights the relatively high prevalence of headaches with the use of the N95 face\u2010mask amongst healthcare workers working in high\u2010risk areas.
