As an insight for an effective coronavirus hand-washing, hexachlorophene, a very potent bisphenol antiseptic agent, was the active ingredient of two discontinued hospital hand-wash soaps: Septisol and pHisohex. In a screen for small molecules, hexachlorophene and nitazoxanide demonstrated inhibition to Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus. 2 Nitazoxanide is currently being tested in clinical trials for SARS-CoV-2 (NCT04541493), and exhibited similar inhibitory potential of remdesivir in vitro. 3 . If not discontinued for important environmental and newborn toxic risks, hexachlorophene could have represented an ideal candidate for hand-washing product in high risk COVID-19 hospital areas, due to residue on the skin after rinsing.",

As such, the presence of TMPRSS2 in skin capillaries may be a possibility, allowing the transmission of SARS-CoV-2. Since TMPRSS2 expression is androgen receptor-dependent, hormonal expression might be the key gateway for vulnerability to SARS-CoV-2. 5 Currently, the need for external hormones could be reevaluated in healthcare workerssuch as the use of progestins with androgenic activity (for example levonorgestrel or medroxyprogesterone) and the use of androgen replacement therapy -because of the likelihood of increased TMPRSS2 expression in all tissues where it is expressed, including airways and blood vessels. coronaviruses through labile blood products still theoretically possible. 6 Fissures are known to be a transmission route for many pathogens, including other positive-sense, enveloped, RNA viruses such as HIV and Hepatitis C. 7 Fissures and erosions represent discontinuity of the epithelium coverage, making damaged mucosa and skin functionally equivalent for the purposes of the transmission we hypothesize as possible.",
