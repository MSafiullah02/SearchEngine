Three genotypes of BuV have been identified. We detected, by in-house EIA, BuV1-3 IgG antibodies in 7/228 children (3.1%) and 10/180 adults (5.6%), whereas TuV IgG was found in one child (0.4%). All children and 91% of the adults were Finnish, yet interestingly 3/6 adults of Indian origin were BuV-IgG positive. By competition EIA, no cross-reactivity between the BuVs was detected, indicating that the BuV genotypes represent distinct serotypes. Furthermore, we analysed by BuV qPCR stool and nasal swab samples from 955 children with gastroenteritis, respiratory illness, or both, and found BuV DNA in three stools (0.3%) and for the first time in a nasal swab (0.1%). This is the first study documenting the presence of BuV and TuV antibodies in humans. Although the seroprevalences of both viruses were low in Finland, our results indicate that BuV infections might be widespread in Asia. The BuV-specific humoral immune responses appeared to be strong and long-lasting, pointing to systemic infection in humans.",

Samples with OD values below 0.1 were too difficult to unambiguously confirm by blocking and were thus considered negative. Of note, the determination of an exact cutoff value was not crucial for the interpretation of the results as all samples with OD values of \u2265 0.1 were confirmed by competition assay and only the confirmed results were considered genuinely positive. The antibodies in all BuV-or TuV-seropositive samples showed no cross-reactivity between the BuV genotypes or TuV, including the triple-BuV seropositive plasma (Case 1; Table 3 ). Both in a high-positive adult (Case 1) and in a low-positive adult (Case 5), we could show that the BuV antibody levels and specificity remained constant for at least six years (Table 2) . Furthermore, among the 84 medical students, the BuV1-3 and TuV IgG EIA results correlated neither with each other nor with the previously analysed IgG EIA results of six other human parvoviruses: HBoV1-4, PARV4, or parvovirus B19 (data not shown) [19] [20] [21] .",

Some of these High5 backgrounds would have yielded incorrect positivity in the unblocked BuV IgG EIAs, more with BuV2 and 3 than BuV1 or TuV antigens. However, we were able to distinguish false from genuine reactivity by competing with insect cell lysate, as can be seen in patient number 4 (Tables 2 and 3) : the BuV2 and BuV3 reactivities were completely blocked in the competition assay by insect cells, but less or not at all by VLPs of either of these two BuVs, whereas the BuV1 result was blocked with the homologous BuV1 (Table 3 ). In our previous studies we have seen the same phenomenon with Sf9 insect cells. Human antibodies towards insect cell components should therefore be considered when applying in EIA insect cell-derived antigens.",

Of the Asian subjects 5/12 were positive, and the highest number was observed among Indian persons of whom 3/6 were BuV-IgG positive. These individuals had also the highest BuV IgG OD values, unlike the children or adults of Finnish descent. In addition, the prevalence of BuV antibodies in Finnish children (3.1%, 7/228) was identical to that in the native Finnish adults (3.1%, 5/163) raising the question why the BuV IgG prevalence did not increase with age. Although we did show that the antibody levels among adults can remain constant for at least six years, waning of the antibodies over time might play a role. Furthermore, if the primary infection of the host is local and superficial, it might not induce a strong long-lasting antibody response. With HBoVs it has been shown that exposure to homo-or heterologous HBoV species may boost the antibody response 28, 29 . Thus, the similar BuV seroprevalence among Finnish adults and children might be a consequence of the general rarity of BuV infections in the Nordic countries, leading to inadequate maintenance of antibody responses.",

These BuV2 or 3 IgG-positive children were 7 months to 5 years of age at the time of sampling (2009 to 2011), suggesting that BuV2 and maybe BuV3 might have circulated in Finland between 2006 and 2011. Unfortunately, we do not have travel information of these children. The BuV3 antibodies in the two 7-to 8-month-old infants might be maternal.

The variants of human parvovirus B19 (B19V) differ in VP2 aa sequence by only 1-2% 30, 31 , and cross-react fully in EIA. Therefore, B19V serodiagnosis can be done reliably using as antigen VP2 VLPs of any of the variants [32] [33] [34] . On the other hand, the more divergent four HBoVs (with a 11-23% difference in the major capsid protein aa sequence) are partly cross-reactive in EIA 19 . The cross-reactivity can be visualized by blocking the serum with heterologous HBoVs prior to the EIA. To identify such cross-reactivity is a prerequisite for correct interpretation of the HBoV EIA results 19, 29 . The human bufavirus genotypes differ by 27-36% in VP2 4 , and in our EIA analysis the BuV genotypes were not cross-reactive. Neither the BuV genotype, the antibody level in the sample, nor the age of the subject affected assay specificity. Interestingly, we found one adult and one child with specific antibodies towards more than one BuV type (case 1 with a triple and case 7 with a double positivity, shown in Fig. 2 ).

Of both adults and children 5-6% had antibodies towards insect cell constituents, which would cause false positivity without competition assays. Such false reactions should be considered when applying insect-cell produced antigens in EIA. This is the first published human study of TuV since the initial article. While we found a single child to exhibit TuV IgG, in confirmatory blocking a 5-fold higher concentration of the homologous antigen was required than in the corresponding BuV EIAs, to block the IgG binding. As none of the other antigens (BuV1-3) or insect cell lysate blocked the TuV IgG reactivity, the result was considered TuV specific. More studies are nevertheless needed to confirm whether TuV actually is a human virus.",

We furthermore showed that the three bufaviruses represent different serotypes: none of the BuVs nor TuV were mutually cross-reactive in the cohorts studied. While in Finland the seroprevalences of both of these protoparvoviruses were low, we observed both higher OD values and a higher seroprevalence of BuV among persons with an Asian origin, indicating that BuV infections might be more common in other countries, particularly in India. The BuV-specific immune responses of all three serotypes appeared to be strong and lasting, pointing to systemic infections. Overall, our results together with those of others indicate that BuV is a human virus, whereas additional studies are needed to assess the host tropism of TuV and the clinical correlates and global epidemiology of these viruses as well as their transmission route(s).",

Each reactive sample was separately blocked both with the homologous antigen, which should fully block a specific reaction, and with all four heterologous antigens, which should not block the specific reaction. The overall BuV-IgG result after competition was considered positive when no heterologous blocking occurred and the residual OD fell upon homologous blocking (i) below OD 0.2, when the non-blocked OD was > 0.5; (ii) below OD 0.15, when the non-blocked OD was 0.3-0.5; and (iii) below 50% of the non-blocked OD, when the non-blocked ODs were low, 0.1-0.3.
