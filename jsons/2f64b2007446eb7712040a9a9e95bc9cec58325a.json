This desire to quickly find safe and effective treatments may also lead to relaxed standards of data generation and interpretation, which may have undesirable downstream effects. The recent publication of a study evaluating hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) in COVID-19 is a useful test case, highlighting the challenges of conducting research during a pandemic.",

Preclinical data suggested that the antimalarials HCQ and chloroquine have in vitro antiviral activity against severe acute respiratory syndromecoronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (1-3). Antimalarials are also inexpensive, are widely available, and have an acceptable short-term safety profile. In a nonrandomized study, Gautret and colleagues (4) reported a higher frequency of SARS-CoV-2 clearance from the nasopharynx after 6 days of treatment with HCQ, plus azithromycin (AZM) if deemed necessary, versus an untreated control group (14 of 20 patients [70%] vs. 2 of 16 patients [13%]; P < 0.001). Given the urgency of the situation, some limitations of this study may be acceptable, including the small sample size, use of an unvalidated surrogate end point, and lack of randomization or blinding. However, other methodological flaws also noted by others (5) may affect the validity of the findings, even in the current setting, where an efficacious treatment is desperately needed.",

Instead of excluding patients who declined treatment, the researchers assigned them to the control group. The remainder of the control group was recruited from other centers that could not contribute to the treatment group. This introduces the potential for baseline confounding and different treatment regimens at different institutions. In addition, patients in the HCQ + AZM group had lower viral loads at the time of treatment initiation compared with the control and HCQ groups, and so may have been at a later phase of infection. All patients who received HCQ + AZM had a SARS-CoV-2 baseline cycle threshold (Ct) greater than 22 on polymerase chain re-action (PCR). Of the 5 patients receiving HCQ who had a baseline Ct of 22 or less on PCR (that is, higher viral burden), 4 still had detectable virus at day 6. Of the 9 patients with a baseline Ct greater than 22 on PCR, only 2 had detectable virus at day 6. Thus, another explanation is that the baseline viral load, not therapy with HCQ + AZM, affects viral load at day 6.",

Consequently, 75% (12 of 16 patients) of the control group lacked at least 1 PCR result, including 44% (7 of 16 patients) who were not tested on at least 4 of the 7 possible days. In the HCQ + AZM group, only 20% (4 of 20 patients) were missing at least 1 PCR result and none were missing more than 2.

Only 20 of 26 patients in the treatment group were included in the analysis despite meeting baseline eligibility criteria. Six patients were excluded because day 6 PCR data were missing, owing to early treatment cessation due to nausea (n = 1), hospital discharge (n = 1), intensive care unit transfer (n = 3), and death (n = 1). Therefore, patients who had the most serious and clinically relevant outcomes, including intensive care unit transfer and death, were excluded from analysis. These patients had treatment failure and should have been analyzed as such. We strongly agree with others that adequate follow-up of patients with relevant outcomes should be attempted (6) .",

Several major medical organizations released a joint statement regarding the HCQ shortage (www .lupus.org/s3fs-public/pdf/Joint-Statement-on-HCQ -LFA-ACR-AADA-AF.pdf), warning of possible dire consequences for patients with rheumatic diseases. Hydroxychloroquine shortages could place these patients at risk for severe and even life-threatening flares; some may require hospitalization when hospitals are already at capacity. Until reliable evidence is generated and adequate supply chains have been put in place, rational use of HCQ in patients with COVID-19 must be emphasized, such as use in investigational studies.",

There currently are no data to recommend the use of HCQ as prophylaxis for COVID-19, although we eagerly await data from trials under way. Thus, we discourage its offlabel use until justified and supply is bolstered. The HCQ shortage not only will limit availability to patients with COVID-19 if efficacy is truly established but also represents a real risk to patients with rheumatic diseases who depend on HCQ for their survival.
