In 1983, baculoviruses were first explored as vectors for the expression of human interferon \u03b2 (IFN\u2010\u03b2) in insect cells (Smith et al., 1983). Since then, the potential of the baculovirus\u2013insect cell expression system has been fully exploited for the production of numerous recombinant proteins (reviewed in Beljelarskaya 2002, Luckow 1988, Patterson 1995) and baculovirus research advanced insect cell culture as a force in the field of biotechnology. One of the reasons for the increasing popularity of the baculovirus\u2013insect cell expression system is safety, because baculoviruses are regarded as nonpathogenic to humans, and the baculovirus host range is restricted to insects and invertebrates.",

The nuclear DNA, however, did not persist and there was no evidence that baculovirus DNA was transcribed in mammalian cells (Tjia et al., 1983). Later, Volkman and Goldsmith (1983) demonstrated that baculoviruses can be internalized by nontarget vertebrate cells such as human lung carcinoma cell line A427. Carbonell et al. (1985) further confirmed that baculoviruses entered mammalian cells and mediated very low\u2010level expression of Escherichia coli chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) under the control of polyhedrin and Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) promoters. However, the significance of these findings was not widely noted until a decade later.",

            "text": "In the mid\u20101990s, two pioneer groups reported that recombinant baculoviruses harboring a cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter\u2010luciferase gene cassette (Hofmann et al., 1995) or an RSV long terminal repeat (LTR) promoter\u2010\u03b2\u2010galactosidase (\u03b2\u2010gal) gene cassette (Boyce and Bucher, 1996) efficiently expressed the reporter genes in mammalian cells. The data suggested a strong preference of baculovirus vectors to transduce hepatocytes of different origins (e.g., human and rabbit), because efficient transduction and high\u2010level expression were only observed in primary hepatocytes and hepatoma cells. Significantly, lower reporter gene expression was observed in several other cell lines (e.g., COS\u20101 and 293) and little to no expression was observed in other cell types including A549, CHO, NIH\u20103T3, and CV\u20101 cells. The authors suggested that the block to expression in less susceptible cells might be subsequent to viral entry, rather than the ability to be internalized by the target cells, because high\u2010 and low\u2010expressing cell lines internalized similar amounts of virus (Boyce and Bucher, 1996). One factor accounting for the low apparent transduction efficiency in certain cell types is promoter strength; Shoji et al. (1997) showed that cells that were not transduced by a baculovirus\u2010expressing \u03b2\u2010gal under the control of the CMV promoter could be efficiently transduced by a baculovirus expressing the same reporter protein under the transcriptional control of the stronger CAG promoter. Furthermore, Shoji et al. (1997) compared the gene expression by baculovirus and adenovirus vectors using the same expression unit and observed the same level of expression in HepG2, HeLa, and COS\u20107 cells by both vectors. They even demonstrated efficient expression and proper processing of hepatitis C virus (HCV) protein mediated by a baculovirus vector. These pioneering studies paved the way for use of baculoviral vectors as tools for gene delivery into mammalian cells.",

These cells include cell lines originating from cells of human (e.g., HeLa, Huh\u20107, HepG2, keratinocytes, bone marrow fibroblasts), rodent (e.g., CHO, BHK), porcine (e.g., CPK, PK15), bovine (e.g., BT), and even fish (e.g., EPC, CHH\u20101) origin (Table I\n). In addition, baculoviruses are capable of transducing nondividing cells, such as PK1 cells arrested in S phase (van Loo et al., 2001). Transduction of primary cells, such as human neural cells (Sarkis et al., 2000), pancreatic islet cells (Ma et al., 2000), and rat articular chondrocytes (Ho et al., 2004), has also been observed. In addition, Wagle and Jesuthasan (2003) showed that baculoviruses successfully transduced the embryos of zebrafish. EphrinB2a is normally expressed in the posterior region of developing somites and baculovirus\u2010mediated misexpression by injection of the baculovirus expressing ephrinB2a into specific tissues, caused abnormal somite boundary formation (Wagle and Jesuthasan, 2003). Moreover, we demonstrated that baculoviruses are capable of transducing mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) derived from human umbilical cord blood and bone marrow (Ho et al., 2005), as well as MSC\u2010derived adipogenic, osteogenic, and chondrogenic progenitor cells (Ho et al., 2006). Despite the rapidly growing list of cells permissive to baculovirus transduction, however, baculovirus transduction of cell lines of hematopoietic origin, such as U937, K562, Raw264.7 (Condreay et al., 1999), LCL\u2010cm, and Raji (Cheng et al., 2004), is inefficient. As the spectrum of cell types permissive to baculovirus transduction expands, the potential applications of baculovirus vectors are receiving increasing attention. Table II\nlists some of the applications of baculoviruses that have been explored (see also chapter by Condreay et al., pp. 255\u2013286; van Oers, pp. 193\u2013253; and M\u00e4kel\u00e4 and Oker\u2010Blom, pp. 91\u2013112, this volume).",

Following virus entry, gp64 further mediates the acid\u2010induced endosomal escape, thus allowing for nucleocapsid transport into the cytoplasm and nucleus (Blissard and Wenz, 1992). Similarly, gp64 is essential for virus attachment and endosomal escape in mammalian cells (Hofmann et al., 1998). In support of the importance of gp64 is the finding that a monoclonal antibody specific for gp64 abolishes the capability of baculovirus vectors to transduce mammalian cells (Gronowski et al., 1999). A baculovirus overexpressing gp64 from an additional gp64 gene can incorporate \u223c1.5 times the normal amount of gp64 on the virion surface and exhibit 10\u2010 to 100\u2010fold more reporter gene expression in a variety of mammalian cells when compared to the control baculovirus (Tani et al., 2001). The importance of gp64 for virus transduction is further substantiated as a mutant virus lacking gp64 on the viral envelope failed to transduce mammalian cells (Abe et al., 2005). Furthermore, gp64 of AcMNPV was shown to rescue transduction of mammalian cells by HaSNPV (Helicoverpa armigera single nucleopolyhedrovirus), a virus that does not transduce mammalian cells. The range of mammalian cell types transduced by HaSNPV expressing the gp64 of AcMNPV was consistent with those transduced by AcMNPV (Lang et al., 2005).",

Initially, it was suggested that baculovirus transduction was liver specific and that asialoglycoprotein could be involved in virus binding (Boyce 1996, Hofmann 1995). However, van Loo et al. (2001) showed that Pk1 cells, which do not express asialoglycoprotein receptors, can be successfully transduced, and hence asialoglycoprotein is not a key determinant. It was also shown that electrostatic interactions may be necessary for baculovirus binding to the mammalian cell surface because preincubation of 293 cells with polybrene, a cationic compound that neutralizes negatively charged epitopes on the cell membrane, resulted in a rapid decrease in virus binding (Duisit et al., 1999). The same group also suggested that heparan sulfate may act as an important docking motif for baculovirus binding because removal of heparan sulfate from the cell surface by heparanase I or III prior to transduction reduced transgene (LacZ) expression by \u224850% (Duisit et al., 1999). Aside from heparan sulfate, phospholipids on the cell surface were suggested to serve as an important docking point for gp64, thus facilitating viral entry into mammalian cells (Tani et al., 2001).",

(2003) demonstrated that paracellular junction complexes are important barriers for baculoviral entry into primary hepatocytes. In contrast, we found that EGTA treatment of Huh\u20107 cells and chondrocytes does not significantly enhance transduction efficiencies although disruption of cell junctions was apparent (unpublished data). Despite the discrepancies in identification of the surface receptors, multiple lines of evidence suggest that baculoviruses are internalized by endocytosis (Condreay 1999, van 2001). By electron and confocal microscopy, Matilainen et al. confirmed that baculoviruses enter HepG2 cells via clathrin\u2010mediated endocytosis. However, baculovirus attachment to clathrin\u2010coated pits seemed to be a relatively rare phenomenon, and therefore other internalization mechanisms (possibly via macropinocytosis) may also exist (Matilainen et al., 2005). Virus attachment does not appear to be limiting, because baculoviruses can efficiently bind to NIH\u20103T3, a cell line less susceptible to baculovirus transduction, even at 4\u00b0C (Stanbridge et al., 2003).",

            "text": "Having entered the mammalian cell, budded virus is transported to the endosome, followed by acid\u2010induced endosomal escape of the nucleocapsid mediated by gp64. Endosomal escape was first uncovered by treating baculovirus\u2010transduced mammalian cells with a lysosomotropic agent (e.g., chloroquine), which inhibits endosomal maturation and subsequent baculovirus\u2010mediated gene expression (Boyce 1996, Hofmann 1995). The importance of endosomal escape was further confirmed by treating HepG2 cells with monensin, which blocked early endosome acidification and trapped the nucleocapsids in the endosome (Kukkonen et al., 2003). Therefore, it is generally assumed that escape from the endosomes blocks baculovirus transduction of some mammalian cells (Barsoum 1997, Boyce 1996). However, Kukkonen et al. (2003) suggested that the block may lie not in escape from the endosome, but rather in cytoplasmic trafficking or nuclear import of the nucleocapsids. In cells nonpermissive to baculovirus\u2010mediated transduction (e.g., EAHY, MG63, and NHO cells), virus is internalized and routed to the endosome 30 min posttransduction, and escapes from the endosome by 4 h posttransduction, but the nucleocapsid does not enter the nucleus efficiently. Accordingly, no detectable transgene expression is observed even with a very high virus load. In contrast, baculoviruses are capable of entering HepG2 cells (which are highly permissive to baculovirus transduction), escaping from the endosome and entering the nucleus 4 h after transduction. Consistent with this notion is that direct injection of nucleocapsids into the cytoplasm does not affect the translocation of nucleocapsids into the nucleus, demonstrating that endosomal escape is not necessarily a critical step (Salminen et al., 2005). Nucleocapsids are transported into different subcellular compartments in different cells (Abe et al., 2005). In 293T cells, the nucleocapsids reached the nucleus where the transgene was efficiently transcribed following uncoating. However, in the nonpermissive macrophage RAW264.7 cells, the nucleocapsids appeared to be trapped by the phagocytic pathway, and degraded viral DNA was then transported into toll\u2010like receptor 9 (TLR9)\u2010expressing intracellular compartments (Abe et al., 2005).",

Cytochalasin D, an agent causing reversible depolymerization of actin filaments, strongly inhibits reporter gene expression, but does not prevent the uptake of enveloped virions inside cytoplasmic vesicles, or prevent their escape into the cytoplasm (van Loo et al., 2001). More recently, it was shown that disintegration of microtubules by microtubule\u2010depolymerizing agents (e.g., nocodazole and vinblastine) significantly enhanced the nuclear transport of virus and subsequent transgene expression in HepG2 cells (Salminen et al., 2005), suggesting that intact microtubules constituted a barrier to baculovirus transport toward the nucleus. The viral genome, major capsid protein, and electron\u2010dense capsids were also found inside the nucleus, suggesting that the nucleocapsid was transported through the nuclear pore (van Loo et al., 2001).

(2004) systematically compared the transgene expression driven by Simian virus 40 (SV40), CMV, RSV, and a cellular promoter (human ubiquitin C) in CHO, COS\u20101, and HEK293 cells. The CMV and RSV promoters were the most active in all cell lines tested, followed by the ubiquitin C promoter. SV40 promoter was the weakest among these four promoters.",

One of the hr regions, hr1, enhances transcription from the polyhedrin and the Drosophila heat shock protein (hsp70) promoters in insect cells (e.g., Sf9) in trans (Venkaiah et al., 2004). Yet hr1 also functions in mammalian cells (e.g., Vero and HepG2) as an enhancer when present in cis and in trans (Viswanathan et al., 2003). The upregulation of gene expression by hr1 probably stems from binding of hr1 with high affinity and specificity to nuclear factors in mammalian cells, thereby stimulating transcription (Viswanathan et al., 2003). The insertion of an additional copy of the hr1 region into the AcMNPV genome thus represents an attractive approach for overexpression of foreign proteins in mammalian cells (Venkaiah et al., 2004). The additional hr1 also improves the genetic stability of the bacmid\u2010derived baculovirus and consequently prolongs expression of the heterologous protein, because spontaneous deletion of the heterologous gene(s) in the foreign bacterial artificial chromosome sequences readily occurs (Pijlman 2001, Pijlman 2004).",

The cells are then incubated with the virus for 1 h at 37\u00b0C in growth medium (e.g., DMEM) (Boyce 1996, Shoji 1997, Tani 2003). We developed a protocol by which incubation of unconcentrated virus (i.e., virus supernatant harvested from infected cell culture) with cells at lower temperature (e.g., 25\u00b0C or 27\u00b0C) for 4\u20138 h in PBS resulted in gene transfer into HeLa, chondrocytes (Ho 2004, Hsu 2004), and human MSC (Ho et al., 2005) with efficiencies comparable or superior to those using traditional protocols. Specifically, the transduction efficiencies of human MSC derived from umbilical cord blood can be elevated from 42% (using the conventional protocol) to 73% (using the modified protocol). This protocol eliminates the need for virus ultracentrifugation, and hence not only represents a simpler approach but also reduces the chance for virus loss or inactivation during ultracentrifugation.",

Modification can be performed by fusing a heterologous gene in frame at the 5\u2032 end of the gp64 gene under the control of the polyhedrin or p10 promoter. The fusion protein, after expression as an additional copy, is translocated to the plasma membrane and incorporated into the viral envelope on virus budding. Use of this approach was first demonstrated by fusion of human immunodeficiency virus\u20101 (HIV\u20101) envelope proteins to gp64 and the modified budded virus bound to the CD4 receptor on T cells (Boublik et al., 1995). A similar strategy was applied to construct avidin\u2010displaying baculoviruses, which showed a 5\u2010fold increase in transduction efficiency in rat malignant glioma cells and a 26\u2010fold increase in transduction efficiency in rabbit aortic smooth muscle cells compared to the wild\u2010type baculovirus (Raty et al., 2004). Baculoviruses displaying heterologous envelope proteins, such as vesicular stomatitis virus G protein (VSVG), have also been constructed. These vectors transduce human hepatoma and rat neuronal cells at efficiencies roughly 10\u2010 to 100\u2010fold greater than baculoviruses lacking VSVG (Barsoum et al., 1997). This pseudotyped virus also transduced cell lines that are transduced at very low levels by the unmodified baculovirus, thus broadening the tropism. The enhanced transduction efficiency and wider tropism are attributed to the increased transport of baculovirus DNA into nuclei rather than to the increased binding or virus uptake (Barsoum et al., 1997).",

This failure stems from inactivation of the baculovirus vector in the presence of native serum, because baculoviruses activate the classical pathway of the complement system (Hofmann et al., 1998).

Hofmann and Strauss (1998) demonstrated that the survival of a baculovirus vector in human serum can be enhanced through treatment with a functional antibody\u2010blocking complement component 5 (C5). Meanwhile, the complement inhibitor sCR1 (soluble complement receptor type 1) protects baculoviruses from serum inactivation in vitro and coadministration of sCR1 along with intraportal administration of the baculovirus vector leads to hepatic expression in mice (Hoare et al., 2005). Inactivation of baculoviruses in human plasma and whole blood can be prevented by treatment with cobra venom factor (CVF), an inhibitor of the complement system (Hofmann and Strauss, 1998). By injecting CVF into mice one day prior to baculovirus administration, Sarkis et al. (2000) demonstrated that the baculovirus was not inactivated by the complement system and could transduce neural cells (mainly astrocytes) in vivo when directly injected into the brain of rodents. Surprisingly, they observed the same level of expression in animals without treatment of CVF, suggesting that the baculovirus was not inactivated by the complement system. These contradictory observations were probably caused by the particular immunological characteristics of the brain (Sarkis et al., 2000) or differences in stereotaxic coordinates and injection pressure, or speed (Lehtolainen et al., 2002).",

Gene expression was transient remaining high level for 1 week but disappearing by day 14, and the arterial structure and endothelium remained intact after baculovirus transduction. Baculovirus vectors have also been injected into the rodent brain where complement proteins may be absent because of the blood\u2013brain barrier, or the complement level in the brain may be insufficient to affect gene transfer (Lehtolainen et al., 2002). After in vivo injection into the brain, baculoviruses specifically transduced the epithelium of the choroids plexus in ventricles and the transduction efficiency was as high as 76 \u00b1 14%. In contrast, adenovirus vectors showed preference to corpus callosum glial cells and ventricular ependymal lining. Hence, baculovirus vectors are especially useful for targeting of choroids plexus cells (Lehtolainen et al., 2002).",

Such complement\u2010resistant baculovirus vectors allow for a substantial improvement of gene transfer into neonatal rats in vivo after local injection into the liver parenchyma. Expression of the transgene (human coagulation factor IX, hFIX) was transient probably as a result of the generation of antibodies directed against the transgene product hFIX, which might lead to clearance of either expressed hFIX protein and/or positively transduced cells. Alternatively, baculoviruses can be pseudotyped by displaying VSVG on the envelope. The VSVG\u2010modified virus enhanced gene transfer efficiencies into mouse skeletal muscle in vivo and the transgene expression lasted 178 days in DBA/2J mice and 35 days in BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice (Pieroni et al., 2001). The VSVG\u2010modified baculovirus also exhibited greater resistance to inactivation by animal sera and could transduce cerebral cortex and testis of mice by direct inoculation in vivo (Tani et al., 2003).",

More recently, baculoviruses have been used to mediate RNA interference (RNAi) using a novel hybrid promoter consisting of the CMV enhancer and polymerase III H1 promoter. The recombinant baculovirus was capable of suppressing expression of the target gene by 95% in cultured cells and by 82%in vivo in rat brain (Ong et al., 2005).

Therefore, the dense ECM surrounding the target cells constitutes a formidable barrier for in vivo baculovirus\u2010mediated gene therapy for tissue engineering. As such, ex vivo gene therapy may be a more appropriate choice in the context of bone and cartilage tissue engineering. For instance, differentiation of MSCs or progenitors toward a specific lineage pathway (e.g., osteogenic) may be modulated by ex vivo transduction with recombinant baculoviruses expressing appropriate growth factors (e.g., BMP\u20102). Given the efficient transduction of the partially differentiated progenitors, these cells may be transduced again with baculoviruses expressing identical (or different) factors with high efficiency, followed by seeding into scaffolds and implantation into animal models. The transduced cells may continue to express the appropriate factors in vivo, thereby stimulating cell differentiation and tissue (e.g., bone) regeneration in an autocrine or paracrine fashion.",

Hybrid baculovirus\u2013AAV vectors were derived with or without the AAV rep gene (whose gene products are essential for viral DNA replication and integration) cloned in different positions with respect to the baculovirus polyhedrin promoter. Transduction of 293 cells with the hybrid vector expressing the rep gene resulted in specific integration of ITR\u2010flanked DNA into the AAVS1 site of chromosome 19 (Palombo et al., 1998). A similar baculovirus\u2013AAV hybrid vector incorporating an ITR\u2010flanked luciferase gene under a neuron\u2010specific promoter was also employed for in vivo studies (Wang and Wang, 2005). Even without the help of rep gene expression, the viral vector was able to provide transgene expression for at least 90 days when tested in rat brains.

            "text": "Another drawback associated with baculoviruses as gene delivery vectors is that the nucleocapsid is enveloped with lipids derived from the host cell membrane. The envelope structure is essential for virus infectivity due to the anchored gp64 (Blissard and Wenz, 1992), but it also renders virus vulnerable to mechanical force and results in relatively low virus stability, a common problem also observed for other enveloped viruses such as retrovirus (Wu et al., 2000). Typically, baculoviral vectors are concentrated by ultracentrifugation after harvesting from cell culture and resuspended in PBS prior to use. However, ultracentrifugation often leads to significant loss of infectivity probably due to damage to viral envelopes. Ultracentrifugation also tends to result in virus aggregation (Barsoum, 1999). To alleviate these problems, we constructed a recombinant baculovirus with a hexahistidine (His6) tag displayed on the viral envelope, which enables virus purification by a simple immobilized metal affinity chromatography (IMAC) (Hu et al., 2003b). The IMAC methodology results in high purity (87%) and obviates the need for successive ultracentrifugation steps. However, the recovery yield in terms of infectious titer is lower than expected (<10%), probably because of damage to the viral envelope during the binding, washing, and elution steps. One possibility to alleviate virus loss during chromatographic purification steps is to display VSVG protein on the baculoviral envelope. Display of VSVG on the retrovirus envelope has been shown to enhance virus stability and the same strategy may be applied to enhancing baculovirus stability.",

When transduced cells were selected with the antibiotic G418, cell lines that stably maintain the foreign expression cassettes can be obtained at high frequency and exhibit stable, high\u2010level expression of the reporter gene for at least 25 passages. The frequency ranged from one clone in 39 transduced cells to one clone in 109 transduced cells, indicating that stable transduction is an efficient event. Stably transduced derivatives have been selected from a substantial number of cell types (e.g., CHO, Huh\u20107, HeLa, K562), suggesting that stable cell lines can be derived from any cell type that exhibits transient expression (Condreay et al., 1999).",

Although gene expression does not equate to virus replication, the possibility that other baculoviral promoters are also active in the transduced mammalian cells cannot be excluded. Whether and how expression of baculoviral proteins at basal levels in the mammalian cells induces immune responses and how this may influence cellular gene expression and physiological state requires further investigation.",

            "text": "The \u201cAchilles heel\u201d of gene therapy is that immune responses used to tackle wild\u2010type infections are activated against the vectors and/or the new transgene products (Thomas et al., 2003). Although baculoviruses were found capable of entering mammalian cells as early as in 1983 (Tjia 1983, Volkman 1983), the host response to baculovirus uptake, either in vitro or in vivo, was not evaluated until 1999 when Gronowski et al. (1999) reported that administration of baculoviruses in vitro induced the production of IFN\u2010\u03b1 and IFN\u2010\u03b2 from human and murine cell lines. The IFN\u2010stimulating activity of baculoviruses required live virus and was not due to the presence of viral RNA or DNA. Furthermore, administration of baculoviruses induced in vivo protection of mice from encephalomyocarditis virus infection (Gronowski et al., 1999). A subsequent study discovered that baculovirus transduction of cultured rat hepatocytes disrupted phenobarbital (PB) gene induction, a potent transcriptional activation event characteristic of highly differentiated hepatocytes, and repressed expression of the albumin gene (Beck et al., 2000). But neither cAMP nor PKA activities were affected by the virus. Baculovirus transduction also induced the expression of cytokines, such as TNF\u2010\u03b1, IL\u20101\u03b1, and IL\u20101\u03b2, in primary rat hepatocytes, however, TNF\u2010\u03b2, IL\u20102, IL\u20103, IL\u20104, IL\u20105, IL\u20106, and IFN\u2010\u03b3 were not detected in any of the baculovirus\u2010exposed hepatocytes (Beck et al., 2000). Airenne et al. (2000) found that in vivo administration of baculovirus to rabbit carotid artery resulted in signs of inflammation. More recently, Abe et al. (2003) demonstrated that inoculation of baculovirus induced the secretion of inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF\u2010\u03b1 and IL\u20106, in a murine macrophage cell line, RAW264.7. In the same study, they also demonstrated that intranasal inoculation with a wild\u2010type baculovirus elicited a strong innate immune response that protected mice from a lethal challenge of influenza virus (Abe et al., 2003). This protective immune response was induced via the TLR9/MyD88\u2010dependent signaling pathway (Abe et al., 2005). The production of inflammatory cytokines was severely reduced in peritoneal macrophages (PECs) and splenic CD11c+ dendritic cells (DCs) derived from mice deficient in MyD88 or TLR9 after stimulation with baculovirus. In contrast, a significant amount of IFN\u2010\u03b1 was still detectable in the PECs and DCs of these mice after stimulation with baculovirus, suggesting that a TLR9/MyD88\u2010independent signaling pathway may also participate in the production of IFN\u2010\u03b1 (Abe et al., 2005). The induction of cytokines required gp64, however, gp64 itself did not directly participate in the TLR\u2010mediated immune response. Instead, the authors concluded that internalization of viral DNA via gp64\u2010mediated membrane fusion and endosomal maturation which released the viral genome into TLR9\u2010expressing cellular compartments were necessary for the induction of innate responses (Abe et al., 2005). As mentioned earlier, membrane fusion and endosomal escape via gp64 are essential for nucleocapsid transport into the nucleus. Hence it appears that transgene expression may be coincident with induction of the TLR9/MyD88\u2010signaling pathway.",

            "text": "The immune response induced by baculoviruses makes it a promising candidate as a novel vaccine vehicle against infectious diseases (see chapter by van Oers, this volume, pp. 193\u2013253). The ability of baculoviruses to induce immune responses was first exploited by Aoki et al. (1999), who found that a recombinant baculovirus\u2010expressing glycoprotein gB of pseudorabies virus induced antibodies against gB protein in mice, suggesting that this recombinant baculovirus could serve as a vaccine candidate for pseudorabies. The feasibility of using baculoviruses as vaccine carriers was also demonstrated by Abe et al. (2003), who found that intranasal inoculation with a recombinant baculovirus expressing hemagglutinin (HA) of the influenza virus under the control of the CAG promoter elicited the innate immune response and provided mice with a high level of protection from a lethal challenge of influenza virus. The level of protection is dependent on the route of administration, and intranasal administration is considerably superior to intramuscular administration although the latter induces significantly higher anti\u2010HA IgG levels. More recently, Facciabene et al. (2004) demonstrated that intramuscular injection of a baculovirus expressing carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) induced a measurable anti\u2010CEA\u2013specific CD4+ T cell response. The immunogenic properties of baculoviruses are not restricted to CEA because intramuscular injection of another baculovirus (Bac\u2010E2) expressing the E2 glycoprotein of HCV induced an anti\u2010E2 CD8+ T cell response as well as the innate immune response such as natural killer (NK) cell cytolytic activity (Facciabene et al., 2004). Interestingly, when Bac\u2010E2 is pseudotyped to display VSVG on the envelope, the minimal dose required to elicit a measurable T cell response was tenfold less, indicating that the VSVG\u2010pseudotyped Bac\u2010E2 was a more potent vaccine carrier than the unmodified virus. This finding agrees with the previous statement that baculoviruses displaying VSVG provide for more efficient immunogen expression in transduced cells.",

            "text": "The broad range of mammalian cells permissive to baculovirus transduction, the nontoxic and nonreplicative nature, large packaging capacity, and ease of production make baculoviruses promising tools for gene therapy. Despite these advantages, baculoviruses are inactivated by serum complement, which restricts the application of baculovirus vectors for in vivo gene therapy. Additionally, the duration of transgene expression is generally short, thus baculoviruses may not be suited for long\u2010term gene therapy unless a hybrid vector capable of integrating the expression cassette into the host genome (e.g., baculovirus\u2013AAV) is employed. Nonetheless, baculoviruses, in conjunction with other viral vectors (e.g., adenoviral or lentiviral), may be administered sequentially to escape either preexisting or therapy\u2010induced antiviral immunity. Additionally, baculoviruses may serve as delivery vectors for triggering RNA interference. Baculoviruses carrying tumor\u2010suppressor or suicide genes may also be used in combination with other treatments for cancer therapy (Song 2001, Stanbridge 2003). Given the highly efficient gene transfer to chondrocytes and MSCs, baculoviruses expressing appropriate growth factors may be used for ex vivo genetic modification of cells prior to transplantation into animals. The growth factors, acting in either an autocrine or a paracrine fashion, potentially accelerate tissue regeneration in vivo. Unlike the treatment of chronic disease, it is neither necessary nor desirable for transgene expression to persist beyond the few weeks or months needed to achieve healing (Huard 2003, Lieberman 2002). As a result, long\u2010term transgene expression is not critical in tissue engineering. Hence, the combination of baculovirus\u2010mediated gene therapy and tissue engineering may hold great promise. Of course, to address the safety issues of employing baculoviruses in gene therapy, the DNA integration, expression of baculovirus endogenous genes, and baculovirus\u2010induced immune responses should be investigated.",
