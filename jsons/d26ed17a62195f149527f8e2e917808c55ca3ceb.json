Our findings differ from patients with dengue virus infection, in which both serum LysoPC and LysoPE were reduced (Cui, et al., 2013) . The high level of LysoPC in CAP patients can be related to specific host changes in pneumonia. High plasma levels of LysoPC in CAP patients may be caused by the release of LysoPC from surfactant during lung injury (Arbibe, et al., 1998) . LysoPC may also contribute to direct toxicity to the lung (Grossmann, et al., 1999; Vlaar, et al., 2010; Zhou, et al., 2014) . However, a previous study showed that the plasma levels of LysoPC were lower among fatal than non-fatal patients, and low levels of LysoPC was postulated to be associated with dysregulated inflammatory response (Cho, et al., 2015) . In our study, the plasma levels of LysoPC were significantly lower in high-risk CAP cases, and were also lower in fatal CAP cases than those of non-fatal CAP cases, although not reaching statistical significance (Table 3 ).

For example, lactosylceramide is a mediator of inflammatory response triggered by Pneumocystis (Evans, et al., 2012) . In vitro, influenza virus infection induces elevated levels of hexosylceramides (Tanner, et al., 2014) . Inhibition of glycosphingolipid synthesis has been associated with reduced pulmonary inflammation in mice challenged with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (Dechecchi, et al., 2011) . Sphingomyelin is a structural component of cell membranes (Maceyka and Spiegel, 2014) . In mice, sphingomyelin synthase 2 (SMS2), which catalyzes the synthesis of sphingomyelin, is activated during LPS-induced lung injury, and inhibition of SMS2 attenuated lung injury and endothelial barrier disruption (Anjum, et al., 2012) . This mice study suggested that sphingomyelin is important in lung injury, and the higher level of sphingomyelins in our CAP cases is compatible with this hypothesis. However, other studies suggest that high levels of sphingomyelin may be protective. Stringer et al showed that patients with acute lung injury had lower levels of sphingomyelin when compared to healthy controls, although the absolute difference is small (Stringer, et al., 2011) . The levels of L-palmitoylcarnitine were significantly higher in CAP cases than non-CAP controls. L-palmitoylcarnitine facilitates the transport of long-chain fatty acids from the cytoplasm into the mitochondria, where fatty acid beta-oxidation takes place. During acute lung injury, fatty acid metabolism is disturbed (Guo, et al., 2014) . A previous study also showed that high levels of L-palmitoylcarnitine were associated with poorer prognosis in patients with chronic heart failure (Ueland, et al., 2013) .
