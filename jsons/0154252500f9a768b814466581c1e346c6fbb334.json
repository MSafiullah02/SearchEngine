The ability of this agent to be transmitted by blood transfusion has not been documented, although viral RNA has been detected in serum. Exposure to treatment with riboflavin and ultraviolet light (R + UV) reduces blood-borne pathogens while maintaining blood product quality.

            "text": "Despite the recent emergence of this pandemic, community spread of COVID-19 is well recognized but transfusion transmission has yet to be reported (4, 6) . In the early days of the pandemic experts debated whether asymptomatic transmission was possible, a necessary precondition for transmission through transfusion given rigorous donor screening practices (7) . That question; however, is no longer debated as the degree of community transmission in Italy and now New York have accelerated despite symptomatic screening. COVID-19 is characterized by viral shedding which starts during an initial asymptomatic phase that can last more than 14 days, followed by active disease and post-resolution viral shedding that can persist for up to 37 days (7) . Furthermore, findings of viral RNA in multiple bodily fluids tested including blood raises considerable concern regarding the safety of convalescent plasma (8) . In one study, viral RNA was detected in the blood of 96.8% of affected patients (9) . While SARS-CoV, the causative agent of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak of 2002 and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) have not been documented to cause transfusion-transmitted disease, those pathogens resulted in higher mortality, but lower infectivity due to a lower binding efficiency with the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) receptors, respectively. By contrast, SARS-CoV-2 binding strength to the ACE2 receptor is higher, suggesting a cause for the greater propensity for human to human transmission (10, 11) . Observations regarding the absence of documented transfusion transmission of SARS and MERS may not be a good indication of whether COVID-19 poses a threat to the blood supply.",

Pathogen reduction was also effective for whole blood units, suggesting that the riboflavin and UV method can provide a measure of safety against this enveloped, positive-sense, single strand RNA virus. In a rapidly moving environment in which cases are rising by over 15,000 cases per day at the time of writing and major cities across the country struggling to contain the spread of the pandemic, security of the blood supply is in serious question. A pathogen reduction technology would provide a measure of security that would allow donations from asymptomatic adults to continue to support the critically ill requiring transfusions. Recovered patients with antibody response could provide convalescent plasma to help protect health care workers exposed to who will be needed to contain the crisis. Passive immunity could also assist high risk patients and the critically ill to clear viral loads. Previous studies have demonstrated that R + UV PRT is a potential tool to mitigate the risk of infection from convalescent plasma. An in vitro study conducted with Ebola Virus (EBOV) in serum and whole blood from non-human primates with Ebola disease demonstrated that antibody titers were maintained within protective thresholds after R+UV PRT (15) .",

To date, the differences in the two strains appear to be related to infectivity and the impact on conferred immunity is not clear. In the setting of this rapidly expanding pandemic, a significant number of severely ill patients, and unclear transmissibility in blood, experts are advising caution.

The potential of SARS-CoV-2 to be transmitted through transfusions is unknown. The SARS-CoV-2 virus was detected in blood at very low levels and no documented cases of transfusion transmission have been reported in the literature(13). Despite this, the World Health Organization and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommended deferring donors based on risk of SARS due to a theoretical risk of transmission(8). The current novel coronavirus pandemic exhibits higher viral loads in blood samples and far greater human-to-human spread. Early in the course of the pandemic in the United States, FDA suggested a 28-day deferral for travel-associated risk; however, with over 85 thousand cases at the time of writing and no states free of cases, this strategy is no longer tenable.M.B. Pagano et al. described their experience with adapting to pandemic conditions in Washington State and stated that blood donations fell precipitously as the number of cases rose exponentially",

Contamination with new, emerging agents is determined via direct testing or is extrapolated based on the behaviors of similar agents treated under these conditions. Methods employed include ultrafiltration, heat inactivation and solventdetergent treatment, all of which have been found to significantly reduce pathogen contaminants when used alone or in combination in processing of donated plasma for fractionation.Plasma fractionation techniques are not suitable for cellular components or single donation products such as Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP) and Frozen Plasma-24 Hours (FP-24) units. Recently, however, new pathogen reduction methods have emerged for the treatment of plasma, platelets and whole blood products that can be used for treatment of single or pooled donations such as buffy coat platelets.Riboflavin is a photosensitizer that, in the presence of UV excitation, can induce changes to DNA and RNA via electron transfer chemistry and reactive oxygen species generation. These changes result in the inability of treated agents to replicate.
