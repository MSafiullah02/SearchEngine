Until recently the scant literature focused on the digital divide suffered by minority communities (DTI, 2000) , or identity tourism by white people masquerading as minority individuals (Nakamura, 2002a) . Recent accounts in the United States have highlighted new forms of online cultural practice initiated by minority groups themselves (Kolko, Nakamura and Rodman, 2000; Lee and Wong, 2003) . However, there is still no extensive analysis of how ethnic minorities in Britain are starting to shape the Internet, contesting the terms on which their identities are represented in the public domain.",

The work of Barry Wellman and colleagues suggests that community has been redefined rather than replaced by the Internet. The medium's ability to connect across space enables the simultaneous, but partial, involvement of users in a wide range of weak ties (Granovetter, 1973) . For Wellman the immediacy of the Internet facilitates greater 'personalization' -the tailoring of information retrieval and dissemination to highly particular preferences. Rather than expressing core group solidarities, communities become person-to-person interchanges, part of a repertoire of multiple associations, a 'networked individualism' (Wellman, 2001; Wellman et al., 2003) .",

Critics such as Ien Ang (2001) and Aihwa Ong (2003) have interrogated the regression to racial essentialism they see underlying much of the Internet activity stimulated by this migration. Ong's focus is 'the translocal publics constituted by professionals online (. . .) directly engaged in the production of global ethnicities' (Ong, 2003: 92) . For Ong this is exemplified by the web site directed at migrant Chinese worldwide: www.huaren.org. This site of the World Huaren Federation seeks to address the global Chinese diaspora as a unified collective, bound together by an affinity to mainland China.",

Another came in spring 2005 when site users responded to the death of Mr Huang Chen in Wigan, attacked by local youths outside his takeaway business. As one message stated, 'The fact is that these kind of incidents strike a chord with the vast majority of British born Chinese, since most of us grew up with takeaways and more often than not some form of racial abuse' (posted by 'eskargot', British born Chinese forum, 24 th June 2005). Taken together the messages constitute a collective witness to the experience of growing up as Chinese in Britain (see Parker, 1995; Song, 1999) . Underlying the sentiments expressed are broader estimations of social status, prospects for social justice and the necessity of struggle in the face of continued inequalities. When questioned by E-mail about their participation, site users eloquently summarised what the site has meant to them: I think web sites like this will make British Born Chinese more confident. It gives them a 'unity' with others where they know they are not alone and that they can receive support and advice from people who can sympathise with their special circumstance ('Lam', site user, response to E-mail questioning)",

However, when on the grounds of wanting to express a deeper affiliation to Islam she wished to wear the jilbab, a garment covering the whole body, she was prohibited and did not attend school thereafter. The High Court accepted the school's view that it had already provided for Muslim pupils by allowing the shalwar kameez, and did not want a further variation of its uniform to become a symbol of being 'more Muslim' (Independent 16 th June 2004).",

Vivid recollections of crucial biographical moments evoke advice and opinion on matters such as how to cope with racism at school and work, the details of religious practice, the prospects for social mobility in British society. These open forums can encourage particularly intense self-disclosure, fostered by the sense of intimacy from a distance distinctive to electronic communication. For example, the British Born Chinese site forum 'The Shoulder' regularly deals New ethnicities online 585 with very personal dilemmas such as having non-Chinese partners, the consequences of parents selling the family catering business, and the prospects of working in East Asia.

In addition, there is very little evidence of dialogue with other ethnic groups on either site, with the danger that 'narrow band imaginings (. . .) hardly aid the cause of genuinely democratic deliberation' (Goodin, 2003: 70) . Further steps are needed to turn these web sites into enduring counterpublics, projecting oppositional voices into a public realm 'in which free, open and responsive dialogical interaction takes place' (Bohman, 2004: 144) . This would require making spaces for the exchange of opinions into more systematic interventions in decision-making processes.Yet given the novelty of the technology, it would be harsh to judge these forums by the inappropriately rigorous standard of a Habermasian public sphere (Habermas, 1989) and then find them wanting.",

Existing campaigning organisations increasingly have their events highlighted in messages on the British Born Chinese web site. In June 2005 users of the discussion board highlighted a public forum on anti-Chinese racism held at the House of Lords, and organised by the Chinese civil rights group Min Quan. Mainstream political institutions have begun to use the barfiCulture site to communicate with the British Asian population. In spring 2004 the British government's Electoral Commission used the barfiCulture site to conduct a survey of young British Asians' views on voting and political participation. The links between the new social institutions of the Internet and established channels of political action must be extended if these emerging media networks are to reach beyond their enthusiastic, but marginalised, participants.",
