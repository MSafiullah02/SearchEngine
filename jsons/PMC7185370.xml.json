Our planet is experiencing about 500 natural disasters annually compared with 120 in the early 1980s [1]. Similarly, public health emergencies such as pandemic disasters pose a similar threat to our globe [2]. The Spanish flu pandemic of 1918-1919, for instance, infected one-third of the world's population and killed an astonishing 50 million people [2]. Since this pandemic, the deadliest in recorded history, several other disease outbreaks have swept through the world, including Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003, influenza A (H1N1) or the so-called swine flu in 2009, and the most recent Ebola in 2014. These events could easily overwhelm all components of the affected communities including the healthcare systems.",

For instance, 21% of SARS victims were healthcare workers, and some of them even transmitted the disease to their family members [3].

It can also be used to predict the attitude of people in less common events like terrorist attacks, pandemics, or public health emergencies [6].",

ALS (advanced life support) services are paid and provided state-wide by the counties [16]. Both Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs) and paramedics were included in the study sample. To obtain access to interview participants, the Office of EMS in the State of Delaware, USA, was contacted and agreed to facilitate connections with appropriate interviewees for this study. To recruit interviewees, the primary researcher contacted the coordinators from different EMS stations asking them for site visit permission and logistics to perform the interviews with the on-duty EMS providers. A purposive sampling strategy, a method widely used in qualitative studies [13,17], was used to select interviewees for the study. Early participants were randomly selected from the accessible EMS stations to conduct one or two interviews at a time. Generally, three to four potential participants were available for interview if there is no active call. Later in the interview process, the primary researcher used a criterion purposive sampling strategy to recruit information-rich participants to fulfill different characteristics [17]. That is, the selection of interviewees included participants from different potential confounders such as job title, work status, gender, marital status, and years of experience as displayed in Table 1\n. Participants who agreed to take part in the study were asked to read and sign an informed consent about the potential risk of participation before starting the interview.",

The interviews were conducted in the EMS stations with the on-duty EMS providers during their scheduled shifts. This was the most convenient time for participants given the fact that participants could be dispatched to a call at any time during the interview, which in fact had happened. The primary researcher was able to conduct the interviews in isolated spaces within the EMS stations with minimal disruptions and noises.

Given that the bulk of the interview questions were focused on comparing day-to-day operations, natural disasters, and disease outbreaks, one of the main coding methods used was versus coding [19]. Each code was labeled with a descriptive definition to keep track of the exact meaning of these codes. After coding transcripts in their entirety, the codes were refined to merge close or similar ones and to start the second cycle of coding. In the second cycle of coding, a thorough review of the quotations in each code was performed, and the codes were classified into groups and categories where each category has relevant codes. Themes were developed from the views of participants within these categories along with the notes and memos [19].",

EMS providers receive a considerable amount of training on response to disasters using the Incident Command System (ICS). They are trained to provide search and rescue operations, triage, and emergency care depending on the type of disaster. However, when it comes to day-to-day operations, the majority of the EMS calls are non-emergency, or non-life threatening calls, meaning that patients need minimal care and transport to the appropriate care facilities [23]. To some extent, this type of work is routine and perhaps boring to providers. As mentioned by one of the participants, the majority of their calls \u201cdon't necessarily need all the training that we had,\u201d because patients in these calls \u201cjust don't feel well\u201d. However, during natural disasters, they like to help \u201cthe most amount of people in the most amount of danger.\u201d Therefore, EMS providers prefer to provide care for acute cases of sick and injured victims, which is the kind of work that they enjoy and are trained to do.",

For instance, participants emphasized that transportation and other infrastructure issues that might occur during natural disasters could hinder their ability to come to work. That being said, if EMS providers are able to come to work, participants mentioned that they will show up as expected. This view is congruent with a study by Ref. [21]Smith et al.

The findings of the study provide a motivation to the EMS organizations to consider measures that can better facilitate the safety and well-being of EMS providers. Although this system has not been tested at a large-scale disease outbreak for decades, it would be very beneficial to implement or coordinate the implementation of a large-scale drill or exercise where all stakeholders become involved. This helps in testing the current preparedness of the EMS systems and explores areas that may need improvements such as the level of EMS training and the ability of providers\u2019 families to function well during extended disaster responses. Doing so will ultimately benefit individual EMS providers, their agencies, and the communities they serve.",

While the 2009 swine flu was a pandemic that affected almost every country in the world due to its ease of transmission, it was not virulent and in turn, did not scare healthcare providers including the EMS. The 2014 Ebola outbreak was very contagious and virulent and resulted in many illnesses and deaths. The outbreak impacted the West African region and resulted in many infections and deaths among healthcare providers. yet, in the U.S., where the study was conducted, Ebola consisted of less than 10 cases, only two of which were from local contagion. This is quite different from a potential outbreak of something like SARS or H5N1 (avian flu), which could affect hundreds of thousands of people or more. This would mean that all EMS providers would likely come in contact with victims of the disease, not just a dozen special cases. The broad epidemic, then, would present very different dynamics for EMS personnel, and in turn, may reveal different behaviors.",

Research studies show that healthcare workers are generally \u2014except for nuclear events\u2014least willing to work during epidemics [30]. While it is difficult to draw a conclusion about the real behavior of EMS providers during disease outbreaks using perception studies [6], EMS providers in this sample are generally dedicated to their job, and willing to come and perform the duties that are expected of them. For natural disasters\u2019 response, they even showed excitement and thrill due to challenges and out-of-routine type work. For disease outbreak situations, while not as thrilled compared to natural disasters, they still showed a high willingness to come to work.",
