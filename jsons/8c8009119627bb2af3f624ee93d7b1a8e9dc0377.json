Then, in brief, daily S&P 500 index option quotes are combined with estimates of a risk-aversion parameter \u03ba to develop the ERP term structures. We briefly review how that works in Sec. 2 below. Further computational details may be found in Appendix 2 here and the Lewis article.",

It is well-known that when the market gets very stressed by something, VIX rises and the whole VIX term structure 'inverts'. In other words, short-term (risk-neutral) volatility expectations rise above long-term ones. Correspondingly, the ERP term structure also strongly inverts. During the pandemic, this ERP inversion first happened circa Feb 24, 2020; it remained inverted through the end of the study data on Apr 15, 2020.",

But, I was surprised, quantitatively, by the extraordinary heights reached by the short-term ERP's during mid-March 2020. For example, the March 12 term structure ( Fig. 10) shows the short-dated (one day horizon) ERP reaching a mid-point estimate of approximately 540% per year! For comparison, long-run ERP estimates typically lie in the 3-6% per year range. Indeed, 3-6% characterized the pandemic-period US market through mid-February. ERP levels as high as the March 12 ones may be record-setting. To say for sure requires applying the current methodology to option quotes during the 2008-2009 Financial Crisis -this has not yet been done.",

            "text": "Wuhan, China was placed under quarantine on Jan 23, 2020, with rail and services suspended. Two days earlier, on Jan 21, the first US case was identified in Washington state -a man in his 30's who had returned from a trip to Wuhan. Fig 2 shows the estimated ERP term structure. It's within typical long-run ERP estimates of 3-6% per year: the US equity market was not concerned. Feb 23, 2020 marks the end of this segment with start of lock-downs in Italy. As seen in Fig. 6 , the ERP chart for the next day, the market is now definitely paying attention. The S&P500 has fallen 4.7% from its record peak of 3386.15 on Feb 19, and the CBOE's VIX index has risen to 25.03. Fig 6 shows the estimated ERP term structure. It's become strongly inverted with the short-term ERP (the \"required return\") rising to about 40%. Note the long end of the curve, representing the Dec 21, 2022 maturity -about 2.8 years away. It's around 8%, slightly higher but not too far from the longer-term value in the previous plots. In general, VIX's above 40 are a sign of a very high level of systematic market stress (see Fig. 17 ). The associated ERP term structure (Fig. 8) significantly steepens from our last plot, showing an estimated short-term required return of 100-130 percent per annum. The week of Mar 9-13 is very ugly on many fronts. COVID-19 cases are rising exponentially in Europe and the US. In the absence of mitigation, there are predictions of millions of deaths to occur in the US before so-called 'herd immunity' is achieved. A vaccine is predicted to be at least 18 months away, and not certain even then. On Thurs Mar 12, 2020, the VIX index closes at 75.5% and the short-term (1-day) annualized ERP reaches 500-600% (see Fig. 8 ). Although hard to discern in the chart, the ERP over the longest term (2 3 4 years) has risen to approximately 17% annualized. Credit markets are highly stressed. By the end of Mar 16-20 week, stresses begin to ease somewhat: see Fig. 12 . The short-term ERP estimate ended the week at 200-250%, the lowest of the week. VIX ended at 66. What prompted the ease? Prospective stimulus likely helped. Also, the U. Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) was gaining influence. 4 Their earliest predictions (Mar 25), based upon curve fitting to the Wuhan experience, suggested cumulative US deaths to total 38,000-162,000 through Aug 2020 -premised on lock-downs. These estimates were significantly lower than the previous 'millions' of others (without mitigation), and not terribly disproportionate to the annual mortality from the flu. Indeed, as time passed, the IHME US death estimates were tightened and lowered: 48,000-123,000 at this writing (late April 2020), with 54,000 actual deaths to date. ",

These were treated as distinct expirations because times were measured to 15 min accuracy. Here, for simplicity, for such dual expirations, only the PM options were included. However, certainly the AM options were included here for any expiration when those were the sole options expiring. Also for simplicity, all times T here (in years), were simply measured as T=(days)/365, where days was the integer number of days from the trade date to the expiration date.",

One change was that I only included 50% of the put-call pairs: those closest to the money. For very short-dated expirations, while the regression method produces very plausible forward prices (which are key), the inferred interest rate and dividend yield are rather erratic, often negative. This erratic effect was lessoned by the 50% inclusion (the previous study using 100%). The previous study showed that two different cost-of-carry methods will produce almost identical ERP's as long as the inferred forward prices are similar.",

I sought to achieve my secondary objective by switching the number of Gaussian components from N=4 to N=5, or making other adjustments such as introducing a minimum bid on put quotes higher than the 0.05 non-zero minimum characteristic of SPX options. Here, for both simplicity and efficiency, I fixed on N=5 Gaussian components for the entire study and always included every out-of-the-money option quote with both a non-zero bid and non-zero ask. I declared these to be \"simplified rules\", and confirmed that all the ERP's of my previous study were reproduced to 3 good digits under my simplified rules.",

Optimizer parameters consisted of the PrecisionGoal (PG=4), the maximum number of optimizer steps (MAXSTEPS=600), and a scaling parameter (sigMULT=1.2). This last one fixed the upper limit of the allowed fitted volatility to be sigMULT \u00d7 IVMAX, where the second term was the highest implied volatility observed at that expiration. On a few expirations, if the OutStats looked particularly poor, I would try a rerun with MAXSTEPS=1000, or PG=5 or sigMULT=1.4. Typically, the fit would improve, but with the ERP either unchanged or only changing slightly.",
