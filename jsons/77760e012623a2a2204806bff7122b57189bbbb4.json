Ste24 possesses a unique \"\u03b1-barrel\" structure consisting of seven transmembrane (TM) \u03b1-helices encircling a large intramembranous cavity (~14 000 \u00c5 3 ). The catalytic zinc, coordinated via a HExxH\u2026E/H motif characteristic of gluzincin ZMPs, is positioned at one of the cavity's bases. The interrelationship between Ste24 as a gluzincin, a long-studied class of soluble ZMPs, and as a novel cavity-containing integral membrane protein protease has been minimally explored to date. Informed by homology to wellcharacterized soluble, gluzincin ZMPs, we develop a model of Ste24 that provides a conceptual framework for this enzyme family, suitable for development and interpretation of structure/function studies. The model consists of an interfacial, zinccontaining \"ZMP Core\" module surrounded by a \"ZMP Accessory\" module, both capped by a TM helical \"\u03b1-barrel\" module of as yet unknown function. Multiple sequence alignment of 58 Ste24 orthologs revealed 38 absolutely conserved residues, apportioned unequally among the ZMP Core (18), ZMP Accessory (13), and \u03b1-barrel (7) modules. This Tripartite Architecture representation of Ste24 provides a unified image of this enzyme family.",

            "text": "Proteases, abundant enzymes across all forms of life, conduct a remarkably broad range of biological functions. 1 Approximately 2% of genome-encoded mammalian proteins are proteases. 2 Due to their abundance and copious biological roles, protease dysfunction can lead to deleterious health consequences. 1 Proteases are targeted to virtually all cellular compartments from cytosolic/luminal space to the membranes of organelles and the cell exterior. Because of their \"gatekeeping\" status, peripheral and integral membrane protein proteases play further specialized and vital roles in metabolic and signaling pathways. [3] [4] [5] Ste24 enzymes, a family of integral membrane proteins, function as zinc metalloproteases (ZMPs) and are found in all eukaryotic organisms. 6 The first Ste24 family member, Ste24p (where \"p\" is an abbreviation for protein), was discovered and characterized in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, where it is involved in posttranslational modification of the peptide-derived a-factor mating pheromone. [7] [8] [9] Nascent a-factor processing involves three proteolytic cleavages, two of which Ste24p is competent to perform. 6 One Ste24p cleavage occurs between a farnesylated Cys and the sequence Val-Ile-Ala, which form a C-terminal \"CAAX box\" motif (C is Cys; A is typically an aliphatic amino acid; and X is one of several amino acids less restricted in characteristics). 10 Ste24p is capable of, though not required for, carrying out the CAAX box cleavage, 9 and uniquely required for one of the two other nonprenylated site cleavages. 8 The ZMP protease Axlp, or its homolog Ste23p, is required for ultimately completing a-factor maturation via cleavage of the remaining site. 11 The human HsSte24 enzyme, also known as FACE-1 and ZMPSTE24, is localized to the endoplasmic reticulum and the inner nuclear membrane. 6, 12 The earliest functional characterization of HsSte24 demonstrated its role in the processing of prelamin A to mature intermediate filament protein lamin A. 13, 14 Lamins provide mechanical stability to the nuclear envelope and function as scaffolds for DNA repair and replication complexes. 15, 16 Prelamin A is a CAAX box-containing substrate that undergoes two proteolytic cleavages, at the CAAX box and an N-terminal site. 17 Both cleavages can be performed by HsSte24, with a unique requirement for HsSte24 cleavage of the nonprenylated site (analogous to Ste24p).

Protein interaction studies using the IFITM3 protein as \"bait\" discovered HsSte24 as a downstream effector. 31, 32 Strikingly, overexpression of HsSte24 in IfitmDel cells (all ifitm genes deleted) yielded the same reduced viral infection phenotype as seen in IFITM-expressing cells, suggesting that HsSte24 is the antiviral \"causative agent.\" 31 Also, catalytically inactive HsSte24 in these experiments produced the same results, indicating that proteolytic function is not required.",

Additionally, functional complementation between human and yeast Ste24 orthologs has been established in vivo where HsSte24 rescues defects in a-factor biogenesis associated with Ste24p knockout yeast (ste24\u0394). 9 Crystal structures of yeast (Saccharomyces mikatae; SmSte24) 33 and human Ste24 (HsSte24) reveal these two Ste24 structures to be highly similar (RMSD of C \u03b1 atoms 1.7 \u00c5). 23, 35, 37 The structure of Ste24, as exemplified by SmSte24 (PDB: 4IL3), possesses a striking seven-transmembrane (TM) helical \"\u03b1-barrel\" structure encapsulating a voluminous reaction cavity (~14 000 \u00c5 3 ; Figure 1A ). The zinc-coordinated active site is localized at one \"end\" of the approximately cylindrical reaction cavity ( Figure 1A ,B). Ste24 is associated with the gluzincin subclan of Zincin ZMPs (MEROPS 38 designation MA[E]), which use a glutamate, Glu390 in SmSte24, or histidine residue as the third ligand coordinating the zinc atom (ie, HExxH\u2026E/H) ( Figure 1B ,C). [39] [40] [41] Despite the status of the Ste24 family as a gluzincin, structural homology to and sequence conservation with gluzincins (or particular subsets of gluzincin families) has been scantly investigated. Such an analysis is especially important for identifying conserved structural elements and catalytically essential residues, in addition to the HExxH\u2026E/H gluzincin motif, which form the complete Ste24 active-site. Furthermore, the description of Ste24 as a gluzincin describes only a portion of this large, multidomain, membrane-inserted enzyme.",

Residues contributing to the catalytic (C) and specificity (S1 0 ) functions are explicitly labeled, shown as sticks, and their respective surfaces shown.

B, Stereo view of the Ste24 gluzincin structural motif. The image is generated from the left-hand orientation of the Ste24 molecule as seen in panel A. Ste24 possesses the gluzincin 297 HExxH 301 \u2026E 390 consensus sequence motif located at the base of TM helices VI and VII. Residues His297, His301, and Glu390 coordinate the zinc ion, with Glu298 acting as the general base during turnover.37,40 C, Topology diagram of Ste24. The color-coding of the ribbon diagram in panels A and B is maintained. TM \u03b1-helices are labeled I-VII. Two, large membrane interfacial regions flank the coordinated zinc ion: the mixed \u03b1-helix-\u03b2-sheet Loop 5 Domain (L5D) located between helix V and helix VI, and the \u03b1-helical C-terminal Domain (CTD) Use of the entire SmSte24 monomer (Figure 1A) as a search model for structurally homologous soluble gluzincins failed because the majority of the DALI-identified structures recognized the TM \u03b1-helices of SmSte24 as opposed to the region immediately surrounding the gluzincin motif. Therefore, a truncated SmSte24 \"gluzincinonly\" search model, including the L5D, the CTD, and portions of TM \u03b1-helices VI (residues 292-301) and VII (residues 390-408) was constructed and input to the DALI server (http://ekhidna2.biocenter.helsinki.fi/dali/). The query identified soluble homologs belonging to three gluzincin families: thermolysin (M4), neprilysin (M13), and an uncharacterized ZMP from Geobacter sulfurreducens (M48)(Figure 2A), whose active sites all possess homology with Ste24 (Figure 2B). Structural homology of Ste24 to M13 gluzincins has not been previously reported, while homology to M4 and M48 gluzincins has previously been established.33,37 (The ZMP from G sulfurreducens is in the M48B subfamily, MA(E)/M48B, and is the only full-length structure of a non-M48A subfamily member.)",

The ZMP Core module of thermolysin (M4) does not possess this structural \"hat\" (Figure 2A). Based upon these observations, we propose a modular Tripartite Architecture for the Ste24 family of integral membrane protein ZMPs consisting of: (a) a largely cytoplasmic active-site \"ZMP Core\" module, (b) a mixed soluble/membrane-interfacial \"ZMP Accessory\" module (in close apposition to the ZMP Core module), and (c) a TM heptahelical \"\u03b1-barrel\" module (of currently undetermined/unknown function) adjacent to the ZMP Core and ZMP Accessory modules (Figure 3C,D).",

The structures are sorted from least similar (top) to most similar (bottom) based on the Dali similarity or Z score between the Ste24 search model and the identified structures. Inspection of output from the Dali server 42 revealed thermolysin (PDB 1LNF, Dali Z score 3.6), neprilysin (PDB 1DMT, Dali Z score 4.9), and the ZMP from G sulfurreducens (PDB 3C37, Dali Z score 6.3) as soluble, gluzincin structures most homologous to Ste24. The functional annotations for the selected gluzincins thermolysin (M4), neprilysin (M13), and the G sulfurreducens ZMP (M48) are based on MEROPS 38 database assignments. Conserved \u03b1-helical (containing the HExxE\u2026E motif residues shown as sticks) and \u03b2-strand elements are highlighted and represent a canonical gluzincin structure motif. Note the neprilysin and G sulfurreducens ZMP structures carry an extra domain situated above this motif. Closer inspection of each individual core region identifies residues (shown as sticks) essential for optimal substrate cleavage (indicated by C) and specificity for the side chain of the amino acid immediately C-terminal to the scissile bond (indicated by S1 0 ) where the prime ( 0 ) designation indicates enzyme specificity sites for amino acid side-chain(s) C-terminal to the scissile bond.65 ZMP residues participating in peptide bond cleavage (ie, catalytic) are absolutely conserved and positioned among the three gluzincins. ZMP residues involved in substrate recognition (ie, side-chain specificity) are chemically conserved and positioned orthogonally to the catalytic ZMP residues forming a sandwich-like motif. (B) Putative catalytic and specificity sites within Ste24. Ste24 TM \u03b1-helices V, VI and the \u03b23-strand of the L5D form the equivalent canonical gluzincin structure motif found in the homologous gluzincin structures. As in the neprilysin and G sulfurreducens ZMP structures, Ste24 possesses an extra domain, in this case a transmembrane (TM) heptahelical \"\u03b1-barrel,\" situated above the gluzincin motif. Investigation of this region in Ste24 implicates additional residues of the \u03b13 element of the L5D and the \u03b16/\u03b17-helices of the CTD as important for catalytic and specificity roles. Note that the four catalytic residues Asn263, Ala264, His434, and Arg440 (SmSte24 numbering) are absolutely conserved and identically positioned among all four gluzincins scale with our current level of understanding of the functions of these domains: 23%, 10% and 3%, respectively. Inspection of SmSte24 and HsSte24 structures alongside those of soluble, homologous gluzincins allows assignment of putative roles for these 38 absolutely conserved amino acid residues(Table 1), which are mapped onto the Tripartite Architecture model in topological and three-dimensional representations (Figure 4 and Figure S2, respectively). Based on predicted catalytic (C) or substrate (S) binding roles in the ZMP Core domain, or structural roles of the ZMP Accessory domain, we have identified 17, absolutely conserved Ste24 residues that share conservation with all (or a subset) of the identified gluzincin homologs. None of these positions are located in the \u03b1-barrel module (Figure 4 and Figure S2). The presence of the majority (31/38,~82%) of absolutely conserved residues being in the Core ZMP and Accessory ZMP modules, and the ability of most of these (17/31,~55%) to be rationalized by comparison to soluble gluzincins, is consistent with and supports our Tripartite Model modular assignments based on structural homology. 4 | DISCUSSION 4.1 | Bioinformatic and structural analyses yield a functionally insightful modular Tripartite Architecture of the Ste24 enzyme family A structure-based search was used to identify gluzincin ZMPs homologous to the Ste24 family. The search identified thermolysin (M4), neprilysin (M13), and the G sulfurreducens ZMP (M48). These results enabled us to develop a modular Tripartite Architecture model for Ste24 (",

            "text": "A similar proline-containing structural motif is observed in neprilysin (M13) and G sulfurreducens ZMP (M48). The \u03b17-helix contains the catalytic Arg440 of Ste24.The Leu437 side chain is part of a hydrophobic, leucine-zipper motif between ZMP Core module helices \u03b15 and \u03b17 of the CTD. The use of a hydrophobic, leucine-zipper like motif is also conserved in neprilysin (M13) and G sulfurreducens ZMP (M48) structures. Ste24 and neprilysin share an additional conserved feature in this region. In Ste24, a loop element between TM \u03b1-helices I and II contributes further hydrophobic residues near the \u03b15/\u03b17 interface, with the absolutely conserved Pro47 residing within this loop; in neprilysin (M13), a perpendicular \u03b1-helical element contributes residues fulfilling the same role.4.4 | Residues in the ZMP Core and ZMP Accessory modules coordinate the L5D \u03b23-strand and surrounding turns A \u03b2-strand positioned on a side of the zinc-centered active-site is a common structural feature among ZMPs and donates catalytically essential residues (both side-chain and main-chain moieties) for proteolysis 39,50 (Figure 2). In Ste24, the L5D \u03b23-strand of the ZMP Core module fulfills this role, and is \"catalytically aligned\" by the ZMP Core module (residues of the \u03b13-helix of the L5D,Figure 3C,D) and by the ZMP Accessory module (residues of the \u03b23/4-turn and \u03b24-strand of the L5D \u03b2-sheet, TM \u03b1-helix III/IV loop, and the TM \u03b1-helix II (Figure 3D). The \u03b22/\u03b23-turn of the L5D is a nexus of coordinated molecular interfaces from multiple structural elements; interacting absolutely conserved residues include Asp280 and Thr281 (\u03b13-helix of the L5D) of the ZMP Core module, and Tyr65 (TM \u03b1-helix II), Gly152 and Asn154 (TM \u03b1-helix III/IV loop) of the ZMP Accessory module (Figure 4). Residues Asp280 and Thr281, in the L5D \u03b13-helix of the ZMP Core module, form hydrogen bonds with side-chain and mainchain residues of the \u03b22/\u03b23-turn, respectively. Asp280 forms a hydrogen bond with the Ser256 hydroxyl-bearing side chain. His261, conserved in 56 of 58 orthologs (Figure S1), forms two hydrogen bonds with absolutely conserved Ste24 residues: via its backbone carbonyl to Thr281 (ZMP Core Module) and via its sidechain to Tyr65 (ZMP Accessory module). (The remaining two orthologs have a glutamate at this position, suggesting that a hydrogen bond at this location may be conserved in the Ste24 family [-Figure S1]). The TM \u03b1-helix III/IV loop contacts the \u03b22/\u03b23-turn, forming a short \u03b2-sheet with hydrogen bonds occurring between the two elements. Residues Gly152 and Asn154 are located in the loop and turn elements, and appear to facilitate their positioning. The Gly152 residue sits at the terminus of the TM \u03b1-helix III, while the Asn154 side-chain amide forms a hydrogen bond with the carbonyl of the TM \u03b1-helix IV terminus residue Thr157, conserved in 56 of 58 orthologs (Figure S1). The \u03b23/\u03b24-turn and \u03b24-strand of the L5D present the other significant interface to the ZMP Core \u03b23-strand. Among MSA-identified residues, Gly268 preempts the \u03b23/\u03b24-turn, and the Val277 side chain forms the base of a hydrophobic pocket localized approximately at the center of the \u03b24-strand and surrounded by aromatic and hydrophobic residues from the neighboring \u03b23and \u03b22-strands of the L5D \u03b2-sheet. Furthermore, the presence of an analogous glycine and valine-centered hydrophobic interface is also present on equivalent elements of thermolysin (M4), neprilysin (M13), and the G sulfurreducens ZMP (M48) structures, suggesting a common structural motif among these closely related gluzincins.4.5 | ZMP Accessory module residues from TM \u03b1-helix I and the CTD \u03b16-helix complete a unique Ste24 family structural motif A significant portion of the Ste24 enzyme family ZMP Core module is formed by the CTD, including the antiparallel \u03b15and \u03b17-helices and the \u03b16/\u03b17-loop(Figures 3 and 4). The \u03b16-helix of the CTD, associated with the ZMP Accessory module, is positioned at the membrane interface, approximately perpendicular to the \u03b15and \u03b17-helices of the ZMP Core module. Residues of the ZMP Core and Accessory modules form structural interactions with the N-and C-termini of this \u03b1-helix, respectively. The C-terminal end of the \u03b16-helix forms a salt-bridge with Arg387, in a portion of TM \u03b1-helix VII within the ZMP Core module.The N-terminus, via Asp424, forms a second salt-bridge with Arg36 of the neighboring TM \u03b1-helix I of the ZMP Accessory module. The Gln37 residue of the TM \u03b1-helix I is optimally positioned to form hydrogen bond interactions with the peptide backbones of residues forming the \u03b15/\u03b16-loop. The structures of SmSte24 and HsSte24 contain large gaps (\"fenestrations\") between TM \u03b1-helices, and these fenestrations were posited to function as entry (TM \u03b1-helices V/VI) 33,37 and exit (TM \u03b1-helices I/VII)33 portals to the active site, as it is encircled by TM \u03b1-helices and located within the membrane interior (Figure 1A).4.6 | The Ste24 \u03b1-barrel moduleA TM heptahelical \"\u03b1-barrel\" module, absent in soluble gluzincins and unique to the Ste24 enzyme family, contacts the ZMP Core and ZMP Accessory modules (Figures 3C and 4). The \u03b1-barrel module of Ste24, composed of amphipathic \u03b1-helices, forms a voluminous cavity (~14 000 \u00c5 3 in SmSte24 33 ) within the membrane interior. The vast majority of TM \u03b1-helices in integral membrane proteins are hydrophobic; therefore, use of the SmSte24 \u03b1-barrel module in a Dali search yielded both soluble and membrane proteins with structural similarity. The highest-scoring result (Z score of 17.3, with the next highest of Z score less than six) was HsSte24, reinforcing the complete structural novelty of the \u03b1-barrel module. Of the top 100 \"hits,\" approximately two thirds were to soluble protein complexes, reflecting the amphipathic nature of the helices in the \u03b1-barrel search model. Absolutely conserved Ste24 residues Trp97, Pro138, Tyr142, Asp164, Pro219, Phe340, and Pro373 reside in the \u03b1-barrel module(Figure 4). Of these seven residues, Pro138, Asp164, and Pro373 are located within the membrane. Trp97 and",

The ZMP Core and Accessory modules are capped by a membrane-spanning \u03b1-barrel module, so named because of our current lack of understanding of its functional role. In light of the ever-growing literature of Ste24 family orthologs and emergent clinically relevant roles of HsSte24, 28,29,31 the Tripartite Architecture will aid in the interpretation of disparate functional data. Furthermore, our proposed Tripartite Architecture can act as a platform to design experiments to better understand both the functional overlap and individual uniqueness of Ste24 family enzymes among different family orthologs (eg, fungal/mammalian/plant/protist).
