The use of convalescent plasma has a high level of safety, as documented in any previous situation of its use during the last years 6 . Therefore, collection of convalescent plasma for the treatment of COVID-19 patients has started in different countries (among which are the USA 7 , Italy 8 and the Netherlands 9 ) and others will follow in the very next days. Due to this, many clinical trials are ongoing, as regularly updated by the WHO 10 and also by the NIH 11 . These protocols are expected to clarify the effective role (if any) of immune plasma in improving the prognosis of patients affected by severe forms of the disease and we cannot exclude a rapid and sustained increase in the request for this product, if clinical trials would demonstrate its therapeutic efficacy; the increase could be even J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f more pronounced in case of a limited access to other therapeutic options due to the possible shortage of some drugs (as recently highlighted by some regional health authorities 12 ). Therefore, it is now of utmost importance that Blood Establishments are prepared to satisfy requests for \"hyperimmune plasma\" or \"convalescent plasma\", by defining the requirements for the recruitment and the selection of plasma donors and the standards for preparation, qualification, storage and distribution of the product, in compliance with Good Manufacturing Practices and with European and national legislation, without neglecting its safe and appropriate use.",

All the remaining selection criteria must be applied, first of all the exclusion of donors with a previous history of pregnancy and/or blood transfusion.

However, from now on, we can expect a large number of people who have recovered from an asymptomatic infection (or from a disease with minor clinical signs); many among them are probably regular blood donors, as suggested by the number of post-donation information we are receiving in these days on fever and cough appearance, but also considering the high number of asymptomatic carriers of the virus. As soon as a serology J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f testing is available, the demonstration in their sera of an antibody titer >160 by EIA method (or equivalent with other methods) will represent a unique pool of immune plasma providing donors because they are regular blood donors, they are fully compliant with the selection criteria for plasma donation, and an adequate interval (28 days) can separate the resolution of symptoms from the donation. Therefore, this second group of persons can become a relevant source of immune plasma, not requiring any derogation from legal provisions on donor selection. Their recruitment can easily follow a screening for SARS-CoV-2 (eventually followed by a titration of the antibody) in the population of donors at the time of the donation. This could also contribute to havinga deeper insight into the epidemiology of the disease outside the context of a severe clinical disease leading to hospitalisation of patients.",
