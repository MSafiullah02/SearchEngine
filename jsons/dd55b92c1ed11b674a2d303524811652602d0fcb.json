The 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, which preppers consider a 'mid-level' event, and which many of them were well-prepared for, makes clear that scholarly attention to prepper's motivations and methods is both timely and valuable. Drawing from a three-year ethnographic research project with preppers, this paper traces the activity of a single bunker builder who has constructed a technically sophisticated private underground community. Supplemented by additional fieldwork, the paper argues that the boltholes preppers are building in closed communities built to survive the collapse of society, order, and even the environment itself, refract the seemingly irresolvable problems we are failing to address as a species. In the prepper ideology, faith in adaptation has supplanted hope of mitigation, making contemporary bunkers more speculative than reactionary and more temporal than spatial. The bunkers preppers build are an ark to cross through a likely (but often unspecified) catastrophe; they are a chrysalis from which to be reborn -potentially even into an improved milieu.",

However, is was not a bunker built to house or hide citizens of the state or to protect the politicians who ordered its construction. It was an Atlas F missile silo, built in the early 1960s at a cost of approximately $15 million to United States taxpayers. It was one of 72 'hardened' missile silo structures built from concrete mixed with an epoxy-based resin, protecting a nucleartipped Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICMB) one hundred times more powerful than the bomb dropped on Nagasaki. The function of this bunker was therefore 'both defensive and offensive\u2026 based on a twofold logic of protected interiors and outward aggressiveness' (Monteyne, 2011: xix) . Although this bunker was out of sight and out of mind to the average US citizen, it played a crucial role in a geopolitical agenda of extinction-level significance. Bunkers like these were, and are, as Ian Klinke has suggested, biopolitical spaces of extermination (Klinke, 2018: Ch 5) .",

The Survival Condo, and hundreds of analogous experiments in communal bunkered living across the world, are thus built to function as a temporal bridge affording re-emergence into a new, and potentially improved, milieu, political situation, or environment after a disaster. The 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, which many preppers were well prepared for, offers a unique opportunity to assess the motivations and methods of preppers. Ethnographic research about prepping dispels some of the unflattering media representations around the global prepper community and suggest many of thier practices may become normalised in the wake of the disaster. Thus, events like the 2020 pandemic offer fresh opportunities for new scholarship on the practice. ",

As a result, this research focuses on the materiality and temporality of space as much as on practices, since it involved working with preppers who are not just stockpiling goods but actively constructing new architectures for disaster.

For Lapham, the dawn of the nuclear age corresponded to a powerful affective increase in inveterate dread, for not only did atomic weapons seem to embody transcendent power, they were a planetary force, a force that we simultaneously wielded and experienced as beyond our control and understanding. Nuclear dread was predicated on the possibility of extinction and as Thacker (2012: 144) writes, 'human extinction can never be fully comprehended, since it's very possibility presupposes the absolute negation of all thought.' In other words, the possibility triggering our own annihilation contradicted human instincts, causing mass panic and apathy in equal measure (see Bourke, 2006: 191) .",

Two years later, construction began underneath the hotel on large subterranean government bunker. Project Greek Island -as the 112,000-square-foot facility was code-named -was designed to house as many as 1100 people including 535 members of congress and their aides (Vanderbilt 2002: 135) . It featured 18 dormitories, industrial kitchen facilities, a hospital, document vault, power systems, and a television broadcast studio. When President Kennedy took power soon after and became aware of just how proximal the nuclear threat was, he asked Congress to fund the construction of blast-resistant shelters for the general public. This initiative was squarely rejected in favour of a more modest programme focussed on locating and identifying areas that could be used as radiation fallout shelters.",

Survivalism also became a billion-dollar industry (Lamy, 1996: 69) . For early survivalists, paving a path for escape was central.

Much prepping, unlike survivalism, is not based on conspiracy but experience, and there is a 'distinct difference between such fringe elements of the past and the average prepper of today' (Huddleston, 2016: 241) . As Mills writes, contemporary preppers include a wider demographic spectrum of society, and many preppers are not prepping for an apocalyptic event, they are simply interested in securing 'nutrition, hydration, shelter, security, hygiene and medicine' during medium-to long-term periods of infrastructural breakdown (Mills, 2019: 1) . The collapse of supply lines, international travel and trade routes, economic systems, and social order during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic was a prime example of the kind of breakdown preppers were anticipating and had prepared for. The majority of contemporary prepping is not predicated on fringe ideologies, it is built around 'precautionary fears of disaster\u2026 aligned with areas of relatively popular political sentiments' (Mills, 2019: 2) .",

            "text": "Right-wing media shock-jocks in the United States, including 'Alex Jones, Glenn Beck and Sean Hannity all advocate doomsday prepping to their audience' (Kelly, 2016: 98) . On the other side of the political spectrum, a Southern California National Public Radio station started airing a show called 'The Big One', which mixed dramatic performances and ominous music to instil listeners with fear about the next big quake before turning to a word from the podcast's sponsor -a company that sells three-day emergency bug out bags for $495. Preppers activities are therefore partly inspired by interpretations of disaster risks shaped by the content of mainstream news media. This has worked to 'normalise' prepping, since the media itself is propagating constant 'fear laden assessments of economic policy, health care reform, and security risks to a wide a receptive audience' (Mills, 2019: 24; Mills, 2018: 8) . A global disaster having finally arrived, it is likely that prepping will become even more widepread and socially acceptable. Kelly (2016: 98) estimates contemporary prepping to be a $500million-a-year industry, following estimates from a 2013 New York Times article (Feuer, 2013) . More recent estimates suggest that 3.7 million Americans actively identify as preppers (Stec, 2016) . It is a practice that has expanded well beyond the United States. Campbell et al. (2019: 799) write that prepping is 'an increasingly mainstream phenomenon, driven not by delusional certainty, but a precautionary response to a generalised anxiety people have around permanent crisis.' Klein (2017: 351) suggests that even 'in Silicon Valley and on Wall Street\u2026 high-end survivalists are hedging against climate disruption and social collapse by buying space in custom-built underground bun-kers\u2026' Indeed, prepping is an even bigger business than its survivalist forbearer. We are in the midst of a second billion-dollar -a-year 'doom boom', with sales of preserved food alone surging over 700% since 2008 (Mills 2018: 2) . In the United States, preserved 'survival food' is even being been stocked by major retailers such as Costco, Kmart and Bed, Bath & Beyond (Mills 2019: 2) .",

Despite the fact that a full 1.13% of the United States population, and millions more beyond those borders, are prepping, academic research around the topic is scant. What does exist is often superficial and na\u00efve, being based wholly on analysis of popular representations. Foster's (2014) book Hoarders, Doomsday Preppers, and the Culture of Apocalypse, for instance, was based on watching the Doomsday Preppers 'reality' TV show on the National Geographic Channel. What Foster ultimately offers is a shallow and ambiguous caricature of the community that bears little reality of the everyday lives of preppers and conflates their activities with hoarding, which makes little sense, given how much time preppers spend carefully organizing and streamlining lifesaving stockpiles. In another paper devoted to what was termed the 'man-poclypse', Kelly writes that that prepper culture is infused with '\u2026 feelings of male alienation [that] translate into preparations for an uncertain future' (Kelly, 2016: 96) , another assumption based on watching television which is quickly undermined by fieldwork, where it becomes clear women are often the driving force behind preparations. Finally, Kabel and Chmiding (2014) conducted what they called a 'netnography' -a portmanteau for 'Internet ethnography' -on prepper web forums. Though their study relied on first-person accounts rather than third-person representations, ethnographic research undertaken into internet posturing, particularly when posted anonymously, is no substitute for on-the-ground fieldwork.",

The research undertaken by Mills was larger in scope, spanning eighteen US states and including thirty-nine people. Mills found that partisan politics play a key role in the ideologies undergirding prepping practices and provided grounded evidence regarding prepper's anxieties about the unknown (Mills, 2018 (Mills, , 2019 . Most recently, Barker's extensive research, which involved in-depth interviews, participant observation of prepper meetups, and online analysis, provocatively suggests that in becoming resilient citizens, preppers are 'recuperating the agency of future temporalities, by finding empowerment, pleasure and vitality in moving closer to their metabolic vulnerability' (Barker, 2019: 11) .

The inability to know which disaster is being prepared for, or at what scale, coupled with the perceived inevitability of catastrophe, has created the palpable affect of dread that preppers are acting on. Dread differs from anxiety in that it is about the future rather than the present and differs from fear because it stems from a danger not immediately present or even discernible. It is an anthropogenic practice refracting 'the limits of explanation' (Mi\u00e9ville, 2014: 58) .",

In the context of climate change, species-jumping viruses, biological engineering, or the disposal of nuclear waste, for instance, the environment itself has become a technical problem constantly in need of upgrade and repair, so that we will forevermore live in a state of permanent catastrophe to be managed rather than avoided (De Cauter, 2004: 100) .

In the same edited collection, Juha Van 't Zelfde evocatively suggests that through the 'dialectical coupling of caution and transgression, of paralysis and overdrive, dread allows us to imagine the world differently' (Zelfde, 2014: back cover), offering us an alternative framing for seeing dread as a productive force. In this framing, dread is linked with millenarian apocalyptic ideologies of death and rebirth, where the frustration of choice results in a decision to fold to cosmic pressure and start again. The architecture of dread is thus also dialectical, in the sense that it promises both disaster and salvation. The bunker is built because 'it is only at the instant when salvation is actually posited that this dread is overcome' (Kierkegaard, 1968: 48) .

He waved me over to the nuclear, biological, and chemical (NBC) air filtration unit for the condo and explained that they had three militarygrade filters each providing 2000-cubic feet per minute of filtration. He told me they 'were $30,000 a pop. I put $20 million into this place and when you start buying military-grade equipment from the government you wouldn't believe how quickly you get to that number. ' Hall's team had drilled forty-five 300-foot deep subterranean geothermal wells and installed a reverse osmosis water system that uses hydrogen peroxide and colloidal silver to purify water before pumping it through UV sterilization and carbon paper filters. The system can filter 10,000 gallons of water a day into three electronically-monitored 25,000-gallon tanks. Power to the bunker is supplied by five different redundant systems. This is crucial, since as a life-support system, losing power would kill everyone in the facility. Hall elaborated, ' We've got a bank of 386 submarine batteries with a life of 15 or 16 years. We're currently running at 50-60 kW, 16-18 of which are coming from the wind turbine\u2026 However, we can't do solar here\u2026 because the panels are fragile, and this is, after all, tornado alley.

Given the severe limitations of underground living, anything extraneous must be eliminated. The entire building must be thought of as a single unit, where the actions of each resident inevitably effects all other residents. This of course is what makes the bunker more like a submarine journey than a tower block: the elimination of external infrastructural support. In the event of a major incident, the umbilical cord to the world on the other side of the blast doors would be snipped and the clock would start ticking to a resupply.",

One prepper interviewed suggested that the bunker he was building was the best escape plan possible within the confines of the geo. He told me, 'we can't build a celestial ark like Elon Musk, we can't leave the earth, so we're going to go into the earth. I'm building a spaceship in the earth. ' If the factory was the defining private architectural form of the early 20th century, and the fallout shelter the most iconic of the Cold War years, the skyscraper was the defining architecture of late neoliberalism. In the 21st century however, the private bunker has emerged as an unmistakable architectural form for our new dark age, 'securing the futures of humanity under turbulent conditions in enclosed systems that have given up on fixing the world and insists on building a new one inside their confines within a permanent state of emergency' Rutherford, 2018: 1145; Shapiro and David-Bird, 2017) . As sustainable technologies and the collapse of the age of globalisation intertwine with unprecedented private abilities to excavate, a new subterranean politics of temporal resurrection is developing that is central to the ideology driving prepping acivities.

A world without us in it does not include us considering the consequences of survival. The possibility of salvation, the freedom in making the choice to survive, and the potential satisfaction reaped from taking that leap of faith, is what prompted Keirkegaard to write in his journals that 'dread is a desire for what one dreads, a sympathetic antipathy' (Dru, 1938) . This double-edge desire is the kernel of the resurrection temporality that drives contemporary millenarian ideologies. One prepper building a large-scale bunker told me that 'I imagine walking through the doors of [the bunker] when it's finally finished and feeling the anxiety drop out of my body. I imagine spending time in there with my family, safe and secure, becoming my best version of myself.' Another, when questioned about what they might do in their bunker, responded, 'Well, you could do anything, you could learn how to meditate, you could learn how to levitate, you could walk learn how to walk through walls. When you get rid of all the distractions and crap around us keeping us from doing these things, who knows what you can accomplish?' Such suggestions undermine the assertion that 'the desire to remain corporeally unchanged or unaffected emerges as a foundation for survivalism' (Rahm, 2013: 3) . Preppers desire what they dread precely due to the hope that change offers.",

The period assigned, be it a week, month, a year or five, is both speculative and crucial.

The privatisation of subterranean hardened architecture constitutes a reconfiguration of volumetric territory based on prediction and speculation, a worldview committed to adaptation rather than mitigation, a move from geopolitics towards chronopolitics (Virilio, 1999) . Our present crisis is not one of space but time. The bunker is defined not by its form but by its function, which is resurrection. Making the trip though the subterranean ark possible is a community of people with complementary skills required for the crossing. What is meant to emerge from the private chrysalis is a community who hold a body of knowledge and the materials to rebuild (Dartnell, 2015) . In this way, the personal/family backyard shelters of the first doom boom contrast modern bunkers, just as survivalists of the past are a markedly different community than the preppers of today.

You want good quality food and water and for everyone to feel safe and to feel they're working together towards a common purpose. This thing's got to function like a miniature cruise ship. 'Doomsday' bunkers pose fascinating and important questions about materiality, as sites of geological-geopolitics and harbour a unique spatiality, in that they are a volumetric extension of atomised life in late capitalism -a kind of uber-gated community -but the primary attribute of these bunkers is in the way they temporalize space. Beck (2011: 82) rightly notes that 'the bunker promises security and control in the form of refuge\u2026 both womb-and tomb-like.'

Equally, by expanding optics on the materiality of the bunker to give serious consideration to the social forces behind contemporary underground construction, and the completely rational retreat into them during the COVID-19 pandemic, it becomes clear that the preppers are not social anomalies, but gatekeepers to understanding the contemporary human condition (Garrett, 2020) .
