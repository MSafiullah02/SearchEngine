On this basis, case fatality from COVID-19 infection in Australia is presently between 0.4% to 3.0%. Australia all reporting less new cases in the three to five days prior (Supplement Figures A   and B) . Hence the rate of rise in incidence has slowed, mindful of the limitations of applying trends to short periods of time. Based on extrapolation of trends prior to 29 March 2020, the Australian healthcare system would have been over-run by over 12,000 confirmed cases by 12 April 2020 (Supplement Figure C) . Furthermore, ICU capacity would have been exceeded by mid to end April 2020 (Supplement Figure D) . The associated ICU costs would have amounted to between AUD $8.82 million and $34.38 million if capped at the current maximum number of ICU beds. Notably, Australia has successfully averted these outcomes through timely implementation and strict enforcement of bans on travel and social gatherings, as well as concerted diagnostic and management strategies.",
