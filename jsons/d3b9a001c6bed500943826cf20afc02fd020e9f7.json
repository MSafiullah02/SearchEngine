Historically, the KAP model was developed for family 118 planning and population studies in the 1950s, with its purpose being to measure the extent to 119 which any clear opposition to the notion and organization of family planning existed among 120 different populations, so specific family planning practices could be used for different program 121 purposes worldwide [31] . KAP surveys are now the most widely used studies for uncovering 122 societal context in public health research [32] [33] [34] . These surveys are easy to design, data output 123 is quantifiable, interpretation is robust and their utility is generalizable for context specific 124 problems [35] . Information generated through KAP studies assist to develop strategies with a 125 focus to improve the behavioral and attitudinal changes driven by the level of knowledge and 126 perceptions towards preventive practices [36] . In a recent KAP study conducted in China, Zhong 127 et al. [37] reported that to facilitate outbreak management of COVID-19, there is an urgent need 128 to understand the public's awareness of COVID-19. They asserted that success against COVID-129 19 requires peoples' adherence to control measures which is largely affected by their knowledge, 130 attitudes and practices. 131 .

On the other hand, the attitude scores 244 varied significantly (p<0.01) between gender and among occupation groups. The attitude score 245 for female (7.38\u00b11.03) is higher than that for male (7.12\u00b11.15) though both have comparable 246 knowledge scores. This observation is a positive one as females are more responsible in 247 maintaining family hygiene and teach the children. The good knowledge, attitude and practice of 248 female over male is supported by their lower mortality rate in this diseases, although female are 249 globally more prone to this disease than male [32, 42] . While the highest attitude score of the 250 'Retired' (7.55\u00b10.69) was a reflection of their highest knowledge score; for other professional 251 groups, knowledge scores mismatched their attitude scores. Surprisingly, the attitude scores of 252 'Government staff' (7.08\u00b11.22) was the lowest with that of the 'Student' (7.08\u00b11.16). 253",
