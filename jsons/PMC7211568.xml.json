This emerging coronavirus is closely related genetically to the SARS-CoV-1 and uses the human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) and transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) as host cell receptors. The binding between SARS-CoV-2 and these cell receptors leads to hyper-activation of the NF-\u03baB pathway and increased production of inflammatory cytokines including IL-6 and TNF\u03b1, which are implicated in the severe lung injury and poor clinical outcomes in patients with COVID-19 [1].",

Findings from a recent systematic review suggest lack of evidence for vertical transmission of SARS-CoV-2 [2], however studies evaluating the effects of inflammation dysregulation in pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2, the effects on the pathophysiology and genomic function of the placenta and the potential short- and long-term effects on children developmental outcomes are yet to be fully explored. On April 11, 2020, a study showed that pregnant women with SARS-CoV-2 infection had higher levels of IL-6 compared to non-pregnant women which may important implications in the development of fetuses [3].",

Maternal immune activation appears to act as a \u201cneurodevelopmental disease primer\u201d increasing the susceptibility of individuals to the epigenetic alterations and environmental exposures that can interact in triggering disease-related symptoms later in life [4]. IL-6 has been treated as an indicator of maternal systemic inflammation with potential to influence placental-fetal interactions and subsequently fetal brain development and increased risk of offspring psychiatric disorders. Although the role of IL-6 in the pathogenesis of neurodevelopmental disorders is not fully understood, a longitudinal study showed alterations in brain architecture, executive function, and working memory abilities in neonates at 2 years of age exposed to increased levels of IL-6 during pregnancy [5]. In addition, it has been found that maternal IL-6 is inversely associated with offspring cognition at 12-months age, which strengthen the assumption that maternal inflammation may constitute an intrauterine condition of particular importance in the context of potentially neuropsychiatric disorders [6].",
