Early recognition of explosive outbreaks with severe illness would seem to benefit most from aggressive institutional prophylaxis. However, it is unclear at what threshold sporadic influenza activity should elicit institutional chemoprophylaxis.

Even afebrile residents with minor respiratory symptoms were cultured. A nasopharyngeal and throat swab (two separate swabs) was obtained from all consenting residents by research nurses. Swabs were placed in transport media (veal broth with gentamicin, penicillin, streptomycin, and amphotericin), cooled to 4\u00b0C within 1 hour, transported cold (4 to 8OC) to the Wisconsin State Laboratory of Hygiene Virology Laboratory, and inoculated into cell cultures (24-well plates of Madin Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells; tubes of Primary rhesus Monkey Kidney, Hep-2 and WI-38 cells) for isolation of cultivable respiratory viruses within 30 hours of collection. MDCK cultures were incubated stationary at 35\u00b0C for 5 days. All tube cultures were incubated on a roller apparatus at 33\u00b0C for up to 14 days. Virus identification was performed using routine methods. During the 1995-1996 season, all viral cultures were collected by clinical staff who performed throat cultures only. Therefore, clinical surveillance and cultures were performed by research staff under an identical protocol during six seasons and by clinical staff during one season.

In 1997-1998, the last cases at the Home occurred 1 week after the last cases in the rest of the state of Wisconsin. The duration of antiviral prophylaxis should be guided by ongoing surveillance within the facility. The importance of culturing at the end of the influenza season was suggested in 1991-1992 when we identified significant RSV activity at the end of the outbreak. We could have continued prophylaxis unnecessarily, based on the continued occurrence of clinical respiratory illnesses, had we not had surveil-lance culturing in place. In addition, the isolation of influenza A from a resident whose respiratory illness began in the second week of chemoprophylaxis (as occurred during the 1993-1994 season) suggests a resistant strain and might prompt a switch to an alternate antiviral when they become available.\" Timely and accurate information regarding influenza activity within the facility could allow a more focused duration of prophylaxis.",

The cost of 7 days of rimantadine for 200 residents is approximately $2450.00. Our current cost for an influenza culture is approximately $50.00. One week of rimantadine in a 200-bed facility, therefore, has a cost similar to 40 viral cultures. Our system of intensive surveillance with cultures is unlikely to become the standard of care. Greater economy might include cultures restricted to febrile respiratory illness after influenza A has been cultured by a regional laboratory. If clinical criteria for an outbreak were approached, all residents with respiratory illness of recent onset could be cultured and antiviral prophylaxis initiated pending culture results. Culturing of any new respiratory illnesses could begin again beforc the anticipated discontinuation of prophylaxis (14 days) to determine if influenza activity was contin~ing.'~ Clinical recognition of an outbreak of respiratory illness is not difficult. Declaring an outbreak of Influenza A, however, may be difficult because other winter respiratory viruses are capable of producing severe illness (i.e., influenza B, RSV, and parainfluenza 1). Each clinician must assess the relevance of hidher viral culture monitoring system for timeliness and proximity, as well as the proportion of respiratory illnesses culture-confirmed as influenza A, when initiating antiviral chemoprophylaxis. We do not wish to discourage clinicians from initiating timely, lifesaving chemoprophylaxis. We con-sider the response to a winter outbreak of respiratory illness to be analogous to the timely response to a severe febrile illness. The clinician should obtain appropriate cultures and simultaneously initiate antimicrobial coverage pending the results of cultures. We recommend that clinicians perform surveillance for new respiratory symptoms, followed by laboratory confirmation, to determine an outbreak's beginning and end, thus enabling them to limit prophylaxis to the shortest effective duration.",
