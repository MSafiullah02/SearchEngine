Okapi BM25 was not added to Lucene until 2011, 1 more than a decade after it gained widespread adoption in the research community; the consensus had long emerged that it was more effective than TF-IDF variants.

The switch from TF-IDF to BM25 as Lucene's default scoring function in 2015 created a natural upper bound on scores due to BM25's saturation effect, which made it possible to implement retrieval algorithms that reasoned about maximum scores without changes to Lucene's index format. This led to an effort to implement a general-purpose Wand [3] , based on a previous implementation for BooleanQuery. Lucene received support for Wand at the end of 2017 (although it wasn't released until version 8.0 with block-max indexes).",

Common analytics use cases depend on this count, and many search engines display this value in their interfaces (see additional discussion in Sect. 5). Second, the fact that some Lucene queries could produce negative scores became problematic, so Lucene now requires positive scores. 3 Support for block-max indexes was the final feature that was implemented, based on the developers' reading of the paper by Ding and Suel [6] , which required invasive changes to Lucene's index format. Note that the paper describes directly storing the maximum impact score per block, which fixes the scoring function at indexing time. To provide flexibility in being able to swap in different scoring functions, the Lucene implementation stores all tf (term frequency) and dl (document length) pairs that might yield the maximum score. If we have one such pair (tf i , dl i ) then we can remove all other pairs (tf j , dl j ) where tf j \u2264 tf i \u2227 dl j \u2265 dl l , since they are guaranteed to yield lower (or equal) scores-based on the assumption that scores increase monotonically with increasing tf and decreasing dl. This is implemented by accumulating all such pairs in a tree-like structure during the indexing process. These pairs are stored in skip lists, so the information is available to groups of 8, 64, 512, 4096, . . . blocks, allowing query evaluation to skip over more than one block at a time.",

Results are shown in Table 1 , where figures in the top three rows are copied from Table 1 in the original paper. It is interesting that Ding and Suel report a much larger increase in performance comparing exhaustive Or to Bmw (18\u00d7 on TREC 2005 and 8\u00d7 on TREC 2006) than the comparable conditions in Lucene (a more modest improvement of around 3\u00d7). This is due to a more optimized implementation of exhaustive Or in Lucene, which, for example, implements block processing [5] . Interestingly, Ding and Suel report faster query evaluation in absolute terms, even on hardware that is much older: among the differences include C++ vs. Java, as well as the simplicity of a research prototype vs. the realities of a fully-featured search library. Beyond implementation differences, Lucene must additionally compute the upper bound scores per block from the stored (tf, dl) pairs on the fly. We also report performance evaluations on two other standard test collections frequently used in academic information retrieval: ClueWeb09b and ClueWeb12-B13, with the same sets of queries. These results are shown in Table 2 , where we report figures for different values of retrieval depth k, also averaged over three trials. These numbers are consistent with Fig. 7 in Ding and Suel's paper: performance of exhaustive Or drops modestly as depth k increases, but Bmw performance degrades much more quickly. This is exactly as expected.",

This is somewhat stating the obvious, but this fateful decision highlights the idiosyncratic nature of technology adoption. We could imagine alternatives where the Lucene developers had not come across the paper and developed a comparable solution in isolation, or they might have known about the paper and elected to take a different approach. In either case, the Lucene solution would likely differ from block-max Wand. This would be akin to convergent evolution in evolutionary biology, whereby different organisms independently evolve similar traits because they occupy similar environments. In such an \"alternate reality\", this paper would be comparing and contrasting different solutions to handling score outliers, not describing a reproducibility effort. To bring researchers and practitioners closer together, we recommend that the former be more proactive to \"evangelize\" their innovations, and the latter be more diligent in consulting the literature.",

This decomposes into two related issues, the technical and the social. From a technical perspective, supporting Bmw required invasive changes to Lucene's index format and a host of related changes in scoring functionsfor example, scores could no longer be negative, and implementations could no longer access arbitrary fields (which was an API change). These had to be staged incrementally. Concomitant with technical changes and backwards-compatibility constraints were a host of \"social\" changes, which required changing users' expectations about the behavior of the software. In short, Bmw was not simply a drop-in replacement. For example, as discussed in Sect. 3, the hit count was no longer accurate, which required workarounds for applications that depended on the value. Because such major changes can be somewhat painful, they need to be justified by the potential benefits. This means that only dramatic improvements really have any hope of adoption: multiple-fold, not marginal, performance gains. An interesting side effect is that entire generations of techniques might be skipped, in the case of Lucene, directly from exhaustive Or to Bmw, leapfrogging intermediate innovations such as MaxScore and Wand.",
