Asymptomatic patients are at risk of viral shedding during examination and procedural work involving these areas should also recognise the risk of transmission across adjacent surfaces [6] . Our current recommendation is all paediatric patients undergoing urgent otolaryngology procedures should be treated as suspected COVID-19 cases until proven otherwise due to the higher proportion of asymptomatic children carrying COVID-19. This is in keeping with guidance emerging from surgical societies and professional organisations [7] . While universal screening of patients prior to surgery would be ideal, few institutions around the world are currently equipped to do so due to restricted availability of testing resources. False negative test results remain an area of concern. As such, specific recommendations about which patients to test is currently evolving day by day and is beyond https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ijporl.2020.110030 the scope of our discussion.",

Reassurance of anxious team members that in fact these procedures are well executed by your team on a regular basis is helpful. A brief but detailed discussion of how the procedure is expected to 'play-out' is important and allows nursing staff to prepare a stockpile of equipment for all eventualities in close proximity to the theatre without contaminating other areas or risking staff by rushed doffing of PPE to leave the room. As mentioned, a PPEprotected clean member of nursing staff allocated to this equipment stockpile streamlined the time taken for the case. All equipment including light-leads, cameras, suction should all be set up and checked prior to arrival of patient in the room.",

Suction attachments and laryngoscope blades set up should reflect these to streamline time and aerosol generation while manipulating the airway. Doffing of PPE is high risk for transmission of aerosolized material and poor technique has been associated with increased COVID infection rates in healthcare workers [10, 11] . Where the temptation is to remove PPE quickly at the end of the case, additional time should be allocated for this. As team members doff, team members need to supervise each other as they doff (especially while staff are new to PPE) to prompt the steps of doffing with proper hand hygiene to be performed between steps. Laminated guides on the wall in these areas are also helpful. This is especially important given the high level of contamination of the theatre and onto staff's PPE during MLB. Aerosol settling time of 20 min is allocated at our institution between the patient leaving at the end of the case prior to any cleaning by nursing staff.",

Tube exchange should be deferred until the patient has ceased being contagious where possible Humidification via tracheostomy tube following new paediatric tracheostomy should continue to be utilized to avoid crusting within the tube differing from adult guidance [16] . Careful clinical judgment is required when selecting the appropriate method of humidification and a heat moisture exchanger (HME) represents an alternative to wet circuit and may decrease aerosol generation. Nebulisers should be avoided and spacers with a metered dose inhaler provide an alternative method of medication delivery to the airway. Caution should be used as unlike adult patients, paediatric tracheostomy tubes classically have no inner cannula for removal and without humidification, are more likely to occlude.
