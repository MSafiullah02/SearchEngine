While clinical, epidemiological, laboratory, and radiological features of COVID-19 [4] have been reported, phenomenological models using statistical methods have been used to examine epidemiological data [5, 6]. The COVID-19 is reported to have spread through human-to-human transmission [3]. However, it might be possible that other unobserved environmental exposures may have facilitated the rate the disease spreads through human-to-human transmission. Earlier studies based on phenomenological models fail to capture unobserved factors and heterogeneity, which are useful in understanding cases with limited epidemiological data. The complexities of the unobserved factors accounting for COVID-19 underpin this study. Using publicly available data for 31 Provinces/States across China, this study is the first to develop both time series and panel data models to examine the nexus between the novel coronavirus attributable deaths and confirmed cases of COVID-19. We use novel estimation methods capable of accounting for Provinces/States-specific fixed-effects and unobserved heterogeneity of the human-to-human transmission.",

The data consist of four health indicators such as deaths, confirmed cases, suspected cases, and recovered cases across 31 Provinces/States in China namely Anhui, Beijing, Chongqing, Fujian, Gansu, Guangdong, Guangxi, Guizhou, Hainan, Hebei, Heilongjiang, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Inner Mongolia, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Liaoning, Jilin, Ningxia, Qinghai, Shaanxi, Shandong, Shanxi, Shanghai, Tianjin, Tibet, Sichuan, Zhejiang, Yunnan and Xinjiang. Our intial observation of data available and presented in Figure 1 shows a widespread of case-patients in Hubei Province compared to other locations (Figure 2). This validates the exact location, the city of Wuhan, where the outbreak was first reported. We observe a daily average of about 1000 confirmed cases, 60 deaths and 161 recovered cases.",

The selection of estimation methods was based on real-time reporting of COVID-19 used as a priori expectation. By confirming a perfectly linear relationship between deaths and confirmed cases, our models were constructed on such tangent. Model 1 was developed using the fixed-effects linear model with first-order autoregressive [AR(1)] disturbances to accommodate for the unevenly spaced data across China, rendering the panel setting unbalanced. Model 2 was estimated based on a fixed-effects model with Driscoll-Kraay standard errors to account for possible heteroskedasticity, autocorrelation and cross-sectional dependence amid missing data and unbalanced panel setting [7]. Model 3 was estimated using a fixed-effects model with modified Wald (MWALD) statistic to examine heteroskedasticity in the residuals. Our model of interest with fixed-effects can be expressed as [8]:(1)lnDeathsi,t=lnDeathsi,t\u22121+\u03b1+\u03b2\u2217lnConfirmedCasesi,t+vi+\u03b5i,tWhere ln denotes logarithmic transformation to give the variable a constant variance, Deaths denotes the novel coronavirus attributable deaths, ConfirmedCases represents confirmed cases, \u03b1 and \u03b2 are the constant and coefficient to be estimated, vi is the Provinces/States-specific fixed-effects and \u03b5i,t is the independent and identically distributed error term across individual Provinces/States i=1,\u2026,N in time t=1,\u2026,Ti.",

The estimated models are statistically significant at 5% level (95% CI) and a corresponding predictive power (R-squared) between 68%-100%. The modified wald statistic (MWALD) of Model 3 rejects the null hypothesis of homoskedasticity. Meaning that the effect of confirmed cases on the novel coronavirus attributable deaths is heterogeneous across Provinces/States in China. In both panel and time series models presented, the lagged-dependent variable (LDV) of coronavirus attributable deaths (lnDeathst-1) is positive and statistically significant at 1% level except Model 5 which shows a significant (99% CI) negative coefficient. LDV was introduced in the models to control for omitted variable bias and account for the inertia effects of the reported coronavirus attributable deaths. The positive coefficient of lnDeathst-1 in almost all the models reveals that the historical factors of coronavirus attributable deaths are persistent and likely to affect future reported deaths. On the contrary, when unobserved common factors affecting coronavirus attributable deaths are controlled in Model 5, the coefficient on LDV turns negative. Meaning that the inertia effect of historical deaths is curtailed, hence, reducing the impact of confirmed cases.",

However, the role of the unobserved heterogeneity and common factors that facilitate the transmission of COVID-19 remains unclear.
