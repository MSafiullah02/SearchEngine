Anti-SARS therapeutics could target any one of several major steps in the viral life-cycle, such as virus\u2013cell interactions, virus entry, intracellular viral replication, virus assembly and exit.4 Extensive studies have been carried out on the proteins involved in these steps.5 The intracellular replication of CoV is mediated by a replicase complex derived from two virally coded polyprotein precursors, pp1a (486 kDa) and pp1ab (790 kDa).6., 7. The formation of this replicase complex requires the extensive processing of the two polyproteins by two cysteine peptidases encoded within them; namely, the main peptidase (Mpro), also known as the 3C-like peptidase (3CLpro) because of its similarity to the 3C peptidases of Picornaviridae,8 and the accessory papain-like peptidase 2 (PL2pro),7 which cleaves at three sites in the N-proximal regions of the two polyproteins. By contrast, Mpro cleaves at 11 sites in the central and C-proximal regions of the two polyproteins, releasing key viral replication proteins, such as an RNA polymerase and a helicase.7 As an essential protein, Mpro is an attractive molecular target for the development of anti-SARS drugs.",

All of these structures show that the two protomers of Mpro are oriented almost perpendicular to each other. The N-terminal residues 1\u20137 of each protomer constitute the N-finger, of which Arg4 was shown to be mandatory for the dimerization and the exhibition of the catalytic activity of Mpro.14 Beyond the N-finger, each protomer consists of three domains. Domain I (residues 8\u2013101) and domain II (residues 102\u2013184) comprise a two-\u03b2-barrel fold similar to that of the chymotrypsin-type serine peptidases. Domain III (residues 201\u2013300) has five \u03b1-helices and is connected to domain II by a long loop (residues 185\u2013200). Each protomer has its own substrate-binding region situated in the cleft between domains I and II. Recent mutagenesis studies have confirmed that, similar to the main peptidases from human coronavirus strain 229E,15., 16. and porcine transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus,17 SARS-CoV Mpro is a cysteine peptidase with a Cys-His catalytic dyad at the active site.16., 18. As suggested by the structure-based sequence alignment of the main peptidases (including their flanking residues in the polyproteins) from SARS-CoV and other coronaviruses,16 and confirmed by in vitro studies,7., [9] Mpro cleaves preferentially at a consensus sequence for the P4 to P1\u2032 residues of substrates (the nomenclature is based on that used by Schechter & Berger19 with the arrow indicating the cleavage site): (amino acid with a small side-chain)-(any amino acid)-Leu-Gln\u2193(Ala, Ser, Gly).",

The side-chain of the P1 residue predominantly determines the target-peptidase specificity of an APE. The substituent on the epoxide C2 atom also allows some tuning of both the inhibitory activity and specificity of APE towards a particular target peptidase. In the APE, the C\u03b1 atom of the P1 residue is replaced by a nitrogen atom, yielding an aza-amino acid residue. This introduces trigonal planar geometry to the \u03b1-atom of the P1 residue and reduces the electrophilicity of the carbonyl C atom of the P1 residue, thereby making the carbonyl group of the P1 residue resistant to nucleophilic attack.34 It has been proposed that APEs inhibit their target peptidases irreversibly by a mechanism in which the catalytic Cys S\u03b3 atom nucleophilically attacks one of the two epoxide carbon atoms (C2 or C3) of APE.30\n,\n32., 33. This results in the opening of the conformationally strained epoxide ring, with the formation of a covalent bond between the Cys S\u03b3 atom and the attacked APE atom. An APE containing Gln at P1 inhibits Mpro with a k\ninact/K\ni\n = 1900(\u00b1400) M\u22121 s\u22121. In this reaction, the catalytic Cys145 S\u03b3 atom attacks the epoxide C3 atom of the APE.29\n",

On the basis of this trend, a pH-triggered switch for the catalytic activity of Mpro was proposed.25 We have now grown crystals of Mpro in the same space group (P21 with the same unit-cell constants) at pH 6.0 under slightly different conditions; the active sites and the S1 specificity pockets of both protomers are in the catalytically competent conformation (Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4\n). More specifically, superposition of protomers A and B of the resulting Mpro structure (rmsd 0.50 \u00c5 for 1070 out of 1172 main-chain atoms) shows good agreement in most atomic positions. In both independent protomers, the catalytic dyad has a distance of 3.6 \u00c5 between the His41 N\u03b52 atom and the Cys145 S\u03b3 atom, and the Cys145 S\u03b3 atom is coplanar with the atoms of the His41 imidazole ring. Residues Gly143 to Cys145 are in the proper conformation to form the oxyanion hole that accommodates the carbonyl O atom of the scissile peptide bond of the substrate; the position to be occupied by the carbonyl O atom is occupied by a water molecule. The O atom of the water molecule forms hydrogen bonds at distances of 3.0 \u00c5 with the Gly143 N atom and with the Cys145 N atom (Figure 3(a) and (b)).",

The position to be occupied by the side-chain carbonyl O atom of P1-Gln of the substrate is occupied by a water molecule, whose O atom forms a hydrogen bond with the His163 N\u03b52 atom (2.9 \u00c5); this water molecule is coplanar with the atoms of the imidazole ring of His163. In both protomers, Phe140 and Glu166 interact with Ser1 of the opposite protomer to form the \u201cfloor\u201d of the S1 specificity pocket (Figure 3(a) and (b)). In protomer A, the Glu166A O\u03b51 atom forms a hydrogen bond (2.8 \u00c5) with the His172A N\u03b52 atom, thereby constituting a \u201cside-wall\u201d of the S1 specificity pocket similar to that in protomer A of previously reported structures and the molecular-dynamic simulation model of Mpro at pH 6.0 (Figure 3(a)).25., 36. However, in protomer B of the structure of Mpro reported here, the side-chain of Glu166B rotates away and the His172B N\u03b52 atom forms a hydrogen bond (3.0 \u00c5) with the Ser1A O\u03b3 atom of protomer A instead. The Ser1A O\u03b3 atom also forms a hydrogen bond (2.8 \u00c5) with the Gly170B carbonyl O atom (Figure 3(b)). The difference in the side-chain conformation of Glu166 in protomers A and B of the structure of Mpro reported here indicates the weakness of the interaction between the side-chains of Glu166 and His172, even though this interaction may acquire some ionic character by the protonation of the His172 N\u03b41 atom. Contrary to those in protomer B of both the previously reported structure and the molecular-dynamic simulation model of Mpro at pH 6.0,25., 36. the side-chains of His163B and Glu166B do not interact in protomer B of the structure of Mpro reported here, probably because His163B is protonated only at its N\u03b52 atom and carries no charge.",

More importantly, the presence of a ten-residue affinity tag at the N terminus of both independent protomers reduces the specific activity of Mpro by less than an order of magnitude.29 Similar observations are given by the crystal structure of Mpro with additional residues Ser-Leu at the N terminus of both independent protomers (PDB accession code 1Q2W; J.

Interestingly, M+A(-1)\npro crystallizes in space group P43212 as well as in space group P212121 under the same conditions. In space group P43212, each asymmetric unit has one protomer of M+A(-1)\npro. Superpositions of the resulting structure of the unbound M+A(-1)\npro with the crystal structures of Mpro in the other conditions show no difference in the overall fold or the protomer orientation. Crystal contacts of the unbound M+A(-1)\npro in space group P43212 do not involve any residues forming the active sites and the S1 specificity pockets of the peptidase. The structure of the unbound M+A(-1)\npro in space group P43212 shows good agreement in most atomic positions with the structure of the APE-bound M+A(-1)\npro in space group P212121. In the structure of the unbound M+A(-1)\npro reported here, the catalytic dyad has a distance of 3.9 \u00c5 between the His41 N\u03b52 atom and the Cys145 S\u03b3 atom, and the Cys145 S\u03b3 atom is coplanar with the atoms of the His41 imidazole ring. However, the oxyanion hole and the S1 specificity pocket are distorted (Figure 2, Figure 3). The \u03d5 and \u03c8 angles of residues Lys137 to Ser144 show dramatic differences compared with those of the previously reported structure of the APE-bound M+A(-1)\npro\n29 (Figure 4(c)). The above-average B-factors of these residues in the unbound M+A(-1)\npro indicate their high mobility relative to the rest of the peptidase (Figure 5(c)). The oxyanion hole is not distorted as much; the N atoms of Gly143 and Cys145 are still oriented to donate hydrogen bonds that would stabilize the negatively charged carbonyl O atom of the scissile peptide bond of the substrate, although no water molecule is found at the position to be occupied by the carbonyl O atom (Figure 3(c)).",

The Phe140 carbonyl O atom also forms a long hydrogen bond with the OH group of Tyr118 (3.4 \u00c5). The electron density maps show two possible conformers of the side-chain of Glu166; the occupancies of both conformers were fixed at 0.5 without refinement.

Outstanding electron density for APE was observed only in the electron density maps of M+A(-1)\npro; it could be fit only by the 2S,3S diastereomer (Figure 6(a)). The latter is consistent with the results of the studies on the inhibition of Mpro by the APE in these versions. These results can be explained with the models of all four of the possible diastereomers of the APE binding to Mpro.29 Superpositions of the structures of the unbound and the APE-bound M+A(-1)\npro reported here show that the binding of the APE does not grossly affect the overall fold or the protomer orientation of the M+A(-1)\npro dimer.

In the refinement of all of the structures of the APE-bound Mpro and M+A(-1)\npro, a restraint was applied to this C-S bond on the basis that the length of a C-S single bond is normally about 1.8 \u00c5. Interestingly, the opened epoxide moiety of the APE always tended to be tilted away from Cys145 of Mpro or M+A(-1)\npro, thereby lengthening this C-S bond by 0.2\u20130.3 \u00c5, even though the opened epoxide moiety of the APE was manually moved back towards Cys145 of Mpro or M+A(-1)\npro regularly during the refinement process. Although such lengthening is not considered significant as the overall positional uncertainties (based on maximum likelihood) of all these structures are in the range of 0.2\u20130.3 \u00c5, it does suggest the possibility of this C-S bond being under strain and vulnerable to rupture caused by a second nucleophilic attack at the epoxide C3 atom of the APE (say, by an activated water molecule), leading to the speculation that the APE could act as a reversible inhibitor of Mpro.",

In the determinations of both structures, the complete wild-type sequence (residues 1\u2013306) of Mpro was over-expressed, purified and crystallized. Although different strategies might have been used in the X-ray diffraction data collection and processing, and in the structure solution and refinement, this could not result in the dramatic structural differences observed. The structural differences probably arise from the differences in the conditions of the preparation and the crystallization of Mpro. Similarly, the crystal structure of Mpro in space group P21212 at pH 6.5 shows that both protomers are in the catalytically competent conformation,37 whereas that in the same space group P21212 and at a slightly higher pH (6.6) shows that both protomers of the latter are in the catalytically incompetent conformation.36 The conformations of the collapsed active sites and S1 specificity pockets observed in the catalytically incompetent protomers show some variability. This variability indicates that the active site and the S1 specificity pocket of each protomer of Mpro do not adopt a single conformation in solution at pH 5.9\u20136.6, but instead there is an ensemble of conformations. A particular conformation might be favored by a particular set of crystallization conditions.",

In both orientations, one or two hydrogen atoms (with partial positive charge) on the phenyl ring of Phe140 are positioned near the central region (with partial negative charge) of the imidazole ring of His163. According to the results of previous studies,39., 40. a single aromatic interaction as such is weak (the interaction energy may be in the range of 1\u20132 kcal/mol only), in contrast to the clusters of aromatic interactions commonly involved in the stabilization of protein structures.41 Therefore, this interaction is susceptible to disruptions that could be caused by changes in a number of factors; the formation of this interaction can be viewed as a reversible process in dynamic equilibrium:(1)Aromatic interaction \u2194 No aromatic interactionThe position of the equilibrium could be determined, in part, by pH. At low pH (near or below the pK\na1 of His163; Figure 9\n), the His163 N\u03b41 atom in a significant number of the Mpro protomers is protonated, thereby introducing a positive charge on the imidazole ring of His163. This would disfavor its aromatic interaction with the phenyl ring of Phe140, and the position of the equilibrium would shift to the right. This is consistent with the trend exhibited by the structures of the unbound Mpro at various pH values (Table 2). In the pH range of 7.0\u20139.0, most of the Mpro protomers have the aromatic interaction and are in the catalytically competent conformation (the left-hand side of the equilibrium predominates); whereas in the pH range of 5.9\u20136.6, some of the Mpro protomers lose the aromatic interaction and are in the catalytically incompetent conformation (the position of the equilibrium shifts to the right).",

In the structure of M+A(-1)\npro reported here, the additional Ala at the N terminus of the opposite protomer blocks Ser1 and disrupts its normal interactions with Phe140 and Glu166 of the parent protomer. This probably weakens the conformational anchor of Phe140, as indicated by its above-average B-factors (Figure 5(c)), making the aromatic interaction of its phenyl ring with the imidazole ring of His163 vulnerable to disruption. In all of the crystal structures of the unbound Mpro (both the wild-type and the variants) determined so far, wherever Phe140 and Glu166 of the parent protomer, and Ser1 of the opposite protomer do not interact normally, the B-factors of residues Lys137 to Ser144 of the parent protomer are above the average, even if the parent protomer is in the catalytically competent conformation (e.g. the Mpro structure of Mpro at pH 6.5 in the space group P21212);37 in contrast, wherever the three residues interact normally, the B-factors of residues Lys137 to Ser144 of the parent protomer are close to the average (e.g. protomer A of the Mpro structure reported here; Figure 5(a)). These observations suggest that the interactions among the three residues can immobilize residues 137 to 144. Apparently, both the ionic interaction between the N terminus of Ser1 and the side-chain of Glu166 of opposite protomers, and the amide hydrogen-carbonyl oxygen hydrogen bonds between Ser1 and Phe140 of opposite protomers contribute to the immobilization of residues Lys137 to Ser144. The Mpro structure at pH 7.0 in space group P2121242 and protomer B of the Mpro structure reported here (Figure 5(b)) suggest that the absence of either interaction slightly compromises the immobilizing effect.",

More particularly, the binding of the APE induces the recovery of the catalytically competent conformation of the oxyanion holes and the S1 specificity pockets of both protomers of M+A(-1)\npro. This induced fit is likely relevant to the binding of APE to Mpro, because of the conformational flexibility of the active sites and the S1 specificity pockets of Mpro discussed above. In all of the crystal structures of the inhibitor-bound Mpro (both the wild-type and the variants) determined so far,25., 26., [27], 29., 42. except for protomer B in the complex of Mpro with a chloromethyl ketone (CMK),25 the active sites and the S1 specificity pockets are in the catalytically competent conformation (Table 2). The induced-fit binding of the APE to M+A(-1)\npro probably is driven by the formation of the covalent bond between the Cys145 S\u03b3 atom of M+A(-1)\npro and the epoxide C3 atom of the APE. It would be energetically costly to break this C-S bond in order to repel the APE and preserve the conformational flexibility of the active sites and the S1 specificity pockets of M+A(-1)\npro. Therefore, the active sites and the S1 specificity pockets of M+A(-1)\npro have to adopt the catalytically competent conformation in order to accommodate a substrate mimic like APE. This explanation probably applies to the actual catalytic cycle of Mpro as well: the acylation step (i.e. formation of the covalent acyl-enzyme intermediate) may drive the induced-fit binding of a substrate to Mpro; after the deacylation step (i.e. breakdown of the covalent acyl-enzyme intermediate), the removal of the product may be favored by the recovery of the conformational flexibility of the active sites and the S1 specificity pockets of Mpro.",

These hydrogen bonds also conformationally anchor Phe140, as indicated by its close-to-average B-factors (Figure 5(d)), and make the \u03c0-stacking of its phenyl ring with the imidazole ring of His163 resistant to disruption. As a result, the catalytically competent conformation of the active sites and the S1 specificity pockets of M+A(-1)\npro is rigidified; the position of the equilibrium described by equation (1) would shift to the left.

The side-chain of P1-Gln of the CMK cannot be accommodated by the collapsed S1 specificity pocket, so it protrudes into the solvent.25 This could be attributed to the covalent bond between the Cys145 S\u03b3 atom of Mpro and the methylene C atom of the CMK, whose rotation can orient the side-chain of P1-Gln of the CMK towards the solvent, thereby avoiding the steric hindrance due to the collapsed S1 specificity pocket. In protomer A of the Mpro:CMK complex, although the active site and the S1 specificity pocket of Mpro are in the catalytically competent conformation (Table 2), allowing the side-chain of P1-Gln of the CMK to occupy the S1 specificity pocket of Mpro, the unoccupied space in the rest of the substrate-binding region of Mpro is large enough for the conformational rearrangements in the rest of the CMK, resulting in an unexpected binding mode of the CMK to protomer A of Mpro as well.25 These unexpected binding modes are not observed in the crystal structures of the complexes of Mpro (both the wild-type and the variants) with the APE,29 nor with the peptidomimetic inhibitors,26., [27] probably because their P' ester groups sterically hinder the rotation of the C-S covalent bond formed between the peptidases and the inhibitors. In the case of the APE, the \u03c0-conjugation of the N\u03b1 atom and the carbonyl group of P1-AGln restricts the orientation of the side-chain of P1-AGln to point towards the S1 specificity pockets of Mpro or M+A(-1)\npro. In the case of the peptidomimetic inhibitors, the C atom attacked by the Cys145 S\u03b3 atom corresponds to the carbonyl C atom of the scissile peptide bond of a substrate. Therefore, the resulting C-S bond pulls the inhibitor towards the back wall of the substrate-binding region. This reinforces the steric hindrance due to the P' ester group of the inhibitor against the rotation of the C-S bond.",

However, these protomers are conformationally flexible; the recovery of their catalytically competent conformation can be induced by the binding of a substrate. The activity of Mpro is still compromised, because of the energetic cost associated with this induced-fit binding. It would be interesting to determine this energetic cost quantitatively, and compare it with the experimentally determined decrease in the activity of Mpro. Before carrying out such studies, the possibility of a second mechanism, such as the change in the protonation/deprotonation state of the catalytic dyad with pH, being involved in the pH-dependence of the activity of Mpro should not be ruled out.",

Extensive studies have been carried out on the role of domain III in the dimerization of Mpro. With domain III truncated, the protomer of Mpro does not dimerize over a wide range of concentrations,10., [14] whereas domain III alone forms a stable dimer even at very low concentrations.10 Truncation of the final C-terminal helix (residues 293\u2013306) strongly disfavors the dimerization of Mpro;[14], 43. analysis of the dimer interfaces observed in the structures of Mpro found that most of the residues of domain III involved in dimer interactions are parts of the final C-terminal helix. Superpositions of the previously reported structures of Mpro in space group P21 at pH 6.0, 7.6 and 8.0,25 show that domain III of both independent protomers rotates in a rigid-body manner as the pH increases from 6.0 to 8.0, whereas the remainder of the Mpro dimer remains essentially in the same atomic positions (Figure 10\n). Domain III of protomer B rotates through a slightly greater angle than does domain III of protomer A. This rotation was regarded as a consequence of the recovery of the catalytically competent conformation of the active sites and the S1 specificity pockets of Mpro as the pH increased from 6.0 to 8.0. However, the structure of Mpro in space group P21 at pH 6.0 reported here, having the active sites and the S1 specificity pockets of both protomers in the catalytically competent conformation, shows good agreement in the atomic positions of domain III of both independent protomers with the previously reported structure of Mpro in space group P21 at pH 6.0, but not with those at pH 7.6 or pH 8.0. The interactions between the domain-III residues of opposite protomers, and the interactions of the residues of domain III with those of domains I and II of the same protomer have been analyzed, but the mechanics of this rotation is still unclear. The structures of Mpro in the other space groups have not been studied over such a wide range of pH. It would be interesting to explore whether this rotation is an artifact associated with crystal packing in space group P21, or whether similar rotations occur in the structures of Mpro in the other space groups as well, indicating some biochemical significance of this rotation. For example, the rotation may represent a mechanism underlying the pH-dependence of the dimerization behaviors of Mpro.12\n",
