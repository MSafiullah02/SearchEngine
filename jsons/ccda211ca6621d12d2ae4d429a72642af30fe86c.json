Medical images analysis is one of the most promising research areas, it provides facilities for diagnosis and making decisions of a number of diseases such as MERS, COVID-19. In this paper, we present a comparison of recent Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) architectures for automatic binary classification of pneumonia images based fined tuned versions of (VGG16, VGG19, DenseNet201, Inception_ResNet_V2, Inception_V3, Resnet50, MobileNet_V2 and Xception). The proposed work has been tested using chest X-Ray & CT dataset which contains 5856 images (4273 pneumonia and 1583 normal). As result we can conclude that finetuned version of Resnet50, MobileNet_V2 and Inception_Resnet_V2 show highly satisfactory performance with rate of increase in training and validation accuracy (more than 96% of accuracy). Unlike CNN, Xception, VGG16, VGG19, Inception_V3 and DenseNet201 display low performance (more than 84% accuracy).",

To describe a disease within populations that arise over a specific period of time, two words are used epidemic and outbreak (Obrane et al., 2017; CDCP, 2012) . Indeed, we can define epidemic as the occurrence of more cases of illnesses, injury or other health condition than expected in a given area or among a specific group of persons during a particular period. Mostly, the cases are pretending to have a common cause (CDCP, 2012) . The outbreak is distinguished from an epidemic as more localized, or the term less likely to evoke public panic.",

More specifically, the infection affects the pulmonary alveoli, the tiny balloonshaped sacs at the end of the bronchioles (see figure 1 ). It usually affects only one of the 5 lobes of the lung (3 lobes in the right lung and 2 in the left), hence the term lobar pneumonia. When pneumonia also reaches the bronchial tubes, it is called \"Bronchopneumonia\". It is the most important cause of death in the world for children younger than 5 years (about 12.8% of annual deaths) (PERCH, 2019; Liu et al., 2016) . It is also a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in adults worldwide and in particular in China Prina et al., 2015; Welte et al., 2012) .Pneumonia is the third leading cause of death in Japan with a higher mortality rate for the elderly, particularly among individuals \u226580 years old (Kondo et al., 2017) . Excluding lung cancer, in Portugal, Pneumonia is the huge cause of respiratory death (Hespanhol and Barbara, 2017) .",

            "text": "Several Coronavirus have passed over the species barrier to cause deadly pneumonia in humans since the beginning of the 21st century. To know the pathogenesis of these deadly epidemics, the specialists have to examine the structure of the viruses and the mechanism of infection. This allows them to help elucidate and provide information for the development of effective treatment and possibly vaccines . Here, we will provide a brief summary of the epidemiology and history of type of Coronavirus in particular: SARS, (Drosten et al., 2003; Ksiazek et al., 2003) is an acute respiratory illness caused by a coronavirus, characterized by fever, coughing, breathing difficulty, and usually pneumonia. SARS It appeared first time in China exactly in the province of Guangdong in 2002 and spread to the world through airtravel routes. Approximately 8098 people were affected, causing in 774 deaths (Walls et al., 2020; Roussel et al., 2020; Wit et al., 2016) with a lethal rate about 10% . It is suggested to originate from bats (Walls et al., 2020; Hu et al., 2017) . SARS symptoms are usually same to flu symptoms: fever, chills, muscle aches, headache and occasionally diarrhoea. After about one-week, other symptoms appear like fever of 38\u00b0C or higher, dry cough, breath shortness . Other cases were identified in Jordan (Hijawi, 2013) , Qatar (Farooq et al., 2020) then spread to the world. MERS is a zoonotic virus that can be transmitted between animals and people. Indeed, the World Health Organization has confirmed that humans are affected because they were on contact with affected dromedary camels (WHO, 2019; Mohd et al., 2016; Azhar et al., 2014) . Studies have shown that how the virus is transmitted from animals to humans is not yet understood, and also the human-to-human transmission is very limited unless there is close contact (WHO, 2018; Ki, 2015; Oboho et al., 2015) . The different MERS symptoms are as follows: Fever, Cough (Dry, Productive), Shortness of breath, Diarrhea, Myalgia, Headache, Nausea, Vomiting, Abdominal pain, Chest pain, Sore throat, Haemoptysis (Farooq et al., 2020; Wang et al., 2019; Baharoon et Memish, 2019; Al-Omari et al., 2019; WHO, 2018; Aguanno et al., 2018) . The world is currently experiencing a dangerous viral epidemic caused by a virus that has killed tens of thousands of people. This new virus called Covid-19 was identified in Wuhan, China in December 2019 Lippi et al. 2020; Amrane et al., 2020; Cortegiani et al., 2020; Tian et al., 2020; Tang et al., 2020; Faralli et al., 2020; Wilder-Smith et al., 2020; Driggin et al. 2020; Cheng et al., 2020; Pung at al., 2020; El Zowalaty and J\u00e4rhult, 2020) . It belongs to the Corona family of viruses, but it is more deadly and dangerous than the rest of the coronaviruses WHO, 2020) . First cases of the disease have been related to a live animal seafood market in Wuhan, denoting to a zoonotic origin of the epidemic (Kandel et al., 2020; Sun et al., 2020; El Zowalaty and J\u00e4rhult, 2020; Wilder-Smith et al., 2020; Roosa et al., 2020; CNHC, 2020) . The routes of transmission, treatments, and results of Covid-19 continually receiving much research attention in the world . Indeed, researchers have identified three main modes of the virus transmission: close person-to-person contact, aerosol transmission and transmission by touch. Lu et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020) . What makes the Corona virus very dangerous is that it can have up to two weeks of incubation without symptoms. We can cite the symptoms of Covid-19: high fever, dry cough, tiredness, shortness of breath, aches and pains, sore throat and very few people will report diarrhoea, nausea or a runny nose (Simcock et al., 2020; WHO, 2020) .",

Medical images analysis is one of the most promising research areas, it provides facilities for diagnosis and making decisions of a number of diseases such as MERS, COVID-19. Recently, many efforts and more attention are paid to imaging modalities and DL in pneumonia. Therefore, interpretation of these images requires expertise and necessitates a several algorithms in order to enhance, accelerate and make an accurate diagnosis. Following this context, DL algorithms (Bhandary et al., 2020) have obtained better performance in the detection of pneumonia, and demonstrated high accuracy compared with previous state of the art methods. Motivated by the fastest and accurate detection rate of pneumonia using deep learning (DL), our work is going to present a comparison of recent Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN) architectures for automatic binary classification of X-Ray images between normal and pneumonia in order to answer to the following research question: Is there any Deep Learning techniques which distinctly outperforms other DCNN techniques?",

Before to discuss these results, let us define the two most parameters used in the state of the art of deep learning and computer vision: Train curve is calculated from the training dataset that provides an idea of how well the model is learning, while the validation curve or test curve is calculated from a hold-out validation dataset that provides an idea of how well the model is generalizing. Moreover, the training and validation loss is defined as a summation of the errors made for each example in validation or training sets. In contrast to accuracy, loss is not a percentage. To summarize, a model that generalizes well is a model that is neither overfit nor underfit, is the best model. Furthermore, the confusion matrix shows the detailed representation of what happens with images after classification (Bhandary et al., 2020) . According to the figure above, it is observed that the accuracy curve of train data is rapidly increasing from epoch 0 to epoch 6 where the accuracy is equal to 83.17% then it starts to be stable until epoch 300 where the accuracy is equal to 86.28% Same for the accuracy curve of test data with an accuracy of 84.84 for epoch 300.",
