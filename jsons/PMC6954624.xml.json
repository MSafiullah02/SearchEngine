After 3 years of piloting voluntary health insurance schemes in some provinces, Vietnam introduced social health insurance to all provinces in 1992 to cover formal-sector workers and pensioners. With the goal of universal coverage, the Vietnamese government issued the first SHI law (Decree No. 63) in 2008, which expanded coverage to people experiencing poverty by fully subsidizing premiums for this group and informal-sector workers. To increase universal health coverage, the SHI law was revised in 2014 and SHI became mandatory for all citizens [3]. According to a report from the Vietnam Social Security (VSS), Vietnam has achieved a remarkable increase in SHI coverage; the number of health insurance card holders reached 83.5 million (88.5% of the total population) in 2019 [4]. As part of the transition from donor-based to SHI-based HIV service delivery, a Prime Minister\u2019s Decision (No. 2188/QD-TTg) was issued in 2016 that introduced a new goal of 100% SHI coverage (hereafter referred to \u201cuniversal SHI coverage\u201d) for PLHIV by 2020. As a result, SHI coverage for PLHIV improved dramatically from 40% in 2014 [5] to more than 85% in 2018 [6].",

As ART has been provided free of charge mainly owing to the support of international donors, many HIV patients are currently served by central urban hospitals and receive better quality of care. However, to be eligible for SHI coverage for HIV services, PLHIV must obtain a SHI card that can be used only in a SHI-registered health facility near their registered residence or in same-level facilities of a SHI-registered hospital/clinic in the same province. Although SHI coverage and decentralization improve access to HIV services at lower levels of care, they may pose new challenges for PLHIV who have been receiving ART free of charge at higher-level hospitals [7]. For example, many district- and commune-level HIV clinics have insufficient capacity and experience for HIV care and treatment, so that essential laboratory tests to monitor ART effectiveness, such as the viral load (VL) test, are often not available. Additionally, most PLHIV, except those experiencing poverty, will be expected to pay up to 20% of costs in copayments [5]. Furthermore, owing to the lack of privacy of health care, PLHIV may face difficulties keeping their HIV status confidential if they regularly visit local HIV clinics [8, 9].",

Although previous reports have highlighted financial burden as the main barrier to SHI access [11, 18], in this study, the most frequently reported reasons for not having a SHI card were that obtaining one was burdensome and there was a lack of information about accessing SHI, rather than financial problems. In addition, two finance-related variables (individual income and employment) were not associated with lack of a SHI card in the logistic regression analyses. Various recent policies and schemes introduced by central and local government (e.g., subsidies for premiums for people living in poverty and near-poverty, allocation of local budgets for purchasing SHI cards) might have successfully contributed to the expansion of SHI. This interpretation should be tested in other settings, as our study participants at NHTD may be receiving better financial support from local government and other authorities; such support may vary between provinces depending on their financial resources and commitment to HIV prevention and control.",

A burdensome feeling could arise for various reasons, including complicated administrative procedures for SHI registration, long waiting times, or feeling that a card is not necessary [11]. As SHI cards are issued based on residential information, disclosure of HIV status to others at the time of obtaining a card may be an additional reason for not having one. Alternatively, the reported lack of information about obtaining SHI cards may reflect patient lack of interest in SHI, as well as problems related to availability and accessibility of information. In particular, it may be difficult for younger people to understand the benefits of SHI, and unmarried persons might be less motivated to enroll into SHI. As previously suggested, providing adequate information about SHI could encourage the enrollment of PLHIV in SHI [7, 11, 19]. In a previous study, we found that family is often the only and the strongest supporter of PLHIV [20]. Raising awareness of the necessity and benefits of SHI, especially among younger and unmarried individuals, and providing support tailored to individual needs (e.g., the most convenient way to register for SHI) for both patients and family could enhance the understanding of SHI enrollment and patients\u2019 willingness to join SHI and help to achieve universal SHI coverage.",

In Vietnam, the HIV epidemic is concentrated among high-risk groups (e.g., IDU and sex workers) and many PLHIV live with substantial HIV stigma [21\u201323]. Over half of the study participants live outside Hanoi, and seeking HIV services far from home is a way of keeping their HIV status confidential and avoiding the negative consequences of disclosure (e.g., effects on work and family). It is well known that HIV-related stigma is the main barrier to accessing HIV services [24, 25]. Therefore, the Vietnamese Ministry of Health issued a stigma reduction guideline in health care settings in 2017 and encouraged HIV clinics to develop an action plan for stigma reduction. However, PLHIV experience stigma from their community more frequently than from health care providers [9].",

Historically, HIV services in Vietnam have been provided through the preventive medicine system. To decentralize the HIV service delivery system, the Ministry of Health has encouraged prevention-focused facilities to sign contracts with the VSS to allow provision of and reimbursement for HIV/AIDS curative services through the SHI fund [5]. However, HIV patients do not yet trust the quality of health services at the new local facilities that have signed contracts with the VSS. Like our study participants, many PLHIV have been receiving ART at urban hospitals for a long time, and their VL has been successfully controlled [29]. In this context, it is easy to understand that PLHIV worry about being transferred to lower-level facilities just for political reasons, rather than to meet their own needs.",

This suggests that strengthening links between higher-level and lower-level facilities to continuously transfer knowledge and techniques for HIV treatment and care is a possible way to ensure the good quality of HIV services at all levels and to mitigate patients\u2019 worries and anxieties. Although NHTD and other large HIV clinics have been organizing HIV training courses for medical doctors who have just started providing HIV treatment, these are mainly classroom lectures based on project-based grants from international organizations. The Vietnamese Ministry of Health must show stronger leadership to establish an effective hospital network to promote technical assistance in more systematic and practical ways. This would certainly help to achieve 90\u201390\u201390 targets in Vietnam.",

Indeed, some participants reported that \u201cIt will influence my child\u2019s school life\u201d and \u201cIt will stress my children.\u201d Alternatively, the association between older age and having concerns about decentralization might be partly explained by the double stigma of HIV and ageism (i.e., patients are recognized as being too old to have HIV) and higher demands on the quality of health services to address multiple health complications [31]. Considering that women and older people are more likely to develop psychiatric disorders such as depression [32, 33] and anxiety [34, 35], which may be triggered by loneliness or social isolation [36, 37], more attention should be paid to their unique needs to prevent mental illness in these groups.",

These findings could contribute to the development of strategies based on patients\u2019 perspectives to successfully implement the decentralized HIV service delivery using the SHI fund. However, a few limitations should be acknowledged. First, as this was a single-center study, the participants who were receiving HIV services at a central urban hospital may not be representative of Vietnam\u2019s entire HIV population. Second, we used a cross-sectional design, which limits the extent to which causal inferences can be drawn for the associations identified. Third, as the purpose of the survey was to urgently assess the needs of HIV patients, the response options that we generated may have been too narrow to fully reflect their opinions. However, these responses were selected based on previous reports and experts\u2019 opinions about HIV in Vietnam.",
