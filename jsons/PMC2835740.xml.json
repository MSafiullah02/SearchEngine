            "text": "The rapid accumulation of scientific information continues to challenge our capacity to synthesise a collective view of knowledge in different disciplines, and hinders discover of anomalies that are unexplained or not congruent with current theories [1], [2]. Uncovering such anomalies can be a potent catalyst to translational research and recently computational discovery has shown promise in supporting these processes of knowledge synthesis and anomaly detection [3]. Text mining the scientific literature offers an opportunity to discover new relationships currently hidden within individual publications, literally \u2018joining the dots\u2019 across interdisciplinary collections [4]. For example, our current understanding of disease phenomena is inherently multi-layered, including phenome, genome, proteome and biochemical pathways [5]. The systematic association of genes and phenotypes has been a fruitful approach in biomedical knowledge discovery [6], [7], [8] and several information retrieval systems have been proposed to assist researchers in the field of human genetics and basic microbiology [9]-[15]. Such systems rely on the mining of MEDLINE text [9], [10] or employ a similarity-based inference of disease genes [11], [12]. However, they focus primarily on either molecular level host-pathogen interactions [13]\u2013[15] or pathway analysis [16] and do not link the characteristics of pathogens to clinical syndromes, which significantly limits their value for translational research. Others have undertaken unconstrained searches of this space, without reference to available biological knowledge that could direct the search for meaningful relationships [6].",

Co-occurrence was measured by the frequency with which any two entities - pathogens, infectious disease syndromes, and so on - are found in the title or abstracts of individual published, peer-reviewed manuscripts stored in PubMed. Names were based upon a standardized hierarchy of pathogens and syndromes (see SOM for detail). The domain of infectious diseases was then represented as a 2x2 matrix of associations between pathogens and clinical syndromes (Fig. 1). Each line in this \u2018heat map\u2019 visualises the pattern of syndromes linked to a single microorganism, or the pattern of microorganisms linked to a syndrome of interest (Fig. 2 and Figures S1, S2).

Pathogen-syndrome associations were time-stamped by publication date to illuminate the rise and fall of topics in infectious disease research. While the landscape in the last decades of the 20th century has been dominated by reports related to HIV and Escherichia coli (the \u201cwork horse of bacterial genomics\u201d), new trends are emerging. Specifically, respiratory tract infections due to viruses and bacteria and sepsis, bacteremia and wound infections have been reported in PubMed with greater frequency in the last decade than any other topic apart from HIV-related research. Specific examples of \u2018hot topics\u2019 included clinical syndromes caused by coronaviruses and hepatitis associated with the Ureaplasma infection. Furthermore, the use of timelines facilitates the detection of emerging infectious disease syndromes from the PubMed corpus. For example, the co-occurrence frequency of West Nile virus and \u2018encephalitis\u2019 syndrome exceeded its expected historical levels in 2000 and peaked in 2006, and the pairing of terms \u201cChikungunya virus\u201d and \u201carthritis\u201d emerged in 2007 (Fig. S4).",

Individual genes of Staphylococcus aureus were cited in 1890 abstracts or 10.8% of papers in which S. aureus was mentioned alongside infectious disease syndromes. Similarly, locus names and gene names of Mycobacterium tuberculosis were mentioned in abstracts of 340 articles or 7.3% of PubMed abstracts in which M. tuberculosis co-occurred with disease phenotypes. Figure 3 provides a snapshot of two levels of this associational landscape: the distribution of syndromes most frequently associated with different species of Mycobacteria and the selection of syndromes found to be linked to different genes in the M.tuberculosis H37Rv genome. These associations between individual genes and syndromes both recapitulate already known links but also generate new testable hypotheses that could reveal novel mechanisms of microbial virulence. For example, the role of molecular chaperones encoded by the dnaA gene in macrophage evasion has been reported after our experiment was completed [18]. Another gene identified in the study - the cell division protein gene (fts) - has been recently chosen as a new target for drug discovery [19]. These observations suggest further attention should be paid to the role of outer membrane protein A gene (ompA), - \u201ca molecular Swiss army knife\u201d [20], - in tuberculous pneumonia, as well as to the effects of the potassium uptake system, regulated by the M.tuberculosis trkB gene, in the pathogenesis of tuberculous retinitis (Fig. 3) [21].

The diversity of such pathogen signatures may allow them to be used for syndromic surveillance of pathogens [17]. These relationships were identified using point-wise mutual information scores (PMI) and then used to construct a pathogen similarity tree, which has several interesting features (Fig. 5). A subset of bacteria including staphylococci, streptococci and Pasteurella together with Pneumocystis were clustered together reflecting their association with invasive disease. These high-grade extracellular pathogens appeared to neighbour opportunistic bacteria such as Klebsiella and Enterococci, which are characterised by a relatively low propensity to cause disease but a more aggressive behaviour in situations when they reach unprotected sites (blood, tissues) or when the host immune system is defective. In contrast, the majority of virulent viruses such as Retroviridae, Picornaviridae and Myxoviridae, along with Mycobacteria, Legionella and Chlamydia, were clustered with other pathogens characterised by intracellular mechanisms of microbial survival and attack. The virulence potential of individual pathogens appears proportional to the distance from the root of the tree (Fig. 5).",

Interestingly, co-occurrence counts and PMI scores detected different phenomena with the latter identifying non-trivial associations.

Such knowledge integration should help the search for strategic and tactical targets for scientific enquiry. For example, it can guide the prioritization of microbial sequencing. Currently, there are two schools of thought about the use of high-throughput gene sequencing in microbiology. One relies on the systematic sequencing of individual representatives for every phylogenetic node of the microbial Tree of Life [25]. The other argues that the focus should be switched from indiscriminate microbial analysis to the sequencing of classes of microbes of high relevance to human health, industry or the environment. However, no specific strategies for selecting such high-relevance species of microorganisms have been offered, despite the large publicly available datasets of microbial genomes. The accelerating pace of genomic sequencing and the increasing number of genes addressed in single studies and in high-throughput experimentation means that this corpus is growing. New approaches to extracting key findings and linking them to genes are therefore urgently needed.",

It seems that geneticists focus either on pathogens with relatively short or well-characterized genomes such as viruses or E. coli. Viral genomes have attracted much sequencing effort with scores of different viruses representing Picornaviridae, Retroviridae and Caliciviridae already fully sequenced. The overrepresentation of viruses among the pathogens with completely sequenced genomes is likely to in part be a reflection of the relative ease of sequencing of them, given their genome size. Yet equally important pathogens representing Neisseria, Staphylococci and Streptococci and some epidemic parasites remain under-sequenced. The relative importance or degree of clinical and public health relevance of a pathogen can be expressed as a function of citation frequency (a proxy for importance) and of the relative frequency of syndromes co-occurring with this pathogen (Fig. S7). Such an information theoretic approach may have merit for prioritizing sequence analyses.

Such relationships can be captured and visualized by associational networks [26]. Network data structures are amenable to computational analyses which may help to uncover non-obvious properties of nodes and relationships between them. Networks of relationships suggest common mechanisms of disease between pathogens sharing common syndromes. Such analyses could provide new insights in the pathology of infectious diseases. Network topography can also imply biological similarity in disease epidemiology and is especially relevant for our understanding of polymicrobial infections. Therefore the indirect relationship and close proximity of Retroviridae with Mycobacterium nodes as well as Herpes simplex virus, Staphylococcus and Picornaviridae nodes in the network topology are of interest. It is likely that generating networks of microbial genes common to such clusters will offer specific insights about the rationale for higher-level syndrome-pathogen networks. An important capability of network representations is their capacity to relate entities of one dimension (e.g., syndromes) to entities from another dimension (pathogens) (see Fig. 6 and Fig. S4). Our approach explores the power of conducting large-scale association studies in text, and does not address finer detailed semantic issues such as negation, speculation, and context-dependent relations. Further work on the identification of semantic relationships should increase the effectiveness of text mining for hidden associations and potentially distinguish \u2018negative\u2019 associations. Natural language processing techniques such as semantic role labelling can identify predicates and their corresponding semantic arguments, leading to the uncovering of specific relations between entities, such as causation, expression, translation, and regulation [5], [8]. This level of semantic analysis should provide an opportunity to investigate more complex relations by employing inference techniques over the networked relationships that are discovered.",

Such explorations of \u201chidden public knowledge\u201d have previously made predictions that were later confirmed by experimentation [27], [28]. Many applications exist for this approach, in fields ranging from biomedicine to systems biology, where significant gaps in knowledge still exist despite an abundance of data [13], [28], [29]. The future success of these applications depends heavily on the development of infectious disease ontologies that establish hierarchies for search entities and further improvements in the accuracy of text mining classifications. Second, the genomic layer provides a biological context for the visualisation and interpretation of data, and serves as a gateway to information stored in public databases (genome map viewers such as Gbrowse) [30], GMOD [31] and biochemical pathway databases such as KEGG [32], which can be visually explored from our maps. However, there are important differences between our approach and studies that have focused on finding pathways within metabolic networks using specific enzyme and substrate names. First, such studies often rely on mining full text articles and/or curated databases [6], [13], [33], whereas we only use article abstracts. Secondly, our approach couples associations between disease phenotypes and pathogens on three levels (disease-microbial genus, disease-microbial species and disease-microbial genome). Our system should encourage researchers to leave their \u2018disease ghettoes\u2019 and break interdisciplinary barriers by linking entities that have been historically studied by different sub-disciplines of virology, mycology, parasitology, mycobacteriology, immunology and dermatology, among others.",

First, literature-wide association studies are open to publication bias [8], [9], [28], [33] and our findings confirm the high proportion of papers addressing a limited number of high-visibility infectious diseases such as HIV and tuberculosis. Second, the importance of the quality of terminology lists cannot be overstated. In this study, we have deliberately narrowed our focus to common infectious disease syndromes avoiding entities describing the individual symptoms of diseases or pathological findings, such as \u2018stridor\u2019 or \u2018epidermoplasia\u2019, for example. Thus, we have potentially limited the quality of our search output. Increasing the complexity of terminology lists would further enhance the power of analyses. Third, the specificity of the names of syndromes may be lower than the specificity of names of genes or enzymes because of the nature of molecular and clinical data [28]. The relationship between a disease phenotype and a pathogen may sometimes be ambiguous as disease phenotypes often reflect universal pathobiology and the spectrum of clinical presentations at different time-points in the natural history of a disease. However, our findings support recent observations [6], [33] that such phenotypes can still be useful for text mining. It is likely that further classification of phenotypes enriched by new standard ontologies and disease outcome entities [34] may improve this perceived specificity of disease phenotypes. Equally, because related terms appear with such high frequencies, they should often be easily resolved because of their tendency to statistically cluster.",

Names of infectious diseases syndromes or diseases uniquely associated with specific pathogens such as malaria, tuberculosis, dengue, psittacosis etc were excluded from the list. A list of microbial pathogens was compiled from the NCBI GenBank taxonomy database [36] and indexes of two authoritative reference texts in clinical microbiology and infectious diseases [37], [38]. The pathogen list (Table S5) included facultative and opportunistic pathogens of humans representing viral, prokaryotic and eukaryotic facultative and opportunistic pathogens (241 items) [39]. Lists of gene names or genomic locus names were downloaded from files of fully sequenced genomes available from the Comprehensive Microbial Resource (CMR) (http://cmr.jcvi.org/tigr-scripts/CMR/CmrHomePage.cgi). We thus identified 1119 Mycobacterium tuberculosis genes that listed both a gene symbols and locus identifiers. For example, the M. tuberculosis H37Rv genome contained 1476 such gene symbols.",
