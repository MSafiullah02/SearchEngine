Exacerbations of both asthma and COPD represent a major financial burden on the healthcare system as a result of costs associated with hospitalizations, increased medication usage, and days lost from work and school. In the case of asthma, exacerbations are responsible for 50% of the total healthcare costs, and for the deaths of 5000 Americans each year [3]. Similarly in the case of COPD, exacerbations account for 70% of healthcare costs, as well as being a substantial cause of hospitalizations [3]. More importantly, recurrent exacerbations of COPD result in a loss of lung function, thus hastening the progression of a currently fatal disease [4].",

Indeed, URIs are the principal risk factor associated with asthma exacerbations [3, 7], and are associated with as many as 80\u201385% of asthma exacerbations in children and adolescents [5, 8, 9, 10], and approximately 40\u201360% of exacerbations in adults [3, 5]. There is a clear temporal relationship between URIs and asthma exacerbations in children. The peak of hospitalizations occurs in September, shortly after the return to school and at the peak time of year for human rhinovirus (HRV) infections [10, 11]. Consistent with this, HRV is associated with approximately 60% of viral-triggered exacerbations [6, 10, 12]. Other viral types associated with asthma exacerbations include influenza, coronaviruses, parainfluenza and respiratory syncytial virus. Epidemiological evidence suggests that viruses may also interact with other causal factors linked to asthma exacerbations, such as allergens and pollution. Studies of the interaction between experimental allergen exposure and experimental virus infection, however, have generated mixed results. In a murine model, influenza infection aids allergen sensitisation and enhances airway inflammation [13]. In humans, however, chronic low-dose allergen provocations did not alter subsequent lower airway responses to HRV infection [14] whereas, in the upper airways, acute allergen challenge delayed onset and shortened the duration of common colds.",

            "text": "By 2020, COPD is predicted to become the third most common cause of death worldwide and the fifth leading cause of disability [15]. Exacerbations of COPD occur more commonly in patients in the advanced GOLD II or III stages [16]. (GOLD stands for the Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease, and ranks disease in four stages: 0 = at risk; stage I = mild COPD; stage II = moderate COPD; stage III = severe COPD.) Recent evidence has demonstrated that URIs are a major trigger [17]. In a recent study, 78% of severe exacerbations in patients with COPD were associated with viral and/or bacterial infections, with viral infections accounting for 48% of these exacerbations [18]. Interestingly, viral-associated exacerbations of COPD are more frequent, severe and have longer recovery times than those of non-viral origin [17]. Moreover, exacerbations associated with viral/bacterial co-infection also result in longer hospitalisation, and worse functional impairment for the patient [16]. In patients with COPD exacerbations requiring mechanical ventilation, a viral pathogen was detected in 46% of cases [19]. In general, viral infections are responsible for approximately 50% of exacerbations of COPD, with HRV being the dominant pathogen [3, 5]. Consistent with this, exacerbation frequency is associated with an increased frequency of acquiring the \u2018common cold\u2019 [20]. Moreover, experimental HRV infection in patients with GOLD stage II COPD resulted in symptoms and lung function changes representative of acute disease exacerbations [21].",

Growing evidence, however, suggests direct infection of the lower respiratory tract, leading to a robust host inflammatory response, and an increase in bronchial hyperresponsiveness [6]. Because HRV is the major viral type associated with exacerbations, we focus on this virus as a prototype for the mechanisms by which viruses exert their effects. HRV infects both the upper and lower respiratory tracts, with the principal site of infection being the airway epithelial cell [22]. Although it has been reported that some strains of HRV can cause epithelial cell death in cultures grown at low density [23], the majority of studies found no overt cytotoxicity either in vitro or in vivo. Epithelial cells are clearly the major site of HRV infection and sustain prolonged replication [24, 25]. Although HRV can bind to, and enter, a variety of other cell types in vitro, including fibroblasts, monocytes and macrophages [25, 26], the contribution of these individual cell types to pathogenesis in vivo is still unclear.",

This profile of mediators could enhance airway inflammation via the recruitment and retention of a wide range of inflammatory cells (Figure 1\n) that contribute to the pathogenesis of exacerbations [25]. Moreover, some of these chemokines have also been detected in airway secretions during viral infections [27]. Despite the potential for epithelial chemokines to recruit multiple cell types to the airways, experimental HRV infections and viral exacerbations of asthma and COPD are dominantly associated with selective recruitment of neutrophils and lymphocytes [4]. This implies that mechanisms must exist to limit the cell types recruited, but these mechanisms are not well understood. It has recently been reported that increased IL-10 gene expression is observed during viral exacerbations of asthma, suggesting that immunoregulatory effects of IL-10 include suppression of eosinophil influx [28].",

Induction of chemokines such as IL-8 occurs early after HRV binding and does not require viral replication, but instead depends upon activation of both phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase and the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway [30]. Given that intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1), the receptor for the majority of HRV serotypes, has no inherent kinase activity or recognition motifs for receptor-associated kinases, it was unclear how viral binding initiated this signalling cascade. However, it has recently been shown that HRV binding to ICAM-1 leads to an association with the spleen tyrosine kinase Syk. This association is mediated via the cytoskeletal linker protein ezrin, which binds both ICAM-1 and Syk. Formation of this complex leads to activation of Syk, with subsequent downstream activation of the p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway and increased expression of IL-8. Thus, Syk is an important signalling component in early virus responses [31\u2022\u2022].",

            "text": "In contrast to the rapid generation of IL-8, other responses to viral infection, such as generation of RANTES or IP-10, do not occur until several hours after viral exposure and are absolutely dependent upon viral replication. This has led to intense investigation of the role of viral replication products, particularly double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), in cell responses. It is known that dsRNA mimics several responses to viral infection and triggers host anti-viral responses. Initially, dsRNA was thought to be recognized exclusively by Toll-like receptor (TLR)3 [32], but genetic deletion of TLR3 did not alter viral pathogenesis or host adaptive antiviral responses to several viruses [33]. This apparent conundrum was resolved with the demonstration that two intracellular RNA helicases \u2014 retinoic acid inducible gene (RIG-I) [34, 35\u2022\u2022] and melanoma-differentiation-associated gene 5 (mda-5) [35\u2022\u2022] \u2014 can also bind to dsRNA. The helicase domain of these proteins binds dsRNA, while a caspase activation and recruitment domain (CARD) permits binding of a downstream adaptor protein. This downstream mitochondrial-associated protein was identified independently by four groups and is known by the names CARDIF (CARD adapter inducing interferon-\u03b2), MAVS (mitochondrial antiviral signalling), IPS-1 (interferon-\u03b2 promoter stimulator-1) and VISA (virus-induced signalling adapter) [36\u2022]. CARDIF binds to several proteins and induces both classical nuclear factor-\u03baB (NF-\u03baB) pathway activation and IKK\u025b/Tank-binding kinase 1-mediated activation of interferon response factors [36\u2022]. These pathways are also activated when dsRNA binds to TLR3 (Figure 2\n). Controversy now exists regarding the relative roles of TLR3, RIG-I and mda-5 in viral recognition. It has been suggested that different viral types may preferentially utilize one of these three recognition proteins. To further complicate this picture, RIG-I also recognizes single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) containing 5\u2032-phosphates. Indeed, it has been reported that influenza A does not generate dsRNA but, rather, activates RIG-I via binding of genomic viral ssRNA bearing 5\u2032-phosphates [37\u2022, 38\u2022]. Further studies are needed to clarify the preferential utilization of different intracellular recognition molecules by different viral types, and to determine if this also varies with cell type.",

Those subjects whose underlying disease is well controlled are less likely to experience an acute viral-mediated exacerbation. Similarly, pre-existing specific immunity to a given pathogen will reduce the likelihood of that pathogen triggering an exacerbation. Epithelial contributions to host innate antiviral immunity might also play a role. Recent reports suggest that bronchial epithelial cells from asthmatic subjects show impaired production of both IFN\u03b2 and type 3 IFNs [39\u2022\u2022, 40\u2022\u2022], and that this plays a role in the increased susceptibility of asthmatic subjects to lower airway disease. Additional studies are needed to confirm these data and to put such defects in the context of why specific asthmatic subjects experience exacerbations. Moreover, although type 1 and type 3 IFNs contribute to host defence mainly via induction of numerous IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) that collectively limit virus replication and spread, there is a precedent for several viruses, including HRV, to induce ISGs independently of IFN induction [24, 41].",

Corticosteroids are ineffective in the treatment of HRV-induced colds and current evidence would suggest that they are of limited efficacy in viral-induced excerbations of asthma. Asthmatics with prominent sputum neutrophilia, perhaps indicative of viral etiology, are poorly responsive to inhaled corticosteroids [45], and inhaled corticoisteroids did not significantly reduce lower airway inflammation induced by HRV infection of asthmatic subjects [46]. Moreover, administration of prednisolone to children hospitalized for viral-induced episodes of wheezy bronchiolitis did not reduce the duration of hospital stay [47]. Combination therapies of inhaled anticholinergic agents with short-acting \u03b22-adrenoceptor agonists have been reported to be more effective against exacerbations in school children [44]; furthermore, a leukotriene receptor antagonist decreased asthma exacerbations in 2- to 5-year-old patients with intermittent asthma [48]. Nedocromil sodium and inhaled corticosteroids might also be of limited benefit in asthma exacerbations in children [49].

Combined therapy with corticosteroids and long-acting \u03b2-adrenoceptor agonists has been shown to reduce the number of exacerbations in patients with COPD, presumably by improving baseline control [50]. Again, however, there have been no studies specifically examining the effects of corticosteroids, alone or in combination with long-acting \u03b2-adrenoceptor agonists, during COPD exacerbations of known viral etiology. Similarly, although antibiotic therapy is widely used in exacerbations of COPD, their utility in virally triggered exacerbations is questionable.",

These could include, for example, specific early signaling pathways involving the spleen tyrosine kinase Syk, or pathways triggered by viral interactions with the intracellular RNA helicases. Although targeting specific chemokines or chemokine receptors, such as CXCR3 or CXCR1/2, might also prove an attractive target, it remains to be determined which chemokine/chemokine-receptor systems are particularly important in disease pathogenesis. Finally, enhancement of endogenous host antiviral pathways, or topical administration of drugs such as nitric oxide donors, could provide alternative approaches to reduce virally induced inflammation.",
