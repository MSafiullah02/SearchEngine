The chi-square test (for categorical variables) and Wilcoxon test (for continuous variables) were used to compare patient characteristics and pretransplant factors. Pearson correlation coefficient was used for correlation analyses. OS was calculated from the day of transplantation (day 0) until death. Relapse-free survival (RFS) was calculated from the day of transplantation until the detection of persistent or relapsed disease after transplant. OS and RFS were estimated using the Kaplan\u2013Meier method. The log-rank test and Cox proportional hazard models were used to analyze the relationships of patient characteristics and transplant variables with OS and RFS. Patient\u2019s demographic, clinical, and laboratory characteristics were all considered in the multivariate survival analysis if they were significant relative to patient\u2019s survival time (p < 0.05) by univariate survival analysis. Backward variable selection in the Cox proportional hazard models was used. Forty-eight and 44 patients were included in the overall and relapse-free survival analyses, respectively.

One third of the patients in this study did not appear to benefit from TBI-MEL, and four died within the first 2 months following the transplant. The limited sample size precludes any definitive conclusions relating to risk factors predictive of disease response; however, in this series, younger age and remission status following SCT appeared to be associated with overall survival and warrant further investigation.

Of note, high LDH levels (>500 IU/L) at the time of transplant was a stronger predictor of relapse than a low platelet count. Whether these pretransplant predictors of LDH and platelet count having a general utility will require larger multicenter studies evaluating this regimen. Another potential predictor of relapse was the presence of circulating malignant cells at the time of SCT, although we could not demonstrate a significant difference in RFS (p = 0.08) and OS (p = 0.06) between patients with and without circulating blasts. We suspect that this was probably due to small sample size. The median survival time of patients with circulating blasts was notably shorter (3 vs. 10.8 months) as compared to those without circulating blast at stem cell transplantation (SCT). Therefore, leukemia patients with circulating blasts are probably not suitable candidates for SCT using TBI-MEL conditioning alone.",

Both patient characteristics and transplant outcomes were similar to what was appreciated using the TBI-MEL regimen. Forty-six adult patients, including 31 patients with nonremission AML, received this myeloablative conditioning. Toxicity was acceptable. Complete remission was achieved in 80 % of all patients by day 30 and in 100 % of AML patients without prior hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.
