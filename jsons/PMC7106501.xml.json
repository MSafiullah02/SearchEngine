The number of journeys taken by passengers each year has grown from approximately 642 million in 1980 to more than 3\u00b74 billion in 2015.1 The epidemiology of infectious diseases associated with air travel and the challenges of infection control are important public health concerns, yet they are scarcely discussed in the literature.2 Aircraft can now travel to almost any part of the world within 24 h, and can enable spread of infection either by in-flight infection transmission or by transporting infectious passengers or vectors\u2014eg, malaria-infected mosquitoes\u2014from endemic to non-endemic regions, thus putting populations in destination countries at risk. The combination of rising passenger numbers, new travel destinations, and on-board transmission events can influence transmission patterns of several imported diseases, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and Ebola virus disease.3 For example, the ongoing transmission of Zika virus disease is believed to have been introduced to the Americas by air travel.4 Management of these risks requires knowledge of the dynamics of infectious disease transmission and the potential effectiveness of control measures, suggesting that frontline employees (eg, airline staff) would need appropriate training to handle suspected disease cases.",

The flight had originated in London. A passenger who regularly travelled on this route objected to being sprayed with insecticide, pointing to potentially dangerous adverse health effects. He added that, having travelled with different airlines, he had not witnessed any in-flight spraying for years.

Third, additional research and investment into airport health screening measures is required to better identify infectious passengers. Disease transmission can be minimised if passengers take appropriate precautions before or during a flight, or refrain from flying altogether when ill. Current education and communication strategies (and refund policies for missed flights) therefore warrant improvement. Fourth, these measures cannot be implemented in the absence of enforceable and harmonised international legislation and governance. Achieving this goal will be a major challenge, but a starting point could be for international or regional bodies\u2014such as WHO or the European Union\u2014to produce model legislation or standards for the guidance of member states.
