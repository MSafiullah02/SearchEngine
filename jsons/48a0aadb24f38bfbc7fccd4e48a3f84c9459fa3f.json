            "text": "Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has placed an unprecedented strain on health systems, with rapidly increasing demand for healthcare in hospitals and intensive care units (ICUs) worldwide. As the pandemic escalates, determining the resulting needs for healthcare resources (beds, staff, equipment) has become a key priority for many countries. Projecting future demand requires estimates of how long patients with COVID-19 need different levels of hospital care. Methods: We performed a systematic review to gather data on length of stay (LoS) of patients with COVID-19 in hospital and in ICU. We subsequently developed a method to generate LoS distributions which combines summary statistics reported in multiple studies, accounting for differences in sample sizes. Applying this approach we provide distributions for general hospital and ICU LoS from studies in China and elsewhere, for use by the community. Results: We identified 52 studies, the majority from China (46/52). Median hospital LoS ranged from 4 to 53 days within China, and 4 to 21 days outside of China, across 45 studies. ICU LoS was reported by eight studies -four each within and outside China -with median values ranging from 6 to 12 and 4 to 19 days, respectively. Our summary distributions have a median hospital LoS of 14 (IQR: 10-19) days for China, compared with 5 (IQR: 3-9) days outside of China. For ICU, the summary distributions are more similar (median (IQR) of 8 (5-13) days for China and 7 (4-11) days outside of China). There was a visible difference by discharge status, with patients who were discharged alive having longer LoS than those who died during their admission, but no trend associated with study date. Conclusion: Patients with COVID-19 in China appeared to remain in hospital for longer than elsewhere. This may be explained by differences in criteria for admission and discharge between countries, and different timing within the pandemic. In the absence of local data, the combined summary LoS distributions provided here can be used to model bed demands for contingency planning and then updated, with the novel method presented here, as more studies with aggregated statistics emerge outside China.",

            "text": "COVID-19 presents at varying levels of severity. Hospital care can vary from general ward based care to high dependency units with oxygen support to intensive care where patients may be intubated for mechanical ventilation [8] [9] [10] . The LoS is likely to depend on the level of care required, as well as the geographic setting due to varying COVID-19 care guidelines. For example, some hospitals in China were initially used as isolation settings [11, 12] . As knowledge of effective treatments changes, the pathways, staff, beds and equipment required are also likely to affect the duration and level of care needed. Moreover, patient characteristics -such as age and comorbidities -impact disease severity [8, [12] [13] [14] and are likely to influence LoS. If differences are significant then capacity planning may need to account for these characteristics to provide accurate predictions of the number of beds required at each level of care. Modelling studies predicting bed occupancy published so far have broadly relied on very few sources of information for LoS estimates, which were often derived from very different settings [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] . Estimates for LoS can be obtained from a variety of studies, but are often an incidental result rather than a study's primary outcome, and typically only summary statistics are reported. In general, LoS distributions are right-skewed due to a minority of patients with long hospital stays and are often modelled using gamma, log-normal or weibull distributions [23] (although log-normal is less preferred due to its heavier tails). A particular challenge is how to synthesise appropriate LoS distributions from a range of relevant sources in similar settings, capturing the variation both within and between them. Incorporating the uncertainty and stochasticity in parameters using a distribution, rather than fixed point estimates (such as the mean over all studies), allows for more realistic model predictions.",

The same approach was also tested using gamma distributions, but Weibull was marginally preferred with respect to total squared error in the fitted quantiles. These distributions were then discretised using the distcrete package in R [25] . 100,000 samples were then drawn from each of these distributions, with weighting according to their sample size. Specifically, the study distributions were first sampled according to a multinomial distribution defined by the studies' relative sample sizes, and LoS was then sampled from each of these sampled distributions. Due to potential important differences in the characteristics of each study population, it may not be appropriate to weight entirely on sample size without considering how representative the cohort is of the general population. Therefore, as a sensitivity analysis, we performed the same analysis without weighting in order to understand how much this influences the distribution.",

This review found that hospital LoS observations for COVID-19 patients published in the literature to date varied from less than a week to nearly two months. Stay in intensive care was shorter and less variable, with studies reporting medians of one to three weeks. Where LoS was reported according to discharge status, stay was found to be shorter for those who died than for those discharged alive; however, this difference was only apparent in terms of overall stay and not stay in ICU (no statistical comparison was made). With respect to practical implications, knowledge of a difference between survivors and non-survivors is of less use since the outcome will not be known in advance in order to influence decision-making.",

The included studies yield some evidence of a difference between total hospital LoS observed in China and outside of China, with shorter LoS reported in the latter group (14 days (10-19) versus 5 days (3-9), respectively). However, only five studies were identified which reported LoS outside of China therefore this comparison is somewhat inconclusive. It may be that LoS is longer in China compared with other settings due to different criteria for hospital admission and discharge. A consensus exists across guidelines, such as ensuring resolution of symptoms and evidence of two negative PCR samples at least 24 hours apart before discharge [47, 48] , however, differences between settings may arise as a result of local capacity and strain on the health system. We attempted to capture this difference by recording time from onset of symptoms to admission, however, only one study outside of China reported this and a comparison was not possible. It is also possible that, with foresight from witnessing the Chinese epidemic, other countries set less strict criteria for discharge, in anticipation of stretched capacity. Other countries may also have used evidence from China to improve treatment methods and hence shorten LoS. However, this unfortunately appears unlikely as we did not observe a trend when looking at the reported LoS estimates over time.",

At the beginning of the outbreak and in certain settings, hospitals were being used to isolate patients who were unable to isolate effectively at home [11, 12] . This means that LoS for patients in some of the earlier studies within this dataset could have been longer due this logistical reason, rather than clinical need. Studies which mentioned this explicitly were excluded, yet there may still be others which were not so transparent. In addition, it is possible that, as hospitals reach the limits of their capacity, a more stringent triage policy may be implemented and the most critical patients may not be transferred to ICU.

[53] investigated the bias associated with estimating average ICU LoS for COVID-19 patients based on observed LoS of discharged patients before follow-up of the entire patient cohort was completed. As expected, the authors found that the average LoS estimated at three months of follow-up was much longer than that estimated at one month. This potentially affects our estimates, given that 37 (out of 52) studies had incomplete follow-up with regards to LoS; although on comparison the difference between the groups was slight, and estimates where follow-up was complete were overall shorter. Several studies included still-hospitalised patients in their LoS summary without accounting for censoring [33, 34, [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] , which potentially alters interpretation of the values.",

Many of these studies published so far have used point estimates, only originating from one study which often does not reflect the context of interest. In particular, many used estimates from Zhou et al. [55] which reported a shorter general hospital LoS (median 11\u00b70, IQR 7\u00b70-14\u00b70; Fig. 2) , and a comparable ICU LoS (median 8\u00b70, IQR 4\u00b70-12\u00b70; Fig. 3 ), compared with other studies from China. However, both of these were still longer than LoS estimates reported by studies outside of China. This means that the bed-forecasting studies relying on LoS estimates from Zhou et al. may be overestimating the number of beds required. The LoS estimate is a critical parameter within a bed forecasting model, and as such any model is likely to be very sensitive to the value or distribution being assumed, with huge implications for policy and planning.",

This gives a motivation for considering a wider range of values than can be obtained in a single study, aiming instead to capture the overall distribution of LoS across a variety of possible patient trajectories.

Furthermore, LMICs may have reduced capacity for surveillance and monitoring in order to obtain these data. In such cases, where countries are in the early stages of an outbreak, it would be better to use a conservative (i.e broad) distribution of LoS from another setting. As the pandemic progresses and more countries observe patients completing their hospital episodes, it will be possible to add further setting-specific summaries and improve this distribution.",

We present an intuitive method which exploits two optimisation methods to fit parametric distributions based on reported summary statistics rather than individual data, then samples across them. In this way we capture the central tendency and overall variation between a set of quantiles from different study populations. This allows multiple sources of evidence to be consolidated into a single distribution which can be used in bed forecasting going forward. By providing both the code for this analysis and our summary distributions, better bed occupancy predictions can be made in the future.",

We found substantial differences between China and other settings in terms of total hospital stay, but little evidence for an impact on LoS of time of study, age or disease severity. We present summary distributions which can be used within models making predictions about bed requirements, and suggest that this may be a more robust and realistic way to characterise LoS than relying on summary data from just one setting or hospital. The majority of the data presented in this review comes from China and, as more data become available, it will be important to update this with setting-specific LoS estimates. Understanding the duration of hospitalisation of COVID-19 patients is critical for providing insights as to when hospitals will reach capacity, as well predicting associated staff or equipment requirements.",
