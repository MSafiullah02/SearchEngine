            "text": "Trichomonads inhabit a variety of vertebrate hosts and consist of both pathogenic and presumably nonpathogenic species (Lopez et al., 2000). These protozoa are obligate parasites of warm, moist, and anaerobic locations within the gastrointestinal and genitourinary tract (Felleisen, 1999). In dogs and cats, trichomonads were initially thought to be only opportunistic commensals. However, in 2003 the pathogen Tritrichomonas foetus was identified as a cause of large bowel diarrhea in the cat (Levy et al., 2003). Both T. foetus and an unrelated trichomonad, Pentatrichomonas hominis have been infrequently reported in dogs and their pathogenicity is unknown (Gookin et al., 2005, Gookin et al., 2007, Kim et al., 2010). In particular, P. hominis is presumed to be a commensal that may overgrow in dogs with other causes of diarrhea. It is unclear if T. foetus or P. hominis is more common in dogs with trichomonosis or how often these infections are accompanied by concurrent infections.",

Each extract of fecal DNA was then subjected to single-tube nested PCR amplification of a 208-bp sequence of the partial internal transcribed spacer region (ITSR) 1 and 5.8S rRNA gene of T. foetus using previously published reaction conditions and primer sequences (Gookin et al., 2005). Amplicons migrating at 208-bp based on gel electrophoresis were digested with ApoI (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA) at 50 \u00b0C for 90 min. Electrophoresis of 10 \u03bcl of each digest in a 3.5% agarose gel containing ethidium bromide was performed to confirm the presence of specific confirmatory bands at 89 and 119-bp (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). Each DNA extract was subjected to PCR amplification of a 339-bp sequence of partial 18S rRNA gene of P. hominis using previously published reaction conditions and primer sequences (Gookin et al., 2007). Amplification products of the appropriate size were submitted for purification and bi-directional DNA sequencing (MCLAB, San Francisco, CA). Finally, DNA extracts that tested negative for T. foetus and P. hominis rRNA genes were assayed for the presence of DNA sequences sharing common identity with a larger number of trichomonadida. PCR amplification of 339 to 372-bp sequences of partial ITS1, 5.8S, and ITS2 rRNA gene was performed using primers TFR1 and TFR2 designed by Felleisen (1997). The PCR assay was performed in a 100 uL reaction volume using 1x PCR Buffer II, 2.5 units of Taq polymerase, 100 pmol of each primer, 200uM of each deoxynucleoside triphosphate, 10 \u03bcg of bovine serum albumin, 6.25 mM MgCl, and 5 \u03bcL of DNA. DNA amplification was performed under the following thermocycling conditions: 5 min of initial denaturation at 95 \u00b0C, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation at 95 \u00b0C for 30-s, annealing at 66 \u00b0C for 30-s and extension at 72 \u00b0C for 90-s, and a final extension at 72 \u00b0C for 15-min.",

It remains unclear which trichomonads are more common in dogs and whether these infections are more or less likely to be accompanied by other possible infectious explanations for diarrhea. The present study examined fecal samples from 38 dogs that were submitted for T. foetus PCR testing. While the reason for sample submission was not clear in every case, where reported 100% of these dogs had diarrhea and 88% had flagellates observed at the time of a direct fecal examination. Among these dogs, 50% had trichomonosis verified by means of PCR amplification of P. hominis or T. foetus rRNA genes from feces. Trichomonal infection in these dogs was attributed to P. hominis far more frequently than to T. foetus. This finding provides objective data to support prior assumptions that most commonly trichomonosis in dogs is due to P. hominis infection. Five dogs in the study had flagellates reportedly observed in feces but were PCR-negative for trichomonadida. Whether these samples contained non-trichomonad flagellates, trichomonads not identified by our PCR assays, or represented false negative test results is unknown. Because our sample population included only dogs that were suspected of having trichomonosis, future prospective studies will be necessary to establish a true prevalence of trichomonosis in dogs with diarrhea.",

Consequently, P. hominis is presumed to be a commensal that may overgrow in the intestinal tract of dogs with other causes for their diarrhea. An additional aim of this study was to examine the occurrence of concurrent gastrointestinal infections in dogs identified with P. hominis infection compared to those dogs in which trichomonosis was not identified. Since we were limited to the testing of fecal DNA from each dog, each sample was tested for a battery of known canine enteropathogens by means of real-time TaqMan\u00ae PCR. There were no obvious differences in the specific identity, percentage of dogs identified with or total number of concurrent enteropathogens between dogs with and without P. hominis infection. These findings would suggest that dogs with P. hominis are as likely as dogs without P. hominis to have a plausible non-trichomonad enteropathogen responsible for their diarrhea. It remains unclear however, if any of the concurrent infectious agents identified on the PCR panel was ultimately responsible for clinical signs of diarrhea in these dogs. In this regard we included a control group of dogs without diarrhea to determine the likelihood that the PCR panel could distinguish between dogs with and without presumably infectious diarrhea. The number of enteropathogens identified in the control dogs was consistently lower than that in the dogs with diarrhea, but interpretation of these findings is unconvincing because of the limited number of samples available. Accordingly, larger numbers of dogs with and without P. hominis infection will be needed to definitively answer the question of disease causation or alternatively, the pathogenic potential of P. hominis could be defined by means of experimental infection studies.",

Reported ages of dogs with trichomonosis and diarrhea have ranged from 7 weeks to 6 months (Gookin et al., 2007, O\u2019Donnell, 1954, Bruce, 1941, Turnwald et al., 1988). It is noteworthy that trichomonosis was diagnosed in dogs as old as 10 years of age in the present study. The two dogs identified with T. foetus infection were also adult dogs (2 and 4.5 years of age). We were also surprised at the number of German Shepherd Dogs identified with P. hominis infection in this study although this finding could be easily attributed to overrepresentation by a single facility from which 7/8 of the P. hominis positive German Shepherd Dogs were housed. On the other hand, German Shepherd Dogs have been the subject of at least three independent reports of dogs with trichomonosis and diarrhea where infections were documented in a single dog, a litter of puppies, and a working dog facility respectively (Gookin et al., 2005, Kim et al., 2010, O\u2019Donnell, 1954). Further investigation of German Shepherd Dogs for a possible breed predisposition to P. hominis infection or shedding of P. hominis secondary to primary gastrointestinal disease appears to be warranted.",
