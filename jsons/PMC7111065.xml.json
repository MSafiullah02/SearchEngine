            "text": "Noroviruses are the number 1 cause of foodborne illness around the world, producing extensive outbreaks of gastroenteritis that attract media attention and raise concern of healthcare professionals and consumers. About 58% of domestically-acquired foodborne illnesses, 26% of hospitalizations and 11% deaths are attributable to noroviruses [1]. The complete scope of foodborne diseases is hard to tackle, however building capacity to detect, control and prevent them is an urgent matter. Gastroenteritis remains an important health issue that affects all age groups but can be particularly severe for children, the elderly and immunocompromised. In developing countries, still today, one million children die annually before they reach the age of five due to diarrhea [2]. Of those, \u223c200 000 deaths are estimated to be caused by noroviruses [3]. The introduction of vaccines against rotavirus had in recent years a major impact on reducing the total number of deaths due to diarrhea; however the set Millennium Development Goal 4 is still far from being attained [2]. Noroviruses are currently the most important pathogen causing severe childhood diarrhea in countries where vaccination against rotavirus is routinely implemented [4]. It is the reason for 1 million pediatric medical care visits annually in the United States [4]. Conversely, the elderly account for the majority of gastroenteritis-associated hospitalizations and deaths [5]. Indeed, norovirus gastroenteritis is linked with increased risk of hospitalization and mortality in the elderly population (in spite of remaining underestimated) and thus should not be regarded as a trivial illness of short duration [5], [6]. Long-term care facilities are the most common setting for norovirus outbreaks, followed by restaurants, schools, hospitals and cruise ships [7]. Noroviruses are a major culprit for the closure of hospital wards [8]. Nearly 4000 hospital outbreaks were reported in the UK in a 2-year period, affecting \u223c13 000 patients and \u223c3400 staff members and resulting in almost 9000 days of ward closure [9].",

However, prolonged and severe disease \u2013 including dehydrating diarrhea \u2013 occurs in vulnerable populations (children, elderly and immunocompromised). Post-infectious functional gastrointestinal disorders such as irritable bowel syndrome have been reported after norovirus gastroenteritis [11]. Other reported sequelae include necrotizing enterocolitis, convulsions and encephalopathy [12], [13], [14]. Detection of norovirus in the serum of patients has been scarcely reported, but the significance of such findings is not yet well understood. In immunocompromised individuals norovirus gastroenteritis can become chronic and persist for weeks to years, having an estimated prevalence of 17\u201318% [15]. Indeed, an increasing number of studies show that immunosuppressive therapy is a risk factor for norovirus infection [15]. Such patients often present dramatic weight loss due to prolonged norovirus-related diarrhea which together with malnutrition, dehydration, and altered intestinal mucosal barrier may contribute to increased morbidity and aggravate the outcome of underlying disease [16]. Transplant recipients with such chronic norovirus infections may require adjustment (reduction) of immunosuppressive therapy [15].",

The main route of transmission in over 70% of outbreaks is person-to-person [7] thus favoring the occurrence of large outbreaks in semi-closed environments. The extensiveness of such outbreaks is explained by the low infectious dose of norovirus (18 virus particles are sufficient for infection), with shedding in stool for 20 to 40 days (also present in asymptomatic individuals) and by its long persistence in the environment (resistance to disinfectants, heating, freezing), up to two weeks on surfaces [17], [18], [19]. In addition, norovirus infections can occur repeatedly through life due to lack of complete cross-protection against the diverse norovirus strains and the lack of long-lasting immunity [10].",

Other tentative genera have been proposed following the characterization of the simian Tulane virus, the porcine St. Val\u00e9rian virus and the avian Bayern virus. The two genera Norovirus and Sapovirus comprise human viruses that cause gastroenteritis, while the other genera represent animal viruses [10]. Noroviruses are divided into six genogroups based on the amino acid sequence diversity of the major structural protein VP1, of which genogroup I (GI) is further divided into 9 genotypes and GII into 22 genotypes. The (human) Norwalk virus is the prototype of the genus and is designated GI.1; while human pathogens are found in GI, GII and (rarely) GIV, GIII comprises bovine and ovine strains and GV murine noroviruses. In addition, swine strains are classified into GII and canine strains into GIV and GVI [20]. Due to the close genetic relatedness of humans and animal noroviruses, plus the detection of antibodies to animal strains in humans and to human strains in pigs, the possibility of a zoonotic transmission has been raised [21]. In humans, GII.4 noroviruses cause the vast majority of outbreaks; novel GII.4 variants have emerged and become globally predominant multiple times in the past decades [18], [22]. This cyclic emergence of novel strains and displacement of the previously predominant ones, causing worldwide epidemics suggests a pattern of epochal evolution resembling that of influenza [23].",

While ORF1, in the 5\u2032 end, encodes a polyprotein of six/seven nonstructural protein products, ORF2 and 3 encode the major and minor structural capsid proteins VP1 and VP2, respectively. Murine norovirus (MNV) genomes comprise an additional ORF4, which encodes virulence factor 1 (VF1) [24], [25]. The viral protein VPg (virion protein, genome-linked) is covalently linked to the 5\u2032 end of the norovirus genome, which is polyadenlyated at the 3\u2032 end [10]. The ORF1 of norovirus encodes the six/seven nonstructural proteins in the following order: the p48/N-terminal protein (or NS1-2), the NTPase (NS3), the p22 (NS4), the VPg (NS5), the viral protease (Pro, NS6), and the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp, NS7). Virions contain 180 copies or 90 dimers of VP1, the major structural protein, that assemble into icosahedral particles. The VP1 protein is divided into a conserved internal shell domain (S) and a more variable protruding domain, the P domain, which forms the arch-like protrusions. Its P2 subdomain is located at the outmost surface of the viral capsid and comprises a hypervariable region, where resides the binding interface for histo-blood group antigen (HBGA) association with norovirus. The VP2 is a small basic structural protein which is present in one or two copies per virion and associates with the VP1 S domain at the interior surface of the capsid, being likely involved in the capsid assembly and genome encapsidation [26]. Norovirus virus-like particles (VLPs) formed by the independent expression and self-assembly of the VP1 are morphologically and antigenically indistinguishable from the native forms of viruses found in human stools, and retain the binding properties of native norovirus virions at least in terms of carbohydrate association.",

There is limited knowledge of the immune response against human norovirus, most of which derives from volunteer studies. The inability to measure serum or intestinal secretory neutralizing antibodies in tissue culture has made it hard to study protective immunity. Such studies, performed with multiple norovirus genotypes had variable outcomes, being likely affected by pre-exposure history of volunteers [27]. Short-term immunity was demonstrated and likely virus or serotype specific, while long-term immunity has been harder to put in evidence.

Clinical efficacy studies with Norwalk virus VLPs administered intranasally (two doses three weeks apart) to healthy adult volunteers showed homotypic protection [30]. The vaccine reduced the frequency of Norwalk virus gastroenteritis (69% of placebo recipients vs. 37% of vaccine recipients) and specific IgA antibodies were detected in high levels in 70% of vaccine recipients. The optimal antigen dose, route of administration, adjuvants and type of norovirus strains present in a norovirus vaccine are yet to be determined. Other important aspects to address are whether there is immunogenicity and protective efficacy in the elderly population and young children and primarily the duration of protective immunity of such vaccine. This could become a major challenge given the great antigenic and genetic diversity of noroviruses and the practical usefulness of the vaccine requiring a one-year minimum of protective immunity to be feasible. More recently, a GI.1/GII.4 bivalent VLP vaccine (two doses, intramuscular injection) has been carried out (NCT01168401, www.clinicaltrials.gov); however, results have not yet been officially disclosed. In any case, these trials constitute an important step to the feasibility of a norovirus vaccine. Conversely, the need for specific antiviral therapy remains in the case of chronically infected immunocompromised patients, elderly or children with severe on-going infections and prophylactic control of fast-growing outbreaks.",

These include the porcine enteric calicivirus (PEC), a Sapovirus, the feline calicivirus (FCV), a Vesivirus and the Tulane Virus, tentatively a Recovirus (Table 1\n). While these viruses have been used in persistence and inactivation studies, the differences in terms of genome organization, route of infection and pathogenesis make them far from ideal for human norovirus antiviral drug discovery. The more closely related murine norovirus, a GV norovirus has been more widely used and is to date the only Norovirus known to replicate in a cell line and small animal model (Table 1) [31], [32]. This virus has allowed the study of multiple aspects of norovirus biology and is presently considered a central tool for antiviral studies of human norovirus [33]. The genome of MNV has the three ORFs characteristic of noroviruses; the ORF1 encodes the nonstructural proteins and ORFs 2 and 3 encode the structural proteins VP1 and VP2. It has however the additional ORF4 that overlaps with ORF2 in a different reading frame and encodes VF1, a protein involved in the host innate immune response [24], [25]. The similarities in genome organization, protein function and structure allow to assume that the fundamental aspects of MNV and human norovirus replication are highly conserved [33]. Furthermore, MNV replicates in mice, spreads through the fecal-oral route and is shed at high levels in the feces. It is thus an enteric virus, capable of inducing gastroenteritis, with similarities in pathogenesis to human norovirus [31], [32].",

It should be mentioned that in this study only Norwalk virus and no other human norovirus strains were employed. Similar efforts to cultivate human norovirus in human and murine cell lines of hematopoietic origin remained also unsuccessful [39].

Large-animal models for the porcine sapovirus (PEC/Cowden strain) replicating in swine, or the Tulane virus replicating in rhesus macaques, also provide an opportunity to study clinical features and pathogenesis of caliciviruses [45], [46]. All of the 30 known strains of murine norovirus replicate in mice. The majority of these cause a persistent asymptomatic infection in immunocompetent mice (Table 2) [24]. However, in mice lacking components of innate immunity such as signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1) or alpha/beta (IFN-\u03b1/\u03b2) and gamma (IFN-\u03b3) interferon receptors, MNV can cause either a persistent or an acute and lethal infection. When infected with the MNV-1 strain innate immunity deficient mice develop severe diarrhea and weight loss, with \u223c100% mortality four to nine days after infection [31], [32]. Viral RNA is detected in these mice in high levels in the intestine, lung, liver, spleen, brain, blood, and feces. The clinical symptoms observed are severe pneumonia and destruction of splenic and liver tissues that cause fatal disease in most cases [31]. This mortality model displays features similar to the pathogenesis of human norovirus infection in humans namely, infection via the oral route, diarrhea, gastric bloating, shedding in stool in high levels [31], [47]. Two MNV-1 variants were selected from the initially isolated virus by plaque purification and passaging in cell culture, MNV-1.CW1 (P3) and MNV-1.CW3 (P3), which genetically differ in four amino acids [32], [47]. Only MNV-1.CW3 is equally virulent as the parental strain in immunocompromised mice. MNV-1.CW1 is attenuated and detected in vivo solely at 24 h pi [47]. In immunocompetent mice, however, MNV-1.CW3 infection causes modest intestinal pathology and fecal inconsistency, which is cleared in less than one week [48].",

The MNV-3 causes mild symptoms in STAT1-deficient mice, in comparison with the CW3 strain, with less weight loss and more moderate gastric bloating and fecal inconsistency, being cleared after one week. In wild-type mice MNV-3 infection is asymptomatic and can persist for weeks to months [49], [51]. Conversely, the CR6 strain persists asymptomatically in both wild-type and innate immune-deficient mice, presenting thus a different phenotype [52]. These (and potentially other) persistent MNV strains may be used as a model to study norovirus persistence. This might also become useful for antiviral studies given the increased recognition of prolonged norovirus infections in immunocompromised patients.",

Here, a conformational pocket on the distal surface of the viral capsid interacts with individual oligosaccharide residues of the HBGA molecules.

This approach, in which \u223c2 million chemical structures were screened in silico for their potential to compete with HBGA binding, resulted in the identification of several compounds that could block the HBGA-P domain interaction in vitro (Fig. 1\n) [56].

Based on sequence similarity it is thought to be comparable to the picornavirus 2B protein, which participates in intracellular membrane changes that follow infection. In the case of Norwalk virus infection p48 seems to interfere with disassembly of the Golgi complex and cellular protein trafficking [65]. Studies with MNV reveal that p48 is associated with the recruitment of ER membranes to the site of replication [66]. This recruitment of membranes is probably vital for the formation of replication complexes and the synthesis of new viral proteins [32], [64]. More recently the N-terminal domain of the p48 was shown to determine virus colonic tropism and persistence [50]. As the exact mechanism is still unknown, it is speculated that structural differences of a novel protein fold in the N-terminal domain of p48 influences cellular pathways during viral infection, resulting in evasion of immunity and consequently viral persistence [67]. Given its pleiotropic functions, the mechanisms controlled by p48 in the membrane rearrangements could be a good strategy to stop the norovirus life cycle.",

In contrast with the VPg proteins of picornaviruses that seem to have an intrinsically disordered structure, the VPg protein of MNV contains \u03b1-helical cores flanked by long unstructured termini. The essential Tyr residue that is nucleotidylated by the viral polymerase to form primers for RNA synthesis is located on the first \u03b1-helix and exposed to the solvent. When the MNV VPg was docked manually into the crystal structure of the MNV NS7 RdRp the Tyr residue could not be placed in sufficient proximity to the active site to allow for a nucleotidylation reaction. However when the first \u03b1-helix is detached from the VPg core, or when the thumb and fingers domains of the polymerase are moved apart then a productive complex could be formed. No inhibitors of VPg functions are known, but its multiple protein-protein interactions may provide suitable targets for antivirals. It would be important to solve the structure of the NS7-VPg complex and to explore whether this interaction can be annihilated by specific inhibitors. Recently a picornavirus VPg-uridylylation AlphaScreen has been developed for high-throughput screening [78]. A similar approach can be envisioned to find inhibitors of the norovirus VPg-guanylation reaction.",

The structures obtained show that the protease induces an extended \u03b2-strand conformation in the substrate. In addition they explain why the cleavage specificity-determining interactions are conserved across viral serine-like proteases. Comparative analysis of the structures of caliciviruses, picornaviruses and coronavirus proteases reveal that the Glu or Gln in the P1 position make identical sets of interactions involving highly conserved His, Thr, and Tyr residues in the S1 pocket. The S2 pocket show great flexibility in association with substrate binding and these changes are correlated with alterations in the S4 pocket. The inhibitors tested were all irreversible inhibitors that covalently link to the active site cysteine residue (Fig. 1). Different reactive groups, such as bisulfite, esters, aldehyde, ketoamides and ketones have been used [81], [82], [83].

This explains why the nucleosides tested [5-fluorouracil (5FU), 2-thiouridine (2TU) and ribavirin] bind with some flexibility and/or slightly shifted from the expected conformation. The relevance of these approaches to find inhibitors can be questioned. For example while 2TU and ribavirin show a similar binding mode in these crystal structures they differ significantly in their potency to block MNV replication in vitro\n[85].",

In one study the binding mode of the natural substrate CTP and a potent competitive inhibitor 5-nitro-cytidine-5\u2032-triphosphate were determined [86]. The precise positioning of these nucleotides exerts significant effects on the efficiency of the nucleotidyl transfer reaction and suggests that a series of hydrogen-bonding and van der Waals interactions with the ribose moiety may play an important role in nucleotide recognition and positioning within the active site. In a second study the binding of 2\u2032-amino-2\u2032-deoxycytidine-5\u2032-triphosphate was investigated. The binding mode of this nucleotide in the active site forces the enzyme to remain in an open \u201cinactive\u201d conformation, which can be regarded as a novel mechanism of inhibition. These structural changes are attributable to the replacement of the 2\u2032-hydroxyl group with an amino group that rearranges the polymerase active site and disrupts the coordination shells of the active-site metal ions. Such replacement of the 2\u2032-hydroxyl group therefore suggests a general approach for the design of RdRp inhibitors [87].",

Interestingly this study started from the crystal structure of the human norovirus RdRp bound to an RNA primer\u2013template duplex and CTP and removed both the CTP and the short dsRNA [86]. Based on this structure the authors screened a small set of \u223c1200 molecules for their potential to bind to the active site in silico and the two most interesting compounds showed clear inhibition of human norovirus polymerase in vitro. Crystallization and X-ray diffraction experiments together with mutational analysis subsequently demonstrated that, in absence of any substrate, these molecules bind to the active site of MNV and human norovirus polymerase. In addition a follow-up study using reverse fragment screening unraveled a novel binding site for a third inhibitor in the RdRp thumb domain [89].",

While in the hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication cholesterol biosynthesis is upregulated and cholesterol-lowering statins act as antivirals through blockage of protein geranylgeranylation [92], the opposite was reported for norovirus. Statins such as simvastatin increased the replication of Norwalk virus which was correlated with an increased expression of low density lipoprotein receptor (LDLR). It was postulated that LDLR could play an important direct role in virus replication such as participating in viral replication complexes as an essential cofactor [61]. In addition, bile acids [for which cholesterol is a biosynthesis precursor] were found essential for the in vitro replication of the PEC/Cowden Sapovirus [93]. In gnotobiotic pigs, simvastatin increased the infectivity of human norovirus, which was linked to a suppressive effect on innate immune response via interferon-\u03b1 [62], [94]. The use of statins has indeed been regarded as a risk factor for severe norovirus gastroenteritis [95]. The activity of acyl-CoA:cholesterol acyltransferase (ACAT) is also an important factor for cholesterol biosynthesis and unlike statins, treatment with ACAT inhibitors resulted in reduced levels of Norwalk replication [and of LDLR]. This indicates that ACAT could be a target for inhibition of norovirus replication [61].",
