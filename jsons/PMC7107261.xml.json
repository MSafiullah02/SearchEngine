It appears that the disclaimer made for financial investments applies equally well to emerging infections\u2014past experience is no guarantee of future performance.",

He was admitted and discharged, then re-admitted at a second hospital where the diagnosis of MERS-CoV infection was confirmed on 20 May.6 In the week before diagnosis, this index case was not suspected to have MERS-CoV and, therefore, his caregivers did not use appropriate isolation precautions and personal protective equipment. As a result of this critical lapse, South Korea experienced a large outbreak and is now the country with the second largest number of MERS-CoV cases in the world, after Saudi Arabia. As of 23 July 2015, this outbreak stands at 186 cases, with 36 deaths and a case fatality rate of 19%;7 South Korea appears to be on track to declare the outbreak over by August 2015 after completing two incubation periods without new cases. Over 16 000 individuals had to be quarantined for potential exposure and over 30 healthcare facilities had to undergo investigations for possible MERS-CoV transmission.",

In Singapore, health advisories for travellers to and from Korea and border screening with thermal scanners were implemented, along with the usual circulars to all healthcare facilities and doctors to increase vigilance for travel-related importations. Tan Tock Seng Hospital and the Communicable Disease Centre are the designated facilities in Singapore for outbreak management, including Ebola, MERS-CoV and avian influenza. Over the past 3 years, our hospital has evaluated over 300 patients who either walked in themselves or were referred by a doctor for possible MERS-CoV infection. Our Emergency Department doctors balance the risk of missing a case with the challenges of admitting reluctant patients to isolation rooms (which are a finite resource). For front-line clinicians without the luxury of hindsight, knowledge of the case definitions (pneumonia plus travel exposure) is balanced by awareness that the spectrum of disease includes mild infection, clinical presentations may evolve and upper respiratory samples may not detect infection, especially early in the course of illness.10",
