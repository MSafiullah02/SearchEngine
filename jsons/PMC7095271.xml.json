As with the evolution of liver transplantation, increased experience, improved surgical techniques, and advances in postoperative care and immunosuppressive therapy have moved ITx into the medical mainstream. In selected experienced centers, ITx is now remarkably successful with up to 90% 3-year patient survival and 95% freedom from parenteral nutrition after isolated ITx [1, 2]. These results have led to increasing application of ITx as the treatment for intestinal failure (IF) when parenteral nutrition fails. Currently, approximately 175 ITx\u2019s are performed annually in the United States, with annual increases in volume [3]. The Pediatric Intensivist is a primary member of the transplant team and is involved in the evaluation and management of these patients from the time of referral for ITx [4].",

Threatened progression of early and/or mild parenteral nutrition-associated liver disease in patients with IF usually indicates transplantation of the intestine alone. The expectation is that postoperative withdrawal of parenteral feeding will arrest the progression of liver disease [12]. When severe fibrosis or cirrhosis accompanies IF, particularly with signs of portal hypertension, transplantation of both intestine and liver are required. Motility disorders may involve severe impairment of gastric emptying and may mandate multivisceral transplantation (to include the stomach). The consensus of the transplant community is that loss of half of the usual access sites, the internal jugular and subclavian veins, is sufficient to warrant referral [13]. These patients may require several months of TPN after surgery, and the complexity of post transplant care demands adequate central venous access. Late referrals with poor i.v. access may render the patients ineligible for transplantation. Contraindications to surgery are listed in Table 1.\n",

Post-operative ileus generally persists for several days, during which proximal graft decompression is essential to avoid distention that increases resistance to mural blood flow and the risk of graft ischemia. After this time, detection of bowel sounds, stoma drainage, and tolerance of gastric tube occlusion indicate that enteral feeding can begin. When graft size does not match the size of the abdominal cavity, compartment syndrome may develop, jeopardizing perfusion to the fresh graft and the kidneys as well as restricting diaphragmatic mobility. When suspected, monitoring of intraabdominal pressure [23] may be helpful in assessing the need for surgical intervention.

Hemoglobin oxygen saturation >95% and hematocrit between 27 and 30% provide the optimal balance between oxygen carrying capacity and viscosity that, when high, reduces cardiac output and microcirculation.

In light of protein loss from peritoneal fluid, albumin is usually given. Ideally, maintaining adequate hematocrit, oxygenation and preload will lead to adequate tissue perfusion.

After transplant, generous fluid administration required to maintain graft capillary blood flow risks pulmonary edema, leading to intrapulmonary shunts, especially with pre-existing lung disease. Decreased chest wall and abdominal wall compliance secondary to edema, large graft size, ascites, and pleural effusions may further compromise pulmonary function. High inspired oxygen concentrations and distending airway pressures needed to maintain desired hemoglobin oxygen saturation greater than 95% may lead to further pulmonary injury. In patients with severe lung disease, permissive hypercarbia may minimize such injury, with target tidal volumes of 6\u20138 cc/kg body weight and plateau pressures <30 cm H2O, as per the ARDSnet protocol [24]. High frequency oscillatory ventilation is sometimes required to achieve adequate oxygenation while maintaining low intra-alveolar pressures. Patients with a multivisceral transplant are at an increased risk for transient diaphragmatic dysfunction that can be assessed with ultrasonography or fluoroscopy. This may prolong the mechanical ventilatory course but is almost always reversible with conservative management. The trachea of most patients with isolated small intestinal transplants can be extubated within the first 24\u201348 h after surgery. Patients with multivisceral transplants usually remain intubated for several days, particularly when large graft size mandates delayed abdominal closure (Table 3), however, the priority must be early extubation to reduce the risk of ventilator-associated pneumonia.

Some transplant centers use of low-dose dopamine 2.5\u20135.0 \u00b5g/kg/min or fenoldopam 0.03\u20130.1 \u00b5g/kg/min to improve renal blood flow, although proof of efficacy is lacking. When extra-corporeal renal support is needed, we prefer continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration (CVVHD) to avoid rapid volume shifts that may adversely affect organ perfusion. Oliguria and resistance to diuretic therapy may result in excessive fluid retention following initial post-transplant resuscitation, leading to prolonged ventilation and to potential delays in abdominal closure in patients with a prosthetic mesh covering the abdominal wound.",

Metabolic acidosis, hypokalemia, hypocalcemia, hypophosphatemia, and hypomagnesemia are common post-operatively, and may reappear following initiation of enteral nutrition because of increased fecal losses that require continued intravenous and later enteral replacement. Postoperative hyperglycemia is also common, irrespective of whether all or part of the pancreas is included in the composite graft, and close blood glucose monitoring is required. The value of tight glycemic control with continuous intravenous insulin infusions [25] has been recently challenged [26]. A multicenter pediatric study is underway in North America. Insulin therapy is sometimes required following multivisceral transplantation, as the native pancreas is removed and insulin secretion by the pancreas graft may be delayed.",

Later, invasive fungal infection becomes common, particularly in those with motility disorders and with pre-transplant diabetes mellitus, corticosteroid therapy and renal insufficiency. After transplant, hyperglycemia, poor graft function, and renal failure continue to promote infection, as does intensification of immunosuppression necessitated by rejection [16, 17]. After the first post-transplant month, the cumulative effect of intense immunosuppressive therapy renders patients susceptible to numerous additional opportunistic viral, and protozoan pathogens, such as cytomegalovirus, Epstein\u2013Barr virus, and rarely Pneumocystis carinii [28, 29]. Strict adherence to aseptic technique during invasive procedures, dressing changes, and hand washing before and after each patient contact are essential, as is adherence to the Guidelines for the Prevention of Intravascular Catheter-Related Infections issued by the Center for Disease Control [30].",

New feeding intolerance with emesis and increased stomal output suggest early rejection; onset of cramping suggests progressive disease. Blood in stomal effluent or friable or bleeding stoma imply a late diagnosis of advanced rejection. Fluid losses may be high enough to require replacement to avoid severe dehydration. Less commonly, stomal output may be reduced rather than increased with feeding intolerance, indicating radiological evaluation for mechanical obstruction and, potentially, operative intervention. Perforation, either of the graft or remnant small bowel, is unusual but may occur within the setting of early ischemia-reperfusion injury and protracted, severe rejection.

            "text": "A recent European report of 10 years of pediatric intestinal transplantation [2] shows a 3-year survival rate of 71.5%. Twenty-nine percent of the patients died within 4 months of grafting, mostly from infectious complications [46]. Table 3 shows recent results for 38 pediatric intestinal transplants from our center from the last 4 years. The International Intestinal Transplant Registry updates survival data every few years, but single center experience often achieve higher survival rates. In our experience, one year survival of 85% has been achieved for all recipients of intestinal transplants. As outcomes of ITx improve, transplant teams accept patients with higher pre-operative morbidity and organ dysfunction and at higher risk for complications. Early referrals for transplant evaluation before severe liver disease, recurrent central venous catheter-related sepsis and venous thromboses develop will increase the likelihood of survival to transplant and will reduce the risk of post operative morbidity.",
