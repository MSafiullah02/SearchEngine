            "text": "Coronaviruses (CoVs) are enveloped, positive-stranded RNA viruses that cause respiratory and/or enteric disease in mammals and birds (Enjuanes et al., 2000). With the largest known genomic RNA, CoVs are prone to dramatic shifts of the tissue tropism or host range through accumulation of point mutations or deletions/insertions or recombination events affecting the structural and non-structural proteins (Decaro and Buonavoglia, 2008). Currently, CoVs are classified into three different genetic and antigenic groups with group 2 being further divided into subgroups 2a and 2b. Subgroup 2a consists of mouse hepatitis virus, rat sialodacryadenitis virus, human coronavirus (HCoV) HKU1 (Woo et al., 2005) and several bovine-like CoVs, including bovine coronavirus (BCoV), porcine haemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (PHEV), HCoV-OC43, human enteric coronavirus (HECoV) 4408 (Enjuanes et al., 2000), and the newly recognized equine coronavirus (ECoV) (Guy et al., 2000) and canine respiratory coronavirus (CRCoV) (Erles et al., 2003, Decaro et al., 2007). There are multiple genetic and antigenic evidences that several subgroup 2a CoVs, such as HCoV-OC43, HECoV-4408, PHEV and CRCoV, have arisen as consequence of trans-species infections caused by BCoV (Zhang et al., 1994, Vijgen et al., 2005, Vijgen et al., 2006, Erles et al., 2007, Lorusso et al., 2009). According to the proposal of the Coronavirus Study Group of the International Committee of Taxonomy of Viruses, given their close genetic relatedness, all BCoV-like CoVs are now considered not as separate viruses but rather as host range variants of the same species Betacoronavirus 1 within genus Betacoronavirus (formerly group 2) (de Groot et al., 2008).",

The thermal profile consisted of activation of iTaq DNA polymerase at 95\u00b0 C for 10 min, followed by 45 cycles of denaturation at 95\u00b0 C for 15 s and annealing-extension at 60\u00b0 C for 1 min. BCoV-like RNA copy numbers were calculated on the basis of the standard curves generated by 10-fold dilutions of a synthetic RNA obtained by in vitro transcription of a plasmid containing the M gene of BCoV strain 339/06 (Decaro et al., 2008c).",

The bubaline virus (BuCoV-179/07-11) was found to be strictly related to BCoV at the genetic level, but displayed some unique biological properties such as poor growth on MDBK cells and lack of HA activity using chicken erythrocytes (Decaro et al., 2008d). In this paper, we have reported the genetic characterisation of four additional BuCoV strains detected in buffalos with gastroenteritis. While three strains were strictly related to each other and to the prototype BuCoV isolate, strain 339/07-C was more similar to BCoVs by both sequence analysis and phylogeny of the 5\u2032 end of the S gene. These findings seem to suggest a distinct origin of the two clusters of BuCoVs from BCoV. However, as other genomic regions were not analysed in this study, a potential origin of strain 339/07-C as recombinant virus between BuCoV and BCoV cannot be ruled out definitively.",

These findings are in agreement with those already obtained with the prototype strain 179/07-11 (Decaro et al., 2008d), the giraffe isolate GiCoV-OH3 and recent BCoVs (Hasoksuz et al., 2007). In the HA test with mouse erythrocytes, the results for the GiCoV-OH3 strain were similar to those for BCoV strains at both 4 \u00b0C and 37 \u00b0C, whereas the ability to agglutinate chicken erythrocytes by GiCoV-OH3 was observed only at 4 \u00b0C. Similar results were also obtained for one enteric BCoV (BCoV-TS) and two respiratory BCoVs (67NS and 220NS) (Hasoksuz et al., 2007). The absent or poorly efficient adaptation to MDBK cells and the lack of HA activity with chicken red blood cells could be considered typical features of BuCoV. In fact, although other ruminant CoVs and even some BCoV strains displayed similar characteristics, those were never combined (Benfield and Saif, 1990, Hasoksuz et al., 2007). Two recent BCoV isolates from southern Italy (the enteric strain 339/06 and the respiratory strain 438/06-2) exhibited HA and growth patterns very different from those of BuCoV isolates. However, more studies of contemporary BCoV isolates in the same geographic area should be done to decide if these attributes apply only to BuCoV or if such differences are consistent among CoVs from different ruminant species.",

Among the emergent pathologies, viral gastroenteritis, mainly associated with coronavirus (Muniiappa et al., 1985, Decaro et al., 2008d) and rotavirus (Sunil-Chandra and Mahalingam, 1994, Martella et al., 2003) infections, is playing an increasing role in the economical losses related to the calf mortality, especially when female calves are affected. The changes in the hygienic conditions highlight the need for a more in-depth investigation of these viral infections that are frequently associated to different clinical pictures in comparison with cattle. For instance, coronavirus infections can cause enteric as well as respiratory disease in cattle (Lathrop et al., 2000, Storz et al., 2000, Decaro et al., 2008a), whereas respiratory distress has not been associated with BuCoV so far. In addition, the impact of these emerging infections in water buffalo herds should be evaluated as for the extensive use of vaccines.",
