HEK293-P2X7R cells, stably transfected cell line with P2X7R, were used as a positive control. P2X7R expression was observed in E10, an AEC I cell line and MLE15, a lung epithelial cell line. However, HEK293 (a human epithelial kidney cell line), R3/1 (a rat AEC I cell line), A549 (a human carcinoma AEC II cell line), Pre-TII (a rat fetal AEC II cell line), H441 (a human lung papillary adenocarcinoma epithelial cell line), RLE-6TN (a rat lung AEC II cell line), and RFL-6 (a fetal lung fibroblast cell line) had no P2X7R expression (Supplementary Figure S1a in the online data supplement). The mRNA expression of mouse P2X subunits was further analyzed using PCR. P2X3R, P2X4R, P2X6R, and P2X7R subunits were highly expressed in E10 cells. The expression levels of P2X1R and P2X5R subunits were barely detectable, and P2X2R had no expression in E10 cells. All of the P2X subunits were expressed in the lung tissue (Supplementary Figure S1b).",

Treatment of E10 cells with 2\u2032-3\u2032-O-(4-benzoylbenzoyl)-ATP (BzATP), a potent P2X7R agonist, for 12 h significantly decreased cell viability in a dose-dependent manner as measured with MTT assay and counting cell numbers (Figure 1a and Supplementary Figure S2a). Direct cell lysis was monitored by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release. High doses (>200 \u03bcM) of BzATP dramatically increased LDH release from dead cells (Figure 1b). To determine the specificity of BzATP, oxidized ATP (oATP, a P2X7R antagonist) was utilized to block P2X7R activity. Pre-incubation of E10 cells with 500 \u03bcM oATP totally attenuated the BzATP effect on cell viability (Figure 1c) and LDH release (Supplementary Figure S2b). We have previously shown that adenovirus-based shRNAs significantly reduce P2XR protein levels in E10 cells.17The knockdown of P2X7R under the same conditions also inhibited the BzATP-induced reduction in cell viability (Figure 1d) and increase in LDH release (Supplementary Figure S3a). In addition, BzATP did not induce cell death in the lung cells, A549 and H441, that do not express P2X7R (Supplementary Figure S3c and d). To determine whether BzATP-mediated cell death is reversible, E10 cells were treated with BzATP for various times and were allowed to recover in a normal medium without BzATP for 8 h. The cells treated for up to 6 h were reversible. However, if the cells were treated for longer than 8 h, the cells cannot be recovered (Figure 1e).",

Several components of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling were analyzed after BzATP treatment. Western blot analysis demonstrated that activated \u03b2-catenin and, to a lesser extent, total \u03b2-catenin were downregulated by BzATP treatment (Figure 2a). Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2), classic cell survival proteins were reduced as well (Figure 2a). To further determine the effect of BzATP on \u03b2-catenin/TCF/LEF activity, dual-luciferase assay was used to determine the activities of TOPflash, a TCF/LEF reporter plasmid expressing firefly luciferase. BzATP significantly decreased TOPflash activity. However, BzATP had no effect on the activity of FOPflash, a plasmid containing a mutated TCF/LEF-binding site (Figure 2b). Furthermore, we examined the mRNA expression of several Wnt/\u03b2-catenin downstream genes: Bmp4, Axin2, Cyclin D1, and Cyclin E1. Real-time PCR showed that the expression of all these four target genes was inhibited (Figure 2c and Supplementary Figure S4). Our results indicate that Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling is suppressed by BzATP treatment.",

            "text": "To evaluate the role of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling in P2X7R-mediated cell death, we activated Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling with its natural ligand, Wnt3a, and examined its effect on P2X7R-mediated depression of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling and cell death. Wnt3a_CM and Wnt5a_CM were obtained from L-cells that stably expressed Wnt3a or Wnt5a. The medium from L-cells (Con_CM) was used as a control. The pre-treatment of E10 cells with Wnt3a_CM prevented BzATP-mediated downregulation of total \u03b2-catenin and activated \u03b2-catenin (Figure 2a), inhibition of TOPflash activity (Figure 2b) and decrease in Axin2 (Figure 2c). As shown above, BzATP treatment caused a decrease in cell number of E10 cells. Wnt3a_CM, but not Wnt5a_CM or Con_CM, prevented the BzATP-induced decrease in cell number (Figure 3a). Immunostaining confirmed the activation of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin in E10 cells by Wnt3a as evidenced by nuclear translocation of \u03b2-catenin (Figure 3a). Activation of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling by Wnt3a_CM in E10 cells also blocked P2X7-mediated decrease in cell viability and increase in LDH release (Figures 3b and c). Wnt3a_CM also protected primary AEC-I-like cells from BzATP-induced cell death (Figure 3d). YO-PRO dye uptake triggered by BzATP was not inhibited by Wnt3a_CM (Supplementary Figure S5), indicating that P2X7R activity itself is not affected by the activation of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling.",

The result indicates that BzATP stimulates GSK-3\u03b2 activity. As expected, LiCl, a selective inhibitor of GSK-3\u03b2, activated Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling as indicated by the translocation of \u03b2-catenin into the nucleus (Supplementary Figure S6) and reduced BzATP-mediated cell death (Figures 4b and c).",

            "text": "To further investigate the role of P2X7R in AEC I death, BzATP was intratracheally instilled into the lung of rats. Histological examination of lung tissues showed evidence of diffused lung injury with significant alveolar septal necrosis and edema formation seen in BzATP-treated mice (Figure 6A). Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cell analysis indicated that activation of P2X7R led to a 3.2-fold increase in alveolar macrophages. However, no significant neutrophil infiltrations were observed (Figure 6B). BAL protein level was elevated by BzATP (Supplementary Figure S7). LDH activity in BAL, representing necrotic cell death, was also increased by BzATP treatment (Figure 6C). An increase in T1\u03b1, an AEC I marker, was observed in BAL of the BzATP-treated group, indicating AEC I damage (Figure 6D). Instillation of Wnt3a_CM together with BzATP dramatically reduced the number of alveolar macrophages in BAL and BAL protein concentration in comparison with Con_CM (Figure 6B and Supplementary Figure S7). Wnt3a also significantly decreased LDH and T1\u03b1 release caused by BzATP (Figures 6C and D). It was noted that both protein concentration and LDH activity in BAL were higher in Con_CM than in the PBS group. This is likely because of the existence of proteins and LDH in the conditioned medium (CM). These results indicated that Wnt3a can limit AEC I death induced by activation of P2X7R in rats.",
