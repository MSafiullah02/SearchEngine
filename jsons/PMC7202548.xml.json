All adult patients with a hematologic malignancy (including HSCT recipients) who had signs and symptoms of a URTI or LRTI in the inpatient and outpatient settings underwent a detailed clinical evaluation, and samples from the upper and/or lower respiratory tracts were screened for the presence of respiratory viruses. Patients with symptoms of URTI underwent nasopharyngeal aspiration, whereas patients with LRTI (i.e., pneumonia) underwent bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), when clinically possible. Patients with pneumonia but no signs of URTI did not undergo nasopharyngeal aspiration. Patients (both outpatients and inpatients) whose nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPAs) specimens tested positive for respiratory viruses were asked to return to the clinic (or undergo an inpatient sampling) at least weekly for further clinical assessment and microbiological analysis until all symptoms resolved and the virus was not detected in a NPA.",

The presence of viral antigen in respiratory cells was indicated by the appearance of characteristic intracellular apple-green fluorescence in \u2a7e1 cell. We used labeled antibodies to influenza A and B viruses; parainfluenza viruses 1, 2, and 3; RSV; and adenoviruses. If the samples did not contain respiratory epithelial cells, the finding was considered to be inconclusive. For viral culture, specimens were inoculated into each of 4 cell lines: human fibroblasts (MRC5), human epithelial cells (Hep-2 and A-549), and Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. Cultures were incubated for 2 weeks (4 weeks for detection of cytomegalovirus) on a roller drum at 35\u00b0C. Viruses were identified on the basis of cytopathic effect in cell cultures and confirmed by staining with fluorescein-conjugated monoclonal antibodies [10]. BAL samples were also processed for routine aerobic, anaerobic, mycobacterial, and fungal culture and for parasite examination.",

A first episode of infection was defined as the period during which the patient had symptoms of URTI and/or LRTI, regardless of whether a respiratory virus was isolated. A further episode(s) of infection required the presence of a symptom-free period and negative results of testing of the NPA for any respiratory viruses isolated during the previous episode. A polymicrobial infection was defined as the isolation of >1 respiratory virus during the same episode or another clinically relevant pathogen from a BAL fluid specimen or a lung sample. A diagnosis of nosocomial respiratory virus infection was considered if a patient had been in the hospital for \u2a7e3 days and if symptoms of the infection developed during hospitalization. A URTI was defined by the new onset of nasal, pharyngeal, or laryngeal irritation, and an LRTI (or pneumonia) was defined by the development of a new pulmonary infiltrate in patients with signs and symptoms of LRTI (cough, rales, wheezing). Death due to pneumonia was defined as death due to respiratory failure during the episode of respiratory virus infection. Progression of a URTI to an LRTI was defined as onset of pneumonia in patients with a prior or concurrent URTI, whereas patients who had pneumonia without a URTI were considered to have an isolated LRTI.",

The most frequently identified virus was influenza A virus, which was found in 51 cases. The isolation of this virus was strongly associated with its epidemic presence in the community. As seen in figure 1, 29 (52%) of 56 cases of influenza A virus infection occurred during January and February 2000, in conjunction with a large epidemic of infection in the community. The detailed clinical characteristics of the 75 episodes for which a respiratory virus was isolated from the initial sample are shown in table 3. The only apparent difference between these virus groups was the probability of dying of pneumonia, which was 10% among persons with influenza A virus infection, 20% among those with parainfluenza virus 1 or 3 infection, and 0% among those infected with other viruses.",

A large epidemic of influenza A virus infection occurred during our study period, and the isolates recovered from patients closely reflected the respiratory viruses isolated in the community, as shown in figure 1. The 7 enteroviruses found in our study confirm that these viruses also cause LRTI and URTI in these immunocompromised hosts [7, 11, 12].

Many of these cases may be of noninfectious origin or nonviral origin, or they may have been caused by other undetected viral pathogens, whereas other cases may represent technical flaws in sample processing or lack of sensitivity to detect involved respiratory viruses. In a recent study, PCR-based techniques were found to increase the rate of respiratory virus identification in a similar patient population to 35% (compared with 19% for culture) [12]. Thus, had we used such an approach, we might have found even more cases of respiratory virus infections. With respect to the clinical applicability of the microbiological methods used in our study for clinical decision making, findings for the direct immunofluorescence technique were available within 6\u201312 h after the sample arrived in the laboratory, but viral cultures usually took 7\u201310 days for results.",

Of the specific respiratory viruses found, influenza A virus did not carry a higher risk of progression of infection to LRTI (23%) on univariate and multivariate analyses. RSV infection, however, appeared to have a higher risk of LRTI (46% among RSV-positive patients and 15% among the rest; P =.01). This finding is not surprising, because both RSV and parainfluenza virus have been found to lead to LRTI in 30%\u201360% of immunosuppressed HSCT recipients with URTI [34\u20135, 1314\u201315]. Parainfluenza viruses 1 and 3 have also been described as carrying a high risk of producing severe LRTI [2], but we had too few cases of infections with these viruses for meaningful analysis. Of note, all 4 patients with parainfluenza virus 3 infection developed pneumonia, whereas none of those infected with parainfluenza virus 1 had an LRTI.",

This finding, however, requires confirmation in other series of patients. Allogeneic HSCT recipients are usually found to be at the highest risk for developing severe respiratory virus infections [123456\u20137]. However, in our study, which included 97 HSCT recipients (52 of whom received allogeneic transplants), we did not find that receipt of an allogeneic HSCT was a risk factor for progression to pneumonia (20% vs. 17% for progression to LRTI).",

Therefore, we suggest that screening for these viruses should be incorporated into the routine diagnostic study of patients with hematologic malignancies, both for epidemiological reasons (i.e., strict isolation of hospitalized patients with a respiratory virus infection) and for the use of currently available or emergent treatments in the most debilitated hosts.",
