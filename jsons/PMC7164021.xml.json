            "text": "The initial clues that molecular mimicry might play a role in autoimmune diseases were found in the early 1980s associated with the development and use of monoclonal antibody technology. It was first noted while generating monoclonal antibodies that the phosphoprotein of measles virus and a protein of herpes simplex virus type 1 cross\u2010reacted with an intermediate filament protein of human cells (29; Fig.\n\n2\n). The intermediate filament protein was identified as vimentin, and the monoclonal antibody against measles virus phosphoprotein was shown to react with an antigenic determinant on the intermediate filament molecule different from the reaction caused by antibody to herpes simplex virus protein. A number of similar cross\u2010reactivities between viral proteins and host \u2018self\u2019 determinants were subsequently recorded. The observations were firmly established as a result of a collaborative studywith the laboratories of Abner Notkins, Hilary Koprowski, and our own that documented roughly 5% of monoclonal antibodies made against 15 different kinds of viruses cross\u2010reacted with \u2018host\u2013self determinants\u2019 when over 800 independent monoclonal antibodies were studied (30, 31; Fig.\n\n3\n). In these experiments, monoclonal antibodies made against representative DNA and RNA viruses such as herpes simplex, cytomegalo, Epstein\u2010Barr, vaccinia virus, myxoviruses, paramyxoviruses, arenaviruses, flaviviruses, orthoviruses, rhabdoviruses, coronaviruses, and human retroviruses were studied. On the basis of needing five to six amino acids to induce a monoclonal antibody response, the probability of 20 amino acids occurring in six identical residues between two proteins is 206 or 1 in 128,000,000. Others showed that T lymphocytes obtained from the spinal fluids of patients with viral infections or with MS cross\u2010reacted with a specific viral determinant as well as a specific host myelin protein.",

            "text": "Biologic evidence was obtained over the next few years in several animal models indicating that molecular mimicry was more than an epiphenomenon (reviewed in ref 9). An early observation used myelin basic protein and allergic encephalomyelitis. The myelin basic protein sequences that cause allergic encephalitis are known and the encephalitogenic site of 8\u201310 amino acids has been mapped for several different animal species. With the use of computer\u2010assisted analysis (32), several viral proteins were uncovered that showed significant homology with the encephalitogenic site of myelin basic protein, including fits between the myelin basic protein and nucleoprotein of the hemagglutinin of influenza virus, core protein of adenovirus, EC\u2010LF2 protein of Epstein\u2010Barr virus, and hepatitis B virus polymerase as well as others. However, the best fit occurred between the myelin basic protein encephalitogenic site in the rabbit and hepatitis B virus polymerase (HBVP). It was then shown that inoculation of HBVP peptide peripherally into rabbits caused perivascular infiltration localized to the central nervous system, reminiscent of disease induced by inoculation of whole myelin basic protein or the peptide component of the encephalitogenic site of myelin basic protein (34; Fig.\n\n4\n). Further, a specific immune response to both cellular and humoral to myelin basic protein occurred. Thereafter, several other animal models were developed showing cross\u2010reactivity between a microbe and self antigen leading to disease. For example, coxsackie B3 virus shared sequence homology with heart myosin or other myocardial proteins (i.e., GAP junction), and experimental manipulations in experimental animals led to myocardial necrosis and myocarditis (35\u201337). Another early example of sequence homologies, immune cross\u2010reactivity, and disease in animals was autoimmune uveitis with cross\u2010reactivity between S\u2010antigen and viral peptides (38).",

Clinical studies have shown a high correlation with immune response to glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) and patients progressing to or having IDDM. Epidemiologic evidence has correlated IDDM with several viral infections, including coxsackie B virus, which has been shown, albeit rarely, by Koch's postulates to be associated with cases of acute IDDM (13, 14, 16). A component of GAD amino acids 247\u2013279 was shown to be recognized by patients with increased risk of IDDM and to share sequence similarity with the P2\u2010C protein of coxsackie B virus. Evaluation of patients with IDDM, of high risk to develop IDDM, or healthy controls showed that peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 4 of 16 newly diagnosed IDDM patients (25%) or 7 of 15 patients (47%) with high risk of developing IDDM (having islet cell autoantibodies with IDDM) proliferated to both GAD and coxsackie B viral peptides; however, none of the 13 healthy controls did (40, 41), suggesting apossible association for a virus like coxsackie B with IDDM.",

            "text": "One of the interesting and still controversial findings for an association of microbes with disease by the mechanism of molecular mimicry occurs with AS and bacterial infections (42\u201346). Epidemiologic, bacteriologic, and immunologic evidence is firm for a correlation between AS, the hypervariable region of HLA B27, and several bacterial infections including those of S. flexneri, Yersinia entercolytica, and K pneumoniae. Over 90% of individuals developing AS have the HLA B27 haplotype. In a S. flexneri epidemic of about 150,000 cases in Finland in the 1940s, 344 infected individuals developed Reiter's syndrome; of these, 82 went on to develop AS. Amino acid sequence homology between enteric bacteria associated with Reiter's syndrome and thus AS with the hypervariable region of HLA B27 was observed (Fig.\n\n5\n). When transgenic mice were created to express human HLA B27 and challenged with cross\u2010reactive peptides derived from proteins of such bacteria, immune responses occurred with inflammatory cells localized to joints and vertebral columns in approximately 40% of inoculated mice (M. B. A. Oldstone, S. Shyp, P. Peterson, and D. LaFace, unpublished observations; Fig. 5). Patients with AS showed antibodies in their circulation that cross\u2010reacted with both the hypervariable region of HLA\u2010B27 as well as a closely homologous sequence from K pneumoniae nitrogenase (43, 44). Subsequently, a transgenic rat model was developed in which expression of HLA\u2010B27 was associated with a clinical and histopathologic picture reminiscent of AS (45). AS\u2010like disease occurred in rats in a normal vivarium and did not occur in rats housed in germ\u2010free conditions (23). When germ\u2010free rats were colonized with bacteria, they developed arthritis (46). Besides molecular mimicry, other investigators (23, 46) raised the possibility that HLA B27 may be associated with delayed or disordered clearance of the associated bacterial pathogens.",

            "text": "To apply a greater degree of specificity and a more stringent approach to the study of molecular mimicry and potential associated diseases (32), Wucherpfennig and Strominger (47) as well as Hammer et al. (48) imposed a structural requirement for molecular mimicry searches. Wucherpfennig and Strominger used the known structure for MHC class II disease\u2010associated molecules with peptide binding and TCR for a known immunodominant myelin basic protein peptide. By database search, a panel of 129 peptides from microbes were obtained that matched the molecular mimicry motif, and these were tested on several T cell clones obtained from the cerebral spinal fluid of multiple sclerosis patients (47). Eight peptides (seven of viral and one of bacterial origin) were found to efficiently activate three of these clones, whereas only one of the eight peptides would have been identified as an appropriate molecular mimic by sequence alignment. These observations indicated that a single T cell receptor could recognize several distinct but structurally related peptides from multiple pathogens, suggesting more permissivity for TCR than previously appreciated, an observation supported by other recent reports (49\u201351). Hammer et al. (48) analyzed the possible peptide motifs that bound to HLA\u2010DR \u03b2 chain associated with autoimmune disease. The influence of single key residues was tested by using site\u2010directed mutations. A selection of peptides binding to rheumatoid arthritis\u2010linked DR allotypes was shown to be critical for position aa 71 of DR \u03b2 and 57 of DQ \u03b2 (48). Extension of these findings to IDDM (47, 48) suggested that IDDM \u2018autoimmune\u2019 peptide would bear a negative charge at P9 in order to bind preferentially to diabetes\u2010associated DQ allele. In toto, these findings should assist in identification of potential peptides (self? viral? microbe?) associated with the pathogenesis of autoimmune disease. One variation on this theme to help explain MHC linkage with autoimmune disease and infectious agents is that MHC\u2010derived self peptides prominent in selecting the T cell repertoire may be mutated and/or share immunologic cross\u2010reactive epitopes with microbial antigens. Others (51) have shown that a six amino acid peptide can sensitize myelin basic protein\u2010specific T cells to cause EAE and have used this information to identify viral and bacterial proteins (peptides) that share similar amino acids. Of interest will be experiments using such viral or microbial agents to initiate/potentiate or perhaps block the autoimmune EAE disease.",

            "text": "To dissect the pathogenetic mechanisms by which viral infection can break tolerance or unresponsiveness to self and the sequential events involved in the autoreactive cascade that leads to autoimmune disease, we and others have designed and exploited transgenic mouse models. An illustration of a model we developed for analysis of virus\u2010induced IDDM is shown in Fig.\n\n6\n, with the model described in refs 52 and 53. The cardinal observations uncovered through the analysis of this model are as follows. 1) Lymphocytes in the periphery are ignorant or unresponsive to the \u2018self\u2019 protein, but can be activated in the absence of viral infection by coexpressing cytokines like interferon\u2010\u03b3 or activation molecules such as B7.1 in the target (\u03b2 cells) area. 2) Infection by the same virus from which the \u2018self\u2019 protein was used as a transgene or a closely related virus that both cross\u2010reacts and induces sufficient effector cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) also causes the autoimmune disease. 3) If the transgene is expressed only in the target tissue, the autoimmune disease occurs rapidly, with kinetics of disease occurring by 10\u20134 days. Such positively selected high affinity effector T cells kill beta cells in the islets of Langerhans. The effector cell is a CD8 CTL and killing is dependent on perforin and interferon\u2010\u03b3. However, if the transgene is also expressed in the thymus, then the kinetics for initiation of disease after viral infection is prolonged. 4) Depending on the MHC haplotype, disease takes between 1 and 7 months to occur. 5) Whereas the rapidonset autoimmune disease uses high affinity effector CTL, in contrast to the slow\u2010onset autoimmune disease, the majority of high affinity T cells have been selected out in the thymus (negative selection) and only low affinity cells are available in the periphery to participate in causing the autoimmune disease. 6) For low affinity CD8+ T cells to produce disease, they require help from CD4, but such help is not necessary for the rapid\u2010onset disease. 7) Expression of Th.2 cytokine such as interleukin 4 (IL\u20104) retards the autoimmune diabetes. Table\n\n3\n tabulates these findings (details can be found in refs 52\u201360; M. G. von Herrath, B. Coon, H. Mazarguil, J. E. Gairin, and M. B. A. Oldstone, unpublished results).",

When the cytokine profile in the islets of Langerhans milieu was changed from a Th.1 to a Th.2 phenotype (\u03b3\u2010interferon to IL\u20104, TGF\u2010\u03b2), IDDM was blocked even though this therapy had no demonstrable effect on precursor frequency of the effector CD8+ CTL (58; R. Mueller\u2010Hoenger, M. G. von Herrath, X. Zhang, G. Patstone, T. Krahl, B. Coon, M. B. A. Oldstone, and N. Sarvetnick, unpublished results). A second successful therapeutic approach was to design a peptide that could bind at high affinity to the MHC allele involved in the IDDM (59; M. G. von Herrath, B. Coon, H. Mazarguil, J. E. Gairin, and M. B. A. Old\u2010stone, unpublished results). IDDM did not occur by this means; CD4+ and CD8+ T cells did not accumulate in the islets, but were found around them (peri\u2010islitis). Further, the precursor frequency of the effector CD8+ T cells was diminished by several\u2010fold, below a level required to cause IDDM. Another successful approach was to abort the expression of MHC class I molecule by coexpressing the E3 transcriptional complex of adenovirus in \u03b2 cells of the islets of Langerhans (60). The focal reduction of MHC class I expression in the islets was associated with a normal precursor frequency of CD8+ CTLs in the spleen and blood. However, effector T cells did not localize in the islets, destruction of islets did not occur, and IDDM did not develop.",

In a second scenario, the transgene is inserted and expressed in the thymus as well as the \u03b2 cells of the islets. Because the transgene (viral gene) is inserted in the germline of the host and passed to subsequent progeny, it is in essence a host \u2018self\u2019 gene. Using both models allows the study of the mechanisms and kinetics by which immunologic tolerance is broken, peripheral low affinity (transgene expressed in the thymus) or high affinity (transgene not expressed in the thymus) effector T cells are activated, home to the islets, and cause autoimmune disease. These models allow the design of therapeutic approaches to prevent or reverse the disease process at different steps along the way.",
