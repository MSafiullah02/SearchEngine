Moreover, in the clinical setting of community transmission, exposure or travel history alone would be not useful to identify the risk population of COVID-19 cases. Hence, laboratory-based diagnosis is critical. At the present time, RT-PCR assays were most widely used to detect SARS-CoV-2. Current data are insufficient to determine their sensitivity and specificity for SARS-CoV-2. A previous study demonstrated SARS virus could be detected in approximately one-third of patients during early phase of the illness, and most frequently during the second week of illness.8 We believe that the diagnostic performance of molecular testing improves during the decades. However, more data are needed to address the issue.",

After RNA extraction, the test result could be read using a dipstick in less than an hour.

In the cases of pneumonia, our diagnostic capacity could be hindered by the nature of isolation units. For example, for the first COVID-19 case in the United States, only point-of-care laboratory testing was permitted initially.9 The current rate of co-infection and distribution of coexisting organisms in the cases of COVID-19 remain undefined. Of note, current evidence suggests that co-infection is not uncommon in the patients with community-acquired pneumonia.11 In a prospective study of 2259 patients with pneumonia and specimens submitted for comprehensive bacterial and viral testing, etiologic agents were detected in only 38% cases. Among these cases, the percentages of co-infections were associated with the severity and geographic regions.11 Clinical guideline for the treatment of community-acquired pneumonia in Taiwan shall be considered for these cases.12\n",
