Before COVID\u201019, the majority of the APPE learning outcomes had been assessed during the daily face\u2010to\u2010face interaction between the faculty preceptor, other health care providers, patients, and the APPE students. However, during the COVID\u201019 pandemic, we have begun to brainstorm on how to ensure assessing these learning outcomes without having the APPE students on\u2010site. We have come to the conclusion that we have to strike a balance by using remote virtual platforms, in order to ensure that these learning outcomes are assessed. These platforms were used as communication and collaboration platforms that combined persistent workplace chatting, video meetings, and file sharing and storage. We also had to take into consideration the overwhelming tasks that we, as faculty preceptors, had to fulfill during the pandemic, such as live streaming, recording enormous amounts of lectures, and ensuring being at the bedside as much as possible (Table 2).",

            "text": "During each educational session, we started with national and international COVID\u201019 updates, focusing mainly on the pharmacotherapy aspects and the role of pharmacist during outbreaks. Then, the session was broken into three main themes. During the first theme, we ensured infusing activities to assess the knowledge skills domain for each APPE student, such as topic discussions. During the second theme, we introduced several activities to assess the cognitive skills domain, such as evaluating or designing therapeutic plans for real patient cases or made\u2010up cases. During the third theme, we performed several activities to assess the communication skills domain, such as debating with other APPE students on clinical topics with controversies. Nevertheless, we had some challenges in the assessment of the interprofessional skills domain, given the nature of the clinical practice, which requires on\u2010site interaction with other health care providers. In order to overcome this obstacle, students were requested to prepare a several presentations using videoconferencing for the nurses and other health care providers. Moreover, depending on the urgency, students were requested to provide evidence\u2010based formal answers for any drug\u2010related questions that came up during daily bedside rounds that had to be communicated verbally or in writing. Role\u2010playing was used to assess the communication domain, in which the students and the faculty preceptor took on different roles, such as acting to be the patient or other health care providers. Students were also requested to workup de\u2010identified real patients. Different modality was used than the one used in normal circumstances. On a daily basis, students were provided with de\u2010identified relevant patient information from their faculty preceptor that was extracted from the electronic medical record. Students were requested to address patients' problems and draft their assessment and plan, including any therapeutic drug monitoring interventions. For their therapeutic drug monitoring plans, students were requested to forward their final signed plan to their faculty preceptor through email after discussing their rationale with their faculty preceptors. Then, faculty preceptors would cosign and incorporate their plan in the electronic medical record. Moreover, there was an interactive videoconference session among all faculty preceptors and APPE students from the different rotations to share their insights and to summarize what they have learned at the end of each week. Table 1 highlights the major activities that were used successfully during the APPE restructuring process. Blackboard was used to submit all rotation\u2010related assignments. Students will be invited to complete an online survey at the end of the rotation to evaluate their experiences on their rotation structure and the learning outcomes before and after the rotation, and offer inputs on their experience and the ways to improve the future rotations. Figure 1 shows example screenshot from Cisco Webex videoconferencing application highlighting where the APPE students were involved in solving clinical questions in de\u2010identified or made\u2010up patient cases. As shown in the examples, APPE students were requested to ask pertinent questions to their faculty preceptor before conceptualizing their assessment and plan.",

For example, in the internal medicine rotation, APPE students were requested to involve in fall\u2010risk assessment task force meetings and to formulate total parenteral nutrition regimens for ongoing patients. In the critical care rotation, APPE students were asked to conduct an online simulation for acute cardiac life support and resuscitation strategies and create a \u201cdo not crush list\u201d and \u201cmedication precaution\u201d for potential medications that could be used for patients with COVID\u201019.

Still, we will continue to have to improvise. Following a thorough literature search, we came to conclude that the use of videoconferencing would be the best modality to deal with this issue without compromising our standards. Previous evidence showed that the use of videoconferencing could be a useful educational tool in clinical and biomedical sciences, especially in underserved areas.8, 9, 10, 11 Other evidence showed that the use of videoconferencing could be cost\u2010effective.\n12\n In pharmacy education, previous evidence showed that the use of videoconferencing in academia APPE elective was effective and successful.\n13\n As shown in our restructuring modality, there was a significant emphasis on the COVID\u201019 in each rotation to avoid detaching APPE students from reality and to highlight the integral role pharmacists can play during this outbreak. Moreover, the provided timeline for the restructured modality is more an estimate, and meeting sessions were adjusted according to the day\u2010to\u2010day COVID\u201019 situation. We urge other Pharmacy schools to adopt and customize their APPE rotations to ensure that the integrity of the learning outcomes is being delivered as per the requirements. We also urge the clinical pharmacy educational and professional bodies to release recommendations on the available modalities and best practices that could be used to ensure the delivery of the Pharmacy curriculum during this pandemic, which could then also be used in other urgent circumstances in the future. Countries that take into consideration the number of hours APPE students spend in each rotation should contact their Pharmacy Board for specific details.",

Our institution is able to provide free access to resources, such as Blackboard Collaborate Ultra and Webex, by the Cisco, Zoom, and Microsoft Teams. We have conducted all of our learning modalities smoothly, and there have been minimal technical issues. In our experience, we used Cisco Webex Meeting predominantly, as it was able to offer everything we were looking for, such as creating polls, breakout rooms, white boarding, and screen and file sharing. Blackboard was mainly used for assignments submission. We believe that the differences between these virtual platforms are minimal and they all serve the same purpose sufficiently. The advanced features that were made available by these platforms have maximized and enriched the learning experience of APPE students. Given the high demand for these resources during crisis times like this pandemic, internet connectivity and technical issues may limit the continuous daily use of these resources. Therefore, ensuring the availability of more than one resource to APPE students is crucial to maintaining an uninterrupted learning experience.",

            "text": "Our experience had certain limitations that are worth highlighting. First, despite the benefit of implementing a specialist model for a clinical pharmacy that allows more educational time at our institution, it was challenging to maintain optimal educational experience for our APPE students in addition to the academic, clinical, administration, and research duties during this outbreak. However, implementing more online videoconference discussions allowed for increased flexibility in the given timeframe. Second, our affiliated hospital, King Abdulaziz Medical City, is part of the National Guard Health Affairs system, which does not grant any remote access to electronic medical records for all health care providers. Although this could have a major effect on real\u2010case scenario exposure for students, maximizing the number of de\u2010identified or made\u2010up patient cases provided by the faculty and optimizing the use of online\u2010based simulated cases could maintain the learning experience. Moreover, the number of real patients cared for by the APPE students was lower than normal during COVID\u201019. Also, one major limitation of the current circumstance with COVID\u201019 is the limited face\u2010to\u2010face interaction with other health care providers, which hinders the interprofessional learning experience. That being said, this modality does not violate the ACPE standards as they suggest using multiple modalities including, face\u2010to\u2010face, tele\u2010health, or videoconferencing technology to conduct the interprofessional educational activities.\n7\n Our restructuring strategy may fill a temporary gap but is not a sustainable model. Using video\u2010communication interaction may offer a decent compromise that could be optimized via implementing strict strategies to ensure patient safety and privacy. Unfortunately, our pharmacy students did not have a chance to interact with other health care students, given the fact that other health care schools were using different modality than ours. However, integrating our experience with other health care students could improve the learning experience. Lastly, we have to acknowledge that we were not able to assess the APPE students' psychomotor skills due to the lack of face\u2010to\u2010face interaction between the APPE students and faculty preceptors.",
