Pharmacy professionals are considered essential partners in response to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Community and hospital pharmacies are expanding services and hours to provide essential services, putting pharmacists and their co-workers at the frontlines for patient care and safety to improve public health. In addition, pharmacy professionals are increasingly integrating into global, national, state and local EP&R efforts, including into interprofessional teams, such as Medical Reserve Corps (MRCs). However, lacunae exist for further integration of pharmacists into public health and safety initiatives. There are increasing opportunities and recommendations that should be expanded upon to provide improved patient care and population health intervention, and to ensure healthcare worker and public health safety.",

            "text": "In late December of 2019, reports of a new coronavirus infection in Wuhan, China were released. On March 11, 2020 the WHO declared the COVID-19 as a pandemic and asked for enhanced cooperation and collaboration among different nations. On January 21, 2020 the first confirmed case due to the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus was reported in the U.S. in the State of Washington; additional cases led to a national emergency declaration in the U.S. on March 13, 2020. Subsequently, unprecedented measures were taken in the U.S. and worldwide to address the pandemic, including closures of schools and non-essential businesses, restricted travel, social distancing, and other civil limitations and restrictions. 1, 2 Challenges in the COVID-19 response include healthcare workers with limited training in EP&R, lack of adequate supplies of PPEs (masks, hand sanitizers), testing kits, ventilators, number of available hospital beds, approved treatments, and a specific SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. These challenges affect pharmacists and pharmacy professionals who are among the frontline healthcare workers. 3 During the pandemic, pharmacy professionals have been highly responsive to the crisis. Community pharmacies and hospital pharmacies provide essential services to patients and healthcare teams through continued provision and supply of medicines and treatment. Pharmacies continue to stay open and, in some areas, provide extended hours and services. Pharmaceutical scientists and professionals are engaged in researching vaccines and treatments. Pharmacy professionals often serve as members of state or local Medical Reserve Corps (MRCs) and engage in ensuring continuity-of-care and supplies for communities, while others serve as volunteers and provide additional services to members of their communities.",

A joint statement was issued by ten (10) U.S. professional pharmacy organizations to support and enhance the roles of pharmacy professionals in the COVID-19 pandemic. 4 In yet another joint effort by thirteen pharmacy organizations, a petition addressing pharmacy reimbursements and rapid responses during crises was submitted to a bipartisan group of members of Congress. 5 However, the most recent Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, signed into legislation on March 27, 2020, did not grant provider status to pharmacists. It is noteworthy how the expansion of pharmacists' scope in the UK and Canada to include prescriptive privileges for certain medical conditions has the potential to contribute to COVID-2020 response capabilities, reduce costs, and relieve pressure on other providers such as general practice physicians. 6 This result is unfortunate, but illustrates that pharmacy organizations can work together on a shared vision.",

The American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy (AACP) Public Health Special Interest Group (SIG), established in the mid-2000s, has been active in supporting public health pharmacy within pharmacy education, research, practice and service, many of which have included EP&R topics. Several members of the AACP Public Health SIG created an ad-hoc committee to work for recognition of pharmacy within the 25Kmember American Public Health Association (APHA). APHA had previously recognized the role of the pharmacist in a 2006 policy statement, 13 but did not have a section or other networking group dedicated to pharmacy. In response to this situation, Dr. Stuart Feldman, a recognized leader in public health pharmacy, led a core group of public health pharmacy academics and leaders to petition the APHA for a special primary interest group (SPIG), which was approved by the APHA in November of 2014. In 2016, modifications to the APHA's policy statement were proposed, based on expanding roles of the pharmacist in public health. 14 In 2018, the APHA promoted the Pharmacy SPIG to become a Section, the first new Section in several years. Currently, the APHA Pharmacy Section has 275 members, including pharmacists from all practice settings such as academics, researchers, students, public health professionals, and others with interest in public health pharmacy. 15 In 2020, the APHA Pharmacy Section will issue a call for action to gain provider status and recognition of pharmacists as public health professionals. This move to include public health in major pharmacy organizations and pharmacy in a major public health organization demonstrates the interdisciplinary nature of public health pharmacy, which continues to show pharmacists' role and contribution to public health, especially during emergencies such as the COVID-19 pandemic.",

These drugs will be distributed from the SNS to states for providers to prescribe to adolescent and adult patients hospitalized with COVID-19, as appropriate, when a clinical trial is not available or feasible. The EUA requires that fact sheets that provide important information about using chloroquine phosphate and hydroxychloroquine sulfate in treating COVID-19 be made available to health care providers and patients, including the known risks and drug interactions. 24 To prevent misuse and hoarding, twenty two (22) states issued guidelines for pharmacists who are being allowed to \"use their professional judgment when filling prescriptions for chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine\" to ensure adequate supplies for patients with ongoing need for these medications for legitimate and/or pre-existing conditions such as lupus. 25 Guidance for remaining states are pending and pharmacy organizations and Boards of Pharmacy in these states should work to ensure that there are adequate measures taken to ensure medications for patients who currently need them.

To ensure the achievement of anticipated outcomes, it is important to improve processes such as facilitating continued screening, and/or testing and immunizing services, enabling medication dispensing, pick-up and delivery services, procuring essential medications and supplies, and notifying and addressing at-risk and disabled patients. Another element of the framework is the provision of quality patient education and guide access to evidence-based sources. In addition, it is important to address misinformation and unhelpful views during emergencies using communication and education approaches such as those described in the validated Health Belief Model (HBM). 11 In terms of population health intervention, the framework identifies the structure including state and local health departments and its integration and communication with pharmacists in a variety of practice settings for sharing of information and resources to enable outcomes such as updated software systems and integrated workflows and protocols. Another population-based intervention example is the existing structure such as State Poison Control Centers that should enhance answering services and poison prevention education (e.g. potentially inappropriate or overuse of hydroxychloroquine for self-treatment and without provider consultation for COVID-19 leading to potential toxicity). This will ensure the anticipated outcomes for patients and the public to receive accurate and high-quality information regarding medication use safety, as well as documentation of the number of calls and reports for toxicity.

            "text": "In recent decades, several public health crises have elevated the role of pharmacy professionals in EP&R. The HIV and Ebola virus outbreaks date from the 1980's and 1990's, but the recent focus on viral pneumonias date to the Asian highly pathogenic avian influenza A H5N1 virus (HPAI) (H5N1 Asian HPAI) outbreak in 1997, with cases reported in Hong Kong, China and elsewhere. 41 The H5N1 Asian HPAI re-focus news media attention on previous deadly pandemics, including the oft-forgotten 1918 H1N1 influenza pandemic. 42 Similarly, DeGuire et. al. 40 noted how the terrorist attacks on 11 September 2001 on the World Trade Centers and Pentagon resulted in increased federal funding for EP&R through the Health Resources Services Administration (HRSA). The associated October 2001 postal anthrax attacks targeting Congress also highlighted the importance of EP&R countermeasures. Anthrax response plans included the integration of pharmacies. 43 Pharmacists and pharmacy educators were included in CDC-led training programs in Atlanta for anthrax prophylaxis for the Strategic National Stockpile (SNS). Participants were encouraged to return home and further disseminate training information at the state and county level, which in turn involved pharmacy students and practitioners in POD exercises. The 2002/2003 global outbreak of SARS alerted the medical and scientific community of the virulence and potential impact of SARSs. 44 The resurgence of H1N1 in the 2009 pandemic illustrated the value of the SNS to stockpile and distribute antiviral agents, including EUAs for special uses, 45 as well as implementing restrictions to limit hoarding of antivirals. This further served to highlight the importance of pharmacists in ER&P response during pandemics as effective team members and gatekeepers, as well as increased integration of pharmacies and pharmacists into EP&R 17, 45 However, as noted by Gudi and Tiwari (2020) 46 , despite the contagiousness of H1N1 and the virulence of the 2003 SARS and more recent Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) outbreaks, these outbreaks did not spur maintenance of vibrant EP&R structures or rapidly deployable resources for public responses in preparation for the current pandemic. Thus, despite the widespread impacts of 1918 influenza, the most recent influenza pandemic in 2009, and ongoing MERS coronavirus outbreaks, hard lessons were unlearned, and there is an impaired response capability to public health emergencies such as the current pandemic. 47",

CAPE educational outcomes were published in 1992, 1998, 2004 and 2013. CAPE 2004, published shortly after September 11, 2001, granted prominence to public health, where it was one of the three major domains. 49 This provided a clear incentive for PharmD programs to build on or add curricular and co-curricular elements of public health, including EP&R.

The statement further calls for expanding current state pharmacists' immunization authority to include all FDA approved vaccines, including the forthcoming novel vaccine for COVID-19, for all indicated populations. During COVID-19, panic buying of PPEs and other goods set in leading to a shortage of PPEs for healthcare workers. Compounding sanitizers is well within the realm of compounding pharmacies and can serve to fill the gaps in PPE shortage for healthcare workers.",
