Since February 2020, doubts were raised about the numbers of confirmed cases and deaths reported by the Chinese government. In this paper, we examine data available from China at the city and provincial levels and we compare them with Canadian provincial data, US state data and French regional data. We consider cumulative and daily numbers of confirmed cases and deaths and examine these numbers through the lens of their first two digits and in particular we measure departures of these first two digits to the Newcomb-Benford distribution, often used to detect frauds. Our finding is that there is no evidence that cumulative and daily numbers of confirmed cases and deaths for all these countries have different first or second digit distributions. We also show that the Newcomb-Benford distribution cannot be rejected for these data.",

For each of the 32 datasets (2 digits, 4 countries, confirmed cases/deaths, daily/cumulative data), we perform a \u03c7 2 goodness-of-fit test to judge the adequacy of the Newcomb-Benford distribution. Since the sample size is not large for some datasets, we estimate the distribution of the standard \u03c7 2 statistic under H 0 using Monte Carlo 9 approach (B = 5000 replications are used). Figure 6 reports adjusted p-values in percentage. Given the quite large number of tests done in this paper, all p-values in this manuscript are adjusted as a whole, using a false discovery control procedure. Procedures which control false discovery rate are subject to assumptions on the distribution of p-values. The most well-known procedure is Benjamini-Hochberg's (BH) procedure (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995) which requires a PRDS assumption (positive regression type dependency, see Benjamini and Yekutieli (2001)). This assumption seems really complex and is probably wrong in the context of this paper: the number of deaths depends on the number of confirmed cases, the distribution of first digit is not independent of the distribution of second digit and cumulative data depend on daily data. All these characteristics have influence on the dependence on p-values. Thus, we also adjust pvalues using the Benjamini-Yekutieli's (BY) procedure (Benjamini and Yekutieli, 2001) which allows an FDR control under any type of dependence. Although BY's procedure is more conservative than the BH's procedure, it does control theoretically FDR at level 5%. Figure 6 presents raw values and adjusted p-values using BH and BY's procedures. Figure 6 reveals that no discovery can be made at FDR level 5%. The smallest BY's adjusted p-value equals 38.5% (note that even the smallest BH's adjusted p-value, 8.6%, is larger than 5%) and most of adjusted p-values are close or equal to 100%. Clearly, as every (omnibus) goodness-of-fit test should be interpreted, this does not prove that each dataset should be modeled by a Newcomb-Benford distribution (for the first or second digit) but tends to convince us that these models are legitimate. Figure 7 is less focused on the Newcomb-Benford model. We aim at measuring differences between the datasets by constructing 95% simultaneous confidence intervals.",

It seems impossible to draw any firm conclusion from Figure 7 that one dataset behaves differenty from other ones. Figure 8 strenghtens this comment. We report p-values for \u03c7 2 independence tests, where we test the distribution of counts for one dataset against the variable country. By count dataset, we mean here the distribution of counts for first or second digit, for daily or cumulative numbers of confirmed cases or deaths. For each such count distribution, we analyze through \u03c7 2 independence tests, either differences between different countries, or difference between China and other countries. All p-values (estimated using a Monte Carlo approach with B = 5000 replications) are adjusted using BH's procedure as well as BY's procedure.",

We find out that the Newcomb-Benford distribution for the first and second digits cannot be rejected at a false discovery rate 5%. This does not prove that the leading digits of epidemiological data should be modeled by Newcomb-Benford distribution. Nevertheless, it opens an interesting research question: could we prove that the first digits of data that fit SIR models (or extensions) follow the Newcomb-Benford distribution? This is clearly out of the scope of this note.",

For the city of Wuhan for instance, the cumulative number of deaths has remained between 2000 and 3000 since February, 25 and for several weeks in a row. So there would be a clear overexpression of the digit 2 for this time series data if we were to keep the same study period as for analyzing daily data. Thus, when we analyze cumulative data, we stopped the study period as of February 15, 2020 for Chinese data and April, 15 for other ones. Keeping cumulative numbers in the data analysis is highly relevant as there is a consensus in the epidemiological literature that numbers of cases or deaths grow exponentially and exponential curves are known to follow quite well the Newcomb-Benford distribution (see e.g. Berger and Hill, 2015).Tables 2 summarizes this section and provides as of May 12, 2020, the sample sizes available for analyzing first or second digit for each dataset.

The study period goes from December 2019 to May 12, 2020 for daily data and from December 2019 to mid-February (resp. mid-April) for Chinese data (resp. other data).Figures 2-5 summarize the efforts of this data analysis. For daily numbers (Figures 2-3) and cumulative numbers (Figures 4-5) of confirmed cases and deaths reported for China, Canada, USA and France, we estimate proportions of digits 1,2,. . . ,9 (for the first digit) and 0,1,. . . ,9 (for the second one). This information is represented by red curves (observed frequencies) in Figures 2-5. For each dataset (i.e. for first or second digit analysis, each type of data and each country), we also measure empirically departures from the Newcomb-Benford distribution. Thus, boxplots correspond to estimates of proportions of first or second digit based on B = 5000 simulations of sample size n from the Newcomb-Benford distribution. These figures do not constitute a formal goodness-of-fit test. This will be examined later taking into account the multiplicity of tests. However, it is clear that the Newcomb-Benford distribution seems to be an excellent candidate. Small departures to the Newcomb-Benford distribution seem noticeable in Figures 2 and 4: for instance digits 1 and 6 (resp. 1) for daily numbers of confirmed cases in China (resp. China), digit 3 for daily numbers of deaths in Canada, etc. Small departures are also noticeable in Figures 3 and 5. Because the sample size slightly decreases whenanalyzing second digits, violin boxplots exhibit slightly higher dispersion. most frequent, followed by 2, etc. As a second general conclusion, it does appear that the empirical distributions of digits for one type of data seem quite similar across countries.",
