The objectives of this study were to identify HMPV infections among children with influenza-like illness (ILI) in Wuhan and to assess circulation patterns and molecular diversity of HMPV in this area. From July 2008 to December 2013, a total of 3,883 throat swab samples were collected from ILI outpatients under 16 years old. HMPV RNA was detected in 171 samples (4.40%). All the four subtypes of HMPV were identified, among which A2 was the most common subtype (61/145, 42.1%), followed by B1, B2, and A1. During the study period, HMPV circulation presented a biennial alternation between high and low incidence in Wuhan and the seasonal peak also shift between winter and spring in two continuous seasons. Subtype A2, B1, and B2 co-circulated during the study period, with genotype A prevailing in epidemic season 2008-2009 and 2012-2013, and genotype B prevailing during other periods. This large-scale analysis of HMPV prevalence in ILI outpatient children improves the understanding of local HMPV circulation patterns and provides molecular epidemic evidence for comparative analysis of HMPV infection.",

HMPV is an enveloped negative-sense single-stranded RNA virus, belonging to the genus Metapneumovirus, subfamily Pneumovirinae, family Paramyxoviridae [van den . Serological studies indicate that most children below the age of 5 years will already have been infected by HMPV [van den Hoogen et al., 2001; Ebihara et al., 2003] . It generally accounts for 5-15% of hospitalization for lower and upper acute respiratory infections in children and the clinical manifestations ranging from otitis media to bronchiolitis and pneumonia [Kahn, 2006; Feuillet et al., 2012] . Adults infected by HMPV usually only present with flu-like symptoms [Boivin et al., 2002; Walsh et al., 2008] , but high morbidity is observed in the elderly and immunocompromised patients [Larcher et al., 2005; Kahn, 2006] .",

A national influenza surveillance system which tracks influenza-like illness (ILI) was launched in China in 2001 [Yang et al., 2009b] . Clinical samples of ILI patients are collected by sentinel hospitals every calendar week. In the present study, specimens from children with ILI were utilized to explore the circulation and epidemiology of HMPV in Wuhan, the largest city in central China which has a resident population over 10 million. Real-time RT-PCR assay was employed to evaluate the prevalence of HMPV infection and phylogenetic characteristics of HMPV isolates were also investigated.",

These controls were determined by Seeplex RV assay (Seegene, Seoul, Korea), a multiplex RT-PCR assay for the detection of 12 respiratory viruses, and confirmed by DNA sequencing. Participants' specimens were also tested for multiple other respiratory viruses using real-time RT-PCR assays [Peng et al., 2012] . Pathogens been tested included respiratory syncytial virus A and B, influenza virus A and B, parainfluenza virus 1, 2, and 3, human rhinovirus, human adenovirus, human coronavirus, and human bocavirus.",

Interestingly, although HMPV infection in Wuhan occurred more frequently in children under the age of five as expected, the highest prevalence was in children aged between 2 and 4 years, not in younger infants like many previous studies described [van den Hoogen et al., 2001; Williams et al., 2004; Lambert et al., 2007; Zhu et al., 2011] . One explanation is that the risk of exposure is higher among children between 2 and 4 because they are just entering kindergartens in this age. The observation might also be related to the higher virulence of HMPV in infants and young children [Boivin et al., 2002] . The virus has been demonstrated to be second only to RSV as a cause of bronchiolitis in early childhood [Kahn, 2006] , which leads to substantial proportion of hospitalization of younger patients. Children above 2 years old, on the other hand, are more immunocompetent and are more likely to become outpatient rather than be hospitalized during a HMPV infection. The majority of HMPV positive cases were diagnosed at the end of winter and early spring, which is the typical epidemic season of this virus in temperate zone [Kahn, 2006] . However, the seasonal distribution of HMPV in Wuhan varied in different study years. Three main epidemic peaks occurred first in the winter-spring season in year -2009 , then shifted to the springsummer season in year 2009-2010 (March to June), and finally back to the winter-spring season in year 2012-2013 (November to March). Multiple researchers from Europe and Asia also observed similar biennial shifts between winter and spring seasonality of HMPV. A significantly higher prevalence was identified in summer peak in Austria [Aberle et al., 2010] , in winter peak in Japan [Mizuta et al., 2013] , but not in Beijing [Zhu et al., 2011] , or Wuhan as shown in this study. Besides, the incidence of HMPV was not even in each season through the study. Two epidemic seasons with high viral activity were followed by two low activity epidemic seasons and again by a high activity epidemic season. The cause of different seasonality and yearly incidence is unclear. Our data did not support the assumption that circulation of different genotypes resulted in the change of temporal distribution, since no correlation was found between a certain HMPV genetic subgroup with high prevalence. But the possibility cannot be ruled out that environmental factors and circulation of other respiratory pathogens (such as the pandemic of A/H1N1/ 2009) have affected the epidemical dynamics of HMPV.",

Interestingly, a group of researchers from Chongqing, a city in Southwest China, has studied the epidemiology of HMPV among hospitalized children with acute lower respiratory tract infections between July 2008 and March 2011, yet they observed quite different seasonal distribution and prevailing genotype from Wuhan: subtype A2b was predominant during the whole period and peaked in March to May 2009 and November 2010 to February 2011 . Considering the 800 km linear distance between Chongqing and Wuhan, the difference was likely to be a result of geographic isolation as well as the distinction of study subjects.",

The only exception was an Italian study that reported the circulation of subtype A1 was predominant in season 2009-2010 [Apostoli et al., 2012] . The analysis of sequence diversity showed that nucleotide distance within HMPV subtypes was 0.007-0.011 and the corresponding amino acid distance was 0.000-0.004. Such low diversity might be explained by functional constraints on paramyxovirus fusion proteins that prevent progressive antigen drift [Yang et al., 2009a] . It has been identified that a region between residue 260-300 on F1 subunit of fusion protein presents considerable variation [Yang et al., 2009a] , but no amino acid substitution specific for Wuhan strains was noticed in this study. There were multiple closely related or even identical sequences from the same epidemic seasons or two consecutive seasons in clades B1 and B2, implicating that HMPV infections due to highly similar viruses within one period, at least in genotype B [Reiche et al., 2014] .",

Phylogenetic analysis revealed that all subtypes of HMPV were circulated in Wuhan, yet each genotype prevailed for 1-3 consecutive seasons. Strains in Wuhan were evolutionally conservative and multiple identical isolates were observed in one season. Since only limited information about the virus's prevalence and lineage distribution in the outpatient, these data improve the understanding of the local HMPV circulation patterns and genetic diversity.
