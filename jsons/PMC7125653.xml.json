Gene 1 (RNA polymerase gene) is located on the 5\u2032 end of the genome and is about 20 kb long. The remaining 7 kb of the genome consists of five genes: gene 2 (spike glycoprotein (S protein) gene), gene 3, gene 4 [membrane (M) protein gene], gene 5 and gene 6 (nucleocapsid (N) protein gene). In addition, an untranslated region (UTR) exists on the extreme 3\u2032 end of the genome. Gene 3 and gene 5 contain three (3a, 3b, 3c) and two (5a, 5b) open reading frames (ORFs), respectively. With the exception of gene 3c, which was recently shown to encode small membrane (sM) protein (Liu and Inglis, 1991; Smith et al., 1990), the products of all the other ORFs remain unknown.",

IBV strains may undergo substitution of large genomic fragments in multiple genes (Kusters et al., 1990; Wang et al., 1993; Jia et al., 1995). Although the individual genes (mostly S protein genes) of many IBV isolates have been sequenced (Binns et al., 1985, Binns et al., 1986a, Binns et al., 1986b; Boursnell et al., 1985; Cavanagh and Davis, 1988, Cavanagh and Davis, 1992; Cavanagh et al., 1992a; Jia et al., 1995; Wang et al., 1993; Williams et al., 1992, Williams et al., 1993), the complete sequence of the 3\u2032 end of the genome (whole genome except the RNA polymerase gene) of only one strain (Beaudette strain) of serotype Massachusetts (Mass), and a Japanese strain KB8523 have been determined so far (Boursnell et al., 1987; Sutou et al., 1988). The IBV strain CU-T2 described in this report was a unique strain which had apparently originated from Arkansas (Ark) serotype, had undergone recombination in two genes, and expressed both Ark and Mass epitopes on the S1 protein (Jia et al., 1995). In the previous study, we had reported the sequences of the S protein gene, the N protein gene and the 3\u2032-UTR of this strain. Here, we report the sequences of all the remaining 3\u2032 end genes of CU-T2: gene 3, M protein gene and gene 5.",

Of those strains, UK/183/66 and UK/68/84 are non-Mass serotype strains (Cavanagh et al., 1992b), whereas Portugal/322/82 strain belongs to Mass serotype (Cavanagh et al., 1992b). However, the latter strain and strain KB8523 were possible recombinants, with recombinant fragments located between 3\u2032 end of S protein gene and gene 3. (Cavanagh et al., 1992b; Sutou et al., 1988). The overall nt sequence of CU-T2 gene 3 compared with sequences of the six strains listed in Table 1, which showed homologies between 84.1% and 90.8%. Except Portugal/322/82 and KB8523, however, there were only about 85% homologies between the CU-T2 and the prototype Mass strains (i.e., Mass41 and Beaudette) or the non-Mass and non-Ark serotype. It was earlier reported that some non-Mass IBV isolates contained deletions in the 3\u2032 end of gene 3, and, as an exception, the Mass serotype Portugal/322/82 also had a similar deletion (Cavanagh and Davis, 1988; Cavanagh et al., 1992b). In this study, CU-T2 was found to have a 23 nt deletion in that region compared to a 32 nt deletion in Portugal/322/82, a 9 nt deletion in UK/68/84, and a 6 nt deletion in UK/183/66. Thus, results of the percentage homology and the deletions in gene 3 nt sequences suggested that Ark-like IBV has a relatively distant evolutionary relationship with the Mass serotype strains and non-Mass and non-Ark serotype. Besides the nt sequences, the deduced aa sequences of gene 3a, 3b and 3c of CU-T2 were also compared with published sequences (Table 1). The overall aa sequence homologies of 3a (between 81% and 86.2%) and 3c (between 84% and 90.4%) were close to those of the respective nt sequences. However, the homologies of putative 3b aa sequences were between 87.5% and 95.4%, which showed an average of 6.5% and 4.1% higher homologies than 3a and 3c, respectively. The result suggested that the 3b region is relatively more conserved compared to regions 3a and 3c. In addition, a hydrophobic region found at the amino-terminal region of the 3c protein, which was adjacent to a cysteine-rich region in CU-T2, was similar to that found in other coronaviruses (Siddell, 1995).",

A total of 7349 nt were found in a region beginning from the 5\u2032 end of S protein gene to the 3\u2032 end of CU-T2 genome, compared to 7355 and 7301 nt reported for KB8523 and Beaudette strains, respectively. The sequence CTGAACAA found at the starting sites of S protein gene and gene 3 of CU-T2, and the sequence CTTAACAA found at the start of M protein gene, gene 5 and N protein gene, respectively, were identical to those found in the identical sites in Beaudette and KB8523 strains. The overall sequence of the CU-T2 genome distal to the RNA polymerase gene was found to have 87% homology with the equivalent regions of the Beaudette and KB8523 strains (compared with 92% homology between the latter two strains themselves). This suggested once again that Ark-like IBV probably has a relatively distant evolutionary relationship with the Mass as well as non-Mass and non-Ark serotypes.

Allantoic fluid collected 40 h after virus inoculation was stored at \u221270\u00b0C. Virus was purified by sucrose density gradient centrifugation (Sutou et al., 1988), and genomic RNA extracted with phenol-chloroform was used for cDNA synthesis. An oligonucleotide primer complementary to a conserved region of the S genes of several Mass serotype strains containing an XhoI restriction site and an eight nucleotide spacer (5\u2032-GAACTAGTCTCGAGGAAGGACGTGGGACTTTG-3\u2032) was synthesized. This primer was found to bind to downstream 3\u2032 end sequences of several genes (i.e., gene 3, M protein gene, and N protein gene) on the IBV genome, therefore it was used for the first strand cDNA synthesis. After blunt-ending the cDNA with T4 DNA polymerase, EcoRI adapters were added to the ends of the cDNAs. Following EcoRI and XhoI digestion, the cDNA fragments were cloned into EcoRI/XhoI sites in \u03bb-ZAP vector (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA). The cDNA library was packaged using Gigapack II Gold packaging extract (Stratagene). Escherichia coli (E. coli) containing the library were plated onto NZY plates and duplicated onto nitrocellulose filters. The positive plaques were identified by hybridization with a 5\u2032 end-radiolabeled probe prepared from a StyI fragment derived from plasmid pBSM41M, which contained the S gene of Mass41. Phagemids containing CU-T2 genes were obtained by in vivo excision in (E. coli) strain XL-1 using a protocol furnished by Stratagene. A total of 27 positive clones were obtained. Three of them were characterized.",
