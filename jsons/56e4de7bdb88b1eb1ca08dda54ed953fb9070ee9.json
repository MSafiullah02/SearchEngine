Estimating the effectiveness of these socialdistancing strategies is challenging because surveillance of COVID-19 has been limited, with tests generally being prioritized for high-risk or hospitalized cases according to temporally and regionally varying criteria. Here we show that reductions in mobility across U.S. counties with at least 100 confirmed cases of COVID-19 led to reductions in fever incidences, as captured by smart thermometers, after a mean lag of 6.5 days (90% within 3-10 days) that is consistent with the incubation period of COVID-19. Furthermore, counties with larger decreases in mobility subsequently achieved greater reductions in fevers (p < 0.01), with the notable exception of New York City and its immediate vicinity. These results indicate that social distancing has reduced",

Such interventions seek to limit opportunities for transmission by reducing the number of individuals exposed by each newly infected individual. That is, social distancing is intended to decrease the reproductive number of COVID-19 [24, 26] . Implemented social distancing policies in the United States have included closing businesses, restricting large gatherings, and encouraging or requiring residents to stay at home unless undertaking essential tasks [11] . These strategies complement other non-pharmaceutical interventions such as contact tracing and isolation or quarantine of individuals suspected to be infected with COVID- 19 [11, 13, 46] .",

Confirmed COVID-19 case counts are difficult to interpret, however, owing to uncertainties associated with what fraction of cases are captured in test statistics [15, 43] and high false-negative rates associated with tests [52] . Furthermore, case reports inevitably lag the onset of illness [48] . Other studies have used deaths from  which are more likely to be recorded than infections, but these represent a small portion of the population and lag disease transmission by two or more weeks [53] .",

By way of example, attempts to predict seasonal influenza from Google search patterns appeared skillful over multiple seasons, but failed to forecast the 2009 H1N1 (\"Swine Flu\") pandemic and overestimated the spread of the 2013 seasonal influenza in the United States by a factor of nearly two [2, 6, 22, 40] .

There are several sources of uncertainty in assessing the degree to which changes in mobility are responsible for changes in fever incidence, foremost that mobility and fever incidence are proxies for the actual variables of interest. The distance traveled by smartphone users does not, for example, account for the fact that walking on a crowded street involves greater likelihood of close human contact than does driving on an open highway. Similarly, fever data do not distinguish between cases arising from COVID-19, influenza, or any other illness that causes fever. Furthermore, the contribution of COVID-19 is difficult to estimate using fever statistics from previous years because mobility changes are expected to influence transmission of most febrile respiratory infections. The signal of COVID-19 in fever data is also expected to under-represent its actual spread in the population because only approximately 40% of COVID-19 cases manifest with fevers [30] . An additional source of uncertainty arises from seasonality. ILI is strongly seasonal, decreasing through March and April in most years regardless of changes in mobility [28] , and COVID-19 dynamics may also be found to be seasonal, albeit to an unknown extent [29] . These factors inform our decision to focus on county-level patterns in the rates of fractional fever reduction as opposed to the absolute magnitude of fever declines.",

Specifically, a mobility-induced change in fever incidence should lag the change of mobility by a time equal to or longer than the incubation period of COVID-19. We estimate the lead or lag between reductions of mobility and reduction in fevers as the time shift that minimizes their mean-squared difference. The lead-lag analysis is computed using time-series of F and M as defined in the methods section, from March 5th, selected for being prior to systematic changes in mobility, to April 15, representing the most current data at the time of our analysis. On average, changes in fevers are found to lag changes in mobility by 6.5 days, with 95% of the 368 counties included in the analysis having lags between 3 and 10 days ( Figures   1 and S1 ). This lag agrees with independent estimates of the incubation period of COVID-19 as averaging 6 days and ranging between 2 and 14 days [19, 21, 23, 25] . Observed lags are also consistent with estimates for negative growth rates of COVID-19 cases occurring 8 to 12 days after nation-wide restriction in travel in China [18], once accounting for the fact that an additional lag averaging 4.8 days arises between the onset of symptoms, such as fever, and the confirmation of a COVID-19 infection.",

In contrast, the observed decline in fevers in 2020 is more than double the expected value with an average \u03b4F of 79%.

Two potential concerns with such a simple regression are that the p-value is estimated assuming that counties are independent, and that noise in the predictor values causes regression dilution [9] that biases results toward a shallower slope. A second regression is, therefore, performed after spatially averaging mobility and fever reductions into 5 \u2022 latitude by 5 \u2022 longitude bins such that data from 368 counties are represented by 34 grid boxes that are expected to have greater independence and less noise. Regression at this 5 \u2022 by 5 \u2022 scale gives a steeper slope indicating a 2.1 \u00b1 0.6% reduction in fever incidence per 10% reduction in mobility (p < 0.01) that we consider to be more accurate ( Figure S3 ).",

Such a relationship is expected, as noted, on the basis of the seasonality associated with influenza [28], although seasonality is only expected to account for approximately one-third of the intercept value. A greater-than-expected y-intercept may arise if COVID-19 also responds to seasonal changes in environmental conditions, although whether such a sensitivity exists is presently unclear [29] . Additional factors may include broad adoption of behaviors that limit disease transmission but may not influence travel distances -such as individuals remaining more dispersed in public, regularly disinfecting surfaces, and more fre- The other major feature associated with the regression is a cluster of outliers that share the distinction of being near New York City (Figure 3a) , and which are treated separately in the following subsection.

In contrast with China's restrictions on travel to and from Wuhan that appear to have dramatically reduced the city's ability to seed new outbreaks elsewhere [5, 18] , New York City opted instead to focus on local social-distancing efforts [11] . The outstanding question for this region then appears to be why rates of fever have remained relatively high in New York City despite its massive reduction in mobility, with possibilities including that the city is more densely populated than any other in the U.S. [7, 45] and that it may have experienced substantial community spread of COVID-19",

Many U.S. counties with large reductions in mobility achieve near-zero fever incidences by early April, indicating that severe curtailment of mobility is effective in reducing disease transmission. Some counties in Midwestern states, however, achieve similar outcomes with more moderate mobility reductions, and New York City has only partially reduced fevers despite strong decreases in mobility. These counter-examples highlight that regional disparities in demographics, climate, or the delay before implementing mobility restrictions are also potentially of first-order importance for explaining and predicting the spread of COVID-19.",

            "text": "The corollary to social distancing being effective is the question of the optimal degree of mobility restriction for purposes of controlling the spread of COVID-19. Foregoing studies have generally drawn inferences from confirmed case statistics [5, 13, 18, 20] , but these lag actual infections by up to several weeks and are subject to heterogeneous and potentially biased reporting, making it challenging to infer causality in case growth rates and possibly allowing outbreaks to spread through communities before a response can be mounted. Our combining cellphone mobility insights with smart-thermometer fever data permits for more rapidly assessing the timing and rates of change in illness incidence. By leveraging existing data sources for disease surveillance, approaches like the one we have employed may enable timely monitoring of the effectiveness of mobility restrictions and, thereby, support efforts to contain emerging outbreaks [8] . The importance of such capabilities is underscored by the possibility that COVID-19 outbreaks will recur seasonally and require prolonged or intermittent social distancing [16] . Figure 1 : Variations in mobility, fever incidence, and confirmed COVID-19 cases for an example county in each of 45 U.S. states. Each panel shows a mobility index (green), the estimated percentage of individuals experiencing fevers (black), and new daily COVID-19 cases (gray shading). The midpoint of mobility reductions (green dot) is used to define an early fever interval, corresponding to F 1 , over the preceding 10 days (red line), and a later fever interval, F 2 , between 10 to 20 days afterwards (purple line). COVID-19 cases are normalized such that their maximum value aligns with the upper limit of the y-axis, and the mobility index is centered such that its maximum value equals the average fever incidence during F 1 . Both COVID-19 cases and mobility are smoothed using a seven-day moving average. Panel labels indicate two-letter state abbreviations and county FIPS code (see Table S1 ). Omitted states have no county with more than 100 confirmed COVID-19 cases as of April 10, 2020. Figure 1 ). Counties having more than 100 confirmed COVID-19 cases as of April 10, 2020 (indicated by cross marks) are included in regression analyses shown in Figure 3 .

Although, in principle, \u03b4M could be ambiguous with respect to increasing or decreasing values of mobility, in practice, all smoothed mobility data show a clear structure of nearly stable values followed by a marked decline. If \u03b4M was computed between January 1 and March 4 it would average only 10%, whereas in our selected March 5 to April 15 window \u03b4M averages 54%, with 95% of counties having values between 21% and 96%.
