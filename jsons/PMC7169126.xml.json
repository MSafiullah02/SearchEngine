            "text": "KT is the treatment of choice for ESRD and results in increases in the duration and quality of life for patients 1. Worldwide, the number of KTs increases each year. In the USA, among the 571,000 patients treated for ESRD in 2009, 30% (171,000) received a renal allograft compared with 27% (93,000) in 1998 2, 3. In France, in 2010, the prevalence of ESRD patients treated by KT was 44.4% (29,841 patients) 4. However, successful transplantation requires the administration of immunosuppressive therapies to prevent allograft rejection, which is inextricably linked to infection. Anti\u2010infective regimens make immunosuppressive therapies safer, but they do not completely prevent the occurrence or increased severity of infectious diseases. Thus, infections remain an important concern and constitute the second\u2010leading cause of mortality among KTRs behind cardiovascular complications 2, 5. Viruses are the most important cause of infections and represent a major source of morbidity and mortality 6, 7, 8. KTRs may acquire viral infections through exogenous routes, including community exposure, the donor organ, and blood products or by endogenous reactivation of latent viruses 6. Virus\u2010associated diseases may manifest as direct illness or indirect effects mediated by immunomodulation 6, and viruses will more fully display their potential dangerousness in KTRs than in immune\u2010competent individuals 9. In KTRs, the most typical viral infections are those caused by Herpesviridae, hepatitis viruses, HIV, and Papillomaviridae\n8, 10. However, several emerging viral diseases have recently been highlighted in this population.",

Emerging viral diseases are diseases that newly appear in a population or that have been recognized earlier but whose incidence or geographical range is increasing. Re\u2010emerging viral diseases are diseases that re\u2010appear in a same or different geographical area. Emergence can correspond to the appearance of new viruses or can rely on migrations of people, reservoir, or vectors, on new environmental conditions, new behaviors, or new medical practices. Alternatively, emergence can reflect an improved awareness by clinicians of the disease, which leads to an increase in testing and diagnosis. Finally, emergence can rely on the implementation of new diagnostic tools that reveal levels of incidence and prevalence previously underestimated. Recent decades have been very favorable for the emergence of viral agents and viral diseases. Notably, urbanization and globalization have shown dramatic expansions 12. Concurrently, new technologies and medical practices have been implemented or their use has been increasing, as is the case for organ transplantation 5, and the tools for scientific and medical information have grown significantly 13, 14. Moreover, the number and performance of viral detection methods have evolved dramatically over the last decades 15. Particularly, molecular methods have been increasingly implemented in clinical virology and have considerably impacted this field by allowing the rapid detection of viruses, including those that cannot be cultivated in the laboratory.",

BKV was first isolated in 1970 from a KTR who presented with a ureteral stenosis 17. The virus was named BKV after the initials of this patient (Table 1). BKV was discovered well before the clinical consequences of infection could be appreciated in KTRs. In 1993, the first case of BKV interstitial nephritis was diagnosed by a renal allograft biopsy in a patient with acute renal failure 18, 19. Infections with BKV and JCV occur early in life and are benign 20. In blood donors, the IgG seroprevalence was 82% and 58% for BKV and JCV, respectively, whereas viruria rates were 7% and 19%. Neither BKV nor JCV was detected in plasma 21. The distribution of latent viruses in different tissues is thought to occur during the primary viremia. The best\u2010known site of BKV and JCV latency is the urogenital tract, and BK viral sequences can be detected in the bladder, in prostate tissues, and in kidneys (in up to 57%) procured from asymptomatic individuals 22, 23, 24. After KT, the incidence of viruria increased to 35% for JCV and 16% for BKV, and infection by one polyomavirus was negatively associated with reactivation of the other 16. BKV reactivation most likely occurs in the cells of the donor kidney 20.",

Pathologists retrospectively reviewed all renal allograft biopsies performed between 1985 and 1995 in Basel, Switzerland but could not authenticate any cases 26. Thus, it is unlikely that the increase in the incidence of BKVAN is merely the result of increased awareness. The prevalence of BKVAN in recent studies is between 1% and 10% 25, 27. A large retrospective KTR cohort analysis revealed that the rates of treatment of BKV continued to increase in the time period from 2003 to 2006 28. The different prevalence rates in different geographical areas most likely reflect local immunosuppression protocols and diagnostic approaches rather than true differences in BKV epidemiology. Risk factors for BKV infection may be donor, recipient, allograft, or virus related. The intensity of immunosuppression is the greatest risk factor for BKV infection and thus BKVAN, and the immunosuppressive therapy is the most modifiable factor 29. BKVAN may affect SOTRs other than KTRs, but the preferential development in the renal allograft may be due to a microenvironment permissive for BKV replication 16.",

BKVAN presents as renal dysfunction without other clinical manifestations 25, 29. The diagnosis of BKVAN requires a renal allograft biopsy and is demonstrated by presence of intranuclear viral inclusions in tubular epithelial (Figure 4) and/or glomerular parietal cells, which is often associated with epithelial cell necrosis and acute tubular injury 25. Histological studies indicate that BKVAN progresses schematically through three histologic patterns 25. Viral cytopathic changes initially predominate (pattern A). A cytopathic\u2010inflammatory stage without significant fibrosis (pattern B) and a late stage with predominant tubular atrophy and fibrosis (pattern C) follow them. Patterns B and C were significantly associated with allograft loss 25. Viral\u2010induced tubular inflammation is morphologically indistinguishable from acute cellular allograft rejection, and in the early years of BKVAN emergence, misdiagnosis of acute cellular rejection instead of viral nephritis likely resulted in unnecessary antirejection treatment that could inflate rates of allograft loss of 50%\u2013100% recorded in earlier studies. A proactive approach to accurate and early diagnosis has decreased the incidence of BKVAN\u2010related graft loss to less than 10% 27. Reactivation of BKV in the ureter can manifest as a ureteric stenosis, and in the bladder, it can manifest as a hemorrhagic cystitis 30. Renal cell carcinoma of the graft and carcinoma of the bladder are increasingly considered complications of BKV's oncogenic properties 27, 31.",

JCV is the causative agent of PML in immunodeficient patients, but it has not been established if PML results from primary infection or reactivation of the latent virus. The normal brain may be a site of JCV latency, and the reactivation of the virus can lead to lytic infection of glial cells and to the onset of PML in the case of failure of immunosurveillance 34. However, PML occurs rarely in KTRs. In a retrospective study, there were nine cases of PML identified among 32,757 adult KTRs, which corresponded to an incidence of 8.8 cases/100,000 person\u2010years 35. Since the review of the literature by Crowder et al. in 2005 that listed 13 cases of PML in KTRs, only three new cases have been reported 36, two cases in children 37, 38 and a third in an adult following rituximab treatment for a PTLD 39.

Balayan presented with hepatitis after ingestion of a pooled stool extract of patients and detected the virus in his stool by EM 62. HEV is a leading cause of acute hepatitis in adults in developing countries, where it is hyperendemic, of genotype 1 or 2, and principally water borne 63. In developed countries, hepatitis E was first considered imported from HEV hyperendemic geographical areas but is currently an emerging autochthonous (i.e. locally acquired) disease and a porcine zoonosis caused by HEV genotype 3 or 4 63. Hepatitis E typically causes an acute and self\u2010limiting infection in immune\u2010competent individuals. However, fulminant hepatitis and high mortality are described, reaching 25% in cases involving pregnancy in developing countries and 70% in cases involving underlying liver disease 63. The first case of HEV infection in a KTR was reported in 2003 in India 64. The patient died of severe acute pancreatitis attributed to HEV infection with elevated serum alanine aminotransferase and bilirubin levels, positive anti\u2010HEV IgM, and a surprisingly normal serum amylase level. European autochthonous acute HEV infections in KTRs were first described in Toulouse, France 65. The incidence of HEV infections has been estimated to be 2.7 cases/100 person\u2010years after KT in southwestern France 63. The only independent predictive factor for HEV infection in SOTRs is the consumption of game meat 63. In KTRs, acute hepatitis E is mostly asymptomatic 66. Liver enzyme levels are lower, and histological lesions are less severe than those seen in immune\u2010competent individuals 67. Various extrahepatic manifestations have been described in KTRs in association with HEV infections, including transient cryoglobulinemia, glomerulonephritis 63, and neurological symptoms involving both the peripheral and CNS 63.",

Chronic hepatitis E is defined as hepatitis and persistent infection documented by PCR, lasting for more than 6 months. The incidence of chronic evolution after HEV infection has been estimated to be 51% in KTRs 66. Clinical studies suggest that the occurrence and persistence of chronic hepatitis E are related to the immunological status of patients. Indeed, this form of hepatitis E is described only in severely immunocompromised patients, especially SOTRs, HIV\u2010infected patients, and individuals with hematological diseases 63. In pooled SOTRs, the occurrence of chronic hepatitis E has been related to the dose of immunosuppressants 66, 69. As in the acute form, chronic hepatitis E is often subclinical in KTRs, with mild liver abnormalities (Figure 4). Twenty\u2010seven chronic hepatitis E cases have been reported in Western Europe since 2008 66, 68, 70, 71, 72. Evolution to cirrhosis may occur rapidly after HEV infection 68, 73.

            "text": "PVB19 was discovered in 1975 during systematic screening of hepatitis B in nine healthy blood donors, a patient with acute hepatitis, and a patient who received a renal allograft 1 week earlier, without a specific illness having been associated with PVB19 at that time (Table 1) 74. Primary PVB19 infection most often occurs early in life 75. In immune\u2010competent individuals, PVB19 infection is generally asymptomatic but may manifest in children as a mild rash called erythema infectiosum or fifth disease and in adults as a polyarthritis 75. The first description of hypoplastic crisis during PVB19 infection dates to 1981 in patients with sickle\u2010cell anemia 76. The clearance of the virus is usually complete, but some studies have demonstrated ongoing viral replication in the blood and suggested that PVB19 could establish a persistent infection in the kidney 23, 77. The mechanisms of infection after KT are either primary infection or reactivation of a latent infection 75, 78, 79. PVB19 transmission most commonly occurs through the respiratory tract. Moreover, nosocomial outbreaks in transplant units have been reported 79. The persistence of viral replication in the blood and kidneys could result in transmission of PVB19 in KTRs from the renal allograft or blood products 23, 77. The prevalence of PVB19 infection is estimated to be between 2% and 30% in KTRs 80, 81. The difference in incidence between the early and late 2000s may be explained by the increased use of molecular techniques in diagnosis and surveillance in the late 2000s 82, 83. Eid et al. reviewed 98 cases of PVB19 infection after transplantation in 2006 75. Among these cases, 53 have occurred after KT. The median time to infection was 1.25 months. The most common manifestation was anemia (in 98.1% of KTRs), whereas the most frequent clinical symptom was fever (23.9%) 75. Anemia results from the viral replication in erythroid progenitors, leading to their apoptosis, and is typically refractory and severe. More rarely, leukopenia (34%) and thrombocytopenia (19.1%) were present. Renal graft dysfunction and hepatitis existed in 15.6% and 6.5% of the KTRs, respectively 75. Collapsing glomerulopathy and thrombotic microangiopathy have been reported in renal allografts 79. Other manifestations were seldom reported, including pneumonitis, encephalitis, myocarditis, and hemophagocytic syndrome 79. Bone marrow examination typically reveals red cell aplasia (Figure 4). Diagnosis of PVB19 infection is based on serological tests, blood/bone marrow PCR, and bone marrow examination 79. The persistence of viral replication in the blood has been demonstrated in KTRs several months after the correction of the hematologic abnormalities 79. Chronic infection can manifest as chronic anemia or relapses of anemia 78, 84, 85. The relapses of anemia are more frequent after primary infection 84. Recurrences of PVB19 infections occur in 34% of the KTRs 75.",

Severe disease has been noted in children, pregnant women, and people with comorbid disorders including chronic lung or heart disease, diabetes, and obesity 88. In SOTRs, pandemic H1N1 resulted in a spectrum of illness ranging from mild and self\u2010limiting to severe disease. The largest study reported data on 237 SOTRs from North America; of which, the majority (37%) was KTRs 89. The most common presenting symptoms were cough, fever, myalgias, rhinorrhoea, sore throat, and headache. Lung imaging showed pneumonia in 32% of patients. H1N1 was diagnosed by PCR on nasopharyngeal swabs (Figure 4). The incidence of hospitalization was 71%, and the rate of admission to the intensive care unit was 16%. Of these patients, 21 needed mechanical ventilation. Two adults and one child received extracorporeal membrane oxygenation.
