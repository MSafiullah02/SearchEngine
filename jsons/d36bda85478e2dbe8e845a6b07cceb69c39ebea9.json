The engineer who attempts to deal with microbial indoor air quality finds that pertinent microbiological information exists in abundance but not in easily digestible forms.

Healthcare facilities, such as hospitals, have to pay particular care to prevent the spread of airborne infectious diseases. Many of those who are susceptible to these problems may be patients such as people with preexisting health problems, the frail elderly, people with cancer who are going through treatment, and those who may have depressed immune systems. Some hospitals also have special units that need particular care in terms of indoor air quality such as bone marrow units, neonatal intensive care units, and burn units. It is not only patients who are at risk. Healthcare workers have a higher risk than most people of being infected by airborne diseases. For example, healthcare workers who work at facilities in cities have positive tuberculosis (TB) skin tests (meaning they have been exposed to the TB bacteria) about eight times more often than the rest of the population. In addition, at least 17 healthcare workers have developed drug-resistant TB as a result of working in these environments [1] .",

Some fungal species, most notably Aspergillus and Penicillium, are often found to account for 80 percent of indoor spores [3] . Spores will germinate and grow in the presence of moisture and nutrients in locations such as basements, drain pans, and on refrigerator coils. If spore concentrations indoors consistently exceed outdoor levels, the building can be inferred to contain an indoor amplifier [3] . Table 3 identifies some pathogenic environmental bacteria that have been found growing indoors or on HVAC equipment. Amplification may result in airborne concentrations above the outdoors and may reach unhealthy levels. Legionnaire's Disease provides a sentinel example of pathogenic microbial amplification by an engineered system. Occasionally, some contagious bacteria disseminated from humans can be found in water, equipment, or in dust, but these are transient occupants and unlikely to grow or survive long outside of human hosts.
