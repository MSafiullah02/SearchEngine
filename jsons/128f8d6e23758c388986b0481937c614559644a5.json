This article analyses the risks of contamination among healthcare professionals (HCPs) during laparoscopic surgery on patients with Covid-19. Harmful effects of aerosols from a pneumoperitoneum with the virus present have not yet been quantified. Measures for the protection of HCPs are an extrapolation of those taken during other epidemics. They must still be mandatory to minimise the risk of viral contamination. Protection measures include personal protection equipment for HCPs, adaptation of surgical technique (method for obtaining pneumoperitoneum, filters, preferred intracorporeal anastomosis, precautions during the exsufflation of the pneumoperitoneum), and organisation of the operating room.",

This article specifically concerns the risk of viral contamination during laparoscopy in the setting of the current Covid-9 epidemic. Our purpose here is to analyse the literature data on the viral contamination risk for HCPs by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus responsible for the Covid-19 epidemic and discuss means of protection and prevention. with cases of laryngeal papillomatosis, recognized as an occupational illness in one nurse [2] . In the 2000s, it was difficult for researchers to measure the biological activity of viral DNA in order to assess its infectiousness [3] . However, viable HIVs have been found in cell cultures, especially when aerosolgenerating devices are used, although the viability of HIVs is still being debated, and the potential risk of contamination by smoke has not been quantifiable.

The aerosol from the pneumoperitoneum was trapped in a filter, where the authors found HBV in 10 instances out of 11.

Moreover, the ultrasonic systems often used do not produce enough heat to deactivate the virus. These concerns are confirmed by a recent experimental study showing that after 10 minutes of laparoscopic dissection by electrosurgery or ultrasound, the concentration of particles measuring 0.3-0.5 \u00b5m was higher with laparoscopy than with laparotomy [7] . Owing to the low rate of replacement of the pneumoperitoneum gas, leaked aerosol may thus contain high concentrations of suspended viruses [8] . This suggests that the risk of contamination of HCPs may be greater in laparoscopy than in laparotomy, particularly if accidental gas leakage occurs or exsufflation is poorly controlled. Other authors [9] have claimed the opposite, arguing that the closed surgical site (relative to laparotomy) lowers the risk of contamination, and that there is no hard evidence yet that the viruses are viable or that they are actually transmitted during laparoscopy.",

FFP2 masks meet the filter efficiency criteria of the NIOSH [21]. To be effective, these masks must, however, be used correctly and be properly fitted. b. Laparoscopy equipment and surgical technique The risk of contamination of HCPs is highest during the insertion of trocars, extraction of the excised tissues and removal of trocars at the end of the operation.
