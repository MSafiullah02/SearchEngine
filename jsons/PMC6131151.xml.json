We and others have shown that elevated CO2 inhibits LPS-induced expression of IL-6 and TNF in macrophages, fibroblasts and alveolar epithelial cells13,14. We also found that hypercapnia impairs bacterial clearance through inhibition of both phagocytosis and autophagy in macrophages13,15. Moreover, hypercapnia worsened lung injury and decreased bacterial clearance in mechanically ventilated rats with E. coli pneumonia16 and increased the mortality of Pseudomonas pneumonia in mice17. In the latter study, elevated CO2 decreased the early release of TNF, IL-6 and multiple chemokines into the lung, inhibited bacterial phagocytosis and NADPH-oxidase-mediated reactive oxygen species generation by lung neutrophils, and increased bacterial loads in the lungs and other organs17. Hypercapnia was also shown to inhibit alveolar fluid clearance in the rat lung, which was due to downregulation of Na,K-ATPase activity caused by endocytosis of the enzyme due to activation of AMP-activated kinase and PKC-zeta18,19. Additionally, elevated CO2 inhibited proliferation of alveolar epithelial cells and lung fibroblasts, which resulted from mitochondrial dysfunction triggered by mirR-183-dependent downregulation of isocitrate mitochondrial dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2)20. Thus, hypercapnia adversely affects innate immune responses, host defense, lung edema clearance, and proliferation of cells required for lung repair. Notably, in almost all of the foregoing studies, elevated CO2 produced these effects independently of acidosis.",

The airway epithelium is the first line of defense against inhaled pathogens and other noxious agents, and its integrity is critical for host defense and maintenance of lung homeostasis21,22. Also, diseases associated with hypercapnia including COPD, asthma, cystic fibrosis and ARDS are all characterized by airway epithelial dysfunction23\u201326. Thus, in the current study we examined the effect of hypercapnia on global gene expression in normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells that were differentiated at the air-liquid interface (ALI). We show that exposure for 24 h to normoxic hypercapnia (20% CO2), as opposed to normocapnia (5% CO2) downregulates genes linked to innate immunity, host defense, and nucleosome assembly and upregulates genes required for cholesterol biosynthesis and lipid metabolism. These changes in gene expression indicate the potential for hypercapnia to alter bronchial epithelial cell function in ways that may contribute to poor clinical outcomes in patients with severe acute or advanced chronic lung diseases.",

Microarray global gene expression analysis revealed that hypercapnia significantly modified the expression of 309 genes \u2265\u00b11.4 fold (expressed as log2 [fold change]) with an adjusted P value \u2264 0.05. This represents only 1.5% of the 20,390 transcripts represented on the Affymetrix chip, indicating that the impact of elevated CO2 on gene expression is highly selective. The proportion of genes whose expression was significantly upregulated (126) or downregulated (183) in response to high CO2 is depicted in Fig. 1a. Differential gene expression is also represented as a volcano plot of log2 (fold change ratio) vs. \u2212log10 (P values) (Fig. 1b) and as a heat map with hierarchical clustering (Supplementary Fig. 1a). The names and fold-changes for all genes downregulated or upregulated by \u22651.4 fold are listed in Supplementary Tables 1,2, respectively. These transcriptional changes cannot be attributed to cytotoxicity since exposure to 20% CO2 for 24 h caused no increase in LDH release from the cells (Supplementary Fig. 2).",

To validate the microarray results related to CO2-induced changes in key immunoregulatory genes, expression of CXCL1, CXCL14, CCL28, ILR6 and TLR4 was also assessed by qPCR.

Of importance, we utilized primary NHBE cells cultured at ALI to achieve a differentiated state closely resembling normal human bronchial epithelium. Our principal finding was that hypercapnia altered expression of a small number of specific genes (309 out of 20,390 transcripts assayed, or 1.5%) in differentiated NHBE cells. Of these, 183 genes (59%) were downregulated, while 126 (41%) were upregulated. Thus, the effects of elevated CO2 are highly selective, involving both differential repression and differential activation of specific gene subsets. The overwhelming majority of these genes were not previously known to be regulated by CO2. Furthermore, gene ontogeny analysis showed enrichment of hypercapnia-regulated genes involved in a variety of fundamentally important cellular processes. Altering expression of genes related to these processes would be expected to impart functional changes in bronchial epithelial cells, which could in turn influence the pathophysiology and outcomes of many respiratory diseases.",

Hypercapnia also upregulated CD55 and CD86, which bind virus at the cell surface32,33. While hypercapnia downregulated TLR4, it increased the expression of IL1RL1, which has been shown to inhibit TLR4 activation34. Of note, Schneberger et al. previously reported that hypercapnia reduced LPS-induced secretion of IL-6 and IL-8 in the airway epithelial cell line BEAS-2B35. These observations are relevant because of the well-documented role of TLR4 in host defense against multiple respiratory pathogens36\u201340. Interestingly, airway epithelial TLR4 expression was reduced in patients with severe COPD as compared to those with less severe COPD41, possibly due to hypercapnia in patients with advanced disease. Reduced expression of immune response genes was also seen in the lungs of newborn mice exposed to moderate hypercapnia (8% CO2) for the first two weeks of life42. While the immune genes downregulated by hypercapnia in the newborn mice differed from those we found in NHBE cells, the mucosal immunity chemokine CXCL1443 was commonly downregulated in both systems. Taken together, these observations indicate that the airway epithelium is an important target for hypercapnic suppression of innate immune gene expression. This, along with the suppressive effects of elevated CO2 on macrophage, neutrophil, alveolar epithelial cell functions13\u201315,17\u201319 likely contributes to the deleterious impact of elevated CO2 on lung injury and host defense.",

Downregulation of histone gene expression can be triggered by DNA-damage or indirect inhibition of DNA synthesis46 and might lead to alterations of chromatin structure that would influence transcriptional regulation of many genes and even genome stability47. Exchange of core histones with histone variants might also alter the chemical nature and physical properties of the nucleosome, thereby affecting distinct cellular processes48.

However, in the current study, hypercapnia did not alter IDH2 expression in NHBE cells, indicating that CO2-mediated regulation of gene expression is cell-type-specific. On the other hand, a number of genes involved in mitochondrial function were regulated by hypercapnia in NHBE cells. Among these, upregulated genes included acyl-CoA dehydrogenase short/branched chain (ACADSB) and acyl-CoA synthetase short chain family member 2 (ACSS2), which encode enzymes involved in fatty acid synthesis and oxidation54. Genes downregulated by elevated CO2 included gamma-butyretaine hydroxlase 1 (BBOX 1), which catalyzes synthesis of L-carnitine, an essential co-factor in beta-oxidation55; kynurenine 3-monooxygenase (KMO), an outer mitochondrial membrane protein that hydroxylates tryptophan to form kynurenine56; BCL2 interacting protein 3 (BNIP3), a BH3 domain protein with pro-apoptotic activity57; and mitochondrial assembly of ribosomal large subunit 1 (MALSU1), an inhibitor of translation at the mitochondrial ribosome58.

We previously reported that elevated CO2 inhibits expression of antimicrobial peptide genes and suppresses antibacterial host defense in Drosophila59, suggesting that the immunosuppressive effect of hypercapnia is evolutionarily conserved. Using a genome-wide RNAi screen, we identified a small number of genes whose expression is required for CO2-induced immunosuppression in Drosophila cells, and which are conserved in mammalian systems60. Flies deficient in of one these genes, a zinc finger homeodomain transcription factor known as zfh2, were protected from CO2-induced mortality associated with bacterial infection60. This opens up the opportunity to test whether orthologues of zfh2 and other genes identified in the Drosophila screen mediate hypercapnic immunosuppression in mice and ultimately in humans.",

In addition, the suppressive effect of elevated CO2 on immune gene expression in the airway epithelium, along with similar effects on immune cells, suggest a reason why severe COPD and other lung disease associated with hypercapnia all carry a high risk of pulmonary infection. Bacterial and viral infections are a principal cause of acute COPD exacerbations61\u201364, which are linked to the need for hospitalization and to mortality65,66. Thus, CO2-induced alterations in airway epithelial gene expression may underlie the increase in mortality associated with hypercapnia in advanced COPD, as well as community-acquired pneumonia9, adenoviral lung infections10 and cystic fibrosis11. It is notable in this regard that reducing hypercapnia with noninvasive ventilatory support has been shown to decrease hospital readmissions and mortality in patients with severe COPD67,68. Further investigation of the molecular mechanisms and mediators of CO2 effects on gene expression may reveal targets for pharmacologic intervention to prevent hypercapnic immune suppression in patients with advanced respiratory disease.",

Ontology groups were generated using inbuilt GenomeData, matching the annotated genes with pre-defined processes and intracellular functions. Two approaches were used for analysis of genome wide expression changes: unbiased measurements of intra-network gene expression and fold-change ranked segmentation. Unbiased intra-network changes were assessed for cellular processes that contained at least five genes in the post-screen data. Mean-fold change, the variance of the fold-change, and Pearson correlation of expression were measured for each process. Intra-network heterogeneity of relative expression was measured by calculating the standard deviation of the relative expression for genes within any given ontological process. For instance, if a gene was classified as belonging to both \u201cNucleosome Assembly\u201d and \u201cSignal Transduction\u201d, it was assigned to both groups and a connection between these processes was indicated. To further understand the impact of hypercapnia-induced differential gene expression, cluster domains of GO biological processes containing 5 or more genes and with at least 4 connections were also generated using Mathematica\u00ae v11.2. These processes were broadly grouped based on gene function and by their connections.",
