            "text": "Microbiological quality control for laboratory animals, composed of biosecurity and health surveillance, is essential to guard against the research complications and public health dangers that have been associated with adventitious infections. Laboratory animal biosecurity consists of all measures taken to prevent, contain, and eradicate adventitious infections. To institute an effective biosecurity program, one must understand the chain of infection, including the environmental and animal reservoirs, the sources of infection\u2014such as wild rodents, supplies, people, and biological materials\u2014and the modes of transmission. Based on the sources of infection, risk factors are defined and controlled. A pest control program is put in place; supplies are disinfected by physical or chemical processes; air and water are filtered; personnel don gowns; and biological materials are screened for viral contamination by rodent antibody production tests, in vitro virus isolation, or PCR (polymerase chain reaction). Should an adventitious infection occur, control and eradication are most reliably achieved by depopulation and disinfection, followed by repopulation with SPF replacements or rederived descendants of the infected colony. When this approach is not feasible, however, other control measures such as a breeding moratorium, chemotherapy, or vaccination may be attempted, although these have limited applicability and are risky. In all cases, steps should be taken to ensure that the likely sources of infection and associated risk factors are controlled or eliminated.",

            "text": "Because even the most rigorous biosecurity cannot guarantee that adventitious infections won't occur, health surveillance, including laboratory methods to detect inapparent infections and identify specific etiologic agents, should be performed routinely on both breeding and research colonies. To develop a microbiological monitoring program that is both effective and practical, choices need to be made regarding the agents for which to screen, the type and number of animals to be sampled, and the sampling frequency. Program implementation is accomplished by systematically recording these choices and incorporating them into testing schedules. Although the primary methodologies for detection of parasites, bacteria, and viruses are direct gross and microscopic examination, cultural isolation, and serology, respectively, a combination of methodologies is frequently employed to make a definitive diagnosis. The newest of these methodologies, molecular testing by PCR (see p. 378), has made direct detection of viruses and other fastidious microorganisms in clinical specimens practical. Because no laboratory assay is completely accurate, it cannot be emphasized enough that all unexpected positive findings must be confirmed by testing additional samples and by using alternative assays and diagnostic methodologies to corroborate primary test results.",

            "text": "It has been amply documented that adventitious infections of laboratory animals with certain microorganisms can interfere with research. Infections may result in clinical disease and pathological changes, especially in perinatal and immunodeficient animals (Barthold et al., 1985; Gaertner et al., 1989; Jacoby et al., 1987; Schoeb et al., 1986; Waggie et al., 1981; Walzer et al., 1989; Weir et al., 1988). Although infections of postweaning, immunocompetent animals are often subclinical, they can lead to contamination of biological materials and abnormal responses to experimental treatments (Bonnard et al., 1976; McKisic et al., 1993; Peck et al., 1983; Riley et al., 1960; Rowe et al., 1962). Furthermore, some microorganisms indigenous to laboratory animal species are zoonotic agents that have caused disease in people (Anderson et al., 1983; Deibel et al., 1975; Hjelle et al., 1994; Lee and Johnson, 1982; Lewis et al., 1965). It is therefore essential for laboratory animal breeders and users alike to implement and maintain a microbiological quality control program that includes strict biosecurity and comprehensive microbiological, or health, surveillance (Fox and Loew, 1983; Jacoby and Lindsey, 1997; Small, 1984; Wagner et al., 1991; Weisbroth et al., 1998). Both aspects of quality assurance will be reviewed in this chapter. Although microbiological quality control for rodents will be emphasized, the concepts considered are applicable to laboratory animals in general.",

The reservoir, or ecological niche, of a microorganism can be an animal species or the environment (Brachman, 1996). For example, the reservoir for lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) in the wild is the mouse (Lehmann-Grube, 1982), whereas Listeria monocytogenes is found in various avian and mammalian species as well as throughout the environment (Broome et al., 1998). The source of an organism for transmission to a susceptible host is not necessarily the same as its reservoir. The source of L. monocytogenes for an SPF colony might be food or bedding that was contaminated by carrier animals or the environment. The distinction between reservoir and source is important in the case of laboratory animal biosecurity because, in general, it is more practical to eliminate or control a pathogen's source than its reservoir.",

Contact transmission is vertical when it takes place in utero or at birth, or horizontal if it occurs postpartum through the transfer of droplets or by intimate contact, as exemplified by venereal diseases. Fomite transmission can be airborne or by way of common vehicles such as food, water, and bedding. Airborne transmission refers to the spread of contaminated droplet nuclei (i.e., the residue of dried droplets) or dust for a distance of more than several feet (Brachman, 1996). A vector is an animal, typically an arthropod, involved in the spread of infection. Vectors can be biological, that is, essential to the life cycle of the pathogenic organism, or mechanical (Brachman, 1996; Cohen, 1998; Prince et al., 1991; Waggie et al., 1994).",

            "text": "Given that most pathogens are obligate parasites with a limited host range, it stands to reason that wild and domestic rodents are the principal reservoir of adventitious infection for laboratory rodents. Most rodent pathogens are transmitted efficiently by direct animal-to-animal contact (Parker and Reynolds, 1968; Shek et al., 1998; Thigpen et al., 1989; Yang et al., 1995). An exception is lactate dehydrogenase\u2013elevating virus (LDV), which is not readily transmitted from mouse to mouse by natural means, even though it causes a persistent viremia and is excreted in large amounts (Brinton, 1982). In the laboratory, LDV appears to be transmitted mainly by parenteral injection of mice with contaminated biological materials. In this regard, it is noteworthy that LDV is among the most common contaminants of tumors maintained by passage in mice (Collins and Parker, 1972; Nicklas et al., 1993; Riley, 1974). Because contact transmission is usually horizontal, the majority of rodent pathogens can be eliminated through derivation by cesarean section or embryo transfer. Vertical transmission, however, is common for a few agents, such as LCMV in mice (Lehmann-Grube, 1982) and cytomegalovirus in guinea pigs (Choi and Hsiung, 1978).",

Pest control services are best provided by a reputable and licensed commercial vendor. Animal facilities should be constructed and maintained so that potential nest areas and routes of ingress or egress are not present. All holes and cracks in the facility should be sealed. Trapping devices should be used to detect and eliminate loose rodents. Those that are captured alive should be identified as to species, handled as if they were infected, anesthetized, and bled for serology prior to euthanasia.

The accuracy of test results also depends on samples being appropriate for the diagnostic methodology. Animals sampled for serology need to be immunocompetent and given sufficient time to seroconvert (Parker and Reynolds, 1968; Peters and Collins, 1983; Smith, 1983a). In the case of pathology, bacteriology, and parasitology, it is helpful to sample animals of multiple ages, because the prevalence of infection with some bacteria and parasites is age-dependent. For instance, enteric protozoa are readily observed in weanlings but not in older rodents. Conversely, because of a long life cycle, patent infections with the mouse pinworm Aspicularis tetraptera are most often found in adolescent rather than weanling mice (Wescott, 1982).",

In contrast to chemical disinfection, these methods do not leave a residue or by-products that may be toxic for or cause physiologic changes in animals (Hermann et al., 1982). Raw materials used in the preparation of animal feed and bedding frequently have a high bacterial count. The heating of food to 75\u201380\u00b0C during pelleting substantially reduces the bacterial count but is not sufficient to inactivate thermostable pathogens. In addition, food and bedding may become recontaminated after processing (Clarke et al., 1977). Therefore, they should be sterilized or pasteurized for gnotobiotic or SPF rodent colonies, respectively. As mentioned, this has traditionally been accomplished by autoclaving (i.e., saturated steam heat) or gamma irradiation. In comparison with gamma irradiation, autoclaving is less expensive but causes a greater reduction in the nutritional value of food (Ferrando et al., 1981). Another drawback of autoclaving is the difficulty in achieving uniform steam penetration and temperature throughout a load (Small, 1983). Presterilization vacuum cycles help preserve the nutritional value of food by promoting rapid and uniform steam penetration, which allows autoclave times to be kept short (Foster et al., 1964; Maerki et al., 1989).",

Although ionizing irradiation has a variety of physical and biochemical effects, it mainly renders microorganisms nonviable by causing breakage in their nucleic acid (Silverman, 1991). Ultraviolet (UV) radiation (210\u2013328 nm), which does not possess sufficient energy to cause ionization, also inactivates microorganisms by damaging their DNA but does not cause DNA breakage. Instead, UV irradiation produces thymine and other pyrimidine dimers. As one might expect, the bactericidal activity of UV irradiation is maximal near the peak of DNA absorption, which is 260 nm (Russell, 1991). Gamma radiation passes through solid objects; by contrast, UV radiation does not and therefore is effective only for disinfection of surfaces and drinking water. UV inactivation of microbes in drinking water is reduced as the UV-light source loses intensity or becomes dirty and by the presence of particles and dissolved organics in the water (Sobsey, 1989). Nonetheless, UV irradiation is an attractive option for water disinfection because it is virucidal and, in contrast to chlorination, does not convert organic precursors into potentially carcinogenic trihalomethanes (Hood, 1995).",

Phenolics and quaternary ammonium compounds, which disrupt lipid membranes, are more potent against lipophilic, enveloped viruses than against hydrophilic, nonenveloped viruses. Oxidants attack all organic compounds and thus inactivate hydrophilic as well as lipophilic viruses (Klein and DeForest, 1983; Prince et al., 1991). A disinfection scale for all microbial taxons likely to be encountered in laboratory animals, derived from one proposed by Prince et al. (1991) is presented in Table V\n. In brief, this scale restates the generalization made at the beginning of this section that enveloped viruses and vegetative bacteria are considerably easier to inactivate than are nonenveloped viruses, bacterial endospores, and free-living parasite stages. For the most part, a disinfectant that has been shown to inactivate microorganisms of a particular susceptibility group will inactivate infectious agents in more susceptible groups.

Upon colonizing surfaces, bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa are notorious for forming biofilms, i.e., large clumps of bacteria surrounded in slime that resist chemical disinfectants (Potera, 1996). It is therefore crucial that soiled surfaces be sanitized before being disinfected in order to reduce chemical demand and to ensure that microorganisms are adequately exposed to disinfectant. Biofilms, which are likely to accumulate in water systems, can reportedly be removed by treatment with H2O2 or alkaline peroxide (Klein and DeForest, 1983; Kramer, 1992).",

Recent ectromelia virus outbreaks have been linked to contaminated serum (Dick et al., 1996; Lipman et al., 1999). The viral contamination rate is reportedly highest for transplantable tumors passaged in vivo, whereas that for cells grown in culture is comparatively low (Collins and Parker, 1972; Nicklas et al., 1993). Failing to screen biological materials for rodent viruses can also have public health consequences, because LCMV has been a relatively prevalent contaminant of cell lines (Bhatt et al., 1986a; Lewis et al., 1965; Simon et al., 1982). Hence, biological materials should be tested for rodent viruses and, additionally, for extraneous bacteria, fungi, and mycoplasma before being inoculated into SPF rodents. Surveillance for rodent viral contaminants has traditionally been carried out by the mouse and rat antibody production (MAP and RAP) tests and by other in vivo and cultural isolation techniques (Lussier, 1991; Smith, 1986a; Waggie et al., 1994; Weisbroth et al., 1998). Investigators, though, may unwisely avoid rodent antibody production testing because of the time and expense involved. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays for viruses provide an accurate, rapid, and less costly alternative to MAP testing (Riley et al., 1999).",

In many institutions, visitors are permitted to enter animal facilities only if they have not had recent contact with laboratory animals.

These and other valuable mutant strains are often difficult to replace. In such instances, derivation by cesarean section or by embryo transfer is considered the most dependable process for eliminating pathogens that are not vertically transmitted. Another option applied to nonpersistent infections of immuncompetent hosts with enveloped viruses (e.g., Sendai virus and SDAV) is to break the cycle of infection by instituting a 6 to 8 week moratorium on breeding and on the introduction of susceptible animals (Bhatt and Jacoby, 1985). During this period, it is expected that all animals in the colony will recover from infection and stop shedding virus and that the excreted virus will quickly become noninfectious. A time-efficient alternative to a breeding moratorium is to start a new colony with seropositive, noncontagious breeders (Brammer et al., 1993). One should exercise caution when attempting to break the cycle of infection in a transgenic colony, because of the possibility that genetic modification has made the transgenic strain immunodeficient. Determining whether the viral infection has been eradicated is best accomplished by serologic surveillance of sentinels instead of the colony offspring that may have maternal antibodies.",

It is difficult to achieve eradication when the etiologic agent is stable outside of the host, because infection is likely to recur once chemotherapy has ended. On the other hand, endoparasitic infections of rodents have been eradicated by utilizing microisolation cages to prevent reinfection in combination with the highly potent anthelminthics ivermectin or fenbendazole (Flynn et al., 1999; Wescott et al., 1976). Antibiotic treatments have been shown to eliminate infections with bacteria that do not survive for long ex vivo, including Pasteurella pneumotropica (Goelz et al., 1996) and Helicobacter hepaticus (Foltz et al., 1996; Russell et al., 1995).

Mice have been vaccinated with vaccinia virus to control ectromelia (i.e., mousepox) virus outbreaks (Bhatt et al., 1981; Bhatt and Jacoby, 1987). Sendai virus and Bordetella bronchiseptica vaccines have been administered to mice (Eaton et al., 1982; Kimura et al., 1979) and guinea pigs (Ganaway et al., 1965; Nikkels and Mullink, 1999), respectively, to prevent the pneumonia caused by active infections. The principal drawbacks of vaccination are similar to those of chemotherapy in that vaccination must be continued until the sources of infection have been controlled, and routine vaccination of large production colonies is impractical. Vaccination may not be effective for every individual animal. In addition, vaccination may lessen morbidity but still not prevent infection and the resultant detrimental effects on host physiology. Serologic surveillance after vaccination can be problematic if it is not possible to distinguish antibodies to the vaccine from those formed in response to infection with the pathogen.",

Microscopic examination of skin scrapings may be necessary to detect mites, such as Demodex and Notoedres, which burrow into the epidermis (Weisbroth, 1979a; Wescott, 1982). It has been reported that fur mites can be found in a higher percentage of mice by microscopic examination of adhesive tape applied to the dorsal fur than by checking the skin or skin scrapings (West et al., 1992). The use of a pelt digestion method is also effective (Owen, 1972). Infections with enteric protozoa are diagnosed by examining wet mounts of mucosal scrapings of the small and large intestines. This is typically done with a phase-contrast microscope, which makes it possible to see unstained microorganisms (Brock, 1970; Weisbroth et al., 1996). Fecal flotation has been shown to be superior to intestinal wet mounts and histology for demonstrating coccidia in rabbits (Weisbroth et al., 1996). Helminth ova are also detected by fecal flotation and by the perianal tape test in the case of pinworms belonging to genus Syphacia, but direct examination of the gastrointestinal tract for adult helminths is most reliable (Huerkamp, 1993; West et al., 1992).",

To mitigate this problem, specimens are cultured with selective media that contain additives, such as dyes or antibiotics, to inhibit the growth of certain microorganisms. MacConkey's agar, for example, contains crystal violet and bile salts that selectively inhibit the growth of gram-positive bacteria, while allowing most gram-negative bacteria to grow (Forbes et al., 1998). Media for the isolation of Helicobacter from fecal or intestinal specimens contain a mixture of antibiotics to selectively inhibit the growth of the intestinal microflora (Fox et al., 1999). Overgrowth can be further reduced by culturing sites that normally do not possess a microflora to obscure invasive bacteria. Tracheal cultures from Bordetella bronchiseptica\u2013infected animals contain few extraneous bacteria, making it easier to view B. bronchiseptica colonies. Corynebacterium kutscheri is most reliably isolated from the submaxillary lymph nodes of infected rats (Brownstein et al., 1985). Enrichment media are used to encourage the growth of particular bacteria, which are at low concentration in a specimen containing many microorganisms. Selenite broth is an enrichment medium that is used to recover salmonellas from feces or the intestinal tract (Orcutt, 1980). Media are categorized as differential when they allow colonies to be morphologically differentiated based on metabolic characteristics. On MacConkey's agar, lactose-fermenting bacteria produce pink to red colonies whereas colonies of non-lactose fermenters remain colorless (Forbes et al., 1998). Cultures are usually incubated aerobically at 35\u00b0\u201337\u00b0C because the majority of clinically important bacteria are facultative anaerobes that will grow under these conditions, whereas the strict anaerobes that constitute the autochthonous microflora will not. A few fastidious bacteria require special growth conditions. Mycoplasmas require media supplemented with serum as a source of cholesterol and an atmosphere with additional CO2 because they are capnophilic (Davidson et al., 1981; Freundt, 1983; Orcutt, 1980). Campylobacter and Helicobacter species must be cultivated in a microaerophilic environment (Fox et al., 1999; Meanger and Marshall, 1989). Clostridium piliforme can be grown in embryonated chicken eggs and mammalian cell culture, but to date not with artificial, cell-free media (Riley et al., 1994).",

Most viruses have a limited host range; i.e., they infect certain animal species but not others. In an animal host, viruses infect discrete populations of cells, tissues, and organs; this is known as the viral tropism. Sendai virus is referred to as pneumotropic, to indicate that it principally replicates in the lung (Brownstein, 1986). The reoviruses are described as pantropic because they replicate in many host tissues and organs (Tyler and Fields, 1986).",

Most cell culture is done with continuous cell lines that have the potential to divide indefinitely (Hawkes, 1979; Landry and Hsiung, 1992). However, primary cell cultures enzymatically dispersed directly from animal tissues (Greenlee et al., 1982) and explant cultures consisting of tissue fragments (Paturzo et al., 1987; Smith and Paturzo, 1988) are still used to isolate viruses that cannot otherwise be grown in vitro. To isolate a range of viruses, cell cultures of several types, often including primary cells as well as continuous cell lines, need to be inoculated to accommodate the variety of viral host ranges and tissue tropisms (Landry and Hsiung, 1992). By contrast, one or two host cell types might suffice when the goal is to isolate a single virus. Virus infection of cultured cells may induce degenerative changes, such as syncytial cell formation or cell lysis, that are referred to as cytopathic effects, or CPE. These changes may be characteristic and aid in identification of the infecting agent. Other viruses may produce effects that are not distinctive, or they may be noncytopathic (Hawkes, 1979; Landry and Hsiung, 1992). In these instances, evidence of virus replication can be obtained by alternative methods such as hemadsorption, for viruses like Sendai that agglutinate red blood cells (Chanock, 1979), or immunofluorescence with virus-specific antibodies (Smith, 1986a). When available, electron microscopy can be a rapid way of observing the morphology of a virus isolate (Allen et al., 1981; Jonas et al., 1969; Vonderfecht et al., 1988; Wallace et al., 1981). Serologic methods can be combined with electron microscopy for virus identification (Doane, 1992).",

            "text": "The sensitivity of virus isolation in vivo is enhanced by using multiple routes of inoculation to accommodate the variety of viral tropisms (Parker and Reynolds, 1968). Following inoculation with a biological specimen, animals are observed daily for disease and mortality. Morbidity can usually be increased by inoculating immunologically immature neonatal animals (Barthold et al., 1982; Jacoby et al., 1987), immunodeficient hosts such as nude mice (Barthold et al., 1985; Gaertner et al., 1989; Weir et al., 1988), or laboratory animal strains for which a particular viral infection is more pathogenic (Brownstein et al., 1981; Parker et al., 1978). A notable exception occurs when the viral disease is immune-mediated, as exemplified by LCMV infection of mice. Following intracranial inoculation of LCMV, immunocompetent adult mice develop lymphocytic choriomeningitis, whereas T lymphocyte\u2013deficient mice do not (Cole and Nathanson, 1974). Morbidity is not a reliable indicator, because viral infections of immunocompetent, postweaning animals are often asymptomatic. Moreover, certain laboratory animal viruses are nonpathogenic, even in neonatal and immunodeficient hosts (Jacoby et al., 1996). A more dependable method for determining whether an animal has been infected with a virus is serology for virus-specific antibodies. This is the basis of the MAP and RAP tests, alluded to above, for detection of murine viruses in biological specimens (Collins and Parker, 1972; Nicklas et al., 1993). Rodent antibody production tests are accurate and comprehensive because mice and rats, as natural hosts, are highly susceptible to infection with field as well as laboratory strains of murine viruses and because serologic assays are sensitive and specific. The MAP test is recommended by regulatory agencies worldwide for detecting murine viruses in rodent-based biological products for use in humans.",

To confirm that elevated LDH activity is due to an infectious virus, sera from test article-inoculated mice are passaged into additional SPF mice. Detection of significantly elevated LDH activity in serum or plasma from the passage mice corroborates the diagnosis of LDV.

The term solid phase refers to the surface, frequently a glass microscope slide or wells in a plastic microtiter plate, to which an antigen or capture antibody is attached. Heterogeneous indicates that each incubation period is followed by a wash step to separate antigen-antibody complexes bound to the solid phase from unbound antigen or antibody. The wash step also removes interfering substances in a specimen that would compromise the sensitivity or specificity of a corresponding homogeneous assay. Immunofluorescence assay results are read with a fluorescence microscope or fluorometer directly following the final labeled-antibody incubation and wash steps, whereas an additional incubation with substrate is required to develop the results of an enzyme immunoassay. Most substrates are chromogenic, producing a colored product, at a rate proportional to the quantity of enzyme-labeled antigen-antibody complexes that have attached to the solid phase. Color development can be read visually in a qualitative or semiquantitative fashion or with a spectrophotometer to obtain quantitative optical density readings (Chan, 1987; Mahoney and Chernesky, 1999; Rose, 1999; Voller et al., 1982).",

            "text": "In diagnostic and experimental laboratory animal microbiology, the antigen assay methodology to which labeled antibodies are most frequently applied is immunocytochemistry for the identification of microbial antigens in cell cultures or animal tissues (Allen et al., 1981; Brownstein et al., 1981; Cera et al., 1994; Dick et al., 1996; Jacoby et al., 1975; Sundberg et al., 1989; Tanishita et al., 1984; Weir et al., 1986, 1988). Standard specimens for immunocytochemistry are cells or cryostat-cut tissue sections that have been fixed in cold acetone to preserve microbial antigens and make cell membranes permeable to antibodies. When diagnosing a disease retrospectively, however, it may be that only formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues are available. Immunochemical staining of such tissues can be performed, provided that tissue sections are first digested with trypsin to unmask microbial antigens (Brownstein and Barthold, 1982; Elias et al., 1987; Swoveland and Johnson, 1979). Immunocytochemistry methods are classified as direct or indirect (Fig. 3\n). Antibodies to the target microorganism are labeled in the direct method, which therefore has just one antibody incubation step. In the indirect method, the binding of unlabeled antigen-specific antibodies to a specimen is detected by labeled secondary antispecies IgG antibodies, also referred to as antiimmunoglobulins. Protein A and protein G, derived from the cell wall of Staphylococcus aureus and certain streptococci, respectively, bind certain IgG subclasses from various species and thus can sometimes be substituted for species-specific secondary antibodies (DeLellis, 1981; Hrapchak, 1980; Mahoney and Chernesky, 1999). Other popular modifications of the indirect method that amplify signal by increasing the concentration of enzyme bound to the solid phase are the peroxidase\u2013antiperoxidase (PAP) and avidin\u2013biotin\u2013enzyme complex (ABC) techniques (Hsu et al., 1980; Milios and Leong, 1988; Nerurkar et al., 1982). The ABC system makes use of the strong interaction between avidin, an egg-white protein, or streptavidin from Streptomyces avidinii, and the low-molecular-weight vitamin biotin coupled to antibodies and enzymes (Wilchek and Bayer, 1984). The main advantages of the indirect method of immunochemical staining, in comparison with the direct method, are better sensitivity and the ability to perform a variety of tests without having to prepare labeled antigen-specific antibodies for each one. On the other hand, the increased sensitivity of an indirect method may be associated with more background, especially if the labeled secondary antibodies react with immunoglobulins in the tissue section. Background in enzyme immunoassays can also result from endogenous tissue enzymes, such as peroxidases, that nonspecifically catalyze the conversion of substrate to product (DeLellis, 1981).",

However, there have been reports in which a commercial human rotavirus enzyme immunoassay was applied to the diagnosis of mouse rotavirus infections (Jure et al., 1988; Newsome and Coney, 1985). This was possible because the assay targeted a common, inner-capsid antigen shared by all human and animal group A rotaviruses, including those of mice (Greenberg et al., 1983). The assay employed a double antibody sandwich method (Fig. 4\n) in which rotavirus-specific antibodies, coated onto polystyrene beads, captured rotavirus antigens present in a fecal or intestinal specimen. The test sample was followed by HRP-conjugated rotavirus antibodies and substrate to demonstrate antigen binding to the beads. Interestingly, the authors of one study attributed a high prevalence of false-positive results with this assay to a substance (probably a protein) in nonautoclaved feed that nonspecifically bound to the beads and activated the substrate (Jure et al., 1988). An inhibition enzyme immunoassay for the infectious diarrhea of infant rats (IDIR) group B rotavirus (formerly rotavirus-like virus) was developed to evaluate the relevance of such a method for diagnosing group B and other non\u2013group A rotavirus infections in people (Vonderfecht et al., 1985, 1988). The limited sensitivity of antigen\u2013detection solid-phase immunoassays because of background noise explains, in part, why few such assays have been developed for laboratory animal health surveillance.",

This shift has been most pronounced for tests performed directly on clinical specimens, because molecular methods, particularly the PCR, have proven to be substantially more sensitive than their immunoassay counterparts (Wilde et al., 1990). Molecular techniques are better able to differentiate among strains or isolates of microbial species than the traditional strain typing procedures, such as serotyping (Gentsch et al., 1992; Tenover, 1998; Tenover et al., 1994; Ushijima et al., 1992). However, it should be kept in mind that detection of a microbial genomic sequence does not necessarily indicate that infectious microorganisms are present.",

This process, termed nucleic acid hybridization, can also occur between a strand of DNA and a strand of RNA (Cooper, 1997). Hybridization underlies the principal strategies for demonstrating target sequences of microbial DNA or RNA in clinical specimens. These strategies are (1) direct detection with a complementary DNA (cDNA) or cRNA probe and (2) biochemical amplification of a target (or probe) nucleic acid sequence (Tang and Persing, 1999; Tenover, 1998).",

            "text": "The common formats for probe hybridization assays correspond to those employed for immunoassays. They include liquid phase, solid phase, and, in in situ hybridization, the molecular equivalent of immunocytochemistry. Liquid-phase hybridization assays have the advantages of simplicity and speed, but solid-phase assays are also popular in research and clinical laboratories. In a solid-phase assay, a nucleic acid specimen may be bound directly to a nitrocellulose or nylon membrane, or may be separated first by electrophoresis into fragments of different sizes and then blotted onto a membrane. The latter technique is named Southern blotting (after the developer E. M. Southern) if the reporter probe is used to detect DNA or Northern blotting (a play on words) when the probe hybridizes to RNA (Cundiff et al., 1994a; Hsu and Choppin, 1984). Alternatively, target sequences in the specimen can be captured with an unlabeled cDNA probe attached to a microtiter plate well (Goto and Itoh, 1996). Irrespective of the format, a probe hybridization assay involves (1) denaturing the sample nucleic acid; (2) incubating the probe together with the sample under conditions that permit stable probe-target hybrids to form; and (3) detecting the hybrids, usually by measuring the signal emitted by a label (Fig. 5\n). Reporter probes, like antibodies, can be labeled directly or indirectly with radioisotopes, enzymes that act on chromogenic or chemiluminescent substrates, or fluorophores. The specificity of a hybridization assay is a function of the probe sequence and the stringency of the reaction conditions. Probes can be complementary to genomic sequences that identify the group, species, or strain of a microorganism. The usefulness of labeled antibody probes and nucleic acid probes for direct detection of microorganisms in clinical specimens is limited by fixed target quantities in specimens and background due to nonspecific binding of the labeled probes (Mahoney and Chernesky, 1999; Tang and Persing, 1999).",

            "text": "Both the difficulties of isolating fastidious organisms and the sensitivity limitations of labeled probe assays have been bypassed by the recent development of practical and robust technologies for rapid biochemical amplification of target (or probe) nucleic acid sequences entirely in vitro. The best developed and most widely used of these, the PCR (polymerase chain reaction), was the invention for which Kary Mullis was awarded the Nobel Prize for Medicine in 1993 (Mullis, 1990). PCR has become the predominant methodology for demonstrating infectious agents in clinical specimens, including those from laboratory animals, because of its simplicity, speed, sensitivity, and specificity. The emphasis in laboratory animal diagnostics has been to develop PCR assays for viruses (Besselsen et al., 1995a, b; Eiden et al., 1991; Hjelle et al., 1994; Kunita et al., 1992) and for other microorganisms that are difficult to cultivate or are noncultivable (Battles et al., 1995; Beckwith et al., 1997; Cundiff et al., 1994b; Feldman et al., 1999; Goto and Itoh, 1996). Viral PCR assays are replacing cultural isolation and the rodent antibody production tests to screen biological specimens for viral contamination (Chang et al., 1997; Chen and Plagemann, 1997; Riley et al., 1999; Yagami et al., 1995). They are also being used to diagnose laboratory animal infections (Casebolt et al., 1997; Matthaei et al., 1998; Shames et al., 1995; Weisbroth et al., 1999) and to test the environment for sources of adventitious infection (Henderson et al., 1998). It is unlikely, however, that the PCR will replace serology in routine viral surveillance, because many viral infections are short-lived and convalescence of the host is complete, making attempts at virus detection futile regardless of the assay sensitivity.",

The primers determine the sequences that are replicated, because the DNA polymerase used in the PCR can initiate synthesis of a complementary DNA strand only by extending a hybridized primer. The primers chosen for screening assays generally target conserved regions of the microbial genome, such as the parvovirus NS-1 gene (Irving et al., 1993), to minimize the occurrence of false-negative results. For diagnostic PCR assays, on the other hand, specificity is emphasized by selecting primers (and probes) that bind to species- or strain-specific genomic sequences (Battles et al., 1995; Beckwith et al., 1997; Besselsen et al., 1995b; Lu et al., 1995; Shames et al., 1995). Primers for bacterial PCR assays are generally designed from ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene sequences because the rRNA genes have been extensively analyzed, and they contain both conserved and differential sequences (Greisen et al., 1994).",

The sequence between the two primer-binding sites (usually 100\u2013200 base pairs) is amplified exponentially with each PCR cycle, which consists of the three steps illustrated in Fig. 6\n. A PCR assay consists of 30\u201350 cycles, each lasting little more than a minute, that are performed automatically by a programmable heating block called a thermocycler. The automatic, rapid cycling that is the essence of the PCR is possible because the Taq bacterial DNA polymerase used is stable even at the high temperatures used to denature DNA (Cooper, 1997; Tang and Persing, 1999; Tenover, 1998). The PCR can be used to amplify RNA as well as DNA targets, but RNA targets must first be transcribed into cDNA templates by reverse transcriptase (RT). Heat-stable RT allows RT-PCR to be done in a single step. RT-PCR is particularly useful for detection of RNA viruses, e.g., MHV (Casebolt et al., 1997; Homberger et al., 1991; Matthaei et al., 1998; Taylor and Copley, 1993).",

            "text": "Detection and analysis of PCR products are facilitated by the substantial quantity of target DNA that can be amplified from a small number of initial template copies. It is common by PCR to obtain readily detectable quantities of DNA from just a single template copy. In contrast, approximately 100,000 copies of a target nucleic acid sequence are required for detection by blot hybridization (Cooper, 1997). Typically, the products of PCR are separated according to size by electrophoresis on eithidium bromide-stained agarose gels. When a gel is exposed to ultraviolet light, stained DNA fragments appear as fluorescent bands. The sizes of bands are compared with the expected product size to corroborate the specificity of the reaction. A PCR product can be further analyzed by digestion with restriction endonucleases that cleave double-stranded DNA at sites containing specific short nucleotide sequences (Xiao et al., 1992). Following digestion, the number and size of the bands in an electrophoretogram can help verify the identity of a PCR product or characterize the microorganism from which the product was amplified. For example, restriction enzyme analysis has been used to determine the species of Helicobacter detected by PCR with genus-specific primers (Riley et al., 1996a). Other more specific methods for analyzing the PCR product are probe hybridization and DNA sequencing. Microtiter plate-based hybridization assays that utilize colorometric or chemiluminescent detection systems are more practical than conventional blotting methods and can be 10- to 100-fold more sensitive than ethidium bromide\u2013agarose gel electrophoresis (Tang and Persing, 1999). Amplification and hybridization occur concurrently in the fluorogenic 5\u2032-nuclease assay in which an oligonucleotide probe, labeled with both a fluorescent reporter dye and a quencher dye, is included in the PCR reaction mixture. During the extension step of the PCR cycle, the probe, which anneals to the DNA template between the forward and reverse primers, is digested by the exonuclease activity of the Taq polymerase. Once separated from the quencher, the sequence-specific reporter dye signal can be read with a fluorometer (Gibson et al., 1996).",

As was mentioned, it is not uncommon for a PCR assay to be capable of detecting a single copy of target nucleic acid, nor is it unusual for a single copy of template to be amplified 1 million\u2013fold. Therefore, contamination of negative specimens with target DNA from previously amplified templates, positive controls, or positive samples represents a major challenge to use of the PCR for high-throughput testing of clinical specimens. Various measures are taken to prevent cross-contamination, including physical separation of pre-and postamplification procedures, decontamination of work surfaces with chemicals or UV irradiation, and enzymatic digestion or chemical inactivation of amplified template. Conversely, PCR sensitivity can be diminished by specimens such as feces or whole blood that alter the reaction environment or otherwise inhibit target amplification by the Taq polymerase (Wilde et al., 1990). This inhibition can be detected by including an internal assay control or by spiking a duplicate reaction with control template; inhibition is prevented by purifying DNA or RNA from the specimen. Because of the cost of reagents, patent royalties, equipment, and the space needed to separate pre-amplification from postamplification procedures, PCR assays will probably not be used in the immediate future for the diagnosis of infections that are easily demonstrated by conventional methods (Tang and Persing, 1999).",

For viruses that agglutinate red blood cells, the HAI test method (Fig. 7\n), which is predicated on the ability of specific antibodies to inhibit virus-mediated hemagglutination, is still commonly employed as a confirmatory test, because it is simple to perform and can distinguish among antibodies to different species or strains of viruses (Table VI) (Chanock, 1979; Siegl, 1976; Smith et al., 1993b). In the standard HAI test method, each serum sample is titrated in duplicate. One dilution is incubated with virus; the other, without. When hemagglutination is detected in the virus wells but not in the control wells, the sample is considered HAI antibody-negative. If hemagglutination is inhibited in the virus wells, and the control wells show no evidence of hemagglutination, the result is recorded as a titer, which is the reciprocal of the highest serum dilution to inhibit virus-mediated hemagglutination. Significant titers (\u2265 10 or 20, depending on the virus) can also be caused by nonspecific inhibitors of hemagglutination, which can be removed by heat inactivation, enzymatic digestion, and other treatments (Hierholzer et al., 1969). Hemagglutination in the control wells indicates that the serum contains agglutinins that will mask the presence of specific antibodies (Table VII\n).",

In addition, assay results can be read with a spectrophotometer and sent to a computer to be compiled into reports. The steps of the indirect ELISA are depicted in Fig. 8\n(Mahoney and Chernesky, 1999; Voller et al., 1982). To detect nonspecific antibody binding, each sample is simultaneously incubated in an antigen-coated test well and a separate tissue-control well (Fig. 9\n). A sample that gives positive or nonspecific results by ELISA (or another primary assay) should always be retested by an alternative method. A modification of the indirect ELISA method that is particularly useful for evaluating the specificity of a preliminary positive result is Western blotting (Fig. 10\n). It is comparable to the DNA blotting methods alluded to above, except that electrophoresis is used to separate proteins instead of DNA fragments, and the blot is probed with labeled antibody instead of complementary nucleic acid (Mahoney and Chernesky, 1999; Minion et al., 1984; Motzel and Riley, 1991).",

The reason for its rare use for this purpose is that the IFA does not lend itself to automation, and the results must be read manually. The steps of the IFA are similar to those of the indirect ELISA. Briefly, virus-infected cells and uninfected cells are fixed to wells on a glass slide, using cold acetone. The binding of primary antibodies to the solid phase in the IFA is demonstrated with an FITC-labeled antispecies immunoglobulin. After being washed to remove unbound conjugate, slides are covered with buffered mounting medium and examined with a fluorescence microscope. Bright, granular fluorescence is typical of an antibody\u2013virus reaction, whereas diffuse fluorescence is characteristic of nonspecific reactions. The location of fluorescence is also an important factor. In the case of certain DNA viruses, such as the rodent parvoviruses (MVM, KRV, and H-1), strong nuclear fluorescence is characteristic (Cross and Parker, 1972). The ability of IFA to include evaluation of fluorescence morphology and location in the interpretation of reactions is its major advantage over other serologic methods. For the rodent parvoviruses, the IFA detects cross-reacting antibodies better than the standard ELISA because the virus-infected cells that constitute the IFA antigen contain nonstructural viral proteins not found in conventional ELISA antigen consisting of purified viral particles (Smith et al., 1993b). Using recombinant technology, however, it is now possible to produce large quantities of nonstructural viral antigen for ELISA (Riley et al., 1996b). Because recombinant antigens are noninfectious, they are especially appropriate for detecting antibodies to zoonotic viruses such as LCMV (Homberger et al., 1995).",

They are also expected to test negative for antibodies to most exogenous viruses, regardless of pathogenicity. This is because viruses are obligate intracellular parasites that alter the metabolism of the host cells they infect (Oldstone et al., 1982). The bacteria that need to be excluded from an SPF colony depend on the immune status of the animals in it. As mentioned, immunocompetent animals remain healthy and suitable for most research provided they are kept free from infection with a small number of \u201cprimary\u201d pathogens.

A different species might be chosen as a sentinel because it is more likely to become ill following infection than is the principal species.

Because serum antibodies take, on average, 2\u20133 weeks to develop (Parker and Reynolds, 1968; Peters and Collins, 1983; Smith, 1983a), sentinels should be kept in a colony for at least 1 month. Sick animals should be allowed to convalesce and seroconvert before they are tested. In the case of production colonies, retired breeders are recommended because they have had ample time to become infected and seroconvert. For pathology, bacteriology, and parasitology, it is especially important to sample animals of multiple ages, because the prevalence of infection with some bacteria and parasites is age-dependent. Along with, or as an alternative to, sampling multiple age groups, the diagnosis of certain latent infections may be facilitated by testing immunodeficient or immunosuppressed animals. Immunosuppression to provoke Tyzzer's disease is used in the diagnosis of C. piliforme infections (Riley et al., 1994; Waggie et al., 1981).",

In essence, these formulas demonstrate that the sample size required for detecting infection with a certain degree of confidence increases as the prevalence of infection, or positive reactors, decreases. Sample size is also related to the number of animals in a colony in a way that most nonstatisticians find paradoxical. That is, the number of animals that must be sampled to achieve a certain level of confidence increases as the colony size decreases (Dubin and Zietz, 1991). It is important to distinguish between prevalence and incidence. Prevalence is the percentage of positive animals at a point in time in a designated area. Incidence is the percentage of new positives over a designated period.",

According to this formula, if the prevalence of infection or positive reactors is 30%, 8\u201310 animals must be sampled to realize a 95% probability of detecting at least 1 infected or assay-positive animal. To achieve the same level of confidence for a presumed prevalence of 10% requires a sample size of 25\u201330 animals. The correctness of sample sizes calculated with the binomial formula depends on certain assumptions being met\u2014including random spread of infection and a colony size of at least 100 animals\u2014and on the accuracy of the prevalence estimate. Estimates of the prevalence of infection that are conservatively low for animals kept in open cages may be too high for those housed in microisolators. The trend away from open cages toward filter-top microisolation cages may result in smaller effective population sizes and adventitious infections that spread more slowly and have a lower prevalence. As just shown, the calculated sample size for a low prevalence of infection, such as 10%, can be utterly unrealistic. In addition, the relevance of the sampling formulas to sentinel animals kept on pooled, soiled bedding has not been addressed. Thus, the use of statistical formulas to determine sample size is of uncertain value. In practice, the number of animals monitored ends up being a compromise between the desire to achieve a high degree of certainty versus the availability of animals for monitoring and the cost of testing.",

Contamination of gnotobiotic colonies with extraneous bacteria and fungi through physical defects in an isolator or inadequately disinfected supplies is more common than are adventitious viral and parasitological infections. Therefore, bacteriology should be performed more frequently than serology and parasitology on gnotobiotic colonies. Bacteriology should also be performed often on immunodeficient rodents for which many opportunistic bacteria are pathogenic, but it can be done less regularly on immunocompetent SPF colonies because most bacterial contaminants of isolator-, microisolator-, and barrier-reared rodents are not primary pathogens. In barrier rooms where adventitious infections are most frequently caused by viruses, serology should be performed more often than bacteriology and parasitology.",

            "text": "Implementation of health surveillance requires a systematic approach for translating the decisions on agent selection and sampling into a program of consistent and routine testing. The first step in this process is to record the viruses, bacteria, fungi, and parasites for which each species is to be monitored. Then assays for these agents are combined into serology, bacteriology, parasitology, and pathology panels. Serology panels consist of antibody assays identified by method and agent. Bacteriology panels are composed of sampling sites and lists of the primary pathogens and opportunists to be found at these sites. Pathology panels specify the tissues and organs to be examined. Several panels may be defined for a species in order to reflect the frequency with which certain infectious agents have been found. In the case of serology, basic profiles that include commonly found viruses are performed more often than are comprehensive profiles to which rarely detected agents have been added. Next, test protocols are constructed by combining assay panels with the appropriate samples. For example, retired breeders might be selected for serology, whereas parasitology would be performed on weanlings and young adults (Table VIII\n). Finally, testing frequencies are combined with test protocols to form schedule templates (Table IX\n), which are assigned to colonies to create schedules (Table X\n). This may be done manually or by computer. On the dates indicated in the schedule, the number and type of samples designated in the protocol are collected and submitted to a diagnostic laboratory. A submission form that contains the protocol information should be sent with the samples. Result reports should be analyzed and filed in an organized fashion (e.g., according to facility, room, and species).",

In the final step, the DNA polymerase synthesizes copies of the target sequences by extending the primers.",

A suspension of red blood cells is then added. The species of blood cells and the incubation temperature vary according to the virus. If the serum specimen contains antibodies to the viral hemagglutinin, these will coat the virus and prevent it from agglutinating the red blood cells. Nonagglutinated red blood cells appear in the well bottom as a button that streams when the plate is tilted. Conversely, if the sample is HAI antibody-negative, red blood cells do not stream but instead blanket the well bottom, indicating that hemagglutination has occurred.",

For a viral antibody assay, the tissue-control (TC) well is coated with an extract of uninfected cells of the type used to propagate the virus. For a microorganism that is not grown in cell culture, the tissue-control well can be coated with a related but antigenically distinguishable microorganism. For example, the tissue-control well for Mycoplasma pulmonis might be coated with M. arthritidis. Nonspecific binding is discouraged by using special protein solutions for \u201cblocking\u201d wells after the antigen-coating step and as diluents for serum and conjugate. The sample is considered antibody-negative when color development in the antigen (AG) well is minimal. The sample is evaluated as antibody-positive when the intensity of color in the antigen well is moderate to strong, but little or no color develops in the tissue control well. A reaction is nonspecific when moderate to strong color develops in the tissue-control well in addition to the antigen well. Results may be read visually or with a spectrophotometer.",
