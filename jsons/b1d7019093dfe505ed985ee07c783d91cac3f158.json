The recent attempts at creating digital currencies, famously known as cryptocurrencies, and their corresponding platform blockchain were some of these. How and why did they emerge? What do their inventions imply for our future? And why are they important? Sharing economy and memberships (as opposed to ownerships) are other examples of profound changes. Increasing use of shared goods, services like Uber and Airbnb, and the unstoppable trend of membership services like e-newspapers, e-libraries, and music streaming points to one conclusion: the end of the idea of ownership. On the governmental side, we have been observing an increasing inclination toward authoritarian states. Liberalism seems to have failed. People have been losing their trust in economic regimes. My argument in this chapter is that without the 2008 crisis, there would have never been these developments and innovations.",

The security officer, Terry Maker, opened it, which suddenly exploded, injuring his hand. This was the first bomb a serial killer, who wanted to be called Unabomber, started sending to several universities and airports targeting especially academics and business executives. Unabomber, whose ability and intelligence was underestimated in the beginning, was building sophisticated bombs that could not be traceable, leaving false clues to mislead the police. The FBI, who even formed a task force of 150 full-time agents for the bomber, interviewed the families of the victims, investigated hundreds of people to have a clue about the bomber. However, they could not even identify the gender of Unabomber until 1995, seventeen years after the first bomb.",

He was systematically killing or injuring few people in each of his attempts. In his 16 incidences, he was reported to kill three people and injure 23. He was trying to give a message to society in the most violent way possible. Nobody got the message until 1995 when he famously wrote an article and asked the newspapers to publish it. He said he would stop his attacks in full if his article were published but continue sending bombs otherwise. The debate lasted days about publishing a terrorist's article. At last, FBI Director Louis Freeh and Attorney General Janet Reno recommended publishing the article with the hope that somebody would identify him. The article appeared in Washington Post 1 on September 22, 1995, with the title Industrial Society and Our Future. This was the manifesto of the Unabomber against the modern world. It was a well-written 35,000-word essay with very strong arguments. In his article, he claimed that the industrial and technological revolutions had been harming society and leading to social disruption. Technology was a unified system, in which bad parts cannot be separated from good parts. Therefore, he said, scientific research should be stopped, and people should return to wild nature as soon as possible. That was the main idea of his whole message. That's why he hurt so many professors, thinking that they were the main responsible people of this indignity. He wanted to warn society in a brutal way.",

An FBI profiler who analyzed the essay and letters tracked him down. The name of the serial killer was Theodore John Kaczynski, and he was caught and detained in 1996 in his primitive cabin in Lincoln, Montana. He was living in a forest in the most natural way possible. No electricity, no telephones, no water supply. The only tools he had were the ones used for bomb-making. It turned out that Kaczynski was a \"twisted genius\" with an IQ of 167.

Several media keep telling stories, since the crisis, that governments do not behave fair to society and inequality widens. The Spanish television series La Casa De Papel (Money Heist ) centers on central banks' authority on money printing. Eight thieves are trying to steal billions of euros from La F\u00e1brica Nacional de Moneda y Timbre, which is the sole institution with money-printing rights in Spain. The robbers lock themselves in the building and want to stay there as long as possible so they can print an enormous amount of money. When caught, the head of the gang of robbers, the professor, rationalizes the robbery by telling the inspector: \"What we are doing is OK with you when other people do it. In the year 2011, the ECB made e171 billion out of nowhere. Just what we are doing. Only bigger.\" 7 The movie heavily criticizes the capitalist intervention of central banks and compares their action with robbing money. This is the image of central banks in the eyes of the public, and this narrative goes viral.",

            "text": "The assets in the balance sheet of the Federal Reserve increased from $876 billion in July 2007 to $2.2 trillion in November 2008. The balance sheet of the Fed is very similar to normal banks and is composed of three main parts: Assets = Liabilities + Capital. Assets are mainly composed of the securities the Fed buys and the loans it makes to banks. For example, if the Fed buys a government security of a mortgage-backed security from a bank, its assets increase by that amount. These assets are financed by liabilities and capital. Liabilities are mainly the money the Fed pays to the public and institutions. An increase in assets shows that the Fed increases its purchases. The assets of the Federal Reserve Bank were stable in the $700-$800 band for the five years prior to the crisis. The $1.3 trillion increase between 2007 and 2008 stems from the fact that the Federal Reserve purchased some of the troubled (also called toxic) assets of failing financial institutions and injected this money to those institutions. In other words, the Federal Reserve lent (effectively printed) $1.3 trillion worth of money to banks to save them. The balance sheet increase was performed under different alphabet-soup names, such as Term Auction Facility (TAF), Term Securities Lending Facility (TSLF) or Quantitative Easing (QE). The assets of the Federal Reserve peaked at $4.5 trillion in January 2015. The European Central Bank followed the same path, injecting trillions of euros into the market. The global cost of this process was estimated at $5 trillion by the end of 2009 (Skidelsky 2009, 16) .",

            "text": "What is the problem with the existing system? As it is known, the current monetary system is based on fiat money, which is printed and backed by governments. It requires people's full trust in the government because they, willingly or unwillingly, can create an inflation that sweeps away all or part of the people's wealth. Inflation is a secret and powerful weapon of governments to get printed money back. Many countries try to overcome this problem by declaring central banks independent, whose job is nothing but to control inflation. In this way, the central banks do not need to follow the wishes of governing parties, which in general tend to print money, eventually leading to inflation. So, a central bank independency is another way of telling citizens that the government does not try to get the printed money back. Some governments may fulfill their responsibilities, but some do not. Venezuela is a great example of this. The current inflation is around 25,000 percent, and the International Monetary Fund projects that it will be 10,000,000 percent by the end of 2019. 8 It is reported that people in Venezuela pay the bill before they order something in restaurants because it might double after they eat. Therefore, printing excessive amount of money, or inflation, is the biggest problem of the current monetary system. John Maynard Keynes once famously said: \"By a continuing process of inflation, governments can confiscate, secretly and unobserved, an important part of the wealth of their citizens.\" Many people trust their governments, but some may not. Henry Ford said years ago that \"people of the nation do not understand our banking and monetary system, for if they did, there would be a revolution before tomorrow morning.\" It seems that people started understanding the monetary system.",

Even though the original cryptography algorithm dates to the 1970s (Shiller 2019, 9) , it was not publicly accepted and embraced. The first common and publicly recognized digital money was introduced when people lost their confidence in the monetary system. Look at Barry Popik's case, for example (Zweig 2018) . In September 2008, he was left with $35.98 out of his initial investment of $25,000 in Lehman Brothers, when it went bankrupt. However, this did not happen to investors of several other companies that were bailed out. AIG received emergency liquidity; Merrill Lynch was acquired by Bank of America; and Washington Mutual and Bear Stearns were acquired by JP Morgan Chase, all with the help of the U.S. Treasury and the Federal Reserve Bank. The investors of these financial institutions were lucky in being saved by the U.S. government, but Mr. Popik was not. Thousands of people lost their homes and investments, but other people did not because they received aid. Those were the days when several financial institutions received rescue funds from the government under different names, but Lehman did not. It filed for the largest bankruptcy in American history. Ben Bernanke defends letting Lehman fail in his latest book Firefighting: \"It was a loosely regulated, heavily overleveraged, deeply interconnected nonbank, with too much exposure to the real estate market and too much dangerously runnable short-term financing. What made the story of Lehman different was that it ended in a disaster\" (Bernanke et al. 2019, 59) . However, Americans were not convinced that these institutions deserved this. And Bernanke accepts that the Lehman collapse is \"probably least understood\" by the public. People were hearing the stories about Goldman Sachs, which received $10 billion from the government and paid $14 million in taxes for 2008 (compared with $6 billion in 2007) and paid out more than $11 billion in compensation to its employees (Reuters 2009 ). 9 Henry Paulson, who headed the U.S. Treasury until 2009, was criticized for his bailout plan because he was a Goldman Sachs employee in 2006. Critics saw this as a conflict of interest. As Wall Street Journal reporter Jason Zweig wrote: \"Bad things happened to good people, and good things happened to bad people.\" Mr. Popik is still struggling in the courthouse to get his money back, suing over the wrongdoings of managers. However, as of 2018, no top manager is known to have been charged with any bad practices. After millions of people lost their jobs, governments worldwide handpicked the institutions they rescued. As Acemoglu and Robinson rightfully argue in their book: \"This feeling [that the economy is rigged and political system is complicit] was certainly strengthened by the financial crisis and its aftermath, which witnessed government bailouts of banks \u2026 while poor households facing bankruptcy received little help\" (Acemoglu and Robinson 2019, 483) .",

It has never reached pre-crisis levels since then. Moreover, in 2019, only 1 in 5 Americans agree that the system is working for them. 10 There is obviously a low level of confidence in the system.

Nakamoto said in one of his white papers: \"The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that's required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust.\" 11 Bitcoin was created to gain this trust, claiming to be closed to government interventions. We will see whether it will prove to be more trustworthy than other currencies, but one thing is for sure: People are searching for better and more-just monetary systems. Even though there are many doubts about its financial viability and valuation, the value of this unknown man's money has skyrocketed from 5 cents to $19,800 in only eight years, almost 400 percent average annual return. As of March 2020, its value was swinging around $5200. No matter what its value is, Bitcoin started an era open to paradigm changes in the monetary system. It and mostly its underlying technology sparked a silent revolution. It is getting public recognition in different financial platforms. CME Group (Chicago Mercantile Exchange & Chicago Board of Trade) started trading Bitcoin futures on December 18, 2017. 12 Inspired by Bitcoin, several software developers created different currencies working on blockchain technology. As of November 2019, more than 2300 cryptocurrencies are in circulation, 13 and this number is even bigger than the total number of global fiat currencies in circulation. Not only did the total number of cryptocurrencies increase every day, but new decentralized platforms working on blockchain, started to emerge. Ethereum is one of these. As its creator, Vitalik Buterin, points out, it \"moves far beyond just currency.\" 14 I am not going to go into the technical details, but the common point of all platforms working on blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies is their decentralization property, their being rebellious to the ongoing centralized monetary and data authorities.",

You become a member by paying an annual fee, which is around $50, and borrow anything you need, up to five items each time. You borrow the item for three to seven days and bring it back. If you do not return the article on time, you pay a late fee. In this way, you do not need to keep a bike trailer, a cargo box for car roof or heavy-duty drills in your garage. How does it sound? This tool library, which was started in 2012, exists in Toronto, Canada, and its name is Sharing Depot. Any tool, unwanted or unneeded from any household in Toronto, finds its way here for rental. The store has over 2200 members, and owners say they have loaned at least 25,000 tools to the community. 17 Eleven years after the crisis, in 2019, one of the very few tool libraries in United States, called Chicago Tool Library, was launched in Chicago as a nonprofit organization. 18 Besides lending tools and machines they offer training, programming, and workshops. They use honor system for the membership. You pay what you can (but they suggest $1 for every $1000 of annual income). You do not need to prove your income. In January 2020, I interviewed Tessa Vierk, cofounder of Chicago Tool Library, asking the reasons behind the launch of the organization. Among other things, she mentions, \"Increase in income inequality\" and \"growing concerns about the environment and consumption\" as the outstanding reasons behind the wave of tool libraries.",

According to Piketty et al.'s (2018) calculations, the pretax income of the bottom 50 percent of American adults has stagnated from $17,500 in 2008 to $16,700 in 2014. When adjusted for inflation this is a $2700 decrease per adult in six years. In accordance with that, their income share has decreased from 13.7 percent in 2008 to 12 percent in 2014. This can be interpreted as follows: At least half of the U.S. population are poorer in 2014 than in 2008. Atif Mian and Amir Sufi confirm the phenomenon from a different perspective: \"During the Great Recession in the United States, the housing bust disproportionately affected low net worth, highly indebted home owners. Indebted home owners bore the first losses associated with the collapse in house prices; as a result, they saw a massive collapse in their net worth\" (Mian and Sufi 2014, 44) . According to their calculations, the net worth of the lowest 20 percent income group plummeted from $33,000 in 2007 to almost $7000 in 2013 (Mian and Sufi 2014, 190) . They lost their 15-year-worth in a couple of years. However, the decline of the average wealth of the richest income group was from $3.2 to $2.9 million, just a 9 percent decrease (Mian and Sufi 2014, 23) . Thus, the crisis hurt the poor far worse than the rich. As a result, heavily affected poor people looked for cheaper ways of making ends meet, and this need opened totally new windows in several industries. The idea of sharing helped.",

Thus, there is a market for a legal transfer of anything from one side to the other. The price is determined in the market, based on supply and demand. This has been the essence of free-trade postulation of capitalism in the past couple of hundred years. Everybody felt obliged to buy goods to use them. Hence, now we have a market for everything, and our houses are full of goods that are not frequently used.

It provides cheaper opportunities to travelers than hotels do. Today, Airbnb provides accommodation opportunities in more than 80,000 cities around the world. The company is now estimated to be worth $38 billion. 20 The release of the first smartphone, iPhone, in 2007 facilitated the spread of sharing economy, which can broadly be defined as \"consumers (or firms) granting each other temporary access to their under-utilized physical assets ('idle capacity'), possibly for money\" (Meelen and Frenken 2015) . Several start-ups followed suit by creating apps that allow people to share their goods. It included shared cars, houses, video games, and movies.

            "text": "The free-market theory, which is core to current capitalism, was prevalent in the second half of the twentieth and the beginning of the twentyfirst century. Milton Friedman was one of the biggest proponents of the theory. Most economists were writing on the virtues of free markets after him, and the wealth of countries was explained by how successfully they adopted the ideology and how they minimized governments' involvement in markets. Dambisa Moyo proposes free-marketsbased tools as a solution to the long-lasting poverty problems all around the world, especially in Africa (see Moyo 2009 ). Individual liberty and freedom of choice in the West mainly stem from this thinking. The idea of being free to choose had become an essential part of economic life. Every individual should be totally free to make decisions about their personal, social, or economic life. This freedom, in turn, required more options. Thus, the number of options in our economic life has given us more options, from cars to houses, health insurance to retirement plans. This process provided more sophisticated loan markets because people's wants never ended. The government was intentionally kept out of the markets because individuals had the freedom and the intelligence to choose with whom to work and trade. Several laws were passed to free the markets from government involvement. Every single financial regulation was either relaxed or repealed for this reason. For example, the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 in the U.S. prohibited banks from using deposits to invest in complex financial instruments like derivatives. This was a kind of government control on the markets, protecting depositors. This act was repealed by the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act in 1999, allowing commercial banks to offer more financial services that might risk depositors' money and to merge with insurance companies. This, in turn, gave way to \"too big to fail\" corporations. Many countries followed suit in the 2000s. In time, the markets got more and more free from government interventions; in return, competition is praised, as it was supposed to act as a tool to regulate the markets (instead of the government). Whoever was doing a bad job would be disqualified by the best practicing banks. However, competition became a vicious cycle. Bad practices induced other bad practices instead of being disqualified. Greedily competing financial institutions found no other solution to get a tiny market share than granting credit to anybody asking for it. The aim was not finding the right customer for the right loan; on the contrary, it was selling as many loans as possible, no matter what consequences it posed for the borrower. Once most banks follow this path, the loan applications were overlooked and most rules were relaxed. A perfect herding behavior occurred and collapsed the system. The aim of a perfect competition did not bring in the desired outcome. Thus, one of the pillars of free-market ideology, the well-praised competition, for the markets.",

They were mostly not held accountable for their bad decisions and actions. It was a single-edged sword: if you did a good job, you would be rewarded; if you screwed up, the government would save you.

Bush's $700 billion rescue plan, which was initially rejected by the House, was eventually approved, conservative Republican Senator Jim Bunning of Kentucky said: \"This massive bailout is not a solution.

In July 2019, in an unprecedented move, he sacked the central bank governor, Murat \u00c7etinkaya, whose four-year term was to end in 2020. Erdogan explained: \"We told him repeatedly to cut interest rates at meetings on the economy. We said that a rate cut would decrease inflation. He did not do what was necessary. We were not on the same page.\" 23 Even though central bank independence has been under attack, it is only Turkey among the major economies that dared to sack a central bank governor. Five months after municipal elections, on August 19, 2019, Erdogan's authoritarian regime sacked elected mayors of three predominantly Kurdish cities-Diyarbakir, Mardin, and Van-on \"terror charges.\" Mayors received 63, 56, and 54 percent of the vote, respectively, in the elections held on March 31, 2019. The government appointed new governors for the offices. Turkey has never been a fully democratic country, but it has never been under this much authoritarian pressure.",

After he came to power in 2008, he took several steps to convert Hungary, a European Union member, to an authoritarian state. Freedom House identified some of those: overhaul of the Constitutional Court, elimination of independent budgetary council and its replacement by one under his party's control, adoption of new election law that favors his party, establishment of a new press authority whose members will be Orb\u00e1n's appointees (Puddington 2017) . Orb\u00e1n defined his new government style as an \"illiberal state\" and discredited Western democracy, which, according to him, \"embodies corruption, sex and violence\" (ibid.). He does not hide his intentions to model his country on China, India, Russia, and Turkey (ibid.) . According to The Economist, Orb\u00e1n's policies constitute a \"direct challenge to the 'fundamental values' of the European project\" (The Economist 2017).",

National emergency acts were declared by U.S. presidents in serious incidents like the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. In President Trump's case, it was invoked to bypass Congress. He was not even responding to a serious event.

They mention a long-term intergenerational change behind authoritarian populism. According to this view, Western culture has been moving toward a more liberal direction in the past couple of decades. The college-educated young generation has demonstrated support for \"post-materialist\" values, which are more liberal in certain topics, such as sexuality, religion, and race. This triggered a reaction in the older generation, who have more authoritative values, feeling like \"strangers in their own land.\" These generational changes reached a \"tipping point\" where traditionalists, whose population is shrinking but active electorate remain a majority, became open to the propositions of the populist and authoritarian leaders who seemingly support their values against social liberals. Norris and Inglehart call this \"silent revolution.\" The theory might be right for populism, that is, the roots of populism might date back to the 1970s or 1980s. Both Rodrik (2018) and Gidron and Hall (2017) confirm this. The former paper shows that the vote share of populist parties has been increasing since the 2000s, while the latter demonstrates that the vote share of rightwing populist parties is on the rise since the 1980s (Fig. 1 in both papers) . Journalist John Judis, the author of the Populist Movement, disagrees with this long-coming trend of populism and differentiates the current populist movement from those in the past. He cites the crisis as a reason behind the increasing populism too and uses the differences between European countries, which were barely hit by the crisis and which did not experience a big economic slump. He says right-wing parties dominated the political arena in the former group of countries and leftwing in the latter (Judis 2016) . According to him, the recent shift to populist authoritarianism stems from the 2008 crisis.",

Big Data algorithms might create digital dictatorships in which all power is concentrated in the hands of a tiny elite.\" According to him, technology favors more authoritarianism practices in the future.

            "text": "If the trend mainly stems from the economic slump, as I claim, it totally depends on the future states of world economies and whether the society's unrest continues. Considering my argument that the 2008 crisis increased the authoritarian tendencies, a plausible question would be whether these tendencies will continue in the future. I think it would depend on the frequency of the future crises. The bad news is that some economists think that the frequency of financial crises has been increasing (Reid et al. 2017 ). Moreover, their duration and impact have also been increasing. This would, in turn, mean that we shall encounter more active governments with increasing frequencies. This would definitely boost the autocratic tendencies. For example, at the time I was finalizing this book in March 2020, coronavirus was posing a serious threat to global economies and every nation was taking extreme measures to prevent possible undesired outcomes of the pandemic. The current development of the measures shows signs of what we experienced in the past: Governments have all the excuses to exaggerate the policies for their favor and do not stop where they have to. This would in turn, as we saw before, increase autocratic tendencies and decrease individual liberties and privacy. The good news is that society is learning how to respond to these autocratic practices. Several academic researchers point out the active need of society for a better future. Raghuram Rajan calls this Third Pillar (the first two pillars are said to be state and market) (Rajan 2019) . MIT professors Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson state this as follows: \"If the state and the elites become too powerful, we end up with the Despotic Leviathan. If they fall behind, we get Absent Leviathan. So we need both state and society running together and neither getting the upper hand\" (Acemoglu and Robinson 2019, 40) . If society gets more involved in how the country is managed, things might be different. A recent Turkish rap song with hashtag #susamam (I can't stay silent) which went viral in September 2019 is a great example of this societal unrest. Twenty Turkish musicians point to violations of the rule of law in Turkey, together with several other problems. However, it takes time for society to get organized, especially in traditionally strongman-loving societies like Turkey.",

It is becoming easier to control the masses by means of apps. This provides governments with a great incentive to control and collaborate with tech companies. The Wall Street Journal reports that 95 percent of young adults on the internet use a Facebook product, and Amazon accounts for 75 percent of electronic book sales. Google absorbed 42.2 percent of online ad spending in 2017 (eMarketer 2017), making $35 billion; Google and Apple provide 99% of mobile phone operating systems, while Apple and Microsoft Corp. supply 95% of desktop operating systems (Ip 2018) . As the companies get bigger and stronger, governments would have more incentives to either control them or collaborate with them to control the masses.",

            "text": "I have been making the claim that the 2008 crisis was the beginning of a new era and the crisis' implications for our lives. However, that is not the end of my argument. I also claim that the crisis led us to rediscover several humane values, which are centuries old. Even though overconfidence, present bias, and envy have been successfully put forward by several types of behavioral research as vices destroying our economic decisions, they had been the fundamental teachings of religion, mythology or humanities. These also happen to be the ideas that old novels were built on. Gary Saul Morson, professor of Slavic Languages at Northwestern University, and Morton Schapiro, professor of economics at the same university, strongly recommend economists to benefit from humanities and old Russian novels, like Anna Karenina by Tolstoy, to improve their understanding of humans. They point out the character Ivan in Dostoevsky's Crime and Punishment book to show how irrationality, which is recently discovered in economics literature, is inherent in human nature (Morson and Schapiro 2017). I am not or won't be claiming that religions or old novels are solutions to our modern problems. What I claim is that the vices and human errors we have been studying in the aftermath of the crisis, under the title behavioral economics, have already been vital parts of previous teachings and culture. Moreover, the methods and nudges to fight with these errors were also heavily discussed in the texts of almost all known religions. We are reverting to our once-ignored values and built-in functions. This might be a remarkable feature of the future. That is, even though the technology has been improving at an enormous speed, and humans seem to be more and more engaged to it, the developments I mentioned shows that we are rediscovering old-school values and concepts. It seems as if the finance industry has been restructuring on more humane values like ethics, moral, and honesty.",
