SARS-CoV-2 seems to have originated from bats and first reports of cases were from Wuhan, Hubei Province in China, suggesting an animal-to-person spread from a live animal market. The virus then spread outside Hubei and subsequently, to the rest of the world via human transmission. Several countries have now reported community spread.

The identification and isolation of a suspected case is the most important step in curbing the spread of COVID-19.

Similarly, various other key definitions have been provided in Interim U.S. Guidance for Risk Assessment and Public Health Management of Healthcare Personnel with Potential Exposure in a Healthcare Setting to Patients with Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) published by the CDC [4]. Awareness was low among all subgroups with the lowest being the non-clinical/administrative staff.
