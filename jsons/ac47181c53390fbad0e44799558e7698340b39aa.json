These organisms are presented in detail in Tables 1-7. Of the ten viruses reported for Viverridae (Table 1) , three were zoonoses of considerable public health significance. These were the SARS coronavirus (SARS CoV) (Guan et al., 2003; Poon et al., 2005) ; HPAI H5N1 (Roberton et al., 2006; Wu et al., 2013 ) and a number of variants of the rabies virus (Enurah et al., 1988a; Wilde et al., 1991; Tremlett et al., 1994; Nel et al., 2005; Susetya et al., 2008; Pfukenyi et al., 2009; Matsumoto et al., 2011) .

A number of reports also describe isolation of enteric bacteria from viverrids. These include Salmonella enterica serovar Glostrup (Falade and Durojaiye, 1976) ; Klebsiella pneumoniae (Enurah et al., 1988b) ; and Plesiomonas shigelloides (Bardon, 1999) , an Escherichia coli with

These include the SARS CoV, for which Masked palm civets were important amplification and transmission hosts in the epidemic of respiratory disease caused by the organism in southern China in 2003 (Guan et al., 2003) . Viverrids also transmit the infective life cycle stage of a number of macroparasites including the Sarcoptid mite, Notoedres cati (Ninomiya et al., 2003) and helminthes Toxocara genettae (Sanmartin et al., 1992) , Ancylostoma sp.

While published data on wildlife farming are scant, the number of individual civets on farms is likely to be large by 2003, 40,000 individual civets were registered on farms in China (Patou et al., 2009) . Another growing industry is the production of civet coffee, where coffee beans are fed to civets and subsequently harvested, undigested, from their faeces. Traditionally collected from the faeces of free-ranging animals in the vicinity of coffee farms, coffee producers are increasingly turning to caged production to satisfy demand for this product, which has the dubious distinction of being the 'world's most expensive coffee' (D'Cruze et al., 2014; Techangamsuwan et al., 2014) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 157, "end": 178, "text": "(Daszak et al., 2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}, {"start": 221, "end": 242, "text": "(Cosson et al., 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 301, "end": 324, "text": "(Roberton et al., 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF125"}, {"start": 436, "end": 454, "text": "(Shi and Hu, 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF140"}, {"start": 589, "end": 615, "text": "(Tolosa and Regassa, 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF153"}, {"start": 626, "end": 659, "text": "(Balakrishnan and Sreedevi, 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 793, "end": 813, "text": "(Patou et al., 2009)", "ref_id": "BIBREF114"}, {"start": 999, "end": 1019, "text": "(Patou et al., 2009)", "ref_id": "BIBREF114"}, {"start": 1452, "end": 1474, "text": "(D'Cruze et al., 2014;", "ref_id": "BIBREF42"}, {"start": 1475, "end": 1503, "text": "Techangamsuwan et al., 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF150"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Significance for human health"}, {"text": "A wide variety of zoonoses have been reported for captive viverrids (refer to 'Country (source)' columns, Tables 1-7), including the very high profile zoonotic virus HPAI H5N1 (Table 1) .
