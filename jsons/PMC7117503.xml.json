            "text": "Bovine viral diarrhea is an important disease of cattle. Acute infection is usually mild and often subclinical, and is resolved with the appearance of neutralizing antibodies. Transplacental infection of the fetus with a noncytopathic BVDV strain during the first trimester of gestation may lead to persistently infected (p.i.), immunotolerant calves. When these animals are superinfected with an antigenically similar cytopathic strain they may suffer of the fatal mucosal disease (Brownlie, 1991). Another fatal outcome of BVDV infection is associated with severe thrombocytopenia and hemorrhagic lesions. Several outbreaks of this syndrome have been reported, essentially in North America but cases have also been reported in Europe (Corapi et al., 1989; Broes et al., 1992; Pellerin et al., 1994).",

The classification of virus types was made according to the host-species that was infected. Pestiviruses are, however, able to cross the species barrier. BVDV can cross-infect cattle, sheep, goats and pigs (Carlsson, 1991; Paton et al., 1992). BDV is an ovine pathogen that occasionally infects pigs (Roehe et al., 1992; Edwards et al., 1995; Vilcek and Belak, 1996). Differentiation between CSFV and other pestiviruses can be accomplished by the use of CSFV-specific monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) but the search for ruminant pestivirus-specific Mabs has failed due to a great antigenic diversity (Edwards et al., 1991).",

Most of the PCR primers that were selected in the 5\u2032UTR recognized the greatest number of pestivirus isolates but failed to differentiate BVDV from other pestiviruses (Ridpath et al., 1993; Vilcek et al., 1994). Specific detection of CSFV by RT-PCR has been described using primers located in the coding part of the genome or by the sequence analysis of the PCR product amplified using primers located in a highly conserved region of the 5\u2032UTR (Katz et al., 1993; Wirz et al., 1993; Hofmann et al., 1994). The gp25, gp48, p54 and p80 regions did also serve as template for BVDV amplification. However, these RT-PCR tests failed to detect all BVDV isolates (Vilcek et al., 1994; Tajima et al., 1995).",

The sequence of the primer used for the cDNA synthesis was conserved between the pestiviruses. This cDNA could thus be used in pestivirus-specific but also BVDV-specific PCR. The primers BE and B2 have already been used by others and were designed to detect all the pestiviruses (Vilcek et al., 1994). Based on the search for genotype-conserved regions, two primer pairs were selected. This allowed us to determine the genotype of the BVDV isolates.",

Our hypothesis is that these were p.i. animals. Indeed, the presence of BVDV in the central nervous system (CNS) has been described and this seems to be an important location for the persistence of BVDV. Primary infection of the CNS most likely occurs across the blood\u2013brain barrier (Fernandez et al., 1989; Hewicker et al., 1990; Hewicker-Trautwein et al., 1992). Other experiments showed that BVDV was found in the CNS of all p.i. animal tested, without causing obvious cellular destruction (W\u00f6hrmann et al., 1992).",
