Accordingly, the 5-ethynyl group would be introduced via Sonogashira reaction of 2'-deoxy-2',2'-difluoro-5-iodouridine with TMSprotected acetylene and subsequent TMS removal. 2'-Deoxy-2',2'-difluoro-5-iodouridine is a literature known compound that has been prepared by glycosylation of 5-iodouracil with an activated derivative of 2'-deoxy-2',2'difluororibose. [2] However, it should also be feasible to obtain 2'-deoxy-2',2'-difluoro-5-iodouridine by electrophilic iodination of 2'-deoxy-2',2'-difluorouridine. The latter compound can be conveniently synthesized from commercially available Gemcitabine by hydrolytic deamination. [3, 4] According to a modified procedure, [3] Gemcitabine (1) was converted to 2'-deoxy-2',2'-difluorouridine (2) using isopentyl nitrite in a mixture of aqueous HCl and 1,4-dioxane with a yield of 68% (Scheme S2). Subsequent electrophilic iodination with iodine and cerium(IV) ammonium nitrate in glacial acetic acid gave 2'-deoxy-2',2'difluoro-5-iodouridine (2b) in a yield of 75%. A Sonogashira reaction of 2b with ethynyltrimethylsilane proceeded to completion according to thin layer chromatography, yet despite extensive purification efforts by silica gel column chromatography using various eluents, it was not possible to separate product 2c from S3 contaminating triethylammonium salts which were carried over into the final step of TMS removal using sodium hydroxide. Following purification, the final product 2'-deoxy-2',2'-difluoro-5-ethynyluridine (3, dF-EdU) was obtained in high purity (>95%) with a yield of 83% over two steps.

[13] The model of HSV1-TK complexed with the ethynyl nucleoside dF-EdU was refined by alternating all along the procedure, rounds of refinement performed with the program PHENIX version 1.8.1 [14] with inspection of electron density maps and manual rebuilding sessions with the graphical program COOT version 0.7. [15] During the refinement of the structure, a residual density was identified in the (F obs -F calc ) electron density map contoured at 2.5\u03c3. For the both subunits A and B of the HSV1-TK homodimer present in the asymmetric unit, this residual density map was located within the nucleoside-binding pocket of HSV1-TK. In each case, the LigandFit program localized the ethynyl nucleoside analog within this residual electron density map.
