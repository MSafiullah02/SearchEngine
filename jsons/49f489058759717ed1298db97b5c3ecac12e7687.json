Verhoef-Verhage\u00b0, A.P. van Boxtel (Utrecht, NL) Introduction: This study is a follow up of the study with urine samples in which the value of the PREVI Isola (bioM\u00e9rieux) system in the routine diagnostic laboratory was analyzed (ECCMID 2009 \u2212 Ab.Nr. 1459. PREVI Isola is a system for automated inoculation and streaking and is able to process any material from patients (liquid format). For urine samples we observed less sub culturing and earlier identification resulting in saving labor time and costs. The aim of this study was to explore the usefulness of the PREVI Isola for more difficult samples as feces and genital swabs. Methods: Feces or genital swabs from 100 different patients were processed manual and by the PREVI Isola. Fecal samples were cultured for Campylobacter (Campylobacter agar), Salmonella and Shigella (XLD-agar) and Yersinia (Yersinia agar). Genital swabs were cultured for aerobic bacteria (blood agar), anaerobic bacteria (anaerobic blood agar), Neisseria gonorrhoeae (GO agar), Gardnerella vaginalis (Gardnerella agar) and for yeasts (Sabouraud agar). For the PREVI Isola both feces (20 ml) and the genital swabs were suspended in 2.5 ml NaCl. Results for fecal samples: All samples could be evaluated. No Salmonella or Shigella was found. In 5 samples a Campylobacter was found but with the PREVI Isola individual, suspected colonies were better distinguished and were seen earlier (after 1 day). High counts of Yersinia were found in 1 sample but only with the PREVI Isola method. Results for genital swabs: In general counts of the different bacteria were somewhat higher (+) with the PREVI Isola method than after manual inoculation. With PREVI Isola individual colonies of the different bacteria were much better distinguished No difference in the isolation of gonococci (3 samples) was seen with both methods. Gardnerella was 1 day earlier seen and much easier distinguished from other bacteria with the PREVI Isola method. Conclusions: As with urine samples PREVI Isola leads to better readable results for the more difficult cultures of feces and genital swabs: individual suspected colonies were better distinguished and counts were higher. Cultures were also often 1 day earlier positive for suspected colonies. Therefore PREVI Isola is very useful in the time consuming culture of especially genital swabs but also for fecal cultures in which identification can be done earlier.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "N.

Osteomyelitis is an inflammation of bone caused by a payogenic organism. Osteomyelitis has been categorized as acute, sub acute or chronic, with the presentation of each type based on the time of disease onset. (Occurrence of infection or injury). Investigation of prevalent factors which produce infection, also, Estimation and comparison of disk diffusion agar method and E-test method in order to determination of antibiotic sensibility about isolated bacteria from osteomyelitis infections are the main purpose of this study. Methods: 131patients with osteomyelitis infection disease were selected for this study during 2008-2009. Samples were collected from bone (14.6%), tissue (7.3%), wound (66.1%), secretions (11.3%) and body fluid (0.7%). In order to microbiologic studies all of samples were cultured according to standard procedure. Some disks with especial antibiotics were chosen for each bacterium during the study of antibiotic sensibility via disk diffusion agar (kirby bauer). Minimum inhibitory concentration via E-test method was used for especial antibiotic and finally compared two antibiogram methods together. Results: Most isolated bacterium was S. aureus (33.6%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (14.5%), and least isolated was Eikenella, Morganella, Showenella (0.8). Conclusion: There are a number of possible pathogens but Staphylococcus aureus is by far the most common, that our study showed same result.

For challenge we used mutant Burkholderia cepacia with dramatically increased capacity of biofilm formation. Methods: Real time PCR, flow cytometry, sandwich ELISA assays, histochemical staining. For intranasal inoculation we used I/St and TBresistant A/Sn inbred mice (~10 g body weight). Results: Comparison of TB-susceptible I/St and TB-resistant A/Sn mice demonstrated that the former are more susceptible to chlamydia, but not burkholderia infection, displaying a significantly shortened survival time following chlamydia challenge. Chlamydia infection: severe lung pathology rapidly developed in I/St, but not in A/Sn mice. In agreement with higher macrophage content in the lungs, significantly more macrophagederived cytokines TNF-a and IL-6 were detected in I/St lung tissue. Burkholderia infection: the increasing virulence of mutant with super ability for biofilm formation was demonstrated both for I/St and A/Sn mice. Both I/St and A/Sn mice are more susceptible to mutant burkholderia infection, displaying a significantly shortened survival time following challenge. It was shown that the mutant strain with increased ability of biofilm formation more virulent for I/St and A/Sn mice than parent burkholderia strain.

We biochemically characterized the Klebsiella pneumoniae SHV-99 enzyme, carrying the amino acid substitution Asp104Gly which, in our knowledge, appeared, in nature, in SHV b-lactamase for the first time. Methods: SHV-99-producing K. pneumoniae KpARG220 strain was isolated from urine of a 35-year-old male in an intensive care unit of the Centre Hospitalo-Universitaire Mustapha Pacha, in Algeria. The blaSHV-99 gene was detected and identified by PCR and sequencing. PCR products were ligated in the SmaI site of the plasmid pBK-CMV, and the recombinant plasmids were electroporated in Escherichia coli DH5alfa. Purification was performed by ion exchange and gel filtration chromatography and kinetic constants were obtained by a computerized microacidimetric method. Results: KpARG220 clinical strain was resistant to penicillins, cephalosporins and monobactams. Although SHV-99-producing transformant (EcDH5alfa-SHV-99) exhibited a b-lactam resistance phenotype similar to the clinical strain in respect to penicillins, it was susceptible to cephalosporins and monobactam. The kinetic parameters showed a lower catalytic efficiency for SHV-99 (kcat, 0.003 to 778 s \u22121 ), when compared with SHV-1 (kcat, 220 to 1937 s \u22121 ). Neither one showed the ability to hydrolyse oxyimino-b-lactams or aztreonam. The mutation Asp104Gly seems to be responsible for the higher Km value for oxyimino-b-lactams found in SHV-99 b-lactamase (Km, 136.0 to 196.0mM); in fact, SHV-99 presents catalytic activity (kcat, 0.5 s \u22121 ) and catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km, 0.003 mM s \u22121 \u00b7s \u22121 ) for aztreonam, whose values were undeterminable for SHV-1. Conclusion: The Asp104 residue is hydrogen bonded to Asn132, and it may therefore stabilize the catalytic Ser130 of the conserved SDN loop. The increase in oxyimino-b-lactams affinity, due to the substitution of an aspartate by glycine, seems to be the first step in the recognition of the side chain of those subtracts, which allows a better accommodation of these antibiotics in the active site of class A b-lactamases.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the MRSA colonization rate among patients admitted to ICU using a new rapid molecular method. Methods: From April through October 2009, a total of 154 patients were screened for MRSA carriage at admittance to ICU. All nasal swabs were analyzed by molecular method (GeneXpert MRSA, Cepheid), able to amplify by real-time PCR the target sequence for MRSA at the SCCmec-orfX junction. Samples were tested also by cultural analysis, plating swabs onto Columbia agar with 5% Sheep Blood and Mannitol Salt Agar (Kyma). Identification and oxacillin testing were performed on suspicious colonies using VITEK2 (bioM\u00e9rieux). Results: Our data with the GeneXpert MRSA showed high sensitivity and specificity of the new molecular method. Among the 154 patients examined for MRSA, 5 had a positive screening result by both, molecular and culture-based method, 19 were identified as MSSA and had a negative result by the molecular test. All samples negative by molecular method were negative also by cultures. Conclusion: GeneXpert MRSA showed high efficiency and efficacy compared with the culture method.

Martinez Martinez (Zagreb, Split, HR; Santander, ES) Objectives: To study the mechanisms of reduced susceptibility to carbapenems in an ESBL producing K. pneumoniae obtained from a patient at the Dubrava University Hospital, Zagreb, Croatia, that was isolated during meropenem therapy. Methods: An ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae (as determined by a double disk assay) was isolated from a blood culture of patient with a cardiac transplant. The patient was treated with meropenem twice in six weeks. Two weeks later K. pneumoniae with reduced suscepeptibility to carbapenems was isolated from an anal swab. MICs were determined by broth microdilution according to CLSI. Modified Hodge Test(MHT) was used to screen for production of carbapenemases. MBL E-test was used to screen for production of metallo-b-lactamases. The presence of blaSHV, blaTEM, blaCTX-M, blaACT-1, blaMIR, blaCMY, blaDHA, blaKPC-1, blaOXA-48, blaIMP and blaVIM was determined by PCR and the obtained amplicons were sequenced. The genetic relatedness of the strains was investigated using PFGE. To study porin content of the strains, outer membrane proteins (OMPs) were extracted and separated by SDS-PAGE. Results: The initial isolate was susceptible to ertapenem (MIC 0.125 mg/L), meropenem (MIC 0.032 mg/l) and imipenem (MIC 0.25 mg/l). MICs of carbapenems for the strain obtained after meropenem treatment were: ertapenem MIC 32 mg/l, meropenem MIC 16 mg/l, and imipenem MIC 8 mg/l. PFGE showed that the two strains were highly related. Both strains were shown to possess blaSHV-11 and blaCTX-M-15/28 genes. MHT was negative in both strains. The PCR reactions with primers specific for Amp-C, KPC and oxacillinase were negative. Both isolates produced an OMP-A like protein. The initial isolate expressed one single porin (OmpK36) while second isolate did not produce any of the two major porins of K. pneumoniae (OmpK35 or OmpK36). Conclusion: K. pneumoniae with decreased carbapenem susceptibility was isolated from a surveillance culture (anal swab) after prolonged meropenem therapy. Since no carbapenemases were produced by the strains, carbapenem resistance is attributed to be due to hyperproduction of CTX-M b-lactamase combined with complete porin loss.

The growth state of PA in CF airways consists of a bacterial biofilm (BF), which differs from that exhibited under conventional susceptibility testing conditions. Within the BF, PA cells are protected from polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) and exhibit a high level of resistance to antimicrobial agents. We examined the in vitro activity of PMNs alone and in combination with amikacin (AMK) against PA BF and compare them to the free-living planktonic (PL) counterparts. Methods: Two clinical PA isolates, a resistant (AMKR, CLSI MIC: 64 mg/l) and a susceptible (AMKS, CLSI MIC: 8 mg/l), derived from two CF patients, were grown by incubation in cation-adjusted Mueller-Hinton broth in 96-well flat-bottomed plastic plates under constant shaking for 48 h at 37\u00baC in order to form BF. PMNs from healthy donors at an effectors to target (E:T) ratio of 1:10 or 1:20 were incubated further for 24 h alone or in combination with 2, 8 or 32 mg/l of AMK.

Flow cytometry allows a rapid analysis of a large number of individual cells using light scattering and fluorescence measurements. Our aim was to develop a flow cytometric protocol to provide an easy, fast and reliable detection of ESBL producers. Methods: Forty clinical strains of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae, classified as positive (n = 20) and negative (n = 20) ESBL producers by phenotypic methods were tested. Strains genetically typed as belonging to the most common ESBLs genotypes (SHV, TEM and CTX-M) were used as controls. The bacterial strains were incubated in Muller-Hinton broth and exposed to cefotaxime and ceftazidime at several concentrations during one and two hours, with and without clavulanic acid (an ESBL-inhibitor). Bacterial suspensions were analysed by flow cytometry after staining during thirty minutes with Bis-(1,3-dibutylbarbituric acid) trimethine oxonol (DIBAC4), a fluorescent dye that penetrates the cell membrane as a result of membrane depolarization. Results: ESBL positive strains showed an increase of the intensity of fluorescence only after incubation with clavulanic acid. The Flow Cytometry method was able to provide a fast (soon after one hour of treatment) and correct classification of the strains. Conclusion: Flow Cytometry proved to be an excellent tool, being accurate and specific for the rapid detection of the most common ESBLs producing bacteria, avoiding the routine delays and high cost. and some of the products had antimicrobial and cytotoxic activities which were higher than the activities of the reactants. We therefore then applied the process to the synthesis of new azoles. Methods: The laccase was obtained from the ligninolytic fungus Pycnoporus cinnabarinus (Pcl). The reaction mixtures were analyzed using an HPLC system with DAD and a RP18 column. For mass spectrometry (MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy the products were isolated by solid phase extraction and dried by lyophilization. The antifungal susceptibility testing was performed with a modified method of the E.Dis. 7.1 [2]. Results: 1-Aminobenzotriazole (1) was used as model substance for the derivatization by Pcl. During laccase-catalyzed transformation of the para-dihydroxylated substrates 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid methyl ester (2a) and 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid ethyl ester (2b) into quinones a nucleophilic attack of the azole occurs, resulting in C-N-coupled heteromolecular products 3a and 3b respectively (yields up to 34%). Their structures were confirmed by MS and NMR analysis. The antifungal activity of 3a,b against Candida species exceeded that of the reactants (Table 1) .

We also found that when a-MSH added to C. albicans under hyphal conditions, the hyphal formation was inhibited. From membrane permeabilization assays we found that there is no significant membrane permeabilization observed on incubation with a-MSH, suggesting that candidacidal activity was not through membrane damage.

To test tigecycline against ESBL producing E coli and MRSA isolates and compare results to those of the E-test programme 2. To carry out antibiotic susceptibility to commonly used antibiotics using the Vitek 2 analyser 3. To carry out MALDI-TOF-MS on the isolates and evaluate its potential in discriminating organisms Methods: A total of 50 MSSA, 50 MRSA, 50 ESBL-producing E. coli and 20 non-ESBL producing E. coli isolates were obtained from Northampton hospital and county, from various specimen types. Presumptive identification of isolates was on chromogenic agar (Oxoid). Confirmation of MRSA and E. coli isolates identification and assessment of antimicrobial susceptibility was by Vitek 2 analysis. Tigecycline E-test was carried out on confirmed ESBL E. coli and MRSA isolates according to manufacturer's instructions (AB Biodisk, Solna, Sweden). For MALDI analysis, organisms were grown on Columbia blood agar plates with 5% horse blood overnight. Direct inoculation technique was carried out by emulsifying a single isolated colony using a 5ml loop onto a MALDI target well. This was left to dry before addition of 0.5 ml of CHCA matrix. MALDI-TOF-MS analysis was carried out using 95% laser power, a maximum of 120 profiles per minute and 5 shots per profile. Results: MSSA was sensitive to most of the antibiotics, with reduced susceptibility to penicillin. MRSA isolates showed increased resistance to antibiotics e.g. ciprofloxacin but were sensitive to vancomycin, teicoplanin and linezolid. ESBL producing-E. coli isolates were 100% sensitive to meropenem and ertapenem, and 97% sensitive to piperacillin/ tazobactam. Tigecycline exhibited 100% potency against 50 MRSA and 50 ESBL producing E. coli isolates with mic values of less than 1 mg/l. Tigecycline results were comparable to those of the E-test programme, e.g. Spain and Canada. The MALDI fingerprints derived from 120 isolates produced rich peaks with high reproducibility. Hierarchical cluster analysis categorized the MALDI spectra precisely into groups according to the antibiotic sensitivity patterns of S. aureus and E. coli isolates as well as b-lactamase production. Conclusion: This study highlighted the problem of antibiotic resistance and potency of tigecycline against resistant isolates.

Molecular identification of the isolates was performed by amplification of nuc gene of S. intermedius. Discrimination between S. pseudintermedius and S. intermedius was done by PCR-RFLP (pta gene digested with either MboI or AluI), being identification confirmed by sequencing of hsp60 or sodA genes. All methicillin-resistant isolates were tested for mecA gene by PCR. SCCmec typing was performed by PCR. The presence of 27 resistance genes was tested by PCR. Leukotoxin and exfoliative toxin genes for S. intermedius (lukS-I/lukF-I and siet, respectively), as well as lukS/lukF-PV, tsst1, eta, etb, hla, hlb, hld, hlg and hlg-2 genes were investigated by PCR. Results: 9 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus pseudintermedius (MRSP were isolated from the 160 studied samples (5.6%), being the only methicillin-resistant CPS species recovered. Comparison of restriction patterns using MboI versus AluI showed the same species identification in all tested isolates. They were typed as SCCmecV (1 isolate), SCCmec III (7 isolates) or non-typable (1 isolate, although the ccrC gene was detected). A multiresistant phenotype (at least 5 families of antibiotics) and the following resistant genes were detected (number of isolates): mecA (9), blaZ (9), ermB (9), tet(K) (7), tet(M) (2), aph(3 ) (9), aac(6 )-aph(2 ) (9), ant(6 ) (9), str (9), dfrA (9), dfrD (2), dfrG (9), dfrK (9), cat(pC221) (1), being ermA, ermC, mph(C), mrsA, msrB, linA , vga(O), tet(L), tet(O), ant(4 ), ant(3'), fexA and cfr genes negative for all MRSP. All isolates harboured the exfoliative toxin gene siet and both leukocidin genes LukS-I and LukF-I, but not the Panton-Valentine leukocidin genes lukS/lukF. Toxin hlg-2 was detected in two MRSP. PCR for other toxin genes were negative. Conclusions: MRSP is a relatively common colonizer of healthy dogs, frequently harbouring a high number of antibiotic resistance genes and some virulence genes what represents public health and treatment concerns. Siet toxic gene was presented in all the isolates and its role in disease requires further study. Results: By spa typing, the majority of MRSA were assigned to t008 (34%) and t041 (25%). Among blood isolates, 9 strains were assigned to t008 and contained SCCmec type IV; 7 were characterized by t041 and SCCmec type I; 9 strains were assigned to 9 different spa types; no strains harboured PVL toxin genes. Of 82 strains isolated from pus/exudate and respiratory tract, 28 were assigned to t008 and harboured SCCmec type IV; 20 were characterized by t041 and contained SCCmec type I; 34 strains were assigned to 21 different spa type and harboured SCCmec types I, II and IV. One strain, isolated from an exudate, assigned to t044, harboured SCCmec type IV and was PVL positive. t008 isolates were more susceptible than those of t041; major differences between t008 and t041 regarded erythromycin (59% vs 89%), gentamycin (40% vs 89%) and rifampicin (3% vs 18%). Clindamycin resistance was inducible in t008 (57% of strains) while in t041 was constitutive (89% of strains). Conclusions: In this study, t041 which was the most common and wellestablished \"old\" spa type in the Italian hospitals has been outnumbered by the \"new\" t008. t008 strains are less resistant to antibiotics than t041. Although t008 isolates resemble the prototype CA-MRSA USA300 they differ from the latter for the lack of the PVL genes and for being multi-drug resistant. Infact, these t008 isolates belong to a well-adapted hospital clone recently emerged in Europe.

Esen (Ankara, TR) Objectives: The epidemiology of S. aureus infections has changed worldwide and MRSA is now frequently found as a community associated (CA) pathogen. The aim of this study was to assess the risks for CA-S. aureus infections. . From the infection control records, we identified two groups of inpatients, one with a new positive MRSA blood culture and one with a new positive MSSA blood culture. We considered the BSI acquired in-hospital if 1) the culture was taken more than 48 hours after admission and 2) if it was taken less than 48 hours but the patient had been hospitalized within the last month. We recorded data pertinent to widely accepted risk factors for Staphylococcus aureus colonization and infection considering events up to 30 days before the positive culture date. We used the electronic pharmacy records to obtain detailed data on intravenous antibiotic use during the month before the culture date. Results: We identified 28 patients with a new NA-MRSA BSI and 32 patients with a new NA-MSSA BSI eligible for further analysis. In univariate analysis, significant differences were noted in age, nursing home residency, presence of chronic wounds, rates of hemodialysis, intubation, enteral feeding receipt and presence of indwelling urinary catheter for more than 24 hours, receipt of at least 1, 2 or 3 antibiotics, qualitative and quantitative use of penicillins, b-lactams and antibiotics as a whole, qualitative use of aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones, and quantitative use of cephalosporins, clindaycin and b-lactam/b-lactamase inhibitors. In 2 models of multivariate analysis, including either quantitative or qualitative use of total antibiotics or individual classes, the only independent predictor of NA-MRSA BSI was the prior receipt of at least 3 antibiotics. No siginificant differences in outcome were noted. Conclusion: From the comparative analysis of these strictly defined patient groups deriving from a highly homogeneous population, we conclude that prior receipt of at least 3 antibiotics was the strongest predictor of a subsequent NA-MRSA BSI, more than individual antibiotic usage or other traditional risk factors for NA-MRSA infection. Between the 1st and the 2nd periods of time the susceptibility of all strains analysed was similar to that one in the 1st period of time.

Background: The presence of antimicrobial compounds in the environment may exert selective pressure on bacteria and contribute to the emergence and dissemination of antimicrobial resistance. Antimicrobial agents are used extensively in hospitals and previous reports of both the parent drug and related metabolites in hospital effluent make it a significant point source of pharmaceuticals to the environment. The aim of this research was to examine hospital effluent for two such antimicrobials, ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim. Methods: Effluent samples were collected from Hospital A sewers; municipal sewers at points upstream and downstream of hospital effluent discharge; intake effluent (untreated, stage 0) to secondary waste water treatment plant; primary treated effluent (stage 1); post return effluent (stage 2) and final treated effluent (stage 3). Effluent was filtered using glass-fiber filters, acidified to pH 2.5 and pre-concentrated using solid phase extraction on a mixed-mode reversed phase-strong cation exchange sorbent before analysis by liquid chromatography with both single and tandem mass spectrometry (using secondary product ion scan mode).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "R2196 Comparison of antibiotic prescription behaviour between general practitioners and specialists"}, {"text": ": Ciprofloxacin (parent m/z = 332; 2o ions m/z = 228 and 314) was not detected in any effluent sample indicating either rapid degradation, sorption to solid material (log P \u2248 2.3) or insufficient sensitivity of the method.

The implications of this finding for the emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance merit further investigation and it may be appropriate to consider measures to mitigate discharge of antimicrobial substances from hospitals.

They were positive by SpeedOligo assay too. 5 out of 30 (16.6%) swabs used for SpeedOligo assay were positive for GBS. 3 of them were positive by culture too, but in two positive cases by SpeedOligo the results were negative by culture. Comparison of this rapid and simple assay by culture as a gold standard for detection of GBS revealed sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 92.6%. Conclusion: SpeedOligo GBS proved to be a rapid, sensitive and specific assay for the detection of GBS based on nucleic acid amplification technique. This test could be very useful for detecting colonization and infection with GBS in pregnant women during the hole time of pregnancy.

Among the 8 secretion systems known to date, type I, II, III, IV, V and VI have been reported in P. aeruginosa. These secretion systems have been intensively studied in a small number of reference strains, but there is, with the exception of type III secretion system, a lack of data regarding their distribution and relevance in clinical strains. This study is aimed at identifying genes encoding components and effectors of protein secretion systems in P. aeruginosa isolated from acute infections. Methods: P. aeruginosa strains were isolated from patients hospitalized in at high-risk departments such as intensive care unit and hematology. Genotyping was performed using SpeI-PFGE and rep-PCR with BOX and ERIC primers. A total of 8 multiplex PCR assays were designed to target from 1 to 3 genes encoding structural and secreted proteins of secretion systems I-VI. Results: A total of 113 P. aeruginosa strains were isolated from 69 patients. Genotyping using rep-PCR and PFGE allowed to assign 78 strains to 13 clusters, while 37 strains showed an unrelated, unique profile. All strains possessed the genes encoding effectors associated with type V and VI secretion systems. Genes encoding proteins secreted by type II were found in all clones examined, except for gene lapA, which is located in a Region of Genomic Plasticity. The presence of genes encoding effector proteins ExoS, ExoY, and ExoU transported by type III secretion system was certified in the 58% of the strains, in the remaining ones there seems to be an incompatibility between exoS and exoU.

Objective: In this study, we analyze the establishment of the fecal microbiota in a group of 14 children during the first year of life, living in low socio-economic conditions in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil, based on 16S rDNA gene libraries analysis. Methods: Fecal samples were collected from healthy and exclusively breastfed children at different time point: 2nd, 7th, 30th days and 3, 6 and 12 months of life. Bacterial DNA was extracted directly from samples, and 16S rDNA libraries were constructed using bacterial-specific primers 27F and 1492R. Randomly selected clones were partially sequenced. Real-time PCR for Bifidobaterium spp. was performed in the 30th day samples and 3 months. Results: The main phylogenetic group identified in all time point samples was E. coli.

One hundred and forty-four faecal samples from children under 6 years of age(mean age, 2.18\u00b1SD 3.64 years, range: 1-72 months)(negative for the presence of pathogenic bacteria by standard culture methods) were tested by novel multiplex RTPCR methods for detection of \u2212 Norovirus G1, G2, Rotavirus group A, Sapoviruses(SaV), Astroviruses(HAstV), Adenovirus Group F, Adenovirus genus and an internal control phage RNA (MS2). The assays were one-step RTPCR reactions based on detection of four different fluorophores in real-time on an ABi 7500. RTPCR negative samples were also examined by electron microscopy (EM). Results: Among the diarrheal viruses detected, NoV GII was the most common, with a proportion of 27.7%(n:40), whereas group A rotavirus(28), adenovirus F(1), adenovirus GNS (8), SaV(5), and HAstV (2) were also found in 19.4, 6.25, 2.8, and 1.4%, respectively. Overall 82 (57%) samples were positive by RTPCR and of the 62 negative samples 53 had sufficient volume to be examined by EM.

Introduction: The Herpesviridae viruses are widely spread among human population and have the ability to establish lifelong latent infections. In immunocompetent individuals, the virus reactivation is usually harmless and undetectable. Human herpesviruses and enteroviruses are the major causative agents of the central nervous system (CNS) viral infections. The common clinical symptoms caused by these viruses make necessary the optimization of molecular methods that allow multiple, sensitive, and rapid identification of these viruses. Objective: To improve sensitivity and automate a system for simultaneous detection of Human Herpesviruses (HSV-1, HSV-2, VZV, CMV, EBV, HHV-6, HHV-7 and HHV-8) and Enteroviruses (Echoviruses, Poliovirus and Cosxackievirus), CLART \u00ae ENTHERPEX. Method: Virus detection is performed by multiplex RT-PCR and improved PCR. We have developed an array detection system (ArrayStrip) for the simultaneous processing of multiple samples in microplate or individual strips. We have analyzed 40 samples and QCMD samples in order to determine the new diagnostic parameters of the kit: reproducibility, repeatability, sensitivity, and specificity. All the discrepancies were validated with sequencing, homemade PCR and nested-PCR. Furthermore, we have compared results from our kit, CLART \u00ae ENTHERPEX, with real-time qPCR results. Results: We determined an analytical sensitivity of HSV1 and VZV of 10 copies. A 100% value of analytical sensitivity ranging from 10 to 100 copies was obtained in the detection of rest of viral specimens. Analyzing the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity, the behaviour of each virus after the validation of clinical specimens showed that most of viruses show sensitivity higher than 83%, specificity higher than 97%, reproducibility higher than 92% and repeatability higher than 95%. Conclusion: CLART \u00ae ENTHERPEX is a useful tool for rapid screening and simultaneous detection of a Human Herpesviruses and Enteroviruses in clinical setting, being able to process up to 96 samples simultaneously in a working day.

The cobas \u00ae 4800 HPV Test is a multiplex assay that detects HPV 16, HPV 18, and 12 other high-risk (12-HR) carcinogenic HPV genotypes with separate reporter dyes. The purpose of this study was to investigate the correlation of the cobas 4800 \u00ae HPV Test results obtained from direct testing of cervical cytology specimens collected in SurePath LBC medium (BD Diagnostics) to results obtained using the residual processed cell-pellet of the same SurePath sample. Methods: A convenience sample of paired unprocessed and pelleted SurePath LBC cervical specimens were collected from a pool of cervical cancer screening specimens following cytological interpretation. Paired unprocessed and pelleted specimen fractions were tested by the cobas 4800 HPV \u00ae Test. Data analysis included percent agreement of paired HPV results and their association with cervical cytology. Discordant results and paired HPV 16 and HPV 18 positive results were validated using the Linear Array (LA) HPV genotyping assay (Roche Molecular Systems). Results: A total of 300 paired specimens were tested and 274 were included for data analysis; the remaining 26 were deemed 'invalid' by the cobas 4800 due to specimen inadequacy. Overall, the percent total agreement between unprocessed and pelleted specimen pairs was 96.5%. The percent positive agreement for paired HPV 16, HPV 18, and HPV 12-HR tests was 92% (38 of 42), 75% (16 of 21), and 87% (98 of 105), respectively. The unprocessed SurePath specimen was HPV negative for thirteen of the 18 discordant HPV paired results. Cytological results showed an equal distribution of Normal, LSIL, and ASCUS findings for 92% of total specimens. Notably, 88% of HPV 12-HR positive paired specimens were associated with LSIL/ASCUS cytology. Operationally, we did not encounter any significant processing or technical difficulties during this evaluation of the cobas 4800 system. Conclusion: This is the first report to describe the performance of the cobas \u00ae 4800 HPV Test using unprocessed SurePath LBC specimens, in comparison to results obtained following a routine concentration process performed to enhance cytological analysis.

Five-hundred-fourteen samples (77.9%) were correctly identified with HR and LR probes. Untargeted genotypes more frequently found were HPV53 (9.7%), HPV66 (9.4%), HPV61 (4.2%), HPV84 (4.0%) and HPV54 (3.8%).

Methods: Dilutions of quantified HSV-1 and 2 virus were used in analytical studies to determine the limit of detection of the assay. Analytical specificity was determined by testing a panel of related pathogens to determine whether any cross reactivity was observed. Clinical sensitivity was determined by comparison to an HSV-1 and 2 PCR assay developed in the Focus Diagnostics reference laboratory, with discordant samples being analyzed by DNA sequencing.

Two sets of PCR primers were selected to amplify only LGV serovars: A set (pmpH) to amplify 168-pb DNA fragment and another (LGV) to amplify 130-pb. The PCR reaction was carried out in a volume of 20 mL and was performed in a LightCycler 480. The final product was purified and sequenced using BigDye Terminator V. 3.1 chemistry according to the kit instructions. Sequencing reactions were purified with AutoSeq G-50 and sequenced on an ABI 3130 Genetic Analyzer.

Rapid and technically simple typing of gastrointestinal pathogens with a high degree of interlaboratory comparability is needed to enhance outbreak investigations. Methods: RS for 31 unique SS isolates from human, animal and food processing sources representing 16 PFGE clonal groups (defined using established guidelines) were determined in triplicate. Study isolates were harvested from overnight growth on tryptic-soy agar plates, suspended in sterile water, spun down and 3ul of a heavy suspension loaded onto 24-well test slides.

Preliminary information suggests that this may not apply to clinical isolates. This may difficult our understanding of the importance of OMP in antibiotic resistance and other relevant issues. The aim of this study was to compare OMP patterns of multiresistant E. coli and of E. coli K12 grown in different environmental conditions. Methods: Clonally-unrelated (as defined by Rep-PCR/PFGE) multirresistant E. coli cultured from diferent patients, producing (n = 48) or not (n = 64) extended-sprectrum b-lactamases (ESBL) were studied. E. coli K12 (EcK12, strain MKW505) was used as a control. OMPs were obtained from sonicated cells treated with sarcosyl, concentrated by centrifugation and separated in SDS-PAGE (running gels with 12% poliacrilamide and 6M urea). All 112 isolates were grown overnight at 37\u00baC in Mueller-Hinton broth (MH) or in Nutrient broth (NB). Six isolates representative of the more frequent patterns were selected for additional studies, evaluating OMP expresion in different conditions of osmolarity (bacteria grown in NB alone or NB plus 20% sorbitol), temperature (cultures incubated in NB or MH at 30\u00baC, 25\u00baC or 41\u00baC) and pH (isolates grown in NB or MH adjusted to 8.5, 7.2, 5.5 or 5.0). Results: SDS-PAGE showed 11 and 8 different OMP patterns in clinical isolates of multirresistant E. coli producing or not ESBLs, respectively. In most cases no differences were observed when isolates had grown in MH or in NB, in contrast to the results observed in EcK12, were OmpF expression was downregulated in MH. OMP patterns from clinical isolates grown in NB-20% sorbitol were not different of those from bacteria grown in NB alone, while OmpF downregulation was noted for EcK12 in the high osmolarity medium. Incubation at 41\u00baC caused decreased expression of OmpC in some (4/6) organisms (not including EcK12 when OmpF expression is affected) grown in MH, but no significant changes were observed at 30\u00baC or 25\u00baC. Variations in the expression of OmpF were also observed when organisms were grown in media with pH of 5.5 or 5.0. Conclusions: OMP expression patterns in clinical isolates of multirresistant E. coli are usually different of the pattern observed in E. coli K12.

All sera were tested for HSV-1 and HSV-2 specific antibodies by the fully automated bead-based multiplexing immunoassay BioPlex 2200 system. Results: Among adults clinically asymptomatic for herpes disease, 90.2% and 45.1% were seropositive for HSV-1 and HSV-2, respectively. Among children clinically asymptomatic for herpes disease, 81.3% and only 5% were seropositive for HSV-1 and HSV-2, respectively. These observations are consistent with the natural history of HSV-1 and HSV-2 infections in sub-Saharan Africa, demonstrating early acquisition of HSV-1 in children, whereas HSV-2 infection appears largely acquired in later age of sexual life.

Objective: To describe the clinical presentation of patients with confirmed A/H1N1 infection and to compare them with other patients who were negative for A/H1N1 virus. Methods: More than 800 patients presented to our hospital with flu-like symptoms since the beginning of the A/H1N1 pandemic. In 156 of them a pharyngeal sample for PCR test was obtained. Most of the samples were obtained during the surveillance phase, in order to identify and isolate patients and thus to prevent the spread of the disease. Results: From the 156 samples, 103 were positive and 53 were negative. The table summarizes the symptoms of both the patients groups. Conclusions: Among patients with positive PCR the prominent symptoms were malaise and fever. Generally, the more typical clinical presentation was more likely to lead to a positive test. It should not be ignored though, the fact that there were cases with low fever and very mild disease that were proved to be positive, while others with more typical clinical presentation were negative. Patients who had not strong possibility (based on their clinical condition) to be positive but were tested for safety reasons (e.g. people with immunocomprimised members in their families) were most likely to be negative.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Results:"}, {"text": "Positive Objective: The reported number of Chlamydia trachomatis (CT) associated with lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) has increased in the last decade (around 10%/year) with small outbreaks since 2003 described in Europe. However in Spain only sporadic cases have been reported in North and Northeast areas. We explore the presence of serovars associated to LGV among high risk population in Madrid, Spain, and the usefulness of molecular methods to detect and genotype CT-LGV associated serovars. Methods: Two high risk population groups from our city were included in this study: i) sentinel population and ii) patients attended in the 2 Units of Sexually Transmitted Infections (STI) in two public hospitals. 496 urethral, cervix and rectal swabs from symptomatic patients were recovered during six months (May-October, 2009). Two commercial PCR-based methods (Abbott Molecular and Beckton Dickinson) were performed for routine diagnostic of CT infection. An in-house TaqMan real time-PCR (qPCR) based in a deletion on the pmpH gene was used to specifically detect LGV related serovars (L1, L2 and L3). To identify specific serovars, nested-PCR and sequencing of ompA gene were applied. Results: 34 samples from sentinel population and 20 from groupii yielded a positive CT amplification, which represent 10% of analysed samples. Among these positive samples, 6 showed also specific amplification for L-serovars (11%), one urethral and five rectal swabs. These results were obtained in 6 men who have sex with men, with multiple sexual partners during last year. Interestingly, four patients were Spanish, indicating spread of LGV among native population. Four of them were HIV positive and all had concomitant STI: three had gonococcal proctitis, two infections by high risk papilomavirus and one herpes simplex infection. BLAST analysis of the sequence of the ompA gene shows concordance with the L2b serovar in all cases, as has been previously described in recent outbreaks in Europe. Conclusion: To our knowledge, the percentage of L2b serovar found in this work (11%) is the highest value published in Spain, confirming the spread of this serovar across Europe. The high correlation between CTpositive and L2b serovar in native population suggests that this serovar is already established among Spanish population.

Methods: Hospital infection control committee data was reviewed retrospectively between years 2005 and 2009 fist nine months. CDC case definitions for nosocomial infections were used. Antimicrobial susceptibilities were determined by VITEK 2 system. Microbiological data, the site of isolation were extracted. Results: Totally 381 patients were followed in 10807 patient days(pd). General hospital infection rates and their distribution were summarized in table 1. Infection rates in 2007 were seen to be higher with 27.03 infections/1000pd. The burn unit was temporarily closed and beds were decreased in order to plan a revision because of the high infection rates in 2007 and infection rates decreased dramatically. Burn infections were increased in 2009(66.66 infections/1000pd). This increase was linked to transferring to a temporary clinic with inappropriate conditions. Urinary infection rates were highest in 2006(31.66 infections/1000pd) decreased from that time. This was thought to be the result of urinary tract infection control education all over the hospital. Blood stream infections were at most in 2008 with a rate of 34.28%. Gram-negative microorganisms tended to decrease until 2007 and than increased. The most prevalent microorganism was Pseudomonas aeruginosa from 2005 to 2007(38%, 30.4% and 26.6% respectively) but Acinetobacter baumannii took place in 2008 and 2009 with rates of 25.9%, 59.1% respectively. Extended spectrum b lactamase rate was high in all years (60%, 70%, 59%, 45.6%, 63.2% in Escherichia coli and 78.1%, 40%, 53.5%, 56% and 68% in Klebsiella pneumoniae respectively) and all Staphylococcus aureus isolates were meticilline resistant. Antimicrobial resistance was also remarkable in Gram-negatives especially in Acinetobacter baumannii spp. Conclusion: As a conclusion high overall infection and resistance rates were seen. Hospital infection rates, causative microorganisms tended to be influenced from physical conditions, infection control measures and compliance and also from overall hospital implementations. Unit based and general standards should be established with the support and reinforcement of hospital administration in order to decrease hospital infections. Methods: we perform a retrospective cohort study in 16 high complexity hospitals in the city. We include 374 patients with bloodstream infection (BI) in ICU, identified from an antimicrobial resistance surveillance system. A systematic chart review was performed, severity of illness, comorbidity, type of infection, therapy and demographic variables were collected. Attributable mortality was analyzed in a post hoc committee. Time to event date was modeled. Results: 187 Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and 187 Methicillin-susceptible (MSSA) in ICU were documented. Gross mortality 51.6%, attributable mortality to S. aureus bacteremia 25.13%. MRSA-BI attributable mortality 31% vs. 19% in MSSA-BI. Log rank test (p < 0.05) between survival functions for MRSA and MSSA (Figure 1 ). When multivariable adjusted in a proportional hazard model, independent predictors for attributable mortality are Charlson's comorbidity index >3, septic shock, no adequate clinical response in day 3 and early change in antimicrobial therapy. Meticillin resistance and inappropriate initial therapy were not observed as significant predictors of attributable mortality. Conclusion: MRSA-BI show a different survival function compared with MSSA-BI, high gross and attributable mortality for patients with BI by S. aureus in ICU. Some mortality predictors were comorbidity, severity, early treatment and early response. Objectives: To assess the prevalence of T. vaginalis infection in symptomatic and asymptomatic women, attending a major gynecological hospital in Athens, Greece and to evaluate four methods for the diagnosis of T. vaginalis infection. Methods: Specimens were collected consecutively, from 502 women attending the outpatient clinic of Alexandra Hospital, during the period 2006-2007. Two hundred fifty-five of them were symptomatic and 247 asymptomatic. Three hundred fifty-eight were Greek and 126 were immigrants. All women completed a questionnaire including demographic data, medical history and behavioral/sexual information. The presence of T. vaginalis in vaginal samples was assessed using wet mount, culture in modified Diamond's medium, antigen detection and two PCR assays, targeting different regions of T. vaginalis genome. Specimens were considered positive for T. vaginalis, when found positive either by culture or by both PCRs. Kappa test for agreement between diagnostic tests was also determined. Results: Twenty-three women (4.6%) were found positive for T. vaginalis. Infection was more prevalent in symptomatic women (6.7%) than in asymptomatic ones (2.4%). T. vaginalis was more frequently detected in immigrants (7.9%) than in Greek women (3.3%). Gardnerella vaginalis infection was significantly more frequent in women infected with T. vaginalis.

Norazah (Kuala Lumpur, MY) Objective: Acanthamoeba keratitis is one of the most severe and potentially sight-threatening ocular parasitic infectious diseases and is recognized as the most challenging among ocular infections. In vitro susceptibility testing of Acanthamoeba isolates may prove beneficial for application of early treatment regimens. This study was conducted to determine the effectiveness of the drugs in therapeutic dose and the minimum cysticidal concentrations (MCCs) of the drugs. Methods: Serial doubling dilutions of chlorhexidine digluconate from 200 mg/ml to 0.097 mg/ml, propamidine isethionate (Brolene) from 1000 mg/ml to 0.488 mg/ml and gentamicin from 40000 mg/ml to 19.531 mg/ml were performed in microtiter plate and tested against 3 Acanthamoeba isolates which were isolated from keratitis cases. After the exposure of the cysts to the drugs for 24 hours, the cysts were washed free of drugs by centrifugation. The deposit (cysts) was cultured onto nonnutrient agar plates overlaid with heat-killed Escherichia coli. The replication and growth of the trophozoites from cysts exposed to each of the dilutions were observed and recorded microscopically for 14 days to determine the MCC of each drug. The effectiveness of the drugs in therapeutic dose against the cysts was tested directly without any doubling dilutions. Results: Chlorhexidine digluconate and propamidine isethionate (Brolene) successfully exhibited their cysticidal activities in therapeutic dose but not for gentamicin and chloramphenicol. The minimum cysticidal concentration (MCC) of chlorhexidine ranged from 25 mg/ml to 50 mg/ml, propamidine isethionate ranged from 500 mg/ml to 1000 mg/ml and gentamicin ranged from 10000 mg/ml to 20000 mg/ml.

Objectives: The prevalence of cryptosporidium and the risk factors of zoonotic transmission on Najafabad, Isfahan, Iran dairy farms were examined. Materials and Methods: Sampling and specimen processing: One fecal sample collected from all calves less than 6 months old on 8 dairy farms around Najafabad (Isfahan province, central Iran) as well as individuals working in these farms and their household members. During September to March 2008, 218 and 422 fecal samples collected from calves and humans respectively. Each specimen placed in a plastic vial, brought immediately to laboratory and stored at 4\u00baC until analysis. All of the samples were stained by the modified Ziehl-Neelsen method and examined under bright field microscopy. DNA extraction: Fecal samples were subjected to six cycles of freezethaw in liquid nitrogen and a 95\u00baC water bath to rupture the oocysts. DNA was isolated from aliquots of frozen stool. 18S rRNA gene amplification and sequencing. A two-step nested PCR protocol was used to amplify the 18S rRNAgene (830 bp). PCR products were analyzed on 1% agarose gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining. Results: Cryptosporidium was identified in the stool of 36 (prevalence 8.5%) of 96 farm workers and 326 household members. Furthermore, 31 (14.2%) of 218 calf samples were positive. Based on 18s rRNA gene amplification and sequencing, cryptosporidium parvum was identified in 72% of the positive farm workers and 65% of the positive household members. Of the positive calves, 64.5% were infected with C. parvum, indicating possible zoonotic transmission on these farms. Univariate analysis of potential risk factors revealed that contact with calves (P < 0.0001) was the most significant risk factor of C. parvum infection. A considerable negative association was observed between C. parvum infection and cleaning of shoes/boots after daily work (P < 0.004), hand washing (P < 0.013) and use of piped water (P < 0.006). In the multivariate analysis with logistic regression, only contact with calves was significant. Conclusion: Zoonotic transmission of C. parvum due to contact with calves is predominant among farm workers and their household members of this region and appropriate health measures must be applied to control the infection and decrease of zoonotic transmission of this parasite.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusion:"}, {"text": "S.

Galli (Milan, IT) Objectives: To describe prevalence of hospitalization and clinical spectrum of fever in returning travellers and migrants in Italy. Methods: Retrospective charts review of all febrile illnesses developing within 3 months after a stay in the tropics and hospitalised between 1998 and 2008 at the Infectious Diseases Clinic of Milan, Italy. Results: Near 4% (270/6827) of all hospital admissions in the study period were due to fever in travellers and migrants returning from the tropics. 188 (69.6%) were men, the median age was 32 years (range 16\u221275 years). 173 were Italian citizens, 97 (36%) were extra-European migrants (52% classified as visiting friends and relatives). As shown in figure 1 malaria was the most common specific etiologic diagnosis, found in 49.5% of ill returned travellers with fever. Fiftythree percent of all malaria cases were diagnosed in migrants. Causes of fever varied by region visited (76% of malaria were acquired in sub-Saharan Africa, OR 47.6, 95% CI 13.8-163.4; dengue fever was acquired in Latin America Indian subcontinent and south-central Asia in 86% of cases) and by time of presentation after travel (dengue accounted for the early presentation). 9.2% of travellers with fever had a vaccine preventable infection. Sixteen percent of patients had an acute viral infections excluding viral hepatitis that accounted for 7.7% of all causes of fever. Conclusions: During a 11-year period, the number of patients returning from tropical areas who were admitted with fever to a university hospital in northern Italy remained stable. Malaria remains the most frequent diagnosis accounting for near 50% of all hospitalization. Dengue fever was the most frequent tropical infection besides malaria. The time of presentation after travel and region visited provides important clues toward establishing a correct diagnosis.. Toxocara canis infections are uncommon in developed countries. However sporadic cases and possibility of systemic involvement, require considering this diagnostic possibility. This is a case report of a 25-year old previously healthy female from urban surroundings, who presented at our clinic with prolonged low-grade fever, abdominal pain, severe lumboishialgia, paraesthesiae, pruritic rash, generalized lymphadenopathy and liver damage. There were no anamnestic data concerning recent travel or contact with animals. Complete laboratory examination revealed hypereosinophilia (12.5%), elevated liver enzymes (AST 246, ALT 306), hyperbilirubinemia, histological non-specific lymph node infiltration, without any radiological findings of focal infection. Toxocara canis infection was confirmed with positive serology tests, and as other tests including virology (hepatitis A, B, C, HIV, herpesviridae, Coxsackie), bacterial cultures (including serology for B. burgdorferi, Brucellae, tests for Tuberculosis), stool tests and available immunoserology for other parasites were negative. After a 10 day treatment with albendazole (400 mg twice a day), patient was afebrile, without any physical complaints including normal levels of liver enzymes and leukocyte formula. Most cases of visceral larva migrans are mild, self-limiting and may mimic many different conditions, but as the available treatment options are effective, it should be suspected in patients with hypereosinophilia and liver damage.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 17, "end": 103, "text": "Galimberti, V.

Faria-Ramos, S. Costa-de-Oliveira\u00b0, A.P. Silva, A.G. Rodrigues, C. Pina-Vaz (Porto, PT) Fluconazole prophylaxis has been associated to an increased prevalence of C. krusei and C. glabrata strains. C. krusei shows intrinsic resistance to fluconazole, but usually not to the other azoles such as voriconazole. C. krusei blood isolates were recovered from a leukemia patient during two months; during this period he was submitted to voriconazole therapy. An increase in minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of voriconazole was registered among consecutive isolates, which finally developed a resistant phenotype. Objectives: Aiming to clarify the acquired resistance mechanism, we raised the hypothesis of such resistance being due to overespression of efflux pumps. Methods: Two clinical C. krusei isolates were studied: one susceptible (MIC 1mg/ml) and one resistant (MIC 8mg/ml) to voriconazole. Agar disk diffusion assay was performed in order to study the synergistic effect between FK506 (Tacrolimus, described as an efflux blocker), and voriconazole, in the resistant C. krusei isolate, as described by Ricardo E. et al (2009) . Ten-fold dilutions of FK506 ranging from 1000 to 1mg/ml were assayed and voriconazole was added to YEPD agar plates at supra-MIC value (1 mg/ml). In order to induce resistance, the susceptible strain was exposed, in vitro, to sub-inhibitory concentrations of voriconazole (1mg/ml). Every day 1ml of culture broth was transferred to new fresh medium, with voriconazole (1mg/ml). Susceptibility profiles to voriconazole were assayed until acquisition of resistance. Flow cytometry assays using rhodamine 6G (Rd-6G) 5mM (an efflux pump fluorescent substrate) were performed in order to compare the resistant isolates (in vivo and in vitro induced) with the susceptible isolate, regarding the role of efflux pumps in C. krusei resistance. Results: Agar disk diffusion assay showed growth inhibition around the disks impregnated with the highest FK506 concentrations (100 and 1000mg/ml). At the 10th day of incubation of the susceptible strain with voriconazole the MIC value was 64mg/ml. Both resistant strains showed less intensity of fluorescence when stained with Rd-6G 5mM comparing to the susceptible isolate. Conclusions: A synergistic effect was observed between voriconazole and the highest FK506 concentrations. The resistant strains accumulate less intracellular Rd-6G than the susceptible strain, which means that prolonged exposition to voriconazole, in vivo and in vitro, induced resistance associated to efflux pumps activity.

Candida infections mainly evolve from endogenous colonization, thus the detection of the colonization is very important. In this study; we evaluated candida colonization in the intensive care unit patients by using candida colonization index (CI) and aimed to predictive value of colonization index for invasive candidiasis. Methods: From September 2008 to February 2009, 100 patients older than 18 years of age in the intensive care unit were included in this study. Throat, nose, skin (axilla), urine and rectal swab cultures were taken weekly from each patients. Also tracheal aspirates, drain and central vascular catheter cultures were taken if there were. Candida colonization index was calculated by the ratio of the number of culture positive sites to the number of sites cultured. Results: Candida colonization was found in 42 of 100 patients. Of these colonized patients, invasive candidiasis developed in nine patients, candidemia in five and urinary tract infection in four. Most of the colonized patients were in the surgical intensive care unit (ICU), staying longer length in the ICU and had more invasive instrument. Additionally candida colonization was diagnosed mostly in the patients with bacterial sepsis and exposed to broad spectrum antibiotics. Colonization index was found to be greater than 0.5 in 8 of 42 patients. Heavy colonization (CI > 0.5) was only determined in one of the nine patients with invasive candidiasis.

After they were all correctly recognized, two prospective studies were done in parallel during one year (Sept. 2008 to Aug. 2009 ): (i) 36 cultures of difficult-to-identify fungi (12 yeasts and 24 moulds) obtained from different clinical samples were identified by molecular methods, and (ii) the presence and identification of fungi in 39 invasive samples other than blood (10 bronchoalveolar lavages, 5 bronchoalveolar brushes, 7 heart valves and 17 biopsies (joint: 8;lung: 7;brain: 2) were determined using a conventional approach and compared with the results of a molecular method based on sequencing the Internal Transcriber Spacer (ITS) regions 1 and 2, complemented with sequencing the b-tubulin and the elongation factor genes, and the intergenic spacer (IGS) region. Results: All 36 organisms of objective (i) were identified by the molecular method as concrete species of genera Aspergillus (9), Candida (7), Trichosporon (5), Scedosporium (3), Alternaria (3), fusarium (3), Microsporum (2), Penicilium (2), Sporotrichum (1) or Acremonium (1). 35 out the 39 samples of objective (ii) were negative by both culture and molecular methods. Moulds were identified by the molecular approach in two cases in which the same organism grew in culture (a joint biopsy and a heart valve from the same patient yielding Scedosporium apiospermum). Additionally, the molecular approach identified an Aspergillus sidowii in a lung biopsy and an A. fumigatus in a bronchoalveolar brush in two culture-negative cases. The molecular method allowed identification of the organism (from either culture or clinical samples) in 48\u221272 hours. Conclusions: Molecular methods reduces the response time for identification of clinically relevant fungi (include those for which conventional identification is difficult). This approach should be considered for the diagnosis of fungal infections in the clinical laboratory.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 3, "end": 87, "text": "Unda\u00b0, J. Ag\u00fcero Balbin, R.

The aim of the study was the evaluation and retrospective analysis of fungaemias in the intensive care unit (ICU) of a tertiary care hospital. Methods: Patients hospitalized in the ICU longer than 48 h were included in this study, over a 5-year period (2004) (2005) (2006) (2007) (2008) (2009) . Demographic characteristics, predisposing factors, incidence of fungaemia, susceptibility profile, therapy and outcome were analyzed. Laboratory investigation was performed by conventional methods. Chromogenic medium and API 32C were used for the identification, while antifungal susceptibility was assessed by MICs determination using a broth microdilution method according to CLSI recommendations. Results: In total, 74 strains were isolated from 70 patients. The mean age was 59 years and 55 were male. In 8 patients, the same pathogen was isolated from both blood and i.v. catheter cultures. Predisposing factors included cardiovascular disorders (n = 20), diabetes mellitus (n = 13), malignancy (n = 12), respiratory failure (n = 8), burns (n = 6), chronic alcohol consumption and alcoholic cirrhosis (n = 5) and chronic renal failure (n = 3). Six patients suffered from hematological malignancies, and one was HIV positive. Non-albicans Candida strains were the most frequent isolates (n = 39, 53%): C. parapsilosis 20 (27%), C. tropicalis 9 (12%), C. glabrata 9 (12%) and C. dubliniensis 1 (1.3%). Thirty strains (40.5%) were identified as C. albicans. Thee strains Saccharomyces bullardii (4%), one strain Zygosaccharomyces spp. (1.3%) and one Rhodotorula mucinanginosa (1.3%) were also isolated. All antifungal agents showed excellent activity against most of these potentially lethal pathogens. However, two strains of C. glabrata were resistant to itraconazole and fluconazole, three strains of C. albicans were resistant to caspofugin and two strains of C. tropicalis were resistant to itraconazole. R. mucinanginosa was sensitive only to amphotericinB, fluconazole and ketoconazole. All patients were treated with amphotericinB and/or caspofungin. Case fatality was 38%. Conclusion: Candidemia was the most common fungal nosocomial infection among ICU patients with high mortality rate. Candida nonalbicans were the most prevalent strains (53%). Early diagnosis and initiation of antifungal therapy, as well as control of the underlying predisposing factors, are the only potentially curative options for this emerging invasive infection. . At time of syphilis seropositivity, median CD4-cells count was below 500/mm 3 (~459/mm 3 , range, 77-840/mm 3 ) and median plasmatic HIV-RNA virus load was 3.0 log/mL (range, \u22121.8 to \u22125.8 log/mL). Secondary syphilis was more frequent (9 patients, 33%) than primary (7 patients, 26%), latent syphilis (10 patients, 37%) and symptomatic neurosyphilis (1 patient, 4%). Overall, 20 patients (74%) received parenteral treatment and 7 (26%) oral for 21 days. Lumbar puncture was performed in 17 neurologically asymptomatic (63%) and 1 symptomatic patient (4%). 10 patients (37%) denied undergoing the procedure. 10 (37%) were diagnosed with neurosyphilis. Satisfactory serologic response was observed in 10 patients (37%) at 6 and 9 months follow up and in 17 (63%) at 6\u22129-12 months follow up, respectively. Discussion: Multiple sexual partners, unprotected oral sex, and increased age among MSM were the predominant risk factors contributing to this syphilis epidemic. The overall high rate of unprotected sex demonstrates an increasing prevalence of unsafe sexual practices among MSM attributed to faith in antiretroviral therapy (simplified regimen) and to mental fatigue arising from years of protected sex to reduce the risk of HIV. Therefore, it is essential that prompt diagnosis, treatment, and contact tracing occur in order to control this major outbreak.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1057, "end": 1221, "text": ".

Methods: Ambulatory and in-patients (n = 20, male/female: 10/10) at Ume\u00e5 university hospital with confirmed nephropathia epidemica (NE) were followed with routine blood chemistry and sampled for peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) during day 1 and 3 and a follow-up convalescent sample after 12 weeks. The PBMC were stored in \u221270\u00baC until RNA was extracted using RNeasy kit (Quiagen). cDNA synthesis was performed and expression of ER a, ER b and ER b cx (mRNA splice variant of ER b) were quantitatively estimated using real-time PCR (Applied Biosystems). The multiple variables from the blood chemistry, relative expression levels of ERs mRNA, sex, and day of onset of the disease were related to each other in a principal component analysis (PCA)(SIMCA-P, v 11.5.0.0). Results: ER a is expressed in higher quantities than ER b cx. ER b (wild type) could not be detected. ER a is correlated to a rise in white blood cells (WBC) (p = 0.0004) in the total group of patients (n = 20) and divided into males (n = 10) and females (n = 10), a correlation is seen between ER a and urea (p = 0.03), C-reactive protein (CRP) (p = 0.04) and WBC (p = 0.01) in the male patient group, compared to a correlation between ER a and WBC (p = 0.04) in the female patient group. The PCA show a distinct dichotomy of male and female samples. Female samples tend to be correlated to a higher level of ER a, and male samples to higher levels of ER b cx. Conclusion: Our results from the PCA indicate a different clinical presentation in men and women with NE. This could explain that more men than women (2\u22125:1) receive the clinical diagnosis NE although the serological distribution is 1:1. Females were associated with higher levels of ER a and males with ER b cx. ER b cx is known to dimerize with ER a and thereby prevent the normal function of ER a. A larger study is needed to confirm the role of ER a and ER b cx in this disease. R. Caylan\u00b0, D. Yapar, S. Keske, I. Hasanoglu, M.A. Tasyaran (Ankara, TR) Introduction: Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever is a tick-borne viral disease. The virus is acquired by the bite of infected ticks. Transmission also may occur from direct or aerosol contact of blood or secretions of infected patients. Health-care workers are at increased risk of acquired infection while caring for haemorrhagic patients. Nosocomial CCHF mortality rate is higher than the other routes (respectively 80%, 10\u221250%). Ribavirin is recommended during postexposure prophylaxis and treatment of CCHF, however it is controversial. Case report: In June 2009, 56-year-old female patient who was diagnosed as CCHF with positive PCR result from Refik Saydam National Public Health Agency, was developed oral mucosal and vaginal bleeding, melena during the sixth day of therapy. Patient was confused and she had seizures due to intracranial haemorrhage in sixth day of hospitalization. The patient's existing oral and nasal haemorrhagies increased during these seizures. Physician intervented only with disposable gloves because the patient needed emergency airway management and placed oral airway immediately without surgical mask or eye protection. Patient died after a few hours with widespread bleeding. Five days after this intervention 33-year-old female physician presented fever, headache, myalgia and malaise. Her temperature was 38\u00baC, pulse 88 beats/min; blood pressure was 90/60 mmHg. Laboratory findings; Blood biochemical tests were normal, haemoglobin 11 g/dL leukocytes 900 K/mcL and platelet count of 76000 K/mcL. Oral ribavirin started quickly for the possible nosocomial transmission. The ribavirin dose was 2 g for loading, followed by 4 g/day for 4 days and 2 g/day for 3 days. She had no history of percutaneous exposure. Probably close contact with aerosolisation of blood or excretions are suspected route of transmission. Diagnosis was confirmed by RT-PCR. During the follow-up platelet counts persisted on decreasing and the liver enzymes slightly increased. No fever was detected after the third day. Haemorrhagic manifestations didn't develop. Significant side effects of ribavirin were not observed. Patient's symptoms improved after seventh day of admission. In conclusion, to prevent transmission of CCHF in close contact with haemorrhagic patients, droplet and contact precautions must be performed. Although it is controversial early onset of ribavirin had been found to be effective in our case. Objectives: Crimean Congo Hemorrhagic Fever (CCHF) is a severe hemorrhagic fever caused by a Nairovirus, belonging to the family Bunyaviridae. In the spread of this zoonosis to humans, the main role is that of ticks; however, transmission is also possible via blood, tissue and bodily fluids of infected people or animals. Nosocomial transmission is also possible and, health care workers are one of the major risk groups for CCHF virus acquisition especially when caring for patients with hemorrhages from different body sites. In this paper we are reporting CCHF in two health care workers whose did not have any contact to blood or body fluids of a patient. Case 1: 30 years old and pregnant nurse (ten weeks) admitted to our clinic with sudden onset high fever, myalgia, arthralgia and fatigue. She was caring the patients with CCHF in our clinic. Four days ago, in her shift, one patient died because of CCHF, the patient had respiratory symptoms and renal insufficiency. Although we don't have negativepressure room, all the patients had to be isolated in a private room, and all healthcare workers are using barrier-nursing techniques that include disposable gloves, masks and goggles and hand-washing or use of alcohol based desenfectans are the main way of protection. We isolated the nurse and sent serum samples to the national reference laboratory for CCHF tests. Next day she was diagnosed as CCHF with positive PCR and with her informed consent, ribavirin treatment was given. On the following days, fever was continued and alanine aminotransferase, lactat dehydrogenase, creatine phosphokinase levels were increased. After five days, clinical and laboratory findings improved and she discharged with a medical abortus decision. Case 2: 26 years old, male resident admitted to our clinic with the same complaint after two days of nurse's admission. He had cared the same patient on same day with the nurse. He was diagnosed CCHF with laboratory RT-PCR test. He had been taking the oral ribavirin with a decision of himself and we continued the therapy. His symptoms began to resolve in third day and he discharged from hospital. The only history of their contacts to inside the patient's room without mask once or twice. Conclusion: Although the main way of transmission of CCHF to health care workers is close contact to blood and other body fluids, transmission with aerosol or air droplets may be possible.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 2414, "end": 2486, "text": "R.

From these patients, 60 (39%) had encephalitis, 64 (41%) patients had meningitis, 7 (4%) patients had encephalomyelitis, 4 (2%) patients had Guillen-Barre syndrome and 21 (14%) patients had various unspecified neurological diseases. Polymerase chain reaction (multiplex consensus nested PCR), as well as serology, were performed for the detection of herpesviruses in CSF. Results: Herpesviruses from CSF were detected in 11 of 156 (7%) patients. Ten of them were adults and one was child. Herpesvirus genome was detected by PCR from 10 patients and there was a patient with encephalitis, the etiologic agent of which, HSV, was identified by intrathecal andibobies production. From 11 patients with herpetic CNS infection 6 had encephalitis, 4 had meningitis and one patient had Guillain-Barre syndrome. Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) genome was detected from 5 patients with encephalitis and a patient with Guillain-Barre, herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) from a patient with meningitis and varicella-zoster virus (VZV) was detected from 3 patients with meningitis. From a patient with encephalitis, the diagnosis was established by HSV intrathecal antibodies detection. The detection of herpesvirus genome from this patient' CSF was impossible. The incidence of herpes simplex encephalitis in our study was 1 patient per 1.000.000 people per year. All patients with meningitis had excellent outcome; however, poor outcome, which led to death, was observed in two of six patients with encephalitis, (mortality 33%). The poor outcome was associated with low Glascow coma scale at the admission to the hospital. In conclusion, HSV-1 was the most common herpesvirus detected in this study, which was the cause of encephalitis with high mortality. HSV-2 and VZV were less frequently detected and caused milder disease, with good outcome.

Basic laboratory tests revealed anemia (Hb = 9.7 mg/dl) and severe thrombocytosis (PLT = 1027\u00d710 3 ). She also had an elevated CA-125 of 982 U/ml (<35U/ml) and a positive tuberculin test (17 mm). She underwent C/T scan which revealed pleural effusions, ascites, a solid lesion of the right ovary and osteolytic and slerosing lesions of the lower thoracic vertebrae, and transvaginal ultrasound which showed a large cystic mass arising from the right ovary. Paracentesis of the ascites was performed; the fluid was an exudate with positive cytology for atypic cells, possibly adenocarcinoma, and negative for AFB. Gastroscopy and barium enema were normal. As the above findings suggested of an advanced ovarian cancer, laparotomy was performed; the macroscopic picture was of multiple whitish lesions over the peritoneum and the intestines (omental cake). Two liters of ascetic fluid were removed and an ADA test was done which came back positive: 55U/ml (13\u221223U/ml). The right ovary and salpynx were removed; the biopsy showed granulomatous tissue. C/T guided biopsy of the vertebral lesions was performed, and PCR for Myc. tuberculosis on the material was done which was positive. The patient was put on anti-TB treatment with isoniazid, rifampicin, pyrazinamid, and ethambutol with gradual improvement. Conclusions: As TB is rare in the developed world, ovarian and peritoneal TB is often misdiagnosed as advanced ovarian cancer, leading young women to unnecessary laparotomy and surgery. Ascites, peritoneal nodules and elevated CA-125, even in the presence of osteolytic lesions of the vertebrae, do not necessarily indicate malignancy.

Methods: This is a retrospective study of 277 patients who were hospitalized in a seven bed ICU during one year period (July 2008 to July 2009). Data on demographic characteristics, primary diagnosis, comorbidity, number of indwelling devices and current antibiotics were cross-tabulated according to the presence and type of Gram (+) pathogens isolated. The identification and antimicrobial sensitivity of Gram-positive pathogens were performed with MicroScan (Dade Behring) according to CLSI instructions. Results: Sixty patients (49, 6% of 121 with documented nosocomial infection) with gram (+) isolates were identified. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE, n = 33) and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA, n = 18) were most commonly isolated, followed by E. faecalis (n = 5) and E. faecium (n = 4). There were no significant differences between the groups according to demographic characteristics. The following independent risk factors for Gram (+) nosocomial infection were identified. For MRSE: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease comorbidity, previous isolation of Acinetobacter sp. and Pseudomonas sp. and previous/current treatment with carbapenem, and for enterococcus sp. previous/current treatment with third generation cephalosporins. The number of indwelling devices was not linked with increased risk of coagulase negative staphylococcal infections. All staphylococci strains were sensitive to vancomycin, teicoplanin and linezolid while three strains of enterococci (one E. faecalis and two E. faecium) were resistant to vancomycin and teicoplanin. Conclusion: To reduce the emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistant Gram (+) pathogens in ICU, monitoring and optimisation of antimicrobial use should be considered carefully. Identification of associated risk factors for Gram positive nosocomial infections would aid initial antibiotic choice in such patients at risk. Objective: Rhodococcus equi infection has been regarded as an opportunistic infection in immunocompromised hosts. Although the organism is easily cultivated from specimens, it may be misdiagnosed as a contaminant or commmensal due to its diphteroid appearance. The AIDS epidemic has resulted in an increase in awareness on the part of the microbiology laboratory in identifying cases of R. equi infections. A prevalence study of R. equi infections in our 3 year-old institution is presented. Methodology: Clinically significant isolates of R. equi that were cultured in the Microbiology Laboratory of Sungai Buloh Hospital, Malaysia between January 2008 until October 2009 were included. The laboratory used the Analytical Profile Index (API) system for the identification of the organism. The case files of the patients were reviewed and discussions with the physician were done to determine the clinical significance of the isolates. Results: R. equi that was deemed clinically significant was isolated from 10 patients over a two-year period (2007) (2008) (2009) . The organism was cultured from blood, sputum and bronchoscopy specimens. All", "cite_spans": [{"start": 719, "end": 795, "text": "Chinou\u00b0, G. Krimpeni, P. Giannakakos, A. Georgouli, E.

Methods: Retrospective chart review of pediatric patients with hematologic/oncologic disorders with bacteremia between January 1998 and December 2008. Demographic data, underlying diseases, bacterial isolates, and antibiotic susceptibility were analyzed. Results: One thousand eight hundred and eighty nine (1889) bacteremia episodes were identified. Gram negative bacteria (GNB) were more frequently isolated causing 954 episodes (51%). Of these, E. coli (23%), P. aeruginosa (21%), K. pneumoniae (18%), Enterobacter spp (7.9%), and S. maltophilia (7%). Seventy four percent of GNB were susceptible to pipracillin/tazobactam, 66% to ceftazidime, 66% to gentamicin and 41% to pipracillin.

Among post-transplant malignancies, the importance of lymphomas is significant, because of their increasing prevalence and their poor prognosis; most cases are of B-cell origin, and EBV-associated. Our aim was to show an EBV-associated lymphoma in a kidney transplant patient. Case description and Methods: A 12-year-old boy underwent kidney transplantation because of congenital urologic malformation. After this, the patient received immunosuppressive treatment and urinary chateterization was necessary due to bladder dysfunction. However the graft function was appropriate, urinary tract infection was diagnosed about 4\u22125 times a year. In June, 2009 the patient was admitted to the Department of Paediatrics, because of sudden grand mal seizure. Brain MRI examination revealed blood-brain injury, and the possibility of multifocal, granulomatous encephalitis or lymphoma has been arisen, this affects white matter and cortex too. PCR for EBV (Artus \u00ae EBV LC PCR Kit, Qiagen) was performed from CSF and brain biopsy specimen, and these gave positive results 1464 copies/ml and 49 200 copies/ml, respectively while CMV PCR (Artus \u00ae CMV LC PCR Kit, Qiagen) was negative. After this, the EBV viral load was determined once a week. Cytologic examination justified posttransplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD). According to these findings, parenteral acyclovir and rituximab treatments were started, besides these everolimus and mycophenolic acid as immunosuppression was applied.

Studies showed that its levels are elevated also in neutropenic patients with sepsis and can be used as a prognostic factor of febrile neutropenia. The aim of our retrospective study was to find out whether PCT levels are a prognostic factor for multi-organ failure and mortality in neutropenic patients with sepsis. Methods: 57 adult patients admitted to the intensive care unit with a diagnosis of sepsis participated in this retrospective study. Based on their absolute neutrophil count the patients were divided into two groups of 27 neutropenic patients and 30 non-neutropenic patients. Neutropenia was defined as the absolute neutrophil count below 1\u00d710 9 . Results: The average PCT level in sepsis patients was 15.6 ng/ml (range 0.08-129 ng/ml) for the neutropenic and 14.6 ng/ml (range 0.08-161.1 ng/ml) for the non-neutropenic group. This difference was not significant (p = 0.45). In the group of neutropenic patients the average PCT concentration was higher for those with multi-organ failure than for those without (21.37 ng/ml vs. 4.67 ng/ml), but the difference was not significant (p = 0.07). Among neutropenic patients who died the average PCT concentration was 12.9 ng/ml (range 0.29-50.6 ng/ml) and among survivors it was 18.2 ng/ml (range 0.08-129 ng/ml), however the difference was not significant (p = 0.32). The group of 11 neutropenic patients with septic shock was further analysed. Among them there was found to be no significant difference in PCT levels between those who died and survivors (p = 0.07) and between those with and without multi-organ failure (p = 0.11). When this group was compared to neutropenic patients without septic shock, however, they were found to have significantly higher values in PCT level (26.4 ng/ml (range 0.42-129 ng/ml) vs. 6.3 ng/ml (range 0.1-36.5 ng/ml), p < 0.05), mortality rate (69.2% vs. 35%, p < 0.05) and rate of multiorgan failure (84.6% vs. 35%, p < 0.05). Conclusion: Our retrospective study confirmed previous findings that PCT levels are increased also in neutropenic patients with sepsis. PCT concentrations in neutropenic and non-neutropenic patients with sepsis are similar. However, our study shows that increased PCT concentrations in neutropenic patients with sepsis can be used as a prognostic factor for septic shock, but not for multi-organ failure and mortality. . We aim to simplify the management of these patients by unifying 3 policies, defining febrile neutropenia and identifying potential antimicrobial agents for use as empirical monotherapy aiming for one FN policy across all 3 groups (P&A&TYA). We collected data relating to Gram-negative bacteraemias aiming to review the feasibility of a suitable agent for monotherapy for all 3 patient groups. Certain patients may need to be managed differently e.g. post allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT). We will present this data and our lessons learned in achieving this important goal of unification of policies. Methods: From our computerised microbiology database we identified all Gram-negative bacteraemias in our patient group between February 2008 and May 2009. For each organism we recorded susceptibilities to 7 antimicrobial agents (gentamicin, tobramycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, aztreonam, ceftazidime, meropenem and ciprofloxacin). We recorded the absolute neutrophil count (ANC) at the time of bacteraemia, diagnosis and treatment received. Where the isolate was resistant to piperacillin/ tazobactam, we determined the initial antimicrobial therapy prescribed and subsequent changes made including the reason for change. Results: We identified 192 bacteraemias in adult haematology patients and 54 bacteraemias in paediatric H/O patients. 93 adult patients had a ANC of <0.1 (48%), with 74 having a ANC of >1 (39%). Of these isolates 12 (6%) were resistant to piperacillin/tazobactam. In the paediatric group, 54 bacteraemias were identified. 24 (44%) had a ANC of <0.1, with 19 (35%) having a ANC >1.

The information from recent studies on clinical characteristics of asplenic patients and infectious complications in this cohort are limited. One of the most likely reason for the highly increased incidence of infections by pneumoocci and other encapsulated bacteria relates to the function of the spleen as it is the only secondary lymphoid organ which allows the generation of plasma cells producing antibodies against bacteria bearing a polysaccharide capsule.

In this retrospective study we investigated the outcome characteristics of 20 HIV infected patients with anal cancer diagnosed at L Sacco University hospital in the period 1998-2008. Methods: Clinical, immuno-virological and treatment parameters for HIV infection and anal cancer were collected from clinical records of 20 HIV infected patients admitted in the II Surgical Unit of our hospital. HPV DNA tests for high and low risk HPV genotypes was performed on fixed histological samples. Results: HIV infection was acquired by sexual route in 70% of the 16 males and 4 females included in this study. At time of anal cancer diagnosis, 80% of the patients were on-HAART and 4 patients were off-HAART according to national guidelines for antiretroviral treatment of HIV infected patients; 13 patients had a previous diagnosis of AIDS. Median CD4 count was 379.7 cells/microL (range 87-863) and median viral load 7421.4 copies/mL (range 50-26000). HPV infection by a combination of high and low risk genotypes was detected on histological samples in 80% of patients.

On admission, the patient complained of fatigue, WBC was 9.6\u00d710 9 /L, and CRP was 150 mg/L. Transthoracic echocardiogram showed a 8 mm vegetation on the tricuspid valve. Vancomycin was started empirically. On day 12 a Gram-negative spiral rod was recovered from blood cultures collected on the day of admission and day 2. The antibiotic was switched to ceftriaxone 2g once daily and gentamicin 80 mg after every haemodialysis for empirical coverage of Campylobacter fetus, a Gramnegative spiral rod known as a cause of IE. The organism grew on a blood agar at microaerophilic condition at 35 degrees Celsius but could not be identified at that time.

Here we report the confirmed cases of this new virus identified in Isfahan, a province in Iran. Methods: In a laboratory-based reporting system, the Provincial Health Centers were supplied by the MoH with case definition and patient information forms to be disseminated to all health care institutions in their province. Any person who fulfilled the case definition criteria was directed to one of the three designated health facilities that were prepared to receive suspected cases. The nasopharyngeal samples were sent to the National Influenza Reference Laboratory at Tehran school of Public Health in a viral transport medium (virocult, Medical wire & Equipment, UK) and were tested with the real time RT-PCR protocol and reagents supplied by the WHO. Results: A total of 376 samples were taken from suspected cases between 1 July and 21 October 2009.50 from these samples were positive for influenza A (H1N1). The date of symptoms onset of the first confirmed case of pandemic H1N1 influenza was 13 July 2009. She had traveled to Mecca (Saudi Arabia) and had already become symptomatic while staying there. 58% of the cases were female. The median age was 27 years (range: 10\u221275 years). The majority of cases (34%) were from 25 to 29 years old. 9 of them (18%) were hospitalized. 58% of the patients had a travel history to other affected areas. Most travel-associated cases had been returning travelers from Saudi Arabia (55.2%), followed by Malaysia (17.24%).12.24% had close-contact with other patients. The Median duration between developing symptoms and referring to health centers was 3 days (range: 0\u22129 days). Fever was the most common symptom, presented in 95.9% of the cases, followed by cough (85.7%) and myalgia (77.5%). One death was reported. Conclusion: Influenza A (H1N1) v entered Isfahan through travelers, mainly coming from Saudi Arabia. The Majority of the confirmed cases consisted of young adults as reported from other countries.

Case report: An HIV HCV co-infected 35 year old IV drug user presented with fever and general symptoms of fatigue two months after he had successfully completed treatment for right-sided MSSA endocarditis. He had been treated with vancomycin due to serious b-lactam allergic reaction. The patient had a CD4 >800 and undetectable viral load without antiretroviral treatment. Upon admission a new episode of right-sided endocarditis was confirmed and the patient was started on daptomycin 8 mg/kg/day. Enterococcus faecalis was isolated from consecutive blood cultures susceptible to ampicillin, gentamicin, vancomycin and daptomycin (MIC < 0.5mcg/ml). Six days later phenotypic and genotypic (PFGE) identical isolate of E. faecalis continue to be isolated from his blood cultures. The patient was shifted to vancomycin (targeting trough levels >15 mg/L) and serum bactericidal activity of daptomycin and vancomycin were performed according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines. Our results suggested a higher serum bactericidal activity of vancomycin compared to daptomycin, a fact that was confirmed by the clearance of bacteraemia and the full clinical response of our patient. Conclusions: Previous reports have shown the possibility of either emergence of resistance to daptomycin during treatment for enterococcal and MRSA infections or the limited reliability of present breakpoints for the detection of resistance. We believe that in our case the second possibility is the case. Clinicians and microbiologists should be aware of those issues and monitor closely the susceptibilities of isolates. Serum bactericidal activity appears to be a useful test in difficult clinical cases where the expected clinical response is delaying, besides in vitro susceptibility testing.Objective:The mitis group belongs to the oral streptococci, which are commensal bacteria, but sometimes can be involved in the aetiology of serious infections. The aim of the present study was to investigate the antimicrobial susceptibility of 39 mitis group streptococcal strains belonging to: Streptococcus oralis, S. mitis and S. sanguinis species (the last one being included by R. R. Facklam in the sanguinis group), which were isolated from different respiratory tract infections (pneumonia, sepsis of pulmonary origin, peritonsillar abscess, rhinosinusitis, otitis media etc.) in paediatric patients from three hospitals in Bucharest, in 2009. Methods: The susceptibility of the isolates was tested against: penicillin About half of the isolates were resistant to the three b-lactam antibiotics. Only a quarter of the strains were susceptible to EM, while more than 90% and about 60% were sensitive to CM and TC, respectively. Resistance to: PG, AM, CT, EM and TC was found among the strains belonging to the three species, while all S. mitis isolates were susceptible to CM. Conclusion: Since there is a great concern regarding the increased number of oral streptococci resistant to b-lactam antibiotics or multidrugresistant, it is necessary to test the sensitivity of the isolates of clinical importance, especially to the commonly used antibiotics.

Serology is still the most widely used method to diagnose both infections, even if its interpretation is difficult. Objectives: M. and C. pneumoniae serology testing is currently carried out in our institute by microplate analyzer (ETI-Max \u00ae 3000, DiaSorin), used together with Virion M. pneumoniae antibodies assays using native antigens, as well as with Medac total Chlamydia and C. pneumoniae antibodies assays. The objectives of this study are to evaluate Mycoplasma antibody kits using recombinant antigens to improve specificity of results, and to review our current algorithm for Chlamydia serology. Methods: One hundred and fifteen sera were tested with M. pneumoniae antibody kits from Virion, Medac, Savyon and AniLabsystems. Hemagglutination assay was used as reference method to confirm discordant results. Sixty-one sera from 52 patients, including 15 with documented respiratory infection, were tested with C. pneumoniae IgA and IgG kits from Medac, Savyon and Euroimmun. MIF was used as reference method to confirm discordant results. Results: Agreement for at least 3 results or confirmation with hemagglutination assay established reliable diagnosis. Sensitivity was 100%, 100%, 90% and 90% and specificity was 92%, 96%, 100% and 96% for M. pneumoniae IgM from Virion, Medac, Savyon, and AniLabsystems kits respectively. Medac and Savyon M. pneumoniae IgG kits discriminated healthy from sick patients better than did Virion kit; agreement between Medac and Savyon was 89.5%, 91.4% and 81.9% for IgM, IgA and IgG respectively. Sensitivity of Medac, Savyon and Euroimmun C. pneumoniae IgA was 92%, 100%, 59%; accuracy, using MIF as reference test, was 90%, 94% and 67% respectively.

Conclusion: Savyon M. pneumoniae kits show less or no threshold results compared with the 3 other methods. The IgG assay discriminates sick from healthy patients well, with good correlation with the Medac kit. To facilitate interpretation of the results, we decided to perform C. pneumoniae Savyon IgA kit, well correlated with MIF, while Medac C. pneumoniae IgG kit was preferred because of better specificity and quantitative determination.R2228 Initial MIC and disc diffusion quality control ranges for BC-3781 using the CLSI Multi-Laboratory M23-A3 study design J. Ross, R. Jones\u00b0, Z. Ivezic-Schoenfeld, S. Paukner, R. Novak, S. Putnam, H. Sader (North Liberty, US; Vienna, AT) Objectives: To establish the disk diffusion (DD) and MIC quality control (QC) ranges for BC-3205, a novel semi-synthetic pleuromutilin derivative in the early stage clinical development for oral treatment of skin and skin structure infections (SSSI). Methods: These QC studies for the 20-mcg BC-3205 disk and broth microdilution method follow the CLSI M02-A10 (2009), M07-A8 (2009) and M23-A3 (2008) document using eight laboratories, two lots of BC-3205 disks, three or more different medium lots. The results are presented as proposed QC ranges for four ATCC strains: S. aureus ATCC 25923, H. influenzae ATCC 49247, S. pneumoniae ATCC 49619 and S. aureus ATCC 29213 (MIC only). BC-3205 DD and MIC QC ranges were established per a CLSI M23-A3 study design. Ten replicates with each of 3 QC strains produced 1,440 zone diameters for two disk lots of BC-3205 (20-mcg disk) provided by the Mast Group. Clindamycin (CL; 2-mcg disk), azithromycin (AZ; 15-mcg disk) and linezolid (LZ; 30-mcg disk) were utilized as control agents for DD, while retapamulin, AZ and levofloxacin were the control agents for MIC testing. Results: Proposed QC ranges are listed in the Table. No significant differences (>1 mm) were noted between media or disk lots when testing either BC-3205 or control agents. S. aureus ATCC 25923 produced larger variations between laboratories with the most extreme laboratory modes having a 7 mm difference. One laboratory submitted significantly larger zone diameters for H. influenzae ATCC 49247 and was excluded from evaluation leaving seven laboratories for a valid CLSI QC study. MIC values for H. influenzae 49247 showed trailing endpoints of at least one dilution step. One laboratory was excluded from analysis due to outlier values. A 7 mm zone diameter is proposed for S. pneumoniae ATCC 49619 which includes 99.7% of all results. Excluding one aberrant laboratory from the MIC testing analysis produced all seven participant results within the proposed 0.06-0.25 mg/L range. All but one MIC result for the control agents were within expected ranges, when applicable. The control disks (LZ, AZ, CL) provided a valid internal control for the study, with 97.7 to 100.0% of zones within CLSI published QC ranges. Conclusions: An acceptable QC range was established for the four QC organisms that will guide clinical and reference laboratories involved in clinical trials and facilitate the regulatory review process of BC-3205. One laboratory was excluded from analysis, H. influenzae QC range for MIC tests was not acceptable. NA = Not applicable.

In this comparative study, four chromogenic media, CHROMagar Candida (CAC) (CHROMagar, France), Albicans ID2 agar (AID) (bioM\u00e9rieux, France), Candiselect medium (CS) (Biorad, France) and chromID Candida Agar (CAN2) (bioM\u00e9rieux, France) were evaluated for the presumptive identification of yeasts. Methods: Totally 125 clinical yeast isolates, 62 Candida albicans, 18 C. tropicalis, 17 C. glabrata, 13 C. parapsilosis, five C. krusei, five Trichosporon spp., three C. kefyr, one C. guilliermondii and one Geotrichum candidum were included in the study. The isolates were identified by germ tube test, morphological characteristics on corn meal tween 80 agar and API 20 C AUX system. The isolates were cultured to Sabouraud dextrose agar from stock cultures and after 48 hours streaked onto CAC, AID, CS and CAN2 plates. The plates were evaluated by considering the colour, texture of the colonies and the existence of halo around the colony by three different people after 24, 48 and 72 hours of incubation at 37\u00baC in the dark.

Quentin (Tours, FR; Bremen, DE; Wissembourg, FR)    Objectives: Streptococcus agalactiae is the main cause of neonatal infections and an increasingly frequent pathogen also in non-pregnant humans. A large number of different Sequence Types (STs) distributed over several major phylogenetic lineages or clonal complexes (CC) have been identified by multilocus sequence typing (MLST). STs 17 and 19 account for the majority of cases of S. agalactiae meningitis in infants while CCs 1, 12, 17, 19 and 23 are mostly associated with infections in adults. The presented study intends to investigate if MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry profiling (i) is suited for secure species identification of S. agalactiae and (ii) can also be used for analysis on the subspecies level. Methods: 197 S. agalactiae strains characterized by MLST were analysed by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Data processing was performed using the MALDI Biotyper 2.0 software (Bruker Daltonics, Germany). Mass spectra of each strain were compared with the mass spectra stored in the MALDI Biotyper database. To improve the database, new entries from different clonal complexes were created and introduced into the library. Further, to investigate subspecies variability, the spectra sets of isolates from different STs were investigated using the ClinProTools 2.0 and FlexAnalysis 3.0 (Bruker Daltonics, Germany) software to find characteristic markers for the different subtypes. Results: MALDI-TOF MS correctly identified all the 110 S. agalactiae isolates of a first set at the species level with good [log(score) >2.0] to very good [log(score) >2.3] confidence. By introducing further references into the database characteristic for the major sequence types (ST1, ST10, ST17, ST19, and ST23), the identification results could be further improved [about 99% log(score) >2.3].

Despite the availability of molecular diagnostic methods, detection of antibodies against CP and MP is a mainstay of diagnosis, especially in outpatients. We performed a laboratory-based multicenter surveillance in Germany to determine the prevalence of antibodies against CP and MP, detect seasonal variations, and age-dependent differences in seroprevalence. Materials and Methods: Results of IgM, IgA, and IgG antibodies against CP and MP, determined by ELISA (medac, Wedel, Germany) were evaluated in 16,039 patients (55% female, 45% male, 0\u221296 years) in three medical laboratories located in North and South Germany. All serum samples submitted to the laboratories for CP and MP serology between June 2008 and May 2009 were included. Results: The total seroprevalence indicating infection with CP and MP was 68% and 31%, respectively. The prevalence of CP infection increased with the age of patients (up to 85% above 90 years). Acute CP infection was determined in 9% of all patients respectively 13% of the seropositive patients and occurred predominantly in the age group of 1\u221210 years. Seroprevalence of acute infection showed peak rates between September and December. In contrast, past CP infection (52%) and current but inconspicuous findings (35%) in seropositive patients did not show seasonal variation. The prevalence of MP infection increased up to 50% between 16 and 30 years and declined with increasing age. Acute MP infection was determined in 4% of all patients respectively 12% of seropositive patients and occurred predominantly in the age group of 1\u221210 years. Seroprevalence of acute infection showed peak rates between November and December. Past MP infection was found in 75% and current findings in 13% of seropositive patients without seasonal variation. Serological evidence of acute coinfection with CP and MP occurred in less than 1% of patients. Conclusion: According to our serological data, acute infection by CP and MP both occur all-season with a predilection in winter period. The prevalence of CP infections is increasing with age. In contrast MP infections decline in older population. The prevalence of acute CP and MP infections in our surveillance is comparable to results of international studies.R2233 Detection of IgG antibodies to herpes simplex virus type 1 and 2 in various HIV-positive African populations by the BioPlex 2200 multiplexing immunoassay platform J.

The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of the Roche CMV IgG and IgM immunoassays with the Beckman Coulter, bioM\u00e9rieux and Siemens assays using specifically selected patient samples. We focused on sample results in the intermediate range (grey zone) as determined by Vidas. Methods: CMV IgG and IgM determination was performed on Access (Beckman coulter), Immulite (Siemens), Modular (Roche) and Vidas (bioM\u00e9rieux) using 71 patient sera. We selected similar quantities of sera in the negative, the doubtful, the weakly positive (defined as positive <2\u00d7 cut-off) and positive reference interval, determined by our routine method (Vidas). Relative agreement was calculated as the number of concordant samples/number of all tested samples (grey zone results considered as positive). The correlation between positive sera was calculated as number of concordant positive samples/number of samples tested positive by one method (grey zone results not taken into account). Results: The relative agreement (%) for CMV IgG/IgM between Modular on one hand and Access or Immulite or Vidas on the other hand was respectively 94/83, 79/68 and 91/79. The correlation (%)between positive sera for IgG/IgM between Modular and Access or Immulite or Vidas was respectively 94/81, 76/61 and 88/87. For both assays, 79% of positive samples on Modular were positive with all methods. For IgG/IgM respectively 0/0, 3/5, 1/0 and 9/5 samples were exclusively reactive on Access, Immulite, Modular and Vidas. For IgG/IgM respectively 2/3, 7/4, 2/6 and 1/0 samples were exclusively negative on Access, Immulite, Modular and Vidas. From the selected 28 samples with doubtful or weakly positive result on Vidas, respectively 6, 3 and 5 remained doubtful or weakly positive for Access, Immulite and Modular(table 1). Conclusion: Using selected patient samples, based on Vidas results, the relative agreement for both IgG and IgM assays is the greatest between Modular and Access. The amount of results in the grey zone is similar for Access, Immulite and Modular. The limited amount of sera that are exclusively reactive on Modular supports a good specificity, similar to the Access.Table 1.

We also evaluated the three techniques on 7 seroconversion panels. Methods: 286 retrospective samples from outpatients were tested with the 3 methods. The sample status was determined according to the Bioplex 2200 reagent (Biorad) routinely used in our laboratory. The samples consisted of 95 acute infections (AI), 97 negative patients (Neg) and 94 past infections (PI). Seven seroconversion panels characterized by Enzygnost EBV IgG/IgM and BMD EBNA IgG reagents were tested with the 3 methods. Results: The sensitivity obtained on AI for VIDAS VCA IgM, IMMULITE VCA IgM and LIAISON VCA IgM was 100%, 74.2% and 100% respectively; the specificity on Neg was 100% for all reagents, and the specificity on PI was 94.4%, 96.7% and 96.6% respectively. The sensitivity on PI for VIDAS VCA IgG, IMMULITE VCA IgG and LIAISON VCA IgG was 98.9%, 97.9%, 98.9%. Concerning primoinfections, among 95 samples, only 38 samples were detected VCA/EA IgG >0 with the Bioplex technique considered as the reference method. Therefore, reporting VCA IgG relative sensitivity results was not considered. The specificity was 100% on Neg for VIDAS and LIAISON and 93.75% for IMMULITE. The sensitivity on PI for VIDAS EBNA IgG, IMMULITE EBNA IgG and LIAISON EBNA IgG was 98.9%, 100%, 100% respectively, the specificity on Neg was 100%, 97.9% and 98.9% respectively, and the specificity on AI was 95.6%, 91.4% and 98.7% respectively. Concordance to clinical status is as follows: VIDAS EBV: 100% on Neg, 100% on AI and 98.8% on PI. IMMULITE EBV: 94.7% on Neg, 75.9% on AI and 97.7% on PI. LIAISON EBV: 100% on Neg, 100% on AI and 100% on PI. The seroconversion panels did not show any delay in IgM detection with the 3 methods compared with the reference method. Conclusion: VIDAS and LIAISON showed good performance in terms of sensitivity and specificity. Concordance with the reference status was highly acceptable. IMMULITE showed poor VCA IgM sensitivity and EBNA IgG specificity results in the primary infections group, leading to poor concordance with the reference status. A high number of equivocal results were obtained with LIAISON EBNA IgG. In conclusion, VIDAS appears to be a very reliable automated method for EBV serology.

The rapid test that detect toxin A+B are a alternative to convencional culture. Recently, a rapid membrane enzyme immunoassay has been developed for the simultaneous detection of toxins A+B and glutamate dehydrogenase antigen (GDH), a C. difficile specific enzyme. Objectives: The aim of this study was to compare a new rapid membrane enzyme immunoassay (method 1) and an immunochromatographic assay (method 2) for the diagnosis of Clostridium difficile infection from clinical specimens. The samples with discordant results between both assays were analyzed by a third method, a commercial real time PCR technique that detects toxin B gene.

Methods: -The first experiment was a coculture of A. castellanii (ATCC 30234) or A. culbertsoni (ATCC 30171) trophozoites and A. baumannii in PBS at 27\u00baC. After 24, 48 or 72 h, the cocultures were plated on Mueller Hinton medium to count CFU. Controls were realized by incubating bacteria in the same conditions without amoebae. -The same experiment was then conducted, but after 24 h, the cocultures were transferred in encystment medium, and CFU of In the coculture experiments realized in PBS at 27\u00baC, the presence of A. castellanii or A. culbertsoni induced a major increase in A. baumannii growth, compared to the control. -Concerning the incubation in encystment medium after 24 h of coculture, the results showed a marked persistance of the viability of A. baumannii in the presence of Acanthamoeba. The electron microscopy showed internalized bacteria in trophozoites after 24 h of coculture. After 10 days in encystment medium, bacteria were found within cyst wall. Conclusion: Under certain conditions, the survival and growth of A. baumannii is favored by Acanthamoeba strains. So, in hospital water systems, a special attention should be paid to the presence of free living amoebae, which can promote A. baumannii growth.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF43": {"text": "Partial acetylation of ST significantly reduced its germination potential compared to non-acetylation of the compound (P < 0.05).

Nadji\u00b0, S. Ehteshamiafshar, P. Tabarsi, D. Mansouri  (Tehran, IR)    Objectives: Coexistence of tuberculosis (TB) in human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis C virus (HIV-HCV) co-infected patients, is a unique clinical and public health challenges. Medications for treatment of TB, HIV and HCV are hepatotoxic. So this condition made us to determine prevalence, risk factors and factors that may predispose for anti-tuberculosis therapy induced hepatoxicity. Methods: In a retrospective study medical records of all hospitalized HIV-HCV co-infected patients from January 2001 to December 2009 at the National Research Institute of Tuberculosis and Lung Disease (NRITLD) were reviewed. A standardized case record form was applied to collect demographic, clinical, laboratory and microbiologic data. Patients with coexisting TB were identified as a case group and patients who were not infected with TB considered as the control group. Presenting signs and symptoms, and co-morbidities and widespread lab data (including biochemical, haematologic and serologic assay) in both groups were measured. Results: 126 HIV-HCV co-infected patients (all of them were smoker males, 25.5% jobless, 47.7%single, 43.1%Married, 9.2% divorced, 80% IVDU, 84.6% opium user, 13.8% HBsAg+, 84.6% imprison and 12.3% in hospital mortality) were recruited in this study.60 out of them had coexisting TB. Significant statistical differences were seen in marital status, hospitalization length, CD4 count, clinical sings and symptoms (cough, sputum, fever, weight loss) microcytic anemia, ESR and CRP between TB and non-TB groups.R2334 Efficacy and safety of topical acyclovir/hydrocortisone 1% formulation for the treatment of recurrent labial herpes simplex in adolescentsN. Petrochenkova\u00b0, O. Sivaya (Smolensk, RU)Objective: To investigate efficacy and safety of topical acyclovir / hydrocortisone 1% formulation for the treatment of recurrent labial herpes simplex in adolescents. Methods: Non-immunocompromised subjects 12\u221217 years old who had more than 2 episodes of recurrent labial herpes during the previous 12 months were eligible. Patients were not allowed to use systemic or topical antivirals and steroid agents two weeks prior and during the study drug treatment period. The study drug was administered for the new episode of labial herpes simplex and was applied 5 times per day for 5 days. Clinical assessment was performed daily for 5 days, 1 week, 3\u00b11 weeks and 6 months after the last dose of the study drug.Results: A total of 22 patients (11 boys and 11 girls) were treated with the study drug. The labial herpes simplex recurrence rate during the last year in most patients varied from 4 to 8 times, one patient had 12 relapses during the previous year. During the new episode of labial herpes simplex all patients noted disappearance of clinical symptoms (pain, burning) on the second day of the study treatment. Eighteen of 22 subjects had nonulcerative herpetic lesions \u2212 the process stopped on papule stage. In most patients (12 persons) the symptoms of relapse resolved on the forth day, in 5 persons \u2212 on the fifths day, and in one person \u2212 on the sixths day.The skin was normal during the first week and 3\u00b11 weeks after the last dose of the study medication in all patients. Four patients have been diagnosed a recurrence of herpes leading to development of a lesion with vesicle, ulcer and hard crust. They had hard crust stage of labial herpes simplex on the end of treatment period. On the first week after last dose of study drug there were determined residual abnormalities in those patients and the normal skin was fixed on 3\u00b11 week visit. None subjects had adverse events related with the study drug. Phone contact was performed post 6 months after last dose of the study drug and all of treated patients had no recurrence labial herpes during the period. Conclusions: Topical acyclovir/1% hydrocortisone showed good efficacy for the treatment of recurrent labial herpes simplex. All patients noted quick resolving of symptoms (pain, burning). Application of the drug stopped the recurrence process on the papule stage. There were no adverse events due to study drug.R2335 InfluenzaA H1N1: Shell vial culture vs. PCR E.M. Gonzalez Barbera\u00b0, B. Acosta Boga, G. Fagundez Machain, J.M. Molina Moreno, M. Gobernado Serrano (Valencia, ES)In the beginning of the H1N1 Influenzavirus pandemia, we started working with PCR, culture and antigen detection (the last was refused due to its low sensibility), but culture was performed in certain circumstances like immunocompromised or admitted in Intensive Care Units patients.Objectives: To compare shell-vial culture and PCR for Influenza AH1N1 detection considering PCR as \"gold standard\". Methods: 214 samples were processed during the period April-November 2009 by PCR [AgPath-ID\u2122One-Step RT-PCR Kit (Ambion Applied Biosystem), artus \u00ae Influenza/H1 LC/RG RT-PCR-Kit (Qiagen)] and cultured in MDCK cell line shell-vial (Vircell\u2122) with Trypsine, incubated at 35\u221237\u00baC for 24 or 48 hours, and stained with monoclonal antibody against respiratory viruses, including Influenza A (Chemi-con\u2122). Results: See Table 1. We also observed that 24 hours of incubation are enough and correlates with 50\u221275% cell monolayer infection (detected by monoclonal antibody stain). Conclusion: MDCK cell line is an adequate cell line for Influenzavirus H1N1 isolation and Influenza A monoclonal antibody stain identifies it correctly in a pandemic situation (without distinguish between virus subtypes). We consider that virus isolation is necessary for later studies. Furthermore, we may identify other viruses when we are not looking for them on purpose or in samples not considered at first. Table 1. Culture and PCR comparison results R2336 The usefulness of IgG avidity for determining primary cytomegalovirus infection in pregnant women C. Karachristou\u00b0, A. Armelidou, V. Dinopoulou, M. Traki, I. Minopoulos (Athens, Alimos, GR) Objectives: The diagnosis of infection with human cytomegalovirus remains difficult on symptoms alone as many of them are mild and asymptomatic. Primary CMV infection in early pregnancy bears a high risk of fetal damage. The prenatal diagnosis of CMV has focused on first-trimester screening since the time of maternal CMV infection is an important variable and the rate of transmission from mother to fetus is much higher. If fetal infection occurs earlier in gestation, it appears to present a greater threat to the fetus. Methods: 8.768 pregnant women in the first trimester of the pregnancy were tested for CMV during the last 18 months May 2008 \u2212 Oct 2009 in \"Mitera\" general, maternity & children hospital. Women were aged between 23 and 44 (mean age 33.5 years). Samples positive for CMV IgG were tested farther for IgM antibodies. Finally samples positive in both CMV IgG and IgM antibodies were farther tested for CMV IgG avidity. All tests were performed by chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay (CMIA, Abbott Park, US).Results: Of the 8.768 women tested, 3.558 (40.6%) had never been infected with CMV, 5.082 (58.0%) found to be positive in CMV IgG and negative in IgM. 117 (1.3%) samples found to be positive in both CMV IgG and IgM and 11 (0.1%) were in the CMV IgM grayzone. Of the 117 positive samples, 23 (19.7%) had a low avidity and 93 (79.5%) had a high avidity. One sample (0.8%) was in the grayzone. All samples with CMV IgM in the grayzone had high avidity. Conclusions: Measurement of CMV IgG avidity may help to improve the serodiagnosis of CMV infected women by determining the time of infection. The presence of high avidity indicates that primary infection occurred well before conception and the fetus is most likely protected against debilitating CMV infection. This information is important in the clinical management of pregnant women found to be positive for CMV antibodies at their first-trimester of gestation when the risk of fetal damage is greater.R2337 Patients with 2009 influenza A/H1N1 virus in a tertiaryhospital in Spain, April-October 2009 G.

Gobernado (Valencia, ES) Background: During the first weeks of April 2009 North America and Mexico detected the initial cases of a novel swine-origin Influenza A/H1N1 virus: a triple-reassortant Influenza A virus. This was quickly followed by detection in other countries and by the end of April, the virus had spread to over 123 countries. Methods: Using medical charts, we collected data on 212 patients who were attended for influenza-like illness (fever, cough, sore throat) in our Hospital and who tested positive for the 2009 H1N1 virus; we regarded age, hospitalization (at least 24 hs), and underlying diseases. Two types of real-time reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain-reaction assays, were used; Influenza RT-PCR Kit RUO (Artus) as a screening test and a confirmatory RT-PCR (Applied Biosystems \u2122), according to the CDC protocol. Results: Of the 190 patients for whom data were available, 134 (70.5%) were admitted to the domiciliary hospitalization unit, 55 (28.9%) were hospitalized (median age 27.07, range 2\u221285), 4 (2.1%) were admitted to an intensive care unit (median age 30, range 14\u221251), and 2 (1.05%) died (median age 18.5 range 14\u221223): 110 (57.8%) were adult patients, between 18 and 65 years of age, 74 (38.9%) were children under the age of 18 years, and 5 (2.6%) were adults 65 years of age or older. 80 (42.1%) of the patients had at least one underlying medical condition; asthma; diabetes; heart, lung disease, obesity and pregnancy, considered risk factors for severe disease 26 (13.6%), had recently traveled to Mexico. (including the first reported case at the Valencian Community) 21 (38.9%) of the 55 hospitalized patients and 1 of the 4 (7.2%) admitted to an intensive care unit patients did not have any risk factors for severe illness. Conclusions: During the evaluation period, 212 patients tested positive for the 2009 A/H1N1 Influenza. More than 95% of the affected patients were under 65 years; 55 (29.1%) patients required hospitalization because of severe illness. 21 (38.9%) of these hospitalized patients as well as 1 of the ICU admitted patients, did not have any risk factors for severe illness. It's seems to be important to continue advancing in the knowledge of the pathogenicity of this microorganism.

Keske, D. Yapar, T. Arslan, M.A. Tasyaran (Ankara, TR)    Introduction: Crimean Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is a disease caused by CCHF virus of family Bunyaviridae and transmitted to humans generally by Hyalomma tick bites or by direct contact with blood or other excretes of infected humans. There has been annual increases in case numbers in Turkey since 2002. Materials and Methods: From April 2007 to September 2009 CCHF virus ELISA and/or RT-PCR confirmed cases in Ankara Ataturk Education and Research Hospital were included in the study. All the informations of the patients have been provided from patient charts. Results: From 2007 to 2009, 94 comfirmed cases were hospitalized in our hospital. Female to male ratio was 1.14. Median age was 49 (15\u221276 years) years. 93% of the cases were from rural areas. 74% of patients had tick bite or contact history. Of these 94 patients one (1.06%) was nosocomial infection. The most seen clinical complaints were malaise (90%), fever (85%) and myalgia (81%). Cholecystitis were seen in 6 patients (6.4%). The mean hospitalization duration was 10 (1\u221262 days) days. Mortality rate was 6.4% (6/94). Ribavirin treatment were administered at 26 patients and also supportive treatment to all patients. Discussion: CCHF is a big seasonal health problem for Turkey with increasing cases annually. The main risk factor for transmission of disease is mostly tick bite. The cholecystitis seems to be a new defined clinical finding in CCHF. There is not a specific treatment for CCHF; efficacy of ribavirin treatment is controversial. The mortality rate was similiar with those reported in literature from Turkey.R2341 Assessment of serological markers for Epstein-Barr virus in patients for transplantationP.Genova-Kalou\u00b0, G. Ivanova, A. Toshev (Sofia, BG)    Objectives: Viral infections constitute the single greatest cause of infectious-disease related morbidity and mortality in organ transplant recipients. Cytomegalovirus (CMV), which frequently causes latent asymptomatic infection in healthy adults, may evade immune surveillance in immune compromised patients, as well as in renal transplant recipients and to start to replicate. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection sometimes results in clinical symptoms (fever, leucopenia, pharyngitis, hepatitis, lymphadenopathy) and eventually may lead to uncontrolled proliferation of B cells terminating in post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD). The risk of PTLD is mostly determined by the prevalence of anti-EBV sero-positivity in transplanted patients.Methods: This prompted us to investigate the serum samples submitted to our laboratory from 25 post transplanted patients (18-35 years old) and 30 healthy blood donors (20-42 years old). Serum samples were collected from all patients before transplantation and at three months after transplantation. Sera were stored at \u221270\u00baC. The samples were tested for EBV-and CMV-specific serology, including VCA IgM, VCA IgG, early antigen (EA) and EBNA antibody. The levels of antibodies were determined using commercially available sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method.Results: Antibody avidity test results were added to provide an expanded serological profile in which patients with low antibody affinity were defined as having primary infections while those with high antibody affinity were regarded as having past infections. 25 samples (48.2%) were found to be seropositive. Recent infection was diagnosed in 32.6% of patients while prior infection in 15.6%. Past infection was diagnosed by detecting VCA IgM antibodies in 20.5% of the examined samples. Our results confirm the thesis that VCA IgM in the absence of antibody to EB nuclear antigen (EBNA) is regarded as suggestive of acute primary EBV infection because EBNA antibodies develop only in late convalescence.Conclusions:In conclusion, specific serological anti-EBV IgG markers (EBNA and EA) must be used for the serological diagnosis of EBV infectious mononucleosis. In order to obtain the highest sensitivity, VCA IgM, VCA IgG, EBNA and EA antibodies need to be measured.R2342 Unusual nosocomial transmission of Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever; two cases report from TurkeyN.Tulek\u00b0, C.

Bachiyska\u00b0, A. Ivanova, D. Merdjanov, T. Kantardjiev, E. Borrone, P. Miotto, D. Cirillo (Sofia, BG; Milan, IT) Background: The rate of MDR TB in Bulgaria continue to be high (WHO, 2009). Here we report about results of a first study on the MDR TB strains from the clinical isolates in 2008 in the country. Methods: The study panel included 26 MDR TB strains isolated from new and retreated patients from all over the country. MGIT 960 \u00ae first and second line drugs and Geno Type MTBDR plus \u00ae were used to strain characterization. Results: A collection of 26 strains shoved a phenotypical resistance at least to INH and RMP by MGIT 960 \u00ae . MDR TB strains were confirmed as: 9 resistant to STR, INH, RMP and EMB; 9 to STR, INH and RMP; 3 to INH, RMP and EMB; 5 to INH and RMP. All the MDRTB strains were retested by Geno Type MTBDR plus \u00ae and were INH and RMP resistant. Second line drugs testing shoved only one strain resistant to OFL. All others 25 MDRTB strains were fully susceptible to OFL, AMK, KNM, CAP. Conclusion: Using the classical methods was confirmed that no XDR TB cases was found in last year in Bulgaria.

Results: T. cruzi reactivation was detected in 10 patients HIV positive and two HIV negative immunocompromised by chemoterapy or transplants, 91.7% (11/12) T. cruzi II and 8.3% (1/12) T. cruzi V. Parasite kDNA showed high variability, but identical genetic profiles in blood and CNS fluid from a same patient. These populations were clustered in to three branches, two with 72.7% of isolates and low LTCD4+ counts (42.0 cells/mm 3 ) and the other with 27.3% of samples and 158.0 cells/mm 3 . Among the 29 HIV co-infected patients not reactivated the T. cruzi I was detected in 6.9% (2/29); T. cruzi II in 86.2%(25/29) and T. cruzi V in 6.9% (2/29). In 50 HIV negative patients, T. cruzi I was found in 4% (2/50), T. cruzi II in 94% (47/50) and T. cruzi V in 2.0% (1/50). Conclusions: There was no difference in the distribution of T. cruzi groups among HIV positive and HIV negative patients (fischer test p = 0.7791), or between HIV reactivated and not reactivated patients (fischer test p = 0.8281) or associated with blood and/or CNS invasi\u00f3n in reactived patients.

Diagnostic tests for hepatitis C include serological assays that detect antibodies to hepatitis C virus (anti-HCV). Various automated immunoassays are widely used in clinical laboratories in order to detect anti-HCV. The aim of this study is to compare the sensitivity and specificity of three different immunoassays for the detection of HCV antibodies. Methods: Sera were obtained from 320 adult patients (both sexes, aged 25 to 75 years old) of unknown serological status. All samples were screened for anti-HCV using Chemiluminescent Microparticle Immunoassay (CMIA), Microparticle Enzyme Immunoassay (MEIA) and Electrochemiluminescence Immunoassay (ECLIA). Architect i2000SR (Abbott), Axsym Plus (Abbott), and Elecsys 2010 (Roche) were the automated analyzers used respectively. Prevalences were calculated according to S/CO ratio. Any positive or dubious (low S/CO ratio) result was confirmed using the Line Immunoassay INNO-LIA HCV. Results: Among the 320 samples tested, 18 were found to be positive for anti-HCV by all three methods (S/CO > 200 for ECLIA, S/CO > 10 for MEIA and S/CO > 5 for CMIA). The positive samples were subsequently tested using INNO-LIA and were all confirmed showing 100% sensitivity for all three assays. Moreover, 6 samples were found positive with a low S/CO ratio by ECLIA and CMIA (S/CO < 200 for ECLIA and S/CO < 5 for CMIA) and 4 of them were also found positive with a low S/CO ratio by MEIA (S/CO < 10).

The individual MICs of the isolates studied were evaluated with the proportional method in 7H11 solid medium. The above combinations were studied crossing 7 concentrations of each antibiotic (corresponding to their MIC, two greater and four lesser dilutions), with a 2-dimensional chequerboard assay and an adaptation to a 3-antibiotic chequerboard assay in 7H11 medium. After analysing the results of all the combinations, the fractional inhibitory concentration (FIC) was calculated. Two-dimensional chequerboard assay: the FIC was calculated as FIC index=MICA in combination/MICA alone+MICB in combination/MICB alone where A and B were the two respective antimicrobial agents tested. The FIC index was interpreted as FIC index 0.5, synergistic activity, FIC > 0.5\u22124, indifference and FIC > 4 antagonistic activity.

Pneumonia was the main manifestation with fever and productive cough being the presenting complaints. Two patients developed the infections while being treated for underlying pulmonary tuberculosis while another two patients had underlying histoplasmosis. Chest radiographs revealed consolidation (without lobar predilection) and in half of the cases, cavitations were seen. Pleural effusion was not present in any of the cases. The average CD4 lymphocyte count at the time of presentation was 10 cells/ml. All the patients were treated with a combination of vancomycin plus either imipenem or erythromycin. No mortality was seen. Conclusion: Our observation underlines the importance to suspect R. equi pneumonia in patients with HIV who have low CD4 lymphocytes count (<20 cells//ml) and presence of lung cavities on chest radiograph. The microbiology laboratory plays an important role in the diagnosis of R. equi infection as its diagnosis ultimately relies on the isolation of the organism. A prompt identification and notification helps in the management of the patient. Objectives: Community-acquired methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) is well recognised as an important pathogen that causes predominantly skin and soft-tissue infections and infrequently life-threatening infections, mostly among children. Vancomycin (VA) is the drug of choice for the treatment of these infections. We describe the isolation of a CA-MRSA with intermediate resistance to VA from a 4-year old girl admitted to the hospital with sepsis and severe multifocal infections including pericarditis, pleural effusions, septic arthritis and osteomyelitis. She was initially treated with combination of VA and clindamycin and had a long complicated course. Methods: Three CA-MRSA strains were isolated from blood, wound and pericardial pus. Bacterial identification and initial susceptibility testing was performed with the VITEK2 automated system. MICs of vancomycin, teicoplanin, erythromycin, clindamycin, daptomycin, linezolid and tigecycline were determined by E-test. All isolates were subjected to PCR in order to identify the presence of Staphylococcal Cassette Chromosome type IV (SCCmecIV), Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) and Van A and B genes. According to the updated CLSI and EUCAST interpretive criteria the isolates recovered from blood and wound fluid are considered as VISA. All isolates carried SCCmecIV and PVL genes. No isolate was positive for Van genes. Conclusions: The emergence of VISA in CA-MRSA is of great concern. These isolates are not easily detected with routine laboratory antimicrobial testing. As outcome of severe staphylococcal infections depends on the rapid and appropriate therapy, investigation for the presence of VISA in cases of CA-MRSA infections is warranted. HBoV in 306 of 2189 children (14.0%). Detection frequency of these viruses fluctuated during different years of investigation from 8.3% till 14.2% for HMPV and from 9.6% till 17.0% for HBoV. The presence of viruses in population was registered during all calendar year. The highest detection of these viruses was occurred between March and June, and between September and December. A majority of children who was positive for HMPV were aged <12 months and for HBoV were aged from 1 to 3 years. New viruses were detected in patients with both upper and lower respiratory tract illnesses. HMPV was associated predominately with pneumonia (29%), bronchitis (29%), bronchiolitis (16.7%), croup (14%), and, and HBoV \u2212 with croup (19%). Clinical symptoms of HMPV infection such as rhinorrhea, cough, wheezing and fever are similar to those of respiratory syncitial viral infection. The most severe course was observed among children aged up to 6 months. The duration of HMPV infection was 3\u221220 days. HBoV infection is clinically similar to typical acute respiratory viral infections, however, in the most cases it resulted in obstructive syndrome evolution and was frequently characterized by dyspepsia. The duration of HBoV infection was 3\u221216 days. Conclusions: HMPV and HBoV are the important cause of acute respiratory infections in hospitalized children in Russia. HMPV and HBoV circulate in Moscow (Russia) during all calendar year and have seasonal peaks. Morbidity peak of these viral infections is observed twice a year. These viruses are more frequently detected among children aged up to 3 years.

The aim of this study is to record the most frequent microorganisms isolated from wound infections of children who were examined or hospitalized in a paediatric hospital in Western Greece. Methods: A total of 991 clinical samples were collected from children 0\u221215 years old, during a two year period (2007) (2008) (2009) . The samples were cultured in the conventional growth materials. Isolates were identified at species level by conventional tests and the antibiotic susceptibility by the disk diffusion method (Kirby-Bauer), according to the guidelines of CLSI. Results: From the 991 cultures, 553 (55.8%) were positive for microbial etiologic agents. The most commonly isolated microorganisms, according to their frequency were: S. aureus 373 strains (67.4%), CNS (coagulase-negative staphylococci) 55 strains (9.9%), S. pyogenes 34 strains (6.1%), P. aeruginosa 23 strains (4.1%) and E.Coli 20 strains (3.6%). From the 55 CNS, 20 (36.36%) were considered to be contaminations, based on the patient's symptoms and clinical history. From the 373 S. aureus strains, 212 strains (56.8%) were methicillin resistant (MRSA), and 122 of them (57.5%) were collected from children hospitalized in the orthopaedic, surgical or paediatric clinic, whereas 90 strains (42.5%) were community-acquired. Conclusions: S. aureus seems to be the most common cause of wound infections in children. It is worth to mention the high percentage of methicillin-resistant strains (MRSA-56.8%), as well as their prevalence in hospitalized patients in comparison to those of the community. Among the Gram(\u2212) microorganisms, there is a prevalence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa, which was isolated in 23 cases (4.1%), mainly from ear secretions. C.S. Cambrea\u00b0, S. Halichidis, M.

Marcas (Constanta, RO) Background: The disease caused by Rickettsia conorii is known by various geographically recognized names, including Mediterranean spotted fever, boutonneuse fever, Kenya tick typhus, Indian tick typhus, Israeli spotted fever, and Astrakhan fever. It is a moderately severe vasculotropic rickettsiosis that is often initially associated with an eschar at the site of the tick bite. Objective: Retrospective analysis of 63 children and 18 adolescents hospitalized with boutonneuse fever in Children Infectious Diseases Clinic of Clinical Infectious Diseases Hospital of Constanta. Material and Method: Retrospective analysis of boutonneuse fever hospitalized in Children Infectious Diseases Department during a period of 6 years (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) (2007) (2008) . We evaluate demographic, clinic, serologic and therapeutic data. Results: During a period of 6 years (January 2003 -December 2008 in Children Infectious Diseases Department we followed 81 cases of boutonneuse fever. From the total of cases 61.27% were from urban area, 53.08% were male. The majority of cases were registered in warm season. The eschar (tache noir) was present in 56 patients. Fever had a 6 days mean duration and disappears often in first 3\u22124 days of etiologic treatment. Maculopapular rash with nodular boutonneuse lesions was detected in 72 cases, 5 having petechial lesions. Only 34 children had leucocytosis, 9 with thrombocytopenia.

Clinical signs are often nonspecific, thus, its diagnosis is made by specific serology, such as ELISA and Western blot (WB). The serological diagnosis remains the main tool for the diagnosis of toxocariasis. The objectives of our study was to determine the frequency and distribution of toxocara seroprevalence in the paediatric population. Methods: From January to October 2008, a total of 267 sera were collected from children with asymptomatic for toxocariasis (mean age, 8.5\u00b12.3 years, range: 4\u221216 years). Eosinophilia counts were performed by using automatic blood cell counter (Kell-dyn 3500). Toxocara seroprevalence was measured with ELISA IgG kit (CELISA, Cellabs, Australia). In cases where negative or low-positive values obtained by ELISA, the results were confirmed by WB (LDBIO, France). Results: The sera of 78 people of 267 asymptomatic individuals were found to be positive for Toxocara IgG antibody (29.21%). Seropositivity rapidly increased by age reaching 25.65% at the age of 12\u221216 years. The borderline anti-Toxocara IgG ELISA results were positive with WB. A significantly higher percentage (26%, P = 0.01) of Toxocara seropositivity was found in children with eosinophilia when compared with 13% seropositivity measured in children without eosinophilia. The borderline anti-Toxocara IgG ELISA results were positive with WB. Conclusions: The highest positivity (18.11%) were found mostly underdeveloped regions and the lowest positivity (11.10%) were found in and around the center of the city. Probably, this reflects the differences in hygienic conditions. The Toxocara seroprevalence rapidly increasing with aging within the age limits of this study. This can be explained by the frequent contact of children with contaminated soil. A significantly higher percentage of Toxocara seropositivity was found with eosinophilia compared with the asymptomatic children. The western blot technique was very useful in confirming the borderline and negative anti-Toxocara IgG values obtained by ELISA method. Results: Seventy nine strains (89.6%) were included in the 23 valent vaccine (VP23V) and 15 (19.5%) were included in the 7 valent vaccine. Four serotypes were the most frequently found in our strains: 7F (14.3%), 22F (11.7%), 3(10.4%) and 1 (6.5%). The thirteen valent conjugate vaccine confers efficacy against four of these serotypes (7F, 3, 19A and 1). The percentages of no susceptibility to penicillin and cefotaxime and resistant to erithromicin and levofloxain were 2.6%, 3.9%, 19.5% and 0%, respectively. Strains no susceptibility to penicillin or cefotaxime were included in the serotypes 14 and 6B. Thirty three percentage of erithromicin resistant strains were included in the serotype 19 A. Conclusions: Serotypes most frequent found (7F, 22F, 3, 19A and 1), are included in the VP23 vaccine but no in VC7 vaccine. The thirteen valent conjugate vaccine confers efficacy against four of these serotypes (7F, 3, 19A and 1).

Methods: Clinical isolates were obtained from 84 children, aged 4 months to 8 years, between March and October 2009. Vaccination with 7-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7) was considered appropriate if it was done according to the following scheme: a three-dose series if starting vaccination at 12 months of age; a two-dose series if starting vaccination at 12-24 months of age; and one-dose series if starting vaccination at 24 months of age. Streptococcus pneumoniae strains were collected from the following clinical cases: acute otitis media (69.0%), pneumonia (14.3%), sepsis (7.1%), conjunctivitis (2.4%), acute tracheitis (2.4%), acute sinusitis (1.2%), acute tonsillitis (1.2%), bronchiectasis (1.2%). Antimicrobial susceptibility of all isolates was tested by the disk diffusion method in accordance with the guidelines of CLSI, against erythromycin, clindamycin, vancomycin. Penicillin and ceftriaxone MICs were determined by E-test. Pneumococci were serotyped by primer specific PCR. Results: Of 84 children, 73 (87.0%) were vaccinated with PCV7, 9 (10.7%) were not vaccinated, 2 (2.3%) dropped-out. Of 84 strains, 61 (72.6%) were serotyped and 4 of them (6.5%) belonged to vaccine type (4, 9V, 14, 23F). A total of 10 (16.4%) isolates were serotype 19A, all susceptible to penicillin, while 4 of them were resistant to erythromycin and clindamycin (phenotype C). A total of 7 (11.5%) were resistant to penicillin, erythromycin and clindamycin and belonged to 7 different non-vaccine types. All isolates were susceptible to vancomycin and ceftriaxone. Conclusions: Pneumococcus is a leading cause of invasive and noninvasive infection among children and its seriousness is the increasing prevalence of drug-resistant strains. As reported in literature although the widespread PCV7 vaccination, an increase in non-vaccine types has been observed also in our study. Moreover the proportion of resistant pneumococci was higher among non-vaccine types. This study could be the a platform for future surveillance.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "G.

The Blended learning is characterized by integration of different information and communication technologies in a traditional educational context. Regarding the content and organization this integration may be very diverse in different co-relation of the traditional and online educational technologies. The technologies can be used to support the teaching, learning and pedagogical communication.Objective: The objective of the research is to perform on mosaic organized online educational resources with the relevant structure corresponding to the goals of the course \"Cultivation of viruses, riketsii, chlamids in the laboratory conditions\" from the post graduated education of masters' and bachelors' medical specialists. In this publication we propose a technology with description of the steps for developing a webbased course with a dynamic content with interactive possibilities. The course also integrates the legal documentation and includes the following topics: general theory, main terms of virus vaccines production and their application in practice, and therapy of the virus infections. Materials and Methods: Theoretical analysis and synthesis, questionnaire, information and communication technologies. Results: Full with content resources were created as a decision of some lections and practical lessons. They could be obtained from online resources, adapted and amended as well as tasks on different education activities.
