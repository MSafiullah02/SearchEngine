Observations that FOXP2 orthologues show almost no variation across distantly related species of reptile, bird and mammal [3]\u2013[5], while the gene differs by two adaptive amino acid changes between humans and chimpanzees [3], [5], has led to speculation that recent evolutionary changes in FOXP2 might be related to the emergence of language [3], [5], [6]. More recently, the lack of isolation calls produced by FoxP2 knockout mice [7], and concordant patterns of expression in the brains of humans, mice [8] and songbirds 9], support a wider function in sensorimotor integration and motor learning [10], [11].",

            "text": "Echolocating bats face especially challenging sensorimotor demands, using vocal signals for orientation and prey capture. They can emit echolocation pulses at rates of up to 200 sounds per second, interpret the resulting echoes within time-windows as short as several milliseconds and make motor responses such as changes in flight manoeuvres during these short time intervals [12]. The reception of ultrasonic pulses for orientation, obstacle avoidance and prey capture in flight require complex aural and either orofacial or, in some species, nasofacial coordination [13]\u2013[15]. Bat echolocation signals show great diversity, contain complex tonal information, and can be modified in response to echo feedback from targets [13], [14]. Auditory processing of echoes in the cochlea and brainstem involve several nuclei that show hypertrophy and differentiation in bats compared with other mammals, including the anteroventral cochlear nucleus, superior olivary complex and the inferior colliculus [16], [17], which appears to show specialisations for echo detection [18]\u2013[20]. Regions of the cerebellum, including the parafloccular lobes and the medial lobe (homologous to vermal lobules VI-VIII in other mammals), also show expansion in echolocating bats compared to non-echolocating mammals [21]. Pulse-echo delay-tuned neurons encoding target distance are present in the cortex and thalamus (medial geniculate body) [22]\u2013[24].",

Sensory nuclei, including the superior and inferior colliculi, show localised expression in the brains of the adult mouse and human foetus [8], [11], [25], while the thalamus (including the lateral and medial geniculate bodies) and the cerebellum also show localised FOXP2/FoxP2 mRNA expression in the brains of mammals and birds [8], [9], [25], [26]. This overlap, together with the general acceptance that FOXP2/FoxP2 functions in sensorimotor coordination, raises the possibility that FoxP2 might be involved in the neural circuits that underpin bat echolocation. Furthermore, bats are also one of only a few groups of vertebrates to exhibit vocal learning [27], [28], a condition that might be a precursor to language, and the evolution of which has been linked to developmental and seasonal patterns of FoxP2 expression in the brains (area X) of some songbirds [9].",

            "text": "Our understanding of the phylogenetic relationships among extant bat species has increased considerably over the past two decades [29]\u2013[36]. Bats diverged from other ordinal groups within the Laurasiatheria around 80 million years ago [37] and diversified in the early Eocene [33]. Bats were traditionally split into the two suborders Microchiroptera (bats that echolocate by producing sounds in the larynx) and Megachiroptera (Old World fruit bats represented by the single family Pteropodidae), however, the former is now known not to represent a true clade. Instead, the emerging and highly resolved molecular tree places all megachiropterans (which do not possess laryngeal echolocation) with some members of the microchiropteran superfamily Rhinolophoidea (horseshoe bats and allies) in a proposed new clade called the Yinpterochiroptera [33], [35], [36]. Other microchiropterans group together in a second clade-the Yangochiroptera-and this new arrangement raises the question of whether laryngeal echolocation has either evolved twice independently or has been lost in the Old World fruit bats [33], [35], [36], [38]. Although similarities between early fossil bats -which appear basal to all other bats-and extant echolocating species appear to support the latter scenario [38], others have argued in favour of convergence in the two clades [32]. A possible loss of laryngeal echolocation appears especially interesting given that one genus of cave roosting fruitbat (Rousettus) has subsequently evolved a simple from echolocation based on tongue clicking [38].",

However, many exceptions exist, and sonar features such as Doppler shift compensation, nasal emission and whispering echolocation, as well as passive listening used by some gleaning species to localize prey, all show independent origins across phylogentically distant groups [38].",

Alignments of new sequences with published FoxP2 sequences from mouse, primates and birds, and those obtained from archived genomic bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) libraries, revealed high amino acid conservation across most vertebrates [3]\u2013[5] but two highly variable exons in bats. We tested for and found evidence of divergent selection between the two main clades of bats, which have contrasting sonar signals. We also identified two FoxP2 exons that showed particularly high levels of variability and therefore surveyed these exons in a much wider range of bat species, as well as 18 cetacean species comprising 15 echolocating toothed whales and dolphins (suborder Odontoceti) and three non-echolocating baleen whales (suborder Mysticeti). This extensive survey confirmed that non-synonymous variation among bats exceeds levels recorded across all other vertebrates, but did not suggest that equivalent accelerated evolution was also a feature of echolocating cetaceans.",

On the other hand, we found evidence of a change in the strength of selection [39] in FoxP2 sequences between bats and taxa from related orders within the superorder Laurasiatheria. Significant variation in \u03c9 was detected with around 16% of sites identified as evolving under divergent selection (likelihood ratio test = 36.3, df = 3, P<0.001) (table 1). The higher estimated \u03c9 for bats over other laurasiatherians (0.23 versus 0.14) reflects the greater number of non-synonymous changes in this group. We repeated the analysis comparing the two major recognised lineages of bats (Yinpterochiroptera and Yangochiroptera) and found evidence for divergent selection at 19% sites (likelihood ratio test = 13.86, df = 3, P<0.01) with respective \u03c9 values of 0.23 and 0.14 (table 1). Thus most change in selective constraints operating on the FoxP2 protein probably occurred since these lineages diverged. We reconstructed the ancestral amino acid sequences for all bats, for yangochiropterans and for yinpterochiropterans, and confirmed that these are identical to the mammalian consensus sequence as well as the ancestral sequences of the Laurasiatheria and the Euarchontaglires. Both of these comparisons were also significant after fruit bats (Pteropodidae) were excluded from the analyses (for results table 1).",

All cetaceans shared three amino acid substitutions (Pro302, Ala304 and Met316) but no differences occurred between echolocating toothed whales and non-echolocating baleen whales. The site Met316 was also recorded in all members of the bat family Hipposideridae within the Yinpterochiroptera, while the Pro302 was shared by all members of the family Vespertilionidae in the Yangochiroptera. Of the two mutations in exon 7 previously linked to language development in humans (Asn303 and Ser325), the former was not identified in any other species, while the latter was found to be shared by the two carnivores sequenced as well as a major clade of bats comprising the echolocating members of the Yinpterochiroptera. Exon 17 was invariant across all non-bat eutherian mammals surveyed with the exception of a single non-synonymous substitution (I697M) in the pig. Within bats, however, amino acid variation was considerable, with between up to 8 nonsynonymous changes recorded for a species (Nycteris).

Significant divergent selection based on differences in the d\nN/d\nS ratios (\u03c9) was detected between laurasiatherians and bats, and also between the two major clades of bats, indicative of a change in the strength of natural selection between these groups. In these tests, higher d\nN/d\nS ratios were found in all bats and the clade Yinpterochiroptera, respectively, and values were almost identical, indicating that the detected change in selective pressure has probably occurred since the Yangochiroptera and Yinpterochiroptera diverged. Furthermore, both analyses gave similar results when fruit bats were removed, and thus the divergent selection cannot be attributed to the inclusion of taxa that might have lost the ability (and need) to echolocate.",

Although explicit tests for positive selection proved negative, the power of such tests to detect positive selection where sequence variability is low is very limited and prone to false negatives (type 2 error) [45]\u2013[47]. It is therefore not possible to rule out the possibility that a period of Darwinian selection has occurred. Indeed several aspects of the system suggest to us that a relaxation in FoxP2 in echolocating bats is unlikely. First, the fact that FoxP2 is implicated in sensorimotor coordination in mammals and echolocation bats face exceptional challenges in such coordination provide a priori reasons to expect full FoxP2 functionality in all echolocating bats. Second, FoxP2 is highly conserved across divergent lineages of vertebrates including birds, reptiles and mammals, and there is no reason why to suspect that FoxP2 should be any less important in bats than other taxonomic groups. Third, an absence of stop codons, and the non-random distribution of nonsynonymous changes among exons in bat FoxP2 sequences, which are also predicted to have less impact on the protein's physiocochemical properties than random changes, all suggest that the amino acid replacements are not due to relaxed selection. For these reasons we contend that the changes we report are more likely to have some adaptive significance. The observed correlation between substitution rates at neighbouring non-synonymous and synonymous sites could arise by hitchhiking effects, in which selection increases the fixation probability of linked weakly deleterious sites [48].",

            "text": "One possible explanation for higher FoxP2 variation in bats might relate to their capacity for vocal learning, which has been described in a number of species [27], [28], [49], [50]. Following speculation that mutations in humans FoxP2 might be associated with the evolution of language, a number of studies have screened FoxP2 in vertebrate species that show evidence of vocal learning, which is widely considered to be a critical substrate for the evolution of human language. In addition to bats, vocal learning has also been reported in some lineages of birds [51]\u2013[55], cetaceans [56]\u2013[58] (see ref. [59] for a review) and was recently described in the African elephant [60]. Evidence from FoxP2 expression studies in avian brains have proven inconclusive [9], and sequence comparisons between non-vocal learners and song-learning birds as well as a small number of vocal learning mammals, have not identified specific mutations related to this ability [4], [9], [11]. The current study, which represents a considerable increase in the number of vocal learning taxa considered, with, 42 bat species, 18 cetacean species and African elephant added, found no consistently shared non-synonymous mutations among these species. Our results thus appear to support earlier studies that found no evidence of specific mutations associated with vocal learning abilities [3], [4], though we cannot rule out differential expression of this gene. Indeed, though some related bats in the Yinpterochiroptera were found to share a Ser325 residue with humans, the absence of this amino acid in other bat lineages, together with its presence in carnivores (also described previously [3]), suggest that it is unlikely to be associated with vocal learning. Perhaps more interesting is the result that two out of three amino acid substitutions that have occurred in the cetaceans (Pro302 and Met316) have also arisen independently in some bat families. These changes could in theory be linked to the evolution of vocal learning, however, if this were the case, then their absence in other bat genera known to exhibit learning (e.g. Rhinolophus) and the fact that both changes do not occur together in any bat, mean that if variation in FoxP2 has a role in vocal learning then it is not straightforward.",

On the other hand, if FoxP2 does function in echolocation, then the signature at exon 17 might be more suggestive that echolocation has evolved twice in bats. Here, fruit bats that do not have laryngeal echolocation (Yinpterochiroptera) (echolocation status 1 and 2 in tables S2, S3\nS4 and S5) show no differences from the dominant eutherian mammal sequence, while two amino acid changes are present in both the related genera Rhinolophus (T641A and D663E) and Hipposideros (V637E and D663E), with further non-synonymous substitutions in the hipposiderid genera Aselliscus (I602M and E657D) and Coelops (I621V, N644D, I655M and E657D).

The methionine to isoleucine substitution (M637I) in Hipposideros has also arisen independently in the yangochiropteran species Pteronotus parnellii but not in its congeners P. quadridens or P. macleayii. It is therefore interesting that P. parnellii is the only species of non-rhinolophoid bat to have evolved Doppler-shift compensation in echolocation, a feature that it shares with the genus Hipposideros. A striking example of rapid FoxP2 evolution is that of the yangochiropteran genus Nycteris, which, unlike its closest surveyed relatives, shows independent evolution of nasal emission, multi-harmonic call structure and prey location by passive listening [38], [64]. Nycteris also shows the highest rate of non-synonymous change at exon 17 of all species surveyed, differing from both the mammalian consensus and its closest relative by eight amino acids (V678A, A680T, T692A, E698A, L699F, D701E, I705E, L710S; table S4). Prior to this study, data on FoxP2 in bats was limited to a partial sequence of exon 7 in a single individual (Tadarida sp., family Molossidae) [3], [4]. Two amino acid differences at exon 7 (A307V and L292S) between the published Tadarida sequence and its close relative Chaerephon plicata (family Molossidae) further highlight the high degree of non-synonymous diversity in this order.",

Based on current findings, we suggest that echolocation in bats might have involved the recruitment of the FoxP2, and, more generally, that the protein might function in the mobilisation of downstream genes (or genetic cascades) involved in one or more aspects of the development or regulation of complex sensorimotor coordination. To investigate these speculations, data on the expression of FoxP2 in the bat brain, with particular attention to the neural pathways implicated in echolocation, would allow informative comparisons with published results from human, mouse and bird brains. To date, the delineated FoxP2 protein domains thought to be involved in DNA binding and transcription regulation [65] do not include either exon 7 or exon 17, though acidic transcription activation domains have been identified in the C-terminal of other forkhead genes [66]. Therefore the characterisation of these comparably variable domains in bats and other species, the former of which also contains two amino acids implicated in the evolution of human language [5], should also to help assess further the potential role and evolutionary significance of FoxP2 in sensorimotor integration and rapid motor learning.",

            "text": "If FoxP2 has in some way become recruited into neural pathways involved in bat echolocation, it might be associated with a change in selective pressure between echolocating bats and other mammals, and also between bat lineages that exhibit contrasting forms of echolocation system. Such changes in selection pressure can be small and detectable even when specific tests of positive selection prove negative. To test for evidence of divergent selective pressures among selected pairs of clades, we applied the modified version of Bielawski and Yang's maximum likelihood-based Clade Model C [39], [71], which is suited to sequence data with low divergence. This model is based on a branch-site model and allows variation in the d\nS/d\nN (\u03c9) ratio among sites with a proportion of sites evolving under different selective constraints between a pair of clades [39]. In the modified Clade Model C, the two clades were assumed to share sites under purifying selection (0<\u03c9\n0<1) and neutral evolution (\u03c9\n1\n = 1), but to differ at a third site class under divergent selection (\u03c9\n2\nclade 1\u2260\u03c9\n2 clade 2). We compared the model results with those obtained from the site model M1a (Nearly Neutral) to conduct a LRT with 3 degrees of freedom.",

We then compared the two major recognised lineages of bats (Yinpterochiroptera and Yangochiroptera). Both tests were repeated but with fruit bat sequences excluded, to assess whether any changes in selection pressure are likely to be due to relaxation resulting from a loss of echolocation. For the same reason we directly compared fruit bats and non-fruit bats within the clade Yinpterochiroptera. We tested the robustness of our results and tested for suboptimal likelihood peaks by rerunning the model under a range of initial values of \u03c9\n0, and found that estimates of the proportion of sites under divergent selection were consistent.\n",

Amino acid sequences of FoxP2 orthologues of all mammals excluding bats, birds and reptiles were aligned and, to correct for phylogenetic affiliations, were weighted based on PAML-derived branch lengths and known phylogeny topology [40]. From the evolutionary variation present, the physiocochemical constraint of each position was calculated based on several properties (hydropathy, polarity, charge, volume and free energy in an alpha helix and beta sheet), and the predicted impact (MAPP score) of all possible variants assessed [40]. For a second alignment, comprising bat orthologues, the MAPP score of each amino acid variant was derived, together with the score of all other variants at the same site in the alignment that differed from the ancestral sequence by an equal or fewer number of nucleotide substitutions. All such MAPP scores were then sorted and ranked. We then compared the mean MAPP rank score of observed variants to a null distribution of 10,000 mean rank scores, generated using the software MATHEMATICA (Wolfram Research Inc.) from ranks selected at random from the variable sites. Statistical difference between the means was assessed using a Z test.",
