In this paper, starting from a percolation perspective, we develop two strategies, the relationship-related (RR) strategy and the prediction relationship (PR) strategy, to avoid a local optimum only through the investigation of interrelationships among nodes. Meanwhile, RR combines the sum rule and the product rule from explosive percolation, and PR holds the assumption that nodes with high degree are usually more important than those with low degree. In this manner our methods have a better capability to collapse or protect a network. The simulations performed on a number of networks also demonstrate their effectiveness, especially on large real-world networks where RR fragments each of them into the same size of the giant component; however, RR needs only less than 90% of the number of nodes which are necessary for the most excellent existing methods.",

To achieve this, numerous methods have been proposed in the last few years, consisting of random immunization [15] , acquaintance strategies [7, 16] , targeted methods [3, 4, [17] [18] [19] , etc. [20] [21] [22] [23] , ranging from the need of local information to the whole network demand. With respect to random immunization, the immunization nodes are randomly selected from a certain network-without any priority about them. Similarly, random selection is also applied in the acquaintance strategy, but only one of the neighbors of a certain node is chosen to be immunized [7] . In addition, the targeted method is a widely accepted approach which first identifies the importance of each node and then removes the nodes in descending order of * yangliu@pik-potsdam.de importance until the network reaches the immunized demand [3, 4, 18, 19] .",

            "text": "Within networks, there are numerous relationships among nodes. Generally, high-degree nodes tend to connect to other high-degree nodes in assortatively mixed networks, while they mostly have low-degree neighbors in disassortative networks [24] . Moreover, a node with a low degree might play a critical role, whereas those with high degree might not be of significance comparatively (e.g., the betweenness centrality of nodes [25] ). In the course of immunization, some subinfluential nodes would become influential after a few nodes are removed, while some others might lose their importance instead [heuristic immunized strategies [3, 4, 18] , including the high adaptive degree centrality strategy, etc.]. All of such methods, e.g., the Collective Influence method (CI) [3] (better results always obtained with larger radius ), show that a better immunization strategy could be discovered when more interrelationships of nodes are considered. This may be also a good interpretation why the high adaptive betweenness centrality strategy (HAB) is significantly effective in most situations, as well as the belief propagation-guided decimation (BPD) method [4, 26] in artificial networks. But HAB has a limitation due to its high time complexity [O(n 2 m)] and BPD is not so effective in real-world networks because there are always many loops.",

For an optimization problem, the greedy strategy is quite efficient but readily induces a local optimum. In addition, taking Fig. 1 (a) as an example, the removal of a node would affect the status (remove or not) of other nodes. These facts motivate us to use another approach: can the local optimization be effec- In this network almost all of the methods mentioned in this paper will remove v 1 (marked with \"+ ') in the demand case of splitting this network into isolated ones, while the optimal removal set should be the nodes marked by \"\u00d7\" apparently. Now, assuming that v 2 is removed first, then most of these methods will easily find the optimal solution in the remaining network. But the same situation cannot be induced by removing v 3 . In other words, the removal of v 2 or v 3 will influence the status of v 1 (remove or not), and as a result it directly determines whether the optimal solution can be reached. (b) An example of RR under the sum rule and \u03c4 = 2. In this temporary network (\u03ba = 16), we consider two assumed cases: (1) (v 3 ,v 4 ) then (v 1 ,v 5 ) and (2) (v 2 ,v 4 ), then (v 1 ,v 5 ), i.e., two rounds of selection. For the first choice between v 3 and v 4 in case 1, the occupied node is either v 3 or v 4 since \u03be (v 3 ) = \u03be (v 4 ) = 5. After this, node v 1 would be chosen because of 1 = \u03be (v 1 ) < \u03be(v 5 ) = 3 (might induce the optimal solution of q c ). In contrast, v 2 would be selected to be occupied at first [3 = \u03be (v 2 ) < \u03be(v 4 ) = 5], and then v 5 [4 = \u03be (v 1 ) > \u03be(v 5 ) = 3] in case 2 (might be associated with the optimization of F ). In this example, we can also find how the status of a node influences the status of other nodes, e.g., v 2 to v 1 and v 5 . (c, d) An example of the PR method.

The main idea of the developed strategies is to explore and utilize the interrelationship among the nodes. In addition, RR combines the sum rule and the product rule from explosive percolation [29] , while PR holds the assumption that nodes with high degree are usually more important than those with low degree. In this way, our approaches can achieve a better capability of avoiding of local optimum and obtain smaller thresholds than other methods. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategies, we conduct numerous simulations on a number of networks. The results show that our methods have significant advantages over other strategies, especially on large real-world networks where RR can collapse each of them into the same size of the giant component with less than 90% nodes of CI, BPD, or the Explosive Immunization method (EI) [19] . Moreover, our methods might also be used for the feedback vertex set (FVS) problem [26, 30, 31] .",

As illustrated in Fig. 4 , RR significantly outperforms CI of lower G(q) curves on both ER and SF networks. Considering the threshold q c on the ER networks, we respectively obtain q c = 0.1767 by BPD, q c = 0.1843 through EI (slightly larger, 0.0005, than the results in Ref. [19] ) and q c = 0.1809 with PR. Meanwhile, PR with q c = 0.0977 is closer to BPD with q c = 0.0965 compared to EI with q c = 0.0996 in the SF networks. Besides, the results of q c versus the average degree k are exhibited in Fig. 5 . Interestingly, when tied by K = 6, EI performs worse and worse with the increase of k . The reason why this happens is ascribed to the fact that k (eff) v i (used to measure the spreading ability of a node [19] ) is harder and harder to identify the nodes with similar degree as k rising,",

We still employ the paradigmatic ER and SF models to construct our basis networks.

The threshold q c (G(S; q) < 0.01), the average giant fraction F and the size of the feedback vertex set n FVS of HD, CI a , BPD a , EI, PR, and RR on the 17 real-world networks. Here CI is with = 3 for the Email-EuAll network and = 2 for the as-Skitter network. Each result of EI, PR, and RR is obtained by averaging 20 independent realizations. The bold numbers are the minimal value of each objective among these methods for a same network. way to respectively choose one of the neighbors of v j and v k , assuming they are v jj and v kk satisfying (v j ,v jj ) = (v k ,v kk ) = 1, (v jj ,v kk ) = 0, and v jj = v kk . (iii) Cut (delete) the edges (v j ,v jj ) and (v k ,v kk ) and at the same time add two new edges (v j ,v k ) = (v jj ,v kk ) = 1. (iv) repeat (i)-(iii) until the network reaches our demand, i.e., a given clustering coefficient. In this manner, the clustering coefficients of these networks can be improved and, apparently, the degree distribution of them is kept constant. As illustrated in Fig. 6 , the fraction n FVS /n of PR rise more slowly than BPD with the increase of the clustering coefficients CC in both ER and SF networks, while the threshold q c of PR decreases more quickly than BPD. This may indicate that PR is more suitable than BPD for real-world networks. Therefore, we also show the performances of BPD, PR, and RR for the FVS problem in Table II where PR finds a smaller FVS than BPD in almost all the networks (16/17).",

Since it is hard to analyze the computational complexity of RR and PR in detail, we here put them as well as CI and BPD (open-source codes written by either C or C++ program) in the same simulated environment and compare their time consumptions. As illustrated in Fig. 7 , both PR and RR get smaller thresholds than CI and BPD within a quite short time, in particular, RR takes only 3.6 s to obtain a better result than CI and BPD in the TXroad network. Note that the running time of CI and BPD reported here may be as a reference but not as a standard. Finally, the susceptible-infectious-recovery (SIR) epidemic spreading model [5, 18, 46] is used to investigate the spreading process of a virus on the email-Enron network and the loc-Gowalla network by comparing the CI, EI, and RR methods. For a given network under SIR simulation, its nodes belong to either the susceptible, infected, or recovered state. And before the start of the simulation, a part of nodes are previously identified and removed from the network based on a certain strategy. Then one random node is selected from the remaining network as the infected source and the others are to be susceptible. In each time step, the infected nodes infect their susceptible neighbors with the infection rate \u03bb, and then they recover with rate \u03b7. The recovered nodes are removed from the network too. This process is repeated until there is no infected node in the network. The simulation results are shown in Fig. 8 where \u03bb and \u03b7 are fixed to 0.2 and 0.05, respectively. On both networks, RR has a significantly lower value (9.5 to 20.0 times) of recovered individuals than EI under the same immunized fraction q [Figs. 8(a) and 8(b) ]. Considering the final recovered fraction R f [Figs. 8(c) and 8(d)], RR also outperforms CI and EI in almost all situations.",

The proposed strategies choose the removed (immunized) fraction by repeatedly investigating and capturing the interrelationship among nodes. To evaluate the effectiveness of both proposed methods, we conduct numerous simulations on two types of model networks as well as 17 real-world networks from different fields. The results, especially most of the empirical networks, clearly illustrate that our strategy considerably outperforms the existing well-known strategies, like CI [3] and EI [19] . In addition, our strategies might open up a new path to investigate more effective solutions to the robustness and immunization problems as well as obtain the minimal feedback set [4] in network science.
