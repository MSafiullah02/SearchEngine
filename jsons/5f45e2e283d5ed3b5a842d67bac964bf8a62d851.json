            "text": "Infectious diseases are a major global concern and despite major advancements in medical research, still cause significant morbidity and mortality. Progress in antiviral therapy is particularly hindered by appearance of mutants capable of overcoming the effects of drugs targeting viral components. Alternatively, development of drugs targeting host proteins essential for completion of viral lifecycle holds potential as a viable strategy for antiviral therapy. Nucleocytoplasmic trafficking pathways in particular are involved in several pathological conditions including cancer and viral infections, where hijacking or alteration of function of key transporter proteins, such as Chromosome Region Maintenance1 (CRM1) is observed. Overexpression of CRM1-mediated nuclear export is evident in several solid and hematological malignancies. Interestingly, CRM1-mediated nuclear export of viral components is crucial in various stages of the viral lifecycle and assembly. This review summarizes the role of CRM1 in cancer and selected viruses. Leptomycin B (LMB) is the prototypical inhibitor of CRM1 potent against various cancer cell lines overexpressing CRM1 and in limiting viral infections at nanomolar concentrations in vitro. However, the irreversible shutdown of nuclear export results in high cytotoxicity and limited efficacy in vivo. This has prompted search for synthetic and natural CRM1 inhibitors that can potentially be developed as broadly active antivirals, some of which are summarized in this review.",

The double membrane structure of the NE contains numerous nuclear pore complexes (NPC) that are the only conduit of macromolecular trafficking between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. Consisting of a central core structure with nuclear and cytoplasmic extensions, the NPC is a highly selective molecular sieve that regulates bidirectional transport of macromolecules larger than 60 kDa (Mattaj and Englmeier, 1998; Gorlich and Kutay, 1999) . Although passive flux of molecules <55 kDa can occur, most transport through the NPC is mediated by members of the karyopherin superfamily, which recognize nuclear localization sequences (NLSs) or nuclear export sequences (NESs) on cargo molecules for transport into and out of the nucleus, respectively. Shuttling transport receptors mediate all cargo transport and operate via similar mechanisms. Initiated by the recognition of the signaling motifs (NLS or NES) on cargo molecules, the shuttling transport receptors, such as importins and exportins, carry out nucleocytoplasmic exchange from the originating compartment to the target destination. Upon delivery, the empty receptors cycle back to mediate additional rounds of transport (Gorlich and Mattaj, 1996; Mattaj and Englmeier, 1998; Khmelinskii et al., 2014) .",

CRM1 binds to protein cargoes at its outer convex surface by anchoring to key hydrophobic residues in the NES peptide into the NESbinding groove, unlike importins which bind with residues on their inner surface. Conformational changes involving H21 and H9 loop (a long conserved loop that connects H9A and H9B) are key structural elements crucial for CRM1 function. CRM1 adopts a ring-shaped structure with its N-and C-terminal HEAT repeats in close proximity which compacts further on forming a complex with the cargo and Ran GTP. In the unliganded state the H9 loop, which connects H9A and H9B, brings the helices H11A and H12A closer to each other and cuts off access to the NES groove. In addition, H21 crosses the CRM1 ring, interacts with both the H9 loop and the NES binding groove to render CRM1 inactive. In the CRM1-cargo-Ran GTP complex, H21 aligns itself with the CRM1 ring and the H9 loop adopts a betahairpin structure which displaces it from the NES binding groove. These conformational changes are crucial for the functioning of CRM1 whereby it adopts three conformations including an inactive ligand-free state with a closed NES groove, an active NES and RanGTP-bound state with an open groove and an intermediate NES bound (without RanGTP) state. The cysteine residue located within the hydrophobic NES-binding region at position 528 is the prime target for most CRM1 inhibitors including leptomycin B (LMB) (Petosa et al., 2004; Monecke et al., 2009; Sun et al., 2013; Fung and Chook, 2014; Turner et al., 2014) .",

            "text": "Among the seven known nuclear export proteins in the Karyopherin family, CRM1 is the best characterized nuclear exporter. CRM1 is the sole nuclear exporter of several cellular growth and survival factors including proteins and RNA. FIGURE 1 | Nuclear export. Nuclear export is initiated by the recognition of an NES-carrying cargo by CRM1 and formation of a tricomplex with RanGTP. This is followed by sequential docking and undocking events at the NPC. After translocation into the cytoplasm the tricomplex is dissociated by the hydrolysis of RanGTP to RanGDP by RanGAP. The released CRM1 protein returns to the nucleus and repeats the process. CRM1-mediated transport mediates cell proliferation through several pathways (Figure 2) . (i) The subcellular localization of NES-containing oncogenes and tumor suppressor proteins involved in regulating cell division, controlling apoptotic pathways, and maintain genomic integrity by recognizing and repairing DNA damage. Many of these regulatory proteins are mislocalized in a large variety of tumors (Turner et al., 2014; Sun et al., 2016) . (ii) The control of mitotic apparatus and chromosome segregation through the regulated export of centrosome-associated proteins. For instance, inhibition of nucelophosmin by LMB results in its dissociation from centrosomes and premature centrosome duplication (Wang et al., 2005) . BRCA1, a tumor suppressor protein commonly mutated in breast and ovarian cancer, stimulates DNA repair at the nucleus and inhibits centrosomal duplication in response to DNA damage (Arnaoutov et al., 2005; Nguyen et al., 2012) . Disruption of CRM1-mediated export blocks the localization of BRCA1 at the centrosome and results in failure for cells to detect DNA damage (Brodie and Henderson, 2012) . (iii) crm1 yeast mutants had altered chromosomal structures that appeared as rod-like thickened fibers suggesting a role for CRM1 in maintenance of chromosomal and nuclear structures (Toda et al., 1992) . In addition, abnormal nuclear morphology and cell cycle arrest at both G1 and G2 phases were observed in leptomycintreated yeast (Nishi et al., 1994) . CRM1 levels remain constant throughout the cell cycle and it is mainly localized to the NE in highly specialized cellular bodies called CRM1 nuclear bodies (CNoBs) that depend on RNA polymerase1 activity, suggesting a role in ribosome biogenesis (Gravina et al., 2014) .",

HIV Rev protein is a 19 kDa phosphoprotein that mediates controlled expression of 4 and 9 kb retroviral mRNAs (encoding the vif, vpr, and vpu/env genes and the gag/pol gene, respectively) in the nucleus (Najera et al., 1999; Fontoura et al., 2005) . Rev protein carries an NLS peptide enabling translocation into the nucleus, an RRE-binding (Rev response element) domain that binds to the unspliced mRNA, as well as an \"activation\" domain which contains the NES peptide which allows shuttling of the transcripts into the cytoplasm using CRM1-mediated export ( Table 1 ; Kimura et al., 1996; Wolff et al., 1997; Najera et al., 1999; Urcuqui-Inchima et al., 2011) .

After HTLV-1 entry, the viral genomic RNA is reversetranscribed and integrated into the host genome. HTLV-1 genomic RNA encodes more than 10 viral proteins and has three alternatively-spliced forms of viral mRNAs that are unspliced (encodes Gag, Pro, and Pol proteins), singly (partially)-spliced (encodes Env) and doubly (fully)-spliced (encodes accessory proteins, such as Tax, Rex, P30II, p12, and p13). The viral mRNA from the provirus for the first round of transcription is completely spliced to tax/rex mRNA by the cellular splicing machinery. Tax stimulates gradual accumulation of Rex in the nucleus which in turn permits Rex-mediated nuclear export of unspliced and partially spliced viral RNA into the cytoplasm (Younis and Green, 2005; Knipe and Howley, 2013; Nakano and Watanabe, 2016) .",

The replication cycle of orthomyxoviruses consist of attachment, receptor-mediated endocytosis followed by release of the viral ribonucleoprotein (vRNP) in the cytoplasm. The vRNP is then imported into the nucleus where it undergoes transcription and replication. The newly formed vRNPs are exported to the plasma membrane to complete assembly of viral particles and budding (Knipe and Howley, 2013) The RNA genome of influenza virus encodes 11 viral proteins. The transmembrane proteins hemagglutinin, neuraminidase and M2 protein on the viral envelope assist in attachment and penetration, as well as M2 protein-mediated release of the vRNP into the cytoplasm. The vRNP consists of the (\u2212)ssRNA, three polymerase proteins (PB1, PB2, and PBA) that form the viral RNA polymerase complex (3P) and nucleoprotein (NP). Nuclear import of the vRNP is facilitated using importin-\u03b1 (Imp-\u03b1). Following transcription and replication in the nucleus, newly synthesized RNA is complexed with NP to form new vRNPs; reviewed in Nayak et al. (2004) and Boulo et al. (2007) .",

            "text": "Reclassified under the newly formed Pneumoviridae family, formerly under Paramyxoviridae, RSV is the major causative agent of lower respiratory tract infections among infants, immunocompromised and elderly with no approved antiviral therapy or vaccines (Simoes et al., 2015; Afonso et al., 2016) . RSV consists of a nucleocapsid core, wherein the RNA genome is tightly encapsulated by nucleocapsid proteins and the viral polymerase complex, contained within a lipid bilayer envelope. RSV infection is initiated when the large glycoprotein G facilitates attachment of the virion to the host membrane followed by fusion of the viral envelope with the host membrane mediated by the viral F protein. The nucleocapsid core is then released into the cytoplasm where the virus-encoded polymerase complex formed by L and P proteins, direct the transcription of the (\u2212)ssRNA genome to generate the primary mRNA transcripts, which are then translated into viral proteins (Ghildyal et al., 2006 (Ghildyal et al., , 2009 . The Matrix (M) protein possesses both NLS and NES sequences that enable it to shuttle in and out of the nucleus in the early and late stages of infection using importin \u03b2 (Imp-\u03b2) and CRM1, respectively. At the early stages of viral replication [about 5-6 h post infection (h.p.i)], the newly-synthesized M protein translocates into the nucleus via the action of the nuclear transport protein Imp-\u03b2 and accumulates in the nucleus up to 16 h.p.i (Ghildyal et al., 2006 (Ghildyal et al., , 2009 Bajorek et al., 2014) . Specific inhibition of CRM1-mediated nuclear export by LMB increased nuclear accumulation of M protein and reduced virus production ( Table 1 ). In addition, mutations in the CRM1 recognition site prevented successful nuclear export of M protein, which eventually halted virus production due to the failure of M protein to localize at the assembly sites. This shows that timely CRM1-dependent nuclear export of M protein is central to RSV infection (Ghildyal et al., 2006 (Ghildyal et al., , 2009 (Ghildyal et al., , 2012 Bajorek et al., 2014) .",

The nucleocytoplasmic localization of these P isoforms is dependent on the activity of the NES and NLS sequences located at the N-and C-terminals, respectively. P1 and P2 carry the dominant CRM1-dependent NES while P3-P5 carry a truncated version of NES allowing NLS to become the primary localization signal. This results in P1 and P2 being localized in the cytoplasm while P3-P5 are nuclear. (Table 1 ; Pasdeloup et al., 2005; Oksayan et al., 2012) . NES of P protein is conserved throughout the Lyssavirus genus (Pasdeloup et al., 2005) . P protein-mediated antagonism of interferon production in the host cell has been shown to play a major role in neuroinvasion and infection of peripheral nerves as it is essential for stable viral replication (Yamaoka et al., 2013) . In normal cells, the phosphorylation of STAT1 enables it to localize in the nucleus and regulate gene expression. P protein inhibits the phosphorylation, nuclear translocation and DNA binding activity of STAT1 resulting in inhibition of both type I and II interferon responses (Vidy et al., 2007) . In addition, P protein interferes with the phosphorylation of interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF-3) to retard interferon production (Brzozka et al., 2005) . Thus, P protein interaction is critical to rabies pathogenicity. Interplay between the NLS and NES sequences on P protein in combination with the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of the signal peptides regulate the localization of the viral protein (Gupta et al., 2000; Pasdeloup et al., 2005) . The complex interaction of P protein with the host cell trafficking machinery ensures success of infection and suppression of host antiviral responses (Oksayan et al., 2012) .",

Named after their characteristic icosahedral architecture, a typical herpesvirus consists of an outer envelope, tegument or matrix layers, and a capsid enclosed dsDNA genome (Knipe and Howley, 2013) . Human cytomegalovirus, the largest member of the herpesvirus family, is the most significant cause of congenital disease. The virion is composed of a glycoprotein embedded host-derived envelope that encloses the tegument layer and the viral core composed of the icosahedral protein capsid and a dsDNA genome. Viral gene expression takes place in three stages: immediate-early, early and late stages. The tegument (or matrix) layer, lies beneath the envelope and above the viral capsid, is composed of nearly 32 proteins that conduct a range of functions including host cell response and orchestrating viral assembly. These matrix proteins are added to the nucleocapsid partly in the nucleus and partly in the cytoplasm during viral maturation. In the early stages of infection, tegument proteins associate with microtubules and the NPC to deliver the viral genome into the nucleus. In the final stages of infection these proteins coordinate stabilization of the nucleocapsid, trafficking from the nucleus, assembly at the plasma membrane and budding (Kalejta, 2008; Knipe and Howley, 2013) .",

Pp65 localizes in the nucleus immediately after viral entry and carries out immune evasion tactics. Pp65 acts on two fronts, on one side it phosphorylates the viral immediate-early proteins and thereby protects them from being recognized by the host immune system (Gilbert et al., 1996) . Pp65 also retards the expression of both MHC class 1 and II molecules thus crippling viral recognition by both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (Odeberg et al., 2003; Frankenberg et al., 2012) . Pp65 also retards the host interferon response, particularly type 1 interferon response, reducing expression of interferon beta and other cytokines (Abate et al., 2004) . Disruption of CRM1medited export of pp65 resulted in its nuclear retention and decreased viral replication (Sanchez et al., 2007) . During the lytic stage of the viral cycle, pp65 utilizes CRM1-mediated transport to shuttle into the cytoplasm ( Table 1 ; Sanchez et al., 2007; Frankenberg et al., 2012) . Another key function of pp65 is to inhibit natural killer cell cytotoxicity by directly binding to the activation receptor NKp30 (Arnon et al., 2005) .",

It is a polyketide with a \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated d-lactone portion that covalently binds through Michael addition to the Cys528 in the CRM1 NES groove (or Cys529 in Saccharomyces pombe). Binding with LMB initially forces CRM1 to remain in a half open conformation. This is followed by hydrolysis of the lactone group of LMB in the presence of basic amino acid residues in the NES groove and thereby stabilizes the interaction making it irreversibly bound to CRM1 (Figure 3 ; Kudo et al., 1998) . The persistent shutdown of CRM1 mediated nuclear export and off target activity are possibly the reasons why it is highly deleterious to the cell (Newlands et al., 1996; Fung and Chook, 2014; Perwitasari et al., 2014) . LMB has been shown to block the export of influenza viral ribonucleoproteins (vRNP) containing the (\u2212)ssRNA genome, nucleoprotein and polymerases, from the nucleus into the cytoplasm and thereby inhibit influenza replication (Perwitasari et al., 2014) . Table 1 lists some of the outcomes of LMB treatment in cells infected with selected viruses. ",

However, LMB alternatives ratjadone and anguinomycin A inhibit CRM1-mediated export almost identically, binding covalently to Cys528 with reduced cytotoxicity (Sun et al., 2013) .

They had better in vivo tolerance, up to 16-folds higher than LMB ( Table 2) . Although the NEIs cause inhibition of CRM1 in normal and tumor cell types, the downstream consequences of this inhibition are different to that of LMB, inducing cell cycle arrest (instead of apoptosis) in normal lung fibroblasts and apoptosis in p53 wild-type cancer models (HCT-116 colon model and SiHa cervical cancer) (Mutka et al., 2009) . Topoisomerase II\u03b1 (topo II\u03b1) is a transcription factor that activates DNA-cleavable complexes and induces cell death. However, drug resistant myeloma cells mislocalize topo II\u03b1 to the cytoplasm using CRM1 nuclear export to escape apoptosis (Engel et al., 2004) . KOS-2464 (Kosan Biosciences/Bristol-Myers Squibb), a semisynthetic NEI induces rapid and prolonged inhibition of CRM1, and apoptosis in drug resistant multiple myeloma cell lines at nanomolar concentrations (low IC50 value of 2 nM) without the toxicity associated with LMB (Turner et al., 2012b) . Treated cells were found sensitive to topo II\u03b1 inhibitors while normal cells remained unaffected by the combined effects of CRM1 and topoII\u03b1 inhibition (Turner et al., 2009) . In comparison to LMB, the absence of apoptosis despite cell cycle arrest by KOS2464 in normal lung fibroblasts is indicative of reduced off-target activity (Turner et al., 2012a) .",

The smaller structure of SINEs in comparison to LMB ( Table 2) translates as 40% occupancy of the NES groove leaving the remaining portion of the hydrophobic groove open and unoccupied. SINEs bind to CRM1 with their trifluoromethyl groups buried deep within the NES binding groove. Unlike LMB, SINEs are not hydrolyzed after conjugation probably due to its attachment deep into the NES groove protected from potential nucleophiles and oxyanions. The conjugation of KPT 185 to CRM1 and its inhibition activity is reversed by 40-60% after 24 h most likely due to a lack of the hydrolysis of its active enone group. The slow reversibility of SINEs possibly contributes to their improved tolerance since withdrawal of the drug allows deconjugation of the drug from CRM1 and essential nuclear export to resume in normal cells.",

Defective PTEN expression and/or CRM1 overexpression results in mislocalization of FOXO to the cytoplasm and promotes tumorigenesis (Ramaswamy et al., 1999; Brunet et al., 2002) . In search for FOXO inhibitors Kau et al. (2003) utilized a cellbased, chemical genetic screening regimen to screen compounds from the NCI Structural Diversity Set, ChemBridge DiverSetE, and a small collection of NCI marine extracts to detect nuclear localization of FOXO. 11 compounds were found to interrupt CRM1-mediated nuclear export targeting Cys528. Eight of these compounds had an \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated ketone or amide group capable of Michael-type addition with Cys528 and the other 3 compounds probably modified Cys528 through a nucleophilic attack or induced a chemical rearrangement (Kau et al., 2003) Valtrate, Acetoxychavicol Acetate, and Prenylcoumarin Osthol",

Drug resistanthuman multiple myeloma cell lines became more sensitized after inhibition of CRM1-meidated nuclear export using ratjadone. They were more responsive to topoII\u03b1 inhibitors (such as doxorubicin and epoposide) and to anticancer drugs, such as topotectan (a topoisomerase inhibitor) and cis-platinum (a DNA cross linking agent) (Turner et al., 2009 ). Treatment with ratjadones has shown to inhibit cell proliferation by inducing cell cycle arrest at G1 and an increase in size of the nuclei (indicative of effective block of nuclear export) (Burzlaff et al., 2003; Koster et al., 2003) . Recently ratjadone A has been shown to exert anti-HIV activity in vitro in a dose-dependent manner at nanomolar concentrations. Its inhibitory effect occurs 12 h.p.i. and interferes with the formation of the CRM1-Rev-NES complex by binding to CRM1 but not to Rev (Fleta-Soriano et al., 2014) .",

Extensive research has showed curcumin as the major bioactive chemical responsible for a wide array of pharmacological properties that involve regulation of various cellular growth and transcription, cytokines production or inhibition, protein kinases, and other enzymes (reviewed in Aggarwal et al., 2007; Jagetia and Aggarwal, 2007) . Suppression of constitutive NF-kB signal pathway (Aggarwal and Shishodia, 2004) , myeloid differentiation protein 2 (MD-2) (Gradisar et al., 2007) , Akt/ mTOR (Beevers et al., 2009) , and STAT3 signaling (Kim et al., 2003) have been suggested for the antitumorigenic effects of curcumin. Recently, CRM1 has been confirmed as one of the cellular targets directly interacting with curcumin. Curcumin was shown to covalently interact with CRM1 at Cys528, induce the nuclear retention of FOXO1 and upregulates the expression of p73 and p27 in HeLa cells. In addition, CRM1 modulation by curcumin downregulated the expression of proinflammatory proteins COX-2 and cyclin D1 in a dosedependent manner (Niu et al., 2013) .",

At low concentrations, endogenous 15d-PGJ2 exerts anti-inflammatory effects, promoting chemotaxis and activation of eosinophils, while at high concentrations it induces eosinophil apoptosis in a PPAR\u03b3-independent manner (Miwa et al., 2004; Ueki et al., 2007) . Exogenous administration of 15d-PGJ 2 has shown to have antiviral, antiproliferative and anti-inflammatory effects. 15d-PGJ 2 promotes translocation of PPAR\u03b3 to the nucleus and activation of NF\u03baB/I\u03baB signaling pathway to mediate anti-inflammatory responses. Exogenous 15d-PGJ 2 ( Table 2) has been shown to interrupt CRM1-mediated nuclear export by interacting with CRM1 similar to LMB (Hilliard et al., 2010) . In comparison to LMB higher concentrations of 15d-PGJ 2 are required to inhibit CRM1 probably because its \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated carbonyl group can only modify selected or exposed nucleophilic groups. However, this also enables targeted inhibition of a subset of proteins. 15d-PGJ 2 and/or derivatives of this PG as a CRM1 inhibitor hold promise as therapeutic agents as it can be produced by higher eukaryotes and can therefore function as both endogenous and exogenous regulator of CRM1 mediated nuclear export (Hilliard et al., 2010) .",

For instance, thymoquinone, the main constituent of the volatile oil from Nigella sativa (black cumin) seeds, is reported to protect laboratory animals against chemical toxicity and induction of carcinogenesis. Thymoquinone reacts in vitro with glutathione through a spontaneous and rapid reaction that produces a dihydrothymoquinone-thioether via 1,4-Michael addition mechanism, like LMB, thereby suggesting that thymoquinone may be capable of inhibiting CRM1 (Forouzanfar et al., 2014) .",
