The progress curves of the SARS-CoV protease reactions in the presence of varying concentrations of the time-dependent inhibitor were measured using the fluorogenic substrate [S2-S4] . The reaction was initiated by adding 0.05 \u00b5M enzyme to a mixture containing 6 \u00b5M substrate and 0.3 to 3 \u00b5M inhibitor. Over the entire 5-min time window, the uninhibited enzyme displayed a linear progress curve, whereas the inhibited enzyme with different concentration of inhibitor showed a time-dependent reduction of reaction velocity (Figure 1) . A higher inhibitor concentration, the reaction velocity was lower. This indicates the inhibitor is either slow-binding or slow-inactivating inhibitor.",

The total volume we used to do the activity assay was 1.2 mL. For initial velocity measurements, the increase of the substrate fluorescence at 538 nm was monitored for the first 300 s of the reaction. The reduction of enzyme activity with the incubation time with the inhibitor was fitted with a single exponential equation to obtain the k obs of inactivation at different inhibitor concentration. The small k obs value suggests that the inhibitor is a slow inhibitor.",

The bound CMK peptide, water molecules (except HOH_16), and chain B were removed from the original PDB file. Compound structures were drawn in CAChe (Fujitsu, Japan) and refined by performing an optimized geometry calculation in mechanics using augmented MM2 parameters. The target structure (1uk4 chain A) was first added essential hydrogen atoms, assigned Kollman united atom charges [S7] , and given solvation parameters before docking study. Compound molecules were added all polar hydrogen atoms, ",
