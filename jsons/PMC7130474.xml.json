Findings on physical examination are few in light of the subjective discomfort of the patient, and the symptoms may vary from patient to patient with the same illness. The incubation period for most common cold viruses is 24 to 72 hours [8]. Colds usually persist for 3 to 7 days in the normal host; however, 25% of colds may last as long as 2 weeks [2]. Risk factors that increase severity of disease include young age, low birth weight, prematurity, chronic disease, immunodeficiency disorders, malnutrition, and crowding [8].",

With proper technique, the sensitivity for throat cultures approaches 90% and the specificity ranges from 95% to 99% [32]. False positive results can be linked to a 1% to 5% carrier rate for the organism [33]. Cultures take 24 to 48 hours to grow and cannot immediately be used for clinical decisions on whether to start antibiotics. Therefore, the rapid streptococcal antigen test (RSAT) has emerged as the first test of choice in the management of acute pharyngitis. Studies show a sensitivity of 80% to 90% and a specificity of 90% to 100% [28]. Although less sensitive than throat cultures, the RSAT provides results in minutes and can assist in same-day management.",

One study of over 500 patients demonstrated that lymphadenopathy occurred in 100%, fever occurred in 98%, and pharyngitis occurred in 85% of documented cases [44]. Posterior cervical lymph nodes are characteristically more involved than anterior chains in mono, and these nodes may be large and moderately tender [44]. Lymphadenopathy peaks in the first week and gradually resolves over 2 to 3 weeks. The pharyngitis of mono is commonly described as exudative that may appear white, gray-green, or display necrotic features. Other findings include severe fatigue and splenomegaly. In a study of 631 Division I collegiate athletes, mean splenic size was 10.65 cm in length and 5.16 cm wide. Seven percent of the athletes' baseline spleen size met the current criteria for splenomegaly [47]. In this population, a single ultrasound evaluation of spleen size is of limited value, and clinical judgment may be more useful. Splenomegaly associated with mono occurs in 50% to 60% of patients and usually recedes by the third week of illness [48].",

In contrast to the finding of atypical lympocytes, heterophile antibodies are sensitive and specific for mono (85% and 100%, respectively) [49]. Heterophile antibodies appear within 1 week of the onset of clinical symptoms, peak in weeks 2 to 5, and may persist at low levels for up to 12 months.
