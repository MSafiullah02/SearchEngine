The yield and possibly also diagnostic performance of the mariPOC\u00ae test system might be different in another epidemiologic situation. We purposefully conducted our study during a season when influenza viruses and RSV were circulating in the community, because the need for rapid testing appears to be highest for these viruses. From January to March 2011, pandemic-type influenza A (H1N1) and influenza B of Yamagata line were the dominant strains of influenza viruses in Finland. Influenza A dominated the epidemic in January and influenza B in February and March. Thus, the higher number of influenza B than influenza A viruses in our study reflects the epidemiologic situation. The fairly high proportion of samples positive for RSV in our study is in accordance with the epidemiologic occurrence of RSV during winter\u2013spring, 2011, in Finland.",
