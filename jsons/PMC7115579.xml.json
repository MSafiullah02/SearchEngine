This is accomplished by using fluids which contain proteins or amino acids, glucose, sodium, and bicarbonate. These solutes have a synergistic effect on the rate of intestinal absorption of each other and, therefore, of water.7 For example, the rate of intestinal absorption of sodium is greatly increased if glucose is present; conversely, the rate of intestinal absorption of glucose is more than doubled if sodium is present. Of course, through salivary, pancreatic, and hepatic secretion, some sodium is always present in the intestine, but the quantity may not always be sufficient for maximal rates of absorption to occur. Absorption of water is passive; as solutes are absorbed, it is absorbed. Thus, to obtain the maximal rate of water absorption a fluid designed to attain the maximal rate of solute absorption is required. A number of fluids designed for this purpose are available commercially*\nor can be formulated as shown in\nTable 2. Oral fluids constitute excellent media for microbial growth and are nonsterile; therefore, after use, the remainder should be refrigerated and, if not used within one to two days, it should be discarded.",

Although the energy and protein that most oral fluids provide are certainly of benefit, they are not sufficient to meet the animal\u2019s requirements. Therefore, additional energy must be provided if more than two days of therapy are required. Although the administration of oral fluids may increase the loss of fecal fluid, this does not negate their benefit. Their use will either reduce the net loss of water from the body or will result in a net gain of water. This is demonstrated in the example shown in\nTable 3, in which, prior to receiving oral fluids, the calf had a net water loss and a decrease in body weight of 1 kg per day. When oral fluids were given, fecal losses doubled, but the calf then had a net water gain and an increase in body weight of 1 kg per day. Weighing the patient eight hours or so after administration of oral fluids will confirm whether or not the fluids given orally or by any other route are being absorbed and retained in quantities adequate to overcome losses.",

Intravenous administration of fluids has the advantage that, since absorption is not a factor, the rate at which the fluid enters the body water pool can be controlled. Because of this, the rate at which fluids are given intravenously must be controlled according to the needs of the individual patient, the purpose of therapy, and the composition of the fluids given.

A 30 cm (12 in) catheter may induce ventricular fibrillation and death.

To insert the extracath, clip and disinfect the skin over the jugular vein, pinch the skin up and away from the vein, and make a single stab incision with a No. 11 Bard Parker blade. This procedure does not require local anesthesia or suturing after removal of the catheter. Next, place a tab on the hub of the catheter using two pieces of adhesive tape, approximately one half inch by 3 inches in size. The sticky sides should be together with the catheter hub between them. Attach a syringe to the catheter needle and insert the needle and catheter through the skin incision and into the vein, aspirating slightly as you do so. As soon as blood is drawn into the syringe, slide the catheter off the needle and down the vein. Tape the catheter to the calf s neck using adhesive tape. Encircle the calf s neck about 1\u00bd times with the tape which should be firmly stuck to the tab previously attached to the catheter hub. To prevent pulling on the catheter during the administration of fluid, the tubing from the fluid bottle to the catheter should be taped to the calf s forehead with a piece of tape encircling the calf s head just in front of the ears.",
