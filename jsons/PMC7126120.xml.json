            "text": "Although the development of first-in-class drugs with a novel mode of action is considered to be truly innovative, there are many other approaches used in drug research and development, like follow-on and analogue-based drug discovery, product-related research and platform drugs [1,2]. These strategies could result in lower costs, lower risk of failure, and shorter time to the market. Drug repositioning or repurposing, i.e. finding new indications for existing/approved drugs, is an increasingly utilized strategy in search of novel medicines [3,4], for example antiparasitic [5,6] and antimycobacterial use of antimalarial drugs [7,8]. Repurposing of antimalarial drugs as anticancer agents is particularly interesting, since different classes of antimalarials display either direct or adjuvant activity against cancer, act as sensitivity reversers of resistant tumour cell lines, inhibitors of drug resistance development, or synergistic agents with known anticancer drugs [[9], [10], [11], [12], [13], [14], [15], [16], [17], [18], [19], [20], [21], [22]]. Hydroxychloroquine, chloroquine and other antimalarial agents (artesunate, quinacrine, atovaquone, doxycycline) were evaluated or are currently under evaluation in numerous clinical trials (approximately 150) against different cancer types, alone or in combination with conventional anticancer drugs/treatments [23]. Derivatization of the registered antimalarial drugs, particularly their hybridization with various scaffolds, is also a popular strategy in search of novel biologically active agents with diverse biological profiles [[24], [25], [26], [27], [28], [29], [30], [31], [32]].",

PQ is an 8-aminoquinoline drug, developed and marketed in the 1940s. Today, after more than 70 years, it is still on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines [33]. Primaquine is active against gametocytes and exoerythrocytic forms of all species of the parasite causing human malaria, including chloroquine-resistant Plasmodium falciparum [34]. Until the registration of tafenoquine in 2018, it was the only drug available worldwide against the latent liver forms of relapsing malaria caused by P. vivax and P. ovale. In general, it is considered as a safe and well-tolerated drug. However, applying primaquine at a broad scale is complicated due to the severe toxicity in a subset of patients with an inherited glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency [35]. The other pitfalls of primaquine are quick metabolism, degradation to inactive carboxyprimaquine and altering the treatment outcome depending on CYP 2D6 enzyme activity [36,37].",

The main goal of the terminal amino group modifications was to prevent the metabolic pathway leading to the inactive and toxic carboxyprimaquine [38]. The modifications undertaken before 2009 have been reviewed in detail by Vale et al. [35]. Until 2009, two main sets of compounds were described: primaquine imidazolidin-4-one derivatives (imidazoquines) [[39], [40], [41]] and amino acid/peptide derivatives [[42], [43], [44], [45]] or their combination \u2013 primaquine peptide derivatives bearing the imidazolidin-4-one moiety [46,47]. These compounds were evaluated primarily as antimalarial agents, but some of them were tested for anticancer [48] or antifungal activities [49,50]. However, the present review covers various classes of primaquine N-derivatives prepared in the last decade by our research group and others with two goals: to get novel antiplasmodial agents (follow-on strategy) or to get novel compounds with different biological activities (repurposing strategy).",

Cinnamic acid and its derivatives (CADs) are naturally occurring substances with various pharmacological activities: antimicrobial, antifungal, antiviral, antimycobacterial, antiinflammatory and antioxidative [[54], [55], [56], [57], [58], [59]]. The findings of their anticancer [[60], [61], [62]] and antimalarial activities [63] prompted us to prepare the PQ-CAD hybrids of amide and acylsemicarbazide type [64]. Cinnamic acid and the following CADs were used: \u03b1-methylcinnamic acid, methoxy, dimethoxy, trimethoxy, methylenedioxy, chloro, fluoro, trifluoromethyl and bis-trifluoromethyl cinnamic acid. The amides 1\u201311 were prepared by the simple acylation of PQ with CAD chlorides (CADCl) or CAD-benzotriazolide (CADBt) (Scheme 1\n). On the other hand, PQ-CAD acylsemicarbazides were obtained by acylation of precursor 61 with the corresponding CAD chlorides.",

Primaquine was coupled with the corresponding cinnamic acids in the presence of 2-(1H-benzotriazole-1-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethylaminium tetrafluoroborate (TBTU) and N,N-diisopropylethylamine (DIEA). Primacins have shown increased in vitro activity against the liver stage of the rodent malaria parasite P. berghei, compared to the parent drug primaquine [66] and only a modest activity against Leishmania infantum [67]. They were inactive against erythrocytic stage of P. falciparum. In 2017, the same Portuguese research group reported triple-stage antimalarial ionic liquids based on primaquine and cinnamic acids and found them superior to the analogous amide hybrids [68].",

These derivatives were designed bearing in mind several facts: i) inflammation is often accompanied by the excessive formation of reactive oxygen and nitrogen species that are potentially damaging to DNA and cell membranes; ii) oxidative stress is a major contributing factor to high mortality rates associated with several diseases, including malaria and cancer; iii) long-term use of NSAIDs is associated with a lower risk of some cancer types; iv) NSAID derivatives with pronounced cytostatic activity were described in the literature [[70], [71], [72], [73], [74]]. However, the results of biological screening of amides 12\u201318 were rather disappointing: our compounds exerted moderate activities in the DPPH free radical test and \u03b2-carotene-linoleic acid assay and negligible antiproliferative effects, although ketoprofen derivatives 13 and 15 demonstrated a notable Fe2+-chelating ability.",

One of the symmetric bisquinoline derivatives, piperaquine, was registered in the 1960s and was used in malaria prophylaxis and therapy for more than twenty years [87]. Today, it is approved only in a fixed-dose combination with other antimalarial drugs (dihydroartemisinin or arterolane) [88]. It is considered that bulky bisquinoline compounds accumulate in the cell compartment with a decreased pH gradient, inhibit parasite hem-digestive pathway and contribute to the inhibition of chloroquine efflux transporters [82,89]. The dimerization strategy became attractive in the discovery effective anticancer drugs among antimalarials as well (see for example ref. [[90], [91], [92]]). Having these facts in mind, we have prepared three bis-PQ derivatives (41, 78 and 107) with two primaquine moieties connected by linkers bearing one or two urea groups.",

The results indicate that scaffold attached to primaquine has a significant impact both on activity and selectivity. Urea and bis-urea derivatives with one or two trifluoromethyl groups, chloro or methoxybenzhydryl moieties or trityl group, and SAHAquines with hydroxamic acid scaffold showed high activity to all tested cell lines, with the highest activity against human breast adenocarcinoma cell line (MCF-7) (for structures and references see Table 1\n). Urea 33 showed high selectivity towards the colorectal adenocarcinoma (SW620), whereas 29 was active against SW620 and murine lymphocytic leukaemia cell line (L120). However, the majority of the compounds displayed high selectivity towards MCF-7 cells, e.g. symmetric bis-PQ derivatives 41 and 78 and bis-ureas with hydroxy or halogenphenyl moieties 80\u201382, 85\u201391, 106. Such observation is not surprising since the sensitivity of MCF-7 cell line to primaquine and other antimalarial drugs has been documented earlier [47]. Bis-urea derivatives p-F (88) and p-OH (86) substituted benzene or hydroxypentyl (82) moieties, and twin primaquine derivative 78 were the most promising compounds in antiproliferative screening. Due to their high activity against MCF-7 cell line, extreme selectivity and favourable druglike properties, they may be considered as lead compounds in the discovery of breast carcinoma drugs.",

Amide 8 with o-fluorine moiety significantly inhibited the growth of SW620, MCF-7 and cervical carcinoma (HeLa) cells (IC50 = 0.3\u20132.1 \u03bcM), acylsemicarbazides 64 (p-methoxy) against MCF-7, L1210, CEM and HeLa (IC50 = 0.4\u20132.4 2.4 \u03bcM), whereas 71 (p-CF3) showed activity towards MCF-7 cells in the nanomolar scale (IC50 = 0.03 \u00b1 0.02 \u03bcM) and modest activity towards other tested cell lines [64]. To better understand the underlying mechanisms, the effects of compounds 8, 64 and 71 on MCF-7 cells were studied [65]. Morphological studies using haematoxylin and eosin staining revealed that compounds 8 and 71 induced morphological changes in cells characteristic for the apoptosis. Cell cycle analysis showed that cells treated with 8 and 71 were in the sub-G1, while cells treated with 64 were mainly in the interphase (G1 phase). The treatment of MCF-7 cells with 8 and 71 resulted in the poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP) cleavage as well as caspase-9 activation, indicating the induction of apoptotic cell death. Compounds 8 and 71 inhibited the migration and invasion of MCF-7 cells, while compound 64 had marginal effect. Further biological experiments showed that bis-urea 88 induced growth inhibition in MCF-7 cell line through at least two different mechanisms: by induction of the cell cycle arrest in G1 phase and inhibition of the cell cycle progression through transient M phase accumulation and subsequent G2 arrest, and by inducing apoptosis [83]. On the other hand, SAHAquines 129\u2013132 containing free hydroxamic acid proved to be HDAC inhibitors. The antibodies against acetylated histone H3K9/H3K14 in MCF-7 cells revealed a significant enhancement following treatment with 130 [104]. We have also shown that SAHAquine 130 selectively inhibits cytoplasmic HDAC6 in nanomolar concentration without markedly suppressing class I HDACs and suppresses epidermal growth factor receptor and downstream kinase activity, which are prominent therapeutic targets in glioblastoma multiforme [105]. In addition, compound 130 significantly reduces the viability and invasiveness of glioblastoma tumoroids, as well as brain tumour stem cells, which are crucial in the tumour survival and recurrence. These effects are augmented with the combination of SAHAquine 130 with temozolomide, the natural compound quercetin or buthionine sulfoximine, an inhibitor of glutathione biosynthesis.",

Five subsets of PQ derivatives with amide or urea moieties (57 compounds) were evaluated for antiplasmodial activity in vitro against the erythrocytic stage of P. falciparum NF54 [93,109,110]. Out of them, 33 compounds showed weak activity (IC50 = 10\u201320 \u03bcM) and 7 compounds strong activity in low micromolar range. QSAR analysis of the obtained data yielded a highly accurate statistical model which was used to prioritize novel candidate compounds: PQ-ureidoamides 108\u2013113. These compounds were active against P. falciparum while exhibiting a very favourable toxicity profile towards human cells in vitro, which was retained even when the glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) was inhibited. On the other hand, bis-ureas 90, 93 and 76 with p-chlorobenzene, p-CF3-benzene and dimethoxybenzhydryl moieties displayed antiplasmodial activity in vitro against liver stage P. berghei in the nanomolar scale (IC50 = 42.0, 74.9 and 82.8 nM) [109]. Compound 93 showed antiproliferative activity in low micromolar concentrations as well. Asymmetric primaquine/halogenaniline fumardiamides 138\u2013143 also exhibited high activity against P. berghei hepatic stages, higher than the parent drug (IC50 values ranging between 0.11 and 0.39 \u03bcM; IC50 of primaquine 8.4 \u00b1 3.4 \u03bcM) and moderate activity against P. falciparum erythrocytic stages, PfDd2 and Pf3D7 strains (IC50 = 7.74\u201318.43 \u03bcM) [111]. The most active compounds 142 and 143 showed low cytotoxicity towards human cells (MCF-7 and HEK293T), also when G6PD enzyme was inhibited. On the other hand, SAHAquines 129\u2013132 showed dual stage antiplasmodial activity which correlated with their cytostatic activity [104]. Finally, blood-schizontocidal activity of primaquine conjugates 150\u2013153 with glucosamine and two polymers of polyaspartamide type (PHEA and PHPA) was tested against P. berghei infection in Swiss mice [108]. On the day 4, all the mice treated with polymeric conjugates were either aparasitemic or had significantly (p < 0.001) lower parasitaemia compared to negative-controls and the glucosamine conjugate. Among polymeric conjugates, compound 152 appeared to be the best with respect to the suppression of parasitaemia.",

To mention just the most important ones: 8-hydroxyquinoline, nitroxoline and several generations of quinolone/fluoroquinolone derivatives (norfloxacin, ciprofloxacin, enoxacin, ofloxacin, moxifloxacin, etc.). Based on these facts, the in vitro antimicrobial activity of selected PQ derivatives (ureas 43\u201352, bis-ureas 85\u201394, ureidoamides 108\u2013113, PQ-fumardiamides 138\u2013143 and succindiamides 144\u2013149) was carried out against a panel of Gram-positive bacteria, Gram-negative bacteria and fungi [83,94,106]. A list of microorganisms is given in Supplementary Material, SI Table 16. The tested compounds varied in activity (inactive, slightly active or active in low micromolar concentrations, but cytotoxic as well). However, some ureidoamides showed selective antimicrobial activity without haemolytic and cytotoxic effects (108 and 111 vs. Staphylococcus aureus strain, MIC = 6.5 \u03bcg/ml; 110 and 111 vs. Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, MIC = 25 \u03bcg/ml). In addition, all ureidoamides had high efficiency against the biofilm formation of E. coli (the minimum biofilm eradication concentration, MBEC, from 6.25 to 50 \u03bcg/ml), and some of them against P. aeruginosa and Candida albicans [94]. On the other hand, fumardiamides 138\u2013143 showed significant antimicrobial activity (e.g. compound 141 vs. S. aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, C. albicans, MIC = 6.1\u201312.5 \u03bcg/ml). Two microorganisms, namely E. faecalis and S. aureus showed high susceptibility to all fumardiamides, while E. coli, S. pneumoniae and P. aeruginosa were susceptible to five out of six fumardiamides. In biofilm eradication assay, majority of the bacteria, particularly S. aureus, showed susceptibility to all fumardiamides [106]. The most active compounds were fluoro-derivatives 138 and 139 (the lowest MBEC 6.3 \u03bcg/ml). A high biofilm eradication potential of fumardiamides might be explained by the reaction of Michael acceptor with cysteine thiol, which could prevent disulfide bond formation. It is a well-known fact that cysteine homeostasis impacts biofilm formation and production of extracellular matrix components, as well as folding and stability of extracytoplasmic proteins [112].",

Two antioxidant assays were used: (i) interaction with the stable free 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl radical (DPPH test) and (ii) interaction with the water-soluble azo compound 2,2\u2019-(2-amidinopropane) dihydrochloride (AAPH) (inhibition of lipid peroxidation, LP).

Compound 78 decreased the body temperature of normothermic mice, inhibited significantly 5-hydroxy-l-tryptophan-induced 'head-twitch' responses and protected mice against clonic seizures. All compounds decreased locomotor activity of mice, while derivatives 74 and 83 increased the hyperactivity caused by the amphetamine administration. All tested compounds showed antinociceptive activity in the \u2018writhing\u2019 test. Compounds 37 and 78 were active in a wide range of doses up to 0.00125 ED50 and their antinociceptive effect was reversed by naloxone.
