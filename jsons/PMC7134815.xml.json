            "text": "A 36-year-old G2P0SA1 woman traveled to China during the SARS outbreak. At the time, she was not aware that she was 7 weeks pregnant and during her stay in China she developed cold and cough symptoms. She was seen by a physician who advised her to receive a total of six injections of 200 mg ribvirin intramuscularly (IM) daily for three days. Eventually she received a total of three injections of 200 mg IM ribavirin within a 3-day period. She did not recall receiving any other medications beside ribavirin. The possibility of SARS in her case was ruled out by further investigation, and her cold symptoms subsided. She continued her pregnancy without any complications and at 13 weeks of pregnancy she called Motherisk in order to get information regarding ribavirin exposure and possible adverse effects on her current pregnancy. She was sent for ultrasound (US) at 11, 18 and 27 weeks of pregnancy and all reported to be within the normal range. Because of her age, she underwent amniocentesis at 18 weeks of pregnancy with negative results. Her pregnancy continued uneventfully. She developed some contractions at 40 (+3) weeks and with the assist of induction she delivered a baby girl with normal Apgar scores. Birth weight was 3.35 kg (7 lb and 6 oz). Her baby did not need any specific medical attention and did very well during the hospital stay. She and her baby were discharged from the hospital at 48 h. Her newborn developed mild jaundice on postnatal day 3 which did not necessitate any treatment and subsided after a few days. According to maternal report, her baby is 8 months old and healthy. She stated that the child has been followed by a pediatrician since birth. She was last seen by her pediatrician at 8 months of age. As reported by the infant's pediatrician, her physical examination was completely normal with no evidence of malformations or minor anomalies. She was able to sit up straight by herself without any support, babble, and have central grasping at 8 months of age. Her pediatrician also confirmed that her neurodevelopmental milestones have been within the normal range. The mother did not express concerns regarding the growth and health of her baby at the time of the follow up interview.",

            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome is a highly infectious disease with high rates of morbidity and mortality. The major therapeutic modalities in its treatment have been empirical. Critically, affected pregnant women had to be treated with potentially teratogenic drugs. The most commonly used first-line medications during the outbreak were ribavirin and corticosteroids [5], [8], [9]. Ribavirin has an FDA pregnancy category X, indicating high teratogenic probability based on consistent animal studies and biological plausibility. Hence, the drug is contraindicated in women who are or may become pregnant. If the use of ribavirin is considered critical by the physician, the pregnant patient should be made aware of the potential teratogenic effects of ribavirin and the limited information on its use in human pregnancy. While concerns of teratogenicity are higher in the first trimester during organogenesis, ribavirin may theoretically also cause functional defect even after the first trimester [17]. The manufacturer (Schering Corp. http://www.ribavirinpregnancyregistry.com) maintains a registry of pregnancy-related exposures and advises all women to wait 6 months following discontinuation of ribavirin before attempting to get pregnant.",
