Shedding of high viral titers from the respiratory tract, including shedding before the onset of symptoms, might have led to droplet and possibly aerosol transmission. Residents and staff members with undetected SARS-CoV-2 infection are likely to have contributed to transmission through interactions between and among residents and staff. The contribution of indirect contact transmission in this outbreak is not known. However, contaminated environmental surfaces and shared medical devices could also have played a role. Most of the early transmission appeared to have occurred in Unit 1, where the initial introduction of SARS-CoV-2 took place, several days before other units were involved.

However, multiple sources of symptom data were used to minimize such misclassification. The accuracy of symptom ascertainment for this investigation is likely to be equivalent to, if not exceed, symptom screening in most skilled nursing facilities, and thus, these findings should be generalizable to this setting. Second, because this analysis was conducted among residents of a skilled nursing facility, it is not known whether the findings apply to the general population, including younger persons, those without underlying medical conditions, or similarly aged populations in the general community or in other long-term care settings. Third, asymptomatic staff members were not tested; therefore, we are unable to document their role in transmission in this facility.",

Unrecognized asymptomatic and presymptomatic infections most likely contribute to transmission in these settings. During the current Covid-19 pandemic, skilled nursing facilities and all long-term care facilities should take proactive steps to prevent introduction of SARS-CoV-2. These steps include restricting visitors and nonessential personnel from entering the building, requiring universal use of face masks by all staff for source control while in the facility, and implementing strict screening of staff. Our data suggest that symptom-based strategies for identifying residents with SARS-CoV-2 are insufficient for preventing transmission in skilled nursing facilities. Once SARS-CoV-2 has been introduced, additional strategies should be implemented to prevent further transmission, including use of recommended personal protective equipment, when available, during all resident care activities regardless of symptoms.5 Consideration should be given to test-based strategies for identifying residents and staff with SARS-CoV-2 infection for the purpose of excluding infected staff and cohorting residents, either in designated units within a facility or in a separate facility designated for residents with Covid-19.",
