We reviewed the epidemiological history and living conditions of all patients. All of the patients lived in separate homes and maintained good hygiene habits before onset of disease. There was no evidence that they were infected with COVID-19 through the fecal-oral route rather than droplet spread or contact transmission. Further follow-up after hospital discharge also did not indicate that family members living with them in the same home were infected with COVID-19. However, the conclusion of In conclusion, based on the analytical results of this group of COVID -19 cases, the percentage of patients with fecal samples testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid was high, whereas the digestive symptoms of these patients were not significant.

For example, previous studies have shown that SARS-CoV that causes SARS may be transmitted via the fecal-oral route[15]. This study is limited by the small sample size and retrospective research method. Several concerns should be considered when interpreting our results. First, there was still a risk for false negative results for PCR nucleic acid testing of pharyngeal swab and fecal samples. Second, some patients did not have fecal samples every day, and thus the time when SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid results are negative may not be accurate in some patients. Third, there was no data of viral nucleic acid detection of lower respiratory tract specimens such as the SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection of alveolar lavage fluid, and thus we cannot compare the time when SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection results became negative in fecal and lower respiratory tract samples. In addition, we failed to explore the correlation between SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid-positive results using fecal samples and disease severity, because only two severe cases were involved in this study.",
