The cover letter was signed by representatives of the 3 parties involved in the study: Queen's University, The Change Foundation, and the Ontario Hospital Association. The project had an advisory committee, which comprised infection control, emergency management, and public health experts. The survey was to be directed to and completed by the person most responsible for developing their hospital's pandemic influenza plan. The needs assessment survey was based on the core components of the Canadian Pandemic Influenza Plan2 and the Ontario Health Plan for Pandemic Influenza.3 The domains evaluated included the following: pandemic influenza plan development, command and control roles and responsibilities, human resources, equipment and supplies, infection control and occupational health, triage and clinical care, security, transportation, mortuary issues, business continuity, training and educational strategies, communications, cooperation with local and regional agencies, and opinion regarding pandemic preparedness learning portal development. An analysis of the content of the pandemic influenza plans of Ontario acute care hospitals is presented in a separate paper (Zoutman DE, Ford BD, Melinyshyn M, Schwartz B. Content of pandemic influenza plans in Ontario acute care hospitals. Submitted for publication, 2009.).",
