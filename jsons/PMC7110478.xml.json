A vertical groove just below them forms a cleft in the upper lip, exposing the incisors. The nostrils communicate internally via vestibules with the anterior nasal cavities, which are separated by a median septum. The sinuses are also divided by the median septum, and are highly developed olfactory organs containing 7 rows of turbinal bones. The nasopharynx forms the posterior part of the pharyngeal duct, lying dorsal to the soft palate and communicating with both the oropharynx and the Eustachian tubes. The intermediate section of the respiratory tract consists of the larynx, trachea, and bronchi, all of which have cartilaginous support. The larynx is formed by 3 single (epiglottis, thyroid, and cricoid) and 3 paired (arytenoids, corniculate, and cuneiform) cartilages. Incomplete cartilaginous rings support the walls of the trachea by branching and fusing with one another dorsally. The trachea branches into the left and right bronchi dorsal to the aortic arch. Extrapulmonary bronchi have complete cartilaginous rings, whereas intrapulmonary bronchi have no cartilaginous rings. There are no muscle swellings in the pulmonary artery of the mouse as there are in the rabbit, guinea pig, and opossum. There are no bronchial artery-pulmonary artery precapillary anastomoses in the mouse as there are in humans. Nerve density in the lung is greater in the mouse than in the dog, cat, rabbit, or guinea pig. Respiratory bronchioles are short or nonexistent. Bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue is normally present only at the hilus of the lung. Lymphoid accumulations are present on the visceral pleura of mice, within interlobar clefts.",

To accommodate for this high metabolic rate, the mouse has a rapid respiratory rate, short air passage, high alveolar Po\n2, moderately high erythrocyte concentration, high red blood cell hemoglobin and carbonic anhydrase concentrations, high capillary density, and high blood sugar concentration. The hemoglobin affinity for oxygen with changes in pH is more pronounced (Bohr effect). Mice also exhibit a slight shift in the oxygen-dissociation curve, enabling oxygen to be unloaded in the tissue capillaries at a high Po\n2.",

            "text": "In the rat,20, 21, 22, 23, 24 the external nares are shaped like inverted commas, open on the lateral aspect of the nose, and can be closed under water. The rat has several well-developed nasal glands but the largest is the Steno's gland (glandula nasalis lateralis), which lies in the rostral maxillary sinus and its duct empties at the vestibule. This gland is homologous with the salt gland of marine birds. It produces a watery, nonviscous secretion at the nasal airway entrance where it may help to humidify inspired air and regulate mucus viscosity. Because of the large number of autonomic nerves that are found in close contact with its acinar cells, it is believed that this gland is regulated by the nervous system in such a way that rapid adjustment of the secretory activity to changes in the humidity of the inspired air or to airborne irritants is possible. Tracheal diameter is approximately 1.6 to 1.7 mm in the adult rat, and the shape is maintained by 18 to 24 rigid C-shaped cartilage structures that form the framework of the trachea. Tracheal length from the first cartilage to bifurcation is 33 mm and because of the cartilaginous rings, extension of the head of the rat can result in lengthening of the trachea by 50% with no decrease in lumen diameter. The lung in the newborn rat is immature and contains no alveoli or alveolar ducts; instead, gas exchange occurs in smooth walled channels and saccules, and the prospective alveolar structures. Once the rat reaches 4 days old, a rapid restructuring of lung parenchyma occurs so that by day 7, the lung is morphologically more mature. Respiratory bronchioles are also absent at birth but by day 10 are easily identified. Rats have the thinnest pulmonary artery and the thickest pulmonary vein of all rodent species. In the conscious resting rat, blood flow preferentially distributes to the central and hilar regions of the lung lobes, with less blood flow to the peripheral regions. Precapillary anastomoses between the bronchial and pulmonary arteries have been demonstrated in the rat, as they have been in man and guinea pig, and are limited to the hilar region in the rat. Innervation of the lung is complex, with high neuronal density similar to the calf, mouse, and guinea pig. The rat and rabbit do not have an adrenergic nerve supply to the bronchial musculature, and bronchoconstriction is controlled by vagal tone. At least 10 morphologically distinct cell types have been identified in the intrapulmonary airways. Rats possess serous cells in respiratory epithelium, which are unique to this species. These cells secrete a product that has less viscosity than the mucous cell, and is thought to be responsible for the low-viscosity pericilliary liquid layer found at all levels of the rat\u2019s respiratory tract.",

Although surfactant is composed of mostly monounsaturated phospholipids in many mammals, rat surfactant has a high content of polyunsaturated phospholipids. Carotid bodies located in the bifurcation of the common carotid artery function as chemoreceptors and respond when the tissue partial pressure of oxygen decreases to below 100 mm of mercury. Similar chemoreceptors located in the aorta are called aortic bodies, whose afferents travel via the vagi to the brain. Regulation of respiration occurs through tissue CO2 exchange in the medullary respiratory center, with the carotid bodies playing a role. Rats have high serotonin activity and low histamine activity in the lungs.",

These glands include 1 infraseptal, 2 nasoturbinate, 5 maxilloturbinate, 1 ventromedial nasal, 4 or 5 dorsal medial nasal, and the lateral nasal gland (Steno\u2019s gland). There are 4 endoturbinates and 3 ectoturbinates, unlike the rat which has 4 endoturbinates and 2 ectoturbinates. These very intricately folded turbinates project into the lumen of the nasal cavity and thus provide for an increased nasal mucosal surface. The trachea bifurcates at the height of the fourth rib pair into thicker right and thinner left main bronchi. Reisseisen\u2019s membrane, a layer of smooth muscle and elastic tissue, lines the lobar bronchi. The diaphragm originates dorsally on the first lumbar vertebrae and is composed of a well-developed pars muscularis and a transparent centrum tendineum. The pleura forms a large right and left sac surrounding the lungs. There are no respiratory bronchioles as in the rat and guinea pig, although the guinea pig and hamster have a transition to alveolar airways within a single generation that could be classified as producing one order of respiratory bronchioles. The conductive airways contain a limited number of glandular structures, primarily in the proximal trachea. The histologic appearance of the hamster trachea closely resembles the human bronchus. The pulmonary vascular bed is similar to that of humans in many ways, and hamsters develop pulmonary lesions that resemble human centrilobular emphysema. This similarity makes the Syrian hamster a potential model for studies of chronic bronchitis. Bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue, normally present only at the hilus of the lung in rodents, is absent in hamsters. Spontaneous bronchiogenic and pulmonary cancers are rare; hence, the Syrian hamster is a good model in which to study chemical carcinogenesis in the respiratory tract.",

Invasion of the middle ear occurs via the Eustachian tube and usually results in a chronic infection because the Eustachian tube opens into the tympanic bulla on the dorsal aspect, affording poor drainage to the nasopharnyx. Rats have cartilaginous rings only around primary bronchi. Damage to respiratory epithelium with ciliostasis and resultant accumulation of lysozyme-rich inflammatory exudate in the airways frequently results in weakening of bronchiolar walls and ensuing bronchiolectasis. Mycoplasma-associated host cell damage may occur by a variety of means, including uptake of essential cell metabolites and release of cytotoxic substances. Both the intact organisms and the cell membranes are nonspecifically mitogenic for lymphocytes. Thus, the marked lymphocytic infiltration seen in response to mycoplasmal infections does not appear to be due only to a response to a specific antigenic stimulus. The extensive lesions seen in some rat strains after exposure to M pulmonis may be attributable to an exaggerated and misdirected cellular immune response. The organism usually persists in infected rats, even in the presence of relatively high antibody titers. Microscopic changes in the affected tympanic bullae, turbinates, and major airways are characterized by a leukocytic infiltrate in the submucosa consisting of neutrophils, lymphocytes, and plasma cells. Peribronchial, peribronchiolar, and perivascular infiltration with lymphocytes and plasma cells is a prominent feature in all stages of the disease.

Mice are typically infected as 3- to 4-week-old juveniles and because of the ubiquitous nature of the organism, virtually all mice in the 4- to 12-week-old age groups should be considered to be infected and shedding. Immunity to the organism develops rapidly, with young animals being protected initially by colostral antibodies. Infection in susceptible mice proceeds slowly, leading to clinical signs of suppurative bronchopneumonia within several months. Primary signs include dyspnea and a hunched posture, which may be accompanied by wasting and scaly skin. Severe cases, such as those that occur with advanced disease, may be fatal. At necropsy, lesions are especially severe in SCID or athymic nude mice. Nonfilamentous trophic forms attach to type I pneumocytes with clusters of developmental stages spreading into the alveolar lumen. The lungs collapse poorly and have a rubbery consistency, with pale, patchy areas of consolidation. The type of pneumonia can be variable depending on the host\u2019s type of immune deficiency. Some ID mice may have very few visible cysts or alveolar exudation, with principally interstitial pneumonia. Histologic changes are characterized by interstitial alveolitis, with thickening of alveolar septa from proteinaceous exudate and infiltration with mononuclear cells. Immunocompromised mice subclinically infected with P murina that are inoculated with PVM develop severe respiratory tract lesions attributed to the dual infection. Superimposed viral infection and/or bacterial infections such as P pneumotropica can exacerbate pneumocystosis. Respiratory distress in ID mice should elicit suspicion of pneumocystosis.

This disseminated pattern of infection is exhibited by highly virulent strains of the virus in mice younger than 2 weeks, in genetically susceptible strains, or in immunocompromised mice. Dissemination occurs from the nasal mucosa to the pulmonary vascular endothelium and then to draining lymph nodes. Secondary viremia further spreads the virus to multiple organs. Immune-mediated clearance of the virus begins after 5 to 7 days, with no persistence or carrier state detectable beyond 3 to 4 weeks. The majority of natural respiratory/polytropic MHV infections are subclinical, with mild or no gross lesions. The obvious exception is ID mice, which cannot clear the virus and develop progressively severe disease with chronic wasting, or die acutely. Fetal infection with MHV is fatal, as is infection in na\u00efve nursing pups. In general, BALB/c mice are fairly susceptible whereas SJL mice are quite resistant. However, experimental infections clearly demonstrate that the biologic behavior of the wild-type MHV is unpredictable. Host immunity is decidedly virus strain dependent, which has given rise to the misconception that the virus has a latent phase. Recovery from one strain provides solid resistance to reexposure with the homotypic strain, but only partial to no resistance to infection with an antigenically heterotypic strain.

The location to which the infection extends into the respiratory tract is determined by mouse strain, differences in mucociliary clearance, virus burden, and kinetics of the immune response. SeV infects nasal, tracheal, bronchial, bronchiolar, and middle ear epithelium, and spreads to type II alveolar cells.

Proliferation with or without destruction of bronchiolar epithelium, increased cellularity of alveolar septa, proteinaceous exudation, and the presence of alveolar macrophages and neutrophils in bronchioles and alveoli are frequent findings during the acute phase of infection. Necrotizing bronchiolitis is a classic lesion. The sloughing of virus-infected bronchiolar epithelial cells corresponds with the appearance of measurable antibody.

Self-mutilation may occur as a result of scratching at the eyes and other affected areas, and very young animals may enucleate the globe. During the infection rats usually remain active and continue to eat, although certain behavioral activities may be suppressed; for example, pain may reduce food intake and complicate feeding studies. Glaucoma or persistent megaglobus may be permanent side effects in recovered animals. Infection may be exacerbated by concurrent SeV infection or mycoplasmosis, resulting in death. There may be high mortality associated with general anesthesia during the pneumonic form of the disease. Behavioral changes and reproductive disorders, including irregularities of the estrous cycle and neonatal mortality, have also been associated with epizootics of the disease. Athymic rats develop chronic, active lesions that persist in target organs for months, with accompanying wasting.",

Affected glands are enlarged, edematous, pale, and often reddened. The thymus becomes atrophic; however, this lesion and the chromodacryorrhea may be stress responses. The salivary, Harderian, and exorbital lacrimal glands may all be affected as a group or individually. Lesions are frequently unilateral, and paired salivary and lacrimal glands should be harvested for histopathologic examination. The glands will return to normal or become permanently scarred, depending on the severity of the infection and the degree of tissue damage, within 2 to 4 weeks of infection. Epithelial cells of the respiratory tract and ducts and acini of the glands undergo severe necrosis and inflammation. As the virus is eliminated from the lesion in about 1 week, the restoration process ensues. Harderian glands often have blotchy brown pigmentation with focal residual inflammatory lesions persisting for several weeks, resulting in prominent squamous metaplasia. During the reparative stages, cellular infiltrates of the affected glands are primarily lymphocytes, plasma cells, mast cells, and macrophages. In salivary glands, regeneration of acinar and ductal epithelial cells is usually completed within 3 to 4 weeks post exposure. In the respiratory tract, necrotizing rhinitis with mononuclear and polymorphonuclear cell infiltration occurs in the initial stages of the disease. Both respiratory and olfactory epithelium are affected, and although major repair is complete by 14 days post exposure, residual lesions may persist longer in specialized areas such as the vomeronasal organ. In the lower respiratory tract there is transient tracheitis, focal bronchitis and bronchiolitis with leukocytic infiltration, hyperplasia of respiratory epithelial cells, and flattening and loss of ciliated cells. Focal alveolitis, when present, is characterized by hypercellularity of alveolar walls and mobilization of alveolar macrophages. Lesions in the distal tract are transient, and usually dissipate by 8 to 10 days post exposure.",
