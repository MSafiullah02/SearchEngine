Managing trauma and elective surgery in India has been based on strategic recommendations provided by the Indian Orthopaedic Association (IOA),1 British Orthopaedic Association (BOA)2 emergency sub-speciality guidelines and Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India. However, as and when the pandemic wanes and stabilizes, a surge in orthopaedic patients is expected due to restrictions imposed by the pandemic including situations of trauma conditions which have been managed conservatively along traditional established orthopaedic principles and require a second stage corrective procedure.3 In India, both the public and private hospitals deliver trauma and orthopaedic services. There is a shortage of orthopaedic surgeons rendering care to people in India4 with a disproportionate surgeon to patient ratio along with lack of post-operative intensive care bed facilities.3 However, as we look forward, orthopaedic community and public health systems in India need to consider as to how one can provide the best care for patients in the post-acute stages of COVID-19, patients with trauma who could not have proposed surgery because of non-availability of facilities locally or no possibility of reaching to the higher surgical centres due to national lockdown along with those on current waiting lists for proposed elective orthopaedic surgeries.5\n,\n6 Currently physiological responses, mortality and morbidity in patients undergoing surgeries during the COVID-19 pandemic are still being published in literature.7\n,\n8\n",

Hence with minimal current literature available on complications, a balanced, pragmatic approach may have to be undertaken. Robust pre-operative assessment to evaluate surgical fitness will be necessary with the aim to reduce the risk of post-operative complications with medical evaluation supported by pre-operative assessment, detect asymptomatic carriage of COVID-19 and reduce the demand for post-operative intensive care facilities.11\n,\n21 It is the need of the hour that orthopaedic fraternity considering its high infectivity rates develop a chronological sequence of surgeries-a) surgeries which if not done in a month or so will cause impairment of limb function or make future surgery dangerous. (b) surgeries to improve lifestyle of patient and for more than one year old conditions can be withheld/deferred as of now unless patient function is seriously impaired that is he/she is bedridden/cannot walk in house also and (c) a different approach needs to be made for immunocompromised patients \u2013diabetes mellitus, chronic organic dysfunction, on chemo/radiotherapy.

Sufficient numbers of ventilators and high flow oxygen masks will also be required as a stand by necessity. Education of the staff is an essential tool in infection control and needs to be a multi-disciplinary approach.

A separate operative theatre complex should be dedicated for the surgery involving suspected or infected patients of COVID-19 for emergency surgeries. These complexes must have separate access, the other infrastructure, and a separate exit of its own. Rodrigues-Pinto et al.23 have given a detailed account of the surgical team flow for the orthopaedic surgery in a COVID-19 dedicated operating theatre and divided the complex into five zones: i) Entry dressing room, ii) Anteroom, iii) Operating Room, iv) Exit room, and v) Exit dressing room. These protocols must be followed as far as possible. The orthopaedic operation theatre must have a High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filter/Laminar flow with high frequency and rapid air changes, to reduce viral contamination. Minimum required number of staff and doctors must present during the surgical procedure inside the operating theatre. The orthopaedic tools and procedures which generate aerosols like drills, reamers, saw and electro-cautery must be minimally or not used. The need to have covers for power tools like those currently used for arthroscopy equipment's and how to dispose the irrigating fluid without floor or personnel contamination needs to be worked out.Also the need to shift to un-reamed intramedullary nails and hand reamers and hand drills to reduce the amount of AGP may have to be borne in mind. The operating team numbers and seniority will need to be judicious. There has to be a re-enforced established plan for thorough cleaning and disinfection prior to use of operating theatre facilities for patients in the new context of COVID-19 pandemic. It would be necessary to check that equipment such as anaesthesia machines used to intubate or ventilate patients are thoroughly decontaminated as per anaesthesia society and CDC guidelines. It would be better if surgeries are introduced in a phased manner as orthopaedic surgery are as a group known to have element of high infectivity rate depending on aseptic precautions undertaken. The operating theatre (OT) list should be less in number and some OT's should be kept as substitute e.g. that is if facility has four OT, then to use two on first day, decontaminate them, seal them and use the other two OT on the other day giving each OT a 24 h decontamination rest. The COVID operating facility for high suspect/hot zone patient and COVID-19 positive patient should be separate.",
