To control for correct isolation and amplification, all samples were spiked before extraction with internal control virus (murine encephalomyocarditis virus [RNA virus] and phocine herpes virus [DNA virus]) [23]. The fluorogenic probes recognizing the human respiratory viruses were all labelled with the 5\u2032 reporter dye FAM and a 3\u2032 quencher dye TAMRA, whereas the fluorogenic probes recognizing the internal control viruses were all labelled with the 5\u2032 reporter dye VIC.

The sampling methods used (combined nose-throat swab specimens instead of nasal wash specimens) may have influenced the results of viral culture, but probably only for the detection of RSV [27]. All of the SCT recipients in our study were adults, who are commonly believed to shed less virus than are children, which may result in lower rates of detection of respiratory virus by viral culture or rapid diagnostic tests, such as direct antigen detection [28]. Also, some viruses, such as coronaviruses, are difficult to culture in a routine laboratory [22]. Rhinoviruses were identified both by viral culture and by real-time RT-PCR as the major cause of URTI and were also detected in 3 patients with an LRTI (once in combination with a PIV). This outcome is not surprising, because in immunocompetent adults, rhinoviruses account for 30%\u201350% of the average 2\u20134 episodes of the common cold per year, and they are well known to occasionally cause LRTI in older adults and neonates [29, 30]. Rhinoviruses have been described before as causative pathogens of LRTI in immunocompromised patients [9, 17, 31], either as the sole pathogen or as a copathogen with bacteria or other respiratory viruses, although 2 recent studies that prospectively investigated the incidence of respiratory virus infections in patients with hematological cancer observed no or only a very low number of rhinovirus infections in cases of both URTI and LRTI [2, 24]. Rapid detection of rhinovirus infection could be of importance, especially in patients with LRTI, because it has been suggested that the antiviral drug pleconaril could be effective for the treatment of severe picornavirus infection, including infection due to rhinoviruses in SCT recipients [14].",

Although we were especially interested in adenoviruses that had recently been obtained from the environment and that had caused acute respiratory tract illness, one cannot determine whether samples obtained from the respiratory tract of SCT recipients will reveal recently obtained adenovirus infection or reactivated infection with latent adenoviruses from the lymphoepithelial tissue of the nasopharynx.",
