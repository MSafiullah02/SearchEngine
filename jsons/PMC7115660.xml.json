Although SARS has been successfully contained, re-emergence of SARS-CoV from animal reservoirs is still a potential risk for future epidemic, which is supported by continual reports of finding SARS-CoV-like coronavirus in small animals, such as civets, raccoon dogs [1], [2], [3] and bats [4], [5]. SARS outbreak may also recur in the future by the virus escaping from laboratory accidents [6], [7]. Therefore, development of safe and effective SARS vaccines for prevention of SARS-CoV infection is an important issue on current SARS research.",

These candidates can be grouped into inactivated viruses-based, protein-based, DNA-based and virus-based vaccines [18], [20], [21], [22], [23]. Many viruses, including VSV, rhabdovirus, adenovirus, adeno-associated virus (AAV), modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) and attenuated parainfluenza virus, have been used for expressing SARS-CoV S protein as SARS vaccine candidates [12], [15], [24], [25], [26], [27]. Bukreyev et al. [24] reported that vaccination of African green monkeys with an attenuated parainfluenza virus encoding SARS-CoV S resulted in production of SARS-CoV-specific neutralizing antibodies and protection of animals from virus challenge. These findings suggest that S protein of SARS-CoV is a good target for development of SARS-CoV vaccines.",

However, it may also elicit antibodies that enhance virus infection [25], [29] or cause liver damage in animals challenged with SARS-CoV [23]. In this regard, the receptor-binding domain (RBD), a fragment of the S protein, which has been demonstrated to be a major neutralization determinant, has implied to be an ideal candidate for development of subunit vaccines against SARS [30], [31], [32], [33], [34].

Although the full-length S protein-based vaccines can elicit neutralizing antibodies and/or protective immunity [13], [17], [20], it has been reported that this kind of vaccines may also induce harmful inflammatory and immune responses [23], [29]. This has raised concerns about the efficacy and safety of the vaccines containing or encoding the full-length S protein. We thus proposed to use RBD, a fragment of S protein, rather than the full-length S protein, for development of a safe and effective SARS subunit vaccine since it contains the major neutralizing epitopes [31], [32], [41]. Our previous studies have shown that the recombinant RBD can induce high potent neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV and its variants [31], [34], but we do not know whether the RBD-based vaccine can protect animals from SARS-CoV infection.",

We found that RBD-Fc elicited potent and long-term humoral immune responses in vaccinated mice. High titers of SARS-CoV S-specific ELISA antibodies and virus neutralizing antibodies were maintained for at least 6 months. Although the antibodies dropped to a low level at the end of the 12th month, their titers rebound rapidly after the mice were re-boosted with RBD-Fc. These vaccinated mice were protected from SARS-CoV challenge since no significant virus replication was detected in their lungs. Notably, presence of high titers of the neutralizing antibody was a prerequisite for protective immunity. Higher titer of neutralizing antibodies was associated with lower level of RNA copies/virus replication and stronger protective activity against SARS-CoV challenge. Among five mice vaccinated with RBD-Fc, four mice possessing high titer of neutralizing antibodies exhibited no significant virus replication and histopathological changes in their lungs while only one mouse with low sera neutralizing antibody titer showed marginal level of virus RNA copies, and mild histopathological changes. However, all of the five mice with undetectable neutralizing antibody in the control group presented high level of RNA copies/virus replication, and obvious histopathological changes in their lungs. Our results indicated that the neutralizing antibody produced in RBD-Fc vaccinated mice plays a significant role in protection of mice from the virus challenge without causing immunopathological damages.",
