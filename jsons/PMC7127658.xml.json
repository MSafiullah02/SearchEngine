The clinical presentation must be polysymptomatic and must include encephalopathy in the form of alteration in consciousness or behavioral change. Systemic symptoms, such as fever, malaise, myalgia, headache, nausea, and vomiting, are common precursors to the neurologic symptoms 1, 2. The etiology and pathophysiology of ADEM are not fully understood, but ADEM usually follows an infection of the upper respiratory tract or immunization in children and young adults. An autoimmune response to myelin basic protein, triggered by infection or immunization, is considered among the most likely etiologic factors 3, 4, 5.",

In the current series, 11 of 15 (73.3%) presented in winter or spring, consistent with seasonal infections as significant triggers for ADEM. Indeed, ADEM is often preceded by a viral or bacterial infection, usually in the form of a nonspecific upper respiratory infection. In three previous studies, an antecedent infection was identified in 72-77% of ADEM patients 5, 6, 10. In this series, 13 of 15 children (86%) presenting with the clinical and radiologic features of ADEM had a preceding acute febrile illness (10 upper respiratory tract infections and three cases of acute gastroenteritis). Thirteen of 15 children (86%) with ADEM may have been caused by seasonal variation in the infectious triggers. In general, ADEM symptoms present 7-14 days after a viral infection or immunization 5, 11. In this study, an average of 7 days separated the onset of acute febrile illness and the appearance of neurologic symptoms. The epidemiology of ADEM is similar across studies and patient populations, particularly the propensity of ADEM to appear following an upper respiratory tract illness.",

In this study, serologic evidence for specific triggers was found in five children: mycoplasma in two (in winter), Epstein-Barr virus in two (one in summer and one in winter), and influenza-A (H1N1) (in winter) in one. However, the vast majority of patients had no microbiologic diagnosis despite numerous laboratory investigations. Early recognition of pathogens is important because rapid treatment for this pathogen could have some positive effect 7. Oseltamivir and clarithromycin were administered in patients with influenza-A and mycoplasma according to the serology. This study shows the benefits of antiviral and antibiotic treatment initiated as soon as possible after the onset of illness.",

These children were treated initially with cefotaxime or another appropriate antibiotic and acyclovir until a diagnosis could be established. Encephalopathy is a characteristic feature of ADEM and may progress rapidly in association with multifocal neurologic deficits. The level of consciousness at presentation ranges from subtle lethargy to coma 5, 13. Encephalopathy in the form of alteration in consciousness was noted in 10 of the patients in this study and three exhibited lethargy, five exhibited stupor, and two were in a coma. Encephalopathy in the form of behavioral change was noted in five of the patients in this study, three of the patients had irritability, and two had mild confusion. Leake et al. 14 reviewed the cases of 42 children and adolescents with ADEM and noted that the majority exhibited multiple neurologic abnormalities, including lethargy, ataxia, an inability to walk, aphasia (slow, slurred, or decreased speech), cranial neuropathies, and abnormal reflexes (95% with hyperreflexia). The presenting symptoms in the current series (Table 1) were gait disturbance (12 cases), altered consciousness (10 cases), behavioral changes (five cases), fever (seven cases), headache (four cases), seizures (four cases), meningismus (four cases), and vomiting (three cases).",

New deficits within 3 months of onset are considered to be part of the same acute episode. Additional ADEM episodes occur rarely and happen in two main contexts: recurrent ADEM and multiphasic ADEM 2. The frequency of relapsing ADEM or ADEM progressing to MS has varied significantly among studies 14, 18, 20, 21, 22. One patient in the present study was considered to have possible MS based on clinical and radiologic recurrence. International consensus definitions for MS require two subsequent non-ADEM demyelinating events in children with an initial ADEM event 2. Banwell et al. 23 reported that 50-70% of pediatric MS cases had a polyfocal presentation and 30-50% had a monofocal presentation. Although MS is more commonly preceded by clinically isolated syndrome, there have been cases in which the initial presentation met criteria for ADEM. At what point a patient presenting with ADEM who has a subsequent event not associated with encephalopathy should be reclassified as MS remains unclear 2. On the other hand, a review of 1540 childhood cases of MS showed that the first attack was more likely to be characterized by polyfocal features and encephalopathy (ADEM-like) 23. A child with possible MS in the present study had altered mental status (lethargy) as well, so altered mental status was of no predictive value for subsequent MS in this series. Intrathecal synthesis of oligoclonal bands was detected in over 90% of children with MS 24. However, oligoclonal bands can be absent initially and are only detected later in the MS disease course 23, and the one case with possible MS in the current study did not exhibit oligoclonal bands.",

            "text": "MRI is a more sensitive modality for diagnosis of ADEM than CT 14, 20. Of the 14 patients who had head CT scans, only three exhibited lesions consistent with ADEM (Table 3) compared with 100% by MRI. This implies that ADEM is likely to be diagnosed with greater frequency as MRI becomes available in more regions and is used more often in pediatric medicine. The presentations of ADEM as revealed by MRI are variable. Lesions associated with ADEM are typically bilateral but may be asymmetric and tend to have poorly defined margins. Almost all patients in the current series had multiple lesions in the deep and subcortical white matter, while the periventricular white matter was generally spared. The thalamus and basal ganglia are frequently affected, and lesions in these locations are often symmetrical. Brainstem and spinal cord abnormalities on MRI are common in ADEM 8, 11, 13, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29. Only four patients featured isolated cerebral lesions, whereas the other 11 showed additional involvement of the brainstem (six cases), spinal cord (six cases), cerebellum (five cases), and thalamus (three cases). These lesion distributions, including common cerebral lesions in frontal and parietal subcortical white matter, are generally consistent with previous observations. Tenembaum et al. 8 divided ADEM MRI findings into four groups: small lesions (<5 mm), large confluent white matter lesions, symmetric bilateral lesions with thalamic involvement, and large demyelinating acute hemorrhagic encephalomyelitis. Liao et al. 30 suggest that ADEM is a broad spectrum disease and that patients showing bilateral large confluent lesions, focal demyelination lesions, or pure bilateral basal ganglia or bilateral thalamic lesions on MRI have classic ADEM and have a lower probability of progression to MS compared with patients with multiple small ovoid lesions. By this definition, all of the patients in the current study should be considered classic ADEM cases. Follow-up imaging after ADEM is typified by complete or near-complete lesion resolution and by the absence of new lesion formation. By contrast, follow-up imaging of MS usually demonstrates new, often asymptomatic, lesions 8, 10, 23, 31. Fourteen of the patients in the current study had complete or partial resolution of the lesions as evidenced by follow-up MRI. However, one patient had five new symptomatic or asymptomatic lesions (Table 3).",

ADEM has a wide range of neurologic presentations in children and should be considered in a child who develops multifocal neurologic abnormalities with encephalopathy following a febrile infectious illness. Early treatment with immunomodulative agents is recommended and is likely to result in a favorable outcome or even full recovery. On the other hand, this study shows the benefits of antiviral and antibiotic treatment initiated as soon as possible after the onset of illness. In 13 of 15 patients in this series, all neurologic signs and symptoms resolved after treatment. Only one patient recovered with severe neurologic sequelae and the remaining patient, who experienced recurrent attacks, was ultimately diagnosed with possible MS. It is still difficult to accurately predict progression to MS. Therefore, prolonged follow-up is required to establish a final diagnosis. Comprehensive long-term monitoring of such patients may provide additional information useful for etiologic insight and prognosis in this region.",
