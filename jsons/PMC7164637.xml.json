The S protein is a trimeric class I fusion protein that exists in a metastable\nprefusion conformation that undergoes a substantial structural rearrangement to fuse the viral\nmembrane with the host cell membrane (7, 8). This\nprocess is triggered when the S1 subunit binds to a host cell receptor. Receptor binding\ndestabilizes the prefusion trimer, resulting in shedding of the S1 subunit and transition of\nthe S2 subunit to a stable postfusion conformation (9). To engage a host cell receptor, the receptor-binding domain\n(RBD) of S1 undergoes hinge-like conformational movements that transiently hide or expose the\ndeterminants of receptor binding. These two states are referred to as the \u201cdown\u201d\nconformation and the \u201cup\u201d conformation, where down corresponds to the\nreceptor-inaccessible state and up corresponds to the receptor-accessible state, which is\nthought to be less stable (10\u201313). Because of the indispensable function of the S protein, it\nrepresents a target for antibody-mediated neutralization, and characterization of the\nprefusion S structure would provide atomic-level information to guide vaccine design and\ndevelopment.",

(Fig. 1B, fig. S2, and\ntable S1). Because of the small size of the RBD (~21 kDa), the asymmetry of this conformation\nwas not readily apparent until ab initio 3D reconstruction and classification were performed\n(Fig. 1B and fig. S3). By using the 3D variability\nfeature in cryoSPARC v2 (15), we\nobserved breathing of the S1 subunits as the RBD underwent a hinge-like movement, which likely\ncontributed to the relatively poor local resolution of S1 compared with the more stable S2\nsubunit (movies S1 and S2). This seemingly stochastic RBD movement has been captured during\nstructural characterization of the closely related betacoronaviruses SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, as\nwell as the more distantly related alphacoronavirus porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV)\n(10, 11, 13,\n16). The observation of this\nphenomenon in 2019-nCoV S suggests that it shares the same mechanism of triggering that is\nthought to be conserved among the Coronaviridae, wherein receptor binding to exposed RBDs\nleads to an unstable three-RBD up conformation that results in shedding of S1 and refolding of\nS2 (11, 12).",

S5) (20\u201323). Notably, amino acid insertions that\ncreate a polybasic furin site in a related position in hemagglutinin proteins are often found\nin highly virulent avian and human influenza viruses (24). In the structure reported here, the S1/S2 junction is in a\ndisordered, solvent-exposed loop. In addition to this insertion of residues in the S1/S2\njunction, 29 variant residues exist between 2019-nCoV S and RaTG13 S, with 17 of these\npositions mapping to the RBD (figs. S5 and S6). We also analyzed the 61 available 2019-nCoV S\nsequences in the Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data database (https://www.gisaid.org/)\nand found that there were only nine amino acid substitutions among all deposited sequences.\nMost of these substitutions are relatively conservative and are not expected to have a\nsubstantial effect on the structure or function of the 2019-nCoV S protein (fig. S6).",

A\n2019-nCoV RBD-SD1 fragment (S residues 319 to 591) was recombinantly expressed, and\nappropriate folding of this construct was validated by measuring ACE2 binding using biolayer\ninterferometry (BLI) (Fig. 4B). Cross-reactivity of the\nSARS-CoV RBD-directed mAbs S230, m396, and 80R was then evaluated by BLI (12, 29\u201331). Despite the relatively high degree of structural homology\nbetween the 2019-nCoV RBD and the SARS-CoV RBD, no binding to the 2019-nCoV RBD could be\ndetected for any of the three mAbs at the concentration tested (1 \u03bcM) (Fig. 4C), in contrast to the strong binding that we observed\nto the SARS-CoV RBD (fig. S8). Although the epitopes of these three antibodies represent a\nrelatively small percentage of the surface area of the 2019-nCoV RBD, the lack of observed\nbinding suggests that SARS-directed mAbs will not necessarily be cross-reactive and that\nfuture antibody isolation and therapeutic design efforts will benefit from using 2019-nCoV S\nproteins as probes.",
