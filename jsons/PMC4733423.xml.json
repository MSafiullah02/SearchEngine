            "text": "Human influenza viruses cause regular epidemics and occasional pandemics. During influenza epidemics, high attack rates of generally mild and self-limiting illnesses cause a substantial public health burden, and a small fraction of infections are severe, requiring hospitalization [1]. Community-based studies of influenza virus infection and transmission have provided detailed information on influenza epidemiology since the 1920s [2], with a series of seminal studies in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, the most comprehensive of which was the 10-year Tecumseh study of acute respiratory infections in households 3, 4. These studies conducted serologic and virologic testing of participants to determine the frequency of acute respiratory illnesses and identified the etiologic agents responsible. By enrolling entire households, these studies also examined transmission of respiratory pathogens, including influenza virus, identifying, for example, the importance of school-age children in introducing infections to the household [5].",

In a household cohort study, households are recruited prospectively from a sampling frame that typically includes the entire community, and some studies exclude households with one person. Participants in the study are then followed up prospectively across one or more influenza epidemic, or influenza season, to identify infections and illnesses. In many cohort studies, sera will be collected from participants before and after influenza epidemics, to permit identification of infections by, for example, the proportion of individuals with a 4-fold or greater rise in antibody titer against a particular strain across an epidemic of that strain 18, 19. During an influenza epidemic, or in some cases throughout follow-up regardless of influenza activity, participants may keep symptom diaries to permit estimation of the incidence of acute respiratory illnesses. Collection of nasal swabs or other respiratory specimens from ill participants, or at regular intervals from all participants regardless of illness [20], can permit virologic identification of specific pathogens causing those illnesses, including influenza viruses.",

            "text": "An advantage of household studies is the efficiency of simultaneously following up multiple individuals in households rather than separately following up the same number of people independently selected from the population. Compared with other types of close contacts, household contacts are easier to identify and follow up, and they provide a well-defined number of susceptible people that are likely to have been exposed to infection, compared with other settings such as schools, offices, or hospitals. Household cohort studies can also permit inference on the transmission dynamics of influenza in households, providing valuable data on transmission in the broader community because a substantial fraction of influenza virus transmission events do occur in households 21, 22. However, in many cohort studies infections are ascertained by serologic analysis, which can have imperfect sensitivity and specificity, and only provides what is known as final size data in which the number of infected and uninfected household members is known at the end of each epidemic [5]. Specialized methods have been developed to permit inference on transmission dynamics (who was infected by whom) based on final size data, allowing for the risks of acquiring infection from outside or inside the household 5, 23, 24. It can be challenging to explore heterogeneities in transmission dynamics due to individual characteristics, for example age, when only final size data are available [7]. In addition, it is not possible to estimate the serial interval based on final size data, although this epidemiologic parameter, measuring the average time between illness onset in an infected person and a secondary case infected by that person, is an important parameter for mechanistic models (also called mathematical models) of influenza epidemics that are often used for policy planning 22, 25. Some of these limitations can be ameliorated by careful collection of respiratory specimens from ill individuals, although intense follow up for illnesses over a prolonged period is challenging and demands considerable resources 26, 27.",

In a household transmission study of influenza, in contrast to a traditional cohort study as described above, households are eligible for enrolment only after at least one household member has been identified as having an acute influenza virus infection [34]. This case can be referred to as the index case, and the other members as household contacts, with caveats on this terminology discussed below. In contrast to cohort studies, household transmission studies typically involve a short duration of follow-up of participants for 1 or 2 weeks, or in some cases 1 month to permit collection of convalescent sera. Collection of respiratory specimens, such as nasal swabs or sera, from household contacts permits ascertainment of secondary infections in the households with laboratory confirmation, and symptom diaries provide information on illnesses. Differences between the cohort and transmission study design are illustrated in Figure 1\n. In principle, the transmission study is also a cohort study because it involves a defined cohort of individuals, but it differs from the traditional cohort study because only households with at least one infected person are included, and in theory the same household can be enrolled more than once (Figure 1). Further complicating the distinction, it is also possible to effectively nest a transmission study within a cohort study, by intensively observing participants in a traditional cohort study and initiating additional investigations once one household member becomes infected [35].",

One caveat of this design is that the identity of the person who first introduced infection into the household can be unclear, and may not necessarily be the person enrolled in the study as the \u2018index case\u2019. For example, in one household, the first infected person may have very mild illness that is not apparent, but is sufficiently infectious to transmit infection to a second person who has a more serious illness, seeks care at an outpatient clinic, and is enrolled as the index case. Finally, it should be mentioned that the definition of a household can vary between cultures. In western cultures, the household typically comprises a nuclear family, but in other cultures \u2013 and particularly in low- and middle-income countries \u2013 it is possible to find large extended families or social groups living together in compounds or small communities with substantial interactions that should not be ignored when analyzing transmission dynamics in the nuclear families.",

In a basic descriptive analysis, this is simply the proportion of household contacts that develop cases of confirmed influenza virus infection, or the proportion of household contacts that develop an acute respiratory illness. The SIR has frequently been referred to as the \u2018secondary attack rate\u2019 in the literature [36]. However, we note that infections do not necessarily cause more severe illness (attack) and the quantity in question is a risk, that is, a proportion, not an incidence rate with a person\u2013time denominator.

The person-to-person household transmission risk is usually lower than the SIR because of the additional risk of the household contact acquiring infection from another source apart from the index case [38]. Modeling studies and analyses of the homology in virus sequences between infections in index cases and household contact confirmed that almost all infections in household contacts in the short period after onset in an index case will have been acquired within households rather than from outside the household, confirming the feasibility and applicability of this study design to assess transmission within households 39, 40, 41, 42.",

The number of contacts with influenza-like illness (ILI), or the number of contacts with acute respiratory infection (ARI) in household contacts, can also be used to estimate the risk of secondary infections and illnesses. In published studies, there has been considerable heterogeneity in the reported secondary infection risks for laboratory-confirmed influenza and illness (Figure 2A). The secondary infection risks of PCR-confirmed infection among household contacts ranged from 1% to 38%, while those based on ILI ranged from 6% to 35%, and those based on ARI ranged from 3% to 31%. Some studies reported secondary infection risks based on more than one of these case definitions. Approaches to ascertaining index cases and then identifying infections and illnesses in household contacts likely contributed to the substantial heterogeneity in estimates of the secondary infection risk (Figure 2A). A previous review found that studies that collected respiratory specimens regardless of illness in household contacts reported higher secondary infection risks, compared with those studies that collected swab specimens only from symptomatic contacts [6]. Another potential explanation for the heterogeneity was that, in some studies, there was delay between symptom onset in index cases and the start of follow-up of households, and hence very small secondary infection risks were reported 56, 91. There is no reason to believe that there is a single true value of the secondary infection risk in a particular location since the degree of transmission that occurs in households will depend on the characteristics of the household members, the degree of contact between them, and the household environment.",

The effect of age has often been explored, with a younger age associated with higher susceptibility. While children generally have a higher risk of infection than adults [94], some studies failed to detect this association. Possible reasons include smaller sample size and hence insufficient statistical power to identify small-to-moderate effects. While one potential explanation for the higher susceptibility among children was the lower immunity in children on average, an identified study reported that age still had a significant association with susceptibility after adjusting for antibody titers [88], which is also supported by another household cohort study [7].",

While an antibody titer of 1:40 measured by hemagglutination inhibition is generally associated with 50% protection against infection 95, 96, 97, one study suggested that a hemagglutination-inhibition titer of 1:40 was only associated with 31% protection in the household setting [88], potentially because of exposures of greater duration or intensity in the confined setting of households. As more components of humoral immunity are quantified, by, for example, virus neutralization assays, neuraminidase-inhibition assays, or fusion-inhibition assays, the household transmission study may be a particularly efficient study design to validate the correlation of measurements from these assays with protection against infection or illness. In the same way, transmission studies could also be used to study cell-mediated immunity and innate immunity.",

While children are generally considered to be the main drivers of influenza transmission in the community, only a few household transmission studies have found that children were more infectious than adults to their household contacts. Other explored factors include the number of household contacts, and three studies reported that a lower number of household contacts was associated with a higher risk of transmission in households 35, 47, 62, while one study reported the converse association [61]. Some studies also explored whether the presence of particular symptoms was associated with higher infectivity and reported that cough 48, 49, 51, 71, 98, diarrhea 40, 48, fever [51], runny nose [98], or vomiting 40, 48 were associated with higher infectivity. All studies that explored gender relative infectivity reported no association of gender with infectivity 47, 49, 53, 55, 82. However, the association between particular symptoms and infectivity remains unclear as the number of studies exploring these was small (Table 1).",

However, some limitations of these studies should be noted. First, in a household transmission study, index cases are generally enrolled after presenting for medical attention and therefore are biased towards infections that cause more serious illness. If more severe illness was associated with greater transmissibility, then the estimates of transmissibility from household transmission studies may be overestimated. More generally, in household transmission studies it is not possible to estimate the total number of secondary infections in all settings caused by one index case (i.e., the reproductive number) because data are not collected outside the household. Second, because of the case ascertainment, households without any infections will not be enrolled (Figure 1), and it is not possible to estimate population-based rates of infection unless the transmission study is nested in a larger cohort study. Third, it is possible to characterize the mild end of clinical severity by assessing illnesses in household contacts, but severe disease is rare, and only very large transmission studies would be able to estimate, for example, the risk of hospitalization if infected with influenza.",

As we have discussed above, once one household member is infected with influenza, the risk of infection in a household contact can be up to 38%, and the delay between onset in index and secondary cases is around 3 days (Figure 2B). As new innovative approaches for data collection become available 10, 12, 102, it should be possible to improve and simplify data collection in household transmission studies. Although not discussed in this review, household transmission studies can also provide information on the severity of typical influenza virus infections. Whereas index cases, ascertained either by presenting for medical attention or reporting symptoms, are not likely to be representative of all natural infections, because milder cases would have a lower probability of being ascertained, the infections among secondary cases may give a representative picture of the severity of natural infections 40, 54, 83, 84. The fraction of infections that was asymptomatic varied from 0% to 21% 40, 42, 54, 66, 70, 82, 83, 84. A major outstanding question in influenza epidemiology, which could be addressed in large transmission studies, is whether these asymptomatic cases can transmit infection.",
