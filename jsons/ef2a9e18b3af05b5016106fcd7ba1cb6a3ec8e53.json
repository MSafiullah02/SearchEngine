Severity of COVID-19 for hospitalized patients was categorized as mild (oxygen saturation \u2265 94% on room air and no radiographic evidence of pneumonia), moderate (oxygen saturation < 94% or radiographic evidence of pneumonia) or severe (advanced oxygen delivery device use); severity was determined by the worst experienced during hospitalization. nausea/vomiting) were reported in 42%. Seventy-one percent were hospitalized with a median time to admission from symptom onset of 7 days (0-30 days). Three patients were diagnosed while already hospitalized with a median stay of 33 days (19-49 days) prior to diagnosis. Hospitalized patients were older (65 vs 39 years, p=0.02) and had at least one comorbid condition (66% vs 18%, p=0.047) compared to non-hospitalized patients.

Conventional therapy included supportive care, supplemental oxygen, hydroxychloroquine and/or azithromycin therapy, unless contraindicated. Advanced oxygen delivery devices include high-flow nasal cannula, non-rebreather, bilevel positive airway pressure or mechanical ventilation. In severe cases, intravenous glucocorticoid therapy was considered. Towards the peak of the pandemic, therapeutic anticoagulation was started in qualifying patients who did not have obvious contraindications. One patient was enrolled into a clinical trial.Laboratory values were collected at initial presentation during hospitalization.Elevations in liver tests were defined by an increase in serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels greater than 3x the Values presented as medians (range) or n, (column percentage %) *One patient was tested prior to endoscopy and the other was tested to determine hospital cohorting",
