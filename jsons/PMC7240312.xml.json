This may be because people are more likely to have closer contact with others because it is colder. It could also relate to relative humidity levels that are lower in winter. In Western countries, when it is cooler in winter, respiratory infections increase (eg, influenza). However, this seasonality does not apply to influenza in India.19 A study of a new strain of influenza in Vietnam shows that in the early years of this variant, there was significant transmission throughout the first year and the usual seasonal transmission pattern evolved a few years later.20 In Australia, it is summer and hot, and the COVID-19 is spreading here. This suggests that COVID-19 transmission may not be related to climatic conditions and may not be seasonal in its early year(s) as the population is being exposed for the first time.",

By studying seasonal variation and transmission within an infection cluster, it was shown that with vaccination of perhaps 5% of the population, the immediate case contacts was just as effective as vaccinating 100% of the population.23 Understanding the epidemiology of outbreaks proved to be the effective way of eliminating the disease.24 Recording all of the details of the COVID-19 outbreak is basic to understanding its epidemiology and the natural history of the disease and could provide the key to defeating the disease outbreak.",

The importance of preserving the physical and mental health and availability of health workers in an epidemic situation is very important. The quality of health care depends almost entirely on them having a professional service ethic that motivates them to provide the highest quality care to all with the resources available to them.25 This often leads them to put their own health and safety at risk, especially in infectious disease outbreaks. After the SARS outbreak of 2003 that caused illness and deaths among health workers, the ethics of exposing staff to the disease was still being debated in 2019.26 The history of public health is full of the writings of the heroism of health workers providing care to those in need, despite endangering themselves.27 However, experience has shown that risks associated with outbreaks of life-threatening infections only receive attention after health workers have suffered serious adverse consequences.

On campus, the usual precautions of avoiding contact, keeping distance, and frequent handwashing should apply. Within the memory of one of us (CB), these personal precautions were applied with success to polio, influenza, and hepatitis. We hope that these precautions will lead to a containment of the epidemic allowing time to continue development and clinical trials of a vaccine.",

The size of the outbreak will depend on reducing transmission, which at the present time means using traditional public health measures. These include contact tracing and quarantine of cases, or sometimes the quarantine of localities. Modeling suggests that these measures may be effective. Health promotion programs should emphasize avoiding crowds, handwashing and hygiene, and extensive testing of at-risk persons. Vaccine development is a slow process, and it will be a year(s) before it can become a component of public health interventions.",
