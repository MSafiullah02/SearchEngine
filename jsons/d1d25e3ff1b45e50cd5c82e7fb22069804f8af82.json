What they are suggesting, however, forces us to confront a long-standing tenet of our medical tradition. Namely, the primacy of the bedside clinical relationship. The relationship between clinicians and patients has long been understood to involve close contact, sometimes social, sometimes emotional, but often physical. As Osler admonished his students, \"Medicine is learned by the bedside and not in the classroom \u2026 See, and then reason and compare and control. But see first. \" (2) With the advent of increasingly abstract and technically sophisticated diagnostic and monitoring techniques, many have bemoaned the gradual erosion of physical examination skills among young clinicians (3) . A recent article in a cardiology journal asked, \"Should doctors still examine patients (4)?\" Paperwork, administrative burdens, high patient volumes, and increasing patient acuity have also chipped away at the time clinicians are able to spend at the individual bedside. The rapid growth of telemedicine, which promises both improved access and patient convenience (5, 6), may further distance clinician from patient.",

            "text": "We recommend the implementation of the following clinical distancing techniques: 1) Prioritize telemedicine for rapid assessment, triage, and patient routing: Many patients have concerns or questions that can be rapidly addressed using existing telemedicine platforms such as virtual visits. This offloading function has been effective in decompressing urgent care waiting times (10) . Official and concerted efforts should be made to encourage use of these systems as a clinical gateway, including diverting in-person clinic visits. Patients can then be routed to appropriate care. 2) Prioritize off-site, drive-through, or at home testing: An emphasis on low-contact testing for COVID-19 can reduce patient-patient interactions in waiting rooms as well as ease clinic staffing requirements. Many states have instituted drive-through testing sites (11) , and the technology for home testing may soon make this strategy feasible as well (12) . 3) De-emphasize the bedside care-team model: Clinics, emergency departments, and intake areas should reduce clinical interactions to a single clinician as much as possible. Patients often encounter multiple care team members as they move through check-in, triage, and rooming. Telemedicine should be used to facilitate interactions with additional clinicians or specialty consultants. Care updates should be provided electronically to patients or family members, even within patient care areas. 4) Minimize patient transfer and transport by using telecritical care services: Access to intensivists and specialist consultation allows patients to be managed where they are by local care teams, avoiding geographic spread and exposure of transport teams and vehicles. 5) Use telemedicine to protect high-risk clinicians and preserve the healthy clinical workforce: Organizations should dedicate some portion of the clinical workforce to telemedicine interactions, thereby establishing a cohort with a lower risk of exposure. Candidates might include clinicians who are at high risk themselves (older, chronically ill, immunocompromised, etc.) Clinicians who are well but placed under quarantine are also well-positioned to contribute by providing remote care.",

It is quite clear, however, that this is not the last time our health system will be threatened by large-scale epidemic or pandemic infection. It is also unclear what longerterm effects this current crisis will have on patient-clinician interactions and modes of care delivery. Emergency approval of billing for telemedicine services (13) may foreshadow a normalization of telemedicine as medicine. The longer-term impacts of the current crisis on clinical norms, which are social norms, will not be clear anytime soon (14) . In the meantime, we advocate the use of clinical distancing not as a new model for care delivery, but as a targeted and extendable measure that should be escalated, and just as importantly, de-escalated when appropriate.",
