The epidemiological reports were analyzed by epidemic intelligence service officers who participated in the MERS-CoV outbreak investigation. When a case was exposed to multiple confirmed cases, the transmission was attributed to the case with the highest likelihood of transmission, and any conflicts were resolved through the consensus of the epidemic intelligence service officers. Spreaders were defined as confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection that were epidemiologically suspected of transmitting MERS-CoV to 1 or more persons. Super-spreading events were arbitrarily defined as transmission of MERS-CoV infection to 5 or more cases. The patient who triggered the outbreak was defined as patient zero. Cases that were infected by patient zero were defined as first-generation cases; cases that were infected by first-generation cases were defined as second-generation cases; and cases that were infected by second-generation cases were defined as third-generation cases [14]. Isolation was defined as separating symptomatic patients from others to prevent spreading, and quarantine was defined as separating or restricting the movement of healthy individuals who may have been exposed to the infection within the maximum incubation period. The transmission date was defined as the date of contact between the spreader and suspected secondary case during the spreader\u2019s infectious period. In cases with an exposure duration of longer than 1 day, the transmission date was defined as the day with the highest likelihood of transmission or as the median day during the exposure period in cases with consistent contact throughout the exposure. The date of sampling was the day on which the first positive respiratory specimen was collected. Close contacts were defined using the Guidelines on Middle East Respiratory Syndrome [15], which include persons who stayed in a room or ward with a confirmed case, who directly contacted respiratory secretions from confirmed cases, or who stayed within 2 m from the confirmed cases without wearing appropriate personal protective equipment. Pre-isolation pneumonia diagnoses were based on radiographic evidence. Doctor shopping was defined as visiting multiple healthcare facilities without an official interhospital transfer after developing MERS-CoV symptoms [16].",

The reports were drafted during the outbreak based on direct interviews with the confirmed cases and follow-up epidemiological investigations that were performed to identify the exposure route and close contacts. Hospital information systems were reviewed to identify patients who stayed in the hospital during the exposure period and healthcare providers who contacted the patient(s). Persons who contacted confirmed cases outside healthcare facilities were also traced. Data from closed circuit television, credit card transactions, and health insurance services were also reviewed [5]. The numbers of close contacts were calculated based on the number of quarantines during the outbreak.

Furthermore, this high-risk period was temporally associated with other epidemiological factors. First, the period overlapped with the confirmed cases\u2019 visits to healthcare facilities, as hospitalization and ER visits peaked during days 4\u20137 after symptom onset. It is well known that MERS-CoV outbreaks generally occur in the healthcare setting [1, 5, 13, 20], and the high-risk period may be associated with healthcare-seeking behaviors. Second, the high-risk period was several days (1\u20134 days) after the radiographic diagnoses of pneumonia, which generally occurred on days 3\u20134 after symptom onset. Although the significance of pre-isolation pneumonia has not been discussed previously, a radiographic diagnosis of pneumonia may influence transmission in 2 ways. First, it may directly increase the chance of transmission by actively generating lower respiratory tract secretions and a productive cough. Second, it may be an indirect index of disease severity and hospital visiting status. In our study, cases with pre-isolation pneumonia had lower Ct values and more frequent pre-isolation hospital visits.",

The spreaders were typically isolated after the high-risk period (median, 7 days after symptom onset and 4 days after a diagnosis of pneumonia), whereas nonspreaders were typically isolated before this period (median, 3 days after symptom onset and 1 day after a diagnosis of pneumonia). Similar results were observed in a study of the SARS outbreak, which revealed that late admission to healthcare facilities (especially >4 days after symptom onset) was associated with super-spreading events [21]. Thus, infection prevention measures should target isolation before this critical period (ie, within 4\u20137 days after symptom onset and within 1 day after the detection of pneumonia). Interestingly, the average duration from symptom onset to isolation dropped to <4 days during the first week of June 2015, and reports of new cases have rapidly decreased since that time.",

The Ct value is a semiquantitative continuous variable that is inversely proportional to the viral load. Ct values are associated with the severity of MERS-CoV infection [22], although its relationship with transmission has rarely been studied. In the present study, spreaders had significantly lower Ct values compared to nonspreaders, which suggests that Ct values might reliably predict transmission. Moreover, the cases with very low Ct values (Ct <23) tended to transmit the infection in uncommon circumstances. In both the present study and previous studies, MERS-CoV transmission usually occurred in the hospital setting [1, 11, 13, 23]. In contrast, cases with very low Ct values transmitted the infection in more diverse settings in the present outbreak (eg, their household, in an ambulance, in an outpatient clinic, or to healthcare personnel after in-hospital isolation). These findings suggest that cases with very low Ct values can potentially transmit the infection in unexpected conditions. However, our data regarding the Ct values have several limitations. First, various amounts of phosphate-buffered saline were added to dilute the respiratory specimens, and this may have affected the Ct values. Second, the Ct value is influenced by the specimen type and the interval between symptom onset and sample collection [22, 24], but various different types of specimens were collected at different time points in the present study. However, we only evaluated 5 nonsputum specimens, and there was no linear correlation between the Ct values and the interval from onset to sampling.",

A similar finding was observed in a previous study of the SARS super-spreading event [4], with those super-spreaders having 11\u201374 contacts compared to 1\u20134 contacts for the spreaders with 1\u20132 transmissions.",

In addition, super-spreading events were associated with the number of healthcare facilities that each patient visited for hospitalization or ER treatment but not with the number of hospitals visited for outpatient treatment. In South Korea, patients who seek hospitalization without prior arrangements tend to visit the ER, and a history of 2 or more ER visits strongly suggests that the patient had been doctor shopping during hospitalization. Specific environmental conditions have been suggested to increase the likelihood of a super-spreading event [3], and doctor shopping may increase the likelihood of encountering these conditions. For example, when a confirmed case changes hospital during hospitalization without an official interhospital transfer, multiple environments are exposed to the infected case (an ambulance, an ER, and a ward). Thus, doctor shopping can greatly increase the likelihood of encountering conditions that are suitable for a super-spreading event. In the present outbreak, 4 of the 5 super spreaders (cases 1, 14, 16, and 76) transmitted the infection at 2 or more hospitals, as they had visited multiple healthcare facilities. Therefore, it is very important to have an early suspicion of MERS-CoV infection and minimize doctor shopping during the early stage of an outbreak.",

The source of infection was clear in >95% of the transmissions, and we excluded 3 cases that had contact with multiple cases and an unclear source of transmission. However, as the analyses of the epidemiological data are ongoing, the list of spreaders may change if new epidemiological evidence is uncovered. Second, we did not have access to genomic sequencing data, which might have provided information regarding the relatedness of transmitted strains. Third, transmission may be affected by other epidemiological factors, including aerosol-generating procedures, differences in environmental conditions, and variations in crowdedness [3, 13, 25]. However, these factors were not included in the present analysis. Fourth, serological testing was not performed for every close contact, and additional asymptomatic cases may have been present. However, the seropositive rate was 0.7% in a recent serological study of close contacts [26]. Thus, the absence of serological testing likely did not significantly influence our results.",
