Microbiologic confirmation was performed using either shell vial culture or direct immunofluorescent antibody testing as per institutional practice at that time. We further stratified those with RSV LRTI by possible or proven RSV LRTI.15 We defined possible RSV LRTI as RSV detection in the upper respiratory tract with new pulmonary infiltrates on chest imaging suggestive of viral etiology and proven RSV LRTI as any patient with RSV detected in the lower respiratory tract (obtained by BAL) and new pulmonary infiltrates on chest imaging suggestive of viral etiology. Because direct immunofluorescent antibody testing is less sensitive than PCR for the detection of RSV,19 it is possible that some patients with no detection of RSV in BAL fluid had proven RSV LRTI. Therefore, patients with no RSV detected in BAL were also considered to have possible RSV LRTI. BAL co\u2010pathogens were defined as non\u2010RSV organisms (virus, bacteria or fungus) that are known to cause pneumonia in humans. We defined neutropenia as an absolute neutrophil count < 500 cells/mm3 and lymphopenia as an absolute lymphocyte count < 200 cells/mm3. We considered patients who received ribavirin therapy prior to the diagnosis of LRTI as having received ribavirin at the URTI stage, and patients who received ribavirin therapy at the time of diagnosis of LRTI as having received ribavirin at the LRTI stage.",

Prior to 2001, 19 patients did not have images available for independent review. In those cases, the radiologist's interpretation, as documented in the medical record, was used. Bronchoscopy was performed in a dedicated endoscopy suite under the supervision of an experienced pulmonologist.20 The results from bronchial washing were excluded to minimize contamination from the upper respiratory tract.

Our mortality rate of 25% across groups is similar to other studies of HM patients with RSV LRTI. In patients with acute myeloid leukemia at our institution, 5/27 (19%) patients with RSV LRTI died.9 In contemporary cohorts of HCT recipients with RSV LRTI, the overall mortality ranged from 11%\u201030%.3, 5, 8, 10, 11 Allo\u2010HCT recipients often have high\u2010risk underlying malignancies and require immunosuppression as compared to auto\u2010HCT recipients.14 However, we found that mortality was high in all HM patients regardless of HCT status. This is similar to other groups who have found no difference in the risk for mortality between allo\u2010HCT and auto\u2010HCT recipients. Seo et al21found no difference in the risk for mortality between allo\u2010HCT and auto\u2010HCT recipients who developed LRTI with RSV, parainfluenza (PIV), influenza, or rhinovirus. Similarly, Renaud et al22 found that in a mixed cohort of patients with human metapneumovirus (hMPV) LRTI and RSV LRTI, overall mortality after RSV infection was high (35%), but there was no significant difference in mortality between allo\u2010HCT and auto\u2010HCT recipients, though the HR approached statistical significance (HR 5.2, 95% CI 0.7\u201039, P = 0.1). We found higher mortality among allo\u2010HCT recipients in one multivariate model that included neutropenia in lieu of lymphopenia as a marker of immune impairment, but this result was not reproducible in the other model that included lymphopenia. Furthermore, we found no difference in survival as assessed by Kaplan\u2010Meier analyses or by logistic regression.

In separate multivariate models, we found that lymphopenia and neutropenia were associated with 60\u2010day mortality. Lymphopenia is associated with increased progression from URTI to LRTI,13, 23 a well\u2010known marker of mortality.17, 24 Similarly, neutropenia is independently associated with progression to RSV LRTI.13 Conversely, normal lymphocyte counts are associated with low rates of progression to LRTI.23 Furthermore, we found that high\u2010grade immunodeficiency, as defined by ISI and SID criteria, was highly\u2010associated with mortality. Whether using ISI or SID criteria, high\u2010grade immunodeficiency was associated with a 60\u2010day all\u2010cause mortality around 50% after RSV LRTI, which is similar to prior studies. The initial development cohort for ISI consisted of 237 allo\u2010HCT recipients with RSV LRTI or URTI13 and mortality was high among those who did not receive ribavirin at the URTI stage and progressed to LRTI (63% at 90 days) and among those who presented with an LRTI and received ribavirin at diagnosis (50% at 90 days). Importantly, the ISI was developed in a cohort of allo\u2010HCT recipients and was designed to predict progression from RSV URTI to LRTI. As our current study shows, ISI is less useful in auto\u2010HCT recipients, particularly since certain criteria such as graft\u2010versus\u2010host disease may not be applicable. Similarly, a study of 45 patients with RSV LRTI found that high\u2010risk patients, as identified by ISI, had a RSV\u2010associated mortality of 50%.16 High ISI is also associated with high mortality after influenza infection.25 SID criteria were first studied in 34 patients with RSV infection, of whom 18% died.17 Risk factors for mortality included LRTI, pre\u2010engraftment status and vSID at RSV diagnosis. A recent study of SID criteria in 66 patients with RSV, PIV, and hMPV infection showed a mortality of 32% in patients with vSID, and no deaths in patients with MID or SID.

Furthermore, ribavirin given at the LRTI stage can still be beneficial in some instances, as demonstrated in few studies.8, 10, 27, 28 Despite the lack of statistical significance, there was a trend toward a protective effect of ribavirin for mortality in our cohort when given at the URTI stage in patients who eventually developed RSV LRTI.

This suggests that the subset of patients with RSV detected in BAL (ie, proven LRTI) should be distinguished from those without (ie, possible LRTI) as they may represent a distinct group with higher mortality where prompt and aggressive management may be desirable. Similar to our findings, Waghmare et al11 found that patients who had RSV detected in BAL fluid had higher mortality rates and a greater requirement for supplemental oxygen than those who did not. In addition, HCT recipients with PIV detected in BAL fluid had higher mortality than those with PIV detected in nasal wash alone (47% vs 3%).15 High mortality rates have also been demonstrated in immunocompromised patients with HM, with or without HCT, and detection of human metapneumovirus (43% in HCT recipients at 100 days),22 human rhinovirus (41% at 90 days in HCT recipients),21 and human coronavirus (35% at 90 days in HCT recipients and 14% at 90 days in HM patients without HCT)31 in BAL fluid.",

Not all patients were referred for bronchoscopy, so those with possible RSV LRTI may have been less sick, resulting in a referral bias. However, if patients were not referred because they were too sick to undergo bronchoscopy, this would bias our results towards the null hypothesis. We used viral culture and direct immunofluorescent antibody testing to detect RSV and other respiratory viral pathogens as this was the institutional practice at the time. Caution is necessary when extrapolating our findings to patients in whom respiratory viruses are detected using polymerase chain reaction assays. Though patients with no RSV isolation from BAL fluid were considered to have possible RSV LRTI, our Kaplan\u2010Meier survival analyses suggest that there is no meaningful difference in survival between those patients and those who did not have BAL, which supports the consolidation of those two groups of patients. It is also possible that we included patients with RSV infection and volume overload or other non\u2010infectious etiologies for pulmonary infiltrates. Misclassification of such patients would likely bias our results towards the null hypothesis if patients with volume overload were classified as having possible LRTI. Associations of ISI with mortality in auto\u2010HCT recipients should be interpreted with caution, since ISI was not developed to quantify immunodeficiency in auto\u2010HCT recipients. Because of the small size of the cohort and the small number of deaths (n = 39), we could not measure the interaction of proven RSV LRTI with immunodeficiency scoring, and our findings need to be replicated in a larger, prospective cohort.",
