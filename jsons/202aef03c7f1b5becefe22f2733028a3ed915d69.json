In contrast, with the healthy adult population, nasopharyngeal carriage rates range from 5% to 30%. Transmission of pneumococcus from children to household contacts or adults is the principal cause of nasopharyngeal carriage and the spread of antibiotic-resistant clones. Pneumococcus undergoes genetic transformation and can acquire DNA from other streptococci; during asymptomatic nasopharyngeal carriage, selection of resistant pneumococcus occurs especially in children, because they carry pneumococcus more often and for longer periods. Moreover, children are more frequently exposed to antibiotics. Interestingly, the use of fluoroquinolones in children is limited, because in animal models using young animals, development of articular cartilage damage in weight-bearing joints has been described [13, 14] . This adverse effect may explain why the rate of pneumococcus resistance to fluoroquinolones remains low. A direct correlation has been reported between the use of the fluoroquinolone antibiotics and prevalence of fluoroquinolone resistance in pneumococcus [15] [16] [17] [18] . Table 2 .1 describes the principal mechanisms of resistance to this antibiotic class by pneumococcus; Fig. 2 .1 shows the timeline of antimicrobial resistance of pneumococcus. ",

These compounds inhibit the final steps of peptidoglycan (cell wall) synthesis by binding to high-molecular-weight penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs). These antibiotics have a broad spectrum of activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. \u03b2-lactam antibiotics are considered to be time-dependent killers, meaning that increasing concentration significantly above the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) does not increase killing. The compounds have efficacy when concentrations are approximately four times the MIC of the microorganism. To determine the efficacy of \u03b2-lactam antibiotics, the preferred pharmacodynamic parameter is time (T) > MIC. For the majority of \u03b2-lactams, effectiveness is achieved at T > MIC for more than 40-50% of the dosing interval [19] . Amino acid alterations of the cell wall PBP result in decreased affinity for penicillin, which is the main mechanism of penicillin resistance. Several PBPs have been identified, including 1a, 1b, 2x, 2a, 2b, and 3. Alterations to the properties of PBPs are brought about by transfer of portions of the genes encoding the PBPs from other streptococcal species, resulting in mosaic genes [20] .",

Breakpoints established by the CLSI in 2012 for pneumococci defined penicillin resistance as: The breakpoints for penicillin susceptibility are based on three criteria: microbiological data, pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics of \u03b2-lactam antibiotics, and clinical outcome of pneumococcal infections. In a patient treated with a dose of intravenous penicillin, the levels achieved in the lung will be 100 times greater than those reached in the brain. Thus, use of low concentrations of \u03b2-lactam for pneumococcal infections, such as otitis media or meningitis, could lead to treatment failure. In contrast, with pulmonary infections the levels of \u03b2-lactam reached are generally sufficient to clear infection. Therefore, treating the same pathogen will require different doses of a given \u03b2-lactam depending on the site of infection. Likewise, we must considerer pneumococcal resistance in different sites of infection differently, and breakpoints for resistance will be different.",

There are two main mechanisms of macrolide resistance in pneumococcus. One involves target-site (ribosomal) alteration by an enzyme that methylates 23S rRNA, an enzyme that is encoded by the ermB (erythromycin-resistance methylase) gene. The resistance phenotype is called MLS B (macrolide, lincosamide, streptogramin B type) and is responsible for a high level of macrolide resistance. In a low proportion of cases, ermB gene variation that modifies the binding site for macrolides and lincosamides confers complete crossresistance to clindamycin [22] .",

The main mechanism of resistance to fluoroquinolones is mediated by amino acid substitutions in these two essential enzymes. As with other bacteria, resistant pneumococcus exhibits spontaneous point mutations in a region of GyrA (gyrase) and ParC (topoisomerase IV) called the quinolone resistance-determining region (QRDR). Some pneumococci may also exhibit an efflux-mediated mechanism, although the clinical significance is unclear. The presence of dual mechanisms of resistance has been reported in strains having high levels of resistance, often from cases of treatment failure [12, 42, 43] . In some cases multiple mutations in the target proteins accumulate [44] , which supports the idea that repeated antimicrobial challenge gradually erodes the effectiveness of fluoroquinolones.",

On the other hand, the American Thoracic Society (ATS)/Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) [46] recommends doxycycline for healthy patients with pneumococcal communityacquired pneumonia with low risk of drug-resistant pneumococcus and for patients with penicillin allergy [46] . The ribosomal protection protein (RRP), which binds to the ribosome and forces the drug from its binding site, is the main resistance mechanism of pneumococcus to tetracycline and doxycycline. This form of resistance is mediated by an alteration in the tetM gene. In 2012 a study by D\u00f6nh\u00f6fer et al. showed that TetM can directly remove and release tetracycline from the bacterial ribosome by an interaction between domain IV of the 16S rRNA and the tetracycline binding site [47] .",

A study by Ruhe et al. [61] regarding the duration of previous antibiotic treatment and its association with penicillin-resistant bacteremic infection revealed that the risk depends on the class of prior antibiotic exposure and the duration of therapy. The study analyzed 303 patients with pneumococcal bacteremia. In 98 (32%) cases of bacteremia caused by penicillin-non-susceptible S. pneumoniae, statistical analysis showed that the use of \u03b2-lactams, sulfonamides, and macrolides within the last 1-6 months before presentation was associated with penicillin-non-susceptible S. pneumoniae bacteremia (p < 0.05). In a second study with the same bacteremic population, Ruhe et al. [62] identified 33 (11%) cases of bacteremia caused by highlevel resistant S. pneumoniae. In these cases, three risk factors for high-level penicillin-resistant pneumococcal infection were identified: \u03b2-lactam antibiotic use in the previous 6 months, previous residence in a risk area (defined as stays in daycare facilities, prisons, homeless shelters, nursing homes, or other long-term care facilities), and respiratory tract infection in the previous year. Age extremes (<5 years or > 65 years) are a recognized risk factor for penicillinresistant pneumococcal infections [12, 17, 63] . As pointed out above, nasopharyngeal carriage of pneumococcus in healthy children ranges from 20% to 50%, and in the healthy adult population, nasopharyngeal carriage rates range from 5% to 30% [64, 65] . Consequently, it is not difficult to understand why several studies have shown that day-care centers are a risk factor for colonization and infection of children due to penicillin-resistant pneumococcus [66] [67] [68] . Similarly, institutionalized adults, especially those older than 65 years of age, have increased risk for penicillinresistant pneumococcal infections [69] . Moreover, the presence of specific comorbidities, such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and chronic pulmonary disease, especially chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), is a recognized risk factor for penicillin-resistant pneumococcal infection [58] .",

This work showed a modest relationship between consumption and resistance; additional factors were high population density and proximity to high-resistance regions, particularly for the development of multiple resistances in pneumococcus. In this Belgian population, the highest levels of resistance were to erythromycin, followed by resistance to tetracycline and penicillin; the highest prevalence of co-resistance to two antibiotics was for erythromycin-tetracycline.",

Antimicrobial drug use decreased (>15%) in Bulgaria, Czech Republic, France, and Germany, but it increased (>15%) in Croatia, Denmark, Greece, and Ireland. The most widely used antibiotics were penicillins (including broad-spectrum penicillins). Macrolides were the second most widely used category; the third consisted of cephalosporins, monobactams, and carbapenems. Fluoroquinolones occupied the fourth position. Four (France, Luxemburg, Belgium, and Portugal) of the six countries reporting the highest antimicrobial usage (Greece, France, Luxembourg, Portugal, Croatia, and Belgium) also reported the highest resistance proportions.",

The study also suggested that the heptavalent vaccine is failing to reduce antimicrobial resistance, possibly due to the increased consumption of azithromycin (p = 0.04).

Also, infections with pneumococcal serotypes such as 6A/B, 19A, 19F, 15A, 35B, 23A, 22F, and 33F were risk factors. Of these, the strongest risk factor is repeated exposure to antibiotic therapy. Figure 2. 2 provides a schematic explanation for how antibiotic resistance arises and spreads in bacterial populations. We conclude that the increasing prevalence of multidrug-resistant strains complicates treatment options for S. pneumoniae infections and in some cases resistance leads to treatment failure. ",

Several epidemiological studies suggest that relationships exist between specific serotypes/serogroups and the age of the host, site of infection, comorbidities, geographic region, pneumococcal invasiveness, and disease severity [105] [106] [107] [108] . As pointed out above, serotype differences also relate to antimicrobial resistance. The differing behavior among serotypes may reflect differences in nasopharyngeal carriage, with the highest rates in children, especially in the first year of life. As pointed out above, risk factors for nasopharyngeal carriage in children include winter season, age below 6 years, presence of younger siblings, and attendance in day-care centers. In adults, risk factors for nasopharyngeal carriage include cigarette smoking, asthma, and acute upper respiratory infection [64, 109, 110] .",

Twenty-four European countries reported susceptibility data for fluoroquinolones in 6263 isolates (57% of all reported pneumococcus isolates).

In contrast, Asian countries reported higher levels, from 10% to 12%. For example, a study from Hong Kong that analyzed antimicrobial resistance data for S. pneumoniae from the period 2001-2007, using samples from respiratory tissue, wounds, blood, and other fluids, reported that 11% had reduced susceptibility to levofloxacin [32, 120] . Similarly, a prospective surveillance study of 2184 S. pneumoniae isolates collected from patients with pneumococcal infections from 60 hospitals in 11 Asian countries from 2008 to 2009 reported resistance to fluoroquinolones at 1.7%, 0.4%, 1.5%, and 13.4% for levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, gatifloxacin, and ciprofloxacin, respectively (Kim et al.

The study by Whitney et al. [123] demonstrated that the PCV7 vaccine prevents invasive disease in both healthy and chronically ill children. Despite the success of PCV7, studies have noted an increase in the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) caused by non-vaccine serotypes, such as 1, 3, 5, 6A, 6C, 7F, 12F, 19A, and 22F [124] . These serotypes are related to penicillin-non-susceptible clones. The emergence of serotype 19A, which correlates with high-level penicillin and multidrug resistance, is a main concern globally [125] . This serotype presents a dual macrolide-resistance phenotype (erm B and mefA).",

PCV13 contains capsular polysaccharides from serotypes 1, 3, 4,6A, 7F, 9 V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F , and 23F. In March 2010, the Advisory Committee for Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommended that PCV13 replace PCV7 for the vaccination of children. New studies show a similar reduction in IPD following the introduction of the PCV13 vaccine, as seen previously with the PCV7 vaccine. The study by Moore et al. [126] analyzed IPD cases (33,688 cases, of which 89% contained serotyping results) during July 2004-June 2013 and classified as being caused by the PCV13 serotypes against which PCV7 has no effect (PCV13/nonPCV7). The work found a reduction in IPD in adults associated with PCV13 introduction in children. In all adult age groups, PCV13/nonPCV7-type IPD (especially serotypes 19A and 7F) declined by 58-72%, which was comparable to that observed early after PCV7 introduction. The PCV13 led to overall reductions of IPD of 12-32% [126] . However, the phenomenon of serotype replacement, which is thought to be caused by non-vaccine serotypes (NVT) that occupy nasopharyngeal natural niches vacated after pneumococcal vaccination, is again observed with pneumococcal serotypes 11A, 15A, 23B, and 35B, the most frequent serotypes. Serotypes 15A and 23B show a high proportion of penicillin non-susceptibility [127] .",

Several studies showed that treatment failure in CAP cases does not occur when appropriate therapy and doses are used, even in those patients infected with non-susceptible strains and treated with \u03b2-lactams. For example, in 2010 a Spanish study analyzed 1041 patients with pneumococcal pneumonia in which 114 (11%) presented septic shock. The main risk factors were current smoking, chronic corticosteroid therapy, and serotype 3 pneumococcus. No difference was found regarding genotypes or patterns of antibiotic resistance between patients with or without septic shock [128] . Similarly, a study by Morgandon et al. [129] , concerning severe pneumococcal pneumonia in patients admitted to intensive care units (ICU), reported that risk factors for mortality were age, male sex, and renal replacement therapy. Comorbidities, macrolide administration, concomitant bacteremia, or penicillin susceptibility did not influence outcome in these cases. These studies suggest that the outcome with community-acquired pneumococcal pneumonia is probably associated with the clinical presentation of pneumonia rather than the antibiotic resistance of the pneumococcus strain. A plausible explanation is that antibiotic concentrations achieved in the lung are usually higher than the pneumococcal MIC for more than 40-50% of the dosing interval, even with resistant strains. It will now be interesting to determine whether infection by strains having a very high level of resistance to \u03b2-lactams (MIC \u2265 16 \u03bcg/ml) correlates with clinical failure with pneumonia patients.",

Therefore, continuous surveillance programs are needed to determine optimal empiric treatment for a given locality. Surveillance programs are also needed to control the impact of pneumococcal campaigns on serotype distribution, emergence of non-vaccine serotypes, and antimicrobial resistance.",

At approved doses, some reach infected tissues more effectively than others. These properties need to be carefully defined to guide clinical use. For example, with compounds that induce mutagenic responses, rapid killing is likely to be important. Additional insight may emerge from geographical locations that use particular derivatives and have very high rates of resistance. A clear example of this is the resistance of pneumococcus to macrolides. In Europe the main resistance mechanism is the ribosomal mutation that confers high resistance to macrolides, whereas in the United States, the dominant mechanism of resistance is active efflux, which confers low levels of resistance to macrolides. These data suggest the importance of clinical studies in different geographical areas before recommending particular antibiotics. A completely different question is how to slow transmission among young children and elderly persons in long-term care facilities. Solutions may involve reducing antimicrobial consumption, the main driver of newly acquired resistance.",

The prevalence of co-resistance to erythromycin-tetracycline was 26.7% in the period 2002-2003 and decreased slightly to 25.9% in 2004. The overall antibiotic consumption in Belgium was 26.4 DID (daily doses per 1000 inhabitants per day) in 1995 and decreased slightly to 23.3 DID in 2004. The most frequently consumed antibiotics were broad-spectrum penicillins (9 DID in 2000 to 6.4 DID in 2004). Macrolides showed a similar pattern (6 DID in 2000 to 4.5 DID in 2004) as did cephalosporins (4.7 DID in 2000 to 3.7 DID in 2004).
