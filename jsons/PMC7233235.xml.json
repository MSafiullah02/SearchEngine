            "text": "The decision to graduate a resident/fellow says to the certifying board, credentialing bodies, perhaps a future program director and, most importantly, the public that the individual is able to perform all medical, diagnostic, and surgical procedures considered essential for the area of practice (PR - IV.B.1.b).(2) and that the individual has demonstrated the knowledge, skills, and behaviors necessary to enter autonomous practice (PR - V.A.2.a).(2).(b)). The implications for the program are substantial. That individual will always \u201cwear a badge\u201d that says, \u201cI graduated from ABC program,\u201d and the image of program ABC in the eyes of the profession will be affected \u2013 positively or negatively - by the performance of that individual. The program also has an important obligation to the individual. Imagine giving a pilot\u2019s license to an individual who was truly not prepared to fly an airplane. It would be unfair to that individual who could be killed or injured without even knowing that they were not ready to fly an airplane. By graduating a resident or fellow who is not ready for independent practice, the program director puts at risk the professional well-being of that surgeon by inviting failure in the certification examination sequence, credentialing actions, medical-legal actions, and the self-realization of unintentional harm to patients. Most importantly, giving a license to an ill-prepared pilot would be tremendously unfair to anyone who chose to go up in a plane with that pilot, or who happened to be unlucky enough to be at the exact spot where that pilot\u2019s plane makes a sudden unplanned (otherwise known as \u201ccrash\u201d) landing. In surgery, the graduation of a resident/fellow who is not truly ready for independent practice puts the patients who will be treated by that individual at risk. It is a tremendous abrogation of the program director\u2019s responsibility to the public and should be a \u201cnever event\u201d.",

            "text": "The decision not to graduate a resident/fellow on schedule also has implications. For the public, there is a slight delay in 1 surgeon entering the workforce. For the institution sponsoring the program, there are financial implications. Having exceeded the number of years typically associated with first certification in the specialty, the full payment of Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and other graduate medical education funding will not be available for that individual and must be come from another source. That source is typically clinical income. Another very real consideration for the program is the ripple effect on other residents/fellows in the program. If a resident\u2019s/fellow\u2019s graduation is delayed due to insufficient technical ability, that resident/fellow would presumably devote most of the remedial period performing operations. For most programs, operations are not an unlimited resource. The operations done by that resident/fellow in the remedial period would not available to be performed by other enrollees who would otherwise be progressing through the program at the expected pace. For the remediated resident/fellow, delayed graduation may result in the postponement of further professional education (ie fellowship) and/or of entering practice. As a result, the receipt of anticipated income would be deferred, which may, then, result in deferred repayment of educational and/or personal loans and other debt obligations. With delayed graduation there may well also be a degree of personal stigma among colleagues, friends and even family members.",

That fact should always guide a program director\u2019s decision regarding the graduation of each resident/fellow and, in making that decision, the program director should judiciously weigh all available evidence regarding the suitability of the candidate to safely practice surgery without supervision. No resident/fellow should be allowed to graduate from a program simply because the calendar day has come on which she/he was anticipated to graduate when matriculating into the program.",

            "text": "This is written in April 2020. The previously projected date of graduation more than 4,900 residents in the 7 core surgical specialties (the 7 specialties that have not historically required earlier completion of general surgery residency include neurological surgery, obstetrics and gynecology, ophthalmology, orthopaedic surgery, otolaryngology, urology and, of course, general surgery) and almost 2,000 residents and fellows in 32 surgical subspecialties is less than 4 months away. However, we now find ourselves in the midst of a pandemic unlike any seen for more than a century and, at this writing, the peak incidence of COVID-19 cases has not yet been reached. Mitigation efforts, including social distancing, are currently in force in most parts of the nation. A mitigation effort specific to surgery is the cancellation of elective operations. The cancellation of elective operations and other invasive procedures was called for by the American College of Surgeons on 13 March6, then by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services7 and the American Hospital Association8 5 days later. With very few exceptions (eg the subspecialty of orthopaedic trauma) the surgical specialty and subspecialty programs accredited by the ACGME rely heavily upon elective procedures as educational resources for enrolled residents and fellows. It is unclear at this time when elective procedures may be resumed. Their return will predictably vary by location and institution. Even within a given institution there will predictably be a period of ramping up to the pre-pandemic volume of elective procedures. The social distancing aspect of the mitigation effort has also resulted in elimination of all but essential physical clinic and office visits, thereby disrupting the ability of residents/fellows to evaluate patients with surgical diseases and other problems. With reduced procedural and outpatient volumes, some surgical residents/fellows in institutions with large volumes of COVID-19 patients have been reassigned to non-surgical duties. This is particularly true for those residents/fellows who have had any significant education and experience in critical care. Some residents/fellows are functioning under a \u201cplatooning\u201d schedule whereby they are on duty in the hospital for a certain number of days then off duty for a like number of days. Such schedules are possible because of greatly decreased surgical demand and simultaneously advantageous by virtue of decreasing exposure of residents/fellows to infection with the virus. Other surgical residents/fellows are essentially idle at this time, other than remotely attending available educational conferences and self-study pursuits. The pandemic has resulted in the postponement or cancellation of the nationally administered in-training examinations of some specialties/subspecialties and of examinations in such educational programs as the Fundamentals of Laparoscopic Surgery\u00a9, the Fundamentals of Endoscopic Surgery\u00a9 and others required by the certifying boards.",

It is likely that many programs will find it difficult or impossible to hold spring meetings of their Clinical Competency Committees. Those that do meet will have to reckon with fewer than the usual number of performance evaluations of residents/fellows in the final stages of their education. They will also have to contend with case logs that contain a diminished number of cases, overall, and certainly fewer complex operations that would normally be accomplished by a resident/fellow approaching graduation. Indeed, many will have to contend with the fact that the residents/fellows spent their last scheduled months in the program providing little or no surgical care.",

The duration of the core surgical specialty programs and integrated residency programs ranges from 4 to 7 years. The duration of the fellowship programs, though, is only from 1 to 3 years. A truly unfortunate fact is that more than 1,050 of the individuals who would have been anticipated to graduate in June-July 2020 are enrolled in 1-year fellowship programs. Should the pandemic significantly affect their hospitals and other clinical sites for 3 months, those individuals will miss performing elective procedures for one fourth of the scheduled duration of their fellowship programs. In missing what should have been the final 25% of their time to perform elective procedures, it is highly likely that they will miss more than 25% of the elective procedures that they would have performed since they would predictably be doing more \u2013 and more complex \u2013 cases in the last half of their year than in the first half.",

Whether the program should graduate a resident/fellow who has substantial experiential deficiency of any type is a very different question. A resident/fellow should be allowed to graduate only if the program director can personally verify that \u201cthe resident/fellow is able to perform all medical, diagnostic, and surgical procedures considered essential for the area of practice\u201d and that the individual \u201chas demonstrated the knowledge, skills, and behaviors necessary to enter autonomous practice.\u201d These are weighty and often difficult decisions to make which should invoke soul searching on the part of program directors even under normal circumstances. The limitations imposed upon the education and evaluation of many residents/fellows by the pandemic are far from normal and even further from optimal. The diploma of graduation from a residency/fellowship program and the final evaluation written by the program director cannot be marked by asterisks or otherwise be conditional. They cannot say, \u201cThis resident/fellow demonstrated the ability to practice independently in the specialty of ABC Surgery except for the following procedures:\u201d and they cannot say, \u201cThis resident/fellow probably would have been able to demonstrate the knowledge, skills, and behaviors necessary to enter autonomous practice had it not been for the pandemic.\u201d Furthermore, the program should not pass a graduate on to another program, a partner or an employer with the understanding that the graduate will be mentored or proctored in specified areas of deficiency. Once the graduate leaves the program, the program has no way of ensuring that such mentoring or proctoring will be provided. Indeed, the program has no assurance that the graduate will actually enter the program, partnership, or employment that was planned. The diploma from an ACGME-accredited program must be an unequivocal declaration of the program director that the graduate has demonstrated the ability to safely practice the specialty autonomously.",

Are audition rotations indispensable for the evaluation of candidates for the program? Can the best candidates for the program be identified using virtual interviews? Are conferences held remotely as effective as educational tools as those held in person? Is each of the curricular areas specified in the Program Requirements of a given specialty crucial to the practice of that specialty? Or, are some of them there because they are historic vestiges, merely desirable or just because they can be? Are the numbers right for each of the case minima? Are each of the case minima necessary for a program to be able to appropriately educate residents/fellows, or might the transferability of skills between different operations be recognized by more broadly grouping case categories? Are each of the requirements for entry into the board certification process necessary and correctly set? The experience of the last 2 months has fostered support for accelerating the transition to a true competency-based system of graduate medical education. Unfortunately, declaring that an educational system is competency-based does not make it so, and many substantial obstacles must be overcome in the transition to such a system. The momentum for that transition is greater now than ever before but those obstacles cannot be overcome in the next 3 months and will not be overcome in the next academic year.",
