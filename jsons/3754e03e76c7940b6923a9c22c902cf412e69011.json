Human-to-human transmissions, 33 as well as asymptomatic transmissions of the infection, have been confirmed. As of April 3 rd, 34 public health crisis in China due to COVID-19 is potentially under control. We compiled a 35 daily dataset of case counts, mortality, recovery, temperature, population density, and 36 demographic information for each prefecture during the period of January 11 to April 07, 37 2020 (excluding Wuhan from our analysis due to missing data). Understanding the 38 characteristics of spatiotemporal clustering of the COVID-19 epidemic and R0 is critical in 39 effectively preventing and controlling the ongoing global pandemic. The prefectures were 40 grouped based on several relevant features using unsupervised machine learning 41 techniques. We performed a computational analysis utilizing the reported cases in China to 42 estimate the revised R0 among different regions for prevention planning in an ongoing global 43 pandemic. Finally, our results indicate that the impact of temperature and demographic 44 (different age group percentage compared to the total population) factors on virus 45 transmission may be characterized using a stochastic transmission model. Such predictions 46 will help prioritize segments of a given community/ region for action and provide a visual aid 47",

Certain strains of Coronavirus are known 68 to cause infections in humans and have led to previous epidemics, such as severe acute 69 respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) (2). A new strain 70 of Coronavirus called the COVID-19 has led to a global epidemic since its emergence in 71 Wuhan, China (3). As of May 17, 2020, this disruptive pandemic has been spread among 180 72 countries and infected >4.6 million individuals and caused >0.31 million deaths since the onset 73 of the epidemic. Nearly 0.084 million cases were diagnosed in mainland China (4, 5). The 74 epidemic in China is now under control. 75 76 Initial efforts to stall transmission of the COVID-19 by the Chinese authorities included the 77 closure of the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market which was considered to be the focal point 78 of the outbreak (6). However, in spite of such strong intervention attempts, the rapid spread of 79 the virus could not be prevented. Apart from measures to prevent exposure to the source, 80 diagnostic recognition of the virus is an essential part of preventing efforts to prevent 81 transmission. Diagnostic tests for COVID-19 were developed after isolation of the virus from 82 lower respiratory tract specimens and blood serum (7).
