Understanding how infectious diseases spread in our society is crucial to the development of strategies for disease control. A mathematical model of infectious disease, called the susceptible-infected-removed (SIR) model, was first applied with the assumption of a well-mixed population for computation of the final numbers of infected and eventually removed (or recovered) individuals [1]. So far, many mathematical models of infectious diseases have been proposed for understanding the spread of epidemics and proposing strategies for disease control [2].",

Diseases spread over the networks of physical contacts between individuals, and the structure of real networks [4\u20137] has crucial effects on this spread. For example, Moreno et al.\n[8] studied the SIR model in a scale-free network having a degree distribution of pk\u221dk\u2212\u03b3 using a degree-based mean-field approach. Their approximation clarified that epidemics can spread over the network for any infection rate if \u03b3\u22643. In addition, many analytical approaches for epidemic models with network structures, such as the approximation onto a bond percolation problem [9,10], the edge-based compartment model [11], the effective degree approach [12], and the pair approximation [13,14], have been proposed and have succeeded in describing epidemic dynamics. Numerical simulations have revealed how epidemics spread in more realistic situations. Also, several strategies for disease control have been proposed on the basis of the knowledge of epidemics on networks, e.g., target immunization [15,16], acquaintance immunization [16\u201319], and graph-partitioning immunization [20].",

In contrast, there have been few studies on epidemic models with finite fractions of seeds. Miller [21] considered the SIR model in networks with large initial conditions to resolve an apparent paradox in works assuming an infinitesimal fraction of seeds. Hu et al.\n[22] numerically studied how the positions of multiple seeds in a network affect spreading behavior. Ji et al.\n[23] identified multiple influential spreaders in real networks by ranking nodes in disintegrated networks after random bond removals. What we discuss here is a more fundamental, but almost overlooked problem: How do epidemic models with finite fractions of seeds undergo phase transitions? For SIR-type epidemics, each infection seed creates an epidemic cluster of infected individuals. Epidemic clusters generated by multiple seeds will have global connectivity in some parameter regions even though each seed may not have the potential to induce a global outbreak there.",

An epidemic cluster grows from each of multiple seeds. We regard the clusters so generated as supernodes and study the percolation problem of these supernodes. Indeed, we can analytically and numerically obtain the percolation transition point of supernodes to show a gap between this transition point and the epidemic threshold. The existence of this gap indicates that the percolation transition of epidemic clusters occurs before a single seed can induce a global outbreak. Our result also shows the sensitivity of the seed fraction on percolation transition points, i.e., that a small seed fraction drastically reduces the critical infection rate for the emergence of the infinite epidemic cluster.",

The system evolves as a continuous-time Markov process. As an initial-state configuration, a fraction, \u03c1, of the nodes is randomly chosen to be seeds and is initially infected, while other nodes are susceptible. The infection rate is denoted by \u03bb. When an infected node is adjacent to a susceptible node, this susceptible node gets infected with probability \u03bb\u0394t within a short time, \u0394t. Note that this probability is independently given by each of the infected nodes so that the total infection rate at a node is just proportional to the number of infected neighbors. An infected node becomes removed at a rate \u03bc, i.e., with probability \u03bc\u0394t within a short time \u0394t, irrespective of the neighbors' states. Without loss of generality, we set \u03bc=1 unless otherwise specified. The dynamics stops when no infected nodes exist in the network.",

Above \u03bbcSIR, a single seed can induce global outbreaks. In a global outbreak, a nonzero fraction of nodes become infected and eventually removed. Below \u03bbcSIR, the number of removed nodes is always negligible compared with the total number of nodes. As already mentioned, we have several approaches for obtaining \u03bbcSIR (see the recent review [3]); Newman approximated the SIR model in uncorrelated networks by mapping onto a bond percolation problem (which is called the SIR model with transmissibility) [10] and derived \u03bbcSIR as\n(1)\u03bbcSIR=\u2329k\u232a\u2329k2\u232a\u22122\u2329k\u232a,where \u2329k\u232a and \u2329k2\u232a are the first and the second moments of the degree distribution, pk, respectively [24]. This result indicates that, for a fat-tailed scale-free network whose degree distribution obeys pk\u221dk\u2212\u03b3 with \u03b3\u22643, a global outbreak starting from an infinitesimal fraction of seeds occurs even for an infinitesimal infection rate. As indicated in [25], mapping onto a bond percolation problem does not give the exact outbreak size or probability, but it does predict exactly the epidemic threshold. Lindquist et al.\n[12] proposed an effective degree approach for describing the time evolution of the SIR dynamics using numerous ordinary differential equations and derived the same epidemic threshold, (1). Miller [11] introduced another approach by means of the edge-based compartment model to enable accurate descriptions of the SIR dynamics accurately with a few rate equations.",

We call the connected components of removed nodes and susceptible nodes the R components and the S components, respectively. For the SIR model in networks with \u03c1\u22730, we have two percolation transition points, \u03bbc1 and \u03bbc2. When the number of nodes, N, is much greater than 1, the mean fraction of the largest R component, rmax(N)=Rmax(N)/N, where Rmax(N) is the mean size of the largest R component, changes from 0 to a nonzero value at the former point \u03bbc1. Note that \u03bbc1 corresponds to \u03bbcSIR in the limit \u03c1\u21920 by definition. Percolation analysis of an epidemic cluster starting from a single seed has been used for numerical computations of the epidemic threshold and critical properties [26,27]. The latter point, \u03bbc2, is on the percolation of the S component (also called the residual graph [28,29]) and is usually larger than \u03bbc1. Above \u03bbc2, the network remaining after removal of the R components is disintegrated such that the sizes of all remaining components are finite. In other words, the mean fraction of the largest S component, smax(N)=Smax(N)/N, where Smax(N) is the mean largest S-component size, is 0 (nonzero) for \u03bb>\u03bbc2 (\u03bb<\u03bbc2) when N\u226b1. Whether the susceptible nodes are globally connected is important because a second epidemic spread may occur in the remaining network [28,30]. In [28], Newman analyzed this second transition point of the SIR model with transmissibility in uncorrelated networks with \u03c1\u21920 to show that the transition point is positive even when \u03b3\u22643. Valdez et al.\n[31] proposed a new strategy for suppressing epidemics by regarding this second transition point as a measure of the efficiency of a mitigation or control strategy. If we regard the present model as showing the propagation of an attack against a network, such as a computer virus, \u03bbc2 is a measure of the robustness of networks against such attacks [32,33]. Konno and the authors numerically studied \u03bbc2 for correlated networks to show that any positive or negative degree correlation makes networks more robust [33].",

The extension to degree-uncorrelated networks having degree distribution p(k) may be straightforward, although its execution will be cumbersome. At any rate, our findings obtained from the RRG probably will be in common with other networks. In Sec.

Using sl,0(\u221e), we obtain the degree distribution of the S components as\n(13)pls=1ssl,0(\u221e),where the denominator s=\u2211l=0ksl,0 is the prior probability of being susceptible.

The excess degree distribution, qls, which is the probability that a randomly chosen link from S components points to a (susceptible) node with excess degree l, is (l+1)pl+1s/\u2211l\u2032(l\u2032+1)pl\u2032+1s.

In these simulations, we set \u03bc=1, \u03c1=0.01, and N=3002,4002,5002,6002. Each of data is averaged over 50 000 trials. The two vertical lines represent \u03bbc1=\u03bbc2\u22430.91 (left) and \u03bbcSIR\u22431.17 (right), respectively. Here \u03bbc1=\u03bbc2 was confirmed by the crossings of \u03c8R and \u03c8S and their finite-size scalings, and \u03bbcSIR was obtained from the Monte Carlo simulations for the SIR model with a single seed (not shown).",

Let consider the probability p\u2113(k) that an infected node infects \u2113 nodes of k susceptible neighbors before being removed [(a)\u2192(d)]. The probability that this infected node is removed before infecting any neighbors [(a)\u2192(b)] is p0(k)=1/(1+k\u03bb). On the other hand, the event that this node infects one susceptible neighbor [(a)\u2192(c)] occurs with probability 1\u2212p0(k)=k\u03bb/(1+k\u03bb). At (c), the focal infected node infects further \u2113\u22121 nodes from k\u22121 remaining neighbors before being removed [(c)\u2192(d)] with probability p\u2113\u22121(k\u22121) because the infecting process is Markovian.
