[17] In the SEIR model, we assumed that no individual had the immunity against COVID-19 in the study setting. We assumed 2 nd March 2020 as day zero, when the first index case reported. There was no data available on parameters of COVID-19 disease in Indian community; hence we used the data from international studies. The parameters included were incubation period (5 days) [4, 18, 19] of COVID-19, time needed for recovery from disease (7 days for Mild disease and 15 days for severe disease), and time of death from the onset of symptoms (18 days). [18] Studies reported that the average infectious period was 10 days [20] with 30% of the cases showing no symptoms. [21] As per the estimates given in literatures, around 80% of symptomatic persons experience mild disease, 20% experience severe disease; 5% need admission in ICU and 3.8% of them may die due to COVID-19.

These findings also highlight that due to high proportion of asymptomatic cases and limited capacity of health system to trace and test all contacts of positive cases; case-based interventions are having limited scope in flattening epidemic curve. To have a better outcome we need to combine both case-based and community-based approach. These findings are further supported by evidences from European countries, compiled by imperial collage COVID-19 response team. [28] The study conducted by Koo et al also showed that combined interventions including case based approach and community level interventions were more successful in flattening the pandemic curve. [29] The findings suggests that, even though lockdown showing better results compared to other interventions, implementing it for short duration would not show the better results. Case isolation with lockdown for 21 days delayed peak of pandemic by 3 more days compared to case isolation combined with social distancing but still showed higher number of prevalent cases on peak day. To have better outcome lockdown should be continued for longer duration. If it implemented for short duration, loss may outweighs the benefits of the intervention.",

Therefore, while estimating the number of cases, effect of community level interventions were applied to both asymptomatic and symptomatic cases and effect of individual level interventions were applied only to symptomatic cases. In multiple interventions scenario, effect of community level interventions on R t was estimated first, and effect of individual level intervention applied to R t of community level intervention.",
