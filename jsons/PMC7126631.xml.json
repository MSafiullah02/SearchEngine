            "text": "It is estimated that about 50% of cancer patients will receive palliative radiotherapy during the course of their disease [1]. Radiotherapy is highly effective and therefore commonly used in the palliation of bone metastases, with an overall and complete pain response rate of 70 and 30%, respectively 2, 3, 4. However, controversy exists on the optimal dose-fractionation regimen for the treatment of bone metastases 5, 6. Many randomised clinical trials (RCTs) on dose-fractionation schedules have concluded that a single fraction provides equal pain relief as multiple fractions in the treatment of uncomplicated bone metastases 3, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15. The first two large, multicentre RCTs confirming equivalence were published in 1999 3, 8, and were followed by the publication of two meta-analyses of 12 studies in 2003 4, 16. On the basis of these empirical results, in 2004 the Province of Ontario published evidence-based guidelines that recommended the use of single-fraction radiotherapy in the management of uncomplicated bone metastases [17]. However, contemporary surveys on the patterns of practice in North America, Europe, Australia and Southeast Asia suggested that radiation oncologists continue to use multiple fractions in the treatment of bone metastases 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31.",

This was evident by increased waiting times for radiation services, a concern for provincial health policy decision-makers, clinicians, and patients. Limited resources may be better used if patients with bone metastases are treated with a single fraction assuming equivalence of single and multiple fractions of radiotherapy in providing pain relief [34]. Moreover, two of the three surveys on patient preference showed that patients preferred the most convenient and effective treatment modality and most preferred shorter courses of palliative radiotherapy for bone metastases 35, 36.",

For the purpose of this study, the dose-fractionation regimen for each patient was coded as a binary variable, where 1 = single fraction and 0 = multiple fractions. For patients who had more than one independent course of radiotherapy for bone metastases during the study period, one course of radiation was randomly selected using a table of random numbers. To determine whether the use of single-fraction radiotherapy changed over time, the chi-square test was used. The chi-square test was also used to detect differences in proportions between unordered categorical variables, including gender, travel distance, primary cancer site, site of radiotherapy, prescription of single or multiple fractions, radiation oncologist, and year of certification of radiation oncologist across time. Continuous interval variables, such as age and travel distance, were tested across time using the analysis of variance (ANOVA). Univariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify patient, treatment and organisational variables significantly associated (P\n \u2264 0.05) with the use of single-fraction regimens. In these models, multilevel categorical variables were dummy coded with the following reference groups: female for gender; lung for primary cancer site; near for travel distance; spine for radiotherapy site group; and 2000\u20132005 for year of certification of radiation oncologist. We then carried out a multiple logistic regression analysis to examine the effect of the year of treatment (1999 was the referent group) on the use of single radiotherapy, after adjusting for gender, age, primary cancer site, KPS, travel distance to cancer centre, site of radiotherapy, and year of certification of radiation oncologist. Covariates were included in the final model if they were hypothesised to be related to the prescription of single-fraction radiation across time and the final model was selected based on the highest r\n2 value, a statistical indicator of the best fit of a model.

This may not be a true reflection of the prescription patterns of oncologists in the RRRP in 2005. First, data were only collected until 31 July 2005, resulting in few courses of radiotherapy during the 2005 time period included in the study compared with other years. As such, cases have been overlooked, which may have non-differentially biased results towards a greater proportion of multiple-fraction treatments in 2005 compared with 2004. Second, there were more patients with lung cancer treated in 2005 compared with the other years, with a smaller proportion of prostate cancer patients. However, this was adjusted for in the multivariable regression model. Furthermore, information on ongoing clinical trials during each time was not collected.

Haddad et al.\n[41] conducted a review of dose fractionations used in the treatment of bone metastases at the Palliative Radiation Oncology Program (PROP) at Princess Margaret Hospital (PMH) in Toronto, Ontario. Like RRRP, PROP provides quick access to palliative radiotherapy at a large radiation treatment centre. PROP patient profiles were comparable with those of the RRRP in terms of primary cancer site, gender, age, and skeletal sites of metastases. Overall, single-fraction radiotherapy was used with greater frequency among the 693 evaluated RRRP patients when compared with the 882 PROP patients (65% vs 32%, respectively) [41]. In both clinics, the most frequently prescribed single- and multiple-fraction treatment regimens were a single 8 Gy and 20 Gy/five fractions, respectively. In PROP, the use of single-fraction radiotherapy generally increased between 1998 and 2000, from 37 to 43%, but declined again in 2001 to 26%. As indicated in Fig. 1, the relative proportion of use of single-fraction radiotherapy was much higher in the RRRP during the same period (50.9 and 70.8% of all radiotherapy cases in 1999 and 2001, respectively).",

In 2001, a survey of radiation oncologists at PMH was conducted to investigate factors guiding the prescription and fractionation practices for bone metastases [42]. The survey found that only 28% would prescribe single-fraction radiation for bone metastases. Eighty-eight per cent and 40% reported using performance status and age, respectively, to guide their choice of dose-fractionation schedule. Less than 10% of the oncologists used the location of the lesion in the vertebrae or weight-bearing bones. A survey conducted in the UK in the 1980s found that radiation oncologists who normally prefer single-fraction radiotherapy for the palliation of bone metastases would use multiple fractions for cases involving younger age (e.g. \u226440 years), cervical spine metastases, neurological symptoms associated with spinal metastases, diagnoses of a single bone lesion, and lytic metastases [21]. On the other hand, oncologists who normally prefer to use multiple fractions of radiotherapy would use single-fraction radiation for cases involving older patients (i.e. \u226570 years), patients who travel further for treatment, temporary waiting lists and resource availability pressures, rib metastases and lung cancer patients [21].",

Although the administration of a single fraction was hypothesised to be more likely for patients who travelled further distances from their residence to the centre, after adjusting for all other covariates, distance was not a significant factor in the dose-fractionation regimen prescribed. The results also suggest that the experience of the radiation oncologist has a quantitatively greater influence on the use of single fractions than the year of treatment (odds ratios of 6.356 and 3.905 for oncologists certified in the 1970s and 1980s, respectively, compared with 2.619 and 3.473 for treatments in 1999 and 2001, respectively). It is not expected that there is a cohort effect, where more experienced oncologists who are trained in earlier years may be more likely to give single-fraction radiotherapy or be more likely to base clinical practice on empirical evidence. More experienced oncologists trained in earlier years may be more confident in knowing and applying the results of empirical evidence to clinical practice. However, the observed differences in the prescription patterns between oncologists warrant further investigation. It is difficult to confidently ascertain whether the increased use of single-fraction radiotherapy over time in the RRRP was due to the effect of empirical evidence and recommendations in the literature or due to other factors, such as personal preferences of the radiation oncologists, patient preferences, or other patient and tumour-related characteristics not examined here.",

Because one course of palliative radiation was randomly selected for patients, some cases may have been overlooked. It is difficult to know whether previous courses of radiotherapy confounded the use of single or multiple fractions for all subsequent treatments for bone metastases. Similar to the PMH review [41], estimates of patient survival and life expectancy by the treating radiation oncologist were not consistently available in patient records and were not included as potential covariates in the dose-fractionation prescription. Data on waiting times from referral to radiotherapy consultation were not collected in this study. It is hypothesised that this variable could influence the use of single or multiple fractions across time, depending on the pressure of radiation waiting times within the radiotherapy department as well as within the RRRP clinic. In the PMH review, waiting times for radiation were not found to influence the use of single or multiple fractions [41]. Also, specific tumour characteristics were not recorded, such as the lesion type (lytic, blastic, or mixed), the date of diagnosis of the primary cancer site and bone metastases, the number of bony lesions, or other sites of metastases and the extent of disease, as these data were inconsistently available in electronic patient records. Furthermore, data on the field size of radiation delivered were not collected in this study, which could have influenced the oncologist's decision for dose-fractionation choice. These disease-related factors may have influenced the dose-fractionation prescription patterns. Lastly, data on radiation oncologist sub-specialties were not collected in this study.",

The results of this study suggest that practice significantly changed in the RRRP after the publication of influential RCTs and recommendations for treatment. There was an increase in the prescription of single-fraction radiotherapy for painful bone metastases over time in the RRRP. The most significant changes followed the publication of the two large RCTs and two meta-analyses confirming equivalence in pain relief between single and multiple fractions in 1999 and 2004, respectively. Potential contributing factors to dose-fractionation schedules included the site of bone metastases and physician-related factors. An obligation exists to use the most cost-effective treatment plan that provides equivalent outcomes [30] in order to provide the best medical care and to optimise resources in both publicly and privately funded regions of the world. Recently, increased use of single-fraction radiotherapy in the treatment of bone metastases has been shown to reduce overall radiotherapy workload in the UK by 6% [34]. Reductions in radiation workload allow for an increased availability of radiation resources, which has the potential to reduce radiation waiting times for patients who have the potential for cure, where the time of access to radiation is essential to prevent tumour growth and metastasis [43]. Patients may also benefit from the use of single-fraction radiation, being spared additional travelling and treatment time. Many studies have already promoted and advocated the use of single-fraction radiation 5, 44, 45, 46. We also advocate the use of single-fraction radiation, but acknowledge the need for an individual case-based management for complicated bone metastases. Further research in the management of patients with complicated bone metastases is needed to determine when the use of multiple fractions is most appropriate, such as the controversy in the dose fractionation used for neuropathic pain or spinal cord compression.",
