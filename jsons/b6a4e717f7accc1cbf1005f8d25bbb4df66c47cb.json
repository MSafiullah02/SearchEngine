Previous studies investigating community-level relationships between plant functional trait characteristics and stream environmental characteristics remain scarce. Here, we used community-weighted means to identify how plant traits link to lowland stream typology and how agricultural intensity in the catchment affects trait composition. 2. We analysed plant trait characteristics in 772 European lowland streams to test the following two hypotheses: (i) trait characteristics differ between plant communities in small and medium-sized streams, reflecting adaptations to different habitat characteristics, and (ii) trait characteristics vary with the intensity of agricultural land use in the stream catchment, mediated either directly by an increase in productive species or indirectly by an increase in species that efficiently intercept and utilize light. 3. We found that the communities in small streams were characterized by a higher abundance of light-demanding species growing from single apical meristems, reproducing by seeds and rooted to the bottom with floating and/or heterophyllous leaves, whereas the community in medium-sized streams was characterized by a higher abundance of productive species growing from multi-apical and basal growth meristems forming large canopies. 4. We also found indications that community trait characteristics were affected by eutrophication. We did not find enhanced abundance of productive species with an increasing proportion of agriculture in the catchments. Instead, we found an increase in the abundance of species growing from apical and multi-apical growth meristems as well as in the abundance of species tolerant of low light availability. The increase in the abundance of species possessing these traits likely reflects different strategies to obtain greater efficiency in light interception and utilization in nutrient-enriched environments. 5. Synthesis and applications. Our findings challenge the general assumption of the EU Water Framework Directive compliant assessment systems that plant community patterns in streams reflect the nutrient preference of the community. Instead, light availability and the ability to improve interception and utilization appeared to be of key importance for community composition in agricultural lowland streams. We therefore suggest moving from existing approaches building on species-specific preference values for nutrients to determine the level of nutrient impairment to trait-based approaches that provide insight into the biological mechanisms underlying the changes. We recommend that existing systems are critically appraised in the context of the findings of this study.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Ecological theory suggests that multiple environmental factors shape local species assemblages by progressively filtering species from the regional species pool to local communities.

Despite a general decline in nitrogen and phosphorus loads to freshwater ecosystems in Europe during the last two decades, concentrations are still beyond those considered critical for freshwater ecosystems (Soer 2010) . Furthermore, the influence from agricultural emissions is expected to increase in the coming years. This is due to a projected increase in nitrogen fertilizer use by around 4% in 2020 combined with an increasing proportional role of agriculture for phosphorus loss through progressive implementation of the Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive mitigating phosphorus loss from point sources (Soer 2010) .

Several important physical characteristics that are known to affect plant compositional patterns change according to stream size (Haslam 1978) . These include an increase in discharge, velocity, channel width and depth and a decrease in light availability with increasing stream size (Sand-Jensen et al. 2006) , whereas substratum characteristics, which also play an important role for the plant composition in streams (Butcher 1933; Baattrup-Pedersen & Riis 1999) , vary more unpredictably with stream size (Sand-Jensen et al. 2006) . Considering that plant compositional patterns reflect the filtering of the regional species pool to local environmental conditions, we hypothesize that multiple functional characteristics of the plant communities will respond to stream size. Specifically, we expect to find traits characterizing helophytes living in the transition zone between land and water to be proportionally more abundant in small streams than in mediumsized streams. This will be reflected in a higher proportion of emergent species growing from apical meristems and regenerating from seeds and a higher proportion of species with heterophylly (a specific adaptation to maximize resource uptake at changing water levels) in small compared to medium-sized streams. On the other hand, traits characterizing hydrophytes should be proportionally more abundant in medium-sized streams, indicated by a higher proportion of submerged species forming large and dense canopies and of species that are tolerant of lower light availabilities. Since submerged species exhibit a number of adaptations to life in water, including mechanical fragmentation with subsequent regeneration of whole plants from the fragment and the ability to form specialized buds or turions which survive winter when the rest of the vegetative parts decay (Hutchinson 1975) , we also expect that these traits will be proportionally more abundant in the plant community in medium-sized streams than in small streams.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 464, "end": 477, "text": "(Haslam 1978)", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 619, "end": 644, "text": "(Sand-Jensen et al. 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 754, "end": 768, "text": "(Butcher 1933;", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 769, "end": 799, "text": "Baattrup-Pedersen & Riis 1999)", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 843, "end": 868, "text": "(Sand-Jensen et al. 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF60"}, {"start": 2166, "end": 2183, "text": "(Hutchinson 1975)", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Additionally, we expect that the functional characteristics of the plant communities will be influenced by agricultural intensity in the catchments. Eutrophication is one of the most widespread environmental problems in freshwater ecosystems. Yet, the mechanisms driving changes in plant composition along nutrient-enrichment gradients in streams and rivers remain unsolved (Demars et al. 2012) . Here, we test two non-mutually exclusive hypotheses with the aim to identify the main mechanism causing these changes (Fig. 1 ). The first hypothesis suggests that eutrophication directly promotes productive species with fast growth, building on the assumption that nutrients are limiting for plant growth (Carignan & Kalff 1980; Mesters 1995; Mainstone & Parr 2002) . This assumption also forms the framework for existing plant-based WFD-compliant assessment systems building on expert knowledge of the nutrient preferences of single species (Holmes et al. 1999; Birk & Wilby 2010 ; see Demars et al. 2012 and references therein) . Provided that the main drivers for changes in community composition under eutrophication are nutrients, we expect to find an increase in the proportion of highly productive plant species with increasing nutrient availability. According to Grime (1988) , this should be reflected in an increase in the proportion of species with an ecological preference for high nutrient levels (high Ellenberg N) as well as an increase in tall species forming dense standing crops with extensive lateral spread. The second hypothesis suggests that the main driver of changes in community composition is light limitation caused by increased water turbidity and biofilm growth in addition to enhanced aquatic plant growth (Sand-Jensen 1990; Hilton et al. 2006 ). According to this hypothesis, we expect to find an increase in the proportion of species that can compete efficiently under lightlimiting conditions. This can be accomplished either by concentrating the photosynthetic biomass in the uppermost waters by possessing apical growth and/or by producing floating leaves, which both serve to maximize light uptake, or by having efficient light utilization so growth can be maintained under low light availabilities (low Ellenberg L).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 374, "end": 394, "text": "(Demars et al. 2012)", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 703, "end": 726, "text": "(Carignan & Kalff 1980;", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 727, "end": 740, "text": "Mesters 1995;", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 741, "end": 763, "text": "Mainstone & Parr 2002)", "ref_id": "BIBREF47"}, {"start": 940, "end": 960, "text": "(Holmes et al. 1999;", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 961, "end": 978, "text": "Birk & Wilby 2010", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 985, "end": 1027, "text": "Demars et al. 2012 and references therein)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1269, "end": 1281, "text": "Grime (1988)", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 1734, "end": 1752, "text": "(Sand-Jensen 1990;", "ref_id": "BIBREF59"}, {"start": 1753, "end": 1771, "text": "Hilton et al. 2006", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 515, "end": 522, "text": "(Fig. 1", "ref_id": "FIGREF0"}], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "In this study, we used plant data from a total of 772 stream sites situated in 13 countries in central and western Europe and the Baltic region.

These traits are likely to provide a clear advantage for species growing in the land-water ecotone. Generally, freshwaters have a low and fluctuating supply of carbon dioxide as well as generally low light availability and these resources often limit growth in streams (e.g. Maberly & Madsen 2002) . Therefore, plants that can reach the water surface during the growth period and get access to atmospheric carbon dioxide may have a strong competitive advantage. Heterophyllous species not only have access to atmospheric carbon dioxide, they also have leaves with lower surface area-to-volume ratios under water compared to those that are at or near the water surface (e.g. Callitriche palustris; Alisma plantago-aquatica; some Ranunculus species), which may contribute to maximizing the carbon dioxide uptake both below and above water. Besides these structural and morphological adaptions to life in water, physiological adaptations exist to overcome potential carbon limitation. In particular, the ability to use bicarbonante in photosynthesis is an Table 3 . Groups of species sharing similar distributional patterns and ecological trait characteristics identified by performing a hierarchical clustering analysis based on the Euclidean distance results obtained in the coinertia analysis (COIA). We cut the cluster dendrogram at height 13, yielding five groups of species. Species within each group are listed with decreasing frequency calculated as the percentage of sites with the species present relative to the total number of sites important and widespread carbon acquisition strategy among aquatic plants. This ability is, however, confined to submerged species that rely on inorganic carbon uptake from the water (Maberly & Madsen 2002) . We also observed that the abundance of species reproducing by seeds was higher in small streams, which again likely reflects lower depths that enable flowering and seed dispersal above water, making small streams more favourable as habitats for species possessing these traits. On the other hand, the observation that the plant communities in medium-sized streams were dominated by species forming dense, continuous surface canopies can be seen as an adaptation to maximize light capture in the deeper medium-sized streams. Generally, by concentrating the photo-synthetic tissues in the upper waters, plants may be able to grow in low light environments although the maximum depth for growth will depend on water turbidity as well as species-specific light requirements (Westlake 1975) . In contrast to our expectations, we did not identify differences in the abundance of species being emergent and submerged between the two stream types, suggesting that these traits are inappropriate indicators of stream size. This may reflect the high plasticity exhibited by numerous aquatic plants that are able to grow both below and above water, that is amphibious species (Hutchinson 1975; Riis, Sand-Jensen & Larsen 2001) , which complicates the use of simple classifications into emergent and submerged species.

The observed changes in community trait characteristics likely represent different strategies to increase the efficiency in light interception or utilization under nutrient enrichment. Species able to concentrate their photosynthetic active biomass in the uppermost waters either by growing from apical meristems or by producing floating leaves improve their light interception, whereas species with low light requirements are able to more efficiently utilize light for growth, thereby tolerating reduced light availability. Both strategies can be seen as a way to strengthen competitive interactions when light becomes limiting for growth. Our findings strongly support the conceptual model proposed by Hilton et al. (2006) that eutrophication promotes species that efficiently capture or utilize light, reflecting that the driver of change in community structure is light limitation. Besides intensified competition for light among plants due to enhanced aquatic plant growth, this can relate to enhanced periphytic algal growth on the leaves of the plants under nutrient-enriched conditions (Sand-Jensen 1990), which may reduce the amount of light reaching the leaves.

Results obtained from ordinary linear regression analysis between the percentage of agricultural intensity in the catchment [as a measure of eutrophication and community-weighted means for a range of traits characterizing the ecological preference, life-form, morphology, dispersal and survival characteristics of the plant community in small (R-C1) and medium-sized (R-C4) streams (see Table 2 )].

See Table 2 found that traits associated with the ability to circumvent reduced light availability either by concentrating the photosynthetic active biomass in the upper waters, where the availability of light is plenty, or by being physiologically efficient in light utilization, seem to be key traits under nutrient-enriched conditions. Although many streams and rivers currently exhibit high nutrient concentrations, a prevailing view for many years was that many rivers are insensitive to nutrient inputs (e.g. Hynes 1969 ). Here, we find evidence that lowland streams are indeed sensitive to nutrients, but that the mechanisms behind compositional changes in the plant community are related to light availability and not nutrient availability. Nutrient enrichment is accompanied by increases in the biomass of suspended particles and/or benthic primary producers in streams and rivers (e.g. Correll 1998; Smith, Tilman & Nekola 1999) , and this increase eventually affects the light climate in the streams and selects for plant species that compete successfully under reduced light availability (apical growth; floating leaves; low EL). Based on the findings obtained here, we recommend that existing WFD-compliant assessment systems are critically reappraised. We suggest moving from existing approaches building on species-specific preference values for nutrients to determine the level of nutrient impairment (see references in Demars et al. 2012) to approaches that reveal the underlying mechanisms causing compositional changes. We found clear indications that community trait characteristics were affected by eutrophication (i.e. meristem characteristics and light preference/ tolerance), indicating that community-weighted means of trait values for plants can be a useful approach to detect eutrophication-related impacts in lowland streams.

Our findings support the merit of trait-based approaches in biomonitoring (e.g. Friberg 2014) as they provide a means to obtain insight into mechanisms behind structural changes in community structure under environmental change.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "C O N C L U S I O N S"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF0": {"ref_id": "b0", "title": "Macrophyte functional variables versus species assemblages as predictors of trophic status in flowing waters", "authors": [{"first": "M", "middle": ["M"], "last": "Ali", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "K", "middle": ["J"], "last": "Murphy", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "V", "middle": ["J"], "last": "Abernethy", "suffix": ""}], "year": 1999, "venue": "Hydrobiologia", "volume": "415", "issn": "", "pages": "131--138", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF1": {"ref_id": "b1", "title": "Landscapes and riverscapes: the influence of land use on stream ecosystems", "authors": [{"first": "J", "middle": ["D"], "last": "Allan", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2004, "venue": "Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution and Systematics", "volume": "35", "issn": "", "pages": "257--284", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF2": {"ref_id": "b2", "title": "Land and water forms: physiological aspects", "authors": [{"first": "A", "middle": [], "last": "Allsopp", "suffix": ""}], "year": 1965, "venue": "Handbuch Pflanzenphysiologie", "volume": "15", "issn": "", "pages": "1236--1255", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF3": {"ref_id": "b3", "title": "Plant diversity and composition in relation to substratum characteristics in regulated and unregulated Danish streams", "authors": [{"first": "A", "middle": [], "last": "Baattrup-Pedersen", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "T", "middle": [], "last": "Riis", "suffix": ""}], "year": 1999, "venue": "Freshwater Biology", "volume": "42", "issn": "", "pages": "1--11", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF4": {"ref_id": "b4", "title": "Water quality trends in New Zealand rivers", "authors": [{"first": "D", "middle": ["J"], "last": "Ballantine", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "R", "middle": ["J"], "last": "Davies-Colley", "suffix": ""}], "year": 1989, "venue": "Environmental Monitoring and Assessment", "volume": "186", "issn": "", "pages": "1939--1950", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF5": {"ref_id": "b5", "title": "Strategies of reproduction, dispersion and competition in river plants: a review", "authors": [{"first": "M", "middle": ["H"], "last": "Barrat-Segretain", "suffix": ""}], "year": 1996, "venue": "", "volume": "123", "issn": "", "pages": "13--37", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF6": {"ref_id": "b6", "title": "Intercalibration of assessment methods for macrophytes in lowland streams: direct comparison and analysis of common metrics", "authors": [{"first": "S", "middle": [], "last": "Birk", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "T", "middle": [], "last": "Korte", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "D", "middle": [], "last": "Hering", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2006, "venue": "Hydrobiologia", "volume": "566", "issn": "", "pages": "417--430", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF7": {"ref_id": "b7", "title": "Towards harmonization of ecological quality classification: establishing common grounds in European plant assessment for rivers", "authors": [{"first": "S", "middle": [], "last": "Birk", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "N", "middle": [], "last": "Wilby", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2010, "venue": "Hydrobiologia", "volume": "652", "issn": "", "pages": "149--263", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF8": {"ref_id": "b8", "title": "Report on the Central Baltic River GIG Macrophyte Intercalibration Exercise", "authors": [{"first": "S", "middle": [], "last": "Birk", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "N", "middle": [], "last": "Willby", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "C", "middle": [], "last": "Chauvin", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "H", "middle": ["C"], "last": "Coops", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "L", "middle": [], "last": "Denys", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "D", "middle": [], "last": "Galoux", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2007, "venue": "", "volume": "82", "issn": "", "pages": "", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF9": {"ref_id": "b9", "title": "Theoretical habitat templets, species traits, and species richness: aquatic macrophytes in the upper Rhone River and its floodplain", "authors": [{"first": "G", "middle": [], "last": "Bornette", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "C", "middle": [], "last": "Henry", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "M.-H", "middle": [], "last": "Barrat", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "C", "middle": [], "last": "Amoros", "suffix": ""}], "year": 1994, "venue": "Freshwater Biology", "volume": "31", "issn": "", "pages": "487--505", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF10": {"ref_id": "b10", "title": "Studies on the ecology of rivers: I.
