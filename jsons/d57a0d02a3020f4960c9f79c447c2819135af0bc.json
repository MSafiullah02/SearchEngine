Coronaviruses are subdivided into three groups, human corona viruses 229E (hCoV-229E) and human coronavirus OC43 (hCoV-OC43) have been recognized as causes of upper respiratory tract disease including common cold and also are group 1 and 2 coronaviruses, respectively [7] . Recently, another group (hCoV, hCoV-NL63) has been reported in the Netherlands [6] . Based on the structure and function of the polymerase gene, there is a valid region for phylogenetic comparisons as well as for developing a consensus polymerase chain reaction assay applicable to fi nd the differentiation of novel coronaviruses such as SARS [8, 9] . This might prove very useful as these novel coronaviruses have been tentatively identifi ed by electron microscopy in association with a variety of human and animal diseases, although further characterization and definite identifi cation of these agents as coronaviruses has been extremely diffi cult and insensitive.

Thus, hCoVs are very diffi cult to detect and the prevalence and epidemiological data are scanty, especially in Asian countries. One recent report from Hong Kong showed that hCoV infections were also found in 4.4% (hCoV-NL63 1.5%, hCoV-OC43 0.3%, hCoV-229E 2.6%) of the children studied [14] . For isolation of suspected cases, contact tracing is only available for controlling the infection. A rapid and accurate diagnosis test is very important. Since the antibody response takes (such as SARS coronavirus) [14] 10-28 days after onset [19] , detection of viral RNA by RT-PCR is likely to be the best option for early detection [6] . In this study we applied molecular biology techniques to identify hCoV in nasopharyngeal secretions (NPs) for the study on the prevalence of molecular characterization and clinical correlation of coronavirus infections in hospitalized infants and young children with acute lower respiratory tract infection (ALRI).",
