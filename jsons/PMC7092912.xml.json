The natural substrate peptide S12 was designed based on the N-terminal self-cleavage site of SARS 3C-like proteinase, with the sequence of: Ser-Ala-Val-Leu-Gln-Ser-Gly-Phe-CONH2. Other substrates were designed by truncating the N- and C-terminals, or mutation of S12. All the designed substrate peptides were synthesized by solid-phase peptide synthesis using standard 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl/tert-butyl strategy. Cleavage of the peptide from Rink resin and removal of all sidechain-protecting groups were achieved in trifluoroacetic acid solution. The crude peptide was purified by reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC, Elite P200II, Dalian, China) on a Zorbax C18 semi-preparative column (9.4 by 250 mm, Agilent) with gradients of water/acetonitrile containing 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. Peptide homogeneity and identity were analyzed by analytical RP-HPLC, and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectroscopy, respectively.",

Mutations to small residues such as Ala also decrease the relative reaction activity of the substrate significantly. Although Phe, Val, and Met are tolerant at P2 for SARS 3C-like proteinase [10], the mutation of Leu-P2 to other hydrophobic residues decreases the substrate reaction activity by a factor of 5\u2013200 (see Table 1).
