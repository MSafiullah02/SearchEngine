Deficiencies in normal host defense mechanisms influence the epidemiology, risk factors, and outcomes for CAP [5]. The etiology of CAP can be defined broadly into typical pathogens (eg, S pneumoniae, H influenza, and Moraxella catarrhalis), atypical pathogens (eg, Legionella spp, M pneumoniae, C pneumoniae), viruses, aspiration, and other agents. The etiologic agents and risk factors of common CAP pathogens for immunocompetent hosts are summarized in Table 1\n. In immunocompromised hosts, in addition to the usual pathogens, the etiology of CAP also includes opportunistic infections, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PCP), and other opportunistic fungal infections (Table 2\n). Coexisting pulmonary pathogens should be considered when clinical isolates have been detected, when patients lack clinical improvement, and when patients have clinical deterioration despite seemingly appropriate treatment.",

In the United States, nonsusceptibility to penicillin has increased significantly during the past decade [13]. Frequently, rates of penicillin-resistant S pneumoniae (PRSP) are in excess of 30% [14]. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for most strains with high-level resistance are 2 to 4 \u03bcg/mL. Of concern, the increasing rate of penicillin resistance is associated with resistance to beta-lactams and other classes of antibiotics, such as macrolides, tetracycline, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole [14]. With the increase in the rate of PRSP, physicians should be aware of the changing epidemiology and microbiology of pneumococcal disease to provide appropriate empiric antimicrobial treatment.",

Although M catarrhalis pneumonia causes a significant illness in elderly patients, fulminant pneumonia, pleural effusion, and empyema are uncommon [18]. Most (90%) strains of M catarrhalis produce an inducible \u03b2-lactamase [21].

Low CD4 cell counts, injection drug use, prior sinusitis, and prior lower respiratory tract bacterial infection are risk factors for bacterial pneumonia in patients with HIV infection [38], [39], whereas trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole prophylaxis is associated with a lower risk of bacterial pneumonia [38], [40], [41]. Several studies have confirmed bacterial pneumonia to be the most common pulmonary complication in patients with HIV/AIDS. S pneumoniae, S aureus, H influenzae, and M pneumoniae are the most frequent pathogens identified [5], [38], [42], [43].

It is estimated that 6000 to 9000 new cases of tuberculosis occur annually in the United States in patients with HIV/AIDS [45], [47]. HIV-infected patients have markedly increased risks for primary infection, reactivation of tuberculosis, and second episodes of tuberculosis from exogenous reinfection [47]. Most cases present as pulmonary infections, with case rates extraordinarily high among indigent patients and users of illicit drugs [47]. Clinical studies have shown the detrimental effects of tuberculosis on the course of HIV infection, with a twofold higher mortality in dual-infected hosts when compared with HIV-infected patients without tuberculosis, independent of CD4 cell count [47].

            "text": "With the advent of combination ART, the incidence of opportunistic infections in hosts with HIV infection has substantially declined [50]. Likewise, the incidence of opportunistic fungal infections is approximately 20% to 25% of the incidence seen in the mid-1990s. Despite the decline in the incidence of opportunistic infections, fungal infections are still common in patients with advanced HIV disease. Such infections occur in patients who are long-term nonpresenters, who are nonadherent to ART, or who do not seek medical care [50], [51]. P jiroveci pneumonia (PCP) remains the most common opportunistic infection, whereas the incidence of pneumonia owing to Cryptococcus neoformans, Histoplasma capsulatum, Coccidioides immitis, and Penicillium marneffei varies greatly depending on the geographic location (see Table 2) [50], [51]. As is true for tuberculous and nontuberculous mycobacterial infections, some cases of fungal pneumonias have been associated with the use of ART and the subsequent immune restoration from AIDS [51]. Because this syndrome may mask the clinical presentation of typical and atypical pneumonic infections, a high index of suspicion is necessary for early diagnosis.",

Pneumonic presentations of bioterrorist activity are likely attributed to Bacillus anthracis, Yersinia pestis, or Francisella tularensis. Any suspected case should be treated as an epidemiologic emergency. The local health department should be notified. Because these agents may be transmittable from person to person, a high index of suspicion will lead to prompt diagnosis and proper treatment. Initial assessment of all patients with CAP should include a travel history, animal exposures, and occupational risk (see Table 3).",
