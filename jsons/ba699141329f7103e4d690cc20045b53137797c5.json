Briq. which is located in the occidental Algeria areas. This study reveals that Isothymol, a major component of this plant, gives the best docking scores, compared to, the co-crystallized inhibitor b-D-mannose of the enzyme ACE2, to Captropil drug as good ACE2 inhibitor and to Chloroquine antiviral drug also involved in other mechanisms as inhibition of ACE2 cellular receptor. In silico (ADME), drug-likeness, PASS & P450 site of metabolism prediction, pharmacophore Mapper showed that the compound Isothymol has given a good tests results compared to the b-Dmannose co-crystallized inhibitor, to Captopril and Chloroquine drugs. Also the other natural compounds gave good results. The Molecular Dynamics Simulation study showed good result for the Isotymol-ACE2 docked complex. This study revealed for the first time that Isothymol is a functional inhibitor of angiotensin converting enzyme 2 activity and the components of essential oils Ammoides verticillata can be used as potential inhibitors to the ACE2 receptor of SARS-CoV-2.",

This virus is from the family Coronaviridae and was detected in the city of Wuhan in China Elmezayen et al., 2020) . It was originally named 2019-nCoV. It is now called SARS-CoV-2 (Pant et al., 2020) . The disease associated with this virus is COVID-19. The onset of the COVID-19 atypical pneumonia outbreak was reported on December 31, 2019 (Sarma et al., 2020; Gupta et al., 2020) . Common symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath . Other symptoms may include fatigue, muscle pain, diarrhea, sore throat, loss of smell, and abdominal pain (Hopkins, 2020) . The time from exposure to onset of symptoms is typically around five days but may range from two to fourteen days (Velavan & Meyer, 2020) . While the majority of cases result in mild symptoms, some progress to viral pneumonia and multi-organ failure (Hui et al., 2020; Muralidharan et al., 2020) . As of 16 April 2020, more than 2.13 million cases have been reported across 210 countries and territories, resulting in more than 142,000 deaths. More than 540,000 people have recovered.",

Some, in particular those of subgroup A of the genus Betacoronavirus, have a characteristic HE protein (hemagglutinin esterase). The SARS coronavirus also presents on protein S a specific binding site for the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) which serves as an entry point into the host cell (Fang, 2005) . Research suggests that the receptor is another potential target for vaccines or therapies. An inhibitor that blocks the receptor could make it more difficult for coronavirus to enter cells, which could at least significantly slow the epidemic until the virus disappears (Boopathy et al., 2020; Hasan et al., 2020) .",

In addition, the essential oil can trap 50% of the free DPPH radical at a concentration of 15.37 lg/ml (Sandberg & Corrigon, 2001; Higley & Higley, 2005; Pole, 2013) . Also other study show that aerial parts (leaves and flowers) of Ammoides verticillata (Desf.) Briq. collected in occidental Algeria areas, exhibited a very unusual composition. Isothymol was by far the major component (51.2%), accompanied by p-cymene (14.1%), thymol (13.0%), limonene (11.9%) and cterpinene (6.8%) 11 (Kambouche & El-Abed, 2003) . According to (Lawrence, 2006) , it is worth noting that this oil is the richest source of naturally occurring isothymol (Bekhechia et al., 2010) . The aims of this study consist to establish a structure-activity relationship of actives principles of Ammoides verticillata compounds: Isothymol, Thymol, Limonene, P-Cymene and c-Terpinene against ACE 2 activity compared to b-D-Mannose, co-cristallized inhibitor of this enzyme, this molecule is used in the RCSB data bank to block the ACE2 enzyme activity, and we compared also our results with 2 drugs which are used as good inhibitors to ACE2, the Captopril hypertension drug and Chloroquine antimalarials and amebicides drug which has also previously shown activity on coronavirus replication (Guastalegname & Vallone, 2020) . In this work we will take it as a witness for the discussion of our results to lead to other inhibitors which can also block the ACE2 enzyme activity and used as potential treatment of COVID-19. For this purpose, a molecular docking study was applied for testing the type of interactions between active site residues and the principles actives compounds from Ammoides vericillata with ACE2, and calculation of the binding free energies (S-score, kcal/mol) and bonds in order to predict the binding model of the selected compound to the three-dimensional structure of the enzyme (Aanouz et al., 2020).",

This test is done to check whether the drug will be easily absorbed in the intestine or not. However Isothymol, Thymol, Limonene, P-Cymene, c-Terpinene, Chloroquine and Captopril show a positive HIA test so they will be well absorbed by the human intestine. The inhibition of the Pgp glycoprotein facilitates the transport of many drugs inside the cell, according to our results Isothymol is the only pgp inhibitor so it will be easily absorbed by the cells. Furthermore in the distribution part, the binding of drugs to plasma proteins is also an important pharmacological parameter; in our study the Captopril drug give a low capacity and negative test but Chloroquine drug and Isothymol show a good capacity and positive test for binding to plasma proteins so they are able to cross the blood-brain barrier. Also in the metabolism part, the cytochrome P450 is an enzyme family which metabolizes the drugs, so in our test only Isothymol is the inhibitor of CYP 450 A2, CYP4502C9, CYP4502C19, and also the substrate of CYP450A2, CYP4593A4, CYP4502C19, CYP4502D6, so the Isothymol can be metabolized by these enzymes . In the excretion part, the half-life of a drug describes the time required for the amount of a drug to be reduced in the body by half or 50% (Swierczewska et al., 2015; Smalling, 1996; Sahin & Benet, 2008) . The series of ligands studied have a half-life between 1.129 h and 2.23 h of which the Isothymol ligand of the plant Ammoides verticillata has a significant half-life. That is to say, they give a potential effectiveness. Regarding the toxicity part, HERG is a K \u00fe channel found in the heart muscle and ensures the correct rhythm of the heart, if HERG is blocked by certain drugs, it can cause cardiac arrhythmia and death (Sanguinetti et al., 1995; Aronov, 2005) , the Chloroquine drug which is used for the treatment of COVID-19 is blocker to HERG so it can cause cardiac arrhythmia and death but the Isothymol is not HERG blocker which gives good result as drug. For the H-HT, AMES, Chloroquine drug gives the positive test but Isothymol present negative tests in the toxicity part, and all the molecules derived from the Ammoides verticillata present negative tests. In this ADMET part it can be suggested that the Isothymol molecule has better drug properties than the Chloroquine drug.",

Finally we can suggest from this in silico study that Ammoides verticillata (Desf.) Briq. essential oils components can blocks the receptor ACE2 and could make it more difficult for coronavirus to enter cells, which could at least significantly slow the epidemic until the virus disappears. Though these properties are appreciable in silico, further studies of in vitro and clinical studies dealing with SARS-CoV-2 should be considered for further studies.",
