The last three decades have seen a considerable upsurge in the use of mathematical and computational models to explore the dynamics and control of a wide range of viral infections. This phase arose initially from developments in ecological population dynamics [ 4 ] ; it was then greatly accelerated, both by the explosion in computational power and by the emergence of human immunodefi ciency virus (HIV) infection, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and other potential pandemic threats [ 5 ] .",

We illustrate these patterns with the best documented case -the dynamics of measles in large cities in England and Wales [ 2 , 3 ] . Figure 5 .1a shows the time series of raw weekly notifi cations for measles in London from 1944 (shortly after measles cases became notifi able) to 1994. These data indicate three fairly distinctive dynamical eras: \u2022 1944-1950: Principally annual epidemics. \u2022 1950s-1960s: Regular, mainly biennial epidemic cycles, with intervening small annual peaks -incidence rates are markedly seasonal (Sect. 2.4 ). \u2022 1970s onwards: The vaccine era brought declining incidence, with increasing irregular, lower-amplitude epidemic cycles. By the end of the series shown in this fi gure, cases became very sporadic, with increasing levels of mis-notifi cation of clinically identifi ed cases [ 7 ] . As well as these fl uctuations in individual large cities, there are also rich dynamical patterns in the spatial spread of epidemics among large and small communities (Sect. 4 ). Regional and temporal demographic variations, especially in birth rate , can also markedly infl uence dynamics (Sect. 2.4 ).",

            "text": "The striking epidemic patterns of acute immunizing infections are particularly well documented for widely notifi able infections such as measles. The process of explaining these cycles, as well as that of addressing associated public health issues, has spawned an extensive analytical literature, spanning public health epidemiology, theoretical biology, and population dynamics [ 4 , 5 , 8 -10 ] . The key conceptual tool has been a family of compartmental dynamical models, based on the SIR (susceptible-infected-recovered) paradigm [ 2 -5 , 11 , 12 ] . As described below, the SIR family successfully captures many key features of the epidemiological dynamics and control of viral infections. The basic SIR formulation embodies the dynamics of immunizing infections. Because viruses reproduce rapidly in the host, we ignore within-host kinetics in the simplest SIR models (but see Sect. 8 ); depending on model details, this leads to a compartmentalization of the host population between (as yet uninfected) susceptible individuals, infected, recovered, and other classes. An initial taxonomic split here is between the SIR model (which crudely assumes that all infected individuals can pass on infection) and the SEIR (susceptible, exposed, infected, recovered) model, which adds an \"exposed\" (infected but not yet infectious) class [ 4 ] . SIR and SEIR models have qualitatively very similar dynamics [ 13 ] ; however, we describe the latter with its more realistic depiction of viral incubation. The basic SEIR model, illustrated in Fig. 5 .1b , refl ects the following set of biological assumptions; we use measles as the classic acute exemplar here [ 14 ] . After a few months of maternally derived passive immunity, infants enter the virus-na\u00efve \"susceptible\" (S) class; susceptibles can then become infected by close contact with infectious individuals (generally via respiratory aerosol for measles). Infection moves individuals into the \"exposed\" (E) class, where they incubate but do not transmit the infection for around a week; this leads to the infectious (I) class, where virus is shed, again for approximately a week, after which individuals enter the recovered state (R). In the basic SEIR model, recovered individuals are assumed to be immune for life, both to clinical disease and to retransmitting the infection. However, subclinical infection (and hence boosting of immunity [ 15 , 16 ] ) is in principle possible. The lifelong sterilizing immunity induced by such an infection also makes this an excellent potential vaccine candidate [ 4 ] . For the SEIR model, vaccination is at its simplest assumed to be delivered to a proportion p of infants at the end of the maternal immunity period (i.e., near the effective \"birth\" of susceptibles). For individuals who seroconvert, immunity is then often assumed to be lifelong, moving susceptibles into the recovered class ( Fig. 5.1c ) . There is also a considerable literature exploring more operationally realistic age distributions and immunogenic characteristics of vaccines in specifi c cases [ 5 , 17 ] .",

            "text": "We can lay bare much of the dynamical behavior of immunizing epidemics by considering the case of the \"simple\" epidemic ( Fig. 5 .1c , d ), in which the outbreak occurs suffi ciently rapidly to ignore processes of host birth and death. The talismanic quantity here is the basic reproduction number (or ratio) of infection, R 0 [ 4 , 5 ] . At its simplest, R 0 is defi ned as the total number of secondary cases caused by an infectious individual when introduced into a well-mixed fully susceptible population. To illustrate the ensuing dynamics, consider an epidemic of infection with R 0 > 0. Since each case initially causes R 0 secondary infections, the epidemic increases more or less exponentially over the fi rst few infectious generations ( Fig. 5.1c ). However, these dynamics rapidly deplete the susceptible pool. This brings us to the other key parameter of epidemic spread: the effective reproduction number, defi ned as R = [ S / N ] R 0 . Here, S / N is the proportion of susceptibles in the population and R is the realized value of R 0 as the epidemic develops [ 4 ] . Since S declines over the course of the epidemic (Fig. 5.1c ), so does R (Fig. 5.1d ). This progressive decline in secondary infection rates through the epidemic is a manifestation of the key epidemiological process of herd immunity [ 18 ] -increasing natural immunity of the population that indirectly protects the remaining susceptibles from infection. Eventually, the effective reproduction ratio declines through unity (Fig. 5 .1c ) as population immunity increases; this corresponds to the herd immunity threshold, above which the epidemic will always decline, even if reintroduced to a closed population. This threshold is thus also a key aim of vaccination campaigns [ 4 , 5 ] . Remembering that R = [ S / N ] R 0 , the associated susceptible proportion at the herd immunity threshold ( R = 1) becomes s c = 1/ R 0 ( Fig. 5 .1c ); thus, immunizing at a level above p c = 1 \u2212 s c = 1 \u2212 1/ R 0 will eliminate local transmission. As described below, these calculations have been refi ned considerably to allow for heterogeneities in transmission with age, space, and other characteristics (Sects. 3 , 4 , and 5 ). Nonetheless, our simple expression for p c is an extremely useful metaphor for epidemic control: (1) because of indirect protection, not everyone needs to be vaccinated to eliminate transmission (corresponding to p c < 1) and (2) the effort required to increase this level of immunization increases with transmission rates. The latter point is made clear by a simple plot of p c against R 0 ( Fig. 5 .2 ); more transmissible immunizing infections such as measles are harder to control than less transmissible agents such as smallpox. However, this refers to \"random\" mass vaccination; more targeted strategies such as ring vaccination coupled to active surveillance can promote elimination even below p c , given (as with smallpox elimination [ 19 ] ) the right biological characteristics and logistics. Partial immunity and other characteristics of the population can complicate the picture still further (see Sect. 5.2 below). Nonetheless, the metaphor that more transmissibility necessitates a stronger vaccination effort remains.",

For measles in England and Wales, seasonal variation in transmission driven by increased contact rates of children when schools were in session rapidly emerged as a possible candidate [ 12 , 21 ] and has since received considerable empirical support [ 2 , 3 ] . Stochastic fl uctuations in incidence could in principle also contribute to the maintenance of cycles [ 22 , 23 ] ; however, for measles, the predominant driver is seasonality in transmission [ 2 , 3 ] . Birth rate may modulate the periodicity of recurrent cycles driven by seasonality through its role in determining the rate of susceptible replenishment [ 24 ] . For example, for most of the postwar pre-vaccination era in London, seasonality generated sustained cycles by resonating with the biennial epidemic tendency of measles dynamics. However, during the postwar baby boom, births achieved suffi cient levels to shift measles dynamics into annual cycles ( Fig. 5.4 ).",

Until recently, it was thought that chaotic measles dynamics were not likely to [ 20 ] ). The green trajectory shows the joint dynamics of susceptible and infectious densities through time; area plots show the dynamics of infectious and susceptible individuals (Taken from Fig. 3 in above book chapter, found on p. 39) be observed [ 3 , 25 ] , since observed seasonality in transmission was not strong enough to drive the associated violent epidemics. However, recent analyses of measles in Niger revealed very strong seasonality (driven by movement in and out of cities linked to rainfall); this, combined with high transmission rates and the highest birth rate in the world, results in irregular outbreaks consistent with expectations of chaos ( Fig. 5 .5 ). Erratic boom and bust outbreaks are expected to continue even as routine vaccination improves; and this suggests that high investment in reactive vaccination and surveillance is important, and pulsed vaccination approaches such as supplementary immunization activities could also play a helpful role in synchronizing dynamics [ 26 ] .

            "text": "The mean age at which individuals become infected by immunizing viral infection is generally lower for infections with higher rates of transmission or R 0 (defi ned above). Intuitively, this occurs because the faster an immunizing virus is spreading through a population, the younger the age at which individuals are likely to be exposed to it. Host demography modulates this relationship, and higher birth rate countries with an R 0 equivalent to that in lower birth rate countries will tend to have a lower average age of infection [ 27 ] . Maternal immunity, or protection of children after birth by transfer of maternal antibodies, will also have an impact, increasing the average age of infection for children whose mothers have been exposed to infection. Since maternal antibodies rarely persist for much more than a year, this effect will be greatest for infections with very low average ages of infection [ 4 ] . Beyond these broad descriptors, however, there is the added complication of possible relationships between age and probability of exposure to infection. Such relationships may arise for a variety of reasons. For example, only individuals beyond a certain age may work in areas where the disease is transmitted, or the disease may be only sexually transmitted. As a result, the force of infection, or probability that a susceptible individual will be infected, will show a distinct relationship with age. For directly transmitted infections, like measles, mumps, rubella, and infl uenza, the age profi le of the force of infection is determined by the rate at which individuals of different ages interact. There are two approaches to estimating this variation. The fi rst is to use age profi les of seropositivity to infer the pattern of the force of infection and, from this, extrapolate to the pattern of contacts over age [ 28 -31 ] . The link between these age profi les and the force of infection over age can be made since once an individual has been infected, she/he can never be infected again. Therefore, to be immune at any age, the individual must have contracted the infection prior to that age. On a population level, crosssectional seropositivity thus provides an indication of the total risk of infection for individuals up to a given age.",

            "text": "So far, we have assumed that deterministic, spatially homogeneous dynamics govern infectious disease outbreaks. In fact, epidemics often spread across a heterogeneous landscape of human cities, towns, or rural communities, and this spread depends partly on the links between those locations. This leads us to move from the deterministic SIR model described above to stochastic models, which account for the random nature of individual infection dynamics and demography -for instance, individuals may or may not become infected with a given average probability, so that by chance, particularly in small populations, no new infections may occur, and the chain of transmission may be broken. During the troughs between epidemic outbreaks in smaller communities, incidence may fall to such low numbers that local extinction is likely. Based on this observation, Bartlett [ 9 , 40 ] used analyses of epidemiological data and stochastic models to develop the notion of critical community size (CCS), or population size below which stochastic extinction is expected, which was further developed by Black [ 41 ] in studies of measles persistence in insular populations. Bartlett demonstrated the existence of a CCS of around 300,000-500,000 for measles in England and Wales. For measles to persist in locations with a population size smaller than this CCS, immigration of infected immigrants from elsewhere in the metapopulation is necessary. The result is that the spread of measles across England and Wales in the pre-vaccine era resembled traveling waves spreading out from London [ 6 ] , with a substantial epidemic lag in locations further away. The duration of the lag was also shaped by the size of the local populations. The duration of fade-outs following local extinction contains information on the degree to which a particular location is connected to the metapopulation as a whole [ 42 ] . Generally, this points to larger places being more connected. More detailed parametric analyses tend to confi rm this (e.g., the gravity model [ 43 ] ).",

Figure 5 .7 explores this comparison, simulating an infection which invades a partly susceptible population (full details are given in Ref.

Figure 5 .7 indicates, fi rst, that increasing the infectious period reduces, and eventually eliminates, the tendency for cyclical epidemics [ 48 ] ; essentially, a longer infectious period \"fi lls in the troughs\" following major epidemics. As infectious period increases, we therefore see a transition from seasonally driven biennial epidemics (at the measles extreme of a 1-week infectious period) to lowamplitude annual epidemics (at 1 month). For longer infectious periods (1 year), we see slowly evolving epidemics with little seasonal activity and a modest post-epidemic overshoot. Finally, for a 10-year infectious period, we see a smooth slow epidemic, with an essentially \"logistic\" rise to a stable endemic plateau of incidence. Though crude, this exercise captures the essential dynamical transmission from the violent epidemics of acute infections to the much smoother and slower epidemic invasion of HIV [ 4 ] . Note that the seasonal variation in infection rate is assumed similar for the \"measles\" and \"HIV\" cases; however, the latter completely eliminates associated seasonal fl uctuations in incidence due to the smoothing effect of prolonged infectious carriage. Figure 5 .7 also illustrates a second major dynamical impact arising from the trade-off of increased infectious period against lowered infection rate. \"Fast\" infections are much more prey to local stochastic extinction in the deep troughs between epidemics (Sect. 2.4 ) than the much more endemic incidence promoted by longer infectious period. On the other hand, acute immunizing infections can invade populations much more quickly than chronic infections for the same R 0 (Note that very imperfect immunity (corresponding to 'SIS' dynamics) could generate 'fast' invasion even for relatively chronic infections ( Figure 5.7 , inset) , because of the increased supply of susceptible individuals (Sect. 5.2 )). Note that, despite these great variations in dynamics, the assumption of a common R 0 means that the herd immunity threshold for elimination of infection is the same across this range of behaviors Sect. ( 2.3 ).",

In either case, the overall dynamical effect is for recovered, immune individuals to eventually reenter the susceptible pool, as illustrated by Fig. 5.8a . Where such waning of immunity is appreciable, the implications for vaccination can be profound. As the susceptible pool is replenished not only by births but also by previ-ously immune individuals, the critical vaccination threshold (Sect. 2.3 ) is raised, making it more diffi cult to control the spread of infection.

An example is hepatitis B, in which 5-10 % of adult patients show chronic infection. As illustrated in Fig. 5 .8c , this can be represented mathematically by identifying two infectious classes: one acute and the other chronic. Such factors can have implications for the dynamics and persistence of infections in a population [ 55 ] . In particular, where a disease shows epidemic cycles, facing the possibility of local extinction in the epidemic troughs, the presence of a small number of carrier hosts can facilitate viral persistence in the population, through these troughs. For example, in some cases infection with varicella zoster virus can be followed decades later by infectious shingles, an occurrence which could maintain the virus in small populations [ 56 ] .",

Indeed, raising such immunity is a central function of current infl uenza vaccines. However, HA is also the most variable viral component, continually under selective pressure to escape antibody binding [ 51 ] . For these reasons, while infl uenza evolution is by no means limited to HA, this viral component has attracted the most attention. An important mechanism of immune escape is through conformational changes of HA epitopes to abrogate antibody binding, without compromising the ability of the virus to attach to host cells [ 75 ] . More recently, however, results from mouse experiments suggest that escape mutants can also acquire increased viral avidity for host cells [ 76 ] . Another potential immune escape strategy [ 77 ] is glycosylation, or the attachment of oligosaccharides to the HA molecule, to occlude epitopes from antibody binding. Such strategies are not without potential functional costs for replication [ 78 ] , and yet there are indications that human infl uenza A/H3N2 has been accumulating glycosylation since its introduction into the human population in 1968 [ 79 , 80 ] .",

Ultimately, a single strain accumulates the substitutions required to transition to a new antigenic phenotype. At this point, the emergent strain -owing to its antigenic novelty -causes a peak in infection and undergoes a selective sweep in the host population, to the exclusion of other strains.

Both within and between virus species, some variants may barely affect hosts at all, while others have signifi cant health impacts, up to and including host mortality [ 86 ] . An evolutionary perspective indicates that variation in virulence across clones should be shaped by the costs and benefi ts of virulence for parasite transmission [ 87 ] . The spread and persistence of virulence mutations may be favored if they covary with transmission. However, since host mortality can interrupt transmission, a range of values of virulence may lead to equivalent levels of overall fi tness for the parasite [ 88 ] . While it is broadly agreed that the theoretical framework and empirical evidence on the existence of virulence-transmission trade-offs need to be further developed and extended [ 87 ] , there are some systems where the general predictions appear to be borne out (e.g., [ 89 , 90 ] ). Perhaps most famously, the introduction of the myxoma virus into Australia was at fi rst devastating to rabbit populations, causing near 100 % mortality. However, over subsequent years, the virulence of the infection decreased. Various lines of evidence suggest that this occurred in response to selection for increased transmission via decreased virulence -swift rabbit mortality was not an effi cient mode of transmission for the virus.",

The \"kinetics\" of viral infection arise from a complex array of factors including viral replication and variability, the dynamics of the immune response, and pathogenicity to the host [ 91 ] . Over the past two decades, mathematical models have played an important role in studying these dynamics, often motivated by the need to understand the actual and potential impact of interventions such as treatment or immunization [ 91 -93 ] . A major example is HIV infection (see Chap. 43 ); its clinical course is characterized by an initial acute phase of viral replication, lasting on the order of weeks, followed by an asymptomatic latent phase that can last decades before ultimately progressing to AIDS [ 94 ] . Major advances in the 1990s showed that despite the long clinical timescale involved, in vivo HIV replication is in fact a rapid process, with the viral life cycle being on the order of days [ 95 , 96 ] . Subsequent studies modeling the dynamics of drug resistance underlined the need for early and aggressive drug therapy [ 97 ] . Conversely, more recent work capturing the dynamics of the immune response has illustrated how immunity raised by CD8+ T-cell vaccination elicits a response that is too weak and too late to achieve sterilizing immunity [ 98 ] .",
