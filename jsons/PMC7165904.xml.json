Furthermore, the faecal prevalences of the most important viral, bacterial and parasitic enteropathogens as co\u2010infecting agents to BoTV on the one hand and on the other as causative pathogens in neonatal calf diarrhoea were determined. The health status of cattle herds and single animals in relation to a variety of parameters like clinical symptoms, farm management and presence of pathogens were evaluated statistically.",

In contrast, Duckmanton et al. (1998) reported a considerably higher faecal prevalence of 36.4% in southern Ontario. Compared with other enteropathogens, BoTV faecal prevalence is rather low. A possible explanation might be the short excretion period of only 3\u20134 days (Woode et al., 1982, 1985; Liebler et al., 1992). However, using the very sensitive RT\u2010PCR, Hoet et al. (2003a) were able to detect BoTV in faeces as early as 24 h post\u2010infection (p.i.) and up to 8\u20139 days p.i., with the most consistent range between days 2 and 6 p.i.",

Calves shedding BoTV in faeces were 6.35 times more likely to have diarrhoea than calves not shedding BoTV. These results indicate that BoTV, although not a major cause of disease, is of considerable importance in calf diarrhoea. However, it remains impossible to determine whether BoTV was the primary cause of diarrhoea in the symptomatic calves, which had concomitant infections with other enteropathogens. Even in the calves with BoTV single infections, the occurrence of other enteropathogens before the time of sampling cannot be excluded.",

Three calves were suffering from additional respiratory tract disease (RTD), ranging from bronchitis to bronchopneumonia. In all three calves co\u2010infected with BCV, a possible trigger and cause of RTD, was detected, the aetiological involvement of the two pathogens is impossible to determine. Observations by Vanopdenbosch et al. (1992) confirmed the pathogenicity of BoTV for the respiratory tract. Respiratory toroviral infections occur mainly during the first month of life and at the age of 4\u20136 months. It is possible that BoTV might play a role in RTD of young calves (Vanopdenbosch et al., 1991). As in this study, calves with RTD were not investigated for specific aetiological pathogens, BoTV might possibly have played a role as a cofactor in those diseases too. The role of BoTV in RTD has to be clarified by further studies with different sampling techniques.",

Bovine coronavirus is estimated to account for 20\u201326% of all cases of calf diarrhoea (Anonymous, 1983), and BCV involvement in calf scours can go up to 48% (Doll, 2002). Rotavirus was detected with a faecal prevalence of 9.1%, which is rather low compared with investigations from Lower Saxony (Germany), where RV was detected in 31.5% of all collected samples (Liebler et al., 1992). In particular, for RV and BCV, the respective prevalences might be higher in our calves, as intermittent virus shedding has been reported in both healthy and diseased animals (Crouch and Acres, 1984; Schwers et al., 1984; Collins et al., 1987). Cryptosporidia faecal prevalence was 11.7%. Faecal prevalences can go up to 60% (Doll, 2002), with a peak shedding in calves 1\u20133 weeks old (Huetink et al., 2001). Giardia duodenalis was detected in 3\u201345% of calves older than 2 weeks (Doll, 2002), while in our study, it could be found in 6.1% of all calves. Eimeria bovis and zuernii and other eimeriae faecal prevalences were 3.9% and 6.5% respectively. Depending on animal housing and pasture management, infestation rates can range from 12% to 100% (Rommel, 2000). Concerning E. coli subtype, faecal prevalences range from 3% to 54% (Steiner et al., 1997; Doll, 2002), which corresponds to our results (17.0%). C. perfringens (faecal prevalence in our study: 9.1%) causes a number of diseases among humans and animals; information in literature goes up to a morbidity of 50% in single outbreaks (Klee, 2002).",
