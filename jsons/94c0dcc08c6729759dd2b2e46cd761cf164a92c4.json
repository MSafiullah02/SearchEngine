The travel patterns at the end of these international events may result in epidemics that can grow to pandemic levels within a short period of time. Computational models are essential tools to estimate, study, and control disease outbreaks at mass gatherings. These models can be integrated in the planning and preparation process of mass gatherings. In this paper, we present a review of the key data requirements and the challenges encountered when modeling infectious diseases epidemics initiated by global mass gatherings. This review can assist epidemic modeling at global mass gatherings providing researchers with insights of the main aspects and possible big data opportunities in this emerging research area.",

Participants attending these events may be exposed to serious health threats. The gathering of high population density in a close proximity during MGs has the potential to facilitate the transmission of communicable diseases [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . Furthermore, the global events (such as the Olympics, the FIFA World Cup, and the Hajj; the Muslim pilgrimage to Makkah) where people gather from different countries present serious health threats and challenges for both the hosting countries and the countries of origin of the participants. These global MGs allow the mixing of various infectious pathogens due to the diverse disease exposure history and demographics of the participants. When these global events are over, the travel patterns of the participants could cause a rapid spread of infectious diseases affecting large number of people and causing global epidemic within a short period.",

Also, activities of the 2009 pandemic influenza A (H1N1) virus have been reported during several music festivals [11] . Several outbreaks have been reported in different MGs of varying sizes with the most common reported infections being respiratory viruses including different strains of influenza [12] . As shown in the Fig. 1 below, there was a global spread of N meningitidis W135 after recurrent outbreaks of W135 during the Hajj seasons of 2000 and 2001. Also, influenza outbreaks have been reported in 2002 and in 2008 at the Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, UT, USA [13] , and the World Youth Day in Sydney [14] respectively.

These models vary from the simple mathematical SIR [21] (Susceptible--Infected-Recovered) model to more complicated spatial-temporal simulations that allow the introduction of prevention and mitigation measures. However, few studies are devoted to computational models of epidemics at mass gatherings. In their study, Chowell et al.

First, the authors gathered and analyzed the previous global travel patterns, focusing on the Olympic Winter Games for the past decade. Then, based on results of that analysis, the 25 cities with the highest numbers of travellers were identified, and the infectious disease surveillance in those cities was conducted. Next, the information from the HealthMap (www.healthmap.org) was integrated to the global infectious disease surveillance. As described by Khan et al.

HealthMap provided a real time analysis before and during the 2010 Olympic Winter Games. Although, applying their model to the 2010 Olympic Winter Games did not reveal any serious threats, it provided the Canadian health officials with advanced knowledge to be prepared to any threats.",

They used a stochastic SEIR (Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered) model to demonstrate the impact of using different contact patterns on the dynamic of the infection. The authors were able to measure the interactions between the individuals within the two days of the conference using wearable sensors (RFID; radiofrequency identification devices). Then, the collected data was used to compare three different contact networks: dynamic, homogeneous, and heterogeneous. These contact networks differ in the type and the duration of the interactions between individuals. Their results of the contact duration and distribution showed a high probability of pathogen spread for a small number of infected people. This probability was smaller in homogeneous networks as compared to heterogeneous and dynamic networks.",

In the \"regular\" period, Agents are moving to and from households, schools or workplaces, and other public places. The proportion of the created population was selected to mix within a large group to model temporal mass gatherings. To validate their model, Shi et al.

The results obtained from the simulation experiments identified several factors that affect the dynamics of the influenza epidemic, including the timing of mass gatherings or travel in relation to the epidemic peak and the pathogen's infectious period. Also, the simulation indicated little impact of the changes in the social mixing on the course of an epidemic.

In fact, based on the epidemic modeling approach these demographic data if known, can be used to identify, estimate, or make reliable assumptions about other modeling attributes such as the contact patterns, the susceptibility levels, and the vaccination status. Knowing the age distribution of the population can provide insights into the contact rates and the susceptibility levels of different age groups. In fact, the correlation between the different age groups and the contact rates was investigated in several studies. In a recent study [26] , Cowling et al. revealed a strong age-based contact rate based on analyzing contact patterns in different settings in several European countries. It was concluded that compared to other age groups, children and adolescents tend to have a higher rate of contacts within their age group. Thus, children and teenagers play an important role in disease spread of close contact infections especially influenza. As a result it is important to conduct studies for age-based risk groups for different diseases in the context of MGs.",

In some MGs like Hajj, vaccination requirements for entry visa are issued based on the country of origin. For example, arrivals from polio-endemic countries are required to provide a proof of Poliomyelitis vaccination 6 weeks prior attending Hajj [28] . The vaccination coverage of different age groups can be acquired from different sources based on the country of origin such as official public health websites. The National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS) (www.cdc.gov/ nchs/) provides detailed health measures and statistics including age-based vaccination coverage of different diseases. Also, there are several published reports and surveys provide information about the immunizations status in several countries either for specific age groups or the whole population. For example, the publicly available information provided in several reports [29, 30] of the seasonal influenza vaccination in Europe can be used to estimate the levels of immunity and susceptibility when modeling a MGs occurring in Europe.",

Thus, identifying and analyzing the incoming travel patterns can help hosting countries to estimate the risks of importing infectious diseases.

For example, in their study Khan et al.

Their study confirmed H1N1 introductions within a few weeks in 20 countries where the highest number of arriving passengers from Mexico. Also, as stated previously after the Hajj season on 2009 several studies [7] [8] [9] [10] were conducted to trace H1N1 pandemics among the returning pilgrims arriving from Saudi Arabia.

The variety of data to be captured from several sources is extensive, and includes demographics, airline traffic data, climate data, spatial data, and social and mobile phone network. Moreover, gathering detailed data about the expected participating populations at MGs prior to the event is very challenging if not infeasible. But, it is essential to have at least an adequate approximation of the demographics of the expected populations. For example, data from previous occurrences of MGs can be collected and analyzed to estimate the features of future participants attending similar events. In addition, as suggested by Nsoesie et al. [20] and Chowell et al. [22] using advanced monitoring and sensing devices of a representative sample provides higher levels of details about participants at MGs and their interactions and movements. With such advanced methods extensive amounts of data will be generated and need to be analyzed to extract useful information about the participants, their demographics, contact patterns, and behaviors during the event. Social media such as twitter can provide an alternative data sources about these events. Analyzing tweets posted by the participants can provide insights about their behaviors, movements and the event itself, which can be used when modeling disease spread. Moreover, simulating vastly increasing and high dimensional heterogeneous data representing the populations at global MGs provide a great big data challenge. As there is a need to integrate individual differences when modeling disease transmission at each stage of the event. In fact, some recent studies are aiming to include genetic variation among individuals when modeling infectious diseases and to use pathogens' genetic profiles to construct epidemics [33] , which will result in having to process vast amount of genetic data.",

In addition, modeling epidemics in global MGs needs to handle the multiple spatial scales as the participants in these events arrive from different geographical locations and gathered in a specific local space. Even within the setting of the event the participants can go back and forth to different locations either randomly (e.g. audience at Olympic games) or following a specific rituals (e.g. pilgrims at Hajj).

These studies should provide reliable methods to determine or adequately estimate the incoming and outgoing travel patterns, the event size and setting, and the characteristics of the expected population. These studies should also identify the best methodologies to utilize and integrate these data into disease-spread models.
