This sustained epidemic curve is a result of successive waves of different respiratory viruses moving through the community (Figure 26-1\n). The epidemic begins with a sharp rise in the frequency of rhinovirus infections in September (after children return to school), which is followed by PIVs in October and November. RSV and HCoVs circulate during the winter months, whereas infection due to influenza virus peaks in the late winter. The epidemic finally ends with a small resurgence of rhinovirus infections in the spring. Adenovirus infection occurs at a constant rate throughout the cold season.5\n",

Colds can be spread by: (1) small-particle (<5 \u00b5m in diameter) aerosol, which infects when inhaled; or (2) large-particle (>10 \u00b5m in diameter) droplets, which infect by landing on nasal or conjunctival mucosa; or (3) direct transfer via hand-to-hand contact.7 Small-particle aerosol is an effective method of transfer for influenza virus8 and coronavirus9 but not for RSV.10 Rhinoviruses are most likely spread by large-particle droplets or direct transfer. Rhinoviruses can survive as long as 2 hours on human hands and up to several days on other surfaces. Studies in young adults have shown that infected individuals commonly have rhinovirus on their hands, which can be efficiently transferred to the hands of uninfected individuals during brief contact; infection then results when the uninfected person transfers the virus from the hands on to his or her nasal or conjunctival mucosa. Sneezing and coughing are ineffective modes of rhinovirus transmission,11 although there is some evidence that virus could also be transmitted by aerosols generated by coughing, talking, and breathing.12 Inoculation of the oral mucosa with rhinovirus13 or RSV14 does not result in infection.",

Nasal washings of volunteers experimentally infected with rhinovirus showed a 100-fold increase in PMN concentration 1 to 2 days after inoculation.20 This influx of PMNs coincides with onset of symptoms and correlates with the presence of a colored nasal discharge.21 A yellow or white nasal discharge may result from the higher number of PMNs, whereas the enzymatic activity of PMNs (due to myeloperoxidase and other enzymes) may cause a green nasal discharge. A potent chemoattractant for PMNs is produced by cells in culture infected with rhinovirus.22 This chemoattractant has been identified as interleukin-8 (IL-8).23 Elevated levels of IL-8 and other cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, IL-6) also have been demonstrated in the nasal secretions of infected individuals.24, 25 Furthermore, elevated levels of albumin and kinins (predominantly bradykinin) in nasal secretions have been shown to coincide with the onset of symptoms in experimental rhinovirus infection.20 The elevated concentration of albumin and kinins likely results from exudation of plasma proteins due to greater vascular permeability in the nasal submucosa. The method by which viral infection initiates this vascular leak has not yet been determined. The release of kinins resulting from plasma exudation may augment the symptoms of the cold; bradykinin alone can cause rhinitis and sore throat when sprayed into the noses of uninfected individuals.26\n",

In another study, MRI revealed that 60% of children with upper respiratory tract infections had major abnormalities in their paranasal sinuses; these tended to resolve without antibiotic therapy.28 It is not known whether these sinus abnormalities result from viral infection of the sinus mucosa or from impaired sinus drainage secondary to viral rhinitis.

For children with underlying reactive airways disease, wheezing is common during the course of a viral URI; at least 50% of asthma exacerbations in children are associated with viral infection.

Vaccines are unlikely to be useful for prevention, given the large number of serotypes of some cold viruses as well as the lack of lasting immunity to others. The use of alcohol-based hand gels has been suggested as a means of reducing secondary transmission of respiratory illnesses in the home,45 but this was not shown to be effective in one field trial.46 Also, virucidal tissues have been shown to be effective in preventing viral passage and transmission, and may reduce secondary transmission by about 30%.47, 48 Until new methods are developed, prevention of the common cold is limited to avoiding self-inoculation (transfer of virus from contaminated fingers to nasal or conjunctival mucosa) by removing virus through handwashing or by killing virus with application of a virucide to the hands.",
