Diseases affecting the venous or lymphatic systems of the lung will affect this region, e.g., \"perilobular\" patterns. -The centrilobular structures: consist of the intralobular arterial and bronchial branches. In normal conditions, it is possible to identify the lobular artery (1 mm), the terminal artery (0.7 mm), and the acinar artery (0.5 mm). The bronchial branches contain air and cannot be visualized as their wall thickness is inferior to the lower limit of resolution on HRCT (0.15 mm). When the bronchiolar lumens become plugged with dense materials such as fluids, blood, or pus, the tracings of the intralobular branches become visible on HRCT as branched structures terminating in small nodules (tree-in-bud appearance). -The lobular parenchyma and acini: not visible on HRCT under normal conditions. They include the functional units of the lung, i.e., the alveoli and the capillary bed with their supportive structures of connective tissue (intralobular interstitium).

Infrequently, it progresses to honeycombing Superior lung fields Stage IV sarcoidosis Can cause honeycombing prevalently in the superior lobes. Fibrous bands are present from the hilum along the bronchovascular bundles Chronic hypersensitivity pneumonitis Honeycombing can develop in the superior and middle regions, with relative basal sparing.
