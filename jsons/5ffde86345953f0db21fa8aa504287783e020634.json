Many functional properties of proteins are determined by their participation in protein-protein complexes, in a temporal and/or spatial manner. To resolve the limitation of application in using mouse primary antibodies on archival, multiple formalin-fixed mouse tissue samples, which were collected from experiments requiring high biocontainment, we developed a practical strategic proximity ligation assay (PLA) capable of employing one primary antibody raised in mouse to probe talin-vinculin spatial proximal complex in mouse tissue. We observed an increase of talin-vinculin spatial proximities in the livers of spotted fever Rickettsia australis or Ebola virusinfected mice when compared with mock mice. Furthermore, using EPAC1-knockout mice, we found that deletion of EPAC1 could suppress the formation of spatial proximal complex of talin-vinculin in rickettsial infections. In addition, we observed increased colocalization between spatial proximity of talin-vinculin and filamentous actin-specific phalloidin staining in single survival mouse from an ordinarily lethal dose of rickettsial or Ebola virus infection.

Talin and vinculin, both as adapter proteins for the dynamic interaction between the transmembrane receptor integrin and actin cytoskeleton, play important roles, in particular in transmitting mechanosignals to regulate cell structure and function [2] [3] [4] [5] . Talin is a ubiquitous cytosolic protein, predominantly detected at regions of cell-substratum or cell-cell adhesions [2] [3] [4] . Talin functions as an adapter for integrin in forming mechanosensitive intercellular or cellextracellular matrix (ECM) tensions, generating cell-cell junctions or focal adhesions between cell and ECM, respectively [6] [7] [8] . Via the dynamic correlation with its binding partner, vinculin, talin has been documented to participate in establishing bacterial infections via its role as the adapter to mediate the cytoskeleton-driven dynamics of the plasma membrane [5, [9] [10] [11] [12] . Bacteria have been shown to directly manipulate host subcellular actin-mediated pulling force to promote intercellular spread [5, 13, 14] , including the spotted fever group (SFG) of Rickettsia (R.) spp [12] . To promote cell-cell spread, R. parkeri secrets surface cell antigen 4 to interact with vinculin and block the association between vinculin and another binding partner, \u03b1-catenin, reducing vinculin-dependent mechanotransduction at cell-cell junctions [5] . Therefore, SFGRs have evolved a strategy to target vinculin-based host cytoskeletal force generation to enable spread.

Protein-protein interactions (PPIs) include highly specific physical contacts/linkages between two or more protein molecules. In a specific biomolecular context, physical contacts are established spatially between special chains of protein molecules [18] [19] [20] . Technologically, the association between proteins can be clarified by immunoprecipitation, which is performed coupling with western blot (WB) to test target proteins, requiring homogenization of sample and resulting in losing spatial information about the targets, both at intraand intercellular levels [21] . Colocalization of different proteins with fluorescence microscopy is frequently used to assess their potential association in situ. However, colocalization under epifluorescent/confocal fluorescent microscope does not necessarily mean a physical interaction [7] . A practical step toward unraveling the complex molecular relationship, temporal and spatial, of protein-toprotein physical interaction is essential for accomplishing a comprehensive knowledge of the functional outcomes of a PPI [8] . The concept of spatial proximity between two protein targets is merging to be a practical approach for endogenous quantitative detection of spatial proximal complex of proteins at the single molecule level in fixed cells and tissue samples. Currently, in situ application of proximity ligation assay (PLA) is used to visualize the spatial proximal signals of two protein targets in tissue samples [22, 23] , directly examining proximal interaction between the proteins, in responses to different stimuli [24] . However, the commercially available PLA assay (Sigma Aldrich) restricted the use of primary antibody raised in mouse on murine samples due to the antibody incompatibility between the kit and the sample. Furthermore, traditional histological fixatives (e.g., formaldehyde or glutaraldehyde) cause strong chemical crosslinking of proteins, which impede detection of many sensitive antigens [25] [26] [27] . Our formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue samples were collected during experiments requiring high biocontainment, for which multiple 10% formalin fixation steps are mandatory, leading to heavy antigen masking.

Histology-based quantitative data from the PLA indicate increased TVSP complexes in response to both SFGR and EBOV infections. To our knowledge, these are the first reported direct images of signals of TVSP in liver during acute infections. We further observed that TVSP in liver increased after infections with R. australis in an EPAC1-dependent manner, suggesting a potential new molecular basis underpinning this aberration in liver. Talin, one of the most abundant components in cells, is a ubiquitous cytosolic protein concentrated at regions of cell-substratum contact in cellular environments [2] [3] [4] . It is a long rod-like protein, one end of which contains an integrin binding site, while the other end contains an actinbinding domain. At rest, Rap1-GTP-interacting adapter molecule (RIAM) binds to the closed R3 domain of talin and anchors it to the cell membrane. When actin filaments are pulled, the R3 domain will undergo a conformational change, which causes RIAM to dissociate and vinculin to bind [7, 41] . Talin is a mechanosensitive molecule and this mechanosensitivity relates to the interaction of talin with vinculin [42, 43] . Vinculin is a major talin-binding partner that facilitates crosstalk between talin and actin through its talin-binding head domain (V-head) and its actin-binding tail domain (V-tail) [44, 45] . Vinculin is also a central component of mechanosensitive adhesive complexes that forms between cells and the ECM [8] . The force-dependent interaction between talin and vinculin plays a crucial role in the initiation and growth of focal adhesions [6, 7] . Given identification of a talin-binding site localized within the N-terminal vinculin head domain [44, 45] and characterization of the functional role of talin-vinculin interplay to regulate actin-based cell membrane dynamics in response to mechanosignals [7, 41] , it is important to delineate the mechanism(s) targeting talin-vinculin interaction, in particular their dynamic spatial proximity, in pathophysiological context. Evidence from developmental studies suggests a high level of spatial proximity between talin and vinculin in response to mechnosignals [46] .

Due to its role as a filter, the liver is exposed to many systemic infectious pathogens. These pathogens may directly or indirectly affect the liver depending on the characteristics of the pathogens [50] . Liver inflammation due to various etiologies can result in liver fibrosis, leading to cirrhosis and carcinogenesis [51] . Vinculin participates in enhancing bacterial infection and the inflammatory response through underpinning integrin, which binds to ECM proteins, many bacterial pathogens and viruses [9] [10] [11] [12] . Besides this, talin and vinculin, two interacting proteins that localize in focal adhesions to mediate integrin linkage to the actin cytoskeleton, function during viral infection [48] . However, whether talin or vinculin are involved in the pathophysiological processes in the liver during systemic infections is not yet clear. EBOV, a member of the family Filoviridae, is a major human pathogen and causes severe EBOV disease in humans and non-human primates with case-fatality rates in humans of up to 90% [52] [53] [54] [55] [56] . On July 17, 2019, WHO declared global health emergency as the current Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (https://www.bbc.com/news/health-49025298). Rickettsioses represent devastating human infections [57] . Untreated or misdiagnosed SFGR infections are frequently associated with severe morbidity and mortality [58] [59] [60] [61] [62] . It has been forecasted that increased ambient temperature under conditions of global climate change is a driver in rickettsial epidemiology, leading to more widespread distribution of rickettsioses [63] . The intracellular pathogen Rickettsia manipulates intercellular tension via a secreted effector protein to promote engulfment of protrusions and cell-to-cell spread [5] . Whether these interacting proteins, talin and vinculin, play a role in the progress of these deadly infectious diseases still needs further exploration. In order to explore the TVSP in liver during these dread diseases, we chose to utilize our archival sample from Ebola and SFGR infected mice.

As such, a number of microbial pathogens have evolved a set of diverse virulence-enhancing strategies that exploit the cAMP signaling pathways of their hosts [65] . In multicellular eukaryotic organisms, the effects of cAMP are transduced by two ubiquitously expressed intracellular cAMP receptors, the classic cAMP-dependent protein kinase A and the more recently discovered exchange proteins directly activated by cAMP (EPAC) [66] . To date, two isoforms, EPAC1 and EPAC2, have been identified in humans. They are produced by independent genes, and predominantly expressed in different cell types, but both act on the same immediate downstream effectors [67, 68] . EPAC proteins function by responding to increased intracellular cAMP levels and activating the immediate downstream effectors, the Ras superfamily small GTPases Rap1 and Rap2. We have been interested in host cAMP signaling pathways, EPAC1 in particular, for their possible roles in rickettsial adhesion and invasion. We performed in vivo analyses using EPAC1-KO mouse [69] and EPAC-specific inhibitors (ESIs). We found that the deletion of the EPAC1 gene protected mice from an ordinarily lethal dose of rickettsiae (2 \u00d7 10 6 PFU of R. australis) [30] . Most importantly, pharmacological inhibition of EPAC1 by ESI09, an ESI, in mice [70] mimicked the EPAC1-KO phenotype. ESI09 treatment dramatically decreased the morbidity and mortality associated with fatal spotted fever rickettsioses [30] . In addition, in vitro investigations demonstrated that EPAC1 inhibition suppressed rickettsial adherence to and invasion into ECs. However, aside from what we have shown, little is known regarding the precise mechanism underlying the role of EPAC1 in fatal rickettsioses. Observations from the present study provide a fresh insight into the mechanism(s) underlying the pathogenesis of SFGR infections, regarding the potential role of the spatial proximal complex of talin-vinculin. For instance, cytokines were documented to regulate talin-relevant [71] and vinculin-relevant [72] cytoskeletal dynamics in cells. \"Cytokine storm\" has been well known as central host responses during SFGR [32] or EBOV [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] infections.

PPIs have been studied from different perspectives: biochemistry, quantum chemistry, molecular dynamics, and signal transduction, among others [72, 73] , and a multitude of methods have been applied to detect the PPIs [20] . The most conventional methods are yeast two-hybrid screening and affinity purification coupled to mass spectrometry [74] . However, these approaches have a common limitation that all work on cells or tissue homogenates, thus missing critical compartmental information in cell biology or histology. Moreover, these methods have their own disadvantages, respectively, limiting wider applications accurately. The main criticism of the yeast two-hybrid screen of PPIs is the possibility of a high number of false-positive (and false-negative) identifications [75] . This partly clarifies the overlap, often found very minimal, in results when using a (high throughput) two-hybrid screening, especially when using different experimental systems [76] [77] [78] . In addition, the colocalization of proteins can be clarified by immunoprecipitation, which is performed with beads to isolate proteins, followed by WB to test target proteins [79] ; fluorescence colocalization microscopy is frequently used to assess potential links between distinct molecules; however, this method can lead to striking false-positive results and erroneous conclusions [80, 81] . Furthermore, colocalization does not necessarily mean a physical interaction [80] . A practical step toward unraveling the complex molecular relationship, temporal and spatial, of protein-to-protein physical interaction is essential for accomplishing a comprehensive knowledge of the functional outcomes [82] . Since detection of protein-protein proximity has been developed to probe the proximal PPI in native environment [16, 83, 84] , PLA is being more and more widely used in tissues and cells [22, 23] . In a typical PLA experiment, two antibodies are used to recognize two proteins of interest. Each antibody is conjugated to a short sequence of oligonucleotides that are complementary to each other. When these probes are in the proximity of less than 40 nm, the addition of two connector oligonucleotides that hybridize with the probes will lead to the formation of a closed circle template in the presence of a ligase [24, 83] .

Combining the results of PLA with one of these routine assays could provide more robust information, especially if identical primary antibodies are employed in these assays, suggesting the importance of developing strategies to perform PLA on mouse samples using primary antibodies raised in mouse. In this study, the infected samples were all of mouse origin. Through setting up a practical and scientific strategy, we explored the feasibility of using primary antibodies from sample species in PLA. Outcomes from this mouse-on-mouse PLA exhibited promising signal intensities and clean backgrounds.
