However, it is now believed as a bio-invasion in North America, South America and Oceania (Lloyd et al. 2003). According to \u2018Ben Cao Gang Mu\u2019 (AD 1552\u20131578), the herbalism masterpiece which was known as the ancient Chinese encyclopedia, JYH was described as a commonly used herb to treat fever, phyma and sore. Modern pharmacological study has confirmed the antiviral, antibacterial and anti-inflammatory activities of JYH, supporting the traditional applications (Kang et al. 2004; Kao et al. 2015; Shi et al. 2016). Likewise, pharmacological study showed antioxidative, anti-tumour, liver protective and hypoglycemic activities of JYH (Jiang et al. 2014; Kong et al. 2017; Zhao et al. 2018; Park et al. 2012a). So far, more than 300 compounds have been isolated and identified from JYH, including phenolic acids, flavonoids, saponins, iridoids, etc. (Yang et al. 2016; Ni 2017; Lin et al. 2008).",

There are 312 Chinese patent medicines (CPMs) and 163 domestic health food containing JYH according to the data of National Scientific Data Sharing Platform for Population and Health (http://www.ncmi.cn/) and China Food and Drug Administration (CFDA, www.sfda.gov.cn/). The standard of JYH was first recorded in Chinese Pharmacopoeia (ChP) in 1963, limiting JYH medicinal part to dried flower buds of Lonicera japonica Thunberg. In 1977 Edition ChP, JYH had four plant origins, including L. japonica, Lonicera hypoglauca Miquel, Lonicera confusa DeCandolle and Lonicera dasystyla Rehder. Meanwhile, the medicinal parts were dried flower buds or initial flowers. This standard did not change in the subsequent 1985, 1990, 1995, and 2000 Edition ChP. In 2005 Edition ChP, JYH and Lonicerae flos (called Shanyinhua, SYH in Chinese) were listed as two herbs. The plant origin of JYH was changed to be consistent with that of 1963 Edition ChP, being L. japonica, while SYH was a multi-origins herb and plant origins were L. hypoglauca, L. confusa and Lonicera macranthoides Handel-Mazzetti. In 2010 Edition ChP, Lonicera fulvotomentosa Hsu et Cheng was listed as a new plant origin of SYH. Since then, there have been four plant origins of SYH.",

            "text": "Since JYH and SYH were listed as two herbs, controversies on their quality standards and interchangeability are ceaselessly due to their close proximity on plant species and appearances, together with traditional applications and great homogeneity regarding their medicinal uses. Meanwhile, owing to higher price of JYH, JYH is often adulterated with SYH motivated by economic interests. Furthermore, pharmaceutical companies need to provide scientific evidence to the Pharmacopoeia Committee if they want to change crude materials in CPMs from JYH to SYH (http://samr.cfda.gov.cn/WS01/CL0844/10570.html). Last but not least, there is a synonymy problem of SYH plant origins that was not mentioned in ChP. According to ThePlantList and eFloras, L. macranthoides and L. fulvotomentosa are synonymies of Lonicera macrantha (D.Don) Spreng, and L. dasystyla is actually a synonymy of L. confusa (http://flora.huh.harvard.edu/china/mss/volume19/Flora_of_China_Volume_19_Caprifoliaceae.pdf, http://www.theplantlist.org/tpl1.1/record/kew-2339927). Hence, a complete review on similarities and differences of JYH and SYH is timely. In this review, we introduce botanies and ethnopharmacology of JYH and SYH, and discuss their similarities and differences with respect of phytochemistry, pharmacological activities and toxicology by systematically reviewing studies performed on JYH and SYH in recent decades. A critical evaluation of pharmacological studies in terms of their relation to ethnopharmacology is also provided. We generalize factors that affect their qualities and present quality control methods. Meanwhile, bioavailability of major compounds and clinical uses of JYH productions have also been mentioned. Above all, we provide an accurate cognition of JYH and SYH, and propose deficiencies on present studies so as to further research can use for reference.",

L. dasystyla is a synonym of L. confusa (www.theplantlist.org/, http://www.efloras.org/). However, they are regarded as different herbs by not a few researchers nowadays (Ou et al. 2011; Lim 2014). This is possibly due to they were once listed as two herbs in ChP for quite a long time. Moreover, L. macranthoides and L. fulvotomentosa were listed as two different plants in 2010 and 2015 Edition ChP, while they were synonyms of L. macrantha according to The Plant List and eFloras (www.theplantlist.org/, http://www.efloras.org/). As far as current research is concerned, it is difficult to point out their similarities or differences. Thereby studies on genetic diversity and relationships should be conducted. An evaluation of pharmacological studies of them should also be high-lighted.",

According to 2015 Edition ChP, stems of L. japonica are used medicinally, called Lonicera Japonica Caulis. Yet leaves, non-medicinal part of L. japonica, have not been fully utilized. Modern studies have confirmed that flowers, stems and leaves of L. japonica have similar chemical compounds with a variety of pharmacological activities. Flavonoids in L. japonica were degressively abundant in leaves, flowers and stems, and leaves showed the highest antioxidative intensity than those of flowers or stems (Seo et al. 2012). Tian found that phenolic acids in flowers and leaves were similar and both were higher than that in stems (Tian et al. 2019), and these results could also be found in SYH (Chen et al. 2015b; Yuan et al. 2014). Meanwhile, powder of SYH leaves has already been used as dietary supplementation in animal diets (Long et al. 2016). In China, JYH has been used as tea for a long time. The sales of Wanglaoji (trade name), a tea beverage containing JYH, exceeded that of Coca-Cola in 2018. The supply of JYH is not adequate to the demand (http://www.sohu.com), while leaves of L. japonica are wasted greatly despite having a long history as tea (Wang et al. 2008). Leaves of L. japonica have been considered as medicinal part in Japan and Korea according to the Japanese Pharmacopoeia and the Korean Pharmacopoeia. Therefore, in China, leaves of L. japonica and SYH origins should be valued in further studies.",

Meanwhile, the presence of a second hydroxy group in the ortho or para position of phenolic acids could increase their antioxidant capacity. A wide range of researches demonstrate that changes of antioxidant intensity are always closely associated with the variation of the contents of phenolic acids (Porter et al. 2010; Farhat et al. 2014; Ben Farhat et al. 2015).",

To study the bioavailability of CGA that extracted from JYH, Zhou gave 42 rats 400 mg kg\u22121 JYH 85% ethanol extractions (yielding an extraction with the content of 16.7% CGA) by intravenous (i.v), intramuscular (i.m) and intragastrical (i.g) administration. t1/2 of i.v, i.m and i.g administration were 0.44, 0.50 and 0.38 h, and AUC0\u2192\u221e were 6931.62, 6550.34 and 2591.87 \u03bcg h L\u22121. The absolute bioavailability of CGA by i.g administration was only 37.39% (Ting et al. 2014). Chen developed a self-microemulsifying drug delivery system (SMEDDS) to improve the oral bioavailability of CGA. Compared with control group (CGA alone, tmax = 0.1 h, Cmax = 82.6 \u03bcg mL\u22121), CGA-SMEDDS group had a peak concentration of 47.6 \u03bcg mL\u22121 and the peak time was delayed to 2.4 h (Chen et al. 2017).",

Luteolin (89) is a tetrahydroxyflavone in which the four hydroxy groups are located at positions 3\u2032, 4\u2032, 5 and 7. It has been reported to possess anti-angiogenic activity in human umbilical vein endothelial cells and human retinal microvascular endothelial cells (below 5 \u03bcM, in vitro), which contributed to the inhibition on the pathogenesis of retinopathy of prematurity and tumor growth (Eleni et al. 2004; Park et al. 2012b). Luteolin (89), as well as cynaroside (88) a derived glycoside of luteolin that is substituted by a \u03b2-d-glucopyranosyl moiety at the position 7 via a glycosidic linkage of luteolin, is active against inflammation. Odontuya reported that the anti-inflammatory effect of luteolin and cynaroside was dependent on their molecular structures, that is to say the presence of ortho-dihydroxy groups at the B ring and hydroxy substitution pattern at C-5 position of the A ring could significantly contribute to anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities of flavones (Odontuya et al. 2010).",

Measuring COX activity and mRNA expression, the results showed that lonimacranthoide VI (281, 10 \u03bcmol L\u22121) from L. macranthoides could inhibit mRNA expression and COX-2 activity in vitro, indicating lonimacranthoide VI (281) an important anti-inflammatory compound of SYH (Guan et al. 2014a). However, available evidence indicates that saponins have the potentiality to trigger cytotoxicity, and the sequence \u03b1-l-Rhap-(1 \u2192 2)-\u03b1-l-Arap in oleanolic acid or hederagenin is the characteristic of a more cytotoxic saponin (Park et al. 2001; Barthomeuf et al. 2002; Chwalek et al. 2006).

The mechanism of anti-inflammatory activity of Gingyo-san was attenuating expressions of TNF-\u03b1, IL-1, IL-6, and activating NF-\u03baB in BALF and lung tissue. Particularly, Gingyo-san also enhanced the expression of IL-10 (Yeh et al. 2007).",

N-Acetylcysteine (NAC, 600 mg/kg as positive control) chould also obviously ameliorate AP-induced liver injury. Detected by cell viability (CV) assay, AP-induced cytotoxicity in human normal liver L-02 cells could be reversed by CGA (1), isochlorogenic acid A\u2013C (3\u20135) and CA (62) of JYH, while flavonoids [cynaroside (88), luteolin (89), hyperoside (130)], iridoids (swertiamarin) and essential oils [linalool (295) and geraniol (325)] had no protective activities against AP-induced hepatotoxicity. Thus, JYH could prevent AP-induced liver injury in vivo by inhibiting apoptosis, and phenolic acids may be the main hepato-protective active compounds in JYH (Jiang et al. 2014). What\u2019s more, phenolic acids alleviating AP-induced hepatotoxicity could also prevent liver injury induced by various chemical compounds such as carbon tetrachloride and thioacetamide (Wu et al. 2007; Mancini-Filho et al. 2009). On the other study, SYH saponins were reported to exert protective activities on liver injury in vitro and in vivo caused by acetaminophen, Cd, and CCl4 distinctly (Ferrazzano et al. 2009; Ji et al. 2013). In d-aminogalactose and CCl4-induced liver injury rats, water extractions of both L. macranthoides and L. fulvotomentosa (150 mg kg\u22121) showed liver protective activities (Shi et al. 1999). These results revealed that JYH and SYH had potential to be developed as a new drug against liver injury. However, these studies lacked positive control and further studies require more in-depth, including exploring the related pathways and searching for the targets.",

By means of fluorescence microscopy, L. confusa was further identified with its transverse section partially distributing fluorescence materials (Chu et al. 2011). Through ultra HPLC with triple quadrupole mass spectrometry technology, cynaroside (88), sweroside (143), macranthoidin A (265), macranthoidin B (266) and dipsacoside B (269) have been quantified as internal standard substances to check SYH adulterated in JYH preparations. The results showed that JYH could be easily distinguished from SYH by the total amount of saponins (0.067 mg g\u22121 for JYH and > 45.8 mg g\u22121 for SYH).",

The results indicated that ITS2 barcodes could be used to identify adulterants and JYH was one of the most adulterant species. Notably, given that some samples were heavily processed and there was no DNA barcoding in artificial adulterant sample, DNA barcoding technology was not sufficient to identify any given samples. In other words, DNA barcoding technology could be used to establish the authenticity of herbs or CPMs, but could not be used to evaluate the quality of herbs or CPMs (Han et al. 2016). Employing the modified cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide method, genomic DNA was isolated from Fu Fang Yu Xing Cao Tablet, Lin Yang Gan Mao Tablet and Yin Qiao Jie Du Tablet (names of CPMs), which all contained JYH. Jiang used sequence and phylogenetic analyses to detect the species in prescriptions and the results showed that the above three CPMs were actually adulterated with SYH.

In vivo, macranthoidin B (266) (0.110 and 0.055 mg g\u22121) and dipsacoside B (269) (0.020 and 0.010 mg g\u22121) did not cause hemolysis (continuous tail vein administration for 7 days) (Wang et al. 2016). In another study, loniceroside A (236), loniceroside B (237) (the major saponins in JYH), macranthoidin A (265), dipsacoside B (269) and dipsacoside VI (270) (the major saponins in SYH) all did not cause hemolysis at the concentration of 1.0 mg mL\u22121 in vitro. The hemolysis rate of macranthoidin A (265) rose with its concentration increasing. No hemolysis occurred when the concentration of macranthoidin A (265) was 0.6 mg mL\u22121, and the hemolysis rate was 50.4% when the concentration of macranthoidin A (265) reached 1.0 mg mL\u22121. When comes to the hemolysis of JYH compounds, the strength decreased as the following order, saponins, phenolic acids, iridoids. When the concentrations of iridoids were 0.1\u20131.2 mg mL\u22121 or phenolic acids was less than 1.0 mg mL\u22121, no hemolysis occurred. However, hemolysis occurred when the concentration of saponins was 0.6 mg mL\u22121, and the hemolysis rate rose rapidly with the concentration further increasing. The hemolysis rate was 55.3% when the concentration of saponins in JYH reached 1.2 mg mL\u22121. Last but not least, the results showed that there were no significant differences in hemolysis between JYH representative compounds and SYH representative compounds in rabbit red blood cells (P > 0.05) (Huang et al. 2017). Additionally, L. macranthoides 70% ethanol extraction (5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100 mg L\u22121) and JYH extraction (0.5 g mL\u22121) did not cause hemolysis in vitro (Wang et al. 2016; Dai et al. 2016). In brief, hemolysis of JYH and SYH may be closely related to saponins, although the hemolysis strength of saponins was not strong (P > 0.05). The hemolysis of SYH may be related to the inclusion of macranthoidin A (265) in some of its plant origins.",

The release rate of \u03b2-hexosaminidase of SYH water extraction (1.46 g kg\u22121) was higher than that of JYH water extraction (1.25 g kg\u22121) in vitro. SYH water extraction was more likely to stimulate the degranulation of basophilic mast cells than JYH water extraction. Thereby, the allergic reaction of SYH water extraction was more severe than that of JYH water extraction (Zhang 2014). Additionally, about four hundred million patients are treated with traditional Chinese medicine injections (TCMI) in China per year. Among TCMI, intravenous SHL has the highest risk of injection-induced immediate hypersensitivity reactions (IHRs). IHRs were attributed to the intermediate fraction F2 coming from JYH and Forsythiae Fructus in SHL injection. In Gao\u2019s study, Balb/c mice were intravenously injected with the SHLI (0.5 mL/mouse), F1 (the extraction of Scutellariae Radix, 4.81 mg/mouse), or F2 (16.5 mg/mouse), respectively. Thirty minutes later, the rectal temperature was measured. F2 contributed to obvious hypothermia, while F1 has no effect on the mouse\u2019s temperature. After intravenously injecting with 5 mg mL\u22121 Evans Blue (1 mL), a representative image of Evans Blue extravasation of mouse paw was observed in F2 group.

In light of its long traditional use to cool blood and relieve dysentery, the relationship between the traditional use and modern therapy of JYH against virus has also been established. However, SYH is more likely for local use only. The correlation between modern usage and traditional use of SYH remains unclear. More investigations of ethnomedicinal remedies of SYH should been conducted. These findings are crucial for a better understanding of the alternative strategy of JYH and SYH and to help in the authentication of them. In brief, the traditional uses of JYH have already been substantiated by modern pharmacological studies. In Asia, JYH and SYH are often used as tea. As the above said, bioactive components (especially CGA) of them have already been deeply explored. Due to the good and positive related anti-inflammatory, antiviral and antibacterial activities, CGA was used as marker to evaluate the chemical quality of JYH and SYH.

As far as pharmacological studies of JYH and SYH, many in vitro and in vivo experiments demonstrate that they are pharmacologically similar, but also differ in some aspects. For instance, JYH is more powerful in antibacterial activity than SYH, while SYH possesses a higher intensity than JYH in antioxidative activity.
