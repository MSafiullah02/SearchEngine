Here, we link host susceptibility to viral infection to a network encompassing sulfur metabolism, tRNA modification, competitive binding, and programmed ribosomal frameshifting (PRF). We first demonstrate that the iron-sulfur cluster biosynthesis pathway in Escherichia coli exerts a protective effect during lambda phage infection, while a tRNA thiolation pathway enhances viral infection. We show that tRNA Lys uridine 34 modification inhibits PRF to influence the ratio of lambda phage proteins gpG and gpGT. Computational modeling and experiments suggest that the role of the iron-sulfur cluster biosynthesis pathway in infection is indirect, via competitive binding of the shared sulfur donor IscS. Based on the universality of many key components of this network, in both the host and the virus, we anticipate that these findings may have broad relevance to understanding other infections, including viral infection of humans.",

            "text": "During PRF, the translational machinery slips backward or forward by one nucleotide while decoding a so-called 'slippery sequence,' a heptanucleotide sequence of the form XXXYYYZ in the mRNA transcript ( Figure 1 ). Outside of PRF, frameshifting is a rare event, occurring fewer than 5 \u00c210 \u00c05 times per codon (Kurland, 1992) . PRF can increase the occurrence of frameshifting by several orders of magnitude, depending on the slippery sequence itself as well as on the presence or absence of adjacent secondary structures that favor translational pausing and increase frameshift frequency (Gesteland and Atkins, 1996) . In many instances of PRF, slippage causes the translational machinery to bypass a stop codon just downstream of the slippery sequence, resulting in the expression of an elongated protein (Gesteland and Atkins, 1996) . Therefore, normal expression from these transcripts results in two products, a shorter product based on the initial translation frame plus a longer product, whose ratio depends on the frequency of slippage and is thought to have evolved to a value optimized for virus production (Shehu-Xhilaga et al, 2001; Dulude et al, 2006) .",

For example, in HIV, the Gag to Gag-Pol expression ratio is regulated by PRF and is necessary for the proper loading of reverse transcriptase into the new viral capsids; disturbing this ratio can inhibit viral replication (Shehu-Xhilaga et al, 2001; Dulude et al, 2006) . The role of PRF in the SARS life cycle is less clear, but is necessary for expression of its RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Plant et al, 2010) . In Escherichia coli bacteriophage lambda, PRF regulates the expression of proteins gpG and gpGT (Levin et al, 1993) . As lambda phage genes G and T lie between its major tail gene (V) and its tape measure gene (H), they are thought to have a role in tail formation (Xu, 2001) . However, proteins gpG and gpGT do not make up any of the final tail structure (Levin et al, 1993) , and thus may act as chaperones or scaffolds for gpH, assisting in the assembly of the tail shaft around the tape measure protein (Xu, 2001) .",

However, their loss is generally not lethal (Alexandrov et al, 2006; Phizicky and Hopper, 2010) . In E. coli, four tRNA modifications require the addition of a thiol moiety and are made via two functionally distinct mechanisms (Nilsson et al, 2002) . The first mechanism requires proteins that contain iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters and includes 2-thiocytidine formation at position 32 and methylthio formation of ms2i6A at position 37 (Jager et al, 2004; Pierrel et al, 2004) . The second mechanism is independent of Fe-S clusters and includes 4-thiouridine at position 8 and 2-thiouridine at position 34 (Ikeuchi et al, 2006) . For each of these modifications, sulfur is sequestered by E. coli's primary cysteine desulfurase, IscS. Sulfur is then used for one of these four tRNA modifications or for Fe-S cluster biosynthesis. In addition to their roles in tRNA modification, Fe-S clusters are critical cofactors involved in many cellular processes including respiration, central metabolism, environmental sensing, RNA modification, DNA repair, and DNA replication (Py and Barras, 2010) .",

We were particularly intrigued by the possibility that these pathways interact. Furthermore, the substantial evolutionary conservation of both host genes and viral PRF mechanism strongly suggested that our observations would have relevance beyond E. coli and lambda phage. Our current observations shed light on a complex network that extends from host metabolism and tRNA modification to viral translational regulation and finally to virion production. We find that 2-thiouridine hypomodification of tRNA Lys/Glu/Gln causes increased translational frameshifting, changing the ratio of the critical lambda phage proteins gpG and gpGT. We also show that IscU is linked to gpG and gpGT expression by competitive inhibition of the TUS pathway. Knocking out core members of the ISC pathway increases lambda phage replication by relieving competition for sulfur, allowing the TUS pathway to increase the rates of 2thiouridine formation, thus reducing frameshifting. Targeting tRNA modifications to alter frameshifting rates, to which viral structural proteins are likely to be uniquely sensitive, presents a novel antiviral strategy.",

The DiscU culture entered the lytic phase very quickly (red curve, Figure 2B ), while the infected DtusA strain grew in exponential phase substantially longer than the WT strain, leading to a higher turbidity before the lytic phase occurred (green curve). We therefore decided to classify strains that entered the lytic phase earlier as more susceptible to viral infection (red) and those that entered the lytic phase later as less susceptible (green). This susceptibility classification was consistent with our earlier plaque assay experiments (Maynard et al, 2010) . Figure 1 Programmed ribosomal frameshifting. Schematic of a \u00c01 programmed ribosomal frameshift. P-site tRNA slips in the \u00c01 direction at the 'slippery sequence.' We then defined a metric to compare the resistance of different strains with infection with phage lambda. One useful way to summarize the information contained in a time course is to consider each experiment as a vector in n-dimensional space, where n is the number of time points taken. In earlier work, we found that it was useful to normalize these infection time course experiment vectors by the growth rate (Maynard et al, 2010) . However, we have since found that bacterial growth and viral growth are tightly linked, and our attempts to numerically correct for or eliminate the effect of bacterial growth rate often distorted the raw data. Bacterial growth is therefore an important (but not sufficient) consideration in classifying our strains.",

The displacement vector, which we call the 'host resistance', enables us to compare the magnitude and direction of each strain relative with the WTstrain and with each other.

We began our investigation by examining the impact of other known ISC and TUS pathway members on lambda phage replication ( Figure 3A ; see Supplementary Figure 1 for line plots of individual replicates). First, we investigated the effect on lambda phage replication of several genes associated with Fe-S cluster biosynthesis. We performed infection time courses of DiscU and other strains deficient in members of the iscRSUA-hscBA-fdx-iscX operon (hscA, hscB, iscA, iscR, fdx, and iscX). The slow growth of the iscS deletion strain made it impossible to assess infection dynamics and was not included in the analysis. The DiscU, DhscA, and DhscB strains all exhibited very similar infection dynamics, clearing the culture significantly before WT ( Figure 3A , top row; Figure 3B ). IscU is the primary scaffolding protein used for Fe-S cluster biosynthesis (Urbina et al, 2001) , and HscA and HscB are accessory proteins that help transfer Fe-S clusters to apoproteins (Bonomi et al, 2008) The DiscA strain exhibited increased replication efficiency, but less than the hscA, hscB, and iscU gene deletions ( Figure 3A and B). IscA assists in Fe-S cluster biosynthesis by shuttling iron to IscU (Yang et al, 2006) .",

TtcA catalyzes the 2-thiocytidine modification at position 32 of tRNA Arg (ICG), tRNA Arg (CCG), tRNA Arg (mnm5UCU), and tRNA Ser (CGU) (Jager et al, 2004) . DttcA strains displayed doubling times equivalent to WT E. coli ( Figure 3A , bottom), and little is known about the functional consequences of modification. Strains lacking either of these genes showed no effect on lambda infection dynamics ( Figure 3A , bottom; Figure 3C ). In contrast, deletion strains for the two Fe-S cluster-independent tRNA thiolation enzymes ThiI and MnmA displayed a Figure 3C ). Sulfur is transferred to ThiI through direct binding of IscS (Kambampati and Lauhon, 2000) , and ThiI then transfers the sulfur to s4U8 of tRNA Phe . Lambda replication in the DthiI strain was mildly but significantly inhibited ( Figure 3A , bottom; Figure 3C ). The DmnmA strain exhibited the most dramatic effect on viral infection of all the strains associated with tRNA thiolation. MnmA catalyzes 2-thiouridination at position 34 of several tRNAs (Kambampati and Lauhon, 2003) . Sulfur is supplied to MnmA through the TUS pathway, beginning with the direct binding of IscS by TusA (Ikeuchi et al, 2006) . The DmnmA strain underwent infection dynamics ( Figure 3A , bottom; Figure 3C ) very similar to the upstream TUS pathway gene deletion strains we characterized in a previous study (Maynard et al, 2010) , including DtusA, DtusBCD, and DtusE. All members of the TUS pathway had a strong, significant, and similar effect on lambda replication ( Figure 3A and C), leading (B) Displacement from the WT strain for ISC operon members (*Po0.05, **Po0.01, bars indicate 95% CI, P-values were calculated using independent two-sample t-test).",

To test this hypothesis, we generated infection curves for several deletion mutants that have been shown to affect frameshifting by loss of tRNA modification, including tgt, truA, miaA, thiI, and mnmE (Urbonavicius et al, 2001) . We infected deletion strains for these genes with lambda phage and determined their susceptibility to infection ( Dtgt, DmiaA, and DtruA exhibited no significant affect on lambda phage replication, suggesting that the tRNA modifications from these enzymes have no role in lambda phage replication. The remaining knockout strains displayed significant changes in lambda phage's ability to infect the host, including DthiI, DmnmA (Figures 3 and 4) , and DmnmE ( Figure 4) . Intriguingly, MnmE performs a methylaminomethyl modification on carbon 5 of the same tRNA species and nucleoside targeted by MnmA (Elseviers et al, 1984) , suggesting that the antiviral properties of the TUS pathway knockouts may be due to specific tRNA modifications instead of to general translational fidelity issues.",

The tRNA species modified by MnmA and MnmE decode the lysine, glutamic acid, and glutamine codons (Kambampati and Lauhon, 2003) ; we examined the codon usage for lysine, glutamic acid, and glutamine in lambda phage and in E. coli for synonymous codon usage bias. Lambda phage encodes lysine 748 times (65% AAA and 35% AAG), glutamic acid 900 times (57% GAA and 43% GAG), and glutamine 576 times (20% CAA and 80% CAG), with similar biases in E. coli (Table II) .

In particular, our attention was drawn to PRF as a specific instance of frameshifting that could be particularly sensitive to changes in frameshifting frequency. In lambda phage, PRF occurs during translation of the lambda phage GT region, which encodes two possible protein products, either gpG or gpGT; expression of gpGT depends on ribosomal frameshifting at the slippery sequence GGGTTTG (Levin et al, 1993) . This sequence encodes the dipeptide Gly-Lys in both the 0 open reading frame (ORF; GGT-TTG) and the \u00c01 ORF (GGG-TTT). In the 0 ORF, which is maintained B96% of the time, gpG is expressed ( Figure 5A ); and in the remaining cases, the ribosomal machinery reaches the slippery sequence and slips back one base pair. As a result, the stop codon for gpG, immediately downstream of the slippery sequence, is bypassed and the larger gpGT product is produced. Interestingly, both the lysine codons TTG (0 ORF) and TTT (\u00c01 ORF) are decoded by the same tRNA Lys (UUU), a target of MnmA and MnmE. We therefore wondered whether TUS pathway gene deletion strains would exhibit an altered rate of frameshifting and consequently a change in the ratio of gpG to gpGT.",

Furthermore, our observation that the miaB and ttcA deletion strains exhibited normal lambda phage replication (Figure 3 ) suggested that IscU does not act directly through thiolation of specific tRNA modifications. How, then, does IscU influence viral replication independent of direct tRNA modification? One possible answer is that IscU competes with TusA to bind IscS. Recent X-ray crystallography studies showed that IscU and TusA bind IscS at distinct but adjacent locations (Shi et al, 2010) . Superposition of the IscU and TusA structures indicated a spatial overlap between the volume occupied by TusA and IscU when bound to IscS. Furthermore, three-way pull-down experiments demonstrated that IscS may bind either TusA or IscU individually, but not both at the same time (Shi et al, 2010) . To further explore the possibility that thiolation of tRNA Lys (UUU) is affected by competition between TusA and IscU for sulfur transfer from IscS, we constructed a mathematical model of IscU and TusA binding to IscS ( Figure 6A ). Our model consisted of a set of equilibrium and mass conservation relationships. In this case, the model parameters had either been previously measured or were not difficult to estimate based on existing data (Urbina et al, 2001; Taniguchi et al, 2010) . Our model predicts the relative amount of U34 thiolation from the TUS pathway for a specified amount of IscU.",

Our earlier model predicts the E. coli time course dynamics of lambda phage infection based on three parameters: the fraction of infections that are lytic instead of lysogenic, the rate of infection, and the burst size (how many functional progeny are released upon lysis). To integrate these two models, we related U34 thiolation (the output of the protein binding model) to the burst size (input for our infection model). We were thus able to explore the effect of changing the IscU or TusA concentration on the production of functional phage and the resulting infection time course. We first tested the integrated model's ability to predict the outcome of deleting iscU or tusA, and in both cases the model was able to capture the infection time course ( , as well as our experimental observation that the ratio of gpGT to gpG in the double mutant was similar to that observed in the DtusA strain, but not in the DiscU strain ( Figure 5C) .",

This hypothesis required some relatively simple modifications in the equations and parameters of our competitive binding model (Materials and methods). Our independent effect model was able to capture the results of tusA deletion, iscU deletion, and IscU titration as accurately as the competitive inhibition model (data not shown). However, the independent effect model was not able to predict the behavior of the double knockout strain ( Figure 6K ). Our competitive inhibition model predicts that the removal of IscU, one of TusA's primary competitors for sulfur, will cause an increase in the fraction of 2-thiolation modified U34 tRNA Lys (UUU) relative to BW25113. To directly measure the fraction of thiolated tRNA Lys (UUU), we performed an [(N-Acryloylamino)phenyl] mercuric chloride (APM) northern blot (Figure 7) , which specifically retards the migration of the thiolated tRNA fraction (Igloi, 1988) . We found a small fraction of hypomodified tRNA Lys in BW25113, and as predicted by the competitive inhibition model, loss of IscU in the DiscU strain decreased this fraction even further. We therefore conclude that our competitive inhibition model, but not our independent effect model, is sufficient to explain the effect of TUS and ISC pathway knockouts on lambda phage replication.",

TusA obtains sulfur from the cysteine desulfurase IscS, and passes it along the TUS pathway for eventual modification of tRNA Lys (UUU) at U34. The fraction of tRNA Lys (UUU) that undergoes this modification influences the frequency of PRF in lambda phage due to its role in decoding part of the slippery sequence within its GT region. Although lambda phage requires both gpG and gpGT for normal replication, the gpG:gpGT ratio must be kept high. Deletion of any member of the TUS pathway prevents modification of tRNA Lys (UUU), and subsequently increases frameshifting, both decreasing the gpG:gpGT ratio and lambda phage production.",

When IscU, HscA, HscB, or IscA is removed from the system, TusA obtains more sulfur than normal, leading to hypermodification of tRNA Lys (UUU), a decrease in frameshifting, and increases in the gpG:gpGT ratio and lambda phage production. Previous investigations in B. subtilis reported that disrupting the function of IscU affects several levels of tRNA modifications, including an increase in 2-thiolation of U34 ; our observations suggest that in the case of tRNA Lys (UUU), this effect is a result of an increase of sulfur flux through the TUS pathway ( Figures 5C, 6K, and 7) . Removal of the transcriptional repressor IscR leads to an increase in protein production from the ISC operon (Schwartz et al, 2001) , reducing the amount of sulfur available to TusA. This competition effect depends on an intact TUS pathway, which is why the DtusADiscU deletion mutant expresses a phenotype similar to the DtusA strain.",

However, the DthiI strain exhibited decreased lambda replication, albeit somewhat less strongly than the TUS pathway deletion strains. One clue to this mystery may reside with the CyaY protein, which is thought to be an iron donor for Fe-S cluster assembly, forming a ternary complex with IscU and IscS (Shi et al, 2010) . The binding site for ThiI on IscS overlaps substantially with CyaY (Shi et al, 2010) , and it is conceivable that in the absence of ThiI, CyaY is able to interact more efficiently with IscU, either stabilizing the IscS-IscU-CyaY complex or assisting sulfur transfer to IscU.

Arabinose induction was performed for 2 h at 0.2, 0.02, and 0.002% arabinose, after which the samples were spun down in a table-top centrifuge at B20 000 g for 30 s. The media was aspirated and the pellets were frozen at \u00c0801C. The samples were run on a 12% SDS-PAGE gel for 1.5 h at 80 V in Tris/glycine/SDS buffer. The protein was transferred onto a polyvinylidene fluoride membrane for 1 h at 100 V at room temperature. The membrane was washed for 30 s in TBST, then blocked with 5% milk blocking buffer for 1 h. The primary antibody (Anti-express antibody, Invitrogen) was diluted 1:5000 and incubated with the membrane blot overnight at 41C. The membrane was washed five times for 10 min with TBST, followed by a 1-h incubation with a 1:5000 dilution of the secondary antibody (goat anti-mouse IgG horseradish peroxidase). The membrane was washed five times for 5 min with TBST. Luminol reagent was used for chemiluminescence imaging (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, sc2048).",

One gel contained 200 ml of 1 mg/ml APM (kindly supplied by Gabor Igloi) for 10 ml of gel. The gels were prerun for 30 min at 180 V in 0.5 \u00c2 TBE. Approximately 2.5 mg of RNA (for each well) was then mixed with 2 \u00c2 loading buffer and heated to 651C for 3 min before being cooled on ice for 1 min. The gels were run for B45 min at 180 V. The RNA was transferred onto a nylon membrane using a semi-dry system for 1 h at 250 mA. The transfer buffer contained 0.5 \u00c2 TBE supplemented with 10 mM b-mercaptoethanol. The RNA was then UV crosslinked to the nylon membrane. T4 Polynucleotide Kinase (PNK) was used to radiolabel 25 pmol of 32 P ATP to 25 pmol of tRNA Lys (UUU) oligonucleotide probe for each blot. The oligonucleotide sequence used to probe tRNA Lys (UUU) was 5 0 -TGGGTCGTGCAGGATTCGAA-3 0 . Qiagen's Qiaquick Nucleotide Exchange Kit was used to remove free 32 P ATP. The blots were incubated in 25 ml of prehybridization buffer (10 \u00c2 Denhardt's, 6 \u00c2 SSC, 0.1% SDS) at 421C for 1 h. The labeled probe was heated to 951C for 2-3 min before being added to the prehybridaztion buffer. The blots were hybridized at 421C overnight. The next day, the blots were washed with high salt buffer (5 \u00c2 SSC, 0.1% SDS) at 371C for 20 min twice, followed by two washes with low salt buffer (1 \u00c2 SSC, 0.1% SDS) at 421C for 20 min. After the final wash, the blots were exposed to a phosphorscreen for 10 min.",

Approximating the E. coli volume as 10 \u00c015 L, we obtained concentrations of 1.37 and 0.77 mM for IscS and IscU, respectively. Since TusA amounts were not reported, we estimated its concentration to be similar to but less than IscU 0.5 mM. An in-vitro study reported the K d values of IscS and IscU to be 2 mM, and the k cat (k 2 in the above equations) to be 8.5 per minute (Urbina et al, 2001) . IscU displaced TusA in a three-way pull-down assay (Shi et al, 2010) , from which we hypothesized that the K d of TusA-IscU was 20% more than that of IscU-IscS. The cysteine concentration was chosen to be equal to the IscS concentration. The forward rates of reaction were assigned as follows: k 1 \u00bck 3 \u00bck 5 \u00bck 7 \u00bck 8 \u00bc10 5 , k 4 \u00bck 6 \u00bck \u00c03 . The reverse reaction rates were obtained by multiplying the corresponding forward rate by the appropriate dissociation constant. Gene deletion conditions were simulated by setting the pertinent concentration values to zero. IscU titrations were modeled by setting its concentration to 50, 100, and 150% of the WT amount.",
