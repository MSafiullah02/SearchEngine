This increase in coding density depends on overlapping genes, in which two different reading frames on the same strand are translated to yield two proteins (Normark et al., 1983). Overlapping genes originate by a mechanism of overprinting, in which critical nucleotide substitutions in a pre-existing ancestral frame induce the expression of a de novo protein from an alternative frame (Keese and Gibbs, 1992; Rancurel et al., 2009; Sabath et al., 2012). The de novo proteins, unlike the ancestral ones, usually lack any remote homologs in protein databases (Gibbs and Keese, 1995).",

Interestingly, it has been found that some human cancer-specific antigens, silent in normal tissues, are translated from alternative open reading frames (AltORFs) (Wang et al., 1996, 1998; Rosenberg et al., 2002; Mandic et al., 2003; Slager et al., 2003).

The gene-novelty theory asserts that the birth of de novo proteins, often overprinting a structural or enzymatic protein, is driven by selection pressures providing the virus with a fitness advantage that lead to their fixation (Keese and Gibbs, 1992; Rancurel et al., 2009; Brandes and Linial, 2016).",

A well-known example is the apoptin of Chicken anemia virus, which induces cell death in a broad range of human tumour cell lines but not in normal cells (Danen-Van Oorschot et al., 1997; Backendorf et al., 2008; reviewed by Castro et al., 2018). Another example is the X protein of Borna disease virus, which shows protective properties against neurodegeneration in vitro and in vivo (Szelechowski et al., 2014). To increase their therapeutic effectiveness, researchers have constructed N-terminal deleted forms or short peptides both for apoptin (Shen Ni et al., 2013; Ruiz-Mart\u00ednez et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2017) and X protein (Szelechowski et al., 2014; Ferr\u00e9 et al., 2016).",

The input data were collected into a matrix of 556 rows (312 overlapping and 244 non-overlapping genes) and 37 columns (the critical composition features I detected). The matrix was enlarged with a \u201cdummy variable\u201d having a value of -1 for overlapping genes and +1 for non-overlapping genes (38th column). This variable was the \u201coutcome\u201d variable on the Y-axis, while the 37 critical composition features were the \u201cpredictor\u201d variables on the X-axes. PLS-DA first calculated a, the intercept on the Y-axis, and b, the regression coefficient for each X-axis. Using this linear regression function, I predicted Y and evaluated the accuracy of prediction. It was given by the number of overlapping genes with a predicted Y value below 0 added to the number of non-overlapping genes with a predicted Y value above 0. The sum was divided by the total number of observations (556) and multiplied by 100.",

(2012) found that young de novo genes have a codon usage highly different from the rest of the genome and that older de novo genes tend to have a codon usage more adapted to that of the rest of the genome. Based on this finding, I can infer that the non-structural protein NSs of orthohantaviruses is encoded by a young de novo gene and that the secreted glycoprotein (SGP) of ebolaviruses by an older de novo gene. Table S1 reports several overlaps with a codon-usage statistics similar to that found in orthohantaviruses (e.g. overlaps #6 and #24) or to that found in ebolaviruses (e.g. overlaps #9 and #44). This information should be useful for inferring the relative age of other overlapping genes.",

            "text": "In the present study, a multivariate statistical analysis of a large dataset revealed new evolutionary features of viral overlapping genes. They show a common, and peculiar, pattern of nucleotide and amino acid composition. Thanks to discriminant analysis, overlapping genes can be separated from non-overlapping genes with high accuracy. Thus, the model I developed is a valuable tool for identifying new potential dual-coding regions in the viral genome sequences deposited in databases and, possibly, also in the eukaryotic genome sequences. A preliminary application of the model to SARS-CoV-2 led to prediction of 2 putative overlaps in the 3\u2019 genome region. The finding that the proteins encoded by the de novo frames differ significantly from those encoded by the ancestral frames supports the view that overprinting is a valuable source of genetic novelties. This view is corroborated by the notion that 2 de novo proteins (apoptin from CAV and X protein from BDV) can exert functions that are not virus-specific, such as a selective anticancer toxicity in human tumour cell lines and a protection against neurodegeneration in tissue culture, respectively. The search for variants of these proteins with an enhanced therapeutic effectiveness is an intriguing field of research. The contribution provided by this study could be helpful for future experimental studies. Finally, the wide collection of processed genome sequences given in Supplementary Files can be used by others as reference datasets for subsequent evolutionary studies (e.g. the relative age of overlapping genes or the occurrence of symmetric and asymmetric evolution in different regions of the same overlap).",
