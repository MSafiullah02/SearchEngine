These studies used data from China and its provinces, other Asian countries such as Japan, Korea, the Philippines, and countries from other parts of the world such as Nigeria, Iran, Italy, Europe as a whole, France, Latin America, Turkey, the United Kingdom (UK), and the United States of America (USA). These selected articles gave an output of 30 counts of R0 and 29 counts of CFR which were used in a meta-analysis. A meta-analysis, with the inverse variance method, fixed-and random-effects model and the Forest plot, was performed to estimate the mean effect size or mean value of basic reproduction rate and case fatality rate.

            "text": "The outbreak and spread of novel coronavirus-2019, particularly identified as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China, was first time reported to World Health Organisation (WHO) on 31 December 2019. On 7 January 2020, it was confirmed by Chinese authorities, and on 12 January 2020, WHO confirmed it. The epidemics of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Acute Respiratory Syndrome (MARS) in the past and the recent outbreaks of infectious diseases like Ebola and H1N1 influenza make us conscientious about comprehending the spread of such viruses and consequences regarding life losses, morbidity, economic burden, and political instability. It is utmost crucial to control the spread and outbreak at the very first case of the disease. It is highly transmittable zoonotic coronavirus disease. The first step for academicians and any government agencies, beforehand, is to study the basic reproduction rate (R0) which is the average number of secondary infectious cases produced by an infectious case, that provides the plausibility of the spread, outbreak, and severity of an epidemic in a short time available to them. The value of R0 greater than one indicates the number of infectious persons is likely to increase and the value of R0 less than one indicates the transmission is likely to die out. R0 determines the potential for an epidemic spread in a susceptible population in the absence of specific control measures (Koff, 1992; World Health Organization, 2003) . For understanding the transmissibility of SARS-CoV-2 in population, every country had made efforts for estimating the R0. Numerous studies have shown that recovery rate has remained more or less the same, but reproduction rate and case fatality rate (CFR) varied across the regions (Fanelli and Piazza 2020, p. 4). The case fatality rate is defined as the percentage of individuals with symptomatic or confirmed diseases who die from the disease. The case fatality rate is currently in the range of 2-8 per cent but has varied across the age groupshigher at old ages and lower at child and adult ages. The estimates of CFR based on hospital records lies in the range of 8-28 per cent (Verity et al. 2020, p. 2) . These estimates are evidence to the severity of coronavirus in a short time of its outbreak.",

Since the incidence of new cases of SARS-CoV-2, the R0 is crucial to understand the mechanism as well as the implementation strategies to reach an effective value of Rt which should be less than one for containing the outbreak. The epidemic is considered to be under control when Rt is less than one. The CFR is quite easily measurable and less sensitive to censoring and bias compared to R0. The moments of the distribution of death and mortality patterns are most useful for calculating adjusted CFR; however, R0 is quite sensitive to the onset of diseases and the number of days to get a prediction. In other cases, it is Rt which is time-variant and mathematically, a limiting case of R0. Nevertheless, R0 is the most warranted statistics of the epidemiological model for This study aims to provide, from a systematic review and a meta-analysis, a summary statistic of R0 and CFR which has the best applicability for other regions or countries as well as the lower level of geography districts and towns/village at the point of the onset of disease in a susceptible population. This summary statistics of R0 and CFR would be of immense utility to government authorities for the practical implementation of strategies or control measures at the very initial phase of the COVID-19 disease transmission.",

We intend to look for articles in which reproduction number/rate or case fatality rate is estimated or calculated using some methods or methodology. Making our search more extensive, for reproduction number/rate, we searched on the basis of terms 'coronavirus reproduction estimation' in All Fields AND 'COVID-19' in the field Title/Abstract. This search in PubMed MEDLINE gives output for 29 articles to explore the parameter estimates of reproduction rates as well as the methodologies and epidemiological models. We reviewed title, keywords, abstracts and data and methods or methods/methodology, and references in these articles. We found three research articles which were based on a descriptive systematic review or general discussion focused on reproduction rates.

The high value of 99.9% I 2 statistic confirms that these studies did not stem from the same population. The other two statistics which are tau-squared (\uf074 2 ) statistic, the between-study variance in a meta-analysis, and Cochran's Q-statistic, the difference between the observed effect sizes and fixed-effects model, are significant for R0 as well as for CFR (Table 3) . These tests of heterogeneity were quite important for deciding the application of fixed-effects or random-effects models for a meta-analysis. The fixed-effects model assumes that the studies stem from the same population .

A minimum sample of three studies is required for performing a subgroup analysis in a meta-analysis.

Figure 1 and Figure 2 show Forest plot showing mean effect sizes by regional subgroups for R0 and CFR, respectively, along with the overall effect size, based on the random-effects model. The mean R0 values for the regional subgroup 'China and its provinces' was 3.21 (2.73-3.68) persons, and for 'other Asian countries' was 1.90 (1.06-2.74) persons and for 'other countries' was 3.83 (2.44-5.22) persons ( Table 6 ). The test of regional subgroup differences using random-effects model is significant with a p-value of 0.013. This confirms that the estimated mean R0 values are significantly different across these regions. The results revealed that, among these regions, it is the highest for the subgroup 'other countries', wherein it is the highest for the USA. The regional subgroups identified for CFR meta-analysis are 'China and its provinces', 'other Asian countries' that includes study based on data from Japan, South Korea, and the Philippines, and 'other countries' that includes studies based on data from Europe, France, Latin America, Turkey, the United Kingdom (UK), and the USA. The mean CFR values for 'China and its provinces' was 2.53 (1.91-3.14) per cent, for 'other Asian countries' was 2.56 (-0.26-5.38) per cent, and for 'other countries' was 2.78 (2.08-3.47) per cent ( Table 7) . The test for regional subgroup differences using the random-effects model was not significant (p=0.865). Hence, it implies that the CFR did not vary significantly across these regions despite the fact that the CFR was the highest in the USA and the lowest in South Korea.",

After an electronic search for such conditions between the dates 15 December 2019 and 3 May 2020 and applying various inclusion and exclusion criteria, this study came across 24 and 17 works of literature for R0 and CFR, respectively that qualified for a meta-analysis. These studies provided 30 counts of R0 and 29 counts of CFR for a meta-analysis. The study examined the characteristics of studies and computed the overall effect size or mean R0 and CFR value. We applied the test of heterogeneity which are Higgin's & Thompson's I 2 statistic, tau-squared (\uf074 2 ) statistic, and Cochran's Q-statistic. These test of heterogeneity reveals a high heterogeneity across the studies. The studies included in the meta-analysis had the sources of errors not only from sampling errors but also from the distributions of individual mean effect size. The R0 and CFR values extracted from different studies had their own distributions that were different from an overarching distribution. Therefore, the random-effects model was most appropriate for computing mean R0 value and mean CFR value based on a meta-analysis. After excluding outliers, the estimate of R0 and CFR from these studies was calculated at 3.11 (2.49-3.71) persons (Table 4 : column (f)) and 2.63 (2.18-3.08) per cent (Table 5 : column (f)), respectively, based on the random-effects model. For R0, the variation by subgroups of regions was significant. It reveals that the R0 values were significantly different across these regional subgroups. However, the regional subgroups differences for CFR was not a significant one. Hence, we conclude that the CFR did not vary across the regions.",

This R0 statistic implies that one infectious person is transmitting to three other susceptible persons in the absence of any control measures. The R0 value is overall effect size based on various heterogeneous studies. Therefore, this R0 value is most reasonable and sensible for a country or a region encountering the emergence of COVID-19 during the first phase or in the very initial stage of this infectious disease. The meta-analysis by regional subgroups reveals the variation in R0 across the regions (Table 6 ). Therefore, this study suggests that R0 values based on a meta-analysis from the pieces of evidence across the regions would range between 1.90 (1.06-2.73) person and 3.83 (2.33-5.21) persons. The CFR statistic is based on the period of approximately one-and-a-half months, but it translates to toll deaths in a short span of time. The results of regional subgroup analysis in meta-analysis confirm that the CFR did not vary across the regions. The estimated CFR value of 2.63 per cent (Table 7) without much variation is applicable to any generalised population. For a developing country like India and the second most populated country in the world, the CFR value of 2.63 is most dreadful.

The period for analysis for COVID-19 is more than three months from 15 December 2019 to 3 May 2020. We retrieved studies which are peer-reviewed research papers and are mostly from the regions which have encountered the epidemic in an area or pandemic in a country or nation at the very early emergence of SARS-CoV-2. Many of these peer-reviewed studies have used data mainly from China and its provinces. Some of these studies had analysed data from other Asian countries and a few from other parts of the world. Therefore, a wide and rich regional view of data was not available in the period of study. Most of these studies in itself have the disadvantage of small sample size and missing information on the time of onset of SARS-CoV-2. Accordingly, the authors of these selected published papers have used generalised epidemiological models to get robust estimates. Most of these have used time-varying models using simulation methods and the moments of statistical distributions for estimating parameters of the epidemiological models. We also, in order to overcome such limitations of small sample size, have estimated the mean R0 and CFR values using the random-effects model which make the estimation of parameter based on the assumption that these studies stem from a universe of population. Therefore, the estimates of R0 and CFR in this study is robust and applicable to a generalised population. In addition to that, nonetheless, the Funnel plot for both R0 and CFR showed that these publications are important to consider for a meta-analysis, as these studies are found statistically significant for examining COVID-19. is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.",
