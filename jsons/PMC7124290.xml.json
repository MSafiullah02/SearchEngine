Another problem frequently encountered is that in bacterial infections, antibiotics are frequently used without regard to an understanding of their efficacy against the typical bacterial causes of ABRS. Little logic exists when a patient with ABRS is first prescribed TMP/SMX, then is switched to cefaclor when symptoms do not improve, and subsequently is prescribed azithromycin when again there is still no improvement. No agent in this example provides adequate empirical treatment for S pneumoniae or H influenzae, both major bacterial pathogens in ABRS.",

Rather than just create a list of antibiotics, numerous factors (eg, microbiology of ABRS, pharmacodynamic/pharmacokinetic principles, features of common oral antibiotics, the resistance mechanisms of bacterial pathogens, and the results of surveillance studies focused on prevalence of resistant pathogens) assisting in the selection of antimicrobial agents are discussed. All this information, in conjunction with a mathematical model for analyzing treatment outcomes, leads to the development of rational treatment guidelines that will assist clinicians in providing optimal treatment for their patients.",

Human rhinovirus and coronavirus do not cause major epithelial damage, but influenza virus and adenovirus do damage the nasal epithelium.13, 14 Most of these infections occur in the early fall to early spring seasons.

Contrary to popular belief, a change in the color or the characteristic of the nasal discharge is not a specific sign of a bacterial infection.22, 23, 24, 25, 26 After a few days of a viral infection, mucopurulent nasal secretions may occur because of an influx of neutrophils. The point at which a viral URI becomes superinfected with pathogenic bacteria can only be determined with repeated sinus aspiration studies. Sinus aspiration studies in adults demonstrate significant bacterial growth in approximately 60% of patients with URI symptoms lasting at least 10 days.27 The risk that bacterial superinfection has occurred is greater if the illness is no better or worse after 10 days. Because there may be cases that fall out of the \u201cnorm\u201d of this typical progression and have specific findings suggesting bacterial infection (fever, facial erythema, swelling, and severe pain), practicing clinicians need to rely on clinical judgment when using these guidelines. In general, however, a diagnosis of ABRS may be made in adults or children with a viral URI that is no better after 10 days or worsens after 5 to 7 days and is accompanied by some or all of the following symptoms: nasal drainage, nasal congestion, facial pressure/pain (especially when unilateral and focused in the region of a particular sinus), postnasal drainage, hyposmia/anosmia, fever, cough, fatigue, maxillary dental pain, and ear pressure/fullness (Table 1).\n\n",

Because the environmental conditions at the site of infection rarely correspond to in vitro susceptibility test conditions, effects of elements such as oxygen tension, pH, and protein binding on the activity of the antimicrobial of interest need to be considered. For example, low pH can have a significantly detrimental effect on the activity of the macrolides. Therefore, even if an organism appears susceptible in vitro, clinical failure may occur if in vivo conditions detract from the activity of the drug. Similarly, some host factors may actually serve to improve the in vivo activity of an antimicrobial. Macrophages, opsonic factors, and complement may all act synergistically with an antibiotic and thus provide enhanced antibacterial activity over that which would be predicted in vitro.

With S pneumoniae, for instance, an initial alteration in the parC gene that encodes for topoisomerase IV results in low-level quinolone resistance. A second mutation at the gyrA gene encoding for the Gyr A subunit of DNA gyrase results in the expression of high-level quinolone resistance. Although cross-resistance commonly occurs among the fluoroquinolones, the newest agents often remain active against strains that have become resistant to older agents. The different fluoroquinolones likely target and interact with different regions of the DNA gyrase and topoisomerase molecules because a variety of mutations in the genes encoding the 2 enzymes can confer fluoroquinolone resistance.",

These barriers, which include the inner membrane, cell wall, and outer membrane (gram-negative bacteria), help the cell to regulate flow of substances. Lipophilic substances are capable of passive diffusion across these membranes; however, passage of hydrophilic materials may be facilitated by water-filled porin channels. Porins are one mechanism by which antimicrobials may traverse the hydrophobic barriers. Antimicrobials may also enter the cell through protein-mediated transport. If a change occurs in either the number or configuration of porin channels or transport proteins, the ability of an antimicrobial to reach its active site may be greatly reduced. Another structural change that can significantly reduce the concentration of antibiotic at the target site is the activation of antimicrobial efflux pumps. This is an important mechanism of resistance regulated by the activation of energy-dependent proteins that actively pump antimicrobials out of the cell.",

There are two important genes responsible for macrolide resistance: erm (a ribosomal methylase) and mef (a macrolide-specific efflux mechanism). Among isolates of S pneumoniae , resistance results most frequently from target site modification (methylation) and altered efflux pumps (mef ).52, 53 The efflux mechanism confers a more moderate degree of resistance compared with the high level of resistance seen in strains possessing the methylase mechanism. The efflux mechanism is generally more common in the United States and relatively uncommon in most other parts of the world. Ribosomal methylase mediated but not efflux macrolide resistance confers cross-resistance to clindamycin. Macrolide use is therefore the most likely cause of the measurable increase in S pneumoniae resistance to macrolides and to clindamycin.",

The US component of the 1998 Alexander Project demonstrated that 16.1% and 28.6% of the S pneumoniae isolates were penicillin-intermediate and penicillin-resistant, respectively.56 The prevalence of penicillin resistance was significantly higher in middle ear and sinus isolates than in strains recovered from other sites. A 1998 CDC surveillance study of invasive (ie, blood or cerebrospinal fluid) S pneumoniae isolates from hospitals and clinical laboratories demonstrated that 10.5% and 13.9% of the isolates were penicillin-intermediate and penicillin-resistant, respectively.57, 58 The disparity in the prevalence of penicillin nonsusceptible S pneumoniae isolates in these studies may be related to the isolates from the US component of the 1998 Alexander Project being more likely to originate from patients not responding to treatment.

Activity is limited by its destruction by the \u03b2-lactamases produced by some strains of H influenzae, M catarrhalis, Staphylococcus , and gram-negative oral anaerobic species. Given its intrinsic activity and excellent bioavailability, amoxicillin is generally considered the most active of all the oral \u03b2-lactams against streptococci, including pneumococci. Resistance to penicillin in isolates of S pneumoniae is relative and may be overcome in most cases by using higher doses of amoxicillin. Although the typical adult amoxicillin dose is 1.5 to 1.75 g/day and the typical pediatric amoxicillin dose is 40 to 45 mg/kg per day, 2 to 3 times higher daily doses may be necessary to eradicate isolates of S pneumoniae .

For an antimicrobial with a 68-hour half-life (eg, azithromycin), total elimination from the body does not occur for 5 to 7 half-lives, or 14 to 20 days.

In fact, in most fluoroquinolone dose fractionation studies, the AUC/MIC ratio has a better correlation with efficacy than peak to MIC ratio. Data obtained from several sources, including animal models of sepsis, in vitro pharmacodynamic experiments, and clinical outcome studies, indicate that the magnitude of the AUC/MIC ratio can be used to predict response. Forrest et al82 demonstrated that an AUC/MIC ratio of \u2265125 was associated with the highest bacterial eradication rates in the treatment of infections caused by gram-negative enteric pathogens. However, for gram-positive bacteria, it appears that effective AUC/MIC ratios can be appreciably lower. For instance, against S pneumoniae an in vitro model of infection demonstrated that for levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin an AUC/MIC ratio of approximately 30 was associated with a 4-log reduction in bacterial titers; whereas ratios less than 30 were associated with significantly reduced rates of bacterial killing and in some instances bacterial regrowth.83 Similarly, Lister and Sanders84 reported that for levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin an AUC to MIC ratio of 32 to 44 was associated with maximal eradication of S pneumoniae in an in vitro model of infection. These observations are supported by data from nonneutropenic animal models of infection in which survival was associated with an AUC/MIC ratio of 25 to 30 against the pneumococcus.85\n",

In Monte Carlo simulation, prior knowledge is used about the handling of a drug in a population of patients. This can be done by using the mean values for the pharmacokinetic parameters and also providing the covariance matrix for the parameters. The covariance matrix provides information about the variability of the pharmacokinetic parameters in the population and how they covary with one another. A Monte Carlo simulation program randomly samples from the population of patients described by the mean parameters and the covariance matrix. The program can be directed to perform the sampling a large number of times (eg, 1000 to 10,000 times). In this way, a population of simulated patients can be created. By using a large number of simulated patients, an accurate estimate can be developed of how often a patient whose plasma clearance is 2 L/h (AUC = 250 for a 500-mg dose of levofloxacin) will be encountered and how often a subject with a plasma clearance of 17 L/h (AUC approximately 30 for a 500-mg dose) will be encountered. At each value of the MIC, it is possible to determine how frequently the therapeutic target for the simulated population of patients is attained.

The pathogen distribution in children used was 42% for S pneumoniae , 20% for H influenzae , and 20% for M catarrhalis . Because S pneumoniae is the more pathogenic bacterial organism, the model incorporates a higher prevalence of S pneumoniae in children to ensure appropriate antimicrobial coverage. For each of the major pathogens, the spontaneous resolution rate was estimated from published data in which placebo was used in otitis media. The values used in this model were 30% for S pneumoniae , 60% for H influenzae , 80% for M catarrhalis, and 50% for other pathogens. Based on these values, spontaneous resolution is predicted to occur in 46.6% of adults with ABRS (28% of the total patient group). Therefore spontaneous resolution will occur in 63% of the untreated adult group (28% with infection plus 35% without infection). Of the 37% adult patients whose symptoms do not resolve if untreated, 5% are uninfected and will not respond because of non-microbiologically related factors, whereas 32% will not respond because of untreated bacterial infection. However, if a drug with 100% bacteriologic efficacy were to be used, the disease will theoretically resolve in all of the adult patients in the infected group and in 95% of all adult patients. Thus the theoretical disease resolution rates in the adults in this model, depending on efficacy of treatment, can vary from 46.6% (the rate from spontaneous resolution) to 100% (for patients treated with an antimicrobial with 100% bacterial efficacy). For the total adult group, these limits vary from 63% (untreated) to 95% (using agent with 100% efficacy). On the other hand, spontaneous resolution will occur in 49.6% of untreated children in the bacterially infected group and 64.8% of the untreated total pediatric patient group. Importantly, the individual values of the various parameters are estimates. Interested investigators could change any value and use the model to calculate the resulting effect on bacteriologic and clinical outcome.",

Agents with poor activity against all pathogens will result in resolution rates similar to the spontaneous resolution seen in the untreated group, whereas agents active against all pathogens will result in higher resolution rates. Resolution rates for the bacterially infected group and the total patient group (using the mean susceptibility data from the US component of the 1998 Alexander Project, the 1998 SENTRY Surveillance Report, and the 1998 CDC Active Bacterial Core Surveillance Report) are shown in Marchant plots (Figures 12 and 13).56, 58, 95\n\nThese datasets were used because complete MIC distributions were available and the proportion of isolates inhibited at PK/PD breakpoints could be determined. The outcomes of these calculations are shown as Marchant plots showing predicted bacteriologic outcomes in the bacterial infection group and the total patient group. The Marchant plot is only a relative rank order for the data used. Other surveillance data may therefore alter this relative rank order. These resolution rates are based on in vitro microbiologic efficacy and do not guarantee clinical outcome. However, in the absence of microbiologic outcome data from clinical studies for most agents, this model was used as the best method available for predicting clinical outcome.",
