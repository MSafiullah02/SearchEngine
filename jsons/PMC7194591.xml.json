Previous studies have described the spatial spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in Beijing and mainland China (Meng et al., 2005, Fang et al., 2009). One study also considered the different types of connections between cities to calculate the spatial association (Meng et al., 2005). Other studies have analyzed the epidemic data of the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in Saudi Arabia using various spatial approaches (Adegboye et al., 2017; Lin et al., 2018; Al-Ahmadi et al., 2019).",

In this case, the centroid for each province was determined using the gCentroid function in the rgeos package of statistical software R (Bivand et al., 2019). Thined as the Euclidean distance between the centroids of these provinces. The extent to which the two provinces were adjacent was defined as the inverse of the distance. In Models 1 and 2, spatial adjacency was defined by geographical information, which is the usual method for examining spatial relationships. As COVID-19 is spread from person to person, population and population density were the key foci. Thus, Models 3 and 4 considered population and population density. The population (population density) for each province was ranked. A province was defined as adjacent to both the previous and following ranked provinces. Thus, the first-ranked and last-ranked provinces only had one adjacent neighbour. In terms of medical care resources, Models 5 and 6 considered the number of doctors and hospitals or medical centre beds. The definition of an adjacent neighbour was the same as that in Models 3 and 4. Moran\u2019s I function was used in the ape package of the statistical software R (Paradis et al., 2019).

Except for the medical centre bed-based neighbourhood, a spatial clustering tendency was observed in every neighbourhood type from approximately 22 January. The regions connected by express trains to Wuhan \u2013 such as Shenzhen, Shanghai and Beijing \u2013 had five, two and two confirmed cases, respectively on 21 January, the early stage of COVID-19 in China. This implies the possibility that COVID-19 had spread from Wuhan to other areas via the transportation (Zhao et al., 2020). This possibility also supports the spatial dependency we detected in this study. On 23 January, the Chinese government closed off Wuhan City to prevent the spread of COVID-19. These findings could link with such a government policy. The results of the evaluation using geographical and distance-based neighbourhoods showed that COVID-19 is highly likely to spread between geographically adjacent regions. This may be because people in adjacent regions tend to interact with each other. In addition, Moran\u2019s I using population-based neighbourhoods also showed a strong spatial association. More people are likely to be infected with the virus in densely populated regions, which leads to the active spread of COVID-19 to other areas. Finally, having many doctors in a region indicates that the region can accommodate many severely ill patients, which can lead to the spread of the virus. This result is consistent with that of a previous study (Meng et al., 2005).",

First, it used the reported dataset for the daily number of newly confirmed cases in the 31 provinces of China. This did not include the number of suspected cases, so it was difficult to understand the spatio-temporal transmission of COVID-19. However, it was important to investigate the spatial and temporal characteristics of the COVID-19 outbreak at an early stage. Second, it considered six types of neighbourhoods; other types of neighbourhoods were not covered in this study, such as the urban-rural relationship, which might have also been significant (Meng et al., 2005). Third, it only investigated spatial spread in mainland China. As infections have also occurred in other countries, investigating the global spatial spread of COVID-19 might be important to manage COVID-19.",
