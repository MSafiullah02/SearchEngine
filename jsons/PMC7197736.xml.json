The incidence of paralytic poliomyelitis has been reduced over the last decades, especially by the systematic use of vaccines; however, this disease is still endemic in Asia and Africa (Felipe et al. 2006). Because of its replication in several types of cultured cells, PV is one of the most studied and understood viral models (Faccin et al. 2007).",
