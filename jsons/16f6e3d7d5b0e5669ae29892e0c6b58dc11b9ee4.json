Nasal mucosa was obtained surgically from the inferior turbinate. Urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA) specific staining was observed in pseudostratified ciliated epithelium and was predominant in mucous cells of the seromucinous gland, while serous cells were almost devoid of stain. The pattern of staining of plasminogen activator inhibitor-2 was similar to that of u-PA. In contrast, plasminogen activator inhibitor-1(PAI-1) immunoreactive material was localized exclusively in serous cells of seromucinous glands. Positive staining for tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) was observed in endothelial cells and basal cells, which differentiate into either ciliated or goblet cells. Nasal secretions were partially fractionated by immunospecific antibodyimmobilized Sepharose. Subsequent fibrin autography patterns indicated the presence of u-PA, PAI-1, and t-PA. After methacholine provocation, the level of t-PA increased transiently but decreased rapidly with subsequent challenges. These differential stainings of fibrinolytic components and the existence of PAs and PAI-1 in the nasal discharge suggest that the fibrinolytic system may play a role in the movement and fluidity of nasal secretion.& b d y :",

            "text": "The fibrinolytic system plays an important role not only in degradation of fibrin clots but also in a variety of bio-logical processes occurring in various human tissues, such as neovascularization, wound healing, ovulation, tumor invasion, and inflammation (Danf et al. 1985; Loskutoff et al. 1989; Carmeliet and Collen 1995) . Whereas tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) is involved primarily in clot dissolution, urokinase-type plasminogen activator (u-PA) has been implicated in pericellular proteolysis (Bugge et al. 1996a) . u-PA is involved in tissue remodeling not only by converting plasminogen to plasmin, which directly or indirectly degrades tissue proteins via metalloprotease activation, but also directly cleaves tissue proteins such as fibronectin (Glod et al. 1992) . Their action is controlled by plasminogen activator inhibitors (PAIs), of which PAI-1 appears to be the predominant physiological inhibitor of t-PA and u-PA. PAI-2, unable to inhibit t-PA as efficiently as PAI-1, is thought to be primarily a u-PA inhibitor (Kawano et al. 1968; Sprengers and Kluft 1987) .",

The staining pattern of both activators was granular in the cytoplasm and devoid in the nucleus. Since PA activity is regulated by PAIs, the tissue distribution of the inhibitors was of interest. There was no significant staining of PAI-1 in the epithelium ( Fig. 2A) . We observed a similar distribution of PAI-2 and u-PA in the epithelium (Figs. 1D, 2D ). There was no apparent difference in staining patterns between tissues from normal volunteers (one representative case is shown in Figs. 1, 2) and those from the patients with clinical disease.

The data shown is from normal volunteers and, again, no significant differences were observed between normal tissues and those obtained from patients with clinical disease. u-PA (Fig. 1E , F) and PAI-2 (Fig. 2E) were clearly localized in the mucinous cells, while almost no definitive localization was seen in the serous cells. In contrast, PAI-1 immunoreactive material was localized in the serous cells, whereas the mucinous cells were almost devoid of stain (Fig. 2B , C). t-PA immunoreactivity was not found in either mucinous or serous cells (Fig. 1C ), but positive staining was observed only in the vessel wall (Fig. 1B) . The immunohistochemistry results are summarized in Table 1 .",

As shown in Fig. 3A , both u-PA and t-PA activity was found in nasal secretion. In addition, almost all u-PA existed as the single-chain form because no fibrinolytic activity corresponding to a u-PA/ PAI-1 complex was observed in the fibrin autography (Fig. 3B, lane 1) . The fibrinolytic activity corresponding to a t-PA/PAI-1 complex (Fig. 3B, lane 2) was confirmed by removing this activity from the secretion with anti-PAI-1 Sepharose (data not shown). Although the mean PAI-1 level of purulent rhinosinusitis (15.1\u00b16.3 ng/ml, n=5) was higher than that of normal volunteers (3.1\u00b1 1.2 ng/ml, n=10), the absolute levels may vary considerably between individuals, because each secretion volume was different and the secretion from the normal volunteers was obtained after a methacholine provocation. However, although the size of the lytic zone was different, there was no apparent difference in the fibrin autography pattern between normal and patient secretions (Fig. 4) .",

However, their distribution and physiological roles in nasal tissues are not yet understood. In this study, two novel observations arose from the immunohistochemistry data. Firstly, the type of PA in the epithelial basal cells was different from that in the intermediate cells ( Fig. 1) and secondly, u-PA colocalized with PAI-2 in the mucinous cells in the lamina propria and in the epithelial cells (Figs. 1, 2) .

            "text": "Like amylase (Tachibana et al. 1986 ), PAI-1 was produced predominantly by the serous cells of the nasal glands. Although PAI-2 is currently thought to be primarily a u-PA inhibitor, PAI-1 can still inhibit both t-PA and u-PA almost 10-to 100-fold more efficiently (Sprengers and Kluft 1987; Loskutoff et al. 1989 ). In addition, PAI-1 and single-chain u-PA make a complex, although it easily dissociates during SDS-PAGE (Manchanda and Schwartz 1995) . u-PA is synthesized and secreted as a single-chain polypeptide and is involved mainly in the fibrinolytic process occurring in tissues (Carmeliet and Collen 1995) . The different localizations of PAI-1 (serous cells) and u-PA (mucinous cells) may contribute to a delayed inhibition of u-PA activity after secretion. It is also possible that PAI-2 is a primary inhibitor of u-PA in these tissues because of colocalization. Although further study is necessary, this selective localization of fibrinolytic components suggests a role for these proteins in maintaining normal nasal gland function. 454 Fig. 4A , B Fibrin autography analysis of fibrinolytic components in nasal secretion from patients.

Since methacholine enhances vascular permeability only slightly (Raphael et al. 1988) , and the level of t-PA in the secretion with the second provocation decreased significantly (Fig. 5) , it is unlikely that plasma t-PA was induced by methacholine. Furthermore, successive methacholine provocations did not induce either continuous secretion or depletion of fibrinolytic components from the gland or endothelial cells. Therefore, it is more likely that secretion of the fibrinolytic components was induced by some stimulus other than the methacholine, and they stayed in the duct as a constituent of the mucous blanket. Most probably, methacholine provocation simply increased the volume of the nasal discharge and washed out these fibrinolytic components from the duct and blanket.These components may play an important role in maintaining the fluidity of the nasal discharge. The production of the fibrinolytic components are regulated by several cytokines (Sadwey and Loskutoff 1991; Jensen and Rodeck 1993) . Inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-1, upregulate the production of PAI-1 as well as fibrinogen (Loskutoff et al.1989 ). This would decrease fibrinolytic activity in the nasal secretion and may contribute, at least in part, to the increased viscosity of the secretion in the case of infectious rhinosinusitis. & p . 2 : Acknowledgements This work is supported in part by Grant-inaid for Scientific Research number 09470234 to Y.S. from the Ministry of Education, Science, and Culture of Japan.",
