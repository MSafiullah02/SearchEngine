A group containing N-17-13 and N-30-12 mAbs reacted with N3 fragment, but not N4 fragment, and thus the mAbs recognized the region of amino acids 249\u2013317.

One study demonstrated that fragment N8 (amino acid residues 51\u2013422), N11 (133\u2013422), and N13 (221\u2013422) reacted with most of all tested 52 SARS patient sera [11]. The percentages of positive responses were 100%, 96%, and 100%, respectively. The results indicate that the C-terminus of N protein is highly immunogenic and is a good target for serological diagnosis. It is assumed that if a mAb can recognize N13 fragment that is similar to our N2 fragment, it will be valuable to be used in serological diagnosis. To achieve this purpose, two mAb clones (N-17-13 and S-39-2) showing the highest affinity to N protein were selected (Table 1). The mAbs recognized two different epitopes (amino acid residues 249\u2013317 and 317\u2013395, respectively) within N2 fragment (221\u2013422) (Table 2).",

The second is to detect viral antigen-specific antibodies, but the Abs are detected only after 10\u201314 days following SARS-CoV infection.

In contrast, SARS N protein is important for the viral RNA transcription and provides nuclear-import signal during SARS-CoV replication [15], [16].
