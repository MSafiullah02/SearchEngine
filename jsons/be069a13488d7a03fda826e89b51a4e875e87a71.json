One explanation may be patients' fear of coming to the hospital or disturbing busy caregivers, especially in case of atypical or mild STEMI clinical presentation. Other hypothetical reasons are reduced air pollution, better adherence to treatment, limited physical activity or absence of occupational stress during lockdown. Although all are possible it is difficult to see how they can account for the sudden and sharp drop observed in our multicenter cohort. A dramatic reduction in mortality from circulatory disease was observed during World War II [5] suggesting a possible temporary \"stunning\" or \"pause\" of some diseases in extraordinary situations such as war or a worldwide health crisis. Yet the missing STEMIs seem out of all reasonable proportion and the answer to the question \"where have the STEMIs gone\" will be difficult to elucidate.",
