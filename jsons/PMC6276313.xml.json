Under the unified leadership of the State Council, it established an epidemic reporting system. This allowed the central emergency leading group to obtain timely and accurate SARS epidemic information and to deal with the questions more effectively.[11] At the same time, prevention and control measures were released through the mass media, and the media began to widely report relevant epidemic prevention and control information. Communication pathways between the government and the public were established, and information collection was unobstructed outside the system, which led to improved control. Gradually, social order recovered and panic subsided.[12] This largely constructive change in the interaction between the center and localities helped China to bring SARS under control within 2 months.",

            "text": "The outbreak of H7N9 was regarded as a public health emergency event in China in 2013. As the isolation and treatment and medical observation of the close contacts are important measures to control and prevent the epidemic, isolating patients and tracking close contacts of cases were the most important tasks for all levels of government, hospitals, or CDCs. Epidemiological investigations of human cases of the avian influenza H7N9 virus showed that most patients had a history of recent exposure to poultry or a visit to a live poultry market.[15] This risk factor was established early in the epidemic, and hence an important measure was to close the live poultry trading markets. After the compulsory implementation of these shutdown measures, the spread of the virus was quickly controlled.[16] Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and other provinces closed their live poultry markets in a timely manner, which played a significant role in the control of the epidemic. After the epidemic spread to Guangdong and other provinces, the local governments enacted disinfection measures and closure of the live poultry markets, which further hindered the disease spread. Following Shanghai closing the city's live poultry market on April 6, the number of new cases declined rapidly and no new cases occurred after April 14. This coincided with the time when the rest of the nation was at the peak of the epidemic.",
