            "text": "Liver failure is a life-threatening syndrome with high mortality characterized by hepatocellular necrosis. This serious liver injury is caused by a variety of factors, such as viral infections, hepatotoxic drugs or immune-mediated attack. It can develop without antecedent liver diseases or from acute-on-chronic liver diseases. Liver failure may lead to disorders of synthesis, detoxification, excretion and biotransformation function or severe decompensation. This is a group of clinical syndromes, including coagulation disorders, jaundice, hepatic encephalopathy and ascites1. HLH is a rare clinical syndrome characterized by an uncontrolled and ineffective hyperinflammatory response2 with an all-cause mortality rate of 75% as reported in large series3. The clinical course of HLH usually progresses to \u201ccytokine storm\u201d due to uncontrolled macrophage activity and hypersecretion of cytokines4. Primary or familial HLH occurs most often in the pediatric age group, with approximately 50% of cases attributed to PFR1 gene mutations, resulting in deficient perforin5.",

Approximately 85% of adult patients had abnormal liver function7. Secondary HLH is associated with multiorgan failure, with high rates of morbidity and mortality8. Especially, acute liver failure caused by HLH has a high mortality9. However, the incidence of liver failure combined with HLH is extremely rare. The coexistence of two clinical conditions likely delays diagnosis, leading to rapid disease progression and substantially increased mortality. Although an optimal treatment of HLH is still being debated, the current treatment of HPS is mainly based on the HLH-2004 regimen10. Glucocorticoids play an important role in the treatment of liver failure with HLH, however, an optimal dose beneficial to control disease is worth exploring. Many gastroenterologists and hepatologists lack knowledge of and experience in early diagnosis and treatment of liver failure with HLH. Therefore, we retrospectively studied medical records of eleven patients diagnosed with liver failure and HLH, to demonstrate clinical and laboratory characteristics and to provide clues for early diagnosis and treatment of this fatal disease.",

            "text": "HLH, involved multiorgan and multisystem, exhibits progressive aggravation with immune and macrophage dysfunction. Liver failure is often combined with fever, infection, and coagulopathy. How to identify and diagnose HLH early during the treatment of liver failure are essential due to lack of specific clinical manifestations and laboratory findings. Our current knowledge of HLH focuses mainly on clinical aspects. The average time from earliest diagnosis of liver failure to a definitive diagnosis of HLH was 17.27 days in our study. This finding suggests that HLH occurs late in liver failure, specifically within 5 weeks after diagnosis of liver failure. Most of previous reports propose that acute liver failure is attributed to HLH-induced injury9,11. To date, detailed mechanisms for HLH-mediated liver injury remain unknown. Probably, infiltration of activated hemophagocytic histiocytes or overproduction of cytokines in HLH can cause damage to one organ or multiple organs, especially liver injury12. Alternatively, liver injury can result from underlying diseases. We retrospectively summarized 11 patients diagnosed with liver failure, who did not meet the criteria for diagnosis of HLH (HLH- 2004) on admission, but met the criteria during the course of treatment for liver failure. Based on dynamic changes in liver function, HLH mostly occurs in the middle and late stages, and even during recovery of liver failure,.as demonstrated by decreased bilirubin and INR (Table 2). Thus, HLH can occur during the treatment of liver failure, lag behind liver failure or develop during the recovery of liver failure.",

Therefore, HLH may be associated with complex infections and immune imbalances in liver failure, which is not a manifestation of HLH directly induced damage to organs. In particular, some patients were diagnosed with HLH in the recovery phase of liver failure. This result is similar to that reported by Elia Apodaca et al., indicating that HLH is not typically observed in the first days or even weeks. Rather, HLH is diagnosed at a later stage when the patients have already suffered from a number of complications and multiple-organ failure14.",

They were unresponsive to empiric or specific antibiotics at the time of HLH diagnosis; and 3 of 11 (36.36%) patients had no identifiable infectious sites. The presence of hemophagocytes in bone marrow, spleen or lymph nodes is one of the important conditions for HPS. Five (45.45%) patients did not exhibit hemophagocytes in early stage of the disease. Therefore, repeated bone marrow puncture biopsy is necessary in highly suspected cases. Hyperferritinemia is a hallmark of HLH.

Induction therapy occurs during the first to eight weeks, and the basic regimen involves dexamethasone, etoposide and cyclosporine. Then, maintenance therapy is administered for 9\u201340 weeks. Secondary HLH does not require maintenance therapy. Glucocorticoids is a first-line choice for liver failure with HLH, however, optimal dose beneficial for disease control is worth exploring. In our study, 5 (45.45%) patients were treated with glucocorticoids for liver failure before the diagnosis of HLH. Given the early use of glucocorticoids, onset and diagnosis of HLH was likely delayed. Patients with liver failure are prone to various infections, and unable to tolerate the adverse effects of glucocorticoids. If large amounts of corticosteroids are used over a long period of time, secondary infections will become a major cause of death. In our study, 3 of 11 patients died of severe secondary infection in response to high doses of glucocorticoids, representing a life-threatening treatment-related adverse event. Thus, patients with liver failure and HLH can be treated with an initial dose of 1\u20131.5 mg/kg/d methylprednisolone via intravenous infusion. Then, the dose of methylprednisolone should be reduced gradually every 3\u20135 days. Our recommended dose of hormone is significantly lower than that in HLH-2004 regimen. Consequently, controlled temperature, improved liver function, hemogram, and clinical manifestation, whereas decreased serum ferritin indicates an effective treatment. According to the patient\u2019s underlying diseases and HLH trigger factors, some patients were administered with gradually reduced or quickly stopped dosage of glucocorticoids.",
