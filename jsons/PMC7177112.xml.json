Moreover, several patients did not seem to present with obvious respiratory symptoms before dyspnea, but their condition deteriorated rapidly after dyspnea occurred. Another HD center in Wuhan reported that 37/230 HD patients (16.09%) and four/33 medical staff (12.12%) were diagnosed with COVID-19, most with mild symptoms [4], suggesting that HD patients have higher susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection and HD centers are high-risk areas during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
