Given not only the efficient human-to-human, droplet transmission of SARS-CoV-2 but also extensive domestic and international travel in and out of Central China, COVID-19 spreads rapidly. Disease containment efforts largely failed, and the WHO in March 2020 declared a global pandemic status for this insidious virus and viral disease.",

There have hopefully been an equal or much greater number of mildly symptomatic or asymptomatic, undocumented cases of COVID-19-thus promoting herd immunity as we intently await the development, large-scale production, and widespread availability of a safe and effective antiviral agent and/or vaccine.",

As more individuals become immune, newly infected ones are less able to transmit the disease, and the spread of the disease steadily decreases. This phenomenon provides an indirect form of protection for those who are not immune to the infectious disease. 1 COVID-19 remains a rapidly evolving and thus very fluid disease-about which much is still unknown. However, what is clear is the tremendous adverse impact COVID-19 is having on the health and wellbeing of the world's population. The current global pandemic is concomitantly putting enormous stress on health care systems and health care providers. In the absence of timely, valid, and pertinent information, many clinicians are inadequately informed and insufficiently prepared or equipped to manage this new disease.",

And so we humbly and optimistically believe will likewise be our eventual and ultimate successful trajectory with COVID-19. E APPENDIX The contagiousness of a disease can be measured by its reproduction number (R 0 ), which is defined as the mean number of susceptible individuals who are expected to contract the disease (secondary cases) from exposure to a single infected person. For coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), R 0 is currently estimated to be 2-3. By comparison, seasonal influenza has an R 0 of 1.3; the 1918 influenza has an R 0 of 1.8; whereas rubeola has an R 0 of 12-18 (the highest of any infectious, communicable disease). The proportion of the population needed to become immune to achieve herd immunity (the herd immunity threshold) is calculated as 1 -(1/R 0 ). For severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), applying an R 0 value of 2.5, this equates to a herd immunity threshold of 60%. [8] [9] [10] ",
