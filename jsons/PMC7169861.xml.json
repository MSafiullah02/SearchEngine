The study was approved by the local Institutional Review Board. Subjects with signs and symptoms suggestive of upper RTI, such as rhinorrhea, sore throat, or cough, underwent nasal washes; those whose signs and symptoms suggested lower RTI, including wheezing, a >10% fall in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), shortness of breath, or oxygen desaturation, underwent bronchoscopy with bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). Subjects with paramyxovirus infections, including HMPV, PIV, and RSV, were treated for 5 days with inhaled ribavirin (2 g/dose thrice daily) and with a single dose of intravenous (IV) immunoglobulin (400 mg/kg). Patients with RSV also received a single dose of palivizumab (7.5 mg/kg). If the subjects continued to shed virus after 5 days, an additional 2 days of inhaled ribavirin therapy was administered. Patients with FLU A or B received 5 days of oral oseltamivir (75 mg twice daily), but no viral shedding test was performed at the end of therapy. All patients with lower respiratory symptoms received 3 days of IV methylprednisolone 10 mg/kg/day.",

RT\u2010PCR was performed using Qiagen OneStep RT\u2010PCR Kit (QIAGEN Inc.). The assay was carried out in a 50 \u03bcL reaction containing 1 \u00d7 reaction buffer, 0.4 mM dNTPs, 0.6 \u03bcM of each primer, 5 U of RNase inhibitor, 2 \u03bcL of Qiagen OneStep RT\u2010PCR Enzyme Mix, and 5 \u03bcL of extracted RNA.

Microwell hybridization was performed by adding 25 \u03bcL of denatured PCR products in 100 \u03bcL of hybridization buffer (R&D Systems, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA) to specific probe\u2010coated wells, followed by a 60\u2010min incubation at 37\u00b0C. Wells were washed 5 times with 200 \u03bcL wash solution per well and bound amplicon was revealed with Streptavidin\u2010HRP (R&D Systems) and TMB substrate (R&D Systems). The optical density was read at 450 nm. Samples with optical density \u22650.5 were considered positive. Positive and negative controls were included in each run. The sensitivity and specificity of this method were assessed using respiratory specimens characterized previously by culture and an alternative PCR (17).",

Wheezing and/or shortness of breath were the main complaint of 10 patients. Six patients reported fever, chills, or sweats, and 25 reported cough. In 68 episodes, a nasal wash was obtained for etiologic diagnosis, in 22 a BAL, and in the remaining both nasal washes and BALs were performed. Fifty\u2010one RTIs had\u22651 CARV identified, including 7 HMPV, 16 FLU A or B, 19 PIV 1, 2, or 3, 13 RSV, and 3 HRV (Table 2). All the HMPV infections were diagnosed by PCR, which was the only test performed for this virus. Among the other viruses, 6 were detected by PCR only and the remainder had positive results on multiple tests. The higher incidence of positive results by PCR compared with other diagnostic tests was consistent with our previous reports demonstrating the higher sensitivity of PCR (19). PIV was the most frequent cause of CARV\u2010RTIs (17%), with a significantly higher incidence than HRV (3%, P=0.005) or HMPV (6%; P=0.03), but no different than RSV (12%) or FLU (14%). Thirty\u2010six RTIs had a single CARV in the diagnostic specimen and 16 RTIs had \u22652 pathogenic agents, such as 2 CARVs, or a CARV in addition to cytomegalovirus, bacteria, or fungi. The non\u2010viral pathogens isolated from the respiratory tract that were deemed to be contributing to the disease and treated with anti\u2010microbial agents were Aspergillus fumigatus (N=5), Candida albicans (N=1), Escherichia coli (N=1), Klebsiella pneumoniae (N=1), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (N=5), Staphylococcus aureus (N=2), and Streptococcus group C (N=1). Cytomegalovirus (N=2) was equally found in subjects with CARV\u2010RTIs and non\u2010CARV RTIs. However, bacteria and fungi were more commonly found in subjects with CARV\u2010RTIs (N=12) than in those with non\u2010CARV RTIs (N=2). The proportion of infections with a single vs. multiple agents did not significantly differ among CARV\u2010RTIs of different etiology. The RV season in Denver spans from the beginning of October through the end of April. Using this definition, 6 CARV\u2010RTIs (12%) occurred outside of the RV season compared with 15 non\u2010CARV RTIs (29%). All but 1 HMPV infections occurred during the RV season.",

The incidence of HMPV in our patients was similar with the one found by Dare et al. (20), but somewhat lower than the incidence found by others (21, 22). RTIs caused by HMPV in the general population are seasonal with an incidence that may vary from year to year (23, 24). However, it was suggested that in immunocompromised hosts, the incidence of HMPV may be constant (22). In this study, which extended over 2 years, the HMPV\u2010associated RTIs were equally distributed between years and occurred almost exclusively during the RV season. Furthermore, the incidence of HMPV\u2010associated RTI in this study was not appreciably different from the 4% incidence that we found in a retrospective investigation of 83 respiratory specimens from 72 lung transplant recipients with RTIs between November 1999 and March 2000 (19, 25).",

This finding was not unexpected, as children are generally more susceptible to viral infections than adults. The seasonality of the CARV RTIs in the pediatric study was attenuated by the inclusion of herpes viruses and by the high proportion of ADV and HRV infections, which are endemic. A striking difference was seen in the proportion of ADV and HRV infections in the pediatric study compared with ours. This finding may be due to differences in the regional circulation of these viruses, but also begs the question of whether adult transplant recipients maintain some of the immunologic memory of ADVs and HRVs, which mitigates symptomatic infection caused by these agents.",

It is likely that some of the non\u2010CARV RTIs in this study had a viral etiologic agent that was not detectable by the PCR and culture methods used in this study, such as coronaviruses, bocaviruses, or respiratory polyomaviruses. PIV 4, FLU C, and enteroviruses could be detected in culture, albeit not by PCR. Nevertheless, the acute morbidity of unidentified viral infections seemed to be low. Subjects with HMPV\u2010associated RTIs were admitted to the hospital at rates that were not significantly different from those of RSV, FLU, or PIV, suggesting that HMPV had a moderate to high degree of morbidity in the lung transplant population.
