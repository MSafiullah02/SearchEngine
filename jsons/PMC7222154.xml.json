Two genera, Aquabirnavirus and Avibirnavirus, cause economically important diseases such as infectious pancreatic necrosis (IPN) in fish and infectious bursal disease (IBD) in birds, respectively (Hill and Way 1995; Vanden et al. 2000). The viral capsid of birnaviruses is mainly composed of VP2 protein which possesses enormous antigenic propensity (Azad et al. 1987; B\u00f6ttcher et al. 1997; Pous et al. 2005; Letzel et al. 2007; Delmas et al. 2012; Taghavian et al. 2013; Wang et al. 2019).

Moreover, technical expertise or special instruments are not required for performing lateral flow assays. To the best of our knowledge, a lateral flow assay based on the VP2 capsid protein of birnaviruses has not been reported yet. As birnaviruses cause economically important diseases in fish and birds leading to enormous losses in fisheries and poultry industries worldwide, there is an urgent need to develop a lateral flow assay for timely detection of birnaviruses in infected animals. In order to demonstrate that the VP2 capsid protein can be used as a diagnostic antigen for detection of infections caused by birnaviruses, the surface-exposed VP2 protrusion domain of infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV), a representative member of Birnaviridae family, was selected for the development of a gold nanoparticle-based lateral flow assay. The surface-exposed nature of the VP2 protrusion domain also renders it an attractive candidate for vaccine development.",

            "text": "The VP2 protrusion domain of IBDV is a part of the hypervariable region (Tyr206-Thr350) which plays an important role in the induction of neutralizing antibodies against the virus (Azad et al. 1987; Bayliss et al. 1990; Vakharia et al. 1994; Letzel et al. 2007). Moreover, the VP2 protrusion domain is exposed on the surface of the VP2 capsid protein, due to which it is highly immunogenic (Lee et al. 2006). Antigenic variations in the hypervariable region of IBDV lead to the emergence of pathogenic strains (such as very virulent (vvIBDV)) that can evade the host immune response (Vanden et al. 1996). In the late 1980s, vvIBDV (also known as hyper virulent strain (hvIBDV)) was first reported in Europe (Heine et al. 1991), which is responsible for causing severe (up to 100%) mortality in immature chickens (Chettle et al. 1989). Importantly, strains of vvIBDV have rapidly circulated worldwide, being enzootic in Europe, America, Asia, and Africa (Jackwood and Nielsen 1997; Zorman et al. 2003; Banda et al. 2003; Stoute et al. 2013; Mohamed et al. 2014; Khan et al. 2017). IBD mainly affects the bursa of Fabricius with substantial destruction of B lymphocytes (K\u00e4ufer and Weiss 1980). Acute infection with IBDV leads to various clinical signs including diarrhea, depression, ruffled feathers, anorexia, exhaustion, and in severe cases death of chickens (Ley et al. 1983). Several IBD outbreaks, caused by different strains of the virus, have been reported in various geographical regions of the world since the emergence of the disease in 1962 (Cosgrove 1962).",

For this purpose, the recombinant VP2 protrusion domain was heterologously expressed in the Escherichia coli expression system, and we applied biophysical methods to evaluate the stability and proper folding of the heterologously expressed recombinant protein before the development of the lateral flow device (LFD) for on-site detection of anti-IBDV antibodies in infected chickens. The data presented here indicate that the VP2 protrusion domain remains properly folded at elevated temperatures, suggesting that the domain can be used for practical purposes. Hence, the VP2 protrusion domain was exploited as a diagnostic antigen in a colloidal gold nanoparticle-based lateral flow assay for rapid detection of anti-IBDV antibodies. The assay shows promising results for the detection of anti-IBDV antibodies in serum samples and monitoring of immune responses and can be generalized for the detection of anti-birnaviral antibodies in serum samples of other animals infected with birnaviruses.",

A bunch of morphologically similar colonies, resistant to kanamycin (30 \u03bcg/mL), were inoculated into 5\u201310 mL of fresh LBkan broth (kanamycin 30 \u03bcg/mL) and incubated for 16 h at 225 rpm at 37 \u00b0C. The culture was diluted 100 times in LBkan broth and incubated at 37 \u00b0C with continuous shaking at 225 rpm until the OD600 of the culture reached to 0.5\u20130.6. The expression of VP2 protrusion domain was induced by adding isopropyl-\u03b2-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) to a final concentration of 1 mM, and the cells were further grown for 5 h at 37 \u00b0C and 220 rpm. Cells were harvested from the medium by centrifugation (4000\u00d7g for 30 min) and resuspended in 50 mL lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-Cl, pH 7.9, 300 mM NaCl, and 4 mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol (ME)). Following lysis of the cells at 25 Kpsi using a cell disrupter (Constant System Ltd., UK), the supernatant was separated from the cell debris by centrifugation (10,000\u00d7g for 30 min at 4 \u00b0C) using a Beckman centrifuge. The supernatant was used to purify the soluble form of the VP2 protrusion domain through a nickel-nitrilotriacetate (Ni-NTA) agarose column (see ESM for further details). The eluted protein was dialyzed against buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 100 mM NaCl) at 4 \u00b0C overnight, and then concentrated to 5 mg/mL using an ultracentrifugal filter with a 10 kDa molecular weight cut-off (Pierce, 88513). Gel filtration of the concentrated protein was performed at 4 \u00b0C using a Superdex 75 16/60 GL column connected to an \u00c4KTA system (GE Healthcare Life Sciences). The column was equilibrated with pre-chilled, degassed gel filtration buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.9), 100 mM NaCl). The purified protein was quantified using a NanoDrop 2000c spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific), and the purity of the purified protein was analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The identity of the full-length VP2 protrusion domain was confirmed by mass spectrometry at Taplin MS Facility, Harvard Medical School, Boston (http://taplin.med.harvard.edu/), by peptide mass finger printing using chymotrypsin that cleaves at C-terminal to the amino acid sequence (FYWML), not before prolines, under low specificity. Western blot assay was performed according to the protocol described previously (Shah et al. 2017) (see ESM for further details).",

Various amounts of the VP2 protrusion domain (0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0, 1.2, and 1.6 \u03bcg) were mixed with colloidal gold nanoparticles (200 \u03bcL; A530 = 6; pH 7.4 adjusted with K2HPO4 (1 M)) and incubated at room temperature for 10\u201320 min with gentle shaking to produce gold-VP2 protrusion domain conjugates. Then, 10% NaCl (100 \u03bcL) was added to the gold-VP2 protrusion domain conjugate mixture and incubated for 20 min at room temperature. The samples were monitored for the loss of colloidal stability indicated by the change in color from red to purple/gray. For producing stable gold-VP2 domain, 8 \u03bcg (optimal amount) of the recombinant protein (VP2 protrusion domain) was added to 1 mL of colloidal gold solution (A530 = 6; pH 7.4 adjusted with K2HPO4 (1 M)) and mixed gently for 15 min in a shaker at room temperature.

The VP2 capsid protein of IBDV, a member of Birnaviridiae family, has been reported to be highly immunogenic (Azad et al. 1987; Letzel et al. 2007; Taghavian et al. 2013; Wang et al. 2019). Considering the immunogenic nature of the protein, the three-dimensional structure of the VP2 protein was analyzed to identify potential epitopic regions. The VP2 crystal structure (PBD code 2df7) comprises three well-folded domains: a protrusion domain, a shell, and a base domain (Supplementary Fig. S1) (Lee et al. 2006). Among these, the VP2 protrusion domain containing multiple loops is located on the capsid surface which covers the major immunodominant antigenic domain (Asp201-Gly339); therefore, it was selected for testing as a promising immunogenic region for the diagnosis of anti-IBDV antibodies in chickens.",

DNA sequencing results confirmed the integrity of the VP2 protrusion domain and the correct reading frame of the cloned sequence in the vector.

The overexpressed domain in the soluble form was purified using nickel-affinity chromatography to more than 95% purity in quantities sufficient for structural studies and antibody detection (Fig. 2a). The obtained yield of the VP2 protrusion domain was 10 mg/L culture volume. The sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) analysis showed that the purified domain migrates in three oligomeric forms corresponding to apparent molecular weights of ~ 13 kDa, ~ 23 kDa, and ~ 35 kDa, representing monomeric, dimeric, and trimeric forms of the protein, respectively, and suggesting that higher oligomers were SDS-\u03b2ME-heat resistant. The identity of these oligomer forms was confirmed by western blotting using anti-His6 antibodies (Fig. 2b). The apparent faster migration of the oligomers (monomers, dimmers, and trimers) on the SDS-PAGE gel compared with their calculated molecular weights (17 kDa, 34 kDa, and 51 kDa) can be attributed to the relatively high hydrophobic content (70%) of the domain as predicted by hydropathy analysis (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/seqstats/emboss_pepinfo) (Fig. 2c) (Kyte and Doolittle 1982). Such migration behavior is usually displayed by proteins that contain a higher proportion of hydrophobic amino acids and is commonly observed in the case of membrane proteins (Rahman et al. 2007).",

The analysis revealed that the CD spectrum was almost unaltered for the domain heated to 50 \u00b0C and reproduced the same minima and maxima as the non-heated protein (25 \u00b0C). Exceeding this temperature, there was a significant decrease observed in the CD ellipticity, indicating that the domain loses its folded conformation at temperatures higher than 50 \u00b0C (Fig. 3c). Furthermore, to verify the thermal stability of the domain, ThermoFluor assay was performed and data were analyzed using the CFX Manager software (Rosa et al. 2015). The resulting sigmoidal thermal shift curve showed that the recombinant domain retained its folded conformation up to 50 \u00b0C. The melting temperature (Tm) of 60 \u00b0C obtained at the midpoint of the curve and at the apex of the 1st derivative depicts partial unfolding of the protein (Fig. 3d).",

For comparison, a negative sample (consisting of 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) and antisera isolated from the SPF chicken (5\u00d7)) was also applied to the sample pad. In the case of positive anti-IBDV samples, two red lines appeared: one at the test region and the other at the control region. In contrast, only a single line appeared at the control region in the case of negative samples (Supplementary Fig. S5). These results confirmed the presence of anti-IBDV antibodies in serum samples of chickens, suggesting that the strip could successfully be applied for diagnosis of anti-IBDV antibodies in chickens. In the absence of specific antibodies, sometimes due to the (non-specific) interaction of VP2-gold nanoparticle conjugates with proteins from the serum, large aggregates termed as clouds or corona are formed (de Puig et al. 2017) which interfere with the signal intensity at the control line. Therefore, various dilutions (10\u00d7, 20\u00d7, 30\u00d7, and 100\u00d7) of antisera isolated from SPF-chickens were tested in order to get the best signal, and signals with improved quality were observed in the diluted SPF-antisera, likely due to less non-specific proteins (Supplementary Fig. S5a, b). We find that the signal intensity at the control line increases when antisera raised against the VP2 protrusion domain are printed instead of anti-IBDV antisera at the control line (Supplementary Fig. S5c).",

            "text": "Birnaviruses cause economically important diseases in fish and birds (Vanden et al. 2000; Delmas et al. 2012). The genome of birnaviruses encodes multiple proteins including VP2 (38 kDa) and VP3 (33 kDa) which are structural proteins constituting the viral capsid (Cast\u00f3n et al. 2001). However, VP2 and VP3 are external and internal capsid proteins, respectively (Cast\u00f3n et al. 2001; Owoade et al. 2004). VP3 contains a group-specific antigen, but VP2 is the only structural protein that elicits neutralizing antibodies (Fahey et al. 1989; Bayliss et al. 1990; Owoade et al. 2004) and possesses enormous antigenic propensity (Azad et al. 1987; B\u00f6ttcher et al. 1997; Pous et al. 2005; Letzel et al. 2007; Delmas et al. 2012; Taghavian et al. 2013; Wang et al. 2019). Moreover, VP2 contains a major immunodominant antigenic domain (protrusion domain) which spans a hypervariable region and harbors main targets of protective and neutralizing antibodies (Vakharia et al. 1994). In order to demonstrate that the VP2 protrusion domain can be exploited as a diagnostic antigen for birnaviruses, we developed here a lateral flow assay based on the VP2 protrusion domain of a representative birnavirus, IBDV, which causes the highly devastating infectious bursal disease in chickens. The VP2 protrusion domain is found in all genera of Birnaviridae family, and domains from different birnaviruses share a similar overall fold (Supplementary Fig. S6). Capsid protein\u2011based lateral flow assays have recently received increased attention due to their ease-of-use and cost-effectiveness (Sun et al. 2014; Sastre et al. 2016). A capsid protein\u2013based lateral flow assay is currently not available for birnaviruses. In this study, the VP2 protrusion domain (Asp201-Gly339) was selected as a diagnostic antigen since it is exposed on the surface of the protein and protrudes out of the viral capsid, suggesting that the domain can act as an epitopic region (Vakharia et al. 1994; Lee et al. 2006). Furthermore, different studies have revealed that protein\u2013protein interactions that lead to cellular functions such as signaling, regulation, and antibody neutralization are mediated through surface loops of proteins (Drakopoulou et al. 1996; Osajima and Hoshino 2016).",

            "text": "The VP2 protrusion domain was heterologously expressed in a soluble form in E. coli and purified through chromatographic techniques. To the best of our knowledge, the recombinant VP2 protrusion domain heterologously expressed in prokaryotic or eukaryotic systems has not been used in a lateral flow assay yet. The associated advantage with the heterologous expression of the VP2 protrusion domain is that the protein can be produced in sufficient amounts readily and cost-effectively, allowing the diagnostic capacity of the lateral flow assay to be easily scaled up for large flocks. However, the proper folding of recombinant proteins produced in heterologous expression systems is a major key point for successfully conducting structural and functional studies. A protein produced in the soluble fraction may not always be folded into a stable secondary structure conformation compared with the native protein structure. Therefore, to produce an authentic protein for practical applications such as for use in the lateral flow assay, biophysical studies of the VP2 protrusion domain were performed using CD and FTIR spectroscopic techniques. These studies revealed that the domain is properly folded containing a high proportion of \u03b2-sheet secondary structures similar to the native VP2 protrusion domain (PDB code 2df7) (Lee et al. 2006). For field applications, the stability of recombinant proteins is of utmost importance in diverse environmental conditions. Therefore, the folded conformation of the VP2 protrusion domain was evaluated at elevated temperatures using CD spectroscopy and ThermoFlour assay. The domain was found structurally stable and remained properly folded at 50 \u00b0C, suggesting that the protein could be used for a wide range of field applications on the basis of its thermal stability. Similar to the native form of the VP2 full-length protein, the VP2 protrusion domain exists as a trimer (Azad et al. 1987; Letzel et al. 2007; Taghavian et al. 2013; Wang et al. 2019). It has been reported previously that the oligomeric state of the full-length VP2 protein is stabilized upon binding of calcium ions (Lee et al. 2006). Interestingly, the domain is devoid of the calcium binding site, even then it exists in a trimeric state. These characteristics, combined with sufficiently high thermostability, render the purified VP2 protrusion domain an attractive target for use as a diagnostic antigen in immunoassays.",

The reactivity criteria were analyzed by the appearance of red lines at test and control regions within 3\u20135 min after addition of the serum sample. The gold nanoparticle-based lateral flow assay can efficiently detect anti-IBDV antibodies in antisera samples from infected chickens which were confirmed as positive antisera samples using a commercially available ELISA kit, suggesting that the reported assay yields comparable qualitative results as obtained through ELISA. However, the ELISA is a highly sensitive method for the detection of anti-IBDV antibodies (Dey et al. 2009; Singh et al. 2010), but here, we have developed a lateral flow assay based on VP2 protrusion domain which is a rapid on-site diagnostic test for the detection of anti-IBDV antibodies in infected chickens. Compared with ELISA, which needs laboratory equipment and trained personnel, the lateral flow assay is a fast, easy, and cost-effective technique for the diagnosis of anti-IBDV antibodies. To monitor the pathogenic IBDV in the infected chickens, previously, a one-step anti-IBDV antibody strip was developed for the detection of the virus from the bursa samples (Zhang et al. 2005). In our study, we have developed LFD based on the VP2 protrusion domain for the detection of the anti-IBDV antibodies of serotype 1 in the serum samples was conducted using antisera collected from the blood of infected chickens. Due to a highly stable nature of the VP2 protrusion domain, the developed LFD kit has a shelf-life of 21 months, tested so far.",

The biophysical characterization of the purified domain reveals that the domain remains folded at high temperatures, making it suitable for diagnostic purposes. The lateral flow assay was used to successfully detect antibodies specific to IBDV in the serum samples of infected chickens during laboratory testing and on-site testing. Similar to a commercial ELISA, the lateral flow assay reported here allows the detection of anti-IBDV antibodies in serum samples of infected chickens and has a shelf-life of 21 months tested so far. The lateral flow assay can be generalized for the detection of other birnaviruses and members of Tetraviridae and Nodaviridae families which contain homologous VP2 capsid proteins.",
