In this concept, the PS-SCL (Fig. 3) , the substrate library comprises three 'sublibraries' to study protease preferences at the P4, P3 and P2 positions. For instance, in the P4 sublibrary, this position was fixed with one of the natural amino acids (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) (17) (18) (19) , the P3-P2 positions were randomized with equimolar mixtures of natural amino acids (making this library useful to study various caspases), and the P1-P1 0 positions were occupied by Asp-7-amino-4methyl-coumarin (AMC). The caspase specificity preferences in the active site pockets were obtained by screening each position separately, making this approach 'positional profiling'. Shortly after, the Ellman and Craik groups utilized a bifunctional 7-amino-4-carbamoylmethylcoumarin (ACC) fluorophore as a reporter group in PS-SCL, making introducing various amino acids at the P1 position much more effortless [18] . To date, over 100 proteases have been profiled with the PS-SCL approach, ranking this technology among the most useful tools in protease substrate specificity investigations [8] . However, traditional PS-SCL has been demonstrated to be insufficient when analyzing proteases with overlapping substrate specificity profiles (e.g. caspases, cysteine cathepsins, neutrophil proteases and deubiquitylating enzymes (DUBs)). The use of only natural amino acids in a PS-SCL reduces the chance of finding a specific (and/or very active) peptide toward the protease of interest. This drawback was overcome by a novel approach developed in the Drag laboratory [19] . This concept, the HyCoSuL, relies on the use of a broad panel of unnatural amino acids in the substrate sequences, which explore the protease active site much more accurately than a set of 20 natural analogues alone (Fig. 3) . The use of unnatural amino acids in fluorogenic substrate libraries was also applied in the CoSeSuL [12] . This approach is restricted to proteases that display very broad substrate specificity in one (or more) active site pockets. By comparing such a specificity matrix with other proteases displaying narrower specificity in corresponding pocket(s), it becomes possible to distinguish between enzymes. PS-SCL, HyCo-SuL and CoSeSuL are valuable tools to study protease substrate specificities; however, they are all limited to the non-prime pockets of the enzyme active site. IQF substrates offer an excellent platform to study protease preferences in both prime and non-prime regions (Fig. 4) [20] . In brief, IQF substrates are peptides of various lengths flanked by a fluorescence group (donor) and a quencher group (acceptor). Such intact peptides are in a quenched state, as the fluorescence from the donor is quenched by an appropriate acceptor. Once the peptide is cleaved by the protease, the peptide fragment with the fluorophore is separated from the quencher, and the fluorescence is liberated. Currently, there is no single, unified technology using IQF substrates in protease screenings, and the architecture of an IQF substrate library is tailored to the protease being investigated. To date, various donoracceptor pairs have been described in the literature and are reviewed elsewhere [8] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 90, "end": 123, "text": "Thornberry and colleagues in 1997", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 124, "end": 128, "text": "[16,", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 129, "end": 132, "text": "17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 385, "end": 388, "text": "(1)", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 389, "end": 392, "text": "(2)", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 393, "end": 396, "text": "(3)", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 397, "end": 400, "text": "(4)", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 401, "end": 404, "text": "(5)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 405, "end": 408, "text": "(6)", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 409, "end": 412, "text": "(7)", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 413, "end": 416, "text": "(8)", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 417, "end": 420, "text": "(9)", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 421, "end": 425, "text": "(10)", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 426, "end": 430, "text": "(11)", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 431, "end": 435, "text": "(12)", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 436, "end": 440, "text": "(13)", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 441, "end": 445, "text": "(14)", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 446, "end": 450, "text": "(15)", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 451, "end": 455, "text": "(16)", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 456, "end": 460, "text": "(17)", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 461, "end": 465, "text": "(18)", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 466, "end": 470, "text": "(19)", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1081, "end": 1085, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1262, "end": 1265, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 1737, "end": 1741, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 2071, "end": 2075, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 2666, "end": 2670, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 3372, "end": 3375, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 163, "end": 171, "text": "(Fig. 3)", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 1960, "end": 1968, "text": "(Fig. 3)", "ref_id": "FIGREF2"}, {"start": 2657, "end": 2665, "text": "(Fig. 4)", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "As an alternative to chemical-based approaches, a phage display technology of biological origins has also been extensively developed and studied on proteolytic enzymes.

This technique was initially oriented to studying protein-protein interactions; however, it was later modified and adapted for protease substrate specificity profiling (Fig. 3 ) [22] . The main advantage of phage display is the generation of a very large and diverse pool of substrates (up to 10 10 individual peptides), which would be very challenging through chemical synthesis. Another important feature of this technique is that these peptides are subjected to protease analysis after each round of expression/selection; thus, in subsequent cycles, peptides of increasing quality are generated. One of the main drawbacks of these methods is that the peptides are label-free. Therefore, the kinetic analysis of the best substrates requires these peptides to be resynthesized with an appropriate reporter group.

In this method, a rapid multiplex substrate profiling analysis using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry sequencing was applied to profile the substrates of neutrophil serine proteases in human neutrophil extracellular traps.

Those proteases are packed into cytoplasmic granules, and similarly to NSPs, they are secreted during stimulation. In humans, five Grs are distinguished (A, B, H, K and M) [48] .

Both groups used the same strategy to modify serpins (endogenous inhibitors of serine proteases), the reactive center loop of which is crucial for inhibiting serine proteases. The amino acids near the scissile bond of the reactive center loop were modified in another approach by extracting structural fragments to obtain specific recombinant hK2 [70] and hK14 [71] inhibitors. In these approaches, phage display methodology was used to select peptide sequences for hK2 (six variants) and hK14 (two variants). hK14 has a dual (chymo)trypsin-like substrate specificity, and Felber et al. described four variants of recombinant mutant serpins (two variants for serpin): a-1-antitrypsin (AAT) and antichymotrypsin (ACT).

Such primary specificity is quite rare among proteases. However, Wells and colleagues have recently shown that these enzymes can also cleave substrates after glutamic acid and phosphoserine residues, shedding new light on their physiological functions [74] . Since the discovery and characterization of caspases 20 years ago, hundreds of papers have been published on their substrates and inhibitors [9, 75] . Unfortunately, their exclusive specificity for Asp at the P1 position makes it very difficult to distinguish these enzymes [76] . Using PS-SCL as a tool, Thornberry and colleagues determined the substrate preferences of the S4-S2 pockets of nine human caspases [17] . Based on these profiles, caspases were divided into three groups: caspase-1, -4 and -5, which prefer the (W/L)EHD sequence, caspase-3, -7 and -2, which recognize DE(V/ H)D peptides, and caspase-6, -8 and -9, which favor (V/L)EHD motifs. Nevertheless, the specificity matrix clearly shows that these proteases display overlapping substrate specificity, and the 'optimal sequences' proposed by the authors may not be specific for only one enzyme. Indeed, later work by other groups has shown that short inherent substrates containing tetrapeptide motifs display cross-reactivity among the caspases, making it very difficult to use these substrates in cell extracts that contain different concentrations of several caspases [4, 77] . In another approach to design caspase-specific substrates, Stennicke and colleagues synthesized a panel of IQF substrates (Fig. 4) [78] . This strategy also allowed the authors to screen caspase preferences in the prime region (i.e. to the right of the scissile bond). A kinetic analysis revealed that all tested caspases (1, 3, 6, 7 and 8) preferred small residues (Gly, Ser and Ala) at P1 0 , which could not be used as a discrimination factor to improve the specificity of the synthesized substrates. The inability to design caspase-specific substrates using a PS-SCL approach or by scanning internally quenched substrates could be due to their simple architecture. In these chemical approaches, the substrates are short linear peptides selected from a pool of peptide mixtures without an in-depth caspase subsite cooperativity analysis. Biological approaches represent an alternative strategy for substrate identification. One such strategy tested on caspases was the application of cellular libraries of peptide substrates (CLiPS), developed by Boulware et al. [79] , in which potential caspase substrates were randomly synthesized by bacteria and then subjected to fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis. This technique not only provided a general map of caspase preferences but also revealed detailed kinetic analyses of the substrates. However, the obtained results only confirmed that the preferred caspase-3 cleavage motif is DXVD/G, and new specific sequences were not identified. The main limitation of the described methods (using both synthetic and natural substrates) is that all of these peptides contain only natural amino acids in their structure. A potential solution is an approach that has been recently proposed by Poreba et al. [80] . In the HyCoSuL approach, P4-P2 peptide mixtures are enriched with over 100 unnatural amino acids, which provides a better exploration of the chemical space in the caspase active sites and attenuates the issue of overlapping specificity. The specificity of six human apoptotic caspases (3, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10) toward the P4-P2 positions were screened using this approach. A detailed kinetic analysis of their preferences allowed the development of peptides containing unnatural amino acids that had much greater selectivity indices than the previously reported substrates (Fig. 6) . One of these substrates was then used to specifically monitor caspase-9 activation in HEK293F cytosolic extracts, in which apoptosis is triggered by cytochrome C [80] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 148, "end": 152, "text": "[73]", "ref_id": "BIBREF72"}, {"start": 407, "end": 411, "text": "[74]", "ref_id": "BIBREF73"}, {"start": 555, "end": 558, "text": "[9,", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 559, "end": 562, "text": "75]", "ref_id": "BIBREF74"}, {"start": 688, "end": 692, "text": "[76]", "ref_id": "BIBREF75"}, {"start": 826, "end": 830, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1554, "end": 1557, "text": "[4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1558, "end": 1561, "text": "77]", "ref_id": "BIBREF76"}, {"start": 1695, "end": 1699, "text": "[78]", "ref_id": "BIBREF77"}, {"start": 2630, "end": 2634, "text": "[79]", "ref_id": "BIBREF78"}, {"start": 3321, "end": 3325, "text": "[80]", "ref_id": "BIBREF79"}, {"start": 3613, "end": 3635, "text": "(3, 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 4071, "end": 4075, "text": "[80]", "ref_id": "BIBREF79"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1686, "end": 1694, "text": "(Fig. 4)", "ref_id": "FIGREF3"}, {"start": 3898, "end": 3906, "text": "(Fig. 6)", "ref_id": "FIGREF5"}], "section": "Caspases and paracaspases"}, {"text": "Another challenging issue in distinguishing between caspases is the development of specific inhibitors.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Caspases and paracaspases"}, {"text": "Because potent and selective caspase inhibitors appear as potential drug candidates, this area of research has been explored more rigorously than the identification of caspase substrates.

Some caspase inhibitors have been synthesized and used to study apoptosis in vitro and in vivo, whereas others are primarily used in pharmaceutical research [81] [82] [83] . In general, almost all strategies for developing caspase-specific inhibitors focus on (a) optimizing a peptide (or peptidomimetic) scaffold (non-prime region), (b) exploring the S1 0 pocket by introducing various warheads (cysteine traps) into PS-SCL-derived peptides (mostly DEVD, IETD and YVAD), or (c) optimizing lead non-peptide scaffold structures, such as isatins, indolones and quinolines. In previous studies, synthetic caspase inhibitors were simple peptides equipped with an electrophilic warhead (e.g. acyloxymethylketone (AOMK), fluoromethyl ketone, or an aldehyde) [9] . The peptide motifs were based on the PS-SCL results reported by Thornberry et al. [17] . However, these tools were subsequently shown to display only limited selectivity toward individual caspases [84, 85] . As the inclusion of natural amino acids in the P4-P1 positions has not produced specific inhibitors, unnatural amino acids have been introduced into peptide scaffolds. This work was pioneered by Bogyo and colleagues, who synthesized a P4-P2 combinatorial library of AOMK inhibitors containing 41 unnatural amino acids at each position [86] . The same approach was further applied by Wolan and colleagues, who synthesized a P5-P2 peptide library containing an aldehyde as an electrophilic warhead [87] [88] [89] .

The six cathepsins exhibited similar substrate preferences; the only significant difference was that cathepsin K recognized Pro at P2, whereas all other cathepsins did not. This distinguishing feature was sufficient to develop a cathepsin K-specific tetrapeptide substrate that was not hydrolyzed by other family members. However, an AOMK inhibitor with this sequence displayed off-target activity by also inhibiting cathepsin B. Another strategy for the rapid development of cathepsin substrates was substrate activity screening (SAS), proposed by Patterson et al. [94] [95] [96] . In this method, a library of aminocoumarin derivatives with various N-acyl groups was screened for activity against cathepsin S and the most active substrates were further converted into inhibitors. With the exception of PS-SCL and SAS, no other rapid methods for the discovery of selective cathepsin substrates have been reported.

Another strategy for the development of potent and selective cathepsin inhibitors is the previously mentioned SAS, in which the best substrates are converted into potent inhibitors by replacing the aminocoumarin reporter group with an electrophilic pharmacophore [95] . One such seminal example is the cathepsin S probe (BMV157) developed by Oresic Bender et al. [102] . BMV157 is a near-infrared quenched-activity-based probe that becomes fluorescent only when bound to the cathepsin S active site. This molecule contains a Cy-5 fluorophore attached to a P1-Lys residue, a peptidomimetic fragment in the P3-P2 region and an acyloxymethylketone warhead equipped with QSY21, a bulky quenching group. The specificity of this probe toward cathepsin S was tested in both in vivo and in vitro models, demonstrating the wide range of its biological applications.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 269, "end": 274, "text": "[100]", "ref_id": "BIBREF99"}, {"start": 659, "end": 664, "text": "[101]", "ref_id": "BIBREF100"}, {"start": 833, "end": 838, "text": "[101]", "ref_id": "BIBREF100"}, {"start": 1273, "end": 1277, "text": "[95]", "ref_id": "BIBREF94"}, {"start": 1373, "end": 1378, "text": "[102]", "ref_id": "BIBREF101"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Cysteine cathepsins"}, {"text": "Legumain (asparaginyl endopeptidase) is a cysteine protease that is up-regulated in inflammatory diseases and multiple human cancers. Legumain is also very active in the tumor microenvironment; thus, it is thought to promote tumorigenesis. This protease shares some similarities with both previously described protease groups, caspases and cysteine cathepsins. An analysis of the tertiary structure of legumain assigned it to the CD clan (together with caspases, gingipains and separases). However, the localization of this enzyme is mainly lysosomal/endosomal, overlapping with cysteine cathepsins [103] . Thus, to specifically target legumain, there is a need to distinguish this protease from caspases and cysteine cathepsins. However, this goal is very challenging as legumain displays narrow specificity at the P1 position, recognizing only Asn and Asp residues. The first (quenched) activitybased probe that specifically targeted legumain in vivo (LE-28) was developed by the Bogyo group [104] . It contained a three-peptide scaffold (Glu-Pro-Asp) equipped with an acyloxymethylketone warhead and flanked by two bulky groups (Cy-5 as a fluorophore and QSY21 as a fluorescence quencher) (Fig. 4) . As Glu-Pro-Asp is the preferred motif of caspases, the specificity of LE-28 was obtained not by sequence itself, but by introducing bulky groups that drive LE-28 cellular uptake into the lysosomes. Another approach to distinguish legumain from caspases was recently proposed by Poreba et al. [12] . Using HyCo-SuL, the authors demonstrated that the legumain specificity at the P4 position was very broad, tolerating even D-amino acids (Fig. 6 ). Thus, it was possible to use counter selection to extract a P4-P1 tetrapeptide motif (with Asp at P1) that was not recognized by apoptotic caspases. This motif was then used to develop a legumain-specific substrate, inhibitor, and activity-based probe for tracking legumain activity in various biological models.

In another approach, Borodovsky and colleagues used a chemical ligation method (intein strategy), in which the C terminus of the ubiquitin protein was modified with different warheads [106, 107] .
