Acute diarrhea is a syndrome that is frequently not differentiated clinically by specific etiologic agent. The wide spectrum of evolution varies from self-limited disease to death. Death is mainly due to dehydration and children in developing countries pay the highest tribute to acute diarrhea. This chapter examines the viral and bacterial causes of acute diarrhea, clinically defined by the emission of three or more loose or watery stools per day or a definite decrease in consistency and increase in frequency based upon an individual baseline lasting for less than 2 weeks. Parasitic infections of the gastrointestinal tract will be presented in Chapter 109 and diarrhea associated with food poisoning will be presented in Chapter 34. When diarrhea lasts for 14 days it can be considered persistent; the term chronic generally refers to diarrhea that lasts for at least 1 month (see Chapter 36).",

The network observed that 6% of interviewed people reported an acute diarrheal illness during the 4 weeks preceding the interview, i.e. an annualized rate of 0.72 episodes per person-year. Rates of illness were highest among children younger than 5 years (1.1 episodes per person-year) and were lowest in persons aged \u226565 years (0.32 episodes per person-year).3 A study in 2000 that estimated the economic burden of both infectious and noninfectious gastrointestinal and liver disease in the USA found that the most prevalent diseases were non-food-borne gastroenteritis (135 million cases per year) and food-borne illness (76 million cases per year).4 A report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) found that food-borne diseases account for approximately 76 million illnesses, 325 000 hospitalizations and 5000 deaths each year in the USA based upon surveillance data from multiple sources.5 In the Netherlands, the incidence of gastroenteritis was 45 per 100 person-years in a prospective study.6\n",

In severe infectious diarrhea, the daily volume of stool may exceed 2 liters. Dehydration and loss of potassium (hypokalemia) are two life-threatening consequences of severe diarrhea. Water is mainly absorbed in small bowel (for about 8 liters a day in an adult) and further in the colon. By the time the initial 8 liters of fluid reaches the ileocecal valve, only about 600 ml remain, representing an efficiency of water absorption of 93%. By the time the remaining 600 ml of fluid reaches the anus, only about 100 ml of fluid remains, generally as formed feces. In the small intestine, water is absorbed by three basic mechanisms:\u2022\u2018neutral\u2019 sodium chloride (NaCl) absorption mediated by two coupled systems \u2013 one exchanges Na/H (cation exchanger) and the other exchanges Cl/HCO3 (anion exchanger);\u2022\u2018electrogenic\u2019 sodium absorption where sodium enters the cell via an electrochemical gradient (this electrogenic sodium absorption mechanism is commonly damaged during acute enteric infection); and\u2022sodium co-transport.\n",

Although generally self-limited, relapses and chronic diarrhea are possible, as well as extraintestinal infection including bacteremia. Campylobacter jejunii infection is the most frequently recognized infection preceding the development of Guillain\u2013Barr\u00e9 syndrome.19 The mechanisms rely on the cross-reactivity between ganglioside-like motifs present in Campylobacter jejunii lipopolysaccharide and those of peripheral nerves. Also, this species has been associated with immunoproliferative small intestinal disease.20 Species other than Campylobacter jejunii and Campylobacter coli are increasingly isolated from the stools of patients with diarrhea, including Campylobacter fetus, mainly isolated from extraintestinal sites, and Campylobacter upsaliensis.

In Europe, children with rotavirus-positive acute gastroenteritis were more likely to have lethargy, fever, vomiting and dehydration, and, therefore, more severe disease than were children with rotavirus-negative acute gastroenteritis. Dehydration was up to 5.5 times more likely in children with rotavirus-positive acute gastroenteritis than in those with rotavirus-negative acute gastroenteritis.50 Acquisition of rotaviruses is likely from subclinical infection in parents or siblings but rotavirus infection can be a zoonosis. Rotaviruses are resistant in inanimate environments which may be implicated as a source of infection, including nosocomial outbreaks.

In contrast to the fortunate decrease in mortality, morbidity remains as high as during the previous century. However, simple, cheap measures could be undertaken to make the incidence fall. A prospective study in India demonstrated that the promotion of hand washing with plain soap reduced by 53% the incidence of acute diarrhea (and of pneumonia and impetigo).57 Indeed, hand washing with soap is effective against almost all enteritis-causing pathogens, whereas efficacy of alcohol against rotavirus and calicivirus remains controversial.58 In developed countries, prevention relies on increased sanitary measures in collective sources of enteric pathogens such as swimming pools and recreational lakes for fishing and swimming, as well as better control over fresh foodstuffs.
