Incidences ranging from 2 to 24% have been reported, which might reflect different autopsy policies amongst centres. Recent studies have shown that many patients with invasive aspergillosis do not have a haematological diagnosis. Instead, conditions such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and liver failure became recognized as important risk factors. The diagnosis remains difficult in these patients, since diagnostic tests have not been widely validated outside the haematological boundaries. Mechanical ventilation precludes the interpretation of clinical signs and radiological diagnosis is clouded by underlying lung pathology. Respiratory cultures lack sensitivity and specificity. At the moment, diagnosis is best made by testing for galactomannan in bronchoalveolar fluid samples (sensitivity and specificity of > 87%). Testing galactomannan in sera has limited sensitivity for the non-neutropenic. Modern diagnostic tests such as PCR and beta-glucan have never been validated in an ICU population. Due mostly to major delays in the diagnosis, mortality exceeds 50%. Although our therapeutic armamentarium against invasive aspergillosis has improved in recent years, data concerning safety and efficacy of new antifungal agents in the ICU setting are lacking.",

            "text": "Autopsy studies show the emergence of Aspergillus as a major pathogen, as well as the expansion of the spectrum of patients at risk for IA. In a non-selected patient population, the prevalence of invasive fungal infections in an academic hospital rose from 2.2 to 5.1% over a 12-year period, largely due to an increase in Aspergillus infections [1] . However, estimates about the incidence of IA in critically ill patients are sparse and variable. For various reasons, figures about the true incidence are difficult to generate. First, in case of a positive culture for Aspergillus species, discriminating between colonisation and infection remains challenging. Second, very few institutions perform post-mortem examinations routinely, while in most cases, this is the only way for proving the definite nature of the diagnosis. Third, characteristic radiological signs of IA are usually absent in the non-neutropenic ICU patient. Finally, to date, the diagnostic utility of recently available non-culture based microbiological tools, including the detection of fungal antigens and the detection of Aspergillus-specific DNA through polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques, has not been properly validated in the non-haematology ICU population. In addition, typical ICU patients such as those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or liver disorders were not considered amongst hosts at high risk for IA in the recently updated EORTC/MSG guidelines [2] .",

In a medical ICU, we have observed high incidences of IA in two separate retrospective autopsy-controlled studies. In the largest one, 127 of 1850 (6.9%) hospitalised patients had microbiological or histopathological evidence of aspergillosis during their ICU stay, including 89 cases (70%) without underlying haematological malignancy. The observed mortality of 80% was much higher than the predicted mortality as per SAPS II score (48%) [4] . An earlier study looked for unsuspected causes of death in the same medical ICU and showed that, out of 100 autopsies, there were 15 cases of IA, of which 5 were missed pre-mortem [3] . During a 6-year period, Cornillet et al. found a mean number of 15 patients per year diagnosed with IA; approximately half of them were in the ICU [9] . These inter-centre differences can be explained by differences in underlying patient characteristics, case mix and different autopsy policies.",

Most patients had non-haematological diseases (67%), including liver cirrhosis (21%), COPD (14%) and other systemic conditions (15%). The incidence of proven IA in this population was surprisingly high at 23.6%, which might have been associated with the high frequency of autopsy (95% of fatalities), as well as the use of a sensitive diagnostic tool (more comments about galactomannan testing are presented below). As this was a single-centre study, the presence of an outbreak is also a possibility.",

Although many of these infected patients will eventually be admitted to the ICU for advanced supportive care, it seems that IA has also gained a foothold in less severely compromised ICU patients [7] . So, can a threshold of immunosuppression needed for the development of IA be defined? We grouped the risk factors for IA in the ICU are into 3 categories (high, intermediate, low) ( Table 2) . Various factors adversely affect the defence systems of previously healthy individuals, including the prolonged use of antibiotics, the use of central venous catheters and/or mechanical ventilation. Although these factors are present in most ICU patients, many of them do not develop IA. One of the intriguing hypotheses for immunosuppression in the apparently immunocompetent patient with multiple organ dysfunctions is related to the biphasic response to sepsis. The initial hyperinflammatory phase is followed by relative immunoparalysis [11] . This latter process is characterized by neutrophil deactivation and may put the patient at risk for developing opportunistic infections such as IA. Further epidemiological study is warranted to better delineate this phase of immunoparalysis. More detail on the interactions between Aspergillus and the immune system are presented in the chapter by Dr Romani.",

Recent work concluded that the mortality is reduced if septic shock patients with adrenal dysfunction receive hydrocortisone for a 7-day period [12] . In vitro, however, pharmacological concentrations of hydrocortisone accelerate the growth of Aspergillus spp. [13] . Clearly, high steroid intake diminishes both lines of cellular defence against IA (macrophages and neutrophils). Palmer reported that the threshold steroid level varies according to the type of patients and emphasized that underlying lung disease is a risk factor for IA even at low doses [14] . Further study is needed to investigate whether the 7 day course of hydrocortisone at 200-mg/day in patients with septic shock puts them at risk for IA, knowing that recognition of fungal infection may be delayed, since the anti-inflammatory properties of steroids blunt the signs of infection.",

However, aerosolised spores may become a potential source of infection through improperly cleaned ventilation systems, water systems or even computer consoles. The use of High Efficiency Particulate Air (HEPA) filtration reduces the risk of IA but does not reduce it to zero, probably partly because patients may be colonised before admission to the ICU, partly because of breaks in airflow. Pittet described two patients who developed fatal IA in the ICU. In retrospect, high concentrations of airborne Aspergillus spores could be found, closely related to air filter change in the ICU [23] . Besides the airborne route, contaminated water has been implicated as a source of infection [24] . A study of ventilators as a source of infection has not been undertaken. Of note, the development of IA is depends on an interplay between the inoculating dose, the ability of the host to resist infection (which also depends on the lung architecture) and the virulence of the infecting organism.",

This can be present in patients with defective mucociliary clearance and structural changes in the bronchial wall. These changes are present in almost every mechanically ventilated patient, making them particularly susceptible to colonisation. IA will not develop in these patients unless a critical level of immunodeficiency has been reached. The second type of interaction is allergic in nature and is beyond the scope of this review (these are discussed in other chapter in this book). The most relevant form of interaction for ICU physicians is the invasive disease that develops in persons with impaired immunity. The aggressive angioinvasive form is frequently encountered in neutropenic patients, whereas cavitating infiltrates are observed most frequently in patients on steroids, patients with COPD, cirrhosis, and solid organ transplant recipients. Other more rare presentations include endocarditis, wound infections, mediastinitis (post-cardiac surgery), infection of vascular grafts, and osteomyelitis. These are occasionally a problem in immunocompromised patients and may occur as outbreaks. Infection of the central nervous system is frequently an ominous sign and may arise from haematogenous seeding (in which the lung is the most common primary site) or spread from the sinuses or following neurosurgery.",

Although very useful in the haematological patient [29] , serum GM is not a sensitive marker for IA in the non-neutropenic individual, as demonstrated in lung and liver transplant recipients [30, 31] . Viable fungi could endure in the lung tissue (with encapsulation by an inflammatory process), while circulating markers remain undetectable because of clearance by circulating neutrophils. BAL fluid could be a better specimen for GM detection as recently was demonstrated in a prospective study performed in a medical ICU in a tertiary referral hospital [10] . This is reinforced by the data with the solid organ transplant population [32] [33] [34] . On the other hand, GM testing in BAL fluid samples seems very promising for the diagnosis of IA in non-neutropenic patients [10, 35] . Results from a single ICU showed that test sensitivity and specificity were 88 and 87%, respectively using a cut-off of 0.5 for BAL testing. In contrast, the sensitivity of serum GM was 42% only. A bit of caution, however, is required with this, since the best cut-off for GM testing in BAL [36] . Accordingly, many studies have shown that testing GM in BAL fluid samples result in higher optical densities than testing sera [33, 37] . In a study with non-immunocompromised patients, all cases of IA were associated with GM optical densities of \u2265 1.18 in the BAL [34] . A higher cut-off value for BAL has also been suggested by other authors, in comparison to sera [32, 33] . False-positive results have been observed when BAL is tested for GM in patients colonised with Aspergillus species, particularly lung transplant recipients [32] (Dr. Pasqualotto, unpublished data). Although attractive, other modern diagnostic tests have not been systematically evaluated for the diagnosis of IA in ICU patients. The use of \u03b2-D-glucan detection in ICU is hampered by false-positive readings (use of albumin, wound gauze, hemodialysis and bacterial infections) [38] . Galactomannan gives less falsepositive results, although the presence of \u03b2-lactam antibiotics such as piperacillintazobactam may pose also a problem [39] . The impact of piperacillin-tazobactam is probably reduced if GM is tested in the BAL fluid instead of sera, since the epithelial Fig. 3 Chest X-ray and CT scan from a patient on high dose steroids because of graft-versus-host disease 4 months after haematological stem cell transplantation for acute myeloid leukaemia. Chest X-ray reveals a right-sided pleural effusion and adjacent lung infiltrate. CT scan confirms a right sided complicated parapneumonic effusion, a mass filled partially with air between the 4th and 5th rib (with partial destruction of the bone) and a wedge-shaped infiltrate on the left side. In the culture specimen of the pleural fluid grew Aspergillus fumigatus. Findings are compatible with a bronchopleural fistula, secondary to rupture of a cavitating infiltrate and adjacent bone destruction Fig. 4 Chest X-ray and CT scan 2 months post kidney transplantion for end stage diabetes. Bilateral lower lobe cavities with adjacent pleural effusion on the right side are seen. Transbronchial biopsy revealed Aspergillus fumigatus. Serum and BAL galactomannan was 0.1 and 5.7 ng/ml, respectively. Despite antifungal treatment, patient died of proven Aspergillus endocarditis of the tricuspid valve lining fluid concentration of piperacillin is about half of the serum steady state concentrations [40] . Thus far, no prospective data on PCR detection are available in ICU patients, and the usefulness of combining different diagnostic test in these patients is also unknown.",

In summary, amphotericin B deoxycholate was the mainstay for the treatment of IA for a long time. However, this formulation is infamous for the occurrence of serious side effects (e.g., nephrotoxicity, hypokalemia, and infusion-related reactions). These events often result in the use of suboptimal dosing regimens. Recently voriconazole, a derivative of fluconazole, has become the new standard of care for treating IA [41] . Caspofungin, micafungin, and anidulafungin belong to a new class of antifungal drugs, the echinocandins, which act by inhibiting the synthesis of \u00df-(1,3)-D-glucan in the fungal cell wall. Echinocandins display activity against Aspergillus species, as demonstrated in several salvage studies, but convincing first-line data are still lacking.",

Patients with baseline characteristics that are commonly seen in ICU patients have usually been excluded from these studies, including those with liver function abnormalities, coagulation disorders, or renal dysfunction, and patients in need of advanced cardiovascular or pulmonary support including mechanical ventilation. Therefore, data on antifungal treatment in the ICU remain anecdotal.",

For instance, a recent study showed found nasogastric/gastric administration of voriconazole to be an independent predictor for undetectable voriconazole serum concentrations [42] . Other important questions that should be better addressed include the monitoring of drug-related toxicities, and especially drug interactions with frequently used \"ICU-drugs\".",

Its occurrence in ICU usually entails a poor prognosis despite major recent improvements in the diagnosis and treatment of IA in patients with haematological diseases. Multicenter studies are warranted to explore the exact incidence of IA in the ICU and to better delineate the difference between hospital-acquired, ICU-acquired and community-acquired aspergillosis. Evaluating the value of galactomannan, \u03b2-D-glucan and PCR in non-neutropenic critically ill patients in different sample types (and especially in respiratory samples) is urgently needed as well as a better delineation of the patient population at risk for IA in the broad group of critically ill patients. Finally, antifungal pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics and interactions with other drugs need to be explored more thoroughly. Meanwhile, all new diagnostic techniques and therapeutic measures must be validated against post-mortem findings, since only proven cases offer the most valuable information.",

Findings are compatible with the diagnosis of pneumonia. Chest CT scan was not feasible because of high FiO 2 requirements. BAL culture results were negative for bacteria and fungi (while on broad spectrum antibiotics). Galactomannan in serum was negative. Patient died and autopsy showed disseminated aspergillosis fluid samples is still a matter of debate. It has been demonstrated experimentally that the dynamics of IA result in higher and earlier release of GM in the alveoli, in comparison to the endothelial compartment",
