            "text": "The interferon-induced transmembrane proteins (IFITMs) are a family of small membrane proteins, which was induced by type I and II interferon and expressed broadly in tissues and cell lines [[13], [14], [15]]. IFITMs have diverse roles, including the control of cell proliferation, promotion of homotypic cell adhesion, protection against viral infection, promotion of bone matrix maturation and mineralization, and mediating germ cell development [16]. Recently, IFITMs were identified as broad-spectrum antiviral proteins by inhibiting the early step of virus infection, however different IFITMs has different antiviral activity [[17], [18], [19], [20], [21]]. Furthermore, there is almost no species specificity in antiviral activity of IFITMs [22,23]. For example, primate-derived IFITMs are effective inhibitors of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), and primate IFITM3 alleles also exhibit superior anti-HIV activity compared to human IFITM3 [22,24,25]. Amino-terminal mutants of primate IFITM3 are more easily incorporated into HIV virions, resulting in enhanced inhibition of HIV-1 fusion [25]. Among the IFITMs, IFITM3 was widely studied for its wide range of effective antiviral activities, which could restrict Dengue virus, SARS coronavirus, Ebola virus, HCV, influenza A virus, Zika virus, West Nile virus, and so on [[26], [27], [28], [29], [30]]. We also discovered that overexpression of human IFITM3 significantly restricted vaccinia virus infection, replication and proliferation, mainly by interfering with virus entry in a low pH-dependent manner [18].",

Firstly, IFITM3 has a broad-spectrum antiviral activity, which have been reported to inhibit entering of >20 kinds of viruses, including different subtypes of influenza virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), Ebola virus, dengue, and West Nile viruses and so on [[26], [27], [28], [29], [30],[35], [36], [37]]. Secondly, to date, IFITM3 is the only ISG discovered displaying a bona fide role in blocking virus entry, to defense virus outside the cell. Thirdly, the antiviral activity of IFITM3, in particular, is high, with the inhibition rate is up to 70% for influenza virus [30,37]. Fourthly, to date, as an endogenous molecule, IFITM3 has no immunogenicity and toxic side effect to the host cells. Finally, its molecular weight is smaller, with 133 amino acids [35], as compared to other ISGs, and is easy to be studied and applied in gene therapy and vaccine development. However, whether IFITM3 can be used as antiviral drug is still unknown.",

Thus, a suitable vector or strategy is needed to transfer the protein into the target cell. Till now, adenovirus is one of the most effective means of delivering gene in vitro and in vivo, which have been widely used in therapies for cancer, high-level, short-term expression of the target gene for gene therapy, vaccine for infection disease [1,2,5,[9], [10], [11], [12],[39], [40], [41], [42]]. In additionally, adenovirus vector is one of the most common vectors used in clinical trials, as human therapy studies based on adenovirus vector is up to 23.5% of all gene therapy trials worldwide [5]. Therefore, recombinant adenovirus was obtained by co-transfection of the linearized viral backbone vector pAd5 and the shuttle pacAd-IFITM3 containing human IFITM3 in the present study. The results showed that expression of IFITM3 did not affect the assembly and morphogenesis of progeny adenovirus, indicating that human IFITM3 has no effect on recombinant adenovirus (Fig. 2, Fig. 6, Fig. 7). Furthermore, human IFITM3 expressed by the recombinant adenovirus was increased in a time dependent manner in the cells (Fig. 4). In addition, the recombinant adenovirus can effectively express human IFITM3 in both A549 and MDCK cells (Fig. 3, Fig. 4). These results further confirmed that the recombinant adenovirus constructed in this study has a broad host range, which can be used in the future research and clinical practice.",

And, significant escalation in the dose of the recombinant adenovirus will increase the risk of inducing both direct toxicity and immune responses against the adenovirus [2]. Therefore, the MOI of rAd5-IFITM3 was determined by calculating the inhibition rate of the adenovirus on cell growth using MTS, and CPE was observed using microscopy. Based on the results in Fig. 4, Fig. 6, Fig. 7, cells infected with the recombinant adenovirus at an MOI of 100 for 24 h were selected for subsequent experiments of H5N1 infection.",

In order to evaluate antiviral efficacy, both A549 and MDCK cells infected with rAd5-IFITM3 or wtAd5 at an MOI of 100 for 24 h were challenged with H5N1 at an MOI of 1. The results showed that the expressions of viral genes in rAd5-IFITM3-treated cells were significantly inhibited at transcriptional and translational levels than that of wtAd5-treated counterparts (Fig. 8, Fig. 9), demonstrating that human IFITM3 can suppress AIV H5N1 infection in these cells. These results suggested that IFITM3 inhibited AIV H5N1 in the early stage of the infection, which was consistent with the results reported previously [[32], [33], [34]]. The in vivo utility of the present generation of rAd5-IFITM3 against H5N1 infection is in progress.",

It was reported that adenovirus or adenovirus vector induced rapid and strong innate immune response which may shorten the duration of the gene therapy and vaccination [5,45,46].
