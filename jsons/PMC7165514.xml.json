MERS\u2010CoV infection was associated with a high case fatality rate (CFR) and subsequently the CFR decreased as more patients had a milder form of the disease 3. Although many studies evaluated the clinical characteristics of MERS\u2010CoV patients, none of them addressed the temporal changes in hematologic, hepatic or creatinine values 4, 5, 6, 7. Acute renal injury was described in 92% of critically ill patients 5. However, many MERS patients had preexisting chronic renal disease 4, 8, 9. In this study, we evaluated the temporal progression and changes in hematologic, hepatic, and renal function in a cohort of patients over 21 days of hospitalization.",

To our knowledge, LDH was not examined systematically in admitted patients with MERS\u2010CoV infection. Although more MERS\u2010CoV patients had elevated LDH (47%) vs. other causes of pneumonia (29%), the difference was not statistically different 4.
