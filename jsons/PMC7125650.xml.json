The metalloprotein of hemoglobin uses an iron moiety as the binding site for oxygen and, as we are all taught in medical school, the relationship of one binding site to another causes a progressive decrease in the ability of hemoglobin to release oxygen. As oxygen leaves a heme protein, the next oxygen molecule is more tightly bound. Hemoglobin is a profound oxidizer and is highly toxic to endothelial cells as well as other tissues. In the 1930s it was thought that a \u201cblood substitute\u201d could be easily created by lysing red cells, thereby creating a stroma-free hemoglobin solution. Experiments in animals worked well for the first 12 to 24 hours, but the animals succumbed to multiple organ dysfunction and failure by 48 to 72 hours. Not only were the solutions not truly stroma free, but it was thereby proven that free hemoglobin is itself highly toxic. Endothelial cells pinocytose free hemoglobin, which leads to dramatically increased endothelial cell dysfunction exhibited as reperfusion injury and oxidative stress. Such cells, rather than being naturally anti-inflammatory, become pro-inflammatory and highly thrombotic. Evolution must therefore have favored the enclosure of hemoglobin inside of a cell envelope. If one looks at the cytosol of the erythrocyte, it contains a very high concentration of antioxidants.",

With normal 2,3 DPG the P50 or partial pressure of oxygen at which hemoglobin is 50% saturated is approximately 26 mmHg. Other metabolic byproducts have dramatic effects on the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve as well. Hydrogen ion drives the curve to the right, increasing the release of oxygen as does carbon dioxide. Acidosis, therefore, increases the movement of oxygen off of hemoglobin. Under normal conditions, because of the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve, it is possible for erythrocytes to unload at maximum 26% of their total oxygen load. For erythrocytes stored as banked blood, the maximum release of oxygen is considerably less (probably about 6% or less). The P50 of stored blood depends on how long it has been stored and the intracellular 2,3 DPG. Within 24 hours of harvest and separation, the 2,3 DPG has decreased rapidly in stored blood. By 48\u201396 hours, the levels are almost zero [7]. Unfortunately, the addition of 2,3 DPG to stored banked blood is ineffective, because the stored cells will not take up the 2,3 DPG, and plasma esterase enzymes rapidly degrade it. Once a unit of banked blood is infused, the erythrocytes rewarm and begin ATP production as well as repletion of 2,3 DPG. However, by 24 hours after transfusion, the levels are only back to slightly less than half of normal.",

The oxygen affinity of stored red cells is therefore so high that certainly they give little of their stored oxygen to tissues and may well act as an oxygen sink pulling oxygen away from plasma, normal red cells, and other sources. Within one pass through the lungs, these banked red cells will oxygenate and therefore no longer be an active sink for oxygen. But, the banked blood cells do not unload their oxygen at tissue sites.

Compensatory mechanisms for progressive euvolemic anemia include not only an increase in cardiac output (increased left ventricular emptying and tachycardia) but a change in oxygen extraction ration from the erythrocyte itself. The red cell capillary transit time increases, but a little known fact is that in striated muscle (the only place it has been studied), capillary hematocrit is stable. Capillary hematocrit value is 12% to 15% with very little variation [12].",

Standard physiology experiments have found that there is a calculated increase in oxygen delivery as euvolemic hemodilution progresses. The increase in cardiac output outstrips the relatively small decrease in oxygen-carrying capacity from a progressive loss of red cell concentration. At approximately 30% to 33% hematocrit level, the highest calculated oxygen delivery can be seen on a graph (\nFig. 1) [13]. Such a graph has often been used as justification for the 10 g/dL trigger of transfusion. Basing transfusion therapy on such a graph, however, is fraught with several fallacies and has led to probably an overly liberal use of red cell transfusions. Foremost, is the realization that the microcirculation, where the oxygen is delivered, is carefully regulated to a 12% to 15% hematocrit level, and whatever the hematocrit level is in the larger arteries may be of relatively little importance to the microcirculation except to increase blood pressure and therefore capillary driving pressure. Second, a fallacy of this argument is the widespread belief that banked blood functions as well as native red cells in delivering oxygen.",

            "text": "The concept of flow-independent and flow-dependent critical oxygen delivery is now one of the key concepts for understanding contemporary shock research. There is a flow-independent oxygen delivery in which most tissues function at most times. When either cardiac output or hematocrit level decreases sufficiently, then flow-dependent critical oxygen delivery is encountered. To the left of the critical cliff of the curve, tissues develop a progressive oxygen deficit. This is analogous to climbing Mount Everest. The longer one spends above a certain altitude, the killing zone, the more likely it is that tissue damage or death will occur. When tissues switch to flow-dependent oxygen delivery, they switch to anaerobic glycolysis with consequent lactate production and NADPH shifts. Metabolic acidosis can be the end result. The point of shift from flow-independent to flow-dependent oxygen delivery, critical oxygen delivery (DO2crit), is the ultimate definition of shock. Cardiogenic cellular hypoxia is caused by a decrease in cardiac output. Anemic cellular hypoxia is caused by loss of red cells, hemorrhage, or hemodilution. Septic shock leads to high output hypoxia in that capillaries are closed, leading to shunts and lack of oxygen delivery. Hypoxic hypoxia is caused by decreased oxygen-carrying capacity either through cellular poisoning, such as carbon monoxide, or acute respiratory failure. If one simply followed the notion that increasing oxygen-carrying capacity in the face of critical oxygen delivery improves outcome, any one of these situations should and could be helped by transfusion. Perhaps only in severe anemic hypoxia can transfusion make any difference at all.",

Biochemical, hormonal, inflammatory, and cellular structural changes all occur. Red cells change from being a normal biconcave discoid shape to globular swollen (spherocyte) and spiculated (shistocyte) shapes. Initially, by day 5 to 10 red cells get spicules on the surface of their membranes [14]. These spicules fall off, and the cells become rounded (spherocytes) but also swell and loose their flexibility. They loose approximately 15% to 20% of their cell membrane phospholipids by day 15 to 28 [14]. As the red cells survive in their anoxic environment, they loose their Na-K ATPase function, and the cells become edematous. Cellular flexibility is what allows normal erythrocytes (7-8 \u03bcm) to transit capillaries (3-5 \u03bcm). With the cell swelling and loss of lipid membrane material, red cells become very stiff and quite friable [14]. They are prone to early destruction, and, if cytokines are present, they are rapidly sequestered and have a shortened circulating half-life.",

In rat models of hemorrhagic shock, both the mesenteric blood flow and the hippocampal blood flow are reestablished with fresh blood only [15], [16]. Using stored rat blood to resuscitate hemorrhagic shock leads to only a 10% restoration of flow. In both of the noted studies, the use of stored blood restores blood pressure beautifully. Fresh blood can cause hyperemic responses in tissues because of increased oxygen delivery, but this is not seen with stored blood transfusion.

Stored erythrocytes take up oxygen and do not release it to tissues and therefore contribute to increased mixed venous oxygen levels. If practitioners use mixed venous oxygen saturation as an indicator of tissue anoxia, they may be misled. Using banked blood in transfusion mixed venous saturation rises. A natural satisfaction that a patient is better after transfusion can be the result, but this rise in mixed venous saturation might well be artifact and misleading. Today, mixed venous saturation is a highly regarded invasive measurement that has been thought to follow tissue oxygen demand and delivery. It is only when one follows tissue or systemic lactate that one can find that the tissues have slipped below DO2crit. Clearly, we wish to transfuse to avoid lactate production and slipping below critical oxygen delivery, but the important question is how to know or predict when that may happen. Work in patients after coronary artery bypass surgery grafting (CABG) surgery showed that there was no increase in oxygen delivery to the microcirculation with one or two units of blood [18]. Only with a change in the fraction of inspired oxygen did tissue oxygenation change. Therefore, the notion that one will increase oxygen delivery to tissues with transfusion has been shown to be not true in a randomized trial with real heart surgery patients. Furthermore, in some critically ill patients, it has been shown that transfusing banked blood actually decreases gut oxygen delivery making the tissues more acidotic [19], [20].",

They were never analyzed the other way around. That is to say, these studies were never examined carefully to see if patients who had more transfusions did less well, in particular, with respect to infection or immune modulation. That being said, the two trials did not have very large differences between their transfusion triggers, and knowing what we know today it might well be assumed that one would not necessarily find differences in outcomes.

Those patients who were young and who entered the intensive care unit with a relatively low Acute, Physiology, Age, Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) score had a lower mortality rate with less transfusion. Nowhere in any subgroup analysis did patients do better with more transfusions. The overall myocardial infarction (MI) rate was low, and the rate was statistically lower in those patients who were allowed to become profoundly anemic and not have a transfusion. The occurrence of ARDS and pulmonary edema were also statistically and striking lower in the group that received less blood. Of interest, there was no overall difference in infection rate in the two transfusion groups. Others have found striking differences in infection rate with perioperative transfusion. The finding here of no difference in infection rate may well be because these were medical patients in whom a large number already had infections before they had transfusions. Those data contrast to the data from elective surgery in which patients generally do not enter the operating rooms infected before a transfusion.",

MOF often is the bane of the intensivist's existence as one after another critical organ system dysfunctions and fails. The fact that MOF was more common in the group that received more transfusions may go along with some of the problems with critical oxygen delivery just discussed. Also in another subgroup analysis the investigator looked at the commonly held belief that transfusion would improve the ability for patients to be weaned from the ventilator [25]. He found exactly the opposite or at least that there were no data to support that transfusion made separation from ventilatory support any easier.

Before getting into the specific studies, one should realize the limitations of data-based analysis. These analyses are always retrospective, even if the database is collected in a prospective manner. Often the databases span a number of years with changing practice and practitioners even if only from one hospital. The data from a single practitioner might be looked on as being the \u201cbest,\u201d but often his or her surgical technique changes over time even if just from practice and maturation. Data-based research at best can find relationships between events. Cause and effect can only truly be proven by large appropriately powered prospective trials. The easiest analysis of a database is to look at a univariate analysis of a single risk factor and an outcome. However, any given risk factor may have a large number of covariates and may also have relationships to the outcome. Therefore, any relationship found by univariate analysis must be vetted with some sort of weighting of the covariate of potential confounding variables. Doing data-based research, one can either perform one of a number of multivariate analyses or a propensity analysis to control for confounders. If, after all of these statistical gymnastics are completed and a particular risk factor, such as red cell transfusion, has a relationship to an outcome, such as perioperative infection, the researcher still cannot claim cause and effect. There could always be one unsuspected and unfound covariate or confounder that was missed and was not entered into the model; therefore, that one confounder could potentially throw off any relationship. Propensity scoring is now thought to be the finest way to look statistically at relationships. It uses univariate testing to find all relationships between the primary investigated risk factor and the outcome. Other potential confounders are also investigated this way, and then multivariate analysis is used to weigh each of the potential confounders. Each patient is then examined independently and given a weighted score based on the number and type of potential confounders he or she possesses. Eventually, like patients, with matched propensity scores, are matched against each other with and without the primary risk (for example, blood transfusion). If after propensity matching the relationship of a primary risk to an outcome still exists, then the evidence is stronger but not conclusive for a cause and effect. It can also be said that the more separate data-based studies published that all find the same relationship, the evidence for cause and effect becomes more compelling. A great deal of what will be discussed next has to do with data-based publications that all agree; hence, the story is getting more compelling. It still does not prove cause and effect, because we in medicine have simply not done the right prospective, randomized trials.",

It contains high levels of a large number of different cytokines, bradykinin, serotonin, and live white cells. Leukoreduced blood has magnitudes (more than 99% reduction), fewer live white cells, and lower cytokine levels, but they do exist. A large body of literature exists showing a relationship between the infusion of red cells in transfusion and early postoperative increased rates of infection [32], [33], [34], [35], [36], [37], [38], [39], [40]. Such infections manifest as wound infections, higher pneumonia rates, dehiscence, and, in orthopedic joint replacements, osteomyelitis. It is beyond the scope of this report to examine each one of these studies carefully, and only a small number are noted for the reader. However, Vamvakas, a Canadian transfusionist has published reports from cardiac surgery databases examining the use of red cell transfusions and the risks of perioperative infection [38], [39]. He has noted that the increased risk of pneumonia is approximately 5% per unit of non\u2013white cell reduced blood. He has further gone on in other reports to note that the number of units of red cells transfused has the highest relationship to length of stay for a patient in the ICU. Other of his works have shown that transfusion to improve oxygen delivery during weaning from the respirator either does nothing or makes it more difficult to wean.

His group has published from their database with regard to both long- and short-term death rates in relationship to transfusion. In more than 1900 CABG patients followed up for 60 months, the relationship of transfusion use to death rate was shown. Those patients who had transfusion at or near the time of their operation had at least twice the death rate as those not having a transfusion, and the Kaplan-Meier survival curves continued to diverge all the way out to 5 years after surgery. Engoren was the first to carefully use propensity scoring, and he found the relationship between death and transfusion to be preserved even if full propensity matching was carried forward. The idea that this is a manifestation of the inflammatory effects of blood transfusion fits the models of what we know is important from the percutaneous cardiology intervention (PCI) literature. When coronary endothelium is made ischemic and then reperfused, it is at high risk for a period to have platelets and white cells adhere. If they do adhere, early growth and accelerated growth of atheroma or clot may result. The cardiologists know that they should now give drugs that either cut inflammation or block the adherence and propagation of platelet nidus. Perhaps the use of transfusions during the perioperative period sensitizes the endothelial cells to future adverse events. Once again, this is a hypothesis in need of prospective testing.",

Therefore, one would assume that it, as an organ, could be an early signaler of tissue hypoxia, and if we as doctors allowed the hematocrit level to get too low, then we could expect increased occurrences of renal failure. The group from Duke University examined renal failure in relationship to the lowest hematocrit (Hct) level on bypass [49]. They found a direct relationship between lowest hematocrit level and worsening serum creatinine value after heart surgery. However, when they went back to examine the effects of transfusion, they found transfusion did not improve outcome, it actually made it worse. Habib and colleagues [50], reexamined their database and similarly found that low hematocrit level was an accurate predictor of which patients would experience adverse renal function. But the use of transfusion only made it worse. Therefore, it would seem we as physicians are \u201cdamned if we do and damned if we don't.\u201d",

The database had almost 250,000 patients in it, but most were eliminated from study for one reason or another. In the end, only patients older than 65 years were segmented into different hemoglobin levels.

The group that had shown the effect had twice the number of patients with do not resuscitate (DNR) orders, more diabetics, and fewer aggressive cardiology or cardiac surgery interventions than the high Hgb groups. One has to wonder if the use of blood products, creating better mortality data, was related to a bias caused by the high number (25%) of DNR patients. No multivariate statistics were done to sort out the effect of confounders. Also, the authors paid no attention to the fact that if a patient had an Hgb of 33% or higher and had a transfusion during their evolving MI, that the mortality levels rose dramatically in relation to the transfusions. The study also has been criticized because only one Hgb level was available for each patient, and no data could relate when the transfusion was performed in relation either to the one Hgb level or the MI itself. Clearly, one should not agree with the editorial saying that at last we know when it is best to transfuse.",

This was a retrospective analysis of three cardiology trials using new antiplatelet drugs during PCIs. This database study involved more than 24,000 patients, and those patients who had transfusions during the time of PCI had almost a four-fold increase in mortality. They did multivariate analysis and propensity analysis to control for confounders and showed that transfusion was still powerfully related to increased risk for mortality. The question, therefore, remains open and in desperate need of prospective, randomized studies. We as physicians still believe that patients with known coronary artery disease should have transfusions at a higher Hgb trigger than those with normal physiology. It may well be that with the red cell storage lesions that occur in blood banking that transfusing at a higher trigger with atherosclerotic disease may not be the right thing to do.",

What can be said is that HIV and HCV are very rare but constant threats. Variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD) is capable of being transmitted by transfusion, and there certainly will be a number of emerging viral infections that will probably be found someday in the blood supply. Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) seems to possess all of the characteristics of a virus that should and could be transmitted by transfusion. The effects of other viruses such as cytomegalovirus and Epstein-Barr virus are as yet unexplored but very suspicious. The red cell storage lesions lead to decreased oxygen transport and release by banked blood compared with native red cells. Further, the changes in red cell deformability and formation of microaggregates contribute to blockage of the microcirculation by banked blood. The older the unit of blood, the worse the defects leading to a higher possibility of MOF. These effects combined with some major effects of immunomodulation lead to the end effect that patients who have more transfusions seem to have worse outcomes than those with fewer transfusions. The data-based studies cannot possibly prove cause and effect, but some recent work by epidemiologists suggest that when multivariate analysis shows a two-fold or greater increase in an adverse outcome it is most likely a causal relationship. Confounders generally have less effect than a two-fold or greater response. The data today are very sobering. A great deal of research is necessary.",
