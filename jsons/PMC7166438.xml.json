The association between influenza and bacterial pneumonia has been recognized for a long time [Morens et al., 2014]. Epidemiologic studies in the 20th century demonstrate that the incidence of pneumonia peaks with influenza activity [Stuart\u2010Harrisa et al., 1949; Tyrrell, 1952; Oswald et al., 1958].

Bacterial coinfection was probably associated with the majority of pneumonia deaths in the 1918 influenza pandemic and has been reported in up to 34% of 2009 influenza A H1N1 pandemic cases managed in ICUs; the most common pathogens in these cases are Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pneumoniae, and Streptococcus pyogenes [Chertow and Memoli, 2013]. However, even though bacterial pneumonia is a common contributor to poor outcomes, various epidemiological data suggest the incidence, severity, and the identified pathogens differ among epidemics and geographical locations. Few studies in Brazil have identified the bacteria species in patients hospitalized owing to community respiratory infections. Mauad et al. [2010] reported 21 necropsies of Brazilian patients infected by influenza A H1N1pdm; the only bacterial species isolated in three samples from nine investigated patients was S. pneumoniae. It has been suggested that there is a geographic variation of the bacterial expression of virulence factors, which could explain the observed regional differences in severity [McCullers, 2013].",

First, the diagnostic value of nasopharyngeal aspirates is questionable because pathogen detection in asymptomatic patients is relatively common [Pavia, 2013]. Nevertheless, the prevalence of coinfection differed significantly between the CRV and H1N1pdm infection groups, suggesting the bacterial positivity found in these cases could be clinically relevant. Moreover, Obasi et al. [2014] reported a significantly lower detection rate of bacteria in respiratory secretions from healthy adult than patients with acute respiratory infection. Second, only the results of molecular methods were analyzed. Thus, it is possible that bacterial and viral infections diagnosed on the basis of DNA and RNA detection overestimate the incidence of infection because it is often unfeasible to distinguish colonization from infection. Third, the presence of viral RNA could merely indicate prolonged viral detection following a previous severe respiratory tract infection. Therefore, other factors such as clinical parameters, radiographic patterns, and biomarkers should be used to predict the risk of bacterial infection [Falsey et al., 2012]. Fourth, although S. aureus is usually described in association with influenza infections, it was not evaluated in the present study because the kit used does not detect it and bacterial culture was not performed because of safety reasons. However, this pathogen is not usually identified in community respiratory infections in our region. A previous study of Brazilian patients who died from influenza A H1N1pdm pneumonia also failed to detect this species [Mauad et al., 2010].",
