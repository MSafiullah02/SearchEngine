            "text": "Results Thirty six responses were received (23%). The studied cohort consisted of 36 cases (64% female) and 17 controls (59% female). The median age was 19 years (18 -21) in the cases and 18 years (16 -27) in the control group (p = ns). Shortness of breath (SOB) was reported in 25% of the preterm cases, but nil in the control group (p = 0.044). There was a higher incidence of day/night cough (50% vs. 13%, p = 0.0135) and morning cough (37% vs. 0%, p = 0.0045) in the preterm cases compared to controls. The preterm cases were also more likely to experience a chest infection before the age of five (38% vs. 13% of controls, p = 0.046). SOB was unrelated to a history of asthma, atopy, exposure to smoke or domestic animals as there was no difference between controls and cases. Conclusion A higher incidence of SOB was reported in young adults who were born prematurely compared to sibling matched controls, and this appears to be unrelated to asthma and atopy. Further subjects will be enrolled interstate to assess predictors of respiratory symptoms in early adulthood. Background Currently all protocols for checking patient readiness for oral intake post fibre optic bronchoscopy (FOB) are non-evidence based. There is a need to establish the shortest safe time to implement resumption of oral intake following administration of local anaesthesia for various reasons. We examined return times for the gag reflex and swallow response. Method A prospective study of 100 consecutive patients presenting for a FOB, age 18-86, were assessed for optimum time to check the gag and swallow reflex. The gag was checked pre and post FOB by the touch method (tickle back of throat), swallow was checked post FOB with a sip of water at various times. Results After 1 hour 67% and 90% of patients had a gag reflex (n = 82) and swallow response (n = 100) respectively. This increased to 88% and 96% at 1\u00bd hours, 95% and 99% at 2 hours, 100% and 100% at 2\u00bd hours. The amount of sedation or length of procedure did not correlate with the return of the gag reflex or swallow response. None of the patients who swallowed with the gag still absent coughed or aspirated. Eighteen patients did not have a gag reflex pre FOB. Conclusion The gag reflex and swallow response are separate. Data shows it is possible to swallow safely without a gag reflex. The time to safe swallow is much shorter than recommended in current protocols. However, we consider it safer to allow oral intake when both reflexes are present, if the gag is present pre FOB. Otherwise the patient should wait for 1\u00bd hours post FOB as 88% have a returned gag reflex, if swallow response is also back. Nomination None.",

Reactance (X rs ), measured by forced oscillation technique has a potential role in home monitoring. The aim of this study was to determine within-and between-day repeatability of resistance (R rs ), X rs , and spirometry in stable COPD subjects. Methods Ten COPD subjects underwent seven consecutive home visits consisting of three measures of FOT (1 minute recording) and spirometry before and after 200 mcg ventolin via spacer. Results Subject characteristics Mean (SD) -Age 74.7 years (7.43), smoking history 48.6 pack years (17.3), post-BD (post-bronchodilator) FEV1 51.1% predicted (16.3), FEV1/FVC ratio 0.4 (0.11). Repeatability measures are reported as intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC) and SD of within subject variance (Sw). Introduction Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the single most important risk factor for lung cancer (affecting 50-90% of those diagnosed). Considerable overlap exists between smokers who develop COPD and/or lung cancer, suggesting involvement of shared pathogenic pathways (inflammation, matrix remodeling and cell death). In a prospective study of high and low risk smokers we have combined SNPs from GWAS and candidate gene studies to develop a susceptibility score for lung cancer (LCSS).",

            "text": "Conclusion In this prospective study, we show that the LCSS identifies those at greatest risk of lung cancer who might benefit from aggressive preventive strategies such as cessation and chemoprevention. The author is not aware of any conflict of interest. Malignant mesothelioma (MM) remains an incurable cancer and its global incidence is rising rapidly. Alternative therapeutic strategies are therefore required. Bacterial products have been trialled in an effort to enhance local immunity and have demonstrated tumouricidal activity. Staphylococcal enterotoxins (SE) are classic models of superantigens that have potent mitogenic activity on T cells and demonstrated anti-tumour effects in several cancer models. Intrapleural delivery of staphylococcal enterotoxin C (SEC) has been used in China for many years as a pleurodesing agent. However, it is unknown whether SEC actually kills cancer cells. In this study, we examined the efficacy of SEC in the treatment of MM. SEC was added at various concentrations (0-10 ng/ml) to several human and murine MM cell lines and a human benign mesothelial cell line in vitro. Dose dependant cytotoxicity was observed in all cell lines resulting in a significant reduction in viability at higher doses (10 ng/ml) when using trypan blue exclusion and WST-1 assays (0.001 < p < 0.05). In an effort to elucidate the mechanism of action of SEC, annexin V staining and flow cytometry were used to measure apoptosis. Results demonstrated a significant increase in apoptosis in MM cells when treated with SEC compared to untreated controls (0.001 < p < 0.05). On the contrary, benign mesothelial cells appeared to be resistant to the apoptotic effects of SEC at equivalent concentrations (p > 0.05). ELISA based assays were used to examine cytokine profiles in culture supernatants of SEC treated MM cells and benign mesothelial cells. Levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL-8 decreased in SEC treated MM cells (0.001 < p < 0.01) compared to a significant increase in levels observed in benign mesothelial cells (0.01 < p < 0.05). These results suggest that SEC kills MM cells in vitro with some specificity and its activity against MM in vivo warrants investigation.",

Age differences in stage distribution remained significant in multivariable analysis controlling for gender, rural residence, and socioeconomic status. Among the other characteristics, only gender differences in stage was significant, with stage I cancer being more common in women compared to men (34% vs. 29%, p = 0.02). Australia has the world's highest incidence of mesothelioma, a disease which has no proven effective therapy. The median survival of less than 12 months and five year survival of 5% have not changed in two decades. Radical resection has a high attrition rate with most cases recurring locally, and few patients have durable responses to chemotherapy. Symptoms are related to local disease which compresses the lung and causes severe chest pain from enlarging tumour masses. Aim To improve local control of mesothelioma by high dose radiotherapy using advanced technologies that precisely define the active tumour and reduce toxicity to normal tissues. Methods All patients had 18 FDG PET scans co-registered with a simulation CT scan to define the target volume, and follow-up PET scans were analysed to assess the residual total glycolytic volumes (TGV) after radiotherapy.

            "text": "Results See Table 1 -to be updated. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a useful modality for assessing chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) before pulmonary endarterectomy (PEA). Cardiac MRI provides more accurate right ventricular (RV) data than echocardiography. MR angiography demonstrates vascular changes reliably to a segmental level and MR perfusion shows disease distribution. Aim To examine the relationship between changes in MRI parameters with clinical and haemodynamic outcomes post-PEA. Methods RV end-diastolic volume (RVEDV), RV ejection fraction (RVEF), vessel abnormalities and lobar perfusion defects were determined with MRI before and after PEAs performed during [2004] [2005] [2006] [2007] . Changes in New York Heart Association (NYHA) functional class, six minute walk distance (6MWD), mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP) and cardiac output (CO) were collected retrospectively from patient charts. Results Nineteen patients assessed pre-PEA were of mean \u00b1 SD age 57 \u00b1 12 years, NYHA class 2.8 \u00b1 0.7, 6MWD 414 \u00b1 103 metre and mPAP 42\u00b110 mmHg. Immediately post-PEA, mPAP fell by 13 \u00b1 7 mmHg which was related to changes in RVEDV of 26 \u00b1 15% (r 2 = 0.38, p = 0.006). At 6-12 months post-PEA, 6MWD improvement (115 \u00b1 99 metre) was related to changes in RVEF of 28\u00b149% (r 2 = 0.40, p = 0.007) but angiographic changes had a weak relationship with NYHA class shift (r 2 = 0.22, p = 0.034). Perfusion generally improved after PEA relating weakly with RVEDV (r 2 = 0.3, p = 0.032) but not clinical outcomes. Conclusions This study shows that improvements in MRI parameters (RV data more than angiographic findings) after PEA correspond to clinical and haemodynamic outcomes. We have demonstrated a useful imaging test for monitoring patients post-PEA with no radiation exposure. Purpose Allergic reactions to antibiotics are very common in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients and can complicate treatment in patients with multi-or pan-resistant bacterial species. We hypothesised that post-transplant immunosuppression may reduce the requirement for desensitisation. Methods and Materials A retrospective review was performed in June 2009 to detect prescribing practices and any changes in allergy patterns before and following lung transplantation in CF. Since antibiotic desensitisation has not been used post-transplant at our institution, our aim was to review our experience with antibiotic rechallenge, without desensitisation, in the post-transplant setting. Results Fifty eight CF patients, 34 (58%) female, aged 34 years, range 15-50 years, 3 heart-lung, 3 heart-lung liver have undergone transplantation at our institution. 36 (62%) had a pre-transplant history of IgE (angioedema -8%) or non-IgE (e.g. rash, nausea, arthralgia or liver dysfunction -92%) mediated reactions to at least one antibiotic (29 % penicillin, 21 % cephalosporin, 13 % carbapenem, 9% aztreonam and 28% others). Desensitization to antibiotics with non IgE mediated reaction was attempted in 9 out of the 36 patients pre-transplant and successful on all occasions. In 27 other patients, alternative antibiotics were selected and desensitisation was not required. After transplantation, 18 (50%) patients with non IgE mediated reactions were rechallenged without desensitisation on 25 occasions. No life-threatening reactions were observed. Only two episodes required antibiotic cessation and both recovered without incident. New onset of adverse reaction to IV colistin and voriconazole occurred in two patients following transplantation. Conclusions Cautious antibiotic rechallenge can be successfully achieved without desensitisation in the majority of patients who have had non IgE mediated allergic phenomena to the same compound prior to transplantation. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is characterised by marked collagen deposition. The receptor subunit gp130 has been associated with the progression of fibrosis. The interleukin (IL)-6 family of cytokines all require gp130 to initiate signal transduction to activate either the extracellular regulated kinase (ERK) or signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) pathways. The IL-6 family of cytokines consist of IL-6, IL-11, oncostatin M (OSM), leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF), cardiotrophin-1 (CT-1), ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF), IL-27 and IL-31. Previous studies performed in our laboratory have demonstrated that exaggerated gp130-STAT3 signalling is fundamental to the development of bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis in a murine model. We hypothesise that pulmonary fibrosis is mediated by IL-6 family cytokine/gp130-STAT1/3 signalling. The aim of the current study was to identify which of the IL-6 family cytokines are important in the development of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis. Bleomycin or control saline was administered intranasally to individual IL-6 knockout (IL-6 -/-) mice and dual IL-6 and IL-11 a-receptor knockout (IL-6 -/-;IL-11aR -/-) mice. Collagen production was examined by histology and HPLC in lung tissue 30 days post treatment. No significant increase in collagen was observed in bleomycin treated IL-6 -/or IL-6 -/-;IL-11aR -/mice implicating a role for IL-6 in the development of pulmonary fibrosis. Interestingly, the histology of IL-6 -/-;IL-11aR -/mice displayed marked emphysema which was not observed in individual IL-6 -/mice suggesting this is an IL-11-mediated response. The role of IL-6 family cytokines in proliferation, myofibroblast differentiation and collagen expression were examined using fibroblasts isolated from wildtype (wt) and genetically engineered mice containing point mutations to prevent gp130-ERK1/2 signalling (gp130 757F ) or gp130-STAT1/3 signalling (gp130 STAT ). Overall, there was no significant increase in proliferation 48 hours post cytokine stimulation as assessed by WST-1 reagent. IL-6 and IL-11 did not stimulate a-SMA or collagen expression above control, measured by real time PCR. In conclusion, increasing evidence suggests that IL-6 plays an important role in the development of bleomycininduced pulmonary fibrosis but this does not appear to be induced by direct effects of IL-6 on fibroblast proliferation, differentiation or collagen production.",

            "text": "Mannose binding lectin (MBL) is a key mediator of innate immunity and efferocytosis (clearance of apoptotic cells) and is thus important in protecting against tissue damage. Reduced MBL is implicated in airways disease including infection, COPD and BOS, however, 'normal' plasma levels of MBL are highly variable due genetic polymorphisms complicating correlation with disease processes. We have previously shown reduced MBL and defective efferocytosis in BAL from patients with post-transplant BOS, but there are conflicting reports of the link between low plasma MBL levels, increased complement activation and graft rejection. To compare MBL levels in the peripheral blood and BAL compartments, we investigated MBL in paired plasma and BAL from 46 lung transplant recipients (10 stable; 32 stable with infection, 7 with lymphocytic bronchiolitis and 10 with BOS) and in plasma from 10 and BAL from 17 controls. In plasma, MBL levels were highly variable. No significant differences were noted among the transplant groups although levels were significantly reduced in all transplant patients vs. controls. There was no correlation between MBL and time post-transplant or pre-transplant diagnosis. In BAL, MBL levels were less variable and significantly reduced in patients with BOS (MBL ng/ml: Controls: 6.2 \u00b1 1; stable 8.6 \u00b1 3.8; stable infected 10.7 \u00b1 2.7; BOS 2.2 \u00b1 1.7). Interestingly, in all patients with LB, MBL levels were very low in both plasma (mean 35.8 ng/ml) and BAL (3 ng/ml). Low levels of MBL in the airway may play a role in reduced efferocytosis, leading to tissue damage and airways disease post-transplant. In normal subjects, external dead space with exercise is associated with a slower deeper breathing pattern compared at the same ventilation. With simulated lung restriction and constant intensity exercise, we tested the hypothesis that dead space combined with reduced exercise intensity to match ventilation, would alter pattern of breathing, reduce Inspiratory Reserve Volume (IRV) and thus increase dyspnea. Methods Eleven healthy male subjects, aged 28(8) (SD) years completed separate visits with (a) no restriction and (b) chest wall strapping to reduce FVC by 30 (7) Introduction Glossopharyngeal breathing (GPB) is used by competitive breath-hold divers to increase lung gas content above TLC to improve performance. This occurs by both lung expansion and gas compression. Whilst GPB is known to induce hypotension and tachycardia, little is known about the changes that occur to both the pulmonary circulation and the structural integrity of the thorax. The aim of this study was to investigate these changes within an elite cohort.",

In contrast, no changes were seen in the conductance or distensibility profiles in the control group. Post-BD distensibility in asthma remained reduced compared to controls. Conclusion Using a sensitive method for determining conductance and distensibility profiles, we found that both conductance and distensibility are reduced in asthma across a range from low to high lung volumes.

We propose that in asthma the remaining deficit in distensibility after BD will provide unique insight into to altered airway mechanical function due to airway remodelling.

Background Asthma shows varying levels of resistance to effective treatment by glucocorticoids.

Treatment of A549 cells with SB431542, a TGFb receptor type I kinase inhibitor, restored the Dex inhibitory effect on IL-8 release (from control 17 \u00b1 7% to 45 \u00b1 7%, inhibition in SB431542 1 lM, n = 9; p < 0.05). In A549 cells transfected with a glucocorticoid response element (GRE)-driven reporter gene, TGFb (40 pM) inhibited the GRE response to Dex (0.1-1000 nM) by more than 80%. In addition, TGF-b impaired Dex regulation of the GRE-dependent gene, IjB. PGE2 plays a protective role in asthma by inhibiting airway inflammation. It is predominantly produced by epithelial cells in response to pro-inflammatory stimuli and acts as an autocrine and paracrine mediator. Prostanoids have been shown to regulate expression of enzymes involved in their metabolism, as well as expression of their receptors and that regulation is tissue-and cell-specific. Despite its importance, however, mechanisms underlying the regulation of expression of enzymes involved in PGE2 metabolism and its receptors in human lung epithelial cells have remained elusive. Therefore, we hypothesised that PGE2 regulates expression of PGE2 synthase 1 (PGES1) and its receptors (E Prostanoid (EP) 1-4) in human airway epithelial cells.",

Monocyte derived Dendritic Cells (DCs) have been recognised for their potential role in immune responses and their functional relevance with regard to adaptive immune responses although more detailed knowledge of DC biology in human airways is required. The objective of this study was to modify the monocyte derived DCs from peripheral blood and direct the cells via exposure to pro-inflammatory conditions as seen in COPD, with a view to identifying novel targets for cellular therapy. We characterised monocyte-derived DCs in culture and evaluated the effects of human rhinovirus infected bronchial epithelial cells, pI:C (polyinosine-polycytidytic acid) and BC (bacterial extract) on directing DC differentiation and maturation in culture. We found an impaired adaptive immune response, and in particular, an impaired CD8 effector cell function in COPD patients. Our DC culture results showed that both MHC-I and MHC-II expression on DCs from COPD were significantly down regulated compare to healthy controls, which could affect MHC restricted Ag presentation, and lead to a failure to activate responder T cells. Furthermore, we tested the capability of monocyte-precursors to differentiate into functional DCs. Only a very small percentage of cultured monocytes from patients with COPD was capable of differentiating into mature DCs, compared with healthy controls. During DC activation, there was up-regulation of co-stimulatory (CD80/86) and maturation markers (MHCs), enabling DC to activate na\u00efve T cells in mixed lymphocyte culture both in COPD patients and healthy controls. Our preliminary data indicated that this activation leads to the generation of effector T cells, further study is needed. Defective DC activation of T cells may underlie poor T cell responsiveness in COPD in response to inflammation and may, in part, determine the response to therapy. Our data suggest a promising role in vitro for pharmacologic treatment as a means of generating functional DCs and will further stimulate speculation regarding their potential clinical application.

IgG levels were negatively correlated with age (r 2 = 0.20, p = 0.03). Multivariate logistic regression models identified IgA deficiency as independently associated with BOS (p = 0.04), while the association of IgG deficiency with BOS was explained by interaction between BOS, age and COPD.

            "text": "Conclusions Our study provides further evidence that the release of soluble mediators from activated mast cells can induce cytokine production from hASM cells. Further work is currently ongoing to identify the factor/s responsible for this effect. We have previously demonstrated that gp130-mediated STAT3 signaling is required for bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis in mice. To determine the role of phosphorylated STAT3 (pSTAT3) in the development of human lung fibrosis we examined STAT3 and the regulation of STAT3 expression in lung tissue from idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) patients. Immunohistochemistry revealed nuclear localization of pSTAT3 in fibroblastic cells within fibrotic foci. Suppressor of Cytokine Signaling-3 (SOCS3) is a known negative regulator of gp130-induced STAT3 activation. We tested the hypothesis that reduced SOCS3 expression may account for elevated pSTAT3 in cells within the fibroblastic foci of IPF lungs. RT 2 PCR Profiler analysis of the JAK/STAT pathway demonstrated that IL-6 up-regulated SOCS3 mRNA in both IPF and HLF. Western blot analysis confirmed that SOCS3 expression was not aberrant in these cells, although a trend towards reduced SOCS3 expression was evident. Our analysis identified six JAK-STAT pathway associated genes that were significantly altered in IPF cells following IL-6 exposure for 30 minutes but of those, only IL-20 was up-regulated. Examination of other known regulators of STAT signaling including SOCS1, SOCS2, SOCS4, SOCS5, PIAS1, PIAS3 and protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 1 (PTPN1) was performed but only SOCS1 expression was reduced in IPF. In summary, dysregulation of SOCS3 does not appear to cause high STAT3 levels in IPF tissue but the potential regulation by SOCS1 is the subject of ongoing investigations. The phosphoinositide 3 kinase (PI3K) signal transduction pathway contributes to the airway remodelling associated with asthma; however, the precise roles of the specific PI3K isoforms are currently unknown. In this study, we investigated the roles of the class IA PI3K isoforms p110a, p110b and p110d in airway smooth muscle (ASM) cells derived from asthmatic subjects and ASM cells and lung fibroblasts from non-asthmatic subjects.",

Background Carrier screening for CF has been available for many years but there is no national program for population-based screening in Australia. Knowledge of Australian CF healthcare professionals' attitudes towards carrier screening would provide useful information about how a program could be implemented. The aim of this study was to investigate the attitudes of CF respiratory physicians and CF clinic coordinators in Australia towards population-based carrier screening for CF. Method A purposed designed questionnaire assessing knowledge and attitudes towards CF carrier screening was distributed to respiratory physicians and CF clinic coordinators throughout Australia. Results There were 111 respiratory physicians registered with the CF special interest group of TSANZ and 30 CF clinic nurses identified through the CF coordinators network. Seventy-five responded, 55 respiratory physicians (49.5%) and 20 coordinators (67%). Forty-two (56%) respondents were in favour of population-based carrier screening for CF. Sixty-four (85%) rated raising a child with CF as difficult/very difficult, 63 (84%) rated the shortened life span as a significant concern and 64 (85%) the daily treatment regimen as a significant concern. Disadvantages of screening were perceived anxiety amongst carriers (n = 65, 87%) and discrimination of carriers (n = 42, 56%). Respondents rated the following barriers as most important: limitations of predicting clinical outcomes (n = 47, 65%) and insufficient time and resources for providers (n = 45, 61%). Fifty-four (76%) of respondents believed they had a role in the development of a CF carrier screening program. Adherence to medication regimens in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) vary substantially. Direct measures of adherence using electronic monitors attached to medication bottles enable the precise recording of usage. The macrolide antibiotic, azithromycin has demonstrated clinical benefit when used in CF patients with moderate to severe impairment of lung function. Aim This study compares the adherence levels of CF patients randomised to two different treatment regimens of azithromycin, measured by electronic monitoring. Methods Patients were prescribed the medication once (1000 mg) or three times (500 mg) a week. Data were collected over 24 weeks using electronic monitoring devices. Adherence measures were defined as: Total adherence (total amount of medication taken divided by total medication prescribed) and total number of days adhered (number of days where prescribed doses were taken divided by number of days monitored).",

Results The 6 minute walk distance (6MWD) and the incremental shuttle walk distance (ISWD) were significantly greater on the 2nd test (both p < 0.02). The mean (95% CI) increase in the 6MWD was 22 m (9 to 35 m); 4% (2 to 7%) and in the ISWD was 22 m (4 to 39 m); 6% (2 to 10%).

Methods Employees of three metropolitan teaching hospitals (Royal Adelaide -RAH, Flinders Medical Centre -FMC and TQEH) and the Alice Springs Hospital (ASH) were sent a single page questionnaire asking about smoking status and views about smoking on campus. Returns were voluntary but encouraged via a small monetary prize. TQEH was surveyed thrice (1997, 2002 and 2007) , the other hospitals were surveyed once (late 2004/ early 2005) .",

            "text": "Conclusions Our findings suggest that EMT is active in smokers, and is most evident in current smokers with COPD, suggesting a role in COPD pathogenesis. Pulmonary emphysema is a major component of the Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), and also predisposes affected individuals to lung cancer. Emphysema can be a familial or acquired disease, with the great variation in development of disease in atrisk populations reflecting the influence of other susceptibility determinants. In this regard, the IL-6 cytokine family has been linked with emphysema pathogenesis. However, studies into the definitive mechanisms by which these cytokines cause emphysema have been hampered by the absence of informative animal disease models. To address this issue, we have utilized a sophisticated animal model (gp130 F/F mice) with a subtle mutation in the IL-6 cytokine family receptor gp130 which, as a consequence of abolishing binding of both SHP2 and SOCS3, simultaneously mediates STAT1/3 hyper-activation and impaired SHP2-MAPK and -PI3K activation. The gp130 F/F mice spontaneously develop emphysema by 6 months of age characterized by increased static compliance. Lung Stereology has further confirmed emphysematous changes, revealing increases in volumes of airspace and lung. Among the IL-6 cytokine family, IL-6 expression is significantly up-regulated in the lungs of gp130 F/F mice, and genetic ablation of IL-6 in gp130 F/F mice prevents the development of emphysema. Notably, an increased apoptosis of alveolar cells has been identified as the underlying cellular mechanism associated with the emphysema in gp130 F/F mice. Collectively, our observations identify for the first time that deregulated gp130 signalling by IL-6 cause's alveolar cells to undergo apoptosis, which coincide with the pathogenesis of emphysema. Furthermore, this mouse model has the enormous potential to allow us to explore common mechanistic links between COPD and lung cancer.",

            "text": "Conclusions We have identified multiple gene ontologies associated with COPD severity. These targets have promising biological roles in COPD and can be further developed as biomarkers or therapeutic targets. Cigarette smoke (CS)-induced oxidative stress is known to drive the pathogenesis of COPD. The antioxidant glutathione (GSH) is essential for efficient macrophage functions including phagocytosis of apoptotic cells (efferocytosis) which we have shown to be defective in COPD. GSH synthesis is controlled by a CD98/xCT cysteine transporter pathway. CD98 is also a ligand for galectin-3 (gal-3), a lectin important for macrophage phagocytosis and GSH synthesis. We hypothesised that targeting oxidative stress in COPD by increasing GSH would increase gal-3 levels and improve efferocytosis. We investigated (a) Ex vivo: oxidative stress markers (8-isoprostane; MMP9), GSH and gal-3 in BAL from 20 controls and 14 current-and 13 ex-smoker COPD subjects (b) In vitro: the effects of CS on alveolar macrophage production of gal-3 and GSH (c) In vivo: the effects of treatment with a GSH precursor, Procysteine, on efferocytosis, gal-3 and GSH in smokeexposed mice. Procysteine was administered in semi-solid mouse feed. Efferocytosis was investigated in lung tissue and BAL macrophages. 8-isoprostane and MMP9 were significantly increased in BAL in current-and ex-smokers with COPD. GSH and gal-3 were decreased in COPD (Gal-3, ng/mL: current 0.66 \u00b1 0.11, ex-smoker 0.96 \u00b1 0.26 vs. controls 3.0 \u00b1 0.62). In vitro CS treatment decreased gal-3 expression. In vivo, CS caused decreased efferocytosis that was significantly improved by Procysteine (Control; smokeexposed; Procysteine + smoke-exposed: BAL 26.2%; 17.66%; 27.8%; Tissue 35.9%; 21.6%; 34.5 %). GSH and gal-3 were also significantly increased by Procysteine (Gal-3, ng/ml: control 1.74 \u00b1 0.21; smoke-exposed 0.26 \u00b1 0.042; Procysteine + smoke-exposed 1.26 \u00b1 0.29 ng/ml).

About 75% of OB cases were notified within 1 year of arrival. 30 of the Australianborn cases were close household contacts of an adult TB case. About 18 cases had culture confirmed disease (15 fully sensitive to first line drugs, one multidrug resistant). 70% had pulmonary and 23% had lymph node TB. About 82 cases completed the treatment, two were lost to follow-up and one died. Compared to adult TB cases, children were more likely to be refugees (OR 2.1 (CI 1.1-3.7)), diagnosed on contact screening (OR 14.4 (7.9-25.8)), have lymphatic TB (OR 2.54 (CI 1.5-4.3)), and less likely to be culture-confirmed (OR .07 (CI .04-.12)). The PNG child visitors' cases diagnosed in Queensland had a higher level of severe and culture-confirmed disease. Conclusion Queensland has a very low burden of childhood TB, indicating low levels of TB transmission in the community.

Introduction Airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR) is a characteristic feature of asthma. In young asthmatics, severity of AHR is related to exhaled nitric oxide (eNO), a marker of eosinophilic airway inflammation, and ventilation heterogeneity in the conducting airways (Scond). With increasing age, eosinophilic inflammation decreases and ventilation heterogeneity in the very peripheral, acinar, airways worsens. Aim To determine if the predictors of AHR differ in young and older asthmatics. Methods About 61 young (18-46) and 41 older (50-80) asthmatic subjects underwent baseline spirometry, body plethysmography, eNO, multiple breath nitrogen washout (MBNW), and methacholine (MCh) challenge. AHR was expressed as dose response slope (DRS = %fall FEV1/lmol MCh). Ventilation heterogeneity of the conducting (Scond) and acinar (Sacin) airways were calculated from the MBNW. Predictors of AHR in each group were determined by multiple linear regression. Results Compared to younger asthmatics, older asthmatics had lower values of eNO, less severe AHR, worse acinar heterogeneity; however there were no differences in Scond values. In younger asthmatics, AHR was predicted by FEV1/FVC (partial r 2 = 0.29), eNO (partial r 2 = 0.13) and Scond (partial r 2 = 0.06) (overall r 2 = 0.48, p < 0.0001). In older asthmatics, AHR was predicted by RV % predicted (partial r 2 = 0.29), Sacin (partial r 2 = 0.17) and FEV1 % predicted (partial r 2 = 0.05) (overall r 2 = 0.51, p < 0.0001). Conclusions The predictors of AHR are different in young and old asthmatics. In older asthmatics, eNO is not a significant predictor of AHR, which may reflect the changing inflammatory profile associated with aging. The association between AHR and both RV and Sacin suggests that AHR in older asthmatics is determined by abnormalities in very peripheral airways. Introduction In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we sought to establish if maternal asthma is associated with an increased risk of adverse perinatal outcomes associated with size at birth and timing of birth. Methods Electronic databases were searched for the following terms: (asthma or wheeze) and (pregnan* or perinat* or obstet*). Cohort studies published between 1975 and March 2009 were considered for inclusion. 103 articles were identified, and 40 publications involving 1,637,180 subjects met the inclusion criteria, by reporting at least one perinatal outcome in pregnant women with and without asthma. Meta-analysis was conducted with subgroup analyses by study design and active asthma management. Results Maternal asthma was associated with an increased risk of low birth weight (relative risk [RR] 1.46, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.22, 1.75), small for gestational age (SGA, RR 1.22, CI 1.14, 1.31), very SGA (RR 1.27, CI 1.18, 1.37), significantly reduced mean birth weight (weighted mean difference -93 g, CI -169, -25 g), and reduced risk of high birth weight (RR 0.84, CI 0.74, 0.95). Maternal asthma was associated with an increased risk of preterm labor (RR 1.71, CI 1.14, 2.57), early preterm labor (RR 1.93, CI 1.58, 2.34) and preterm delivery (RR 1.41, CI 1.22, 1.61). The risk for preterm labor and delivery was reduced to a non-significant level in those studies reporting active management of asthma during pregnancy (RR 0.95, CI 0.73, 1.26; RR 1.07, CI 0.991, 1.26). Conclusion Pregnant women with asthma are at increased risk of perinatal complications which affect the baby's size and timing at birth. Active asthma management may reduce the risk of preterm labor and delivery.",

A response rate of 81% (n = 95 hospitals) yielded 189 surveys for analysis. Results Most physiotherapists (65%) prescribe ACTs for 60-100% of patients with AE-COPD, with 90% of ACT treatments lasting 5-20 minutes.

Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and its relative human Metapneumovirus (hMPV) are associated with acute graft dysfunction, although limited data exists on the subsequent risk of BOS and survival longer term. Our aim was to describe the long term outcome of a hMPV and RSV cohort from a single institution. Methods and Materials Lung transplant patients between January 2002 and March 2008 with symptoms of respiratory viral infection underwent nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA). Individuals with hMPV or RSV and allograft dysfunction received a minimum of7 days intravenous ribavirin and pulse steroids. Intragam (human immunoglogulin, CSL) was reserved for intractable graft dysfunction. Results Fifty-one patients had 459 visits for NPA studies with 58 samples (12.7%) PCR positive for RSV n = 34 and hMPV n = 24. Fourteen patients experienced mild upper respiratory tract symptoms only. Median decline in FEV1 relative to baseline for hMPV at followup 27.5 \u00b1 15 months was 1.8% (-7.47-2.59, CI), compared with 11% (-13.85-4.68, CI, p < 0.05) for RSV at followup 23.6 \u00b1 16. There was no significant effect on time for BOS 1 to BOS 3 progression or survival compared with the non viral cohort n = 114. Kaplan-Meier BOS free probability for the RSV and hMPV group confirmed no difference from the non viral cohort (p = 0.559 and 0.777 respectively.

AMERIOLATION OF MONOCROTALINE INDUCED PULMONARY ARTERIAL HYPERTENSION BY TARGETED UPREGULATION OF BONE MORPHOGENETIC PROTEIN RECEPTOR TYPE-2 IN THE PULMONARY ENDOTHELIUM ANN M REYNOLDS 1 , MARK D HOLMES 1 , NICHOLAS W MORELL 2 , SERGEI DANILOV 3 , PAUL N REYNOLDS 1 1 Department of Thoracic Medicine, Royal Adelaide Hospital, Hanson Institute, Adelaide, SA, Australia, 2 University of Cambridge, Cambridge, UK, and 3 University of Illinois at Chicago, USAMutations in the bone morphogenetic protein receptor type 2 (BMPR2) are implicated in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Thus, gene therapy using a normal BMPR2 gene could be therapeutic. We previously developed a unique system for the upregulation of pulmonary endothelial BMPR2 gene expression in rats using adenoviral (Ad) vectors linked to a pulmonary endothelial targeting conjugate (Fab-9B9), and showed that this ameliorated hypoxia-induced PAH. The development of vascular inflammation and remodelling following monocrotaline (MCT) administration is an alternative well-established animal model of PAH. We hypothesised that our novel treatment could reverse PAH in response to MCT. Methods Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned to three groups (two MCT injected and one saline control). Ten days after MCT, rats were a given tail vein injection of AdTracLuc (irrelevant viral control) or AdBMPR2, each with Fab-9B9. After a further 8-10 days, PAH was assessed. Results Numbers in parenthesis indicate % difference. Compared to MCT treated rats that received control vector, those receiving BMPR2 gene delivery had significantly lower right ventricular systolic pressures (36%), lower pulmonary vascular resistance (47%), less right ventricular hypertrophy (21%) and improved cardiac output (21%) and cardiac index (25%) (P < 0.05, ANOVA and Holm-Sidak multiple comparison test). Conclusion In our in vivo model system, over-expression of pulmonary endothelial BMPR2 ameliorated further development of MCT-induced pulmonary hypertension, suggesting this approach may have value in PAH secondary to inflammatory vascular remodelling.

We have previously demonstrated that the concentration of respiratory bacterial pathogens in sputum is associated with acute exacerbation frequency and airway inflammation. We aimed to determine if regular azithromycin would reduce acute exacerbation frequency and health care utilisation in this setting. Methods A randomised placebo-controlled trial of one year of weekly supervised 1 g azithromycin in 105 adult ( \u202118 years) Indigenous Australians with COPD (FEV1 <80% pred and FEV1/FVC ratio <0.7, <12% improvement with bronchodilators, no evidence of bronchiectasis) living in nine remote communities in the northern 'Top end' of the Northern Territory. Endpoints included self-reported acute exacerbations (AE) and respiratory and all cause health care utilisation. Results Five hundred and thirteen remote residents were screened with 105 enrolled in the trial. Randomisation was successful. Weekly azithromycin was not associated with any difference in self-reported acute exacerbation frequency and respiratory and all cause health care utilisation overall both on an intention-to-treat basis and when controlling for adherence. The study had a power of 76% to detect a halving of AE frequency with azithromycin.Conclusions We have not shown any benefit from long-term azithromycin for Indigenous Australians with COPD. Despite limited numbers the study had sufficient power to detect a clinically significant effect. The priorities for dealing with the burden COPD places on Indigenous Australian health should be addressing poverty, housing and tobacco, ensuring vaccination coverage, and high quality, accessible and appropriate diagnosis (especially spirometry) and management of established disease.

We examined the associations between adult onset asthma and occupational exposures in a population-based cohort. Methods Participants in the Tasmanian Longitudinal Health Study (TAHS) have been followed from 7 (n = 8583) to 44 years of age. Occupational histories were obtained from 1592 subjects at the age of 44. Occupations were linked to an asthma-specific Job Exposure Matrix with additional expert judgment of exposure to 18 high-risk substances. Adult onset asthma was defined by a positive response to asthma specific questions at 44 years, with no asthma reported by parents at ages 7 or 14. Odds Ratios (OR and 95% confidence intervals) were estimated in SPSS. Results There were 290 subjects with adult onset asthma, which was significantly associated with occupational exposure to latex (OR 1.78, 95% CI 1.16-2.75) and reactive cleaning or disinfecting products (1.52, 1.03-2.24). Negative associations were seen for exposure to combustion particles or exhaust fumes (0.58, 0.39-0.86) and high probability of accidental peak exposures to irritants (0.51, 0.27-0.97). No associations were identified for other well-described causes of occupational asthma such as isocyanates, agricultural antigens or wood dust. Conclusions There is an increased risk of adult onset asthma associated with occupational exposures to latex and cleaning or disinfecting products.

We sought to study the disease distribution and cause of death in two cohorts exposed to predominantly crocidolyte (WA) vs. chrysotile (UK) asbestos. Methods We interrogated the Western Australia (WA) mesothelioma registry and Bristol (UK) Coroner's reports for post-mortem (PM) records of confirmed MPM cases. Results Despite different asbestos exposures, the two cohorts were very similar in demographics, rates of histological subtype and extent of disease. A total of 318 complete PM records were identified(WA 169, UK 149). 300 (94.3%) were male, with a mean (SD) age of 68.4 (11.5) years, and predominantly (56%) right sided tumour. Distant metastases were very common, affecting 59.7% of patients. An anatomical cause of death was established in only 92 (28.9%) cases. Pulmonary embolus (PE) contributed to death in 13 (4.1%) cases. In the Western Australia cohort, median survival from diagnosis was significantly shorter in the sarcomatoid group despite no significant difference in rates of distant metastases(Table 1).Table 1. Histological Subtype, Distant Metastases and Survival in MPM.Conclusion To our knowledge, this is the largest post-mortem series of metastases in MPM in English literature. We found that distant metastases were common and sarcomatoid MPM has a significantly poorer prognosis.

Tailings from the mine were distributed and used extensively throughout the town. Exposure to children also occurred from the laundering of workers clothes at home. Earlier work has shown a lower risk of malignant mesothelioma (MM) in children from Wittenoom than in those exposed to blue asbestos as adults.A case report of a 69 year old ex-forestry worker with an 80 pack year smoking history is presented. He was referred with two distinct periods of hemoptysis, one 7 months prior to referral for which he declined investigation or follow up, and another three weeks prior to referral. On each occasion, he described two tablespoons of hemoptysis daily lasting approximately 1 month. He lives on an acreage at Mt Kilcoy, 94 km north of Brisbane, with his wife, one goat, three dogs, one cat, 51 deer and wild birds. Emphysema manifesting as gradually worsening exertional dyspnoea with wheeze, had been diagnosed years ago by his local doctor. He described symptoms of obstructive sleep apnoea including witnessed apnoea, choking arousals and loud snoring. He also reported intermittent diarrhoea for 2 years but denied weight loss or rectal blood or mucous. A CT chest showed multiple bilateral nodules of varying size the largest being 3.6 cm, and multiple low density liver lesions. The provisional diagnosis was metastatic colorectal cancer. Bronchoscopy with EBUS guidance did not yield the diagnosis which was eventually made by trans-thoracic needle aspiration without complication. Echinococcus serology performed post procedure was >1024, consistent with echinococcus infection. This case of echinococcus disease is presented and the vectors discussed. Echinococcus disease was previously prevalent in Australia and New Zealand, with a reduction in incidence from improved animal husbandry. With an increasing deer population in South East Queensland and subsequent rising human contact, clinical awareness is necessary to avoid potential complications from biopsy and ensure cases are promptly treated rather than mistakenly diagnosed as incurable disease. Introduction Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a leading cause of mortality, morbidity and hospital admission places strain on our healthcare system. Procalcitonin (PCT) is a biomarker of bacterial infection which may help gauge the severity and prognosis of patients with CAP. Aim To examine the role of PCT measurement in reducing hospital admissions, length of stay (LOS), and antibiotic (AB) usage in patients with CAP. Methods Prospective, single-blinded, externally controlled study of consenting adult patients admitted with CAP. PCT levels were obtained on day 1 and day 3 (if indicated). The investigator evaluated clinical parameters and the PCT values to determine the timing of oral AB switch and discharge. This process was used to compare with standard practice but was not actually implemented for the purpose of this study. Results Sixty patients were included in the study. The mean age was 66.5\u00b121.2y and 56.3% were male. The average PSI was 91 \u00b1 40 (Class IV) and the median CURB-65 was 2. The mean LOS for this cohort was 5.32\u00b14.56 d and the calculated LOS using PCT guidance pathway was 3.68\u00b12.81 d. (p = 0.00006) A multivariate analysis will be presented. Conclusions Our study supports the hypothesis that the incorporation of PCT levels can reduce the requirement for hospital admission and LOS in patients with CAP. A randomised prospective clinical trial is planned to help clarify these findings. Support Nil. Introduction Children in the highlands of Papua New Guinea (PNG) suffer on average 4.3 acute lower respiratory infections (ALRIs) before age 18 months, 1/3 of which are moderate or severe. While Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae are the primary bacterial cause of ALRI in PNG, the role of viruses in the aetiology of ALRI is uncertain. Aim Determine identification rates of respiratory viruses in nasal samples collected from children with moderate/severe ALRI and healthy children aged <18 months in PNG. Methods As part of a neonatal pneumococcal conjugate vaccine trial in the PNG highlands, we collected pernasal swabs from children with moderate/severe ALRI (n = 49) and at routine follow-up (n = 48). RT-PCR methods were used to identify a broad range of respiratory viruses. The frequency of viral detection was compared between groups of samples collected during an ALRI and routinely using Chi-square analysis. Results Several viruses were detected more frequently in ALRI than routine samples: adenoviruses 33.3/12.5 (% of ALRI samples positive/% of routine samples positive) p = 0.032, influenza viruses 22.5/7.9 p = 0.023 and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) 8.2/ 0.0 p = 0.043. Human metapneumovirus and parainfluenza viruses were detected in four and three samples, with no difference between groups. Human coronaviruses and human rhinoviruses (HRV) were less commonly detected in ALRI than in routine samples (4.2/8.3 p = 0.042 and 57.1/72.3 p = 0.178, respectively). A total of 62 different HRV strains were identified. Conclusion In young children in PNG, viral identification rates are high, with RSV, adenoviruses and influenza viruses associated with moderate/severe ALRI and a large amount of genetic diversity of rhinoviruses in both sick and healthy children. Introduction To increase the documentation and documented provision of an electronic Asthma Action Plan (e-AAP) to children discharged with asthma from the Emergency Department (ED) at CHW. Methods An electronic AAP (e-AAP) was introduced in April 2008 by a multidisciplinary team comprising representatives. At CHW, AAPs were available to be printed off by the intranet. To be entered into the electronic medical record (eMR), the medical officer had to photocopy the completed plan which would then be scanned into the eMR. Evidence suggested that busy doctors, particularly in the ED, were either not providing patients with AAPs on discharge or not photocopying them for the medical record. The evaluation of the e-AAP consisted of a review of the documented provision of asthma action plans in the hospital wide eMR (Powerchart) for a year pre & post the introduction of the e-AAP, a review of patients discharged from the ED with a diagnosis of asthma for similar six month periods pre and post intervention and a medical staff satisfaction survey. Results The total number of plans recorded in eMR increased by 816%, from 2007-2008 to 2008-2009 . The number of plans recorded for ED discharges increased significantly from 2% to 73% [p < 0.001]. The number of patients recorded as leaving the ED with a plan increased significantly from 20% to 79% (p < 0.001). The use of the e-AAP in the ED is now standard of care and this is also being adopted hospital wide as more staff became familiar with its usefulness.Conclusion The e-AAP significantly increased the number of recorded AAPs and patients discharged with a recorded AAP.

However, the effect of dietary fat on airway inflammation has not been investigated. We hypothesised that a high fat intake may lead to increased airway neutrophilia in asthma. The aim of this study was to examine the effect of a high fat versus low fat food challenge on airway inflammation in asthma. Methods Non-obese subjects with asthma were randomized to receive a high fat/ high energy (HF) (n = 14) or low fat/ low energy (LF) (n = 16) food challenge. 16 obese subjects also received a HF challenge. Subjects on the HF challenge consumed a meal containing 4480 kJ, including 52% of energy (60 g) from fat. Subjects on the LF challenge consumed a meal containing 840 kJ, including 13% of energy (3 g) from fat. At baseline, hypertonic saline challenge and clinical assessment were performed. Induced sputum samples were collected at baseline and at 4 hours. Airway inflammatory markers included induced sputum total and differential cell counts, IL-8 and neutrophil elastase, measured by commercial assay. TLR4 mRNA expression from sputum cells was measured using RT-PCR. Results At 4 hours after the food challenge, subjects on the HF challenge, had a significantly higher increase in %sputum neutrophils (16.4 (4.4 (SEM)) % vs. 3.4 (4.1) %, p = 0.044) and higher fold increase in TLR4 mRNA expression (2.06 (1.3-5.4 (IQR)) vs. 1.00 (0.6-1.4), p = 0.037), compared to the LF challenge. Subjects on the HF challenge also had an impaired bronchodilator response, with a lower increase in FEV1/FVC% at 4 hours compared to the LF challenge (1.0 (-2.0-2.6 (IQR)) % vs. 4.5 (2.7-6.8) %, p = 0.001). There were no differences in the responses of obese vs. non-obese asthmatics to the HF challenge. Conclusions A high fat/ high energy challenge causes an increase in airway inflammation and suppresses bronchodilator response in asthma. Strategies aimed at reducing dietary fat intake may be useful in reducing inflammation in asthma. Support NHMRC project grant. Introduction Longitudinal FEV 1 data in children with non-cystic fibrosis (non-CF) bronchiectasis is contradictory and there is no multi-factor data on the evolution of lung function and growth in this group. We longitudinally reviewed lung function and growth in children with non-CF bronchiectasis and explored biologically plausible factors associated with changes in these parameters over time.Methods Fifty-two children with \u20213 years of lung function data were retrospectively reviewed. Changes in annual anthropometry and spirometry at year-3 and year-5 from baseline were analysed. The impact of gender, age, aetiology, baseline FEV 1 , exacerbation frequency, radiological extent and period of diagnosis was evaluated. Results Over 3 years, the group mean FEF 25-75 %predicted and BMI z-score improved by 3.01 (p = 0.04, 95%CI 0.14-5.86) and 0.089 (p = 0.01, 95%CI 0.02-0.15) per annum, respectively. FEV 1 %predicted, FVC %predicted and height z-score all showed non-significant improvement. Over 5 years, there was improvement in FVC %predicted (slope 1.74, p = 0.001) annually but only minor improvement in other parameters. Children with immunodeficiency and those with low baseline FEV 1 had significantly lower BMI at diagnosis. Frequency of hospitalized exacerbation and low baseline FEV 1 were the only significant predictors of change in FEV 1 over 3 years. Decline in FEV 1 %predicted was large (but nonsignificant) for each additional year in age of diagnosis. Conclusions Spirometric and anthropometric parameters in children with non-CF bronchiectasis remain stable over 3-5 year follow-up period once appropriate therapy is instituted. Severe exacerbations result in accelerated lung function decline. Increased medical cognizance of children with chronic moist cough is needed for early diagnosis, better management and improving overall outcome in bronchiectasis. Introduction It is well established that many survivors of very low birth weight (VLBW; <1500 g at birth) have impaired lung function. The aim of this study was to determine whether abnormal lung function at 25 years of age is established in childhood. A second aim was to see if abnormal lung function at 8 years of age tracks through the period of normal lung development to predict impaired maximal lung function and may be a precursor to COPD in adult years. Methods A cohort of VLBW (n = 210) and normal birth weight (NBW; >2500 g at birth; n = 60) has been followed for 25 years. Very Low Birthweight participants completed spirometry and lung volumes at 8, 11, 14, 18 and 25 years of age and NBW at 14, 18 and 25 years of age. Restricted maximum likelihood modeling was used for longitudinal FEV 1 z-score as it allows for analysis of data from different time points that are not necessarily evenly spaced, without being affected by missing data. Results About 137 VLBW children completed lung function testing at 8 years of age, 20 (14.6%) had abnormal FEV 1 z-scores (defined as >2 SD's below the mean). VLBW survivors showed minimal 'catch-up' in FEV 1 z-score over the 13 years of the study; those without (bronchopulmonary dysplasia) FEV 1 improved 0.034 (p = 0.014) z-scores, those with BPD FEV 1 improved 0.033 (p = 0.039) z-scores. VLBW with BPD survivors did not return to within normal limits. Conclusions The reduced lung function in adult survivors of low birth weight is established in early childhood. While there is some improvement in growth of those with abnormal FEV 1 z-scores in early childhood, those with BPD remain below two SD's from the mean, and at the age of 25 have a reduced peak lung function. Introduction Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is a common complication of preterm birth. Although there is evidence that individuals with a history of BPD have respiratory abnormalities in childhood, there remains a paucity of evidence regarding the outcome of the disease in adulthood. In a pilot study we recently described high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) appearances of emphysema in young adults with a history of BPD. Aims To describe the structural pulmonary sequelae of bronchopulmonary dysplasia in adulthood and to evaluate a scoring system originally designed for paediatric subjects. Methods About 51 adult survivors of BPD underwent HRCT of the chest, along with lung function testing (spirometry, lung volumes and diffusing capacity) and a respiratory health survey. The CT studies were scored by two thoracic radiologists blinded to the patient's clinical details, using a previously described system developed for children and adolescents who were born prematurely using 14 parameters. Results Abnormal findings were seen in all scans, the most common findings were subpleural triangular opacities (94%), linear opacities (90%), air trapping (65%) and emphysema (47%). Agreement between the two observers for total score and common abnormalities varied with a linear weighted kappa value of 0.18 for linear opacities, 0.71 for triangular opacities, 0.76 for air trapping, and 0.66 for emphysema. Conclusions Linear and sub-triangular opacities on HRCT chest are almost universal in young adults with a history of BPD. Findings of emphysema and gas trapping are common and there is good interobservor agreement for these abnormalities. Introduction Pulmonary surfactant (PS) is synthesised by alveolar type II epithelial cells to regulate the surface tension at the air-liquid interface of the air breathing lung. Developmental maturation of PS is controlled by many factors including oxygen, glucose, catecholamines and cortisol. The intrauterine growth restricted (IUGR) fetus is hypoxemic and hypoglycaemic, with elevated plasma catecholamines and cortisol. Aim To determine the impact of IUGR induced by chronic placental restriction via the carunclectomy model on PS maturation. Methods We investigated the expression of surfactant protein (SP) -A, -B and -C and their genes in lung tissue of fetal sheep at 133 days and 141 days gestation (term, 150 \u00b1 3 days) from control and carunclectomised Merino ewes. Results Placentally restricted (PR) fetuses had a body weight <2 SD from the mean of control fetuses and a mean gestational PaO2 <17 mmHg. PR fetuses had a reduced absolute, but not relative lung weight, decreased plasma glucose and increased plasma cortisol concentration. Lung SP-A, -B and -C protein and mRNA expression were reduced in PR compared with control fetuses at both ages. SP-B and -C, but not SP-A mRNA expression and SP-A, but not SP-B or -C protein expression increased with gestational age. Mean gestational PaO2 was positively correlated with SP-A, -B and -C protein and SP-A and -C mRNA expression. SP-A and -B gene expression were inversely related to plasma cortisol concentration. Conclusion Chronic placental restriction and hypoxemia results in an inhibition of PS maturation and thus IUGR fetuses are at risk of lung complications, especially if born prematurely.

Anecdotal reports and studies in small numbers of patients suggest that adverse events associated with the 6MWT are rare in patients with CLD. This study reports observed adverse events and predictors of oxygen desaturation during the 6MWT in patients with stable CLD referred to an out-patient pulmonary rehabilitation service. Methods About 741 consecutive patients completed the 6MWT in accordance with a standardised protocol that included continuous monitoring of oxygen saturation (SpO 2 ) and heart rate (HR, Polar). The respiratory diagnoses of the patients were chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), n = 565 (76%); interstitial lung disease (ILD), n = 84 (13%); bronchiectasis, n = 46 (6%) and asthma n = 39 (5%). Results Observed adverse events occurred in 43 tests (6%). One test was terminated when the patient reported chest pain and one patient developed persistent tachycardia (HR > 200 bpm) immediately following the test. In 35 tests (5%), the tester instructed the patient to stop walking due to profound oxygen desaturation (SpO 2 <80%). Six patients prematurely terminated the 6MWT due to intolerable symptoms. Forty-seven per cent (n = 345) of patients demonstrated oxygen desaturation, defined as a decrease in SpO 2 \u20214% to <90% during the test. Pre-exercise SpO 2 was a significant predictor of desaturation in the COPD (1.79, 1.54 to 2.08, adjusted odds ratio [OR], 95% confidence intervals) and ILD (OR 1.40, 1.11 to 1.77) cohorts with FEV 1 also a predictor in patients with COPD (OR 3.02, 1.77 to 5.15). Conclusions Profound oxygen desaturation is the commonest adverse event observed during the 6MWT in patients with stable CLD. This finding questions the American Thoracic Society guidelines for the 6MWT which state that oximetry is optional. Introduction There is weak support for use of opiates in palliation of refractory dyspnea; respiratory depression is perceived as a major risk. We evaluated the effect of i.v. morphine on dyspnea in controlled conditions and related this to concomitant respiratory depression. Methods With ethical approval, 6 healthy subjects received 0.07 mg/kg morphine sulphate or saline on separate days in a randomised controlled design. Before and for 2 hours after administration, subjects performed (i) dyspnea responses (measured with a Visual Analog Scale) to increasing P ET CO 2 with ventilation () constrained at resting levels (ii) Unconstrainedresponses to increasing P ET CO 2 to assess respiratory drive. Results Pre morphine with constrained , all subjects tolerated an elevated P ET CO 2 of 50-55 mmHg; mean dyspnea rating was 56% (7(SEM)). Post morphine, at the same P ET CO 2 , mean dyspnea rating fell to 29 % (5, p < 0.05, paired t). All subjects reported reduced dyspnea at 20 minutes and this was sustained for 2 hours. No changes in dyspnea scores were seen following saline. With unconstrained, at equivalent levels of P ET CO 2 , morphine, but not saline, was associated with a lower in each subject for up to 2 hours; mean fell from 30 (3) to 22 (2) l/min (p < 0.05). To assess if respiratory depression could account for reduced dyspnea, scores were compared at the different P ET CO 2 levels that induced equivalent unconstrainedlevels with and without morphine; mean dyspnea scores were not different (54 (10) vs. 52 (10) %). Conclusion A clinically moderate dose of morphine results in substantial and sustained relief of laboratory dyspnea in a small group of healthy subjects consistent with the associated degree of respiratory depression.

            "text": "Introduction Pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) is a cornerstone of management for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and its efficacy is supported with Level 1 evidence. Despite the known benefits of PR, up to one third of those people with COPD who are referred to PR choose not to participate. There is little information regarding perceived barriers to attendance in an Australian health care context. Methods Nineteen people with COPD (10 women and nine men, GOLD stage I-IV, age range 53-86 years) who had declined to take part in an outpatient PR program at a metropolitan teaching hospital participated in a qualitative study. Semi-structured interviews were used to establish reasons for failing to attend the PR program. These interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed using the principles of grounded theory. Results Three major themes were identified regarding barriers to attendance at PR. The first related to difficulties with getting there, including a lack of available transport and poor mobility. The second theme related to a lack of perceived benefit, including perceptions that PR would not improve their health or that they were currently doing enough exercise. The third major theme involved restrictions imposed by underlying medical conditions and included the influence of comorbidities and pain. Minor themes that arose included competing demands, age, fatigue and program timing. Conclusions In Australia many patients with COPD who are invited to attend PR do not perceive the program would be beneficial, feel they are too unwell to attend or have difficulty with access. Further support should be offered to PR candidates and alternative methods of delivering PR to enhance uptake should be considered. Introduction Pulmonary rehabilitation has emerged as recommended standard care for people with chronic lung disease. However potential demand to access these services far exceeds the available resources. This study's aim was to determine if baseline measures of the BODE Index, dyspnea (Modified Medical Research Council questionnaire), 6 minute walk distance (6MWD), physical activity, Taunton Respiratory quality of life questionnaire (TRQ), smoking status, and frequency of hospitalisations can predict responders to pulmonary rehabilitation. Methods We retrospectively evaluated all participants with a diagnosis of COPD, who attended the pulmonary rehabilitation program at the Prince Charles Hospital between 2004 and 2007. A participant was considered a responder to pulmonary rehabilitation if benefit was achieved in exercise capacity ( \u202120% increase in 6MWD) and/or quality of life ( \u20210.5 SD decrease in TRQ as described by Cohen's Effect Size). Prediction of responders was assessed using chi square cross tabulations and t-tests with significant measures analysed using a binary logistic regression model. Results One hundred and forty-two participants (76 males, mean age 69 (9 SD) years, mean FEV1 50.4 (20.3) %) who completed pulmonary rehabilitation were analysed. Sixtyfive (47.8%) people were categorised as responders using the above criteria. Significant mean differences were: TRQ 40.9 (25.2) for responders vs. 18.5 (16.3) for non-responders p < 0.001; BODE Index 3.4 (2.4) vs. 2.5 (1.7) p = 0.02; 6MWD 368 (123) m vs. 422 (96) m p = 0.004. The binary logistic regression model showed a higher TRQ score was the only factor that predicted a responder to pulmonary rehabilitation. No other measure added to the predictive power of the model. Conclusion Higher TRQ scores may be useful in predicting which participants are most likely to benefit from referral to pulmonary rehabilitation. Further study is underway investigating other factors that may improve these findings. Support Nil. Nomination Nil. Conflict of Interest No.",
