Treatment for ICH is primarily supportive, and the clinical outcome is poor with potential huge burden for the caretakers.

Napoli et al. reported that higher C-reactive protein (CRP), one of acute inflammatory markers, is associated with increased mortality in sICH patients and improved mortality prediction when added to the ICH score [6]. The inflammation cascades following ICH comprise both cellular components and molecular components [4]. Blood-derived leukocytes, macrophages, and resident microglia, that are activated and accumulate within the brain after ICH, are the major inflammatory cells. Animal models of ICH provide substantial evidences for the presence of leukocyte infiltration into the hematoma with the breakdown of the blood\u2013brain-barrier (BBB) [7], [8]. Clinical studies also support the role of leukocytes in ICH. Early studies by Molle [9] and Lee et al. [10] showed that leukocyte counts in cerebrospinal fluid were frequently elevated after ICH. Moreover, patients with ICH also have higher peripheral leukocyte counts [11], which were reported to be one of the independent predictors of neurologic deterioration in ICH [12]. Loftspring et al. [13] quantitatively detected the frequency of infiltrating leukocytes that enter the brain after ICH by using flow cytometry and found that, at 4 days ICH mice brain presented with a 3.4-fold increase in CD45hiGR-1+ cells (mostly are neutrophils) and 1.7-fold increase in CD4+ T cells, compared with control mice, indicating that both innate and adaptive immune cells play roles in the development of brain injury after ICH.",

            "text": "Tim-3, a member of T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain family, was firstly identified as a specific cell surface marker on Th1 cells, but not on Th2 cells [15], [16]. Further studies also described the abundant expression of Tim-3 on CD8+ T cells, monocytes/macrophages, mast cells, NK cells and dendritic cells [17], [18], [19]. A huge amount of data has disclosed the complicated functions of Tim-3 on different types of immune cells in the underlying physiological or pathological milieu [20]. Animal and clinical studies also proved that Tim-3 is involved in the pathogenesis of various kinds of diseases (e.g. tumor, viral infection, atherosclerosis, diabetes, and autoimmune diseases) by modulating the intensity and duration of innate and/or adaptive immune response [21], [22]. More recently our research and that of several other groups suggested that Tim-3 might play a role in the inflammatory reaction in nervous system diseases. Zhang et al. [23] found that time course of Tim-3(+) cell accumulation correlated positively with disease progression of experimental autoimmune neuritis. Our previous findings showed that Tim-3 expression was upregulated in peripheral blood monocytes (PBMCs) of ischemic stroke patients and correlated with abnormal lipid levels\n[24]. However, there is still no report about the roles of Tim-3 in the pathogenesis of ICH. Here, we found the different alterations of Tim-3 expression on PBMC subsets in ICH patients and, more importantly, there was significant correlation between Tim-3 expression on CD8+ T cells and the inflammatory response, the Glasgow coma scale score and the outcome of the patients. This work gives new insights into the inflammatory mechanisms of ICH and might provide a novel candidate molecule for prognosis evaluation and clinical treatment of ICH patients.",

In the present study, we found that Tim-3 expressions in ICH patients were elevated on peripheral CD14+ monocytes and CD16+CD56+ NK cells (Fig. 1). Numerous studies have elucidated the regulatory roles of Tim-3, expressed on innate immune cells. Tim-3 expression on macrophages and dendritic cells promoted tissue inflammation by activating NF-\u03baB and enhancing TNF\u03b1 secretion [30]. Reported data about Tim-3 on NK cells are paradoxical. Gleason et al. demonstrated that Tim3 functioned as a receptor on NK cells to enhance IFN-\u03b3 production. Oppositely, our previous study showed that elevated Tim-3 expression on NK cells in chronic hepatitis B patients suppressed its cytotoxicity and IFN-\u03b3 secretion [31]. Unfortunately, we did not find any significant association of Tim-3 expression on peripheral CD14+ monocytes or CD16+CD56+ NK cells with the disease severity or the outcome of ICH patients (Fig. 2). It needs further investigation about the expression pattern of Tim-3 on infiltrating leukocytes in the brains of ICH patients and its dynamic change at the different stages of ICH.",

            "text": "Tim-3 also exerts key regulatory roles on adaptive immune cells and then participates in the pathogenesis of related inflammatory diseases. Interaction of Tim-3 and its ligand induced apoptosis of Th1 cells and inhibited Th1-mediated immunity [32]. Similarly, Tim-3 expression was related with the exhaustion of CD8+ T cells and ameliorated anti-tumor or anti-virus immunity [33]. Flow cytometry results showed that Tim-3 expressions on both CD3+ and CD8+ T cells were weakened in ICH patients (Fig. 1). More importantly, the statistical results revealed that the Tim-3 expression on CD8+ T cells was negatively correlated with GCS score on arrival (Fig. 2), 30-day GOS score (Fig. 3), and the white blood cell count (Fig. 5) of ICH patients. Similarly, Ndhlovu et al. [34] reported that patients with HTLV-1 associated myelopathy/tropical spastic paraparesis also had a systemic down-regulation of Tim-3 expression on virus-specific CD8+ T cells. Moreover, Tim3\u2212 CD8+ T cells showed highly active phenotype and might exert regulatory roles. Recently, the roles of CD8+ T cells in inflammatory CNS disorders have attracted particular attentions [35]. In autoimmune and infectious CNS diseases, brain-infiltrating CD8+ T cells exerted not only detrimental proinflammatory and killing functions but also regulatory function by direct killing of activated CD4+ T cells or by secretion of immunosuppressive cytokines such as IL-10 and transforming growth factor-\u03b2 [36]. In mice with coronavirus-induced acute encephalitis, IL-10+ regulatory CD8+ T cells minimized immunopathological change and were more highly activated [37]. Our results and these reported data imply that the downregulated Tim-3 expression on CD8+ T cells might be probably a protective response in ICH patients and be helpful for patients' recovery. However, the exact roles of CD8+ T cells and the effect of Tim-3 on CD8+ T cells in ICH are still needed to be further explored.",

            "text": "The changes of Tim-3 expression on immunocytes were induced by different inflammatory milieus. Thus, we preliminarily analyzed the potential mechanisms for altered Tim-3 expression in ICH patients. As shown in Table 1, blood glucose level in ICH patients was significantly higher than that of healthy controls, which is consistent with the reported data that hyperglycemia is one of risk factors for poor outcome of ICH [27], [38]. More importantly, both clinical and experimental data showed that acute or chronic hyperglycemia alters many cellular signaling pathways and is involved in the inflammatory processes [28]. Gonzalez et al. [39] showed that high glucose concentrations induce TNF-a production through the down-regulation of CD33. However, we found no significant association between blood glucose concentration and Tim-3 expression on CD8+ T cells, CD14+ monocytes or CD16+CD56+ NK cells in ICH patients. Till now, there are few reports about the underlying mechanisms leading to altered Tim-3 expression in pathological conditions. IL-12 and IL-4 were reported to be responsible for regulating Tim-3 expression in non-Hodgkin lymphoma [40] and in pregnancy [41] respectively. It is worthy to further study the role of other potential factors (e.g. cytokine profiles) in regulating Tim-3 expression in ICH patients.",
