            "text": "Acute respiratory failure (ARF) is a common and life-threatening consequence of a diverse group of diseases 1, 2 . When ARF patients fail conventional oxygen therapies (COT) using non invasive delivery systems (nasal prongs, cannulae, masks) invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) is often initiated. As new diseases emerge and novel therapies are developed, IMV is becoming more commonplace across the world and its use is rapidly increasing over time 3, 4 . This can have an impact on patient outcomes, notwithstanding the burden posed on critical resources. Mechanically ventilated patients represent approximately 3% of acute hospitalisations and 30% of intensive care unit (ICU) admissions 1, 2, 5, 6 . In the USA, the mean hospital length of stay for a ventilated patient is 14 days with a total hospital cost of $34,257 5 . This amounts to $27.0 billion or 12% of all hospital costs for 700,000 patients receiving IMV annually 2 . Outcomes following IMV are highly dependent on the aetiology of the ARF, severity of illness, plus patient age and co-morbidities. 30% to 40% of patients requiring IMV die without ever being discharged from hospital 1,2 , and many survive with a significantly compromised quality of life [7] [8] [9] . This is most pronounced in the older population -patients over 65 years of age receive IMV at rates that are 3 to 5 times the national average 2 with a 2-year survival as low as 48% in the very elderly. Reducing the risks and costs of critical care, of IMV in particular, is a major priority for care providers, health system administrators, tax payers and policymakers 5 .",

A recent randomised clinical trial 11 in patients with non-hypercapnic, hypoxemic ARF, demonstrated a non significant reduction in the need for IMV when HFO2 therapy was used first, compared with COT and NIV. The use of HFO2 also resulted in an increased 90day survival. In this study, the rates of subsequent intubation for HFO2, COT and NIV treated patients were 38%, 47% and 50% respectively. The leading cause of intubation in all three groups was worsening ARF and hypoxemia (> 70%).",

Significant improvements in oxygenation have been reported in infants with ARF on nasal continuous positive airway pressure and NO gas inhalation 13 . This study reported that safe ambient nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and NO levels were observed (0.30 and 0.01 ppm). The authors concluded that non-invasively inhaled NO may have a synergistic effect in conjunction with airway recruitment strategies such as nasal CPAP. Inhaled NO does not reduce systemic vasuclar resistance or significantly affect systemic blood pressures-important as many patients with ARF may also present with a sepsis related vasoplegic syndrome.",

They were able to maintain their airway and clear airway secretions, were haemodynamically stable or receiving low dose vasoactive support. Patients who demonstrated signs of respiratory fatigue were excluded. A summary of patient demographics, severity of illness scores, details of respiratory support provided and outcomes can be found in Table 1 .

NO use was at the clinicians discretion and therefore further studies are indicated to explore the efficacy and economic analysis of non-invasive NO inhalation in pateints with hypoxic ARF. Whilst studies of the use of NO in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) have so far failed to demonstrate a survival benefit, the benefits and risks of non-invasive NO inhalation in self-breathing ARF patients has not been systematically studied. Further studies that demonstrate and evaluate the efficacy of less-invasive therapies to improve oxygenation in ARF are warranted.

In a similar fashion, non-invasive NO inhalation may have a potential role during the early phases of COVID-19 infection to prevent progression of the disease to the point of requiring IMV. Additionally amongst patients who are intubated and are demonstrated to be responsive, earlier extubation may be facilitated using non invasive iNO -thus reducing the duration of IMV and liberating patients from ventilators faster. This would potentially shorten the duration of ICU stay and have important implications on healthcare resources.
