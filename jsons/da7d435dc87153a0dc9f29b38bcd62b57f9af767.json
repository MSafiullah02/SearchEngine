Leslie In Osler's time, bacterial pneumonia was a dreaded event, so important that he borrowed John Bunyan's characterization of tuberculosis and anointed the pneumococcus, as the prime pathogen, \"Captain of the men of death.\"1 One hundred years later much has changed, but much remains the same. Pneumonia is now the sixth most common cause of death and the most common lethal infection in the United States. Hospital-acquired pneumonia is now the second most common nosocomial infection? It was documented as a complication in 0.6% of patients in a national surveillance study,3 and has been reported in as many as 20% of patients in critical care units. 4 Furthermore, it is the leading cause of death among nosocomial infections.5 Leu and colleagues 6 were able to associate one third of the mortality in patients with nosocomial pneumonia to the infection itself. The increase in hospital stay, which averaged 7 days, was statistically significant. It has been estimated that nosocomial pneumonia produces costs in excess of $500 million each year in the United States, largely related to the increased length of hospital stay.",

The discovery and then commercialization of penicillin opened a new era of optimism, which was bolstered by discovery of the macrolides, such as erythromycin, and the aminoglycosides, such as streptomycin. It was not long, however, before the seemingly endless resilience and resourcefulness of bacterial pathogens became manifest. The \"Cold War\" between medicinal chemists and bacteria began in earnest in the 1960s with the emergence of Staphylococcus aureus that were resistant to penicillin and the increasing prominence of gram-negative bacilli as serious pathogens. The war has continued unabated, shifting battlefields as immunosuppressive therapies have been developed and patients survive previously fatal primary diseases. The battle has waxed and waned as new therapeutic strategies have been developed and new mechanisms of resistance have been elucidated. At times the front has encroached 228 on virgin territory, as new infectious agents have been discovered. Legionnaires' disease taught us, in the mid-1970s, that we still had a lot to learn about the enemy. In the 1980s, gram-positive bacteria reasserted their importance, as methicillin-resistant staphylococci and enterococci joined their gram-negative counterparts. 7 It seems we take one step backward for every two forward in our war against bacterial pneumonia. The \"Men of Death\" still stalk our hospital wards and lurk in our streets for the weak, the unprepared, and the iatrogenically compromised.",

            "text": "The most important routes by which bacteria are delivered to the air spaces are inhalation of an aerosol, aspiration of respiratory or gastrointestinal secretions, and bacteremic spread. Exogenous pneumonia is predominantly transmitted by inhalation of an infectious aerosol, as exemplified classically by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (see Chapter 9) . Bacillus anthracis produces a variety of diseases, depending in part on the mechanism of bacterial transmission. Cutaneous anthrax, the most common manifestation of infection, results from direct inoculation of spores from contaminated soil or animal skins l6 \u2022 17 or from exposure to bacteria in the laboratory. 18 . 19 The infection remains localized to the skin. The most feared form of anthrax, however, is the overwhelming pneumonia that results from inhalation of aerosolized spores. Pneumonic anthrax is fortunately rare, because aerosols of large proportions are uncommon. Careful epidemiologic investigation may be necessary to establish the source of the aerosol, as occurred when workers in a woolen mill contracted inhalational anthrax,20 after the accident at a biologic warfare facility in Russia,21 or after the intentional exposures in the U.S. more recently. 22 Analogous situations are found in plague and tularemia, which usually infect the lungs as a by-product of bacteremic disease but may produce primary respiratory infection after inhalation of aerosolized bacteria. The most recent example of an exogenous infection is Legionella pneumophila pneumonia, which as noted is almost exclusively associated with aquatic environments. Most investigators accept that an important source of infection is aerosolization of bacteria from cooling towers. 11 ,13,23 Much of the evidence is derived from epidemiologic studies, buttressed in many cases by molecular analysis of bacterial isolates. A particularly instructive incident ushered in a pair of epidemics in Burlington, Vermont, during the summer of 1980. 24 Two maintenance workers entered an inactive cooling tower on the roof of the building that houses the College of Medicine to prepare it for the summer season. During their work the fan in the tower was activated, producing a sudden blast of aerosolized water; the men then turned the fan off and continued their work. Within several days both men became sick and one developed a severe pneumonia that required prolonged hospitalization. Shortly thereafter a biphasic epidemic began that was associated epidemiologically with the cooling tower. 13 Further, strains of L. pneumophila serogroup 1, which were isolated from the cooling tower water and from infected patients, displayed the same antigenic profile when tested with a panel of monoclonal antibodies. 25 Cooling towers are not the only sources of Legionella aerosols, however. Small epidemics of legionnaires' disease have been traced to the use in nebulizers of drinking water that was contaminated with Legionella. 26 Hypothetically many other daily activities are associated with transient aerosols, such as turning on a faucet , flushing a toilet, or taking a shower. Despite the concentration of attention on cooling towers, the source of most cases of sporadic legionnaires' disease is unknown, but probably includes transmission of bacteria from a source in potable water to the patient. It has not been determined whether the mechanism is inhalation of an aerosol, aspiration of potable water, or both. The role of drinking water has been further emphasized, however, by the dramatic demonstration that Legionella dumoffii produced sternal wound infections when tap water was used to bathe the incisions of patients who were recovering from cardiac surgery?7",

Many experimental studies have documented the variety of interactions that may take place, depending in part on the nature of the infecting organism, the bacterial inoculum, and the state of the infected host. Experimental systems that deliver bacteria to the lungs by aerosol utilize chambers that expose the whole animal 46 or only the snout. 47 These systems most closely simulate inhalation of nebulized or aerosolized bacteria from exogenous sources. Models that employ intranasal or intratracheal inoculation of bacterial suspensions resemble aspiration of endogenous or colonizing microflora. 48 Bacteria are removed from the lung by two pathways: (1) retrograde up the respiratory tract on the \"mucociliary escalator,\" to be expectorated or swallowed; and (2) into the interstitium. 49 Transport centripetally out of the lung occurs by both cellular and noncellular mechanisms. Free particles are swept along the surface of the ciliated mucosa, following the flow of fluid being removed from the lung. 50 An additional and probably more important mechanism is the removal of cells, especially resident alveolar macrophages, that have phagocytosed ingested bacteria. 51 Clearance of bacteria often follows a biphasic curve, and the ciliary mechanism accounts for the early phase, which occurs in a matter of minutes to hours. S. pneumoniae radiolabeled with technetium was cleared from the lung, but did not appear in the hepatic reticuloendothelial system within the first 6 hours after aerosol challenge. 52 Factors that reduce mucociliary clearance, such as influenza virus infection, also reduce the clearance of inhaled particles from the lower respiratory tractY Ultrastructural examination of human upperrespiratory ciliated epithelium from children with respiratory viral infections demonstrated damaged cilia that persisted for 2 to 10 days after the infection. 54 In contrast to the luminal mechanism, the interstitial transport pathways appear to be oriented radially along the terminal bronchiole and thence to the lymphatics and either the pleural surface or regional lymph nodes. 49 The familiar distribution of carbon in the pleura, peribronchial region, and lymph nodes at postmortem examination reflects this pathway (Fig. 8.3 ). This second phase of clearance is considerably slower and may last days, weeks, or months. It is, however, crucial for the development of an adaptive immune response, through antigen processing and presentation, which ultimately lead to antibody production and immunologic memory.",

A previously healthy young man, a cigarette smoker, developed acute Legionella pneumonia. Legionella pneumophila serogroup 1 was isolated in a pure culture from lung tissue. This papermounted whole-lung section (Gough technique) demonstrates well the association of inflammatory exudate with pulmonary lobules, because centrilobular regions are marked by intense carbon pigmentation. Lobular lesions are evident in the upper lobe. Consolidation has become confluent in the lower part of the upper lobe and throughout the lower lobe. Such extensive consolidation may be characterized as lobar or sublobar if the focal nature of the process is not recognized. while the aerosol is being generated cannot be completely eliminated. 56 ,57 The interaction between the infecting bacteria and the resident phagocytic cells is a critical factor in the outcome. When most respiratory pathogens are introduced into the air spaces, physical clearance occurs and bactericidal activity is expressed to varying degrees. In the initial encounter with an infectious agent, defense mechanisms are not immunologically specific, and the complement segment of the humoral immune system plays an important role. Some bacterial species, such as S. aureus, are readily phagocytosed by resident macrophages. In contrast, encapsulated bacteria, such as S. pneumoniae and H. injluenzae type b, are inherently resistant to phagocytosis in the absence of opsonins. Pneumococci are able to activate the complement cascade, either through the classical pathway in the presence of antibody or through the 8 alternate pathway when antibody is absent. 58 Winkelstein and Tomasz 59 demonstrated that the teichoic acid component of the cell wall is responsible for the activation of the alternate pathway. Phagocytosis of pneumococci by neutrophils is enhanced by complement, antibody, or conserved bacterial products (known as \"patterns\"), which interact with cellular complement receptors, Fc receptors, and Toll-like receptors respectively.60\u00b761 It appears that there are serotypic differences among pneumococci in their interaction with the complement system. Coonrod and colleagues 62 reported that type I strains were not opsonized by complement, type 3 strains were opsonized partly by the alternative pathway and partly by the classical pathway, and type 25 strains were readily opsonized by the alternate pathway.",

These include a subset of C-type lectins, called collectins, such as surfactant proteins A and D; acute phase reactants; and soluble proteins with poreforming capabilities, referred to as defensins. 68 -7o In addition to producing defensins, type II alveolar epithelial cells also have been found to up regulate surface expression of molecules of the integrin family, which are typically produced by activated endothelium. 71 O'Brien and colleagues 72 corroborated these data in a murine model of pneumonia by demonstrating that expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-I (ICAM-I) by alveolar pneumocytes markedly enhances intraalveolar phagocytosis of K. pneumoniae by macrophages and neutrophils. They were able to show also that ICAM-I knockout mice had significantly higher mortality rates after Klebsiella infection than did control mice in the absence of any variation in recruitment of neutrophils into the lung. Such nonimmunoglobulin factors as complement and alveolar lining material may explain the early observations in experimental pneumococcal pneumonia that limitation of the expanding pneumonic lesion and phagocytosis of bacteria occurred so soon after infection that specific antibody could not be responsible for the effective host defense. 73 Facultative intracellular pathogens, such as L. pneumaphila or M. tuberculosis, actually proliferate in the resident alveolar macrophages after phagocytosis so that only the relatively small component of physical clearance is operative. 74 In this situation the best strategy from the point of view of host defenses is to keep bacteria out of macrophages; opsonins may actually be undesirable. In vitro, at least, the addition of specific antibody opsonin to cultures of L. pneumophila and human alveolar macrophages promotes adherence of bacteria and does not inhibit intracellular multiplication. 75",

Once the inflammatory process is initiated, a complex set of interactions among cells, bacteria, and plasma proteins sets in motion a series of events that is perpetuated by a continuing network of chemotactic stimuli. 76 The precise sequence of events depends in part on the virulence of the infecting bacterium and the quantity of organisms in the challenge. Onofrio and colleagues 77 studied the interactions of inflammatory cells and graded quantities of S. aureus that had been introduced into the lungs of mice. If the inoculum is small and the resident macrophages are capable of engulfing and killing the bacteria, there is no need for additional cellular recruitment and chemotactic factors are not generated. With intermediate inocula an active recruitment of polymorphonuclear neutrophils ensues, after which bacterial growth is checked. If the inocula are sufficiently high, neutrophils are recruited but the combined cellular response is inadequate to control the growth of bacteria.

When particles such as Sepharose beads or bacteria are phagocytosed by alveolar macrophages in vitro, the stimulated macrophages release a low molecular weight chemotactic factor that is distinct from C5a. Incubation of the particles with serum augments the chemotactic response and causes the fixation of C3b onto the particle surface. 84 The appearance of polymorphonuclear neutrophils in the air spaces coincides with the development of leaky capillaries and transudation of immunoglobulin, albumin, and other serum factors. 74 Ultrastructurally, there is damage to endothelial cells and movement of neutrophils between the cells, through the basement membrane, and into the interstitium. Damage to epithelial lining cells and movement of neutrophils through the gaps into the alveoli ensues if the chemotactic response originates in the air space ( Fig. 8.6 ).81.86 Experimental damage to the pulmonary vascular endothelium is mediated by polymorphonuclear neutrophils and is blocked by depletion of circulating neutrophils, whether the process initiates within the vascular system 87 . 88 or within the alveoli. 81 In FIGURE 8.6.

Glutaraldehyde-fixed os mica ted lung stained with uranyl acetate. 235 the trachea, neutrophils migrate through the mucosa serially, not randomly between epithelial cells. 89 Accumulation of neutrophils in the air spaces begins within hours of infection and continues for as long as 3 days. The next phase in the inflammatory process is the recruitment of circulating peripheral blood monocytes, which begins within 1 to 2 days after infection and continues for days to weeks, depending on the nature of the stimulus. The origin of these cells in the bone marrow has been established by radiolabeling and by irradiation of bone marrow in experimental animals. 90 By the time the monocytes traverse the interstitium and reach the air spaces, they are mature macrophages. These recruited macro phages differ immunochemically and functionally from the resident alveolar macrophages. They show evidence of having ingested neutrophilic enzymes, and their anticoagulant and fibrinolytic activity is increased to maximize removal of fibrin. 91 Completing the cycle of inflammatory events, this recruitment of monocytemacrophages is elicited by chemotactic factors produced by polymorphonuclear neutrophils. A complement stimulus for inflammatory cells does not result in macrophage recruitment if animals have been first rendered neutropenic. 92 The final inflammatory cell component is the lymphocyte, which appears in the air spaces 5 to 7 days after infection. 74 The lymphocyte is not usually considered a critical mediator of the inflammatory pneumonic process, possibly due to its late arrival at the scene. Yet its integral role in orchestrating the adaptive arm of the immune response, which takes place largely in nearby lymphoid organs-outside of the pulmonary parenchyma-is worth considering. Specific mucosal immunity in the form of secreted and circulating antibodies as well as cellmediated destruction of virulent intracellular organisms are contingent upon the viability and competence of certain lymphocyte populations. 9 There is experimental evidence that these immunologically specific cells may differ depending on the nature of the stimulus. Shennib and colleagues 93 noted that subsets of lymphocytes had distinctive characteristics when the injury was lung allotransplantation or P aeruginosa pneumonia in experimentally treated dogs.",

Within a few days, macrophages begin to accumulate in the air spaces and begin to clear the cellular debris. Simultaneously, interstitial fibroblastlike cells proliferate and migrate into the air spaces. These migrating fibroblasts become myofibroblasts capable of exerting tractional forces on surrounding cells and structures and eventually secrete collagen matrix, providing the principal manifestation of the \"organizing\" or \"proliferative\" phase ( Fig. 8.8 ) of DAD.95 It corresponds to Laennec's \"gray hepatization\" phase of lobar pneumonia (see below). In time, myofibroblasts and their associated matrix are reabsorbed into the alveolar wall by cellular contraction and eventual apoptosis. Variable collagen deposition occurs, depending on the extent, severity, and duration of the initial insult. Thus, after a limited insult, such as experimental oxygen toxicity, there is only slight residual tissue alteration, consistent with a return to normal or near-normal lung function.

These reparative cells serve a number of functions in the reparative process (tissue contraction, collagen secretion). When the injury event is complete and fails to disrupt the basement membranes, these cells contract into the interstitium where they presumably undergo programmed cell death (apoptosis). The origin of these myofibroblasts is not completely known. Some hypothesize that they are derived from mesenchymal stem cells resident in the alveolar interstitium. New evidence suggests that they derive from circulating cells (monocytes or stem cells) that differentiate in situ. (From Epperly MW, Guo H, Gretton JE, Greenberger JS. Bone marrow origin of myofibroblasts in irradiation pulmonary fibrosis. Am J Respir Cell Mol BioI 2003;29(2): 213-224.) Similarly, a primary therapy for pneumococcal pneumonia before the development of effective antibiotics was immunotherapy with type-specific antibody. In classic studies performed by W. Barry Wood,73 administration of antibody to experimental rats that had been infected with S. pneumoniae dramatically limited the spread of the inflammatory process, cleared the bloodstream of bacteria, and prevented the extension of early pleurisy. Musher and colleagues102 demonstrated a quantitative relationship between the amount of anticapsular antibody to S. pneumoniae type 4 and protection from infection in experimental mice. In recent years several polysaccharide-protein conjugate immunogens (now included in both S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae vaccines) have proven remarkably effective, in the process elucidating a variety of adaptive immune mechanisms. 103-1 06 The large variety of immunotypes in many bacterial species makes assessment of protective immunity difficult.

As has been indicated, the colonizing oropharyngeal flora vary by age and hospitalization status. Knowledge of the most likely etiologic agents directs the selection of the most appropriate antibiotics. The patient-related risk factors also differ in community-acquired and nosocomial infections. A summary of etiologic agents for community-acquired and nosocomial pneumonia is presented in Tables 8.3 and 8.4. There is surprising agreement among these diverse studies, which were performed in various populations using nonstandardized methods. It is particularly important to note that the results are influenced by the diagnostic methods used, by the types of agents sought, and by the criteria for documenting etiologic agents. As suggested by the data on normal flora and colonization of the upper airways, the predominant pathogens in communityacquired pneumonia are either members of the normal oropharyngeal flora or are exogenously acquired organisms such as Legionella species, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and viruses. S. pneumoniae no longer occupies the overwhelmingly predominant position of earlier decades, but it still accounts for a substantial minority of infections. The switch to gram-negative pathogens, including P. aeruginosa, and traditional hospital pathogens, such as S. aureus, is evident in the causes of nosocomial pneumonia. 110 It is important to document local conditions, because both pathogens and their susceptibilities to antimicrobial agents may vary greatly. The presence of potential pathogens in the local environment and the existence of effective means for transmission of microbes to patients accounts for some variation, as demonstrated by epidemics of Legionella 111 and Aspergillus ll2 infection. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus, enteric gram-negative bacilli, and non-glucose-fermenting gram-negative bacilli such as species of Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter may cause local problems because of patterns of practice, including use of antibiotics, and because of susceptibility of particular patient populations. 113 Molecular diagnostic tools may be useful for dissecting the epidemiology of the infec-tionsY4-116 Special epidemiologic intervention, such as isolation of patients, reinforcement of hand-washing technique, and restriction of antibiotic use, may be necessary to control the spread of drug-resistant pathogens. 1 17 Risk Factors for Development of Bacterial Pneumonia",

Those studies that utilize multivariate analysis and logistical regression are particularly instructive because they help to eliminate variables that are not independent risk factors. The quality of the information, not surprisingly, is considerably higher for nosocomial infection, because the population of patients at risk can be defined more precisely and appropriate controls identified more readily than can be done in community-acquired pneumonia. It is nevertheless obvious that many of the risk factors are similar. In many instances the documented risk factors reflect variables that are operative in the pathogenesis of pneumonia. Conditions that predispose patients to aspiration, such as depressed consciousness from neurologic disease, anesthesia, or prolonged intubation, are prominent on the list. It is important to recognize that intubation does not prevent aspiration; in fact, the violation of laryngeal integrity by a foreign body may foster episodes of aspiration. It is well established that the tubing of modem ventilators, equipped with cascade humidification systems, become contaminated by flora that originated in the patient.ll8 These tubes provide a source for a bacterial inoculum that can be dumped back into the patient's lower respiratory tract as the patient is moved about. This mechanism may be responsible for the surprising finding that the increased manipulation caused by daily tubing changes actually increases the risk of pneumonia. 119 A recent development is the appreciation that bacterial colonization of the stomach may be an important source for aspirated bacterial inocula. 120 Gastric stress ulcers are a common complication of serious illness, but many common therapeutic approaches, such as administration of antacids or H2-antagonists, have the undesirable side effects of reducing gastric acidity and allowing bacterial proliferation. Several studies have documented that the use of sucralfate, which does not increase the pH of the stomach, results in lower rates of nosocomial pneumonia. 121 ,122 Other studies, however, also conducted in a prospective and doubleblind fashion, failed to demonstrate any difference in pH, bacterial colonization or the development of pneumonia between ICU patients receiving sucralfate versus antacids. 123 The reader is referred to a recent review by Bonten and colleagues,124 which probes these disparities in reports while offering several insightful explanations.",

            "text": "An additional group of risk factors includes conditions that reduce the effectiveness of pulmonary defense mechanisms, such as chronic obstructive lung disease and smoking. Alcohol intoxication and anesthesia may increase the risk of pneumonia by increasing the frequency of aspiration, but experimental intoxication of rabbits suggested many years ago that interference with migration of leukocytes into the air spaces may be an additional mechanism for enhanced susceptibility.115 Although viral infections were not identified as a risk factor in these studies, bacterial superinfection has been a long recognized complication of influenza epidemics and also occurs in sporadic infection. 125 ,126 In fact, mortality tables compiled by federal health authorities have traditionally combined pneumonia and influenza data.127,128 Experimental studies in mice suggest that one mechanism for adverse effects of viral infection may be impairment of lung clearance of inhaled particles, presumably related to the destruction of ciliated epithelium. 53 In addition to factors that compromise anatomic and epithelial defenses, diseases or therapy that compromise inflammatory and immunologic defense mechanisms are of critical importance. These diseases may be hereditary deficiencies in immunoglobulinsl29-131 or in phagocytic function. 132 More commonly, neoplastic disease is the cause of the immunosuppression, either directly or indirectly as a result of antitumor chemotherapy.133\u00b7134 Patients who have received immunosuppressive therapy after organ transplantation represent another important risk group.135-137 Although compromise in specific immunologic defenses is undoubtedly important, concomitant neutropenia is perhaps the most important risk factor. 138 The diminution in inflammation may cause atypical clinical presentations. Radiologic findings, the equivalent of gross pathologic examination, may be altered dramatically by the minimal inflammatory response. 139 ,l40 Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection has now joined the ranks of important immunosuppressive conditions. Although attention has been focused on fungal, parasitic, and viral infections in patients with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, bacterial infections are also significantly increased. 141-147 The pathogens that infect patients with HIV infection are the same colonizing bacteria that cause community-acquired and nosocomial pneumonia in immunologically competent patients: S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, H. inJluenzae, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, etc. 148 The clinical and radiographic presentations of the disease may be atypical, however, perhaps because of the prophylactic use of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for prevention of Pneumocystis jiroveci (carinii) pneumonia. 142 The radiographic picture of bacterial pneumonia in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome may actually mimic Pneumocystis infection. A special risk group for severe pneumonia is the increasingly large elderly population.149-152 The etiologic agents and specific risk factors are not distinctive, although gram-negative organisms may be slightly more prevalent. 153 They present ever-increasing challenges in this group of patients.",

Many authorities use a combination of clinical, radiologic, and microbiologic findings to characterize the certitudedefinite, probable, or possible-of the diagnosis. 1 57 The most sensitive and specific means for an etiologic diagnosis of pneumonia is lung biopsy, but it is rarely necessary to resort to this extreme. The diagnostic approach to most pneumonias is graded, starting with the least invasive procedure. Common bacterial agents have usually been eliminated from consideration by the time w.e. Winn, Jr., et al. the surgical stage is reached. If lung tissue is presented to the pathologist, however, it is important that a portion of the tissue be removed for bacterial culture if the surgeon has not submitted a separate biopsy to the microbiology laboratory. Any clinical considerations that might suggest special culture media, such as the possibility of legionnaires' disease, should be conveyed to the microbiologist so that special culture media can be inoculated. It is useful to freeze at -70\u00b0C uninoculated tissue from any source so that additional microbiologic evaluations may be carried out if unsuspected histologic findings redirect diagnostic considerations.",

There is no adequate gold standard in this area. Lung tissue is usually not available for culture. Isolation of an organism from blood or pleural fluid provides a solid diagnosis (100 % specificity), so these cultures should be performed when appropriate in seriously ill patients. Reliance on culture of sterile body fluids is insufficient, however, because many pneumonias are not associated with infectious pleurisy or bacteremia. Bacterial pneumonia is accompanied by dissemination of bacteria through the bloodstream in only 20% to 30% of cases. 158 A variety of methods has been developed to diagnose bacterial pneumonia without surgical biopsy. Two percutaneous aspiration techniques avoid passage of the diagnostic instrument through the upper airways. Needle aspiration of pulmonary lesions that have been defined by chest radiograph has been employed primarily in children but also in adults.159-I61 The procedure may be fluoroscopically guided. Direct aspiration provides a specific diagnosis, the few false positives being derived from the overlying skin. The sensitivity of the technique is more difficult to gauge, but may be enhanced by the addition of immunologic or molecular methods, particularly in patients who have received prior antibiotic therapy. 162 The most common complication is pneumothorax, which is easily treated and not usually associated with infectious pleurisy. Serious morbidity is variously estimated to be rare I59 or frequent. 161 Although this procedure is not widely performed at the present, proponents have analyzed the cost-benefit ratio more thoroughly. I 63,164 Alternatively, transtracheal aspiration has been employed to obtain uncontaminated lower respiratory secretions. 165 This technique has fallen from favor in many institutions because of occasional complications.

Assessment of bacteria in areas of the smear that are inflammatory and do not contain squamous epithelial cells provides useful information with which to interpret the results of culture. Assessment of pneumococci is particularly difficult because of the frequent presence of viridans streptococci in the specimens.

Protected specimen brushes of distal bronchioles provide the most accurate specimens.180J81 Chastre and colleagues 182 compared the results of this technique with lung biopsy in patients immediately after death (a study made possible by a change in French law regarding postmortem examination). They found an excellent correlation between the techniques when more than 10 3 colony-forming units of a bacterium per milliliter were present. Since then, a number of remarkably similar comparison studies have been conducted on recently deceased patients. Some of these investigations demonstrated good correlation among postmortem histology, lung tissue culture results, and different bronchoscopic-guided sampling techniques. [183] [184] [185] On the other hand, many studies have failed to affirm any significant differences in diagnostic accuracy between initial clinical/radiographic findings, noninvasive specimen collection techniques, and bronchoscopic-guided sampling procedures. 18 6-189 It is important to remember that the quantitative threshold for positivity (a likely etiologic role for the bacterium) varies considerably between studies as well as between sampling techniques. Direct comparisons, therefore, should be made with caution. Similarly, although histologic diagnosis was considered the gold standard in all of these comparative studies, Corley et al. 190 demonstrated considerable interobserver variability among four pathologists in defining the mere presence or absence of pneumonia. Finding intracellular bacteria in more than 25% of cells 191 or demonstrating more than 10 respiratory epithelial cells 192 in fluid obtained by cytospin analysis of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid have been proposed as indicators of pneumonia.

When compared to the Gram stain, silver impregnation procedures provide much greater sensitivity for detecting small numbers of either gram-positive or gram-negative bacteria. Once bacteria are detected, a modification of the Gram stain can be applied to replicate tissue sections to determine Gram reactivity of the organisms. Most mycobacteria, particularly the Mycobacterium avium complex, not only appear acid fast after staining with the Ziehl-Neelsen procedure, but also are weakly gram positive and stain positively with the periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)196 and Grocott's methenamine silver procedures in fixed paraffin-embedded tissue sections. (See also Chapter 9.) Auramine or auramine-rhodamine may be used to screen sections efficiently for acid-fast bacilli if a fluorescence microscope is available. A mercury light source is not required, as halogen lamps emit light efficiently in the exciting range for these dyes. The fluorescent methods are more sensitive than the Ziehl-Neelsen procedure and it is easier to screen sections quickly, but it is more difficult to assess the morphology of putative bacilli and to characterize correctly nonbacterial acid-fast material that may be abundant in sections. The routine acid-fast stain for most laboratories should be the Ziehl-Neelsen procedure, unless an observer is familiar with the fluorescent stains. A modified decolorization procedure should be employed only if a partially acid-fast bacterium is suspected. It should be noted that the fluorescent acidfast stains operate on the same principles as the Ziehl-Neelsen stain; they are not immunologically specific procedures.",

The decolorization provided by the Putt modification of the acidfast stain is more gentle than that provided by the Fite or Fite-Farraco procedures.

Therefore, a middle ground must be sought in which a moderate but not overwhelming number of organisms is present. It is not a good idea to use an \"all-purpose\" control, such as colonic material that contains mixed morphotypes. An appropriately screened control that contains gram-positive cocci and gram-negative bacilli may be useful, however. Jung 198 described a method for creating fibrin substrates into which cultured bacteria may be placed before fixation and embedding. If the stain is intended to detect a \"difficult\" organism, such as the Brown-Hopps stain for Legionella, it is important to use a control that matches the task; good coloration of E. coli is no assurance that Legionella will be visualized similarly.",

Microscopically, the predominant cell in the alveolar exudate is the polymorphonuclear neutrophil. Most erythrocytes have lysed and the fibrin net is less obvious. At this stage the inflammatory exudate is undergoing lysis. Cells stain poorly, their outlines are indistinct, and hemosiderin pigment may be evident. The interstitial blood vessels are no longer engorged and occasionally megakaryocytes, released from the bone marrow during the outpouring of leukocytes, may be trapped in the capillaries. In pneumococcal lobar pneumonia the bacteria stain well and are still viable during the stage of red hepatization, but are poorly stained and nonviable once the gray hepatization phase is reached. The time course for the inflammatory process is variable, with the duration of the red and gray hepatization phases being estimated at 2 to 3 days each. The time of maximum consolidation has been variously estimated to be 2 days20S or 3 to 6 days. 206 The physical effects of the extensive inflammatory consolidation are emphasized by the observation that an artificial pneumothorax produces little, if any, collapse of the affected lung. 207",

The latter names illustrate the association of the inflammation with the bronchial tree, but they are misnomers because the inflammatory process is essentially a disease of the air spaces-the respiratory bronchioles, alveolar ducts, and alveoli. Lobular pneumonia is an accurate description of the most common variant of focal pneumonia. A paper-mounted whole-lung section (Gough section) illustrates clearly the association of inflammation with the centrilobular portion of the pulmonary lobule (see Fig. 8 .3). The heavy carbon deposition in the patient, who was a cigarette smoker, clearly delineates the terminal bronchioles at the center of the lesions. The pathogenetic mechanisms are similar to those at work in lobar pneumonia. The stages of consolidation are not so well described as in lobar pneumonia, but undoubtedly follow a similar pattern. Spread of the infection is probably through the bronchial tree from lobule to lobule, segment to segment, and lobe to lobe. Extension from alveolus to alveolus through the pores of Kohn probably occurs also.",

Consolidation may appear lobar by radiographic analysis 209 but be characterized as confluent lobular pneumonia when examined at autopsy. 210 Similarly, the etiologic associations are not precise. S. pneumoniae is the classic agent of lobar pneumonia, but frequently produces focal consolidation. Conversely, other agents may on occasion cause a lobar consolidation. Although S. aureus pneumonia is usually described as a focal process, Chartrand and McCracken 199 described a radiographic picture of lobar pneumonia as the most frequent presenting manifestation of infection in 79 infants and children. A factor in characterizing the infections may be the relative imprecision of chest radiographs in defining the exact anatomic distribution of infiltrates. The radiograph is the only tool that clinicians have to assess the distribution in most cases, however, so it is important to realize the limitations of the technique.",

One group of investigators has described the presence of elastin fibers in KOH preparations of sputum as a more sensitive documentation of necrotizing pneumonia than radiographic visualization of cavities. 223 Necrotizing pneumonia and lung abscess in nonhospitalized patients are often associated with mixed infections of anaerobic bacteria and aerobic members of the oral microflora. 35.36.224 The lesions are often large and single ( Fig. 8.17 ).

Hematogenous dissemination from a primary pulmonary focus can involve almost any organ, but the brain, subcutaneous tissue, bones, joints, heart, and peritoneum are most often affected. The term nocardiosis refers to the disseminated disease in which nocardial filaments are randomly scattered within the invaded tissue.

The filaments are often beaded, and fragmented bacillary and coccoid forms are occasionally seen. Isolates can be identified in culture by studying their physiologic and biochemical properties. 305 ,317,318 Nocardiosis occurs three times as often in males as in females. It usually presents as either a chronic pneumonia in apparently immunocompetent individuals or as an acute, progressive pneumonia in immunodeficient patients.319-326 Symptoms of pulmonary infection mimic those of tuberculosis and include fever, chills, dyspnea, cough, hemoptysis, chest pain, night sweats, and weight loss. Chest radiographs, which are nonspecific, usually reveal bilateral infiltrates and thin-walled cavities. Therapy consists of surgical drainage combined with high doses of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole or penici Ilins. 305,317 ,318,327 The inflammatory response in nocardiosis is typically suppurative and necrotizing, leading to sinus tracts and encapsulated abscesses. 306 In chronic infections, multiple abscesses filled with thick, greenish-yellow, odorless pus are separated by areas of fibrosis (Fig. 8.29 ) . The abscesses, which vary from 1 to 10mm or more in diameter, are filled with neutrophils and macrophages. In chronic infections, epithelioid histiocytes and multinucleated giant cells are usually present at the periphery of the abscesses. The overall appearance of nocardiosis differs somewhat from actinomycosis in that the abscess cavities are less In both acute and chronic lesions, individual nocardiae are diffusely distributed in the inflammatory exudate. The organisms appear as delicate, beaded filaments, ~lllm in width, that branch at predominantly right angles (Fig.  8.30 ). 306.328.329 In tissue sections the no cardiae are readily demonstrated with Grocott's methenamine silver stain (Fig. 8.31 ) and by a modified Gram's stain, such as Brown and Brenn or Brown-Hopps (Fig. 8.32 ). They are not reli- ably stained, however, with H&E, PAS, and Gridley fungus procedures.

Infection occurs when spores of B. anthracis enter the body via percutaneous implantation, inhalation, or ingestion. The four major clinical forms of anthrax are cutaneous (malignant pustule), septicemic, pulmonary, and gastrointestinal. J9 The malignant pustule is the most common form and accounts for 95% of all infections. 19 ,334,335 Patients with pulmonary anthrax typically have no predisposing underlying illness, and the disease has a rapid onset characterized by fever, extreme weakness, nonproductive cough, severe dyspnea, tachycardia, and cyanosis.

Microscopically, pulmonary hemorrhage was noted in two patients who died within 48 hours of onset, but neither vascular inflammation nor thrombosis was seen. Later in the process the air-space infiltrate was primarily mononuclear, except in areas of necrotizing inflammation where polymorphonuclear neutrophils predominated. Macroscopic abscesses were noted in two patients. The prevalence of E. coli pneumonia in the elderly has been emphasized by several authors.410.411 The pulmonary infiltrates were described radiographically as patchy; dense consolidation occurred in only a minority. Berk and colleagues,411 who examined the isolates for the K1 capsular polysaccharide antigen, found six of 17 strains with this characteristic, which has been associated with neonatal infections. Sputum contained the causative organism in most of the bacteremic cases. 409 -411 Enterobacter spp.",

This bacterium has a venerable and colorful history, often related to the bright red pigment that many isolates produce. Raphael's fresco, The Mass of Bolsensa, commemorates the miraculous appearance of blood on the Eucharistic wafer, now interpreted as contamination of the bread by S. marcescens. This organism was once considered a harmless commensal, to be swabbed on the hands of medical students in epidemiology demonstrations or released into the environment as experiments in biological warfare. 414 Outbreaks of nosocomial infection w.e. Winn, Jr., et al. were associated with some of the military aerosol experiments, but retrospective analysis has suggested that the associations were fortuitous. Rather, the outbreaks called attention to nosocomial infections that had not been recognized previously. S. marcescens may cause infections as a member of the patient's indigenous flora, after transfer on the hands of medical personnel or through contamination of therapeutic or diagnostic reagents. 41S Most patients have serious underlying disease. The etiologic agent is usually isolated from sputum, where it must be differentiated from colonizing flora. A minority of patients develop bacteremia. S. marcescens was recovered only at postmortem examination in seven of 40 patients reported by Goldstein and colleagues. 217 The radiographic 416 and pathologic 217 features of nosocomial Serratia pneumonia at one institution have been described. Goldstein and associates 217 reviewed the pathologic findings in 40 cases of pneumonia in which S. marcescens was isolated, including 16 cases in which the bacterium was isolated in pure culture. The pathologic response differed in patients who were neutropenic and those in whom the circulating neutrophils were intact. The most common macroscopic appearance was focal consolidation and focal hemorrhage, which occasionally became confluent. The radiographic analysis of cases from this institution included two cases in which the distribution was described as lobar, perhaps reflecting the difficulty of differentiating confluent focal pneumonia from lobar consolidation radiographically. 416 In the neutropenic patients the lungs were diffusely edematous and hemorrhagic.",

Opie described the association of the gram-negative bacillus with purulent bronchitis in his patients, as opposed to the isolation of the gram-positive cocci more commonly from lung parenchyma. That association has been noted also by modern investigators, who were unable to distinguish clinically acute febrile tracheobronchitis from pneumonia except for the absence of radiographic infiltrates in the former. 451 MacCallum 125 also emphasized the bronchial association of the lesions in H. injluenzae pneumonia, but challenged the etiologic association with the influenza syndrome. Some years later Pittman 452 defined the existence of strains that had polysaccharide capsules and others that were unencapsulated. Pittman noted the antigenic differences among the encapsulated isolates and first suggested that the type B strains were associated with severe bacteremic disease. The matter was finally settled when Smith and colleagues 453 isolated influenza virus by inoculation of ferrets in 1933. Meanwhile, deliberation as to the exact role of a preceding viral respiratory infection in the pathogenesis of H. injluenzae pneumonia continues. 454 MacCallum 125 noted a purulent exudate in the bronchi where the gram-negative bacilli could be demonstrated readily.

A few years later astute investigators in Charlottesville, Virginia,499 and Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania,51l0 recognized an unusual combination of events: acute purulent pneumonia in immunosuppressed patients, the presence of acid-fast bacilli in sections, and cultures negative for bacteria and mycobacteria. Using techniques that had been employed in the investigation of the American Legion epidemic, the Pittsburgh investigators isolated a gram-negative bacillus that was originally called the Pittsburgh Pneumonia Agent and later classified as Legionella micdadei. This species has the unusual characteristic of partial acid-fastness in tissues and secretions but not after growth on agar. The bacterium also undergoes morphologic transformation ultrastructurally, which may correlate with the changes in acid-fastness. 501 Surgical pathologists can learn a lesson from this experience: When the population of patients is sufficiently immunosuppressed and either clinicalor pathologic markers of infection are present, use of a battery of special stains should be encouraged. The rules that define which organism should be sought as an etiologic agent for a certain type of inflammation must be thrown out the window. Appropriate special stains are discussed in the section on Morphologic Detection and Identification of Bacteria, above.",

Winn, Jr., et al. one of seven autopsied cases of L. micdadei pneumonia. 211 An expected etiology for diffuse alveolar damage was usually present, but some cases could not he explained by factors other than Legionella, and a lung biopsy was reported in which diffuse alveolar damage was the only pathologic finding. 225 Coagulative necrosis, which is present in a minority of cases and may mimic pulmonary infarcts, may be associated with vasculitis. 211 \u2022 503 Small pulmonary vessels are infiltrated with inflammatory cells and often contain thrombi (Fig. 8.51 ). In contrast to Pseudomonas vasculitis, bacteria are infrequent in the damaged blood vessels. Vasculitis may occur without coagulative necrosis, however. In one series vasculitis was seen in 16 of 53 cases of L. pneumophila pneumonia (30%), but coagulative necrosis was found in only six cases, all of which contained inflamed blood vessels. 211 Ultrastructural examination of tissues has expanded our knowledge of the cellular interactions with Legionella and provided some useful pathogenetic clues. 50l . 52 ! The initial ultrastructural examinations documented the gram-negative cell wall structure of the bacteria and the close association of the bacteria with macrophages in the air-space infiltrate (Fig. 8.52 ). Most of the specimens were obtained at autopsy, however, and cells were insufficiently preserved to make definitive observations of subcellular structure. Glavin and colleagues 522 examined three lung biopsies that had been freshly fixed in glutaraldehyde solution. They noted the association of phagocytosed Legionella with alveolar macrophages (Fig. 8 .53) but also described phagocytosed organisms in polymorphonuclear neutrophils. They further noted that the intracellular bacteria were in vacuoles that had closely apposed, ribosome-like structures (Fig. 8.54 ). This association of bacteria with ribosome-studded phagosomes has been noted experimentally also. 523 The association appears related to intracellular parasitism, but the precise function associated with the physical relationship is not known. 524 Legionella spp. can be demonstrated in tissue readily, a considerable irony because the failure to visualize them delayed the recognition of the cause of the Philadelphia outbreak. As usual, the task is easy once the ground has been broken. A monoclonal fluorescent reagent that reacts with all serogroups of L. pneumophila is commer- cially available. This reagent has the advantage of good specificity, but does not detect other species.525.526 Even the monoclonal reagent, however, may cross-react with other bacteria, such as spores of Bacillus cereus 527 and Eordetella pertussis. 528 Polyclonal fluorescent reagents that react with many species have also been evaluated and are commercially available,525,529 but it is important to remember that cross-reactions with other bacterial species will occur. Legionella antigen survives prolonged formalin fixation and processing for paraffin-embedded sections, so that special manipulations are not needed to visualize the bacteria in archival material (Figs. 8.55 and 8.56 ). If formalin-fixed tissue is available, a much simpler method for preparation of smears is to scrape the surface of fibrinous lesions with a scalpel blade and transfer the exudate to clean glass slides.",

With some forethought the problem may be avoided, because scrapings from the surface of the lung or impression smears may be prepared and stained with the traditional Gram stain (Fig. 8.57 ). The staining of fastidious gram-negative bacilli can be enhanced greatly by addition of basic fuchsin (0.5 giL) to the safranin counterstain. The successful demonstration of L. pneumophila in tissue was first accomplished reliably by use of the Dieterle silver impregnation stain, first intended for demonstration of spirochetes. 530 ,531 Other silver stains, such as the Steiner (Fig. 8.58 )532 or Warthin-Starri 33 modifications, also stain the bacteria well. The silver-stained bacteria appear larger and more regular than do Gram-stained organisms because of the deposition of silver on the surface of the bacteria. The information on Gram reactivity is lost when the silver impregnation stains are employed. Other stains such as the Giemsa 534 or Gimenez 535 procedures may also be used but offer little additional advantage. All of these chemical stains are immunologically nonspecific. They have the advantage of not being limited by serologic specificity, but they provide little or no information as to the nature of the bacterium.

It is difficult to distinguish between aspiration and bacteremic pathogenetic mechanisms in the reports of human disease. Several lines of evidence suggest, however, that the vasculitis and septic infarcts occur predominantly in pneumonia that is secondary to bacteremia. Although the bacteria are concentrated in the external layers of the blood vessels, identical lesions can be produced experimentally when bacteremia originates in a septic burn wound. The same sequence of events has been described in humans. The concentration of the pulmonary lesions around small arteries and veins, rather than around terminal and respiratory bronchioles, also suggests a vascular focus.

The colonizing bacteria often produce chronic infection with periodic acute exacerbations of symptoms, although the initiation of a colonized state generally heralds a gradual decline in pulmonary function (see Chapter 5).569 Recovery from infection (or \"clearance\") is thought to be hampered by a variety of host and pathogen factors: (1) impaired mucociliary clearance of luminal secretions and organisms, (2) decreased production of antimicrobial peptides (defensins) in alveoli, (3) decreased production of nitric oxide, and (4) the formation of biofilms by the organism.568.570 A close association has been documented between very mucoid strains of P aeruginosa and cystic fibrosis. 297 .568 Rivera and Nicotra 571 suggested that the association may be with bronchiectasis rather than with cystic fibrosis per se.

As occurs with P aeruginosa, infection is associated with a noticeable worsening of the clinical condition, although an acutely fatal form of disease, termed the cepacia syndrome, has become widely recognized. 572 ,573 Reliable recovery of this bacterium from sputum may require selective media to inhibit overgrowth by P. aeruginosa. This species is usually resistant to aminoglycoside antibiotics. The inherent resistance of B. cepacia to antimicrobial agents, its propensity for transmission from person to person (occasionally leading to epidemics among patients who have cystic fibrosis ),572 the severity of clinical manifestations, and the proposals that the organism be used as an agricultural pesticide highlight the prominence of this formerly exotic bacterium as a problem for patients with cystic fibrosis. 573 Tomashefski and colleagues 574 have described the pathologic patterns of B. cepacia pneumonia at autopsy in 40 patients. Lobular or peribronchial pneumonia was the most common pathologic manifestation of infection. Well-delineated yellow peribronchial nodules were present (Fig. 8.61 ).

Chest radiographs usually reveal consolidation or nodular densities of the upper lobes. Cavitation, which occurs frequently, can mimic tuberculosis. 582 ,591 Pleural effusions are uncommon, but a localized pleural mass caused by B. pseudomallei has been reported,592 In chronic suppurative infections, localized lesions occur in the skin, lungs, liver, spleen, lymph nodes, brain, myocardium, bones, and joints. [593] [594] [595] [596] Microscopically the acute form of melioidosis is characterized by multiple discrete abscesses that measure 1 mm to several millimeters in diameter and are most often found in the lungs, liver, and spleen ( Fig. 8.64) . 588,589.597 The abscesses contain neutrophils, macrophages, fibrin, and giant cells that superficially resemble megakaryocytes. If a patient survives the acute infection, epithelioid histiocytes, lymphocytes, and multinucleated giant cells of both the Langhans' and foreign-body types surround the abscess as the lesion becomes granulomatous. 582 ,589.591 In long-standing infections granulomas are often encapsulated by dense fibrous connective tissue. The centers of granulomas consist of either stellate abscesses or caseous necrosis that resembles the lesions of tuberculosis. In the lymph nodes stellate abscesses are similar to those seen in tularemia, cat-scratch disease, and lymphogranuloma venereum. Numerous bacilli of B. pseudomallei that measure 0.8 x 2.0!lm are readily demonstrated within macrophages in acute lesions. The bacilli, however, are very sparse and difficult to detect in the suppurative or caseous centers of the granulomas in chronic lesions (Fig.  8.65 ). Wong and colleagues 597 proposed that the presence of collections (\"globi\") of bacilli within multinucleate histiocytes, detected by a tissue Gram stain, in association with a background of necrotizing inflammation is very characteristic, possibly even pathognomonic of B. pseudomallei infection. Although the Brown-Hopps and Giemsa stains have been recommended for demonstrating B. pseudomallei in tissue sections,589 organisms are much more easily seen with silver impregnation stains, such as the Warthin-Starry, Steiner, and Dieterle procedures ( Fig. 8.65) . Alternatively, conventional Gram stain may be applied to a touch preparation of unfixed lung or a scraping of formalin-fixed pneumonic lung.",

Microscopically abundant fibrin is present in alveoli, and the cellular component of the exudate consists primarily of mononuclear cells (Fig. 8.66 ). As the disease progresses, parenchymal necrosis develops. The necrotic areas may resemble infarcts or geographic foci of caseation. 656 ,657 The vascular changes in acute tularemic pneumonia may be quite pronounced, including extensive thrombosis and necrosis of small and medium-sized arteries and veins (Fig. 8.67 ).

F tularensis stains poorly with tissue Gram stains and is very difficult to demonstrate in histologic sections (Fig. 8.68 ). When present, the bacilli are usually within macrophages and epithelioid histiocytes. Although only faintly Gram negative, the bacterium is intensely argyrophilic when stained with the Steiner, Dieterle, or Warthin-Starry silver impregnation procedures. Diagnosis of the disease requires the bacteriologic isolation of the causative organism; demonstration of a specific immunologic response; detection of the organism by direct immunofluorescence in smears of lesional exudate or in formalin-fixed, deparaffinized tissue sections ( Fig. 8.69 ); detection of antigen by enzyme immunoassay or latex agglutination; or demonstration of species-specific DNA by molecular amplification techniques.346.649.658,659 Roy and colleagues 660 reported crossreactions between L. pneumophila and F tularensis in the direct immunofluorescence test.

Whooping cough was one of the diseases that effective immunization practices had virtually eliminated, but changes in those practices have led to a resurgence of disease in recent decades. 683 The pertussis syndrome is most commonly caused by Bordetella pertussis, a tiny gram-negative coccobacillus.684.685 Bordetella parapertussis may cause a milder syndrome. 686 The clinical syndrome includes an early catarrhal phase, followed by a period of laryngotracheobronchitis, a phase of characteristic paroxysmal cough, and finally a recovery phase. Atypical lymphocytosis may occur, but is inconstant. The differential diagnosis includes viral infection of the lower respiratory tract. 687 In fact, whooping cough and viral infection may coexist in young children (see Fig. 11 .5G in Chapter 11 ). 688 Most cases of whooping cough occur in non vaccinated infants, but cases have been reported in adults,689 including those with waning immunization.69o.691 Infections in adults and immunized patients tend to be mild. B. pertussis, which is found only in humans, is maintained in nature by person-to-person spread, usually with mild or subclinical infection resulting. 690 B. pertussis has been isolated from patients with AIDS and respiratory infections. 692 The clinical diagnosis of pertussis is imprecise,693 and laboratory support is important. The primary diagnostic modality is bacterial culture,694 but the bacterial colonies require several days to develop.

The agents of actinomycosis occur as commensals of the mouth, throat, gastrointestinal tract, and vagina of healthy individuals.306.711-713 These endogenous microorganisms are opportunists that have the capacity to invade injured tissues and intra abdominal mucosal breaks. Unlike nocardiosis, actinomycosis does not occur preferentially in immunocompromised patients. Because actinomycosis is an endogenous disease, it is not included under mycetoma, despite the fact that its etiologic agents commonly form granules in tissue. The principal agent of actinomycosis in humans is Actinomyces israelii. Other causes of the disease are Actinomyces naeslundii, 714-716 Actinomyces visCOSUS,716-720 Propionibacterium propionicus (formerly Arachnia propionica), 721.722 and, rarely, Actinomyces odontolyticus,723-725 Actinomyces meyeri,726.727 Eubacterium nodatum, 728 and Rothia dentocariosa. Actinomyces spp. and related bacteria may be part of a mixed anaerobic infection, and there is experimental evidence that other bacteria may enhance the pathogenicity of the actinomycetes. 729 Based on the anatomic site of infection, most cases of actinomycosis are classified as cervicofacial, thoracic, abdominal, or pelvic. Cervicofacial infection or \"lumpy jaw\" is the most common clinical form. It may develop without any known antecedent injury to the oral mucosa.710.730 Frequently, however, cervicofacial actinomycosis follows a dental extraction. Less commonly it is a sequel to dental caries, periodontal disease/ 16 or an accidental injury to the oral mucosa. Infected tissues are swollen, firm, and elastic. As the disease progresses, abscesses form and draining sinus tracts emerge. If untreated, the infection may extend upward to involve the sinuses, the orbit, or the cranial bones.",

            "text": "Behbehani and colleagues 74S described morphologic differences among lesions produced by various Actinomyces spp. in experimentally infected mice. The granules of Actinomyces israelii exhibited a peripheral eosinophilic fringe without penetration of polymorphonuclear neutrophils into the granule, and the lesions were still progressing 6 weeks after initiation of infection. In contrast the lesions produced by Actinomyces naeslundii and Actinomyces viscosus were resolving 6 weeks after infection, and the granules were penetrated to varying degrees by polymorphonuclear neutrophils. The granules of A. viscosus showed considerable disintegration, whereas those produced by A. naeslundii remained relatively intact. The agents of actinomycosis can be definitively identified by isolating and identifying them in culture. They grow best at 37\u00b0C on enriched, antibiotic-free media where they form raised, whitish colonies that are either smooth or rough depending on the amount of filamentation. Definitive identification of Actinomyces and related bacteria also can be achieved by immunofluorescence staining of clinical specimens and deparaffinized sections of formalin-fixed tissue. 746 ,747 The major problems in the histopathologic differential diagnosis of actinomycosis are botryomycosis caused by nonfilamentous bacteria and actinomycotic mycetoma caused by the exogenous Nocardia spp. Differentiation is important because each of these diseases is managed differently. Botryomycosis is a chronic, localized bacterial pseudomycosis usually of the skin and subcutaneous tissues. It is caused by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria that form compact aggregates or granules. 306 These granules are almost always bordered by Splendore-Hoeppli material, and, like those of actinomycosis, are found within encapsulated abscesses. In H&E-stained tissue sections, botryomycotic granules are usually indistinguishable from those of actinomycosis because the bacteria that form these granules are poorly stained. Histopathologic differentiation is achieved with tissue Gram stains, such as the Brown-Hopps and Brown and Brenn procedures, which demonstrate bacterial cocci and bacilli in botryomycosis or delicate, branched, gram-positive filaments in actinomycosis.",

The infections are almost always polymicrobial. The anaerobic species most commonly isolated are Prevotella melaninogenica (formerly Bacteroides melaninogenicus), Fusobacterium nucleatum, and anaerobic or microaerophilic gram-positive cocci. The same group of bacteria also causes oropharyngeal infections, such as peritonsillar abscess, and occasionally anaerobic lung infection may accompany infection of the upper airways. 748 Although Bacteroides tragilis is infrequently isolated from the oropharynx, this penicillin-resistant species was isolated from 17% of aspiration pneumonias. 224 Gramnegative aerobes and facultative anaerobes, such as P. aeruginosa and enteric bacilli, were common only in nos-w.e.

A similar group of pathogens is responsible for empyema. 749 Morgenstein and colleagues 750 reported a case of cavitary pneumonia in a 46-year-old man with acute lymphoblastic leukemia in which Leptotrichia buccalis, a member of the family Bacteroidaceae, was isolated from blood cultures. Bartlett 751 described the clinical features of 46 patients with anaerobic bacterial pneumonia. Although virtually diagnostic when present, putrid sputum was noted in only two individuals. There were very few differences between the patients with anaerobic pneumonia and a comparison group with pneumococcal pneumonia. Those with anaerobic pneumonia developed chills less frequently and developed abscesses more commonly than those with pneumococcal infection. The average age of patients was 53 years, but anaerobic pneumonia has been described in neonates. 752 Aspiration pneumonia is often associated with necrotizing pneumonia (Fig. 8.75 ) and lung abscess, probably because of the enzymes produced by many anaerobic bacteria (see also Chapter 5) .",

Draining sinuses usually involve the skin and soft tissues of exposed surfaces such as the hands, feet, and head. Infection often spreads locally to involve contiguous skeletal muscle and bone, but hematogenous or lymphatic dissemination is uncommon. Visceral botryomycosis is rare and usually occurs without concomitant cutaneous or subcutaneous infection. 76 G-762 The lungs, liver, heart, brain, prostate gland, kidneys, and intra abdominal space are most frequently involved. Pulmonary botryomycosis can be either primary or secondary. The upper lobes are involved more frequently than are the lower lobes. 763 .764 Clinical findings include dyspnea, pleuritic chest pain, cough, fever, and hemoptysis. The principal agent of botryomycosis is S. aureus. Agents less frequently encountered include P. aeruginosa, E. coli, Actinobacillus lignieresi, Neisseria mucosa, and species belonging to the genera Bacillus, Bacteroides, Proteus, and Streptococcus. 755-758.762.765 In lesions and purulent exudates that drain from sinus tracts, botryomycotic granules appear as soft, yellow or white, organized bacterial aggregates (microcolonies) that range from 0.2 to 2.0mm in diameter. One or more granules are embedded in an abscess that is usually surrounded by epithelioid histiocytes, multinucleated giant cells, and fibrous connective tissue. The bacteria within botryomycotic granules are usually hematoxylinophilic, are embedded in an amorphous eosinophilic matrix or ground substance, and are intimately surrounded by brightly eosinophilic, radiating clubs of Splendore-Hoeppli material (Fig. 8.76 ). The bacterial cocci or bacilli that form the granules are best demonstrated with modified Gram stains, such as Brown-Hopps (best for gram-negative bacteria) or Brown and Brenn (best for gram-positive bacteria).

In other organs, including the lung, these areas vary from gray-tan to yellow. Smaller nodules are more solid, but necrosis is frequent even in these, and may lead to cavitation. Some lesions extend across pulmonary fissures. 774 Histologically the background architecture may be obliterated, but at the edges alveolar filling may be seen. Multiple granular-to-vacuolated von Hansemann's histiocytes are seen better at higher power ( Fig. 8.77 ). These consist of histiocytes with distinct cytoplasmic borders and cytoplasmic granules that vary greatly in size. These granules stain positively with PAS, with and without diastase digestion; they are lipid rich on frozen sections. Round intracytoplasmic blue-gray target-like or owl's-eye-like Michaelis-Gutmann bodies are important findings in confirming this disorder (Fig. 8.77 ).

They tend to have a central or eccentric dark mass surrounded by a clear zone with peripheral accentuation and may stain with iron and calcium stains. Analysis by Crouch et al. 776 has shown some variation in the amounts of calcium, phosphorus, and iron among individual bodies examined.

He called the complex \"intestinal lipodystrophy\"; it has also been called \"lipogranulomatosis.\" As these names do not adequately describe the variety of organs that can be involved or the true character of the process, most authors now refer to the disease simply as Whipple's disease. Whipple himself originally noted that the fat present was mostly intracellular and was probably secondary to chylous drainage obstruction. He also astutely noted some argyrophilicstaining bodies on Levaditi silver stain and suggested these might be bacteria.",

The patient had a progressively worsening cough for 2 years before he developed diarrhea for the first time. His chest radiograph showed bilateral peribronchiolar basilar infiltrates and a diffuse accentuation of an interstitial pattern. Transbronchial biopsy was not diagnostic, but an open lung biopsy showed the diagnostic lesions. A follow-up gastrointestinal biopsy confirmed Whipple's disease. In this case the affected macrophages formed nodules in the interstitium around bronchioles and, to a lesser degree, around blood vessels of all sizes (Fig. 8.78) . Grossly, the nodules were described as firm and white, up to 5 mm in diameter. The typical PAS-positive enlarged histiocytic cells infiltrated both the bronchiolar smooth muscle and bronchiolar mucosa. Plasma cells and lymphocytes were scattered among these cells, but were limited in number. There were no giant cells and no evidence of necrosis or vasculitis. In this case, a large number of typical PAS-positive histiocytes was also noted in the pleural connective tissue, and it was proposed by these authors that pleural biopsy might have been used to make the diagnosis. Electron microscopy showed 0.2 x 1.0 x 1.511m bacilliform structures.",
