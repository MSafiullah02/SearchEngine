In the 1950s, Wallace laboratories, in an effort to maintain secrecy about their new drug, applied the code name Miltown, after the New Jersey borough. When the drug went to market in 1955, the company decided to keep the town name as the trade name.",

The term was coined in 1883 by German anthropologist Erwin B\u00e4lz (1849-1913), who was actually working in Japan and not in Mongolia. In Mexico, the birthmark is called rabo verde, \"green butt,\" and in Spanish the term sometimes used is mancha (\"stain\") de Baelz (B\u00e4lz), eponymously honoring the man who first described it. Mongolian spots generally disappear during later childhood.",
