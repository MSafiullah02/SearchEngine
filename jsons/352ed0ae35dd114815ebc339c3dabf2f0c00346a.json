Early tracheostomy was defined as tracheostomy performed within 7 days of MV. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality, and the secondary outcomes were 28-day mortality, nosocomial pneumonia, length of hospital stay, length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay, duration of MV, duration of sedation, duration of analgesia, duration of delirium, and total hospitalization costs. Propensity scores for early tracheostomy were calculated using a logistic regression model on the following variables: age; sex; body mass index; Japan Coma Scale status at admission; Charlson comorbidity index score; comorbidity of chronic pulmonary disease; complication of pneumonia at admission; complication of hyponatremia at admission; neurological presentation at admission; ambulance use; referral from other hospitals; treatment year; days from hospital admission to MV initiation; ICU admission until the day of MV initiation; and treatments until the day of MV initiation. Stabilized inverse probability of treatment weighting analyses was performed to compare the outcomes between patients with and without early tracheostomy.",

After stabilized inverse probability of treatment weighting, early tracheostomy was not associated with lower in-hospital mortality (risk difference 0.4%; 95% confidence interval \u2212 5.6 to 6.7%) compared with patients without early tracheostomy. There were no significant differences in 28-day mortality (risk difference \u2212 1.3%; 95% confidence interval \u2212 3.5 to 0.9%) and incidence of nosocomial pneumonia (risk difference \u2212 2.6%; 95% confidence .

These entities contribute to a high incidence of respiratory complications, including atelectasis and pneumonia, as a major cause of death [2, [21] [22] [23] .

Propensity scores for early tracheostomy were calculated using a logistic regression model. The independent variables were: age; sex; body mass index; Japan Coma Scale status at admission; Charlson comorbidity index score; comorbidity of chronic pulmonary disease; complication of pneumonia at admission; complication of hyponatremia at admission; neurological presentation at admission; ambulance use; referral from other hospitals; treatment year; days from hospital admission to MV initiation; ICU admission until the day of MV initiation; and treatments until the day of MV initiation. We used the propensity scores to derive stabilized weights, which maintains appropriate type I error by preserving the sample size in the pseudodataset [38] . To assess the performances before and after stabilized IPTW, we compared the covariates using absolute standardized differences, with differences > 10% regarded as an imbalance between the two groups [39] . Stabilized IPTW estimates the average treatment effects over a marginal distribution of measured covariates in the matched cohort.",

Table 4 Outcomes of sensitivity analyses before and after stabilized IPTW, restricted to patients who underwent tracheostomy In the current study, patients who received late tracheostomy or did not receive tracheostomy were analyzed together as a non-early tracheostomy group, because we assumed that the latter were potential candidates for tracheostomy. While the decision to place a tracheostomy in critically ill patients generally depends on the expected length of required MV, the clinical course, severity, and duration of respiratory failure in mechanically ventilated patients with GBS are highly diverse [29] . Although several studies have addressed the identification of predictors for prolonged MV in GBS patients [5, 9, 29, 40] , only limited data are available to provide guidance for decision-making on early tracheostomy at the time of MV initiation. Furthermore, it is difficult to predict the extubation outcome, partly because of the difficulty in evaluating the severity of bulbar palsy and respiratory muscle paralysis during endotracheal tube placement [7, 41] . Currently, these uncertainties about the management of respiratory failure in GBS patients pose challenges for decision-making on performance of early tracheostomy.",

Using stabilized IPTW analyses to adjust for multiple covariates until the day of MV initiation, we assumed that all GBS patients requiring MV for more than 1 week were potential candidates for tracheostomy. However, the decision on whether to perform tracheostomy in GBS patients has often been discretionary. To address the possibility that both relatively mild and fatal GBS patients were biased in the no tracheostomy group, we conducted a sensitivity analysis including only those who received tracheostomy.",

The current study using multicenter, real-world data from Japan showed that the median time to tracheostomy was 12 days, and only about 15% of GBS patients who received MV for more than 1 week underwent early tracheostomy within 7 days of MV. However, there was a trend toward early tracheostomy in GBS patients becoming more common during the study period. A similar trend was observed in the USA [45] . This trend may reflect the fact that physicians expect potential clinical benefits from early tracheostomy. We expected that mortality and the incidence of nosocomial pneumonia, as one of the major causes of death in GBS, would be reduced in the early tracheostomy group [2, [21] [22] [23] ; however, the current study showed no significant association of early tracheostomy with either of these variables. Furthermore, all other secondary outcomes associated with expected effects of early tracheostomy showed no significant differences. The current sensitivity analysis restricted to patients who underwent tracheostomy did not change the main results. These results may be partly explained by difficulties with pulmonary hygiene under conditions of bulbar palsy and respiratory muscle paralysis during the progression phase irrespective of the use of early tracheostomy.",

A retrospective observational study (n = 61), which was a rationale for the recommendation, reported a period of 8-10 days from ICU admission to the end of immunotherapy [9] . The results of the current study may thus support the proposal to perform tracheostomy in GBS patients judged to be at high risk for prolonged MV after the completion of immunotherapy.",

            "text": "Several limitations should be acknowledged when interpreting the results of the current study. First, the study had a retrospective observational design, and the assignment of early tracheostomy was not random. Unfortunately, because of data unavailability, the study could not account for pulmonary function tests, arterial blood gas analysis, ventilator settings, and reintubation events. Although we used stabilized IPTW analyses to control for possible measured confounders, our results may have been biased by unmeasured confounders regarding the severity of GBS-associated respiratory failure and GBS itself. However, time from hospital admission to MV initiation [6] , neurological presentations at admission [36] , and complications at admission [6, 33, 34] were well balanced between mechanically ventilated patients with GBS with and without early tracheostomy. Second, we could not differentiate between percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy and surgical tracheostomy [47] . Moreover, we could not obtain data on tracheostomy-associated complications. Third, the incidence of nosocomial pneumonia may have been underestimated, because we identified a diagnosis of nosocomial pneumonia based on ICD-10 codes [37] . Fourth, it remains unclear whether early tracheostomy was associated with earlier transfer to a nursing or rehabilitation facility [45] . However, length of hospital stay did not differ significantly between the early and nonearly tracheostomy groups. Finally, although our sample size included a relatively large number of mechanically ventilated patients with GBS, the study may have been underpowered. Despite these limitations, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to focus on the effects of early tracheostomy on clinical outcomes in mechanically ventilated GBS patients.",
