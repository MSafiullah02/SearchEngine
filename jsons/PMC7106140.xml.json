The guidelines address nonspecific upper respiratory tract infections (the common cold), acute rhinosinusitis, acute pharyngitis, and acute bronchitis. Although somewhat dated, the guidelines continue to provide basic diagnostic and management information for acute rhinosinusitis and the common cold and are available for electronic download from the CDC's Get Smart about antibiotics website (www.cdc.gov/getsmart). The guidelines are summarized here, along with several updates from the current literature.",

However, if the patient is experiencing fever and facial erythema, S aureus should be covered with intravenous antibiotics (eg, nafcillin). In general, oral antibiotic treatment should be continued for 10 days; however, if there is no clinical response after 3 days and depending on initial antibiotic selection, the clinician should either change the antibiotic therapy or refer to an otolaryngologist for aspiration and culture.15 A summary of antibiotic recommendations for acute rhinosinusitis is given in Table 1\n.",

Previous studies have documented that antibiotics are often prescribed inappropriately for patients with viral ARIs. Primary care clinicians need to be familiar with current, evidence-based guidelines for ARIs that promote judicious antibiotic prescribing. In addition, they should keep in mind that inappropriate antibiotic prescribing for ARIs is associated with increased antimicrobial resistance and that withholding antibiotic prescriptions for ARIs does not decrease patient satisfaction.",
