Most scientific reviews and media coverage seem to imply the latter, with the majority of articles/programmes covering the search for replacement antibiotics, such as teixobactin [3], and only a tiny fraction being dedicated to other methods, usually biological, such as vaccination or the use of bacteriophages [4]. The search for these new replacement agents has the same rationale as that of 70 years earlier, i.e., compounds produced by microorganisms for chemical defence against other microorganisms, only in different areas of the globe, or using alternative culturing methods (e.g., teixobactin). Given that we have been spoiled by the ease with which conventional antimicrobial agents are administered, as well as their general availability, it is unsurprising that maintaining the status quo is so desirable. Antimicrobial stewardship clearly means a departure from this situation, and given support (and cooperation) from all sides, can at least cause some arrest in the development of resistant microbes [5].",

The arguments against the utilisation of photosensitisers usually involve facts, e.g., that methylene blue is a coloured, staining material and it requires light activation for significant antimicrobial effects to be achieved. This is insurmountable, i.e., tissue staining is transient and the application of light to the back of the throat is no more invasive than a routine dental examination. However, it is fair to say that the employment of photoantimicrobials would represent a considerable change in anti-infective practice. The question remains whether those involved in delivery can be persuaded to make the change in view of the advantages over the conventional therapy outlined above. ",

Obviously, the clearance of bacterial infection at the stage of tonsillitis (or otitis media, laryngitis, etc.) is preferable, as opposed to dealing with a life-threatening disseminated disease. However, a failing battery of conventional antibacterial drugs means that such progressions will become more common, and the possibility of replacing conventional therapy at this stage with one which neither suffers from nor leads to resistance should thus be attractive.",

Such an approach could be used prophylactically to avoid the spread of infection among close communities (student accommodation, military establishments, and prisons), and has considerable potential against both viral (\u2018flu, coronavirus (COVID)) and bacterial (meningitis) outbreaks.",

It is clear that they are not really being considered for future mainstream use, at least in affluent regions, since they are never mentioned as part of the group of \u2018alternative\u2019 approaches to fighting AMR which is now sometimes listed in government/Non-Government Organisation sources. However, since this listing is very new in such documents, perhaps it reflects a grudging admission that there is any option at all outside the conventional route. Since the alternatives usually given are biologicals, i.e., vaccines and phage therapy, this hardly constitutes scientific adventure, and may, in any case, be too specific for the general, broad-spectrum coverage of infectious disease which will be required.",

This is perhaps unavoidable, given the continuing pre-eminence of the penicillin myth in popular culture and, by extension, the unassailable position of \u2018antibiotics\u2019 in modern infection control. Particularly with cationic photosensitisers, a truly antimicrobial capability in the face of a rapidly elevating resistance crisis is available. Descendants of Fleming\u2019s mould broth, such as the 21st -century carbapenems, are now routinely nullified by resistance mechanisms developed as a result of \u03b2-lactam prophylaxis, or other misuse. Not only does cationic methylene blue kill bacteria which expresses carbapenemase capability (of any type), but it may also be used prophylactically against colonisation by such bacteria without promoting resistance development. Furthermore, protection against viral infection in this way would also both nullify rapid viral mutation rates, as seen, e.g., with COVID-19, and maintain efficacy regardless of strain and antigenic shift/drift such as between serotypes in influenza.",
