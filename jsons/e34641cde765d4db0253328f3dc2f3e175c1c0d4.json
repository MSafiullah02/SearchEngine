            "text": "On March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared COVID-19 as a global pandemic (WHO, 2020) . At the time of this writing, there have been nearly 490,000 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in 171 countries, and nearly 22,000 associated deaths, worldwide. These numbers are growing daily at a remarkable rate (Wu et al., 2020) . To say that we are experiencing a time of societal and economic uncertainty would be an understatement. During times of uncertainty, humans naturally seek explanations for their own and others' social behavior (e.g., Kramer, 1999) . Indeed, people possess an inherent need to make sense of their social worlds, and actively do so through various means, including the construction and adoption of stereotypes (e.g., Hogg, 2000) . To this end, the construction of \"generations\" (e.g., labeling groups of people as \"Baby Boomers\" or \"Millennials\") serves as one way in which we make sense of our social worlds, particularly when we attempt to understand the inherent complexities of aging and development against the impact of major events such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Generations can be defined in multiple ways; however, they typically refer to a group of people born during the same time period, who by virtue of their chronological age similarity have had similar life experiences during their formative years. Such experiences are assumed to have an impact on collective attitudes, values, or behaviors (for a review, see Rudolph & Zacher, 2017) .",

While seemingly benign, these labels have been accompanied by calls for older people and those who are \"not productive\" to step aside to benefit future generations (i.e., literally, to accept death in service of the economy; Fisher, 2020). Others have likewise noted that COVID-19 is leading to a new generational divide (Foroohar, 2020) , with speculation of impending generational warfare as a result (Pancevski et al., 2020) . Likewise, it has been suggested that concerns about contracting COVID-19 fall out along generational lines (Penn, 2020) , as do lines of intergenerational communication about the virus and its transmission (Peterson, 2020; Pariser, 2020b) .",

            "text": "Third, we have observed several attempts at naming \"the COVID-19 Generation. \" For example, there has been speculation of a new \"baby boom\" (Matchan, 2020) and the advent of a new cohort of \"COVID-19 babies\" approximately 9 months from now, resulting from the isolation of couples with time on their hands, and little to do otherwise. Notably, and hinting at an opposing process, there has also been speculation of increased divorce rates stemming from the same process of social isolation (Landsverk, 2020) . This new generation has already been informally dubbed in various ways, including \"Generation Crown\" (a play on \"Corona\"; Frometa, 2020), \"Coronials,\" \"Quaranteens\" (a play on \"quarantine\"; Greep, 2020) , and \"Illenials\" (a portmanteau of \"ill\" and \"Millennials\"; Starcasm, 2020) . Relatedly, there has been speculation that \"Z\" in \"Generation Z\" actually stands for \"Zoom\" (a video Finally, beyond these rather general trends, we also see similar narratives emerging in writings suggesting that the effects of COVID-19 are generationalized, with distinct consequences for work, especially regarding aging and retirement. For example, those \"exiled\" to work from home have been labeled as \"the Corona Virus Generation\" (Lucas, 2020) . Likewise, members of existing younger generations are being classified as particularly well adept at working remotely, with some speculating that nearly universal moves toward working from home to curtail the further spread of the virus satisfy their (assumed) need for such flexibility (Roose, 2020; Withane, 2020) . There has also been speculation that the careers of members of \"Generation X\" will be particularly affected by COVID-19 (Fabbiano, 2020) . Moreover, there is speculation about the fallout of COVID-19 for the retirement of \"Baby Boomers\" (Novack, 2020) , and whether members of \"Generation Z\" will be less likely to contract COVID-19 at work, because they are least likely to engage in physical contact with their coworkers (i.e., compared with members of other generations; Lepore, 2020) .",

First, although the rhetoric surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic is being used to intensify intergenerational conflict in some respects, at the same time, there is also anecdotal evidence for intergenerational support emerging from this pandemic (e.g., younger people helping older people with shopping, Gulland, 2020; grandparents watching younger children so that their parents can work, however ill-advised, McAdams, 2020). Second, and more to our point here, there are emerging attempts to label the effects of COVID-19 in generational and generationalist terms (Rauvola, Rudolph, & Zacher, 2019) . This comes both in the form of differentiating the consequences of COVID-19 for various (assumed) generational groups (e.g., speculating about differential effects of COVID-19 for \"Baby Boomers\" vs. \"Millennials\"), and to ascribe characteristics to a new (assumed) \"COVID-19 Generation. \" Whereas the former behavior reflects the typical sensemaking process that we see with existing generational rhetoric, the latter behavior is largely speculative about how COVID-19 will affect future generations. The speculation around the assumed generational consequences of COVID-19 is the particular issue that we take up here. Specifically, we argue that such speculation presents a variety of problems, which we will discuss next.",

From this, the \"similarly aged people\" component of the substantive definition is termed a \"cohort effect\"which is simply delineated by the year in which people are born (e.g., the \"cohort\" of people born in 2000). Cohort effects (i.e., differences in attitudes, values, or behaviors that can be tied to birth year differences) are typically taken as evidence for the influence of generational differences. For example, taking the birth year as an index of one's generational membership (e.g., the assumption that those born in 20XX are members of \"the COVID-19 Generation\") represents a cohort-based definition of a generation.",

Age effects are typically taken as evidence for the influence of developmental processes, for example, patterns of age-graded personality change and development across adulthood (Nye & Roberts, 2019; Roberts & Mroczek, 2008) . On the other hand, period effects are delineated by the current year (e.g., 2020). Period effects are typically taken as evidence for the influence of contemporaneous time, including the role that important current events play (e.g., economic conditions, national conflicts, one-off events, the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic) in shaping attitudes, values, and behaviors.",

In organizational research, the source typically held constant is period-that is to say, most typically, we collect data at a single timepoint (e.g., in 2020). If period is held constant, any observed variability in these outcomes could be due to either age or cohort effects. For example, assume that we conduct a cross-sectional survey, sampling from a variety of ages and cohorts, but holding period (i.e., year of data collection) constant. In this case, period = age + cohort (e.g., 2020 period = 20 age + 2000 cohort ). This equation can be rearranged too, for example, we can \"solve\" for cohort by \"subtracting\" age from both sides of this equation. In doing so we see that, again holding period constant, cohort = period \u2212 age (e.g., 2000 cohort = 2020 period \u2212 20 age ).",

It is also important to note that the COVID-19 pandemic is a far-reaching, global phenomenon that already has directly affected/infected hundreds of thousands of people, but has a much broader reach, indeed. At this point, COVID-19 is about as close to a homogenous and constant period effect as we could ever observe.

Whereas it could be argued that the resulting economic impact of this pandemic will disproportionately affect marginalized populations (e.g., the poor) and specific sectors of the workforce (e.g., those in precarious work arrangements, those in \"system-relevant\" occupations, self-employed workers), COVID-19 will have far-reaching effects on all workers across all sectors and strata. Although at this point it is difficult to say what the long-term societal impacts of COVID-19 will be, it is safe to say that any divisions that do emerge will not be along generational lines (e.g., the impact could emerge as socioeconomic differences; Muro, Maxim, & Whiton, 2020) . For instance, it is possible that employees working for small and medium-sized businesses will be more severely impacted by the pandemic than employees of large organizations (i.e., with resulting effects on individuals' attitudes, values, and behavior), but it is unlikely that these effects will differ meaningfully across \"generations. \"",

One of the core concerns we have is the potential for generationalism to emerge around attempts to construct and define \"the COVID-19 Generation. \" Generationalism refers to the espoused belief that members of any given generation possess specific, defining characteristics that distinguish them from members of other generations (Rauvola et al., 2019) .",

Although the broader consequences of this rhetoric have yet to be seen, one issue with such speculations is that they set up the possibility for Pygmalion effects to emerge, in that projecting expectations about qualities of individuals may elicit such qualities from those individuals (Rosenthal, 1987) . For instance, if scholars, journals, and policy-makers broadly characterize the \"COVID-19 Generation\" as, for instance, insecure or socially challenged, this may not only lead to age-based discrimination of individuals assumed to belong to this generation, but may also have \"self-fulfilling prophecy\" for these individuals' in terms of their attitudes, values, and behaviors.",

Rather, we would argue that it is very important to think about COVID-19 as an opportunity to study such phenomena as a period effect, and to understand what influence this will have on work-related attitudes, values, and behaviors understood in situ (see Beal & Ghandour, 2011 , for a study that examines experiencing a hurricane as a period effect). As such, we conclude here by offering some suggestions for researchers to consider questions that are actually of relevance now (see also Van Bavel et al., 2020, for research suggestions regarding the COVID-19 pandemic in social and behavioral sciences more broadly). For instance, the need for rapidly deployed, mass work-from-home policies leads to a variety of interesting possibilities, particularly for researchers who study the interface between work and nonwork, including family and caregiving (e.g., Shockley, 2020) . Related to this, it would be particularly important to study how workers in different sectors and occupations suffer disproportionately from this crisis (Gambrell, 2020) , especially those that do not have the possibility to work from home (including \"system-relevant\" occupations, such as doctors, nurses, and public safety officers) or who work in precarious and/or unsafe jobs (e.g., Winkie, 2020) . Researchers may also study the long-term consequences of calls for physical and social distancing on workrelated processes and outcomes (Resnick, 2020) . More broadly, studying the economic impact of this crisis on workers, especially possibilities for unemployment and underemployment and their associated consequences for work attitudes, values, and behaviors are imperative. Relatedly, studying the economic potentials, especially possibilities for hiring and personnel development needs in specific sectors (e.g., healthcare, grocery stores, supply chain logistics) would likewise be of great importance (e.g., Moench, 2020a) . It will also be interesting to understand longer-term potentials for various positive effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on workplaces and interpersonal relationships at work, for example, the increased adoption of \"work from home\" and related time-and-place flexibility policies (e.g., blended work; Van Yperen & Wortler, 2017), the development of enhanced social support among coworkers, as well as increased appreciation for \"system-relevant\" occupations.",

In order to do so, instead of thinking in terms of the generational implications of COVID-19, we would strongly encourage researchers to adopt a life-span developmental perspective on this phenomenon, which focuses on normative age-graded influences (e.g., general increases in emotion regulation abilities with age), normative history-graded influences (e.g., epi-and pandemics), and nonnormative or idiosyncratic influences (e.g., divorce, unemployment) on developmental outcomes (see Baltes, 1987; Rudolph & Zacher, 2017) .",

For example, it has been speculated that older workers are particularly vulnerable to the consequences of COVID-19 and would especially benefit from paid sick leave policies to curtail the spread of the virus (Ghilarducci, 2020) . Another example would be to examine antecedents (e.g., digital competency, emotional stability) and consequences (e.g., occupational well-being, career success) for younger people who successfully manage the school-to-career transition during the pandemic. Overall, it would be interesting to examine how the current pandemic influences the experiences and behavior of workers, not only depending on their chronological age, but also other individual differences (e.g., education, health status, personality) and work-related characteristics (e.g., type of employment, ability to work remotely, organizational support).",

We hope that our cautionary note motivates all of those concerned with work, aging, and retirement to consider the broader picture of COVID-19 and what it means for individuals and workplaces, rather than focusing on, or broadly speculating about, the generational and generationalized implications thereof. We think there is a great opportunity for researchers, organizations, and practitioners to work together to address the challenges facing all workers as we all navigate the COVID-19 pandemic. We challenge each of these constituents to advance such efforts without invoking unnecessary generational framings.",
