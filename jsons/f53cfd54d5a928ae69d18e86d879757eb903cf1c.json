As a proofof-concept, targeted AAVP vectors carrying the HSV-tk suicide gene were investigated as alternative means to assess tumor response to therapy (Hajitou et al., 2008) . Evaluation of transgene expression by PET imaging provided a platform to repeatedly monitor localization and magnitude of gene expression and, thereby, predict the responsiveness to therapy with ganciclovir. Similarly, targeted AAVP vectors delivering an alternative transgene, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF), have been explored in preclinical models of melanoma and, more recently, in spontaneous cancers in dogs through the Comparative Oncology Trials Consortium at the National Cancer Institute (Paoloni et al., 2009; Tandle et al., 2009 ). Finally, further study of the mechanism by which AAVP vectors targeted to the vasculature-mediated tumor therapy has implicated a heterotypic bystander killing effect. This endothelial cell-tumor cell interaction is largely mediated through intercellular gap junctions involving connexins 43 and 26 (Trepel et al., 2009) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 435, "end": 457, "text": "(Hajitou et al., 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 961, "end": 983, "text": "(Paoloni et al., 2009;", "ref_id": "BIBREF63"}, {"start": 984, "end": 1003, "text": "Tandle et al., 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF92"}, {"start": 1306, "end": 1327, "text": "(Trepel et al., 2009)", "ref_id": "BIBREF96"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "III.

VECTORS FOR LIGAND-DIRECTED GENE DELIVERY"}, {"text": "The development of new vasculature occurs during embryonic development, normal physiological processes, and in a number of pathological diseases including most solid tumors. This coordinated, multistage process, termed angiogenesis, involves the local release of growth-promoting factors and subsequent stimulation of endothelial cells lining blood vessels. Activated endothelial cells migrate, proliferate, and invade surrounding tissues, supporting the expansion of tumor cells beyond a critical size (Folkman, 1990; Folkman et al., 1989; Mustonen and Alitalo, 1995) . In addition, it is well established that angiogenic endothelial cells lining tumor blood vessels are morphologically and molecularly distinct Arap et al., 2002; Pasqualini et al., 2001 . The repertoire of cell-surface molecules on angiogenic blood vessels often exist as: (i) new expression of molecules not normally present on quiescent endothelial cells, (ii) elevated levels of proteins normally found at the cell surface, or (iii) rearrangement of cell-surface molecules from luminal or abluminal surfaces. It is this differential expression pattern that suggests an opportunity for site-specific targeting of angiogenic vasculature (Ozawa et al., 2008) . The challenge for the field, however, is the identification and validation of systemically accessible molecules with sufficient specificity and expression to mediate targeting. A number of techniques have been applied in this effort. Genomic approaches rely on expression differences of tumor endothelium compared to normal blood vessels. St Croix et al. utilized microdissection combined with serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) to identify several candidate tumor endothelial markers in human colorectal cancers (Saha et al., 2001; St Croix et al., 2000) . This work demonstrated the feasibility of genetic analyses of cellular subpopulations, including endothelial cells, and the robust potential to identify targets. Moreover, similar studies have since ensued including generation of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) and analysis of cDNA microarrays. Once identified, the candidates must be validated not only as viable proteins but also must be localized to the cell surface and contribute to systemic targeting. Due to some of these inherent limitations to genetic screens, proteomic screenings often provide greater evidence for relevant and functionally significant targets. Beyond the derivation of protein arrays from cellular homogenates, techniques to directly profile the cell surface of endothelial cells have recently emerged, including in vivo screenings with systemically injected biotin derivates or two-dimensional peptide mapping (Roesli et al., 2006a,b; Scheurer et al., 2005) . More recently, a report described proof-of-concept analyses in silico of bioinformatics-based identification of peptides inhibiting endothelial cell proliferation and migration (Karagiannis and Popel, 2008) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 503, "end": 518, "text": "(Folkman, 1990;", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 519, "end": 540, "text": "Folkman et al., 1989;", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 541, "end": 568, "text": "Mustonen and Alitalo, 1995)", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 713, "end": 731, "text": "Arap et al., 2002;", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 732, "end": 755, "text": "Pasqualini et al., 2001", "ref_id": "BIBREF68"}, {"start": 1208, "end": 1228, "text": "(Ozawa et al., 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF61"}, {"start": 1751, "end": 1770, "text": "(Saha et al., 2001;", "ref_id": "BIBREF81"}, {"start": 1771, "end": 1793, "text": "St Croix et al., 2000)", "ref_id": "BIBREF90"}, {"start": 2686, "end": 2710, "text": "(Roesli et al., 2006a,b;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2711, "end": 2733, "text": "Scheurer et al., 2005)", "ref_id": "BIBREF85"}, {"start": 2913, "end": 2942, "text": "(Karagiannis and Popel, 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "IV. LIGANDS FOR TARGETING ANGIOGENIC VASCULATURE"}, {"text": "Our group has extensive experience in the identification of accessible targets on angiogenic vasculature using in vivo phage display (Kolonin et al., 2001) . Phage display is a highly versatile technology that involves genetically manipulating bacteriophage so that peptides or antibodies can be expressed on their surface (Smith and Petrenko, 1997) . This strategy revealed a vascular address system that allows tissue-specific targeting of normal blood vessels and angiogenesis-related targeting of tumor blood vessels. Vascular receptors corresponding to the selected peptides have been identified in blood vessels of normal organs and in tumor blood vessels. Our strategy has shown that it is possible to shed light into selective expression of biologically relevant targets within specialized vascular beds. In the in vivo phage display procedure, phage capable of homing into certain organs or tumors following an intravenous injection is recovered from such phage display peptide libraries. The ability of individual peptides to target a tissue can also be analyzed by this method (Pasqualini et al., 2000 . In brief, phage are propagated in pilus-positive bacteria that are not lysed by the phage but rather secrete multiple of copies of phage that display a particular insert. Phage bound to a target molecule can be eluted and then amplified by growing them in host bacteria. Multiple rounds of biopanning can be performed until a population of selective binders is obtained. In addition, for a higher throughput approach and higher stringency, we have also developed an enhanced approach to phage library biopanning in vivo by screening a number of organs in parallel (Kolonin et al., 2006b) . The amino acid sequence of the recovered peptides is determined by sequencing the DNA corresponding to the insert in the phage genome. Ultimately, this approach allows circulating homing peptides to be detected in an unbiased functional assay, without any preconceived notions about the nature of their target. Aside from their carrier function for targeted gene delivery, the peptides themselves may be used as drug discovery leads for peptidomimetic drugs or for therapeutic modulation of their corresponding receptor(s), given that such receptors can be identified by biochemical or genetic approaches . Binding properties of the peptide library can also be verified for any human or mouse cell line or tissue (Kolonin et al., 2006a) . This biopanning strategy in vivo and on intact cells has several advantages. First, as opposed to purified receptors, membrane-bound proteins are more likely to preserve their functional conformation, which can be lost upon purification and immobilization outside the context of intact cells. Second, many cell-surface receptors require the cell membrane environment to function so that homo-or heterodimeric interactions may occur. Third, combinatorial approaches allow the selection of cell membrane ligands in an unbiased functional assay and without any preconceived notions about the nature of the cellular receptor repertoire; thus, unknown receptors can be targeted.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 133, "end": 155, "text": "(Kolonin et al., 2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}, {"start": 323, "end": 349, "text": "(Smith and Petrenko, 1997)", "ref_id": "BIBREF87"}, {"start": 1088, "end": 1112, "text": "(Pasqualini et al., 2000", "ref_id": "BIBREF67"}, {"start": 1679, "end": 1702, "text": "(Kolonin et al., 2006b)", "ref_id": "BIBREF40"}, {"start": 2418, "end": 2441, "text": "(Kolonin et al., 2006a)", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "IV.
