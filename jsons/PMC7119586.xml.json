Although less is known about hMPV, it is also recognized as a pathogen of clinical relevance, only second to hRSV as a cause of ALRI (Schuster and Williams, 2013). Two subtypes of hMPV (A and B) have been identified by comparison of sequences and by antigenic analysis of viral strains (van den Hoogen et al., 2004).",

The hMPV precursor is slightly shorter (539 aa) than its hRSV counterpart (574 aa) due to a variance of their respective proteolytic processing pathways. While hMPV_F, as in other paramyxoviruses is cleaved at a single site placed immediately upstream of a hydrophobic region, called fusion peptide, hRSV_F is cleaved twice at two polybasic sites separated by a 27 amino acid peptide (Gonzalez-Reyes et al., 2001, Zimmer et al., 2001) (Fig. 1\n). The cleavage site of hRSV_F immediately preceding the hydrophobic fusion peptide is equivalent to the cleavage site of other paramyxovirus F proteins. Once cleavage of hRSV_F is completed, the intervening 27 amino acid peptide is released from the mature protein (Begona Ruiz-Arguello et al., 2002). While hRSV_F is cleaved by furin mainly during transport to the cell membrane, probably in the trans-Golgi network (Collins and Mottet, 1991), hMPV_F is cleaved at the cell surface or in the virus particle by extracellular proteases (Shirogane et al., 2008). In both cases, cleavage generates two chains (F2 end terminal to F1) that remain covalently linked by two disulfide bridges. Hence, the mature Pneumovirinae F protein is a homotrimer of F1 + F2 subunits.",

Once the incoming virus is bound to the surface of the target cell, the F protein is activated by still ill-defined mechanisms to initiate a series of conformational changes, including the formation and refolding of a pre-hairpin intermediate by which the viral and cell membranes are brought into proximity. Final refolding of F in a stable postfusion conformation leads to merging of the two membranes and formation of the fusion pore (Lamb and Jardetzky, 2007). Three-dimensional structures of soluble hRSV_F ectodomains stabilized in either the prefusion (McLellan et al., 2013a, McLellan et al., 2013b) or postfusion conformations (McLellan et al., 2011, Swanson et al., 2011) have been recently solved, providing crucial information to understand the conformational changes that the F protein experiences during membrane fusion. One of these changes involves refolding of HRA and HRB sequences of each F1 subunit in a highly stable coiled-coil structure, dubbed the 6-helix bundle motif (6HB).",

In addition, the hMPV_F cleavage site was replaced with the polybasic cleavage site II of hRSV to facilitate proteolytic processing without added trypsin and the first eight amino acids of the fusion peptide were deleted to avoid aggregation of the trimeric postfusion hMPV_F (Fig. 1A, line 3).",

However, in the case of hRSV_F -and in contrast to hMPV_F- about half of the protein eluted from the gel filtration chromatography as a trimer. The monomeric peak was collected and loaded again onto a second gel filtration column to obtain the profile shown at right of Fig. 1B. To increase the yield of trimeric postfusion hRSV_F, the foldon domain was added at the C-terminus of the ectodomain, before the 6-His tag (Fig. 1B, line 3). Finally, a stabilized prefusion form of hRSV_F (Fig. 1B, line 4) was made by incorporating the mutations described by McLellan et al. for their DS-Cav1 protein (McLellan et al., 2013a). Prefusion hMPV_F could not be made since equivalent stabilizing mutations have not been described yet. All proteins were purified by using Ni2+ columns followed by gel filtration chromatography. They were quality checked by SDS-PAGE (Fig. 1) and electron microscopy (Fig. 5) and in the case of hRSV_F by reactivity with conformation specific MAbs (Fig. 1B). MAb D25 has been reported to be specific of the prefusion conformation of hRSV_F (McLellan et al., 2013b) whereas R145 was found to be specific of the postfusion conformation of the same molecule (Palomo et al., 2014).",

Hybridoma supernatants derived from mouse splenocytes were screened in parallel by ELISA for antibodies binding to both postfusion F and GST-HRA-L-HRB. Three hybridomas that produced such antibodies were selected and cloned twice by limiting dilution. The specificity of the corresponding antibodies was finally confirmed as shown in Fig. 3\n. Fig. 3A demonstrates that the three MAbs MF1, MF2 and MF3 bound efficiently to GST-HRA-L-HRB but not to any of the individual moieties, GST, GST-HRA-L or GST-HRB. Furthermore, the three MAbs efficiently reacted with postfusion soluble trimers of hMPV_F derived from either NL/1/00 (A1 subtype) or NL/1/99 (B1 subtype) strains but not with the monomeric form of the latest protein. As controls, a polyclonal anti-GST (\u03b1-GST) antiserum and an anti-hMPV_F MAb (MF14) were included in Fig. 3 to demonstrate reactivity of GST and monomeric hMPV_F, respectively. MF14 antibody (to be described elsewhere) behaves with hMPV_F as palivizumab (Johnson et al., 1997) does with hRSV_F (see Fig. 4B); i.e., both antibodies recognize epitopes that are shared by their respective monomeric and trimeric proteins.",

Hence, a similar strategy to that described in the previous section was used to obtain murine MAbs that reacted with both post-fusion hRSV_F and GST-HRA-L-HRB. Three hybridomas were thus isolated which produced MAbs 114F, 116F and 117F. These three MAbs specifically bound GST-HRA-L-HRB but not any of its moieties (GST, GST-HRA-L or GST-HRB) (Fig. 4A). Interestingly, MAb 114F was able to bind a previously described double mutant of GST-HRA-L-HRB (S509C/S513C) which could not bind rabbit MAb R145 nor the new murine MAbs 116F and 117F. Therefore, the three murine MAbs described in this study recognize at least two different, although probably highly overlapping epitopes. Additionally, the three MAbs bound soluble hRSV_F stabilized in the post-fusion conformation but they did not react with either the pre-fusion conformation or monomeric F (Fig. 4B). Hence, binding of MAbs 114F, 116F and 117F to hRSV_F is fully dependent on folding of the protein trimer into the postfusion conformation.",

Although HRA can assemble by itself in a coiled-coil helix trimer, the \u03b1-6HB antibodies required incorporation of HRB to the inner core for binding, reflecting the structure acquired when the two heptad repeats are mixed together (Lawless-Delmedico et al., 2000, Matthews et al., 2000).

Hence, we expected that immunizations with soluble forms of post-fusion Pneumovirinae F followed by a boost with the corresponding GST-HRA-L-HRB proteins should preferentially induce antibodies of the desired specificity. This strategy indeed made isolation of MAbs that bound both GST-HRA-L-HRB and postfusion F protein a straightforward process. In our experience, screening of hybridoma supernatants with the chimeric GST-HRA-L-HRB is the most critical step for identification of the desired \u03b1-6HB MAbs, even with alternative immunization protocols. The MAbs thus isolated were unable to bind either monomeric F or prefusion stabilized F protein (in the case of hRSV). Although a few conformation dependent MAbs specific for the F proteins of PIV5 (Bissonnette et al., 2006), hRSV (Palomo et al., 2014) and Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV) (Umino et al., 1990) have been serendipitously found, the procedure used in this study provides a reliable approach to generate post-fusion specific MAbs.",

            "text": "Fig. 1: F proteins used in this study: Diagrams of the hMPV_F and hRSV_F primary structures are shown in line 1 of panels A and B, respectively. The signal peptide (SP), F2 subunit, cleavage sites, fusion peptide (FP), F1 subunit, heptad repeats A (HRA) and B (HRB), transmembrane region (TM), and cytoplasmic tail (Cyt) are denoted, as well as the 27 amino acid peptide (p27), unique to hRSV_F. Cysteines are represented by dots. All other lines of panels A and B show the soluble proteins that were produced and purified as described in Section 2, indicating only the structural features that are not represented in the corresponding full-length polypeptide. Panel (A) hMPV_F of line 2 was generated by introducing a 6-His tag after aa 490 to express a monomeric form of the F protein ectodomain. The hMPV_F of line 3 was produced as a soluble post-fusion F protein trimer by adding the foldon trimerization domain at the C-terminus of the protein ectodomain, replacing the hMPV cleavage site by the polybasic cleavage site II of hRSV_F and deleting the first eight amino acids of the fusion peptide (white rectangle). Panel (B) Line 2 shows the hRSV_F ectodomain, expressed as an uncleaved monomer by changing all basic residues of the furin cleavage sites to Ans. The hRSV_F of line 3 is produced as a soluble postfusion trimer (with the first eight FP amino acids deleted) and that of line 4 as a prefusion trimer, stabilized with the mutations (arrowheads) described by McLellan et al. to stabilize their DS-Cav1 variant (McLellan et al., 2013a). Gel filtration profiles and Coomassie stained SDS-PAGE gels of the purified proteins are shown in the right hand of panels A and B. The upper right hand part of panel B shows sandwich ELISAs of the indicated proteins with MAbs specific for either the postfusion (R145, Palomo et al., 2014) or prefusion (D25, McLellan et al., 2013b) conformations of hRSV_F.",

The HRA (red), HRB (blue) and HRA-L-HRB sequences that were fused to GST are indicated below. Note that HRA is followed by a linker sequence (L, black) encoded by one of the primers used in the amplification. (B) Coomassie blue stained SDS-PAGE gel of the purified proteins indicated in each lane. (C) Serial dilutions of a rabbit serum (abscissa) raised against purified GST-HRA-L-HRB were tested for binding by direct ELISA to either GST or the indicated chimeric proteins. Dotted lines represent preimmune serum binding. (D) Diagram of the depletion protocol used to obtain \u03b1-GST-HRA-L-HRB specific antibodies. Rabbit serum was first loaded onto a column of GST-HRA-L bound to Sepharose (red beads). The unbound material was loaded onto a second column of GST-HRB (blue beads) and unbound antibodies (tentatively named \u03b1-6HB) were collected and saved.
