FIP is a sporadic disease caused by mutation of an endemic virus (feline coronavirus, FCoV).\n17\n Inheritance of susceptibility to FIP previously has been described for Persians and Birmans,\n17\n and an overrepresentation of other breeds also has been described.\n17\n As cats would not be covered for death because of FIP occurring within a year after the start of insurance, and because FIP can be challenging to confirm,\n17\n the number of FIP cases may be even higher than shown here. Regardless, infections dominated by FIP were the most common diseases in Birmans up to 12 years of age. One contributing factor to the high incidence of infections in Birmans may be that a number of cats with ascites or hydrothorax because of restrictive cardiomyopathy are falsely diagnosed as having exudative FIP. Death because of cardiovascular reasons was the 3rd most common cause in Birmans, and these diagnoses can be difficult to differentiate without further clinical testing, such as echocardiography.\n18\n\n",

However, we found both of these unlikely to account for the magnitude of the differences seen. As regards statistics, given that the method is stratified on and uses the available information at each age span to calculate the statistics, if there were no cats or deaths in an interval (ie, \u201cyoung\u201d), problems may arise at older ages, but this was not the case here. It is anecdotally assumed that owners are more willing to access veterinary care for their cats and to engage in treatment for chronic diseases (eg, diabetes) than was the case in the past. Presumably, increased access to veterinary care would be facilitated by having health care insurance (which almost all life\u2010insured cats have). A similar pattern of decreased mortality over time has been shown in dog data from the Agria database (Brenda Bonnett, personal communication). The extent to which increased survival can be attributed to veterinary care per se or to the attitudes of owners with regard to willingness to treat older animals and those with chronic disease is impossible to determine based on our results.",
