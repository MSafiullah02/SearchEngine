Daily confirmed cases, air pollution concentration and meteorological variables in 120 cities were obtained from January 23, 2020 to February 29, 2020 in China. We applied a generalized additive model to investigate the associations of six air pollutants (PM 2.5 , PM 10 , SO 2 , CO, NO 2 and O 3 ) with COVID-19 confirmed cases. We observed significantly positive associations of PM 2.5 , PM 10 , NO 2 and O 3 in the last two weeks with newly COVID-19 confirmed cases.
