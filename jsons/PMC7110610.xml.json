Laboratory SARS-CoV confirmation tests are therefore a critical clinical need. Detection of specific SARS-CoV antibodies has been a reliable way to confirm the diagnosis.

Recently Ng and colleagues demonstrated the role of serum SARS-CoV viral load measurement as a prognostic marker, even on the first day of hospital admission. A high systemic viral load may directly lead to severe tissue damage, or indirectly through the activation of a potentially damaging immune reaction.10 For SARS-CoV diagnosis, plasma or serum RT-PCR can be performed with high sensitivity during the first week of the disease. Stool and respiratory samples can be used during the second week, and serologic testing for antibodies against SARS-CoV can be used from day 21 onward.11 A major advantage of real-time PCR is that amplification and analysis are completed in a closed system. The risk of contamination, which can confound conventional (nested) RT-PCR protocols, is markedly reduced. This paper presents a very sensitive and specific quantitative RT-PCR assay, which can contribute to a rapid and efficient diagnosis of SARS in case of a new outbreak.",

Each of these dilutions was assayed four times per run. The mean values of CT, the standard deviations and the coefficients of variation were determined. Table 1\nshows that the SARS-CoV cRNA standards can be detected with a coefficient of variation of less than 0.7%.
