A. haemolyticum has an incidence ranging from 0.2% to 0.5%, with the highest frequency of infection in adolescents and young adults.16, 17\nCorynebacterium diphtheriae is also a cause of pharyngitis and is of particular concern for travelers to areas where vaccination programs are not well established or have failed.18 Nontoxigenic strains of C. diphtheria have been reported with increasing frequency in individuals with sore throat, but their contribution as a causative agent of pharyngitis remains in question.19 Pharyngitis caused by gonorrhea should be considered in sexually active adolescents and young adults. Throat cultures yield Neisseria gonorrhoeae in as many as 1% to 6% of individuals in sexually transmitted disease clinics.20, 21\nMycoplasma pneumoniae, identified in 3% to 14% of cases of pharyngitis, and Chlamydia pneumoniae, less frequently detected at 3% to 8%, should also be considered as potential etiologic agents of pharyngitis.4, 5, 22\n",

Multiple virulence factors have been identified that ultimately lead to the manifestation of acute pharyngitis. Despite this growing fund of knowledge, major gaps exist regarding the events leading to tonsillopharyngeal disease. Furthermore, the mechanism underlying asymptomatic carriage has been the subject of much speculation. The role the immune system and possible molecular genetic changes in GAS play in asymptomatic carriage remains elusive. Proteins involved in immune avoidance (M protein, hyaluronic acid capsule, C5a peptidase), adherence to epithelial cells (pilus, fibronectin binding proteins, lipoteichoic acid), spread through host tissues (hyaluronidase, streptokinase, deoxyribonucleases [DNases]), and numerous exotoxins (streptolysins, superantigenic toxins) have been described40, 41 but are beyond the scope of this chapter. Expression of these virulence factors leads to symptomatic pharyngitis and complications such as invasive disease, acute rheumatic fever, and acute glomerulonephritis. The mechanism by which GAS pharyngitis results in acute rheumatic fever is unknown. However, autoimmunity through molecular mimicry is suspected. A growing body of evidence supports the existence of rheumatogenic GAS serotypes. Comparing M-type distribution between two periods separated by 40 years, Shulman and co-workers42 were able to demonstrate that decreases or complete disappearance of certain M types were associated with the decline in incidence of acute rheumatic fever. Whether other strain-specific GAS virulence factors are involved is unknown.",

The only risk factor for symptomatic disease identified after the outbreak was cigarette smoking.56 Esposito and colleagues5 have described several case series of children with pharyngitis caused by M. pneumoniae or C. pneumoniae and identified dysphagia in 25% to 36%, tonsillar hypertrophy in 76% to 83%, cervical adenopathy in approximately half, and exudate in 25% to 39%. Although these findings were not specific to pharyngitis caused by atypical bacterial infection compared with common viral causes of pharyngitis, children with infection caused by M. pneumoniae or C. pneumoniae were significantly more likely to have a history of recurrent pharyngitis.57 In addition, children with pharyngitis caused by atypical bacterial infections treated with azithromycin had lower rates of subsequent respiratory infections, including lower tract disease, compared with children given symptomatic treatment alone.58\n",

In fact, Schacker and co-workers62 noted that only one quarter of patients with symptoms of primary HIV-1 infection had the diagnosis suspected at the initial medical evaluation. A recent report estimating the prevalence of primary HIV-1 infection in symptomatic adolescent and adult ambulatory patients found that pharyngitis was due to primary HIV-1 infection in 1.3 patients per 1000 cases.66 Because up to one half of all new HIV-1 infections occur in adolescents, physicians who care for adults and children should be familiar with the clinical characteristics of primary HIV-1 infection to maintain a high index of suspicion for this disorder.65 Early diagnosis via virus-specific tests, such as p24 antigen or the detection of plasma HIV-1 RNA, reliably identify people with primary HIV-1 infection before seroconversion and can potentially aid in both the control of virus transmission as well as treatment decisions for individual patients (see Chapter 122).",

The clinical manifestations include hyperemia of the pharynx, with discrete 1- to 4-mm erythematous-based vesicles or ulcerations sparsely distributed on the tonsillar pillars, uvula, soft palate, or posterior pharynx.71 Sore throat and fever are invariably present, but symptoms typically resolve spontaneously in about a week. Similar to herpangina, HFM is characterized by the presence of erythematous-based vesicles and ulcerations in the pharynx in a patient with significant sore throat. In contrast to herpangina, vesicles are also noted on the hands, feet, and buttocks in patients with HFM, and the fever tends to be less prominent.71 Although most cases are self-limited, severe multisystem disease, particularly involving the central nervous system, accompanying HFM and herpangina has been described during outbreaks associated with enterovirus 71 (see Chapter 174).72, 73\n",

            "text": "Assaying for the presence of GAS by throat culture on sheep blood agar plate (BAP), as first described by Breese and Disney,91 has been accepted practice for diagnosing streptococcal pharyngitis for more than 50 years. Selective streptococcal media are used by some laboratories and reduce the number of contaminating normal flora and may increase the sensitivity and specificity of culture.92 However, the use of selective media may also reduce the likelihood of recovery of other bacterial etiologic agents. Ideally, specimens should be obtained from bilateral tonsillar surfaces and the posterior pharynx while avoiding the mouth, tongue, and other surfaces of the pharynx. The major disadvantage of throat culture for the confirmation of GAS pharyngitis is the 24 to 48 hours required for accurate detection. RADT has become more readily available and, in some instances, has been reported to equal or exceed the sensitivity and specificity of throat culture. Rapid testing may lead to more timely treatment and, in so doing, can reduce the spread of GAS, time missed from school or work, overtreatment of viral causes of pharyngitis, and minimize suppurative and nonsuppurative sequelae of GAS. The original RADTs were based on the detection of GAS cell wall carbohydrate antigen by enzyme immunoassays. Newer assays use molecular biology methods to detect DNA specific to GAS by using chemiluminescence or real-time PCR but are restricted because of the need to batch specimens and the specialized equipment required. The sensitivity of RADTs is 70% to 90% when compared with BAP culture, with a specificity of approximately 95% and with all of the tests performing essentially the same.93 Of importance, RADT specimens must be collected in a manner similar to BAP culture. Swabs obtained from the mouth and subjected to RADT have a sensitivity of less than 20% versus 80% for those obtained properly from the posterior pharynx and tonsils.94 Currently, it is recommended that a negative RADT be confirmed by BAP culture for all children.86, 87 Because the incidence of a first attack of rheumatic fever is low in adults in the United States and the prevalence of GAS pharyngitis is minimal, the need to back up a negative RADT in adults is not universally recommended.84\n",

The diagnosis of Fusobacterium pharyngitis can be made by isolating the organism in anaerobic culture media, although most clinical laboratories rely on commercial kits and automated systems for identification. The accuracy of these systems is variable and may lead to initial misidentification. Molecular detection of Fusobacterium has been used in some studies96 but currently is not commercially available. The diagnosis of pharyngitis caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae is confirmed by isolation of the organism from a throat swab on selective media. Nucleic acid amplification tests are both sensitive and specific for urogenital specimens. Ease of testing pharyngeal samples may be simplified by nucleic acid amplification of salivary samples, but this is still in an investigational stage.97\n",
