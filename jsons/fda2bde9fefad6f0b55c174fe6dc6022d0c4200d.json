Computational simulations have played an important role to predict the development of the current pandemic. Such simulations enable early indications on the future projections of the pandemic and is useful to estimate the efficiency of control action in the battle against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The SEIR model is a well-known method used in computational simulations of infectious viral diseases and it has been widely used to model other epidemics such as Ebola, SARS, MERS, and influenza A. This paper presents a modified SEIRS model with additional exit conditions in the form of death rates and resusceptibiliy, where we can tune the exit conditions in the model to extend prediction on the current projections of the pandemic into three possible outcomes; death, recovery, and recovery with a possibility of resusceptibility. The model also considers specific information such as ageing factor of the population, time delay on the development of the pandemic due to control action measures, as well as resusceptiblity with temporary immune response. Owing to huge variations in clinical symptoms exhibited by COVID-19, the proposed model",

Based on clinical data reported from Wuhan where the outbreak began, elderly patients have been identified to have higher odds to experience severe symptoms with higher mortality rate compared to people of younger age [2] . Study also shows that up to approximately 80% of the people infected with SARS-CoV-2 are asymptomatic carriers, i.e. they experience no or mild symptoms but are still able to transport the virus to others [3] . This has caused the detection and containment of the SARS-CoV-2 virus to be much more challenging. As a result, social distancing has been widely implemented in many countries worldwide to slow down the transportation of the virus through minimised human-to-human contact. Individuals who have recovered from COVID-19 after experiencing mild or moderate symptoms are more likely to develop temporary resistant towards the virus and are unlikely to experience severe respiratory illnesses [4] . However, in rare occasions, there have been clinical findings showing that patients who have recovered from the disease have been reinfected. For instance, in February 2020, a patient in Osaka, Japan, has been tested positive towards the SARS-CoV-2 a few days after being discharged from the hospital for treatment with the disease [5] . Due to very limited knowledge on the immune response of humans to this novel virus, the possibility of reinfection cannot be ruled out at the moment.",

The SEIR model represents a typical infectious epidemic disease using four distinctive phases; susceptible (S) represents the population that has yet to be infected by the virus; exposed (E) represents the number of individuals exposed to the virus; infected (I) models the number of people infected, have demonstrated symptoms, and are able to spread the virus to the people in the S compartment; and lastly, recovered/removed (R) models the number of people who have recovered and are assumed to have immune response towards the virus [10, 11, 12] . Thus, based on the model, the S compartment will slowly deplete as the outbreak prolongs further, and the virus will eventually die out due to insufficient population within the S compartment. This compartmental modelling method allows transport of population from one compartment to another, where the disease transmission rates with respect to time can be simulated.",

In this model, the probability of a recovered patient to be reinfected with SARS-CoV-2 is taken into consideration to predict the future projection of COVID-19 cases. Resusceptibility is one of the crucial keys that could possibility lead to a prolonged COVID-19 pandemic. The consideration of resusceptibility is an important highlight in this paper as it has rarely been considered in the SEIR models reported thus far [14, 12, 15] . Other than that, we also included information such as demographic details for the ageing population, who seem to experience a higher rate of fatality due to COVID-19 [16] . Time delay in the control action representing the time taken for the authorities to act on the virus and also the duration of short-term immunity after recovery, which may lead to resusceptibility, are also considered in the model. The time delay factor is applied to enhance the robustness and accuracy of the model and simulation, hence to better reflect on the timely situation with specific measures to control the transmission of the disease. This paper is organised as follows: Section 2 presents the development of the mathematical model; Section 3 presents the design of the simulation package using the Matlab/Simulink environment; Section 4 provides the results and discussions on the model using case studies with real-world data; and Section 5 concludes the paper.",

The other reason is that South Korea is also one of the very few countries that managed to effectively flatten the COVID-19 infection curve and it has set itself apart from others in leading the fight against COVID-19, at least for the moment. For example, the country started vigorous testing among its population with contact tracing, especially those of confirmed and suspected cases during the early stage of the epidemic. The government accomplished this by maintaining a public database keeping track of mobile phones, credit cards, and other data of patients who tested positive [18] .

First, we assumed that the population of South Korea to be approximately N = 515\u00d710 6 with an elderly population of about 15% (N old = 015) [19] . We then set the percentage of recovery to be 98% (\u03ba = 098) for the general public [1] and a fatality rate of 8% ((1 \u2212 \u03ba old ) = 008) for the elderly [20] . We then assumed the incubation time and recovery time to be \u03c4 inc = 51, and \u03c4 rec = 188, respectively in accordance with [21] . The basic reproduction number was set to R 0 = 52 (95% CI: 504-536) based on the early growthrate of the epidemic in South Korea. The initial infected and exposed cases were assumed to be I(0) = 4 and E(0) = 20I(0), respectively. See Table  1 . Figure 3a shows the results of the initial fitting of the model based on the data in South Korea while Figure 3b shows the projections of the model when no control action is taken. There are some minor discrepancies between the modelled values and the real-world data during the initial stage of the simulation as seen in Figure 3a . This is absolutely reasonable and acceptable while modelling an actual epidemic as most countries are still coming to terms with the virus during the first month and the data do not usually represent the actual number of cases due to lack of testing for confirmed cases.",

As a result, the reproduction number could be reduced to R t \u2248 125. We also assumed that there was a time delay of 30 days since the first confirmed case before the control action was introduced (\u03c4 pre\u2212\u03c3 = 30) and a further delay of approximately 13 days before the control action could be properly executed in the community (\u03c4 post\u2212\u03c3 = 13). Figure 4 shows the simulation results. Figure 4a shows that the trajectory of the modelled infected and death cases match the real-world data after the control action was introduced. Figure 4b shows the simulation results until the model stabilises assuming no subsequent control action being taken to further reduce the reproduction number. Comparing Figure 4b with Figure 3b , the peak of the number of infected cases could be reduced from about 19 million cases to about 700,000 cases. ",

The first confirmed case was recorded on 27th February 2020, and as of 7th April 2020, the total number of confirmed cases stood at 1,255 with 73 fatalities. We used the parameters in Table 2 for the initial fitting of the model based on the data from PHA on the initial growth-rate of the epidemic in Northern Ireland. Figure 6a shows the results of the initial fitting, with Figure 6b depicting the projections of the infected and deaths if no control action is taken. We then simulated the model based on the control action carried out; most schools in Northern Ireland were closed beginning 18th March 2020 followed by a national lockdown initiated by the United Kingdom government on the 23rd March 2020. As such, we set \u03c4 pre\u2212\u03c3 = 20 (20 days) to correspond to said dates since the first confirmed case, and assuming that it took a further approximately 12 days for the public to respond to these control action, i.e. \u03c4 post\u2212\u03c3 = 12, we obtained the simulation results as shown in Figure 7 . The results show that in order for the model to follow the projected trajectories of the data from PHA in Figure 7a , the control action have to achieve an efficiency of about 45% (\u03c3 = 045), which indicates that the reproduction number could be reduced to R t \u2248 275. Comparing Figure  6b with Figure 7b , the peak of the number of infected cases could be reduced from 650,000 cases to 350,000 cases. ",

This second control action also reflects on the announcement made by the United Kingdom government in early April 2020 to allow police officers to enforce social distancing measures. Assuming that this second control action results in a further efficiency of 65%, the reproduction number could then be reduced to R t \u2248 096. Assuming that it would take another 7 days for the public to fully respond to the control action, we could observe the results as shown in Figure 8 . With the initiation of the second control action, it can be seen in Figure 8a that the peak in the infection curve is now reduced to 2,500 cases. As such, the critical care capacity should be able to meet the demand for treatment based on the same assumption made earlier in this section, where it is estimated about 10% of the infected cases are admitted to the ICU. Another observation worth noting is that the number of deaths in the worst case scenario has also been reduced to about 2,750 cases. See Figure 8b . This value echos the projection made by the government in Northern Ireland that the COVID-19 would lead to 3,000 deaths during the first wave [30] .",
