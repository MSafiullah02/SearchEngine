Currently, there is no specific therapy available to treat CHIKV infection. In the present study, the in vitro prophylactic and therapeutic effects of chloroquine on CHIKV replication in Vero cells were investigated. Inhibitory effects were observed when chloroquine was administered pre-infection, post-infection, and concurrent with infection, suggesting that chloroquine has prophylactic and therapeutic potential. The inhibitory effects were confirmed by performing a plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT), real-time reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR analysis of viral RNA levels, and cell viability assays. Chloroquine diminished CHIKV infection in a dose-dependent manner, with an effective concentration range of 5-20 mM. Concurrent addition of drug with virus, or treatment of cells prior to infection drastically reduced virus infectivity and viral genome copy number by !99.99%. The maximum inhibitory effect of chloroquine was observed within 1-3 hr post-infection (hpi), and treatment was ineffective once the virus successfully passed through the early stages of infection. The mechanism of inhibition of virus activity by chloroquine involved impaired endosomalmediated virus entry during early stages of virus replication, most likely through the prevention of endocytosis and/or endosomal acidification, based on a comparative evaluation using ammonium chloride, a known lysosomotropic agent.",

Since 2005, CHIKV infection has assumed epidemic proportions in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. Several outbreaks of CHIKV fever occurred in 2006, and virus was disseminated among the populations of several islands in the Indian Ocean (the Comoros, Mauritius, Seychelles, Madagascar, La Reunion) prior to outbreaks in India, where an estimated 1.4 million cases have been reported [Charell et al., 2007; Mavalankar et al., 2007; Pialoux et al., 2007] . Recent cases of CHIKV infection in Europe and Italy have occurred as a result of travel to and from infected areas [Rezza et al., 2007] . CHIKV is an arthropod-borne virus of the Alphavirus genus of the Togaviridae family. It is transmitted primarily to humans by Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. Like other Alphaviruses, the genome of CHIKV consists of a linear, positive-stranded RNA molecule of $11.8 kb [Jupp and McIntosh, 1998 ]. CHIKV causes an acute illness characterized by fever, headache, skin rash, vomiting, myalgia, and polyarthralgia [Jupp and McIntosh, 1998 ].",

In the absence of an effective vaccine and mosquito control measures, it is necessary to seek effective anti-viral drugs for immediate relief for affected patients and to reduce viremia. The therapeutic application of small interfering RNA (si-RNA) for the inhibition of CHIKV replication has achieved limited success . Chloroquine is an effective anti-malarial drug in areas where resistance has not been established. Increasingly, chloroquine is being applied to the clinical management of viral diseases [Savarino et al., 2003 [Savarino et al., , 2006 . Chloroquine as an effective anti-viral therapeutic for the clinical management of viral diseases was first established in the 1990s for HIV-1 infection [Savarino, 2005] . Anti-viral effects of chloroquine against SARS-CoV, HIV type 1 and hepatitis B virus have also been reported [Kouroumalis and Koskinas, 1986; Tsai et al., 1990; Vincent et al., 2005] , and the use of chloroquine as a therapeutic for HIV-1 infection is currently being evaluated in clinical trials [Savarino et al., 2006] . In light of its availability and cost, and the fact that it is well tolerated, chloroquine offers promise as an anti-viral and immunomodulatory agent for the treatment of emerging viral diseases [Keyaerts et al., 2004] . Increased virulence of CHIKV as a result of evolutionary adaptation during Chikungunya outbreaks has been reported [Schuffenecker et al., 2006; Santhosh et al., 2008] . Thus, it has become increasingly important to develop effective therapeutic approaches for the treatment of CHIKV infection. The goal of the current study was to evaluate the doseand time-dependent effects of chloroquine on CHIKV replication, and to elucidate the mechanism of viral inhibition in Vero cells.",

There was also a significant reduction in viral RNA copy number, based on real-time RT-PCR analysis (Fig. 2) , providing strong evidence of the therapeutic potential of chloroquine in inhibiting CHIKV replication. In cell viability assays, chloroquine treatment provided near complete protection of Vero cells against CHIKV infection, which provided further evidence of the anti-viral potential of this drug.

A similar mechanism may be responsible for the inhibition of CHIKV infection by chloroquine. In the case of Alphaviruses like Sindbis virus (SINV) and Semilink Forest virus (SFV), conformational changes in the viral envelope glycoprotein and subsequent viral fusion are mediated by clathrinmediated endocytosis by the target cell and the low pH of the endosomal compartment [DeTulleo and Kirchhausen, 1998 ]. It has been reported that a low endosomal pH is also required for CHIKV entry into cells [Sourisseau et al., 2007] . In the case of concurrent treatment and post-treatment (1 hpi), rapid elevation of endosomal pH and abrogation of virus-endosome fusion might be the primary mechanism by which virus infectivity is inhibited by chloroquine. The kinetics of inhibition based on a time course analysis clearly imply that the anti-viral effects of chloroquine decline substantially when the drug is added later than 3 hpi (Fig. 4) . In the post-treatment group, the addition of chloroquine at an early stage (1-3 hpi) of infection had a marked effect on virus yield, whereas late stage addition (4-6 hpi) was ineffective. The IC 50 of chloroquine for inhibiting CHIKV in vitro is similar to the plasma concentration of chloroquine reached during the treatment of acute malaria [Charmot and Coulaud, 1990] . Thus, chloroquine might inhibit CHIKV infection and its subsequent dissemination.",

Infected Vero cells treated with chloroquine exhibited markedly lower levels of fluorescence intensity as compared to infected cells, and this effect was dose dependent with complete inhibition at higher concentrations of chloroquine (Fig. 3) . The results of IFT also supported the finding that pre-treatment of cells with 10 or 20 mM chloroquine was more effective than concurrent treatment and posttreatment (1 hpi), which were effective to a lesser extent at higher concentrations of chloroquine. These results suggest that chloroquine treatment prevents or delays virus internalization. In order to gain an understanding of the mechanism of action of chloroquine, we compared the effects of chloroquine to those of the well-known anti-viral compounds ribavirin and ammonium chloride. Ribavirin is an anti-viral compound that inhibits a number of viruses, including CHIKV, and acts at late stages of viral infection [Gilbert and Knight, 1986] . Ammonium chloride is a lysomotropic agent that blocks early stages of infection, for example, endosome-mediated virus entry, and has no effect during later stages of infection [Cassell et al., 1984] . Ammonium chloride was effective against CHIKV when cells were pre-treated (24 hr before), and retained its anti-viral activity even when it was removed prior to infection. However, administration of ammonium chloride 6 hpi did not protect cells from CHIKV infection (Fig. 5a) . In contrast, ribavirin was effective against CHIKV infection only when administered after infection. No inhibitory effect was observed when cells were pre-treated with ribavirin followed by removal of the drug before infection (Fig. 5b) . Thus, chloroquine (Fig. 5c) and ammonium chloride exhibited similar patterns of inhibition of CHIKV propagation, suggesting that chloroquine might also target the early stages of CHIKV infection.",
