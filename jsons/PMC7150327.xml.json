The taxa include the largest mammals on earth, baleen whales, as well as marine and freshwater toothed whales, dolphins, and porpoises (the odontocetes). The taxonomy of the cetacean infraorder is presented in the Supplemental Materials in Table e1, Table e2. There are approximately 89 living species of cetaceans. Of these, 15 species comprise the baleen whales and there are more than 70 species of toothed whales. Odontocetes include species with diverse ecological (including foraging strategies, prey selection and habitat use), anatomical and physiological differences ranging from the freshwater river dolphins to deep diving beaked whales. This subgroup includes sperm whales, porpoises, dolphins, beluga, narwhal, and beaked whales. These adaptations can have important implications when evaluating gross pathology and histopathologic findings. Free-ranging whales and dolphins may have global distributions but many ecotypes have localized habitats with or without a specific migratory range. A limited number of odontocetes, primarily delphinids, are maintained in captivity. For this reason, the published material of cetacean pathology is heavily biased towards odontocetes using material from captive and stranded animals.",

This condition is more thoroughly presented in Chapter 4. This altered clotting system does not lead to pathologic bleeding tendencies but can impede collection of serum as part of routine clinical chemistry evaluations. To manage this, routine clinical blood draws typically involve three different blood collection tubes containing anticoagulant: one orange-topped (thrombin), one light blue-topped (sodium citrate), and one purple topped (potassium EDTA) tube (Fig. 22.1\n). This assortment of tubes facilitates clinical chemistry with minimal hemolysis, electrolytes and acid-base determinations, hematology, clotting profiles, whole blood sedimentation times, and plasma fibrinogen determination. For genomic assays, a green-topped (lithium heparin) tube should be added to the collection set.",

            "text": "The anatomy of cetacea varies from domestic mammal species in many ways. The most obvious difference is musculoskeletal, with the lack of hind limbs and evolutionary transformation of the forelimb to a flipper appendage. With the loss of hindlimbs there is an associated reduction of the pelvis. Vestigial hip bones with occasional articulations (pseudoarthroses) remain and can be located deep in the muscle of the ventrolateral caudal abdominal wall. The presence of these bones has been linked to male sexual performance (Dines et al., 2014). The altered gravitational effects of a fluid environment, hydrodynamic configurations, and buoyancy enhanced by a thick blubber layer and lung capacity, have resulted in lower bone densities than would be expected if cetacean bones had the gravitational forces of terrestrial mammalian counterparts. As long bones of the forelimbs have no medullary cavity, bone marrow is best extracted from vertebral bodies or ribs. The torso is enveloped by a thick axial fibroelastic sheath which stores kinetic energy with each fluke stroke to enhance swimming efficiency.\n",

The skull elongation is asymmetrical with the bony margins of the blow hole off center. Above the elongated maxilla, is the melon, a structure designed for forward propagation of echolocation clicks. Returning sound or echolocation vibrations enter the head via the soft tissues and are specifically focused towards the mandibular fat body within the caudal, \u201cpan\u201d section of the mandibles. Cetaceans have no external ears and have a rudimentary ear canal that does not connect to the tympanoperiotic capsule containing the bones of the middle and inner ears. In contrast to the axial and appendicular skeleton, these bones are remarkably dense and have ligamentous attachments to the adjoining skull with expanded accessory tympanoperiotic air sinuses, homologous to guttural pouches in horses. At necropsy, ear wax may be collected from eustachian tubes from some large cetaceans, and hormonal and chemical analyses provide valuable insights into temporal reproductive and stress hormone levels, as well as contaminant exposure through the life of the animal.",

            "text": "The gastrointestinal morphology of cetaceans varies by genera/species. Instead of teeth, oral cavities of the baleen (mysticete) whales contain multiple plates of keratin with a fibrous fringe extending from the upper jaw to the lower gums. To resist forces of water engulfment and prey extraction associated with filter feeding, the plates are secured by zwischensubstanz to the gingiva. The number and length of plates vary throughout the baleen suborder. On cross section, they present thick cortical plates encasing 3\u20135 layers of horny tubules (Slijper, 1979). Isotopic analysis of baleen provides valuable insights into life history endocrine levels and prey selection (Hunt et al., 2014) and foreshortening, abrasion, fraying, and erosion of plates have been attributed to mechanical forces associated with lunge or ram feeding and tongue movements. At necropsy, thorough examination of the oral cavity for foreign debris is imperative. The teeth of the odontocetes vary by family and prey-type. Tooth shape of the delphinids is either conical or spade-shaped; each tooth has only one root. There are no incisors or molars\u2014all teeth are more or less identical (homodont). The squid-eating sperm whale has one row of conical teeth on both sides of the lower jaw but none in the upper jaw. The Kogiadae\u2014pygmy and dwarf sperm whales similarly only have lower teeth. The beaked whales have no more than one or two erupted teeth in the lower jaw. In one species of beaked whale, the strap-toothed whale, the lower teeth erupt and extend to encircle the maxilla so that the jaw can only open a few centimeters. A unique dental modification of the odontocetes is found in the narwhal. Narwhal gums typically have only a single erupted tooth. The male\u2019s tusk is a giant canine tooth with a distinct left-handed spiral. It can grow as long as three meters and is covered in cementum rather than enamel. Rarely, both canines can erupt and form tusks. The canines of females can erupt and produce a shortened tusk. The porosity of the tusk suggests that the structure acts as a sensory device for measuring water salinity, temperature and pressure (Nweeia et al., 2014), as well as for social interactions (dominance) and hunting (striking) of prey species.",

The main fundic stomach is a smaller, generally round structure with a deep red-brown folded, glandular mucosa. Gastric glands containing neck cells, parietal cells, and chief cells line the surface of this chamber. The third, pyloric chamber of the stomach is \u201cU-shaped\u201d with a prominent sphincter that regulates the passage of ingesta into the small intestine. There is a sacular dilation of the proximal duodenum to form an ampulae. The size, length, and number of saculations in the connecting chamber vary considerably between species. The saculations are created by a series of valves without distinct sphincters. Histologically, the mucosa of the connecting chambers and pylorus is the same and features deep branching tubular pits producing primarily mucus along with gastrin and lysozyme. In contrast, the duodenal ampula is identified histologically by the regular components of the duodenal wall\u2014villous mucosa, submucosa, tunica muscularis, and serosa. All cetaceans lack a gall bladder. Likewise, the cecum is notably absent in the odontocetes with the exception of river dolphins, making gross distinction between small and large intestine difficult. The rectum of odontocetes has lymphoid nodules within the mucosa and submucosa termed the \u201ccolonic tonsil.\u201d Dwarf and pygmy sperm whales (Kogia spp.) have a sacular dilation of the distal colon colloquially called the \u201cink sac\u201d (Fig. 22.2\n). This structure can hold up to 12 L of dark, fluid, fecal material. When forcibly expelled, this liquid creates a dense cloud to distract predators, allowing the whale to swim away. In sperm whales a unique compound, ambergris is produced by consumption and partial digestion of squid beaks.",

            "text": "The respiratory tract of cetaceans has a variety of modifications that must be understood to interpret gross and histologic observations and to comprehend the special vulnerability of cetaceans to lung disease. The blow hole is analogous to the nostrils and is located on the dorsal aspect of the head. There are two external openings in mysticetes and a single blowhole in odontocetes. The blowhole is closed as the associated muscles are relaxed. In either group, the underlying skull has a nasal septum so all cetceans have dual entry into the upper respiratory tract. There are no turbinates to filter inhaled particles in any cetaceans. With large tidal volumes and respiratory exchange rates of less than 1\u20132 s, deposition of particles and pathogens deep into the respiratory tract is easier than with terrestrial mammals. Because of this, respiratory disease is a much more significant cause of morbidity and mortality in cetaceans (St Leger et al., 2009). A nasal air sac system with analogous anatomy and function to the paranasal sinuses in terrestrial mammals extends from the cranial respiratory tract rostral to the integration of the larynx. These sacs are not enclosed in bone like sinuses (Reidenberg and Laitman, 2008). An elongated larynx called a \u201cgoosebeak\u201d extends through the esophagus to the bony nasal passage and is held in place by the muscular palatopharyngeal sphincter (Reynolds and Rommell, 1999). While the sphincter and larynx form a tight seal, the larynx can still be displaced through esophageal pressure associated with swallowing large objects or voluntarily by the animal contracting the hyoepiglottic and associated laryngeal muscles. This behavior has been associated with cases of fatal aspiration and asphyxiation. At the base of the larynx, are numerous trabeculae that entrap foreign particulate material and overlie microscopic lymphoglandular elements; the latter are, homologous to human adenoids. The trachea has a large vascular venous plexus with prominent lacunae in the subepithelium. This structure has a critical role in fungal tracheitis (presented under fungal infections).",

First, cartilage extends from the trachea all the way to the level of distal bronchioles and on gross examination, are visible as cartilage \u201cnodules\u201d throughout the parenchyma. Within the bronchioles, smooth muscle and elastic sphincters create a series of compartments along the airway to the level of the alveoli (Fig. 22.3). These changes are a diving adaptation. However, the valves can obstruct pulmonary clearance of parasites and secondary bacterial involvement can result in bronchiectasis and multifocal pulmonary abscesses. Additionally, granular to tophic, basophilic calcific deposits can be present in the epithelium and subepithelial tissues of the bronchioles. These deposits likely reflect prior areas of bronchiolar damage or inspissated material. Lastly, the alveolar walls of the cetacean lung contain both type I and type II pneumocytes, but type III (brush border cells) are absent. The alveolar walls contain double (as opposed to single in terrestrial mammals) rows of capillaries (Fig. 22.3\n). A common age-related change is an increase in fibrous tissue expanding the alveolar interstitium and pleura. This change likely reflects an element of a chronic immune response. Areas with severe chronic pulmonary fibrosis likely reflect resolution of prior inflammation.",

Not only are there a number of countercurrent vascular exchange units, but the rete mirabile is the primary source of blood to the brain. The internal carotid arteries are vestigial and supply blood to the eyes and ears and provide little to no oxygenated blood to the brain. Instead, the brachiocephalic trunk and descending aorta branch off to feed the intercostal and dorsal thoracic arteries. These vessels supply blood to the thoracic (Fig. 22.4\n) and spinal rete mirabile. Retes are structures in which the arteries branch into a number of small vessels that finally reconstitute into a single vessel. The smaller arterioles may be intertwined or bathed in a sinus of cooler venous blood. The blood supply to the head of the dolphin derives from the spinal meningeal arteries and enters the cranium at the occipital foramen. The unique vascular modifications of cetaceans are many and may predispose these animals to spontaneous intravascular gas bubble formation and embolization (Caisson\u2019s disease).

The gray whale barnacle, Cryptolepas rhachianecti, attaches to calves and mothers. Once the crustacean has settled, it spends its entire life cycle attached to the whale. Barnacle clusters, similar to callosities can be used to identify individual whales. Also as with the callosities, species specific cyamids lodge within these proliferative areas to feed on whale skin. These parasites spread from dams to their calves during birth, nursing, and general contact. Microscopically, affected skin is markedly hyperplastic with hyperkeratosis, pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia, and spongiosus with superficial bacterial colonization and varying degrees of inflammation in the superficial dermis.",

Exposure may be through direct contact with the skin, eyes, oral cavity, blowhole, or through ingestion and prey contamination so an awareness of pre-existing stressors in the habitat is essential. The lack of baseline data on ecosystem components, animal health, demographics, and population trends within an oiled area may significantly impede interpretation of pathology and ancillary diagnostic findings and confound delineation of long term lethal and sublethal effects of spills. Although oil exposure laboratory studies were conducted in the 1980s there are few investigations to assess the pathogenesis of exposure. Moreover, as petroleum products may include a number of inorganic and organic compounds, it is difficult to extrapolate the effects of one spill to another. As a result, the pathogenesis of oil exposure is often delineated from review of findings with oiling spill events.

Changes include multifocal myocardial degeneration and fibrosis, endocardiosis, valvular fibrosis, papillary fibro-elastomas, mitral leaflet thickening, and left ventricular hypertrophy. Atherosclerosis is uncommon but has been seen in both captive and free ranging bottlenose dolphins. Degenerative arthritis, spondylitis, and spondylosis occur and are sometimes linked to inanition perhaps secondary to reduced mobility. However, they can also occur unrelated to the proximate cause of death. A holistic evaluation of cases helps to keep pathologic findings in perspective. Tooth wear, fracture, laxity, and attrition are associated with advanced age in many odontocetes (Fig. 22.13A, B). The limited or lack of enamel covering odontocete teeth increases their vulnerability to wear and damage. Wear intensity varies by species and diet, with killer whales and pseudorcas having the highest prevalence (Loch and Sim\u00f5es-Lopes, 2012). As patterns of dental wear in the killer whale can reflect dietary specializations (elasmobranchs versus salmonids or other marine mammal prey species) and learned behaviors, tooth wear is not always the best indicator of age in some odontocete species.",

The zona fasciculata and glomerulosa are primarily expanded but all three cortical zones can be involved. Medullary expansion may be difficult to distinguish from pheochromocytomas except that cells demonstrate no atypia or increased mitoses. Chlorinated hydrocarbons as a cause for this lesion have been investigated; to date a link has not been found (Kuiken et al., 1993). In general, adrenal hyperplasia and cyst formation are not associated with systemic pathology. They may represent compensatory physiology adaptations and typically appear incidental with few sequelae.

Moreover, post mortem change (autolysis), scavenging and mutilation can impede recognition and interpretation of gross and microscopic findings in examined animals. However, advanced imaging studies, chemical analysis of gas emboli, and an increasing knowledge about sharp and blunt force injuries, have all contributed significantly to our improved detection and confirmation of anthropogenic insults. It is important to note that these categories are not mutually exclusive and detection and interaction of more than one entity may occur. Conversely, a single insult may result in multiple pathologic manifestations.

As with \u201cthe bends\u201d in humans, change in the dive profile is a prime contributor to gas bubble formation and can result in subsequent embolization, impaired vascular perfusion, ischemia, and infarction. The most common anthropogenic activities associated with this process include deployment of mid-range tactical naval sonar and net entanglement due to fisheries interaction resulting in abrupt ascent from depth to the surface. With acute presentations, gas bubbles may be seen in the mesenteric (Fig. 22.16A), renal, pulmonary, hepatic, coronary, meningeal, and spinal epidural rete vasculature; subserosal and mesenteric vasculature should be closely scrutinized for intravascular gas. Associated hemorrhage is most commonly identified in visceral pleura, epicardium, and acoustic fat. Histopathology typically features occlusion and variable vascular distention by clear microcavitations with acute perivascular hemorrhage and occasional infarction (Fig. 22.16B). In the acute phase of decompression, fat emboli may also be seen in the pulmonary vasculature as well as the epidural rete, subcapsular sinuses of lymph nodes, and renal vasculature (Fern\u00e1ndez et al., 2005). Should animals survive the initial insult, lesions may resolve through vascular resorption and exhalation or offloading of gases. Progession to more chronic stages is characterized by fibrous encapsulation of pseudocysts with variable granulomatous infiltrates and Langhan\u2019s type multinucleated giant cells. These cavitations are most commonly recognized within the liver, kidney, spleen, and stomach wall. Dysbaric osteonecrosis has also been reported in larger cetaceans. In the past, gas production associated with putrefaction, and hemorrhage associated with substrate in live stranded animals may have confounded diagnoses of decompression disease; however, with computed tomography imaging studies and mass spectrophotometric analysis of gas samples, nitrogen may be differentiated from those gases attributed to decomposition artifact.",

Due to the unique physical properties of the aquatic environment and substrate, lesions in cetaceans are typically more profound in aquatic than in terrestrial mammals. With detonation of an explosive, there is rapid conversion of the liquid or solid to a gas under high pressure and temperature, which generates a blast front and immediate increase in underwater static pressure. This energy is transmitted and propagated radially as alternating positive and negative pressure waves. On impact with an animal, there are implosive and pressure differentials, which can generate up to a ninefold increase in pressure. In contrast to detonations on the ground or in the air, underwater explosions are more lethal due to the incompressibility of water, resulting in shock wave propagation up to three times farther than on land, as well as reflection of shock waves along the substrate and air surface interface resulting in more complex blast waves (Cox et al., 2006, Jepson et al., 2003).",

Pulmonary rents with pneumothorax or hemothorax may also occur and microscopically, bronchoalveolar spaces may have frank hemorrhage admixed with exfoliated type I pneumocytes and rafts of detached and aspirated ciliated respiratory epithelia. With shearing of blood vessels in the lung and blubber, intravascular gas and fat may be apparent and embolization may further compromise homeostasis.

Although small cetaceans and larger whales can be impacted, larger slower moving whales tend to be more frequently involved, particularly when congregated in shipping lanes. Depending on the point of contact with the vessel, animals may present with blunt force or sharp injury that may be directly lethal or contribute to sustained injuries, which may resolve or can persist for extended periods of time. Case definitions and examples of traumatic lesions are available (Moore et al., 2013). Although animals affected with blunt force injury may have no apparent external lesions, on reflection of the skin and blubber, subcutaneous hemorrhage and edema at the impact site is usually noted. If the fibroelastic sheath is intact, focally extensive bulging may be observed and on incision, massive hematoma formation with shearing and necrosis of the subjacent skeletal musculature may be evident. Rupture of the sheath at the time of impact is more typically associated with extensive subcutaneous hemorrhage, which may track dependently in the hypodermis. Inspection of the abdominal and thoracic cavities may also reveal organ herniation, transposition, rupture, and associated hemorrhage. Histologicaly, acute myocellular degeneration and necrosis with edema and hemorrhage at the impact site and in muscle samples remote to the site of impact are seen and flocculent, granular, discoid and hyalinized segmental myodegeneration are attributed to agonal catecholamine surge. Fat embolization may be apparent in the pulmonary and renal microvasculature. Depending on the circumstances, animal impacts with stationary structures, such as piers, moorings, wind farms or tidal hydroelectric turbines, may present with similar gross lesions to those of ship strike (Moore et al., 2013).",

However, an unusual form of kelp-gull predation of skin in living, free-swimming whales that was first noted in the 1980s has become a locally important problem. Adult whales have developed several strategies to avoid gulls, for example by keeping their backs under water; calves that have not developed this behavior remain highly vulnerable. The attacks can last for hours at a time and interfere with normal calf resting and nursing. The kelp gull population near Peninsula Vald\u00e9s has grown dramatically in recent decades, and the percentage of mothers and calves with gull lesions has correspondingly increased from an average of 2% in the 1970s to 99% in the 2000s.Gull harassment is considered a possible contributing factor in calf mortality (McAloose et al., 2016). Skin wounds can vary in size from small, focal lesions covering approximately 0.1% of the dorsal back surface to large, coalescing wounds over 8% of the dorsal body wall. The wound patterns vary from round to oval and often coalesce. Histologically, the injuries exhibit dermal congestion, suppurative dermatitis and panniculitis, necrotizing vasculitis and vascular thrombosis. Two calves with wounds forming discrete rhomboid shapes have been described. Bacterial culture and PCR confirmed Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae from lesions in these two calves (Fiorito et al., 2016). However, these were isolated cases and bacterial, viral or other infectious diseases that predispose the skin to predation have, to date, not been identified. Physiologic and metabolic factors associated with extensive skin loss and energetic costs associated with prolonged flight/avoidance activities are additional topics of active investigation.",

Derelict and active fisheries netting, commercial monofilament lines, crab-trap lines and rope impact cetaceans directly through entanglement or entrapment. External evidence of net entanglement may include gear impressions along the surface of the skin or oral mucosa (hatched or linear furrows), abrasions, incisions, lacerations, and subcutaneous hemorrhage (Fig. 22.18\n). However, surface evidence of entanglement may not always be apparent, particularly when animals are entrapped in a trawl with large numbers of fish that prevent direct contact with the netting. In these instances, animals may present in good nutritional condition with stable white tracheobronchial froth, hyperinflated lungs with generalized pulmonary edema, congestion and subpleural emphysema. Pleural and pulmonary petechiae and ecchymoses may also be noted. Diagnosis may be contingent on the circumstances of death.

There is a predilection for rope and net entanglement of the peduncle or tail stock, fins, flippers and oral cavity. Depending on the degree of constriction or compression and anatomic location, vascular perfusion may be impaired with hypoxia and ischemic necrosis of distal extremities. In severe cases, amputation of an appendage may occur either acutely with incision on impact or more chronic ischemia.

Based on long-term data analysis, it is suggested that persistent organic pollutants and harmful algal blooms (toxins) may be associated with an increased risk of entanglement. If feasible, samples to screen for these compounds should be harvested at necropsy. In some instances, the force of initial impact may be so severe, that fracture of the rostrum or mandible with tooth loss may be evident. An indirect consequence of fisheries interaction is depredation, a learned behavior recognized predominantly in killer whales, false killer whale, pilot whales, and sperm whales characterized by removal of fish from long line hooks. In rare instances, hooks have been ingested and penetrated the oropharynx, resulting in secondary septicemia. This behavior may also result in whale harassment and possibly gunshot, further contributing to the loss of these animals. Less common forms of entrapment may include interactions with aquaculture net-pen facilities, piers, and boat harbors (Read and Murray, 2000).

Foreign material may be observed along varying levels of the alimentary canal of marine mammals and can be associated with generalized emaciation. Pica and terminal ingestion of foreign debris is noted in live, moribund stranded dolphins and may reflect a behavioral effect; whereas, in ram or lunge feeding baleen whales, ingestion of floating or suspended debris may be inadvertent. Other cetaceans with more discriminate feeding habits appear to selectively ingest material that may accumulate to sufficient quantity to impair normal digestive processes. Postmortem findings include distention of the stomach by foreign debris (including netting up to 16 m2 in sperm whales, rope, plastic bags, fishing line, and other materials), which in more severely affected animals has resulted in obstruction, localized ulceration, perforation, and secondary peritonitis (Moore et al., 2013). In additional to the physical consequences of ingested debris, manufactured plastics also incorporate polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), persistent organic pollutants, and other additives, which over time, may be assimilated and have a direct immunotoxicologic consequence to animals. This process may be exacerbated with inadvertent ingestion of microplastics or may result from mechanical breakdown of larger plastic items in the marine environment to secondary microparticles (Simmonds, 2012).

At present, there are no pathognomonic lesions or biochemical markers for asphyxiation and diagnosis typically relies on circumstances associated with recovery of the carcass. In marine mammals a presumptive diagnosis of asphyxiation is most commonly associated with bycaught individuals where animals present or are recovered entrapped in gill nets or trawls (see by-catch section for additional details). An additional form of asphyxiation is more sporadic and related to ingestion of foreign debris, such as fishing line which may obstruct or displace the larynx. The same effect is achieved when cetaceans consume prey that is sufficiently large to cause displacement of the larynx and secondarily obstruct the exposed airway (Fig. 22.19\n). Cases in animals in managed care have been seen where regurgitated objects have subsequently lodged in the displaced larynx and resulted in fatal asphyxiation.

Skin sloughing also occurs as the result of postmortem decomposition and the two should be differentiated.

In cetaceans, keratinocytes are not a feature of the epidermis. Degeneration of the cells in the stratum spinosum includes individual cell contraction and dissociation (Martinez-Levasseur et al., 2011). In these instances, the burn damage is coupled with damage from drying/dehydration of the skin. This results in the degeneration, fragmentation, and lifting of the stratum externum and superficial layers of the stratum spinosum. In more severe cases, clefts extend below the stratum germinativum lifting the entire epidermis. The dermis contains hemorrhage, vascular dilation, and perivascular edema.

Malignant tumors were identified as the cause of death in 14% of the beluga examined with gastrointestinal adenocarcinoma the most common, affecting 7% of mature adults. Eight cases of mammary carcinoma were identified in 10% of examined adult females. These tumors were often metastatic and in 6 of the 8 cases, mammary gland carcinoma was identified as the cause of death in affected whales. There were 2 fatal cases of thyroid carcinoma, 1 of lymphoma, and 2 benign ovarian tumors (Lair et al., 2014). No comparable prevalence of neoplasia has been found in other free-ranging cetacean populations.

For this reason, these proliferative lesions are designated as orogenital papillomas with the caveat that only oral masses have been identified as transforming to either carcinoma in situ or squamous cell carcinoma at this time (Bossart et al., 2005). Oral papillomas present as raised, well-circumscribed, pale, irregular masses or plaques in the oral mucosa, mucocutaneous junction, or on the tongue. Histologically, they are composed of hyperplastic epithelium and tend to recur after excision. With time, these masses may progress to carcinoma in situ or a more aggressive squamous cell carcinoma. Grossly, malignancies present with irregular, poorly demarcated ulcerative areas admixed within neoplastic and proliferative tissue. Histologically, the presentation is classic for both concerns. The oral SCC cases bridge the mucosal basement membrane and irregular islands and fingers of proliferating cells expand from the central lesion both deeply and widely (Fig. 22.22A, B).",

Prescapular lymph node involvement is important clinically because this tissue is accessible for both ultrasound\nand biopsy to screen for metastatic spread. The aggressive nature of these neoplasms is reported to be enhanced during pregnancy, suggesting a role of both hormones and immune modification in the pathogenesis of these tumors. Exposure of the oral cavity to ultraviolet light associated with \u201cheads up\u201d feeding of captive dolphins above the water surface is suggested as having a potential role in malignant transformation of the mucosal epithelium (N.

Pinpoint lesions have a dark center, which may be depressed relative to adjacent skin), and may be surrounded by a pale margin forming a target lesion. Lesions can occur anywhere on the body but the flippers and flukes are generally less affected. They often wax and wane over many months and years. Studies in captive bottlenose dolphins demonstrate a marked reduction in lesion intensity to the point of clearing the skin with warming water temperatures (S. DiRocco, personal communication). Work by Van Bressem et al. (2009) with free-ranging animals strongly suggests anthropogenic factors as promoting expression of infection. Tattoo lesions commonly occur adjacent to or directly associated with areas of skin damage from conspecific trauma (rakes). Histologically, there is an increase in melanocytes in the basal layer, cytoplasmic vacuolation in the stratum intermedium, and mild hyperplasia within the stratum externum of the skin. Scattered within the stratum intermedium are small round, eosinophilic, intracytoplasmic viral inclusion bodies that displace the nucleus. Occasionally, viral inclusions are present within nuclei. Unless there is associated skin damage (as with rakes), inflammation is not a feature of these lesions. In spite of the hyperplasia of the stratum externum, these lesions are not raised.",

Serologic positivity to PV is high in free-ranging dolphins (90%) and common in captive dolphins (51%); ELISA reactivity is higher in males than females. The mean age of free-ranging dolphins with papillomas is \u223c11 years; it is \u223c30 years in captive dolphins. PV infection in bottlenose dolphins is common and the main route of transmission is likely horizontal with orogenital papilloma development early in life in certain free-ranging bottlenose dolphins (Rehtanz et al., 2010). PV-associated mucosal lesions are typical and an orogenital predilection with a tropism for vulvar and vaginal mucosa, penile mucosa, and oral or esophageal mucosa and frequent involvement of the frenulum of the tongue. While far less common, papillomatous proliferations in the skin of the body, have been seen in a variety of cetaceans including harbor porpoises, killer whales, and pilot whales.

Secondary infections as a consequence of profound immunosuppression are common and thus the presentation can vary based on the role of these additional pathogens. Secondary infections include Toxoplasma gondii, herpesviruses, opportunistic bacteria, such as Photobacterium damselae, Streptococcus phocae, and fungi including Aspergillus spp. Histologically, CeMV infection can be pancytopathic, but is primarily associated with lesions of the respiratory, lymphoid and central nervous system (CNS) organ systems. Interstitial pneumonia is characterized by necrosis of type I pneumocytes and bronchiolar epithelial cells, interstitial edema, type II pneumocyte hyperplasia, and formation of large syncytia in the alveolar and bronchiolar air spaces. Intracytoplasmic and intranuclear, eosinophilic viral inclusion bodies can be found in respiratory epithelia, bronchiolar gland epithelia, and syncytial cells. Generalized lymphoid depletion and edema with germinal center necrosis is common and syncytial cells (Warthin-Finkeldey type) are often prominent. The cortex of lymph nodes is generally the best site to identify inclusions within syncytia (Fig. 22.24\n); virus-laden cells are often difficult to identify in the face of opportunistic bacterial or fungal infections. Immunohistochemistry is very helpful in detecting these cells. Multifocal nonsuppurative meningoencephalitis with prominent perivascular cuffs, expansion of the meninges with edema, fibrin, hemorrhage and a mix of lymphocytes and plasma cells, and multifocal areas of demyelination characterizes brain lesions. Immunohistohemial (IHC) labeling using monoclonal antibodies (MoAb) to the hemagglutinin (H) glycoprotein of phocine distemper or neuraminidase (N) protein of canine distemper virus, or a rabbit polyclonal antiserum to rinderpest virus have been successfully used to diagnose CeMVs, and are valuable when tissue decomposition impedes histologic examination (Van Bressem et al., 2014).",

Real-time RT-PCR (rtRT-PCR) targeting the hypervariable C terminal domain of the N gene provides rapid and reliable detection of dolphin and porpoise morbilliviruses. This test is very sensitive and specific for either DMV or PMV and does not crossreact with a number of other important morbilliviruses (Van Bressem et al., 2014). Serological studies including virus neutralization (VN) tests, plaque reduction (PR) assays and indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (iELISAs) are the main platforms for detecting antibodies against CeMV.

In these animals, morbillivirus can be detected in lymphoid tissues as well as in the hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells and Kupffer cells, biliary epithelium, and myocytes in the tunica media blood vessels in the liver and mesenteric lymph nodes but not in the lungs or brain. If the pathogenesis of CeMV is similar to that of measles virus in humans, cetaceans that survive acute and subacute infection may show prolonged viral RNA persistence in the blood and lymphoid organs. Additionally, cetaceans that have cleared systemic DMV infection may develop lesions that localize only in the brain. Eosinophilic inclusions are only occasionally detected and syncytial cells are not observed. Neuronal processes have patchy positive immunostaining; some zones demonstrating almost no staining. In these cases, CeMV spread may be the result of cell-to-cell transmission rather than blood-borne infection. This CNS form shares histological characteristics with subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) and old dog encephalitis (ODE), chronic latent localized infections in humans and dogs caused by defective forms of MV and CDV infections, respectively. Lesions are localized predominantly in the cerebral cortex, subcortical white matter, and the thalamus. Perivascular cuffing, diffuse gliosis, and glial nodules with neurophagia are the most prominent changes. Demyelination is less prominent than in dolphins with the acute or sub-acute infection. As in the human and canine presentations, antigen and viral RNA can be detected in dolphin brains but the virus is difficult to isolate. The mechanism of demyelination is undetermined but delayed antigen and RNA clearance from the CNS may be related to the reduced immune surveillance (Van Bressem et al., 2014).",

Two forms of the disease exist, an acute fatal septicemic form, and a milder cutaneous form (Van Bressem et al., 2008). The acute presentation is associated with sudden death and few, if any, premonitory signs. On gross examination, these animals have ascites along with mottled livers. Histologically, there is moderate multifocal necrotizing lymphadenitis and hepatitis with a hepatic capsular edema, an influx of neutrophils with fewer mononuclear cells, and numerous intralesional Gram positive bacilli (Fig. 22.25\n). The milder, cutaneous form of the disease has been seen in display beluga whales and bottlenose dolphin calves. In these cases, a clear rhomboid shaped patch of skin discoloration and ulcerative dermatitis appears in association with a loss of appetite and an inflammatory leukogram (Fig. 22.26\n). These cases are responsive to antibiotics and the lesions resolve by regression with or without sloughing of the affected skin. Additionally, development of disease in calves from vaccinated dams in enzootic populations suggests a role of species-susceptibility or antibody transfer that is protective against the acute, septicemic form of the disease.",

This raise the possibility of transmission through vectors, such as Halocercus spp. and Pseudalius spp. lungworms in dolphins and porpoises, respectively, which can contain relatively large quantities of Brucella spp. Some of these parasites seem capable of crossing the placenta to affect another route of transmission from mother to the fetus (Guzm\u00e1n-Verri et al., 2012).",

Also seen multifocally were mild to moderate perivascular cuffing, fibrinoid degeneration, and necrosis with perivascular hemorrhage and edema. Expansion of inflamed tissues in the choriod plexus, leptomeninges, and the subependymal neuropil (periventriculitis) obstruct CSF flow and cause secondary hydrocephalus (Fig. 22.27A). Mononuclear choroiditis forming lymphoid follicles, periependymitis, and white matter and laminar necrosis and inflammation in the cerebrocortical gray matter have also been observed. Predilection sites are the cerebellum, brainstem, spinal cord, and medulla oblongata with less involvement of the cerebral cortex.

However, recent molecular studies have identified Paracoccidioides brasiliensis (Paracoccidioidomycosis ceti) as the causative organism (Vilela et al., 2016). This distinction may account for subtle ultrastructural distinctions in yeast morphology previously reported between dolphin and human cases. Dolphin infections are most commonly reported from Florida (United States) to the Gulf of Mexico and extend south into South America. Recent reports from Asia are suggestive of infections with a morphologically similar organism. Gross lesions tend to occur along the torso but may occur anywhere on the body, and consist of focally extensive to disseminated, smooth, cutaneous swellings that progress to papules, nodules, plaques, verrucae, and occasional ulcerations (Fig. 22.29A). Microscopically, the dermis is expanded and effaced by myriad, 6\u201310 \u03bcm diameter, round, thick-walled, PAS, and GMS positive (mucicarmine negative) yeast that form single to multiple budding cells or chains interconnected by a tubular isthmus. As with cryptococcosis, melanin may accumulate in or be associated with the cell wall and is considered a virulence factor, protective against oxidative stress. Yeast are embedded within lymphohistiocytic infiltrates admixed with numerous foreign body and Langhan\u2019s type multinucleated giant cells, fewer plasma cells and occasional neutrophils (Fig. 22.29B). The yeast are slow growing and depending on the stage of infection and degree of dermal infiltrate, pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia, acanthosis, and parakeratotic hyperkeratosis may also be seen; expansile dermal lesions, atrophy of the overlying epidermis with attenuation or loss of rete ridges and ulceration may also occur.

Regional lymph node involvement has been reported, but infection is usually limited to the skin and can persist in a nonprogressive state for many years. The mode of infection is believed to be direct penetration and subsequent proliferation in the dermis.",

The most common fungi associated with mucormycosis are Mucor spp., Rhizopus spp., Rhizomucor spp., Absidia spp., Aphophysomyces spp., and Saksenaea spp. (Abdo et al., 2012; Bossart et al., 2017; Higgins, 2000). All are distributed worldwide and typically associated with soil and detritus. Infections are most commonly acquired through inhalation, ingestion or percutaneous inoculation of spores. The fungi are angioinvasive and fungemia can result in disseminated infections. They are broad to ribbon like, have thin hyaline walls, are pauciseptate and nondichotomously branching. The hyphae are prone to twisting and folding. Vascular infections are associated with necrosis, vasculitis, perivascular hemorrhage, thromboembolism, ischemia, and infarction. An inflammatory response may be absent or consist of suppurative, pyogranulomatous, or granulomatous infiltrates. Individual case reports of localized dermatitis, cellulitis or myositis and disseminated mucormycosis (zygomycosis) have been documented in sporadic wild stranded and managed cetaceans; mucormycosis with pulmonary dissemination has also been reported secondary to satellite tag deployment in a southern killer whale. Entomophthoramycosis is generally limited to tropical regions and involves one of two genera, Basidiobolus spp. and Conidiobolus spp. Infections are more chronic, indolent and can arise through inhalation or direct inoculation of spores from decaying plant material, soil and leaves. Host animals are generally immunocompetent. In contrast to mucormycosis, fungi tend not to invade blood vessels and infections rarely disseminate from the primary site of infection. The hyphae are broad and pauciseptate with 90 degree branching. Skin and subcutaneous infections result in localized swelling, which may be fluctuant to firm. Microscopically there is granulomatous inflammation with foreign body multinucleated giant cells and Splendore-Hoeppli material. Eosinophils often accompany the inflammation and eosinophilic microabscessation may occur.",

Infections are generally opportunistic, acquired by inhalation with deposition of spores deep in the respiratory tract. From an epidemiologic perspective, aspergillosis in free-ranging cetaceans is often associated with morbillivirus co-infection. Initial stages of infection with airway oriented fungal hyphae are associated with invasion and necrosis in subjacent parenchyma. Gross examination reveals well delineated, grey nodules in the parenchyma with hemorrhagic margins or large cavitations composed predominantly of fungal hyphae. Dissemination to other tissues, such as the brain, kidney, and eye occur secondary to vascular invasion. Tracheal involvement with circumferential to segmental disruption and effacement of the respiratory mucosa by fibrosis and granulomatous infiltrates and variable luminal occlusion has been reported in four captive bottlenose dolphins (three with aspergillosis and one with possible zygomycosis). Severe mycotic otitis media due to A. terreus has also been described in a juvenile live stranded harbor porpoise from the United Kingdom. On gross exam, green yellow purulent exudate and caseous debris was noted in both tympanic cavities and the periotic sinuses; histologically, a large fungal aggregate was present in the tympanic cavity. Osteolytic changes were evident in the adjoining periotic bone and stapes, and small numbers of lymphocytes, plasma cells, neutrophils overlaid the scala vestibuli with granulation tissue, serous exudate, and pseudocyst formation associated with the round and oval windows.

Infections involved humans, companion animals, exotic birds, terrestrial wildlife, and among the first animals diagnosed with C. gattii infection was a harbor porpoise that stranded along the southeast coast of Vancouver Island, BC. In the Pacific Northwest, C gattii is the primary fungal pathogens recovered from stranded cetaceans and predominantly occurs in harbor porpoises, Dall\u2019s porpoises, and rarely in Pacific white sided dolphins. Gross lesions include generalized emaciation, pulmonary consolidation, and generalized lymphadenopathy. Pulmonary lesions vary from single large, tan yellow to gray red homogeneous and occasionally centrally friable nodules that protrude above the pleural surface and extend deep into and occasionally span the entire lung lobes. In more severe infections, the nodules are miliary or become confluent with secondary bacterial and verminous pneumonia. Prominent rib impressions may be apparent. Regional lymph nodes are markedly enlarged (up to 5\u201310 times normal size) and on cut surface may be homogenous, glistening yellow white, and ooze clear gelatinous material or multinodular, pale gray white to brown red and associated with inflammatory infiltrates, necrosis, hemorrhage, and cavitation. Microscopically, in the more acute stages of infection, pulmonary bronchoalveolar spaces are distended and occluded by dense aggregates of encapsulated yeast with sparse to mild infiltrates of lymphocytes and histiocytes. With progression of inflammation to more chronic stages, there is nodular to diffuse accumulations of granulomatous inflammation with scattered Langhan\u2019s type multinucleated giant cells, intra and extracellular yeast, and occasional fibrous encapsulation. Similar transition from small aggregates to variably extensive sheets of yeast is noted in the subcapsular and medullary sinuses of regional lymph nodes where yeasts are often admixed with mild lymphohistiocytic infiltrates. In more fulminant disease, evidence of multisystemic fungemia may be seen in the brain, kidney, prostate, or mammary glands, in developing feti and in other tissues. In contrast to terrestrial species, adrenal gland involvement tends to be localized to the medulla, rather than the cortex. The cell walls of organisms are best highlighted with methenamine silver and Fontana-Masson stains, and the capsule stains red with mucicarmine and blue with Alcian blue stains. Although fungal immunohistochemistry is available, fungal culture and isolation with molecular genotyping yields more valuable information.",

The life cycle of this parasite is likely complex, and infection is most likely acquired through consumption of infected fish (prey items) that contain the larval stages. Aberrant migration of this parasite can result in neuritis of the eighth cranial nerves, otitis media, and marked meningoencephalitis. Migration tracts in the both gray and white matter of the brain are associated with necrosis and cavitations, extensive areas of hemorrhage, edema, and an influx of gitter cells, degenerate neutrophils and eosinophils, lymphocytes, plasma cells, and intralesional black birefringent material (fluke pigment). Within the lesions, sections of adult trematodes and thick walled, golden-brown, triangular eggs approximately 50 \u03bcm in diameter are occasionally surrounded by multinucleated giant cells. Adult trematodes are 500 \u03bcm wide with a 15 \u03bcm thick, spiny tegument and contain numerous vitellaria, paired ceca, and testes, all surrounded by parenchyma. Spongiosis and gliosis may occur within the adjacent neural tissue, and the meninges and perivascular spaces are expanded by edema, fibrin, lymphocytes, plasma cells, eosinophils, and fewer neutrophils and hemosiderin-laden macrophages (Fig. 22.33\n). A study published in the mid-1980s found a high percentage of the cetaceans stranded along the Southern Californian coastline with massive infestation of Nasitrema spp., with mature, gravid (egg-bearing) helminths in the brain tissue (Cowan et al., 1986). Because of the extent and severity of encephalitis and necrosis of the neuropil, researchers have inferred that the brain lesions were a contributing factor to the stranding of small cetaceans. Interestingly, examinations of stranded cetaceans in this same region since 2000 have demonstrated a very low incidence of this condition despite thorough neuropathology exams. This shifting prevalence may reflect a change in the dietary preferences or prey availability or distribution in this region.",

One study identified death in 7 of 28 (25%) dolphins due to disseminated toxoplasmosis, including two of three Maui dolphins. A further ten dolphins had one or more tissues that were positive for the presence of T. gondii DNA using PCR. Fatal cases had intralesional protozoal zoites and cysts in areas of necrotizing and hemorrhagic pneumonia, lymphadenitis, hepatitis, and adrenalitis (Fig. 22.34A, B). Tachyzoites and tissue cysts were present in other organs including the brain, heart, stomach, and uterus with minimal associated inflammatory response. One dolphin had a marked suppurative metritis with numerous intraepithelial tachyzoites (Roe et al., 2013). Two of eight striped stranded dolphins in late 2007 on the Ligurian Sea coast of Italy had nonsuppurative meningoencephalitis characterized by prominent perivascular mononuclear cell cuffing and macrophage accumulations in the neuropil. These lesions were associated with mild lymphocytic and plasmacytic inflammation in the choroid plexus in one dolphin. Toxoplasma gondii cysts and zoites, confirmed by immunohistochemical labeling, were scattered throughout the brain parenchyma (Di Guardo et al., 2009).

Microscopic examination of a Pacific white-sided dolphin revealed marked, nonsuppurative and necrotizing meningoencephalitis with perivascular lymphoplasmacytic cuffing, scattered gliosis, and intralesional protozoal schizonts and dispersed merozoites. In contrast, a harbor porpoise presented with moderate interstitial pneumonia, peribronchial lymphofollicular hyperplasia and florid, predominantly intravascular accumulations of protozoa, mild nonsuppurative encephalitis, cholangiohepatitis, myocarditis, and tonsillitis. In both cases, immunohistochemistry was strongly positive for Sarcocystis neurona. Tissue exams of Atlantic white-sided dolphins performed by Ewing et al. (2002) demonstrated both skeletal muscle and cardiac incidental Sarcocystis spp. cysts in 39% of animals from two mass stranding events. Similar cysts have been seen in stranded beluga.",

They are a common commensal and do not suggest specific disease. They are referred to as \u201cwhale lice\u201d but they are not insects. They can be found anywhere on the skin. Typically, they reside in genital folds, ventral pleats, nostrils, are associated with callosities and barnacles, and occur at the periphery of the eyes and within and around skin wounds. The primary \u201cparty fact\u201d of cyamids is that each whale species generally has its own species of cyamid parasite. They do not experience a free-swimming phase and infections are transferred by contact. The parasites spread from dams to their calves during birth, nursing, and general contact. In the sperm whale, the parasitic relationship is sex-specific. Cyamus catodontis lives exclusively on the skin of the male, while Neocyamus physeteris is found only on females and calves. Cyamids consume the algae and sloughing superficial skin of their hosts. The rapid turnover of cetacean skin provides ample support for hundreds, even thousands of these organisms on individual whales.",

Normal cetacean lung has unique histologic features including cartilage extending into the level of the bronchioles, smooth muscle within the walls of the bronchioles forming a system of \u201cvalves\u201d and a double layer of epithelium sandwiching the alveolar capillaries. (see Fig. 22.3). eSlide: VM04950\n22.e2\nHepatic lipidosis, bottlenose dolphin, liver. This slide contains liver, kidney and lung from a young bottlenose dolphin. Sections of liver demonstrate diffuse clear vacuoles within the hepatic cytoplasm. (see Fig. 22.8). eSlide: VM05221\n22.e3\nLysosomal storage disease, beluga whale, brain (cerebrum). Within the brain there is moderate to severe neuronal and glial cell distention with granular to vacuolar pale tan cytoplasmic material. Affected cells are oval to round due to cytoplasmic distention. There are a few areas of perivascular edema and scattered meningeal vessels are occluded with foamy histiocytic cells. (see Fig. 22.10). eSlide: VM05224\n22.e4\nBarotrama, Intravascular and parenchymal bubbles, common dolphin, liver and adrenal gland. Tissues demonstrate a mix of multifocal clear dilation of blood vessels and lymphatics along with clear spaces within the parenchyma with no marginal capsule. In this slide, these areas are not associated with hemorrhage although in many cases, this is an associated change. (see Fig. 22.16). eSlide: VM05225\n22.e5\nPulmonary angiomatosis, bottlenose dolphin, lung. Pulmomary angiomatosis in the lung of a stranded bottlenose dolphin. There is a moderate to marked proliferation of small vessels with thick walls arranged in a haphazard pattern disrupting the bronchiole and replacing the pulmonary parenchyma. (see Fig. 22.20). eSlide: VM05226\n22.e6\nGenital papilloma, bottlenose dolphin, penis. There is irregular proliferation of the epithelium along papilliform fibrovascular changes in the submucosa. In these cases, the basement membrane remains intact and a change in size over time is not generally appreciated. (see Fig. 22.21). eSlide: VM05227\n22.e7\nOral squamous cell carcinoma, bottlenose dolphin, oral mucosa. There is irregular proliferation of epithelial cells forming islands that extend beneath the basement membrane of the oral mucosa. Islands often demonstrate central necrosis and keratin formation. Blood vessels can contain neoplastic thrombus. (see Fig. 22.22). eSlide: VM05228\n22.e8\nPox virus infection, bottlenose dolphin, skin. The skin contains a shallow, focal cavitation with surface erosions and generalized irregularity. There is prominent intracellular edema and vacuolation with nuclear margination primarily of the mid-level epithelial cells as they extend down rete pegs. Similar changes, including distinct eosinophilic cytoplasmic inclusions (Guarnieri-like) are present in epithelium at the base of epidermal pages and to adjacent epidermis. (see Fig. 22.23). eSlide: VM05229\n22.e9\nErysipelothrix, bottlenose dolphin, liver. Within the liver isacute periportal and capsular necrotizing hepatitis. There is marked capsular edema with neutrophils expanding the capsule and periportal regions. This change is often associated a marked acute ascites. (see Figure 22.25, Figure 22.26). eSlide: VM05246\n22.e10\nLobomycosis, bottlenose dolphin, skin. Abundant chains of budding yeast are present within a mixed pyogranumatous inflammatory reaction. (see Fig. 22.29). eSlide: VM05247\n22.e11\nBraunina, bottlenose dolphin, stomach. The gastric mucosa is covered by trematodes with an overlying mucous layer. There is very little associated inflammation. (see Fig. 22.32). eSlide: VM05250\n22.e12\nHyaline intracytoplasmic inclusions, killer whale, liver. Without evidence of a viral infection, it is most likely that this material represents aggregates of consolidated microtubes and is not indicative of a viral infection. (see Fig. 22.7). eSlide: VM05283\n22.e13\nAdrenocortical hyperplasia, killer whale, adrenal gland. There is irregular expansion of all layers of the adrenal cortex. The hyperplastic changes result in enlargement of the gland as well as an undulating pattern to the parts of the cortex. (see Fig. 22.14). eSlide: VM05284\n22.e14\nNocardia, Beluga whale, skin. The skin contains, moderate, diffuse epidermal hyperplasia and moderate to severe purulent tp pyogranulomatous dermatitis. There is a mix of mostly intact and some degenerate neutrophils and occasional histiocytic macrophages amidst areas of hemorrhage within the dermis. Multifocal vasculitis and necrosis are also seen. (see Fig. 22.28). eSlide: VM05285\n\n",
