HTS techniques (also termed next-generation sequencing, NGS) can directly identify genetic markers of unknown infectious agents in a pool of NAs from biological samples without using classical time-consuming virological or microbiological methods. However, total NA sequencing is not used in routine infectious disease diagnostics because of certain limitations. The genetic markers of a pathogen usually account for only a few reads among a huge number of background host-related sequences (human/animal and non-pathogenic environmental bacteria)7. For example, when HTS was used to identify the Schmallenberg virus, only192 out of 94,722 reads (0.2%) were mapped to its genome8.",

Some tools for viral NA enrichment are based on PCR with non-specific or genus-specific degenerate oligonucleotide primers. The preferential amplification of pathogenic sequence (PATHseq) is based on using a set of 88 specific 8-mer oligonucleotides (which do not match the sequences of the 2,000 most abundant human transcripts) as primers for the synthesis of secondary cDNA strands13. Alternatively, the VIDISCA method based on the presence of virus-specific endonuclease restriction sites was suggested14. Advanced VIDISCA uses non-rRNA binding hexamers in a reverse transcription (RT) reaction15. It is also possible to enrich viral sequences by a broad-range RT-PCR using a set of degenerate oligonucleotides16, 17.",

Oligonucleotide probes were designed based on the most conserved genome fragments and had 96.4\u2013100.0% sequence identity (considering degenerate positions as matches) with the viruses (54/56 positions in Flavi-8469 probe vs. YFV; 88/90 in Flavi-8844 vs. YFV; 53/53 in Flavi-9834 vs. YFV; 56/56 in Flavi-8469 vs. JEV; 89/90 in Flavi-8844 vs. JEV; 52/53 in Flavi-9834 vs. JEV). The hybridization oligonucleotides showed no preference towards YFV and JEV in the enrichment experiment. The data set for the oligonucleotide design included over 100 highly diversified flavivirus sequences, therefore, comparable enrichment efficiency may be expected for any known flavivirus. To further test the specificity range of the method, we tested whether it was possible to enrich the cDNA of one virus genus with hybridization probes designed for another genus of the same family. Indeed, it was possible to enrich the content of enterovirus cDNA using an oligonucleotide designed to to the FMDV virus (79.2% sequence identity between the FMDV oligonucleotide and the enterovirus). The Enterovirus and Aphthovirus genera are very distantly related within the Picornaviridae family. Therefore, the specificity breadth of the method goes beyond a genus and could cover distantly related genera within a highly diversified virus family.",

However, due to the extremely low fraction of a pathogen\u2019s genetic material in clinical samples, its usage is only cost-effective in very special cases. The proposed technique can enrich the share of pathogen genome fragments in a library, even if the NA sequence of a pathogen is currently unknown. It can also significantly enhance the utility of HTS for diagnostics.",
