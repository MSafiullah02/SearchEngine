However, the animal reservoir for SARS-CoV in nature remains to be identified and the mechanism of viral adaptation to human hosts requires further investigation.",

S1 is responsible for variations in host range and tissue tropism according to its receptor specificity, whereas S2 is responsible for cell entry following virus and host cell membrane fusion [10]. S1 is responsible for binding to cellular receptors; one potential SARS-CoV receptor has been identified as angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) [11]. S2 contains an internal fusion peptide and has two hydrophobic (heptad) repeat regions, designated HR1 and HR2 [12]. The putative fusion peptide has recently been identified upstream of and near to HR1 [13]. HR2 is located close to the transmembrane region, some 170 amino acids downstream of HR1 [12]. The classical mechanism of enveloped virus and host cell membrane fusion mediated by class I fusion proteins was established by Wiley and colleagues in their comprehensive study of influenza hemagglutinin (HA), with structures of the unprocessed precursor, the cleaved metastable HA1\u2013HA2 heterodimer and post-fusion conformations available [14, 15]. In the following years, extensive structural studies of the orthomyxovirus, retrovirus, paramyxovirus and filovirus families have led to a common fusion mechanism [15]. To confirm the value of fusion proteins as anti-viral targets, an HIV-1 membrane fusion inhibitory peptide, T-20 (developed by Trimeris, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, USA), which targets the prehairpin intermediate, was recently approved by the US Food and Drug Administration as a new anti-HIV drug [16].",

            "text": "In 2004, the structure of the S protein fusion core, consisting of the HR1 and HR2 regions, was determined by two groups in the post-fusion (or fusion-active) state [9\u2022\u2022, 17\u2022] (Figure 1\n). Xu and co-workers [17\u2022] constructed a single chain by engineering a linker between the HR1 and HR2 regions to prepare the fusion core (HR1: amino acids 900\u2013948; HR2: amino acids 1145\u20131184), whereas Supekar and colleagues [9\u2022\u2022] individually synthesized longer HR1 and HR2 peptides to prepare the complex (HR1: amino acids 889\u2013972; HR2: amino acids 1142\u20131185). Both structures exhibit a six-helix bundle in which three HR1 helices form a central coiled coil surrounded by three HR2 helices in an oblique antiparallel manner. HR2 peptides pack into the hydrophobic grooves of the HR1 trimer in a mixed extended and helical conformation; this represents a stable post-fusion structure, similar to that observed for HIV-1 gp41 [15]. The N terminus of HR1 and the C terminus of HR2 are located at the same end of the six-helix bundle, which would place the fusion peptide and transmembrane region close together. Supekar et al. [9\u2022\u2022] also provided the structure of an S2 fragment consisting of a smaller HR1 peptide (amino acids 919\u2013949) and an HR2 peptide with extra C-terminal residues in proximity to the transmembrane region (amino acids 1149\u20131193) (Figure 1). The C-terminal part is \u03b1 helical and points away from the HR1 trimer axis, probably due to the lack of stabilisation by the corresponding HR1 region. The authors consider that this could mimic the conformation of this region before the formation of the final post-fusion hairpins. A later structure was reported by Duquerroy and colleagues [18] (HR1: amino acids 890\u2013973; HR2: amino acids 1145\u20131190) (Figure 1), in which they emphasized the hydrogen-bonding network formed by conserved asparagine and glutamine residues, together with two possible chlorides, which could stabilise the conformation of post-fusion hairpins.",

Moreover, the efficacy of HR2 peptides derived from SARS-CoV S protein is lower than that of corresponding HR2 peptides derived from murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) in inhibiting MHV infection [20]. Supekar and colleagues considered that this might be due to the lower affinity of these peptides for the corresponding HR1 trimer [20], as a larger surface area is buried in the HR1\u2013HR2 interface of MHV S2 than in SARS-CoV S2 [9\u2022\u2022].

The authors identified a binding site for single-stranded RNA (ssRNA), using NMR to determine the resonance of residues perturbed by the addition of RNA, and revealed a similar mode of interaction to RNA-binding proteins such as U1A RNP.

The cleavage process is initiated by the enzyme's own autolytic cleavage from pp1a and pp1ab [30, 31].

These homology models were widely used in the design of anti-SARS inhibitors [32, 33]. In 2003, shortly after the peak of the SARS outbreak, Yang et al. reported the first crystal structure of SARS-CoV Mpro to 1.9 \u00c5 resolution, which provided important structural information for rational drug design (Figure 3\n) [29\u2022\u2022]. CoV Mpro forms a dimer and each protomer consists of three domains: domains I and II resemble chymotrypsin, whereas domain III has a globular cluster of five mostly antiparallel \u03b1 helices. The cleft between domains I and II is the location of substrate recognition and catalysis. Domain III and the additional N-terminal finger of domain I (or \u2018N-finger\u2019) are considered to influence the dimerisation and activity of Mpro [29\u2022\u2022, 34, 35, 36] (Figure 3). However, one group has reported incongruent results concerning the role of the N-finger in dimerisation [37]. In contrast to common serine proteases, which have a catalytic triad, CoV Mpro has a Cys-His catalytic dyad. An exceptionally stable water molecule occupies the position of the usual third member of the triad, which might stabilise the protonated histidine in the intermediate state during proteolytic cleavage.",

This most probably resulted from the comparatively weak binding of peptidyl elements derived from the substrate of TGEV Mpro and from the highly reactive electrophile CMK, suggesting that nucleophilic attack might have occurred before a stable non-covalently bound enzyme\u2013inhibitor complex was formed [38\u2022\u2022].",

(to 2.8 \u00c5 resolution) [45\u2022\u2022], have established its previously unknown function as an ssRNA-binding protein. Both groups report that the biological unit is a dimer. The core structure of the protein is an open six-stranded \u03b2 barrel reminiscent of, although unrelated to, the nucleic acid binding OB (oligosaccharide/oligonucleotide-binding) fold (Figure 2b). Instead, nsp9 is structurally homologous to certain subdomains of serine proteases, most notably domain II of SARS-CoV Mpro. Based on this similarity to the picornavirus 3C proteases, which feature a conserved RNA-binding motif, it was inferred that nsp9 should bind ssRNA; this was subsequently confirmed by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) [45\u2022\u2022] and surface plasmon resonance [44\u2022\u2022]. One role of nsp9 may be to stabilise nascent and template RNA strands during replication and transcription, and to protect them against nuclease processing. Besides replication, nsp9 may also be involved in base-pairing-driven processes, such as RNA processing.",

The Orf7a sequence has been identified in all isolates of SARS-CoV collected from both human and animal sources, but it appears to be unique to SARS, with no significant similarity to any other viral or non-viral protein. The structure of the luminal domain of the Orf7a accessory protein was determined earlier this year to 1.8 \u00c5 resolution. It reveals a compact Ig-like domain with a \u03b2-sandwich fold topology (Figure 2c), despite its unusually small size and lack of significant sequence similarity to other members of the Ig superfamily [47\u2022]. This common structural fold occurs in a wide variety of proteins, where it performs a diverse set of functions, making it difficult to predict the functional role of Orf7a from the structure alone. For example, the fold is found in proteins of the extracellular matrix, muscle proteins, proteins of the immune system, cell surface receptors, enzymes, transcription factors and a wide variety of viral proteins [48].",

The highly structured s2m RNA element includes a remarkable 90\u00b0 bend of the helix axis (Figure 2d). Several novel longer-range tertiary interactions create a tunnel perpendicular to the main helical axis, whose interior is negatively charged and binds two magnesium ions. These unusual features form probable surfaces for interaction with conserved host cell components or other reactive sites required for virus function. An interesting observation is the possible mimicry by s2m RNA of an rRNA fold, the 530 loop of 16S rRNA [51]. This implies a mechanism for RNA hijacking of host protein synthesis in SARS, similar to that observed in other RNA viruses [52]. The 530 loop of the 30S ribosome binds to prokaryotic proteins S12 and IF-1, further suggesting that s2m may interact with their eukaryotic homologues [49\u2022\u2022]. Nevertheless, the high sequence conservation of s2m in an otherwise rapidly mutable RNA genome implies its pathogenic importance and signals that it could be another attractive target for the design of anti-viral therapeutics.",

An important wealth of information and clues for further study have been accumulated from the SARS-CoV macromolecular structures determined so far. The first SARS-CoV structure to be determined, Mpro, is an important target for drug design and has been widely used since 2003 as a basis for inhibitor design, with promising results. Similarly, the S protein fusion core has also been confirmed as an important drug target for the design of fusion inhibitor peptides. Future prospects for SARS structural biology include the structures of replicase proteins alone and in protein\u2013protein complexes, with the aim of understanding the sophisticated function and assembly of the replication/transcription machinery, as well as the characterisation of the structural interaction between the SARS-CoV S protein and its possible cellular receptors, for instance, ACE2.",
