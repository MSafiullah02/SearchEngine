            "text": "Gastroenteritis in dogs and cats may be caused by an enormous array of microorganisms that include viral, bacterial, fungal, and protozoal pathogens (Table 88-1\n1., 2., 3., 4., 5.). Other parasites (such as nematodes) should also be considered on the differential diagnosis list. Enteropathogenic bacteria cause diarrhea by adhesion to or destruction of enterocytes, secretion of a variety of potent enterotoxins, and stimulation of the host inflammatory response. Many of these microbes can be detected in the feces of apparently healthy animals as well as the feces of those with clinical signs of diarrhea. Therefore, it may be difficult to ascertain the role that these organisms play in disease in a single patient. Clinical signs of diarrhea may be more likely to occur when multiple organisms are present simultaneously (\u201cpolyparasitism\u201d). In addition, other host factors (such as nutritional status or age) and bacterial virulence factors influence whether clinical signs develop. When outbreaks occur in dog and cat populations, collection of specimens from multiple affected and in-contact animals may be useful to determine the significance of one or more organisms involved. Use of antibiotics to treat bacterial diarrhea should be reserved for animals with systemic signs of illness such as fever, lethargy, and leukocytosis on the CBC.6 Other infections are self-limiting, and the mainstay of treatment is proper fluid therapy and supportive care.",

With the increased availability and sensitivity of ultrasound to detect and guide collection of small quantities of undiluted intra-abdominal fluid, DPL is now uncommonly performed in the author\u2019s practice. Peritoneal fluid from dogs and cats with bacterial peritonitis is typically a modified transudate or exudate, although fluid from dogs with primary peritonitis may be more likely to be a modified transudate or transudate.7 Fluid analysis from most animals with peritonitis reveals a high protein concentration and an increased erythrocyte and total nucleated cell count (usually >500 cells/\u00b5L and up to 160,000 cells/\u00b5L). There is typically a predominance of neutrophils that may have a degenerate appearance, and foreign material and/or intracellular and extracellular bacteria may be seen. The presence of intracellular bacteria is generally considered diagnostic for bacterial peritonitis. Because an absence of bacteria does not rule out bacterial peritonitis, submission of fluid for culture is essential.10., 14. A blood-to-fluid glucose difference greater than 20 mg/dL was 100% sensitive and 100% specific for a diagnosis of bacterial peritonitis in one study of dogs and cats.18\n",

The need for subsequent drainage is controversial. Drainage is generally selected when debridement and lavage cannot adequately reduce contamination. Methods of drainage include primary closure with closed suction drains, open peritoneal drainage, and, most recently, vacuum-assisted peritoneal drainage.10., 12., 17., 20., 21., 22. In retrospective studies, no significant differences in survival have been identified among methods, but prospective studies are required. Complications of drainage are ascending nosocomial infection, obstruction of closed suction drains by omentum, and hypoproteinemia. Evisceration and bowel desiccation have the potential to occur with open peritoneal drainage, and fluid production cannot be quantified. Dogs and cats that undergo open drainage are also more likely to require plasma or blood transfusions and may have longer hospitalization times.17 Frequent sedation or anesthesia for bandage changes is also required.",

Negative prognostic indicators identified in dogs with bacterial peritonitis include a diagnosis of primary as opposed to secondary peritonitis7; preoperative anemia, leukocytosis, or hypoproteinemia16; and postoperative administration of glucocorticoids.16 Low preoperative systolic blood pressure was a negative prognostic factor in a study that included both dogs and cats.14 Low preoperative median serum ALT activity (56 U/L for surviving cats compared with 179 U/L for non-survivors) was the only positive prognostic indicator in one study of cats with peritonitis.10 Age, preoperative heart rate, rectal temperature, the results of other laboratory parameters, or the presence of polymicrobial infection did not affect survival. In another study, a high plasma lactate concentration was a negative prognostic indicator in cats with bacterial peritonitis.15\n",

The main mechanism thought to be involved is ascending infections of the biliary tree, although hematogenous spread and bacterial translocation from the portal system are other proposed mechanisms.23 They have been associated with suppurative cholangitis/cholangiohepatitis, cholecystitis, choledochitis, and cholelithiasis.24., 25., 26., 27., 28., 29., 30., 31.\nCholangitis is inflammation of intrahepatic bile ducts, whereas cholangiohepatitis is inflammation of the bile ducts that has spread to the adjacent liver parenchyma. The use of the term \u201ccholangitis\u201d (rather than \u201ccholangiohepatitis\u201d) has been recommended by the WSAVA Liver Diseases and Pathology Standardization Group, because of the variable existence of hepatic involvement, so this term will be used from this point onward. In cats, cholangitis has been classified histologically as neutrophilic cholangitis, lymphocytic cholangitis, or chronic cholangitis associated with liver fluke infestation. Neutrophilic cholangitis can be further subclassified as acute or chronic depending on the presence of fibrosis, fibroplasia, or bile duct proliferation.32 Neutrophilic cholangitis is thought to develop as a result of ascending bacterial infection from the gastrointestinal tract, which may occur secondary to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and/or pancreatitis (Figure 88-2\n). It is hypothesized that the common entry of the pancreatic and common bile ducts into the intestine in cats may predispose them to concurrent intestinal, pancreatic, and biliary disease due to pancreatic and hepatobiliary reflux in the face of IBD (\u201ctriaditis\u201d). However, not all cats with cholangitis have histologic evidence of associated pancreatitis or IBD. Cats with acute neutrophilic cholangitis tend to be younger than those with chronic neutrophilic cholangitis.32., 33. Retrovirus infection does not appear to be a predisposing factor. The cause of lymphocytic cholangitis is unclear; currently it is thought to be an immune-mediated condition.34 Chronic cholangitis associated with liver fluke infestation is rare and is primarily reported from regions with subtropical climates such as the southeastern United States and Hawaii, but disease can occur in non-endemic areas in traveled cats. Several different fluke species may be involved, but the most prevalent appears to be Platynosomum concinnum.35\n",

Antimicrobial drug resistance among bacteria isolated from the bile of dogs and cats with cholecystitis and cholangitis has been described in several studies, and so culture and susceptibility testing should be performed whenever possible. When cholecystocentesis is undesirable because of concerns for gallbladder rupture (see Cytologic Examination), blood cultures may be useful, although the utility of blood culture in dogs and cats with cholecystitis has not been studied. In human patients, bile cultures are positive in 50% to 95% of patients with acute cholecystitis, and blood cultures are positive in 30% to 40% of patients.44\n",

Abscesses may also be discovered during exploratory laparotomy (e.g., in dogs and cats with bacterial peritonitis). Culture and susceptibility of aspirates of the liver abscesses, free peritoneal fluid, and/or blood should be performed. Effective treatment of solitary abscesses relies on appropriate antimicrobial drug treatment together with complete or partial liver lobectomy, or abscess drainage and omentalization. With the exception of microabscesses, antimicrobial drug therapy alone is often ineffective. Aggressive supportive care in an intensive care unit may be required. Initial antimicrobial drug treatment should be broad spectrum, after which it should be adjusted based on the results of culture and susceptibility. Mortality rates of 50% and 79% have been reported for dogs and cats, respectively.45 The prognosis is especially poor when multiple abscesses are present.45., 46.\n",

            "text": "In dogs and cats, pancreatitis and pancreatic abscess formation most often appears to be a sterile process that results from tissue destruction and necrosis by pancreatic enzymes. Experimentally, necrotizing pancreatitis can be complicated by secondary bacterial invasion due to ascending infection from the duodenum or bacterial translocation,49., 50. although the extent to which this occurs in dogs and cats with naturally-occurring pancreatitis remains unclear. Occasionally, pancreatitis results from hematogenous spread of bacteria to the pancreas, usually in addition to other organs (see Table 86-2). Other microorganisms known to cause pancreatitis as a result of systemic infection include Leptospira species, Toxoplasma gondii, and fungi such as Cryptococcus neoformans. In cats, pancreatitis can also result from invasion by flukes (Eurytrema procyonis).\n51 When a primary infectious cause of pancreatitis cannot clearly be identified, the use of antimicrobial drugs to treat pancreatitis in dogs and cats is controversial. If used, the primary goal of antimicrobial treatment is to prevent or treat secondary ascending bacterial infection or bacterial translocation; treatment should target enteric bacteria. However, no evidence currently exists that use of antimicrobials alters outcome in dogs and cats with naturally occurring pancreatitis, and it has the potential to select for infection by multidrug-resistant enteric pathogens. In addition, many widely used antimicrobial drugs in veterinary medicine (such as \u03b2-lactams and aminoglycosides) penetrate inflamed pancreatic tissue poorly. Suitable choices include fluoroquinolones (for gram-negative aerobes), third-generation cephalosporines, and metronidazole (for anaerobes).CASE EXAMPLESignalment\u201cGeorge,\u201d a 16-year-old male neutered domestic shorthair from northern CaliforniaHistoryGeorge was evaluated for a 2-day history of vomiting and progressive lethargy and inappetence. The owners reported that the vomiting occurred six times at the onset of illness and was associated with apparent abdominal pain but had since ceased. The day he became ill, he was seen at an emergency clinic where a CBC showed only a mild left shift (479 band neutrophils), a chemistry panel showed mild hypokalemia (3.1 mmol/L, reference range 3.6-4.9 mmol/L), and a total serum T4 concentration was increased (10.2 \u00b5g/dL, reference range, 1.1-3.3 \u00b5g/dL). Pancreatitis was suspected and George was initially treated with subcutaneous lactated Ringer\u2019s solution (200 mL SC q24h), mucosal buprenorphine (0.02 mg/kg PO q8h to q12h), and ondansetron (0.2 mg/kg PO q12h) pending the results of laboratory testing. However, because George became inappetent and lethargic, he was returned for reevaluation the following day.Other medical history: George had been diagnosed with pancreatitis 8 months previously. He was also diagnosed with a biliary cystadenoma at that time. He had been hospitalized for 9 days and treated with jejunostomy tube feeding. Since then, he had been well until this recent onset of illness.Physical ExaminationBody Weight6.1 kg.GeneralQuiet, alert, hydrated. T = 103.8\u00b0F (39.9\u00b0C), HR = 240 beats/min, RR = 32, mucous membranes pink and moist, CRT = 1 s.Eyes, Ears, Nose, and ThroatPalpable thyroid nodule.MusculoskeletalBody condition score was 5/9. The cat was ambulatory with normal gait.CardiovascularA gallop rhythm was present. No murmurs or arrhythmias were auscultated. Femoral pulses were strong and synchronous.Genitourinary/GastrointestinalSoft, mildly painful abdomen. The urinary bladder was small.Other Systems, Including Peripheral Lymph NodesNo clinically significant findings.Imaging FindingsAbdominal UltrasoundThe margins of the kidneys were irregular, and there was decreased corticomedullary distinction. In the region of the left limb of the pancreas, the mesentery was markedly hyperechoic and hyperattenuating. There was diffuse thickening of the muscularis of the small bowel. There was no evidence of mesenteric lymphadenomegaly. There was a small amount of free anechoic peritoneal fluid.Thoracic RadiographsThe cardiac silhouette appeared mildly enlarged. There was a mild bronchointerstitial pattern throughout the thorax. There was poor serosal detail within the viewable cranial abdomen.OutcomeGeorge was treated supportively for pancreatitis with intravenous fluids (lactated Ringer\u2019s solution with 20 mEq/L KCl at 15 mL/hr), buprenorphine (0.01 mg/kg IV q6h), famotidine (0.5 mg/kg IV q12h), and ondansetron (0.5 mg/kg IV q12h). His temperature normalized, but he showed no interest in food or his surroundings. Cytologic examination of an ultrasound-guided liver aspirate on day 2 of hospitalization showed moderate hepatic lipidosis and mild mixed inflammation. Laboratory testing was reevaluated and an echocardiogram was performed on the third day of hospitalization in preparation for anesthesia and placement of an esophageal feeding tube. The echocardiogram was unremarkable; the gallop rhythm was suspected to result from a systolic click. New findings on the CBC were mild, nonregenerative anemia (HCT 29.9%, RR 30%-50%), with a WBC of 11,580 cells/\u00b5L (4500-14,000 cells/\u00b5L), 4053 neutrophils/\u00b5L (2000-9000 cells/\u00b5L), bandemia (3242 cells/\u00b5L), and circulating metamyelocytes (232 cells/\u00b5L). Findings on the serum biochemistry panel included a bicarbonate of 24 mmol/L (15-21 mmol/L), calcium of 8.3 mg/dL (9.0-10.9 mg/dL), BUN of 20 mg/dL (18-33 mg/dL), creatinine of 0.8 mg/dL (1.1-2.2 mg/dL), glucose of 114 mg/dL (63-118 mg/dL), total protein of 5.3 g/dL (6.6-8.4 g/dL), albumin of 2.0 g/dL (2.2-4.6 g/dL), globulin of 3.3 g/dL (2.8-5.4 g/dL), ALT of 57 U/L (27-101 U/L), AST of 46 U/L (17-58 U/L), ALP of 26 U/L (14-71 U/L), GGT of <3 U/L (0-4 U/L), cholesterol of 109 mg/dL (89-258 mg/dL), and total bilirubin of 0.4 mg/dL (0-0.2 mg/dL). Urinalysis showed a specific gravity of 1.015; pH 7.0, protein 25 mg/dL, no bilirubin, 25 erythrocytes/\u00b5L hemoprotein, 1-3 WBC/HPF, 1-6 RBC/HPF, and many lipid droplets. Serum vitamin B12 and folate concentrations were 383 ng/L (279-1254 ng/L) and 7.5 ng/mL (10.4-20.7 ng/mL), respectively.Because of the severely left-shifted neutrophil count and mild hyperbilirubinemia, bacterial cholecystitis was suspected. Findings on abdominal ultrasonography were unchanged from the previous examination. Ultrasound-guided cholecystocentesis was performed while George was under anesthesia for esophagostomy tube placement, and a small volume of the scant peritoneal fluid present was also collected.Microbiologic TestingCytologic Examination (Bile)Smears had light blue backgrounds and contained a moderate amount of unidentified material. Nucleated cells were not found, but many short, plump coccobacilli were seen. Most of the bacteria were in large clusters, but a few groups were in chains.Peritoneal Fluid AnalysisGrossly the fluid was pink and cloudy, and it had a yellow, clear supernatant. The total protein concentration was 2.8 g/dL and there were 100,000 RBC/\u00b5L. There were 5380 nucleated cells/\u00b5L, with 70% nondegenerate neutrophils, 6% small and well-differentiated lymphocytes, 7% foamy macrophages, and 17% eosinophils. No infectious agents were identified.Aerobic and Anaerobic Bacterial Culture (Bile)Large numbers of Enterococcus faecium. No anaerobes were cultured. The isolate was susceptible to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (\u22644 \u00b5g/mL), ampicillin (\u22640.25 \u00b5g/mL), penicillin (0.12 \u00b5g/mL), chloramphenicol (\u22644 \u00b5g/mL), doxycycline (\u22642 \u00b5g/mL), imipenem (\u22641 \u00b5g/mL); had intermediate susceptibility to erythromycin (1 \u00b5g/mL); and was resistant to rifampin (>2 \u00b5g/mL).Aerobic and Anaerobic Bacterial Culture (Peritoneal Fluid)Very small numbers of Enterococcus faecium. The antibiogram was identical to the isolate from the bile.DiagnosisPeritonitis and suspected bacterial cholecystitis caused by E. faecium; pancreatitis and secondary hepatic lipidosis.TreatmentMedical treatment with ampicillin-sulbactam (20 mg/kg [ampicillin component] IV q8h) and enrofloxacin (5 mg/kg slow IV q24h) was commenced on day 3 of hospitalization, before the results of culture and susceptibility were available. Treatment was also continued with intravenous fluids, buprenorphine, famotidine, ondansetron, and nutrition through the esophageal feeding tube with a slurry of a commercially available gastroenteric diet (Purina EN Feline Formula, q4h). Surgery was considered, but because George was stable and the amount of free peritoneal fluid was scant, a decision was made to continue medical treatment with close observation and serial CBC and abdominal ultrasound examinations. Within 12 hours of antibiotic treatment, George was brighter. A repeat abdominal ultrasound showed no changes except that mildly enlarged and hypoechoic mesenteric lymph nodes were identified. The CBC showed persistent nonregenerative anemia (HCT of 26.4%), 10,181 neutrophils/\u00b5L, 5553 bands/\u00b5L, 185 metamyelocytes/\u00b5L, and a normal platelet count (305,000/\u00b5L) with moderately toxic neutrophils. On day 5 of hospitalization, ultrasonography showed a decrease in the amount of peritoneal fluid. The enrofloxacin was discontinued when the results of culture and susceptibility became available. On day 6, the CBC showed a stable HCT, 9366 neutrophils/\u00b5L, 2810 bands/\u00b5L, moderately toxic neutrophils, and no metamyelocytes. A serum chemistry panel was unremarkable, and the total bilirubin was 0.1 mg/dL. On day 8, George began eating a small amount of food on his own, and the CBC showed further improvement with 6048 neutrophils/\u00b5L, 336 bands/\u00b5L, mild monocytosis (896 cells/\u00b5L), and no toxic neutrophils. He was discharged from the hospital the following day with instructions to continue tube feeding, ondansetron (0.3 mg/kg PO q24h), famotidine (0.5 mg/kg PO q12h), and amoxicillin\u2013clavulanic acid (15 mg/kg PO q12h). At a recheck 1 week later, the owner reported that George had been doing well at home, although he had vomited three times over the course of the week. Physical examination was unremarkable, apart from the thyroid nodule and mild weight loss (body weight, 5.6 kg compared with 5.9 kg at discharge). A CBC showed a HCT of 30%, 10,592 neutrophils/\u00b5L, and 132 bands/\u00b5L. A serum chemistry panel was within normal limits, and the total T4 concentration was 8.2 \u00b5g/dL. Treatment with methimazole (1.25 mg q12h) was initiated for the hyperthyroidism, but because of continued vomiting, this was discontinued after three doses. George continued to improve. A week later he was eating canned and dry food on his own with no vomiting, a CBC showed no abnormalities, and the antibiotics were discontinued. The esophageal tube was removed 3 weeks later, and methimazole was reinstituted, after which his T4 normalized. Six months later George was still doing well.CommentsIn this cat, bacterial peritonitis and suspected cholecystitis were diagnosed based on cytologic and microbiologic analysis of bile and peritoneal fluid. However, there were no ultrasonographic abnormalities within the biliary tract, and cytologic evidence of inflammation in the bile was absent. Pancreatitis may have predisposed the cat to ascending infection of the biliary tract, and/or infection may have resulted from bacterial translocation. The lack of an inflammatory reaction in the bile was unusual, but it may have resulted from marked neutrophil degeneration in a toxic environment. Isolation of the same organism from both the bile and the peritoneal fluid and the rapid clinical response to antibiotic treatment suggested that Enterococcus played a role in disease in this cat, although some of the clinical signs and hematologic abnormalities may also have resulted from severe pancreatitis and hepatic lipidosis. Surgery was postponed with careful monitoring because the peritonitis appeared to be very low grade and there was concern it might exacerbate pancreatitis. Fortunately, the cat made a complete recovery. See Chapter 8 for precautions regarding administration of enrofloxacin to cats.\n",
