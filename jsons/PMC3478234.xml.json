The intensity of contact between wildlife, livestock and human population is increasing due to a number of factors, primarily human and livestock population growth leading to encroachment onto wildlife habitat [1,2]. During recent decades a number of pathogen crossovers from wildlife to humans and livestock have occurred resulting in emerging diseases, such as SARS, Hantavirus Pulmonary syndrome 1, Nipah virus disease 1, and Hendra virus-induced diseases among others. However, it is also evident that transmission can occur both ways i.e. pathogens may spill-over to wildlife from humans and/or from livestock. One example of this is the spill-over of Canine distemper virus from domestic dogs (Canis familiaris) to African wild dogs (Lycaon pictus) in Serengeti in 1991 leading to local extinction of wild dogs in the area [2]. Apart from being carriers of novel viruses with the potential to cause disease in na\u00efve domestic hosts, wildlife may also act as reservoirs for known viral pathogens \u2013 for example there are a number of wildlife reservoirs for foot and mouth disease virus such as African buffalo (Syncerus caffer), reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) and wild boar (Sus scrofa) [3]. However, information on the viral flora in wildlife is typically scarce or non-existent.",

The divergence of many viruses and absence of a common viral marker gene makes detection difficult using standard molecular techniques including PCR and microarray as they are frequently target-specific through the use of specific primers, probes and/or antibodies. Viral metagenomics is a sequence, and culture-independent approach that has proven to be a valuable tool for the investigation not only of diseases of unknown etiology but also of the complete viral flora of different reservoirs and vectors. By providing insights into a wide range of unknown potential pathogens and revealing novel aspects of biodiversity, metagenomics is able to detect and characterise novel pathogens [4-6].",

In some parts of Uganda, free-range scavenging by pigs is frequent. At the same time wild species of suidae such as bushpigs (Potamochoerus larvatus), with a wide distribution in Eastern and Southern Africa, live and move at the interface between the national parks and the farmland where there is an opportunity for interaction and sharing of pathogens with domestic relatives. Bushpigs are considered to be possible natural reservoirs for African swine fever virus [7], but less is known about what other viruses bushpigs might carry. Therefore, to investigate whether bushpigs are carriers of known and or unknown porcine viruses we have in this study investigated the viral flora of bushpig sera.",

Porcine parvovirus 4 was originally discovered in 2010 in samples collected from pigs in North Carolina in 2005 after an outbreak of acute-onset of disease with high mortality [12]. Subsequently, PPV4 was reported in pigs in China where 1.84% of the investigated pigs were PPV4 positive [13]. The genome of parvoviruses consists of two major open reading frames (ORF) encoding the non-structural and the capsid proteins. However, the genomes of PPV4 as well as of PBoV contain an additional third ORF [12]. The parvovirus sequences obtained from this study could be found in the capsid and in the non-structural ORF. All reads classified as parvovirus gave significant similarity to PPV4 through Blastx searches. A PCR with primers designed to amplify PPV4-like sequences from the original extracted genetic material showed the presence of this virus in one of the three bushpig sera. Sequencing of the PCR product (GenBank accession number: JQ277337) confirmed correct amplification and sequence analysis showed that at protein level (84 amino acids), the product displayed a 75.9-77.1% sequence similarity to the PPV4 sequences available in GenBank. In addition, the phylogenetic tree generated from these data (Figure1) grouped the sequence with PPV4 when analysed together with sequences from all the different parvovirus genera (ParvovirusErythrovirusDependovirusAmdovirus and Bocavirus) and PPV4. However, the tree also confirms the divergence of the bushpig PPV4 from the other PPV4.",

These viruses have small (approximately 2.8 kb) circular DNA genomes. Torque teno virus in pigs is divided into two different species, Torque teno sus virus 1 and 2, and prevalence studies have shown that TTSuV is widely spread in pig populations across the world [16,17].

The results from the specific PCR assays showed that one of the TTSuV-1 variants (here named TTSuV-1a) could be found in two of the three bushpig sera while the other one (here named TTSuV-1b) was found in all three. The sequence analysis of the PCR amplified TTSuV-1 products (GenBank accession number JQ277338 - 42) showed a sequence similarity between TTSuV-1a and b on protein level at 53\u201354.5% in the analysed 66 amino acid region. Compared to sequences from other studies, TTSuV-1a showed a 60.6-84.8% protein sequence similarity while TTSuV-1b was more divergent (50-56% similarity). These protein sequence identity values were similar to those seen when comparing the sequences retrieved from the GenBank with each other (59-100% similarity). The phylogenetic tree (Figure2) also indicated that TTSuV-1b was more divergent than the other sequences. Sequences from different parts of the world such as China, Germany, Spain, US etc. was used in the phylogenetic study however no clear geographical clustering was seen.",
