The presence of DNA sequence variations in regulatory region might interfere with transcription of TNF gene, influencing the circulating level of TNF and thus increases the susceptibility to human diseases (infectious, cancer, autoimmune, neurodegenerative and other diseases). In this review, we have comprehensively analysed various published case-control studies of different types of human diseases, in which TNF gene polymorphism played a role, and computationally predicted several single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) lie in transcription factor-binding sites (TFBS) of transcription factors (TFs). It has been observed that TNF enhancer polymorphism is implicated in several diseases, and TNF rs1800629 and rs361525 SNPs are the most important in human disease susceptibility as these might influence the transcription of TNF gene. Thirty-two SNPs lies in TFBS of 20 TFs have been detected in the TNF upstream region.

The inflammatory effects of TNF are mediated mainly by activation of the transcription factor NF-jB and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). TNF binds to TNFR1 (receptor subunits, p55-p60) and TNFR2 (receptor subunits, p75-p80). TNFR1 is constitutively expressed by most cell types, and TNFR2 expression is induced mainly in immune and endothelial cells. Therefore, any factor that affects the serum level of TNF might be important in outcome of disease. The presence of polymorphism in regulatory region may alter regulation expression level and thus affect disease manifestation. Regulation of gene expression at the level of transcription is the most important. Several mechanisms play important role in gene regulation. Promoter hypermethylation and the presence of polymorphism in regulatory region are the two most important factors that interfere with the gene regulation, and our hypothesis is that during disease conditions, there is upregulation or downregulation of gene (transcriptional dysregulation). For example, infection of Plasmodium falciparum upregulates the expression of TNF-a. In certain cancers, there is downregulation of genes. Promoter polymorphism lies in transcription factor-binding sites (cis elements) and hypermethylation of CpG (CG dinucleotide) islands can contribute to dysregulation. CpG islands are present in the promoters regions of almost half of mammalian genes [147] , leading to gene silencing.
