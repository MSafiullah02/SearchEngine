A set of clinical and laboratory criteria necessary for an ideal diagnostic marker of infection have previously been proposed by Ng and his colleagues [8] . According these criteria, an ideal biomarker should possess at a minimum the following characteristics: (a) biochemically, a biomarker should be stable and remain significantly deregulated in the body fluid compartment for at least 12-24 h even after commencement of appropriate treatment that may allow an adequate time window for specimen collection or storage without significant decomposition of the active compound until laboratory processing; (b) its concentration should be determined quantitatively, and the method of measurement should be automatic, rapid, easy, and inexpensive; (c) the collection of a specimen should be minimally invasive and require a small volume (e.g., <0.5 mL blood).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 198, "end": 201, "text": "[1,", "ref_id": "BIBREF0"}, {"start": 202, "end": 204, "text": "2]", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 412, "end": 415, "text": "[3,", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 416, "end": 418, "text": "4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 468, "end": 471, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 472, "end": 475, "text": "[6]", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 476, "end": 479, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 705, "end": 708, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Numerous biomarkers have been found and tested in clinical practice [1] [2] [3] [4] .

The pre-miRNAs are transported to cytoplasm by exportin-5 protein and then are cleaved by Dicer RNase III to form a mature double-stranded miRNA. One strand of the miRNA duplex is subsequently unwound and then incorporated into an effector protein complex termed RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), which is responsible for the gene silencing in a posttranscriptional manner [12] [13] [14] . Mature miRNAs are single-stranded RNA molecules of about 19-25 nucleotides in length.

According to miRBase 21.0 (http://microrna.sanger.org/), which is a collective registry of currently known miRNA sequences and targets hosted by the Sanger Institute, there are currently 2588 recognized miRNA sequences in the Homo sapiens genome; this number is constantly growing as new miRNA sequences are discovered. Importantly, miRNAs have been detected in human body fluids, including peripheral blood plasma; these circulating miRNAs are found as extracellular nuclease-resistant entities that are strikingly stable in blood plasma [16] . Such miR-NAs have been found circulating not only in serum and plasma but also in other body fluids such as saliva, tears, and urine [17] . Some of these miRNAs appear to be enriched in specific fluids [17, 18] . These circulating miRNAs subsequently have become the focus of ongoing research. The properties, origin, function, and relationship with disease of circulating miRNAs have been intensively investigated [16] [17] [18] [19] . A number of important observations have been noted. Circulating miRNAs are present in a stable form that is protected from endogenous RNase activity [16, 19, 20] . Most extracellular circulating miRNAs in plasma completely pass through 0.22 micron filters but remain in the supernatant after ultracentrifugation at 110,000 g, which indicates the non-vesicular origin of these miRNAs [16] . Finally, circulating miRNAs have been shown to co-immunoprecipitate with the 96 kDa Ago2 protein; this Ago2 protein is part of an RNA-induced silencing complex [16] and might account for the high stability of this comlex [16] . Some groups also reported a higher stability of miRNAs compared to mRNA in samples obtained from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues [21] [22] [23] . The expression level of miRNAs has been noted as consistent among individuals of the same species [19] . Expression alteration of circulating miRNAs has been reported to be associated with pathophysiological states including various cancers, heart disease, pregnancy, and diabetes [24, 25] . Needless to say, serum, plasma, and other body fluid specimens are generally available for clinical testing. Profiling hundreds of miRNA requires only 200 ul of sera [20] . Thus, these unique and stable characteristics of circulating miRNAs potentially make them extremely useful biomarkers for disease diagnosis and prognosis. The potential use of tissue and/or circulating miRNAs for diagnosing cancer was quickly recognized [12, 13, [18] [19] [20] 22] . The discovery of virus-encoded miRNAs and the recognition that such miRNAs played multiple roles in virus infections has resulted in their use in diagnosing viral infections [5, [26] [27] [28] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 77, "end": 81, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 623, "end": 627, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 763, "end": 767, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 832, "end": 836, "text": "[17,", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 837, "end": 840, "text": "18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1045, "end": 1049, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1050, "end": 1054, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1055, "end": 1059, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1060, "end": 1064, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1216, "end": 1220, "text": "[16,", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1221, "end": 1224, "text": "19,", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1225, "end": 1228, "text": "20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 1450, "end": 1454, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1617, "end": 1621, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1678, "end": 1682, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1823, "end": 1827, "text": "[21]", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1828, "end": 1832, "text": "[22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 1833, "end": 1837, "text": "[23]", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 1938, "end": 1942, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 2121, "end": 2125, "text": "[24,", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 2126, "end": 2129, "text": "25]", "ref_id": "BIBREF24"}, {"start": 2298, "end": 2302, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 2559, "end": 2563, "text": "[12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 2564, "end": 2567, "text": "13,", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 2568, "end": 2572, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 2573, "end": 2577, "text": "[19]", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 2578, "end": 2582, "text": "[20]", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}, {"start": 2583, "end": 2586, "text": "22]", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}, {"start": 2763, "end": 2766, "text": "[5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 2767, "end": 2771, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 2772, "end": 2776, "text": "[27]", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 2777, "end": 2781, "text": "[28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Virus-encoded miRNAs were recognized as having many functions in viral infections, including controls for viral replication and thus potentially limiting antiviral responses, inhibition of apoptosis, and stimulation of cellular growth [26] . Moreover, unique host cell miRNAs expression profiles have been revealed in response to various microbial infections [27, 28] . Host miRNA thus appears to play an important role in viral replication and may be used by host cells to control viral infection. The first virus-encoded miRNA was described by Pfeffer and his colleagues in 2004 when they identified five EBV-encoded pre-miRNAs [29] . Since then, hundreds of virus-encoded miRNAs have been described in humans, animals, and plants. Examples of human virus-encoded miRNA are shown in Table 1 . Bewilderingly, more than 95% of the virus-encoded miRNAs known today are of herpesvirus origin [30] . Herpesvirus miRNAs were initially determined to not be required for lytic replication, but were thought to strongly enhance viral pathogenesis, including oncogenesis, and also to promote latently infected cells [30] . Subsequently, the role of herpesvirus miRNAs in virus latency and persistence has been confirmed, with specific cellular miRNAs being identified as inhibiting reactivation of herpesviruses, thereby promoting latent infections [31, 32] . Interestingly, almost all virusencoded miRNAs are encoded by DNA viruses except those encoded by retroviruses, which reverse-transcribe and integrate their genetic material into host DNA. Aberrantly expressed circulating miRNAs have been explored for the diagnosis and prognosis of several infectious diseases, including sepsis [33, 34] , HBV [35] , and HCV [36] .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 235, "end": 239, "text": "[26]", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}, {"start": 359, "end": 363, "text": "[27,", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 364, "end": 367, "text": "28]", "ref_id": "BIBREF27"}, {"start": 630, "end": 634, "text": "[29]", "ref_id": "BIBREF28"}, {"start": 890, "end": 894, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1108, "end": 1112, "text": "[30]", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}, {"start": 1341, "end": 1345, "text": "[31,", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 1346, "end": 1349, "text": "32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 1680, "end": 1684, "text": "[33,", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 1685, "end": 1688, "text": "34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 1695, "end": 1699, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 1710, "end": 1714, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 785, "end": 792, "text": "Table 1", "ref_id": "TABREF0"}], "section": "Virus-Encoded miRNAs"}, {"text": "The interactions between viral and cellular miRNAs in viral diseases and virusassociated cancers are complex [37] .

Another primary function of virus miRNAs is to regulate the latent-lytic switch. During latency, the host cell maintains the viral genome, and only a limited portion of virus genome is expressed. Viral gene expression is restricted, but virus miRNAs and their precursors are regularly detected [38] . There is an accumulating amount of evidence that has demonstrated that virus-encoded miRNAs mediate evolutionarily conserved functions (e.g., immune evasion, cell cycle control, promotion of latency, etc.) [5, [26] [27] [28] [37] [38] [39] . The miRNAs themselves show poorly primary sequence conservation [39] . These phenomena raise an important question: can viral miRNAs be used as the detection maker for virus infection during the latent infection phase despite the fact that little or no viral protein is being produced? Further studies are needed to evaluate this hypothesis.

These miRNAs are able to target sequences near the 3\u2032 portion of HIV-1 mRNA. This finding suggests that miRNAs may contribute to viral latency [45] . However, it is unclear whether these miRNAs are actively inhibited by viral factors or whether their deregulation is due to host responses. Host miRNAs expression profiles have been noted to represent specific pathophysiological states [24, 25] . Theoretically, a characteristic profile should be potential biomarkers for disease diagnosis and prognosis.

Along with highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses [56] , these respiratory viruses are notable due to their potential to cause pandemics [57] . The potential role of miR-NAs to diagnose these respiratory tract infections is under investigation. For example, the miRNA expression profile in bronchoalveolar stem cells (BASCs) infected with SARS coronavirus (CoV) has been determined using miRNA microarray [58] . A total of 116 miRNAs were found differentially expressed. Upregulated BASC miRNAs-17*, miRNAs-574-5p, and miRNAs-214 are co-opted by SARS-CoV to suppress its own replication and evade immune elimination until successful transmission takes place.

Adenovirus infections are associated with viral persistence and reactivation and continue to provide clinical challenges in terms of diagnosis and treatment. Adenoviruses express large amounts of noncoding virus-associated RNAs able to saturate key factors of the RNA interference processing pathway, including Exportin 5 and Dicer [63] . Moreover, a proportion of the noncoding virus-associated RNA is cleaved by Dicer in viral miRNAs. This cleaved RNA results in miRNAs that can saturate Argonaute, which is an essential protein for miRNA function that engages in transcriptional silencing processes in the nucleus [63, 64] . Therefore, processing and function of cellular miRNAs are blocked in cells infected by adenovirus [63] . Of note is that the cellular silencing machinery is active early after infection and can be used to control the adenovirus cell cycle [63] . It is also important to realize that miRNA expression has been found to fluctuate during the course of an adenovirus type 2 infection in human lung fibroblasts [65] . The miRNA expression profiles from adenovirus type 3 (AD3)-infected human laryngeal epithelial (Hep2) cells have been analyzed using a SOLiD deep sequencing [66] . A total of 44 miRNAs demonstrated high expression, and 36 miR-NAs showed lower expression in the AD3-infected cells than in control cells [66] . The role of miRNAs in adenovirus-infected cells is relevant because of the past and future use of recombinant adenoviruses as vectors for gene therapy [67] .

Therefore, Tm normalization of the full set of probes is absolutely required since the hybridization is usually carried out at one temperature. To solve this problem, two techniques, LNA utilization or adjusting the lengths of the probes, have been successfully used to normalize Tm value [127, 128] . Quantity of miRNA is also very important for miRNA microarray assay since the abundance of miRNAs in total RNA is very low and a relatively large amount of miRNA is needed in comparison to a RT-PCR assay.

Many methods have been developed to label miRNA, and these can be classified into two main categories: direct labeling and indirect labeling. Direct labeling with fluorescent dye can be accomplished enzymatically. Currently used methods include labeling through poly(A) polymerase, labeling through T4 RNA ligase, guanine labeling, and labeling microRNA through a RNA-primed arraybased Klenow enzyme assay (RAKE). Fluorescent dye also can conjugate with adjacent 3'-OH of mature miRNAs using a chemical reagent [129, 130] . Indirect labeling methods include labeling through miRNA reverse transcript, the RT-PCR product of miRNA, or the in vitro transcript of miRNA. The advantages of indirect labeling are obvious since the reverse transcription product of miRNAs is more stable and easy to preserve. In addition, miRNA can be amplified and labeled synchronously through PCR or in vitro transcription, which is very useful for lowabundance miRNAs. Although direct labeling is simple, this method has inherent problems including the fact that guanine labeling is not suitable for miRNAs lacking G residues, that T4 ligase labeling can introduce base bias, and that the procedure of chemical labeling is somewhat complicated.

Currently, three main platforms are in widespread use for miRNA profiling and discovery: the Roche (454) GS FLX sequencer, the Illumina Genome Analyzer, and the Applied Biosystems SOLiD sequencer. The methodologies of the NGS for miRNA analysis are similar and include sRNA isolation, library preparation, sequencing, and data analysis.

One disadvantage of NGS to comprehensively profile mRNA expression is that this technique is rather expensive compared to microarray though its cost has significantly decreased with the development of commercial platforms. Another limitation of NGS is that the read length is relatively short (35-500 bp) compared to traditional capillary sequencing (1000-1200 bp).

Northern blotting is very sensitive, but it is very time-consuming and not practical in large clinical studies for routine detection of the expression of hundreds of miRNAs. RT-qPCR is able to detect low copy numbers with high sensitivity and specificity. When studying the expression levels of multi-miRNAs simultaneously, microarray and sequencing may be the best choice.

The selection of endogenous control miRNAs is necessary to avoid false negative results due to a bad sample quality, but it is difficult. In this case a miRNA gene that is expected to be stably expressed in all analyzed samples should be selected as an endogenous control. Preferably target mRNA levels should be normalized using as miRNA normalizers control genes belonging to the same RNA class [139] . Based on the same concept, normalization of miRNA levels should be based on endogenous control genes that belong to the small noncoding RNA family (ncRNA) of RNAs, such as small nuclear RNAs (snRNA). It is important to note that the endogenous miRNAs should meet the following characteristics in order to be used as miRNA normalizer: (a) the miRNA normalizer should be highly expressed in most samples, (b) the miRNA normalizer should show invariable expression across the test sample, and (c) the miRNA normalizer should have equivalent extraction and quantification efficiency with the target miRNAs. In order to avoid misinterpreted data and to identify true changes in miRNA expression levels, it is important to select the correct endogenous miRNA normalizer. Different algorithms can be used to select the best endogenous miRNA normalizer including geNorm [140] , NormFinder [141] , and BestKeeper [142] . In most cases reported so far, researchers select their endogenous reference genes for miRNA quantification according to reports in the literature or based on distinguishable low standard deviations (SD) in miRNA microarrays data.

Therefore, in each case different miRNA normalizers should be first evaluated and then established for different sample types.

For example, serum miR-223 could serve as a potential new biomarker for the detection of schistosome infection and the assessment of the response to chemotherapy.

Studies on host miRNA profiles for microbial infections are underway. Host miRNA profiles have a considerable way to go before they will be ready for use in clinical practice. Several issues remain to be clarified in this field: (A) source material should be fixed. Plasma, serum, whole blood, and isolated exosomes or microvesicles have been used as the source for miRNA profiling. Advantages and disadvantages of each source should be considered prior to selecting the source. (B) Though differences in circulating miRNAs between males and females have not been found with the exception of differences associated with pregnancy [240, 241] , miRNA levels in plasma, and serum from a large number of normal individuals of both genders and various ages, even the same individual over time should be extensively studied. (C) No acknowledged reference genes have been found in serum/plasma. Commonly used endogenous controls, such as miR-16, are dysregulated in some diseases; RNU6B is degraded in serum. Spiking into RNA isolation processes with synthetic exogenous miRNA only acts as a normalizers for differences in recovery between samples. (D) The methods of miRNA quantification including RNA isolation should be standardized since inter-platform reproducibility among different platforms is low.
