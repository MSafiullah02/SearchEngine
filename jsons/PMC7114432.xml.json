            "text": "Porcine circovirus (PCV) type 2 (PCV2) was initially recognized in 1998 (Allan et al., 1998, Meehan et al., 1998, Morozov et al., 1998) but based on retrospective molecular and serological investigations it is now known to have been present in the global pig population many decades prior to its discovery (Jacobsen et al., 2009). PCV2 is a small, single-stranded, ambisense DNA virus (Tischer et al., 1974, Tischer et al., 1982) that belongs to the genus Circovirus in the family Circoviridae (Todd et al., 2005). PCVs contain two major open reading frames (ORFs) oriented in opposite directions which encode for proteins associated with replication (ORF1) and the virus capsid (ORF2) (Mankertz et al., 1998, Nawagitgul et al., 2000). Recent phylogenic investigations indicate that PCV2 can be further subdivided into several types of which PCV2a and PCV2b are highly prevalent in the pig population and are present worldwide (Cheung et al., 2007, Segal\u00e9s et al., 2008). The various clinical manifestations of PCV2 infection in pigs across age groups have been summarized as \u201cporcine circovirus disease\u201d (PCVD) in Europe (Segal\u00e9s et al., 2005) and as \u201cporcine circovirus associated disease\u201d (PCVAD) in North America (Opriessnig et al., 2007). PCVAD includes systemic disease characterized by wasting and growth retardation and better known as postweaning multisystemic wasting syndrome or PMWS (Harding and Clark, 1997), respiratory disease often with other respiratory pathogens as part of the porcine respiratory disease complex or PRDC (Harms et al., 2002), enteric disease characterized by diarrhea in grow-finish pigs (Jensen et al., 2006), reproductive disease associated with small litter sizes and increased numbers of stillborn and mummified fetuses (Madson and Opriessnig, 2011), and porcine dermatitis and nephropathy syndrome or PDNS (Rosell et al., 2000). To the authors\u2019 knowledge, PDNS is the one PCV2-associated clinical manifestation that has never been experimentally reproduced. It has been suggested that the underlying pathogenic mechanism for development of PDNS is a rapid-onset of systemic coagulation that could be induced by any number of combinations of endotheliotropic pathogens or toxins with or without PCV2 (Krakowka et al., 2008).",

            "text": "Several studies have demonstrated that PCV2 is the primary and essential etiological agent in the pathogenesis of PCVAD (Bolin et al., 2001, Ellis et al., 1999, Ladekj\u00e6r-Mikkelsen et al., 2002). However, experimentally, PCVAD is reproduced most efficiently and consistently when PCV2 inoculation is done in conjunction with other swine pathogens. Several of these PCV2-co-infection models have evolved to nicely mimic what is observed in the field (Allan et al., 1999, Allan et al., 2000a, Ellis et al., 2008, Harms et al., 2001, Jung et al., 2006b, Kennedy et al., 2000, Kim et al., 2003, Krakowka et al., 2000, Opriessnig et al., 2004a, Opriessnig et al., 2004b, Opriessnig et al., 2008, Opriessnig et al., 2009, Opriessnig et al., 2011a, Opriessnig et al., 2011b, Opriessnig et al., 2011c, Rovira et al., 2002, Shen et al., 2010, Sinha et al., 2011) and these models have allowed the body of knowledge on the pathogenesis of PCV2 to continue to advance. It is well known that PCV2 has a tropism for lymphoid tissues where it accumulates in large numbers in the cytoplasm of macrophages in depleted lymphoid follicles (Sorden, 2000). PCV2 is one of the smallest viruses known to mankind (Todd et al., 2005) and lacks its own enzymes so viral DNA intermediates are generated in host cell nuclei and they depend on host cell enzymes present in the synthesis (S) phase of the cell cycle for completion of the replication cycle (Tischer et al., 1987). Virions are assembled in both nuclei and cytoplasm and released from infected cells in the absence of viral cytopathic effects in vitro (Allan and Ellis, 2000).",

A retrospective analysis of 484 systemic PCVAD cases collected in the Midwestern United States between 2000 and 2001 revealed that singular PCV2 infection was found in only 1.9% (9/484) of the cases investigated (Pallar\u00e9s et al., 2002). Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) was detected in 51.9% (251/484) of the cases, the combination PCV2 and Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae (M. hyopneumoniae) was found in 35.5% (172/484) of the cases, and both PCV2 and swine influenza virus (SIV) were detected in 5.4% (26/484) of the PCVAD cases (Pallar\u00e9s et al., 2002). A similar study conducted in 2009 and involving 200 systemic PCVAD cases collected in the same region as in the 2000/2001 study revealed the following: PRRSV was detected in 60.0% (120/200) of the cases (Fig. 2\nA), the combination of PCV2 and M. hyopneumoniae was found in 15.5% (31/200) of the cases (Fig. 3\nA), and both PCV2 and SIV were detected in 13.0% (26/200) of the PCVAD cases (Opriessnig, unpublished data). The main difference between the data obtained in 2000/2001 and those obtained in 2009 was a higher percentage of cases without concurrent pathogen detection and increased isolation of common secondary bacterial invaders such as Arcanobacterium pyogenes (Fig. 4\n).",

Similar to PCV2, PPV has a strong cellular tropism for mitotically active tissues like lymph nodes or heart muscle (Allan and Ellis, 2000, Oraveerakul et al., 1993). Based on pathogenicity and tissue tropism, PPV-isolates have been classified as non-pathogenic (Cutlip and Mengeling, 1975, Paul and Mengeling, 1980), pathogenic to non-immunocompetent fetuses leading to death (Mengeling, 1979), pathogenic to immunocompetent fetuses and inducing dermatitis (Choi et al., 1987, Kresse et al., 1985, Lager and Mengeling, 1994, Lager et al., 1992), or enteric (Dea et al., 1985, Duhamel et al., 1991). While incoming gilts, and less often sows, are routinely vaccinated to protect against PPV-associated reproductive losses, infection of growing pigs with PPV is typically not associated with clinical disease (Allan et al., 1999, Brown et al., 1980, Kennedy et al., 2000, Krakowka et al., 2000, Opriessnig et al., 2004a) and producers rarely monitor for or implement control strategies for PPV in growing pigs.",

PPV and PCV2 co-infection was demonstrated in 17.4% (12/69) of pigs with naturally acquired PCVAD. In contrast, there was no evidence of the presence of PCV2 DNA in age-matched control animals suffering from Streptococcus suis infection (Ellis et al., 2000). This study provided important early evidence that PPV is likely a significant co-factor in PCVAD under field conditions. In further support of the importance of PPV in PCVAD, PPV DNA was demonstrated by in situ hybridization in 25.6% (34/133) of Korean PCVAD cases (Kim et al., 2002). When 142 skin sections obtained from pigs diagnosed with exudative epidermitis were further investigated, PCV2 alone, PPV alone, or concurrent PCV2 and PPV infection were demonstrated in 8.5% (12/142), 11.3% (16/142) and 42.3% (60/142) of the tissues, respectively (Kim and Chae, 2004). Distinct positive PCV2 and PPV labeling was found throughout the inflammatory areas in the dermoepidermal junction, the superficial dermis, and occasionally in macrophages in lymphoid tissues further emphasizing the high prevalence of concurrent PCV2 and PPV infection in growing pigs, especially in pigs with exudative epidermitis (Kim and Chae, 2004).",

The investigators were able to reproduce most of the lesions typical of systemic PCVAD in gnotobiotic pigs inoculated with filtered cell culture material and filtered lymphoid tissues from pigs with naturally acquired disease. Both, PCV2 and PPV and antibodies to these viruses were detected in the experimentally-inoculated pigs (Ellis et al., 1999). Several groups have since demonstrated that pigs dually-inoculated with PCV2 and PPV develop more severe disease and lesions than pigs infected with PCV2 alone (Allan et al., 1999, Hasslung et al., 2005, Kennedy et al., 2000, Kim et al., 2003, Kim et al., 2006, Opriessnig et al., 2004a, Ostanello et al., 2005). Interestingly, PCV2 potentiation by PPV appears to be independent of sequence of infection. When piglets born to sows exposed to PCV2 21 days before the expected farrowing date were infected with PPV intranasally at 4 weeks of age, they developed microscopic lesions consistent with PCVAD and very similar to the lesions in pigs with concurrent PPV\u2013PCV2 inoculation at 4 weeks of age further highlighting the complex interaction of these two small DNA viruses (Ha et al., 2008).",

Early on, it was suggested that PPV-induced immune dysfunction promotes enhanced replication of PCV2 (Allan et al., 1999). In support of this, it was demonstrated that PPV replication occurred prior to PCV2 replication. In co-infected pigs, PPV antigen predominated in the tissues between 3 and 14 days post inoculation (dpi) with a maximum antigen load observed between 6 and 14 dpi whereas PCV2 antigen was first observed in minimal amounts in mesenteric lymph nodes at 10 dpi with increasing intensity and distribution of PCV2 antigen at 14, 17, 21, and 26 dpi (Allan et al., 2000b).",

Three-week-old conventional pigs confirmed to have passively acquired antibodies to PPV and PCV2 were co-infected with PPV and PCV2 and half of the pigs (4/8) were vaccinated with a commercial Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae vaccine at 3 dpi. Although PCV2 viremia was detected, none of the pigs developed clinical disease through termination of the study at 42 dpi indicating that the pigs with passively-derived immunity became PCV2 infected but remained subclinical (Ostanello et al., 2005).",

In 2009, a novel porcine boca-like virus (Pbo-likeV) was identified in lymph nodes obtained from two Swedish pigs suffering from systemic PCVAD using random multiple displacement amplification and large-scale sequencing (Blomstr\u00f6m et al., 2009). Following the identification of Pbo-likeV in lymphoid tissues, additional samples from a healthy and a clinically affected pig were characterized and Pbo-likeV was identified in the PCVAD pig but not in the non-PCVAD pig (Blomstr\u00f6m et al., 2009). In a follow-up study, 34 PCVAD and 24 non-PCVAD pigs were screened by PCR for the presence of PCV2, torque teno sus virus species 1 (TTSuV1) and 2 (TTSuV2), and Pbo-likeV (Blomstr\u00f6m et al., 2010). The prevalence of these viruses in affected animals was 100% for PCV2, 77% for TTSuV-1, 94% for TTSuV-2, and 88% for Pbo-likeV. In non-PCVAD pigs the detection rates were as follows: 80% for PCV2, 79% for TTSuV1, 83% for TTSuV2, and 46% for Pbo-likeV leading to the conclusion that polyviral infections are common in PCVAD pigs and the synergistic effect of concurrent viral infection could contribute to expression of clinical disease (Blomstr\u00f6m et al., 2010). Recently, a novel PPV, PPV4, was identified in the lung lavage of a diseased pig co-infected with PCV2 in the United States (Cheung et al., 2010). The importance of this finding is unknown at this point in time.",

PRRSV was implicated very early as being important in the pathogenesis of PCVAD. Not surprisingly, several field studies conducted in Spain (Grau-Roma and Segal\u00e9s, 2007, Segal\u00e9s et al., 2002), the United States (Dorr et al., 2007, Pallar\u00e9s et al., 2002, Pogranichniy et al., 2002), the Netherlands (Wellenberg et al., 2004), Canada (Drolet et al., 2003), and Italy (Morandi et al., 2010) confirmed the interaction of PRRSV and PCV2. For example, a case-control study in the Netherlands, which included 60 clinically affected pigs and 180 pigs without clinical signs, identified combined PCV2 and PRRSV infection in 83% of the clinically-affected pigs and in 35% of the pigs from PCVAD-free herds (Wellenberg et al., 2004). A case-control study in the United States, which included 31 pigs with a clinical history of wasting and microscopic lesions characteristic of PCVAD and 56 control pigs without PCVAD, revealed that among 10 viruses tested, PCV2 had the strongest association with PCVAD, but the risk for clinical PCVAD was much higher if the pig was concurrently infected with PRRSV (Pogranichniy et al., 2002). Moreover, when proliferative and necrotizing pneumonia cases were tested, concurrent PRRSV and PCV2 infection was confirmed in 40.5% (30/74) of cases in Spain (Grau-Roma and Segal\u00e9s, 2007), in 41.7% (25/60) in cases in Canada (Drolet et al., 2003) and in 28.6% (8/28) of cases in Italy (Morandi et al., 2010).",

However, the replication and distribution of PRRSV in concurrently infected pigs was not enhanced compared to that of pigs infected singularly with PRRSV (Allan et al., 2000a). To further investigate the high prevalence of combined PRRSV and PCV2 infection in the United States (Harms et al., 2002), cesarean-derived colostrum-deprived (CDCD) pigs were co-infected with PCV2 and PRRSV at 3 weeks of age. It was demonstrated that combined PRRSV and PCV2 infection substantially increased the severity of clinical disease and lesions (Harms et al., 2001). Similarly, when conventional pigs were inoculated with PRRSV at 5 weeks of age and seven days later with PCV2, 14.3% (1/7) of the co-infected pigs died after developing wasting and respiratory disease, and PCV2 DNA was found in higher amounts in co-infected pigs compared to pigs infected with PCV2 alone, confirming that PRRSV infection enhances PCV2 replication (Rovira et al., 2002).",

Pigs inoculated with PRRSV only and those co-infected with PRRSV and PCV2 developed moderate-to-severe clinical disease (Fig. 1B) characterized by high and persistent fevers, sneezing, decreased weight gain, and lethargy. By 14 dpi, macroscopically the lungs failed to collapse, were congested and had diffuse and severe mottled-tan areas of consolidation (Fig. 2B). Microscopic lesions in the PCV2\u2013PRRSV co-infected group were characterized by severe lymphoid depletion of lymphoid follicles, moderate-to-severe bronchointerstitial pneumonia, and moderate-to-severe perivascular lymphohistiocytic cuffing in brain tissues which was not observed in singularly-PCV2 or singularly-PRRSV inoculated pigs (Opriessnig, unpublished observation). Besides being upregulated by PRRSV when administered around the same time or after PRRSV infection, initial PCV2 infection prior to PRRSV vaccination has previously shown to have a negative impact on PRRSV vaccine efficacy. Subclinical infection of pigs with PCV2 14 days before vaccination with a modified-live PRRSV vaccine resulted in significantly more severe PRRSV-induced macroscopic lung lesions after PRRSV challenge (Opriessnig et al., 2006). Evidence of interaction of PCV2 with the attenuated vaccine strain of PRRSV was lacking in that study.",

In a co-infection study using pulmonary alveolar macrophages, which are the target cells for PRRSV in vivo, PCV2-induced interferon (IFN) \u03b1, a type I interferon which mainly acts by activating natural killer cells, reduced PRRSV infection and the PRRSV-associated cytopathic effect (Chang et al., 2005). In another in vitro study, pulmonary alveolar macrophages were infected singularly or with combinations of PCV2b, PCV2a, chimeric PCV2aORF1\u20132bORF2 (ORF1 from PCV2a and ORF2 from PCV2b), and chimeric PCV2bORF1\u20132aORF2 (ORF1 from PCV2b and ORF2 from PCV2a) and one of five PRRSV isolates (Lin et al., 2011. In vitro interaction of PRRSV and PCV2. In: 50th Ann. North Central Conf. Vet. Lab. Diagn., Brookings, South Dakota, p. 21). PCV2 replication, which was measured by detection of spliced PCV2 mRNA, was observed in all groups after 24 h; however, after 48 h, it was limited to groups inoculated with PCV2 strains containing ORF1 of PCV2a (PCV2a, chimeric PCV2aORF1\u20132bORF2) concurrently infected with PRRSV (Lin et al., 2011. In vitro interaction of PRRSV and PCV2. In: 50th Ann. North Central Conf. Vet. Lab. Diagn., Brookings, South Dakota, p. 21) implying that the PRRSV isolates used in the study provided some selective replication advantage on certain PCV2a isolates. Combined PCV2\u2013PRRSV infection and the expression of Fas and Fas ligand (FasL), a type-II transmembrane protein that belongs to the TNF family and induces apoptosis after binding with its receptor, was investigated on the surface of splenic lymphocytes, macrophages, and peripheral blood lymphocytes (Chang et al., 2007). Splenic lymphocytes and macrophages in the dually infected group displayed a significantly higher amount of Fas and FasL expression on the cell surfaces compared to the group singularly infected with PCV2. Therefore, the investigators believe it seems reasonable that lymphocyte depletion in vivo is in part the result of apoptosis due to increased Fas and FasL expression (Chang et al., 2007).",

In a field study conducted in Spain, a significantly higher prevalence of TTSuV DNA was found in sera from PCVAD-affected animals (97%) than in sera from non-PCVAD-affected animals (78%) (Kekarainen et al., 2006). Overall, this indicated a high prevalence of both TTSuV species with a higher frequency in clinically affected animals than in clinically normal animals and with an apparent association between PCVAD and TTSuV2 (Kekarainen et al., 2006). These findings were further confirmed by a different Spanish study which found that TTSuV2 viral loads were significantly higher in PCVAD pigs; however, TTSuV1 prevalence and loads were not related with PCVAD (Aramouni et al., 2011). In contrast, in a Swedish study TTSuV DNA of both species was identified in tissues from clinically affected PCVAD pigs but also in tissues from a pig not suffering from PCVAD without differences between groups (Blomstr\u00f6m et al., 2009). In support of the Swedish findings, similar amounts of TTSuV DNA were identified in PCVAD and non-PCVAD pigs in Korea suggesting that TTSuV may not exacerbate PCVAD in all instances (Lee et al., 2010).",

PEDV can induce severe acute enteritis in pigs of all ages and PEDV infection is often fatal in neonatal piglets (Kim and Chae, 2000, Pensaert and de Bouck, 1978). Korean pigs naturally infected with PEDV were recently investigated for presence of PCV2 (Jung et al., 2006a). Among 107 small intestinal samples, PCV2 DNA was identified in 32.7% (35/107) and PCV2 antigen was found in 29.9% (32/107). Since most of the pigs in that study were less than three days old, prenatal in utero PCV2 infection was suspected (Jung et al., 2006a). To further confirm the possible link between PEDV and PCV2, six pregnant sows were randomly allocated to an infected or a control group and three pregnant sows were inoculated intranasally with PCV2 three weeks before the expected farrowing date (Jung et al., 2006b). Thirty piglets from the PCV2-infected sows and negative control sows were randomly assigned to two groups of 15 piglets each, respectively. The piglets in two of the groups, derived from PCV2-infected or negative control sows, were inoculated orally at 3 days of age with PEDV. In PEDV-infected piglets derived from PCV2-infected sows, significantly more PEDV RNA was detected in the jejunal tissues at 24 h after PEDV inoculation than in PEDV-infected piglets from PCV2 negative sows (Jung et al., 2006b). This is highly suggestive of an influence of transplacental PCV2 infection on PEDV and possibly also on other neonatal viral infections.",

There is field evidence indicating that SIV and PCV2 act synergistically in pigs with PRDC and both, PCV2 and SIV, can be identified frequently in the same pig under field conditions (Dorr et al., 2007, Harms et al., 2002, Pallar\u00e9s et al., 2002). Despite the available field evidence supporting an interaction between these viruses, it has been shown recently that SIV did not influence PCV2 replication in experimentally infected CDCD pigs (Wei et al., 2010). In this study, the pigs were inoculated intratracheally with cell culture medium only, PCV2 alone, or PCV2 followed by SIV H1N1 infection one week later. Co-infection with SIV did not increase the severity of clinical disease or gross or microscopic lesions associated with PCV2 in lungs or lymph nodes (Wei et al., 2010).",

Microscopically, the hallmark lesion associated with M. hyopneumoniae is hyperplasia of the bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (Kwon et al., 2002, Sarradell et al., 2003; Fig. 5\nA). Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae colonizes the luminal surface of bronchial and bronchiolar epithelial cells (Fig. 5C) without invading epithelial cells (Kwon et al., 2002, Sarradell et al., 2003). Typically, PCV2 antigen in dual-infected pigs can be readily demonstrated in these areas (Fig. 5B). The immune response induced by M. hyopneumoniae is complex with reports of both immunostimulation and immunosuppression (Kishima and Ross, 1985, Maes et al., 1996, Messier and Ross, 1991), non-specific mitogenic effects on swine lymphocytes (Messier and Ross, 1991), and alteration in cytokine profiles secreted by activated macrophages (Asai et al., 1993, Asai et al., 1994, Thacker et al., 2000, Thanawongnuwech et al., 2001). In a recent field investigation involving 147 pig farms across England, one of the identified factors associated with increased PCVAD severity was seropositivity to M. hyopneumoniae (Alarcon et al., 2011).",

When boars were challenged with M. hyopneumoniae and PCV2 using an interval of two weeks between inoculations, severe clinical disease was observed in co-infected boars, which was further accompanied by shedding of high levels of PCV2 DNA in semen posing a potential risk for PCV2 infection in downstream breeding herds (Opriessnig et al., 2011b). Overall, these studies documented that M. hyopneumoniae potentiates the severity of PCV2-associated lung and lymphoid lesions by increasing the amount and prolonging the presence of PCV2-antigen thereby increasing the incidence of clinical disease in pigs.",

Clinically, pigs affected by ileitis commonly range from 6 to 20 weeks of age and display diarrhea and decreased growth rates. Initially, PCV2 was indentified in cases of granulomatous enteritis in Iberian pigs naturally infected with both, PCV2 and L. intracellularis (Segal\u00e9s et al., 2001). In a Danish investigation involving tissues from 64 pigs with enteritis of varying intensity, 53.1% (34/64) were infected with both PCV2 and L. intracellularis whereas the remaining 46.9% (30/64) were infected with PCV2 alone (Jensen et al., 2006). To confirm a possible relationship between these two pathogens, conventional pigs were inoculated with PCV2, L. intracellularis, or both under experimental conditions (Opriessnig et al., 2011a). Individual pigs inoculated with PCV2 regardless of co-infection status developed severe PCVAD characterized clinically by weight loss and microscopically by PCV2-antigen associated severe lymphoid depletion and histiocytic replacement of the majority of lymphoid tissues (Opriessnig et al., 2011a). This is indicative that L. intracellularis does not enhance PCVAD and that co-infection of pigs is likely an incidental finding.",

For example, it is possible that new DNA synthesis, mitosis and PPV-induced proliferation of histiocytes and macrophages, cell types in which PCV2 antigen can be identified frequently (Sorden, 2000), provide ideal conditions for PCV2 replication and dissemination (Kim et al., 2003).

Increase of IFN-\u03b3 levels in pulmonary alveolar macrophages and bronchial lavage fluid is a common response to swine respiratory pathogens such as PRRSV and M. hyopneumoniae infection (Thanawongnuwech and Thacker, 2003). Recently, cytokine and chemokine mRNA expression profiles were determined in tracheobronchial lymph nodes from 28 pigs singularly infected with PCV2, M. hyopneumoniae, or dual-infected (Zhang et al., 2011a, Zhang et al., 2011b). Overall, M. hyopneumoniae potentiated PCV2 infection by increasing IFN-\u03b3 and IL-10 mRNA expression levels. The increase of IFN-\u03b3 and chemokines, and decrease of IFN-\u03b1 in pigs singularly infected with PCV2 or dual-infected was correlated with increased severity of lymphoid lesions and presence of PCV2 antigen. This likely provides evidence that increased severity of lesions in dual-infected pigs was associated with presence of PCV2 antigen and alterations of cytokine mRNA expression profiles (Zhang et al., 2011a, Zhang et al., 2011b).",

Under cell-culture conditions, concurrent PCV2\u2013PPV infection has been shown to decrease the ability of porcine pulmonary macrophages to phagocytose (Liu et al., 2011). Excessive production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, a cytokine that is involved in systemic inflammation and acute phase reactions, in response to PPV has been implicated as a potential contributor to PCVAD (Kim et al., 2006). An in vitro assay for TNF-\u03b1, conducted on alveolar macrophages obtained from pigs co-infected with PCV2 and PPV, showed a significant increase in TNF-\u03b1 compared to macrophages infected alone with either PCV2 or PPV (Kim et al., 2006). In experimental models, all pigs inoculated with PPV alone or in combination with PCV2, displayed IL-10 responses in serum while only pigs infected with PPV in combination with PCV2 showed TNF-\u03b1 in serum on repeated occasions (Hasslung et al., 2005). As IFN-\u03b3 production was reduced in this model, induction of TNF-\u03b1 secretion by PPV (Kim et al., 2006) could promote the high levels of PCV2 typically seen with this particular co-infection.",

The exact mechanisms of this phenomenon are unknown thus far, but PRRSV-induced immunosuppression and immune response modifications have been shown to play a role in the pathogenicity of other respiratory viruses (Jung et al., 2009) and may contribute similarly to PCV2 pathogenesis. The observations of reduction of a PRRSV-associated cytopathic effect in vitro in cells co-infected with PCV2 and PRRSV (Chang et al., 2005) and increased de novo expression and production of Fas ligand thereby increasing apoptosis (Chang et al., 2007) may also be applicable in vivo and may contribute to accelerated and prolonged disease commonly observed in PRRSV\u2013PCV2 co-infected pigs.",

            "text": "It was found that the origin of replication of PCV2 genome contains an interferon-stimulated response element (ISRE)-like sequence (CTTCTTTCGTTTTCAGCT) (Mankertz et al., 2004). To assess the role of ISRE in PCV2 pathogenesis during co-infection, an ISRE-mutant PCV2 was constructed and used to experimentally infect pigs singularly or in combination PRRSV (Ramamoorthy et al., 2011). It was determined that mutation of the PCV2 ISRE caused an apparent increase of virulence in pigs co-infected with PCV2 and PRRSV at 14 dpi. The authors speculated that in the context of co-infections, IFN-\u03b3 induced transcription factors were unable to bind to the ISRE mutant, thus resulting in increased replication or, alternatively, that IFN-\u03b3 played a protective role during the early stages of PCV2\u2013PRRSV co-infection (Ramamoorthy et al., 2011). To further investigate the role of PRRSV on PCV2, the PCV2 genomes recovered from clinically affected PCV2\u2013PRRSV co-infected pigs were sequenced and compared (Yi and Liu, 2010) indicating that PCV2 ORF1 is highly conserved with only four polymorphic sites. In contrast, polymorphic sites were clustered in the capsid protein, and overlapped with the immunoreactive epitopes (Yi and Liu, 2010). Although in general, this approach could give some useful hints on differences in disease expression among pigs, unfortunately, PCV2 genomes from non-PRRSV infected pigs were not included so the importance of this finding and the role of PRRSV remain undetermined.",

Several experimental models capable of reproducing clinical PCVAD are now available. Comparison of outcomes between experiments is somewhat challenging as this work has been done by several groups across the world using different PCV2 isolates, different virus inocula doses, different routes of inoculation, different pig types (gnotobiotic, CDCD, CD, SPF, conventional) and ages, different sequences of infection and different co-infecting agents. However, based on this growing body of evidence from the field and research community it is clear that PCV2 infection can be upregulated and PCVAD can be enhanced by concurrent infection with a variety of pathogens. Moreover, in most controlled experiments, concurrent infection increased levels of PCV2 while the opposite, upregulation of the concurrent pathogen, was an inconsistent finding.",
