            "text": "Coronaviruses (CoVs) are known to be one of the major respiratory pathogens that cause a range of diseases in both human and animal communities. Some have led to concerns for a threat to global public health in the twenty-first century, such as the CoVs causing severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (Zhong et al. 2003) and those responsible for the recently identified Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) (Zaki et al. 2012). For CoVs in avian species, avian coronaviruses (ACoVs) are classified into the genus Gammacoronavirus. The infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is among the most important ACoVs affecting the poultry industry. IBV was first reported as an avian respiratory pathogen in the 1930s in Massachusetts, USA. It exhibits extensive antigenic variation, and the strains present in each country are almost unique. Therefore, many genotypes of IBV have been identified worldwide, and new variants keep emerging despite vaccination (reviewed in de Wit et al. 2011; Jackwood 2012). Vaccines against IBVs are generally effective, but new strains continue to emerge causing clinical diseases and production problems in vaccinated flocks, eventually having an economic impact on the global poultry industry (Gelb et al. 2005; Liu et al. 2006a, 2006b; Han et al. 2011). The pathogenicity of IBV is very complex as it is influenced by many factors, such as the strain of the virus, the breed of chicken, environmental conditions, and concurrent infection from other pathogens. IBV alone may not cause severe and devastating disease, but IBV-infected birds can be susceptible to superinfection by bacteria (for example, Escherichia coli), mycoplasma (for example, Mycoplasma gallisepticum, M. synoviae) and co-infection with other viruses such as the infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV), Newcastle disease virus (NDV), avian influenza virus (AIV), and Marek's disease virus (MDV) (Bradbury 1984; Matthijs et al. 2003; Cavanagh & Gelb 2008; Dwars et al. 2009).",

Its genome encodes four structural proteins: phosphorylated nucleocapsid protein (N), membrane glycoprotein (M), spike glycoprotein (S), and small envelope protein (E) (Cavanagh 2007). The spike glycoprotein S, in the form of club-shaped projections present on the surface of the virus, is post-translationally cleavable into two subunits: the S1 forming the outer spike portion of the protein and the S2, the protein anchoring it to the viral envelope. The S1 is responsible for attachment to the host cell receptors, while the S2 subunit mediates fusion of the virus and the host cell membrane, thereby entering into the host cells. Moreover, the S1 subunit contains epitopes and determinants for serotype-specificity, hemagglutinin activity, and for neutralizing antibodies that provide protective immunity (Masters 2006; Cavanagh & Gelb 2008).",

Currently, genotypes based on the sequence of the S1 protein gene, especially in the hypervariable 5\u2032 region (HVR), are used for classification of IBVs. This genotyping is very useful in the continuous determination of the epidemic genotype of IBV field strains, and for predicting the effectiveness of vaccines against field isolates. In addition, the production of a new generation of vaccines, genetically related to the circulating IBV local strains, is economically beneficial for control of infectious bronchitis (IB) in global geographic regions.",

            "text": "In China, IBVs were isolated and identified in the early 1980s. Since that time, IB outbreaks have been ongoing in both vaccinated and non-vaccinated flocks, and have had an economic impact. Vaccines, usually based on a Massachusetts (Mass, M41), a Connecticut (Conn), and a 4/91 strain, have been used extensively in poultry farms for many years. However, these vaccines provided very little protection against Chinese isolates. This is because vaccines and field strains belong to different phylogenetic clusters that have larger evolutionary distances, indicating different genotypes (Liu et al. 2006a, 2006b; Han et al. 2011; Li et al. 2012; Ma et al. 2012). The obvious signs of IB in vaccinated commercial broilers were respiratory symptoms. Post-mortem findings indicated inflammation of the upper respiratory tract, the kidneys, and the proventriculus. There was a broad range of debilitating symptoms while mortality sometimes occurred when co-infection was present. The most prevalent signs in layer hens included decreased egg production, deformed eggs, and increased mortality. A nephropathogenic LX4 type, one among the predominant Chinese variants, was purported to have originated in China in the mid-1980s. Importantly, a predominant QX-IBV, a new IBV variant that was classified within the LX4 group, was reported (Yudong et al. 1998) and spread extensively to other regions in China and also to other countries (reviewed in de Wit et al. 2011; Jackwood 2012; Ma et al. 2012). This type of IBV caused severe nephritis, proventricultis, and atrophic oviducts, which resulted in a decrease in egg production (Yudong et al. 1998). In previous years, outbreaks of many IBV strains, such as the Mass-type associated nephropathogenic strains, were reported in China. Nevertheless, other strains with a partial relationship to the Mass-type were also identified (Li & Yang 2001; Yu et al. 2001; Liu & Kong 2004; Bing et al. 2007). In addition, virus isolation between 1995 and 2004 indicated that at least seven genotypes were detected, mainly being nephropathogenic strains. However, a number of genotypes were not only indigenous to China, but some had a genetic relationship to those isolated from neighboring countries, for example, Korea and Taiwan (Liu et al. 2006a, 2006b). Also the major groups of the more recently isolated IBVs belonged to the Chinese types, which differed from both the vaccine and the non-Chinese strains (Yan et al. 2011). Therefore, different IBV strains have been increasingly co-circulating in the poultry population.",

            "text": "The geographic distribution of IBVs indicated a wide variety of IBV types present in China. For instance, in southern China, the dominant signs of IB were associated with respiratory distress and nephritis in chickens of different age groups. Some isolates were classified into Taiwanese-type (TW-I), Mass-type, and proventriculitis-type viruses (Li et al. 2010; Zou et al. 2010; Yan et al. 2011; Li et al. 2013). In addition, IBVs isolated from broilers and broiler breeders at various ages from eastern, southern, south-western, and central parts of China were classified into different genetic groups. These flocks exhibited typical respiratory and nephropathogenic IB symptoms, and experienced pathological changes. Nephropathogenic IBVs were mainly A2-like (QX-IBV) strains, and they showed evolutionary distance from vaccine strains. Among others, HN08, 4/91, Gray, and Mass-types were also identified. Moreover, recombination events were observed between a LX4 and a teal-isolate (tl/CH/LDT3/03I-type), contributing to the emergence of a new variant. Interestingly, a recent Taiwanese-type (TW-II) was also detected in Mainland China. Corresponding investigations were presented, indicating that the Chinese strains had also been isolated in Taiwan (Han et al. 2011; Ji et al. 2011; Li et al. 2012; Luo et al. 2012; Ma et al. 2012; Li et al. 2013). Predominantly nephropathogenic LX4-type IBVs had apparently replaced the previously prevalent IBVs in China (Li et al. 2013). Recently, the divergence of new IBV variants that could be further classified was also demonstrated. For instance, IBV isolates in Cluster I and Cluster II had dissimilar amino acid sequences at a different position in the S1 subunit (Ma et al. 2012). Moreover, a GX-NN09032 isolate was associated with a recombination found in four IBV strains (He et al. 2012), while YN-type IBV was genetically similar to most of the prevalent Chinese strains but displayed more severe pathogenicity than the previously reported IBVs (Feng et al. 2012). Another example showed that a CK/CH/LSL/99I-type isolate was recently predominant in southern China. The S1 gene of this isolate had the greatest diversity. Positive selections were detected, not only in the S1 gene but also in the M and N genes. Recombination with vaccine strains, in particular a 4/91-type, was also detected (Mo et al. 2013). Therefore, the trend of IBV local strains isolated in different Chinese regions continually changes as novel variants are discovered. Consecutive investigations over a 15-year period have so far identified at least nine genetic types and, according to sequence and phylogenetic analyses of the S1 gene (Table 1), a couple of IBV variants currently found in China.",

            "text": "The first IBV (TP/64) appeared in Taiwan in 1965, and was isolated from layers that suffered from respiratory distress and a drop in egg production (Tseng et al. 1996). IB outbreaks occurred frequently even though a vaccination program was widely used. The most common vaccine used in Taiwan was based on a Mass-type. The S1 phylogeny of the Taiwanese isolates demonstrated the following groups: a Taiwanese Group I (TW-I), a Taiwanese Group II (TW-II), a Chinese-type, and a Mass-type. For the indigenous groups, the first Taiwanese isolate was classified as TW-II. However, according to the results of recent studies, most of these isolates belonged to TW-I. In addition, some of the remaining isolates appeared to be vaccine strains, including a Mass-type IBV field strain and one belonging to a Chinese J2 strain. The existence of Chinese IBV in Taiwan was unusual because of the prohibited importation of poultry products between Taiwan and Mainland China (Huang et al. 2004). Later, Huang and Wang (2006) developed attenuated vaccines derived from Taiwanese IBVs by the passage of the viruses in embryonated eggs. Thereafter, they demonstrated that the attenuation of these IBVs resulted in substitutions between two and six amino acids found in the S1 gene, and a few amino acid substitutions found in the S2 subunit (Huang & Wang 2007). This indicated that the S1 gene had undergone a high degree of mutation. Furthermore, Chen et al. (2009) studied the evidence of an IBV isolated in 2002, which demonstrated that the recombinants of Taiwanese IBVs had chimeric IBV genome arrangements originating from parental strains similar to those of Taiwan and China. Chen et al. (2010) further indicated that one isolate showed evidence of frequent recombination with the China-like strain in the S gene. Another isolate demonstrated the genome organization of the China-like strain in the S2 gene, and the H120-like genome fragments within the M protein gene. This would again suggest that IBVs in Taiwan undergo genetic recombination and evolution.",

These types included a Mass-type (respiratory form), a JP-I (respiratory, kidney and reproductive form), a JP-II (kidney form), and a JP-III (respiratory and kidney form). Later, Shieh et al. (2004) demonstrated a new Japanese IBV subtype, which had a S1 sequence most similar to those of Australian strains, while the N sequence was closely related to those of North American strains. This new Japanese variant might have recombined with Australian-related and North American-related IBVs. Shimazaki et al. (2008) subsequently described a new virulent 4/91 variant. These viruses caused severe respiratory symptoms and weight loss in young chicks. The S1 analysis indicated that the isolates were closely related to Spanish and French isolates, suggesting that the 4/91 variants were derived from a foreign field isolate. In addition, some IBV strains had high sequence similarity with that of a 4/91 vaccine strain commonly used in Japan, suggesting that vaccine-like viruses were derived from a vaccine (Shimazaki et al. 2009). Earlier, in 2002, Japan had introduced the 4/91 IBV vaccine, and was trading a large amount of poultry products from European countries. The introduction of the vaccine, and the trading of poultry products, might have provided the transmission routes for those strains (Mase et al. 2008). Subsequently, Mase et al. (2010) reported a novel genotype isolated in 2009, designated as JP-IV. This variant was isolated from commercial layers unable to start laying eggs. Neither respiratory form of IB nor increased mortality was observed. The sequence analysis indicated that the isolate shared an ancestor with an IBV isolated in the south of China, namely the TC07-2 strain. So far, overall investigations of circulating IBVs in Japan indicate cross-transmission from foreign isolates as well as continual evolution.",

            "text": "Outbreaks caused by IBVs were first reported in Korea in 1986 from a laying flock that exhibited decreased egg production (Rhee et al. 1986). A nephropathogenic strain was then identified in 1990. Following this, a wide variety of IBV strains were classified. Three clusters were differentiated into non-Korean strains, including Arkansas (Ark), Conn, and Mass types, whereas the rest of the IBV strains, such as a KM91, were unique to Korea (Lee et al. 2004). In the beginning, a Mass-type IBV was the only vaccine strain used in Korea (King 1988). But, at a later date, vaccine strains based on a Mass, a H120, and a KM91 were also implemented to control IB. The common Korean IBV, isolated between 2001 and 2003 from broilers and broiler breeders, was classified as KM91 and Ark-type isolates (Jang et al. 2007). Later, Lee et al. (2008) studied the genetic groups of IBVs obtained from 2003 to 2006, which indicated that the unique Korean (K-I) group could be further divided into the respiratory subgroups K-Ia and K-Ib. Furthermore, the K-II group was closely related to nephropathogenic variants isolated from China and Japan, while the K-III group was closely related to the enteric IBV isolated from China that caused proventriculitis. From these results, K-Ia and K-II were the most prevalent strains. Recently, it was shown that the new clusters of Korean IBVs had recombination events of the S1 gene with putative parental strains originating from KM91-like or QX-like subgroups (Lim et al. 2011). More recently, Mo et al. (2013) identified an IBV circulation in Korea from the isolates from 1990 to 2011. These findings indicated that New Cluster 1 was prevalent between 2009 and 2010, and was then replaced by the predominant QX-like virus in 2011. Another recent study by Song et al. (2013) also declared the recombination of Korean IBV to be between an indigenous Korean-type and Mass-type vaccines currently used in Korea (such as Ma5, H52, and H120 vaccines). Likewise, a recombination was also predicted between the following: (1) New Cluster 1 and QX-like, (2) K-I and H120, and (3) KM91 and QX-like. In conclusion, the currently circulating Korean IBVs appear to be a respiratory strain K-I, a nephropathogenic strain K-II with subgroups KM91-like and QX-like, an enteric strain, and some other recent strains (for example, K-III, New Cluster 1, and New Cluster 2). Natural recombinations occur frequently between these heterologous strains and vaccines that were classified into different genetic groups, and may cause the continuous evolution of new IBV variants in Korea.",

Ten years later, an isolated virus, which exhibited tracheal and pulmonary congestion, was detected from a layer farm in Selangor bordered by Perak to the north. The S1 phylogenetic analysis of these two isolates indicated non-M41 strains, but one of them shared about 90% identity with the Chinese QX-like IBV. Another isolate belonged to a variant strain with lower identity to the known reference IBVs.

Later, IB was shown to be a disease with important economic consequences for the Thai poultry industry. Although vaccines, such as Conn, H120, Ma5, Mass, and Armidale A3, appeared to be very commonly used in commercial farms, IBV spread all over the country. The most common IBV strains in Thailand belonged to a Mass-type, but a 4/91-type IBV was also reported (Cook et al. 1996). Genetically, the recently isolated Thai IBVs were characterized and found to be similar to the QX-like strain, and the indigenous strain was identified according to the HVR of the S1 gene (Pohuang et al. 2009). Most of the isolates were from H120-vaccinated commercial broiler flocks raised in central Thailand. These flocks suffered from airway problems. Pohuang et al. (2011) isolated and identified the viruses based on a full-length S1 gene analysis. The viruses were, therefore, classified into the following groups: a group unique to Thailand Group I, a QX-like Group II, and a Mass-type Group III. This study also showed the recombination events of the local isolates. The viruses in Group I had 5\u2032-terminus of the THA001 origin isolated in Thailand in the late 1990s, while the 3\u2032-terminus belonged to the QX-like Group II. In addition, the viruses in Group II shared the S1 sequence of the Chinese QX-IBV, but the rest of the sequence belonged to the Chinese strain JX/99/01. Further studies are required to determine the circulation and recombination of IBV variants in other parts of the country. In fact, the vaccination program needs to be revised.",

This IBV was isolated from the outbreak that caused diseases in one- to two-week-old commercial broilers. Diseases resulted in visceral gout and nephritis. Clinical signs showed respiratory disorders. Grossly, distended ureters filled with uric acid, interstitial nephritis, granular degeneration, vacuolation, and desquamation of tubular epithelium were observed. Eventually, by virus isolation and sequencing, Sumi et al. (2012) confirmed a novel nephropathogenic IBV that belonged to a 4/91 genotype.

            "text": "In Iran, IB is one of the most important respiratory diseases of broilers. The first isolation of an IBV in Iranian poultry was reported in 1994 (Aghakhan et al. 1994). Several Iranian isolates were identified at a later date, and a 4/91-type appeared to be one of the predominant types (Shoushtari et al. 2008). Mass-type vaccines are the only officially authorized vaccines. In vaccinated flocks, failure of the Mass-type vaccination often occurred, either due to the use of unrelated vaccine strains, or due to there being no partial cross protection of vaccines against field isolates (Seyfi Abad Shapouri et al. 2004). Boroomand et al. (2012) studied the Iranian 4/91-IBV infection in one-day-old commercial broilers, demonstrating that this particular strain was widely distributed in tissue of the respiratory, urogenital, and digestive tracts. However, they observed only mild clinical respiratory signs and depression. The Iranian 4/91 isolates were thus unlikely to cause mortality, severe clinical signs, or gross lesions in infected poultry. Instead, they replicated virus in some tissues that made birds susceptible to other pathogens because of the failure of the immune system. In addition, Asasi et al. (2013) studied acute-phase factors, pro-inflammatory cytokines and serum sialic acids, indicating that these variables increased after inoculation with an Iranian IBV. Moreover, they did not find many other IBV strains, such as the common Mass-type virus (Jahantigh et al. 2013). In summary, at present, IBV isolates in Iran belong predominantly to the 4/91 type, and ultimately, improvements to the vaccination program will be required.",

However, outbreaks have continued to occur repeatedly, which has resulted in high mortality in broiler farms, associated with renal lesions in both vaccinated and non-vaccinated flocks. Recently, a new genotype in Iraq, designated as the nephropathogenic Sul/01/09 genotype, was discovered by sequencing the S1 gene, and was compared with the other known IBVs (Mahmood et al. 2011). This new genotype was isolated from commercial poultry that suffered from kidney disease, despite regular immunization with 4/91 and Ma5 vaccines. This kidney-type IBV was closely related to viruses isolated in Israel and Egypt. Furthermore, Amin et al. (2012) demonstrated a QX-like IBV in Iraq, isolated from vaccinated broiler breeders that suffered from several clinical signs related to respiratory disease. Post-mortem examination revealed purulent inflammation in the bronchi and edema in subcutaneous tissue. All of the animals were immunized with Mass-type, H120, and Ma5 vaccines. The S1 phylogeny revealed that the viruses showed a high nucleotide identity with those of QX-like Chinese strains isolated between 2009 and 2010. However, some isolates had a nucleotide identity that correlated with the unique QX-type virus sequence from the Middle East-type isolated in Israel in 2004.

Later, in 2000, severe outbreaks of a novel IBV variant caused acute renal disease, high mortality, and poor weight gain in vaccinated broilers. The outbreaks resulted in huge economic losses to the Israeli broiler industry. This isolated IBV was then identified as a new nephropathogenic variant. The virus shared approximately 70% similarity with the vaccine strain H120. With the H120 protection test, 91% protection to the trachea and only 25% protection to the kidney were observed. In addition to the H120 relationship, this virus was also closely related to the Egyptian isolates (Meir et al. 2004). More recently, Gelb et al. (2005) studied the Israeli IBV strains, mainly associated with respiratory and renal diseases, isolated between 1996 and 2000 from broilers and layers. Four genetic groups were clustered by a restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) fragment pattern of the S1 gene as follows: a Mass-type, a Variant I, a Variant II, and a novel group. These isolated IBVs had a poor level of protection by the H120 vaccine. Thus, using homologous viruses as vaccines would ensure the efficacy of IB control.",

Further investigations indicated the presence of IBV field serotypes other than the Mass-type. By hemagglutination inhibition (HI) titers, Ark, DE-075-like, JMK, and Mass-like serotypes were shown to be present. Similarly, the Mass and other serotypes were also classified in other Middle-Eastern countries (Gharaibeh 2007; Roussan, Haddad, et al. 2008). Moreover, Roussan, Totanji, et al. (2008) studied genotyping of IBV in Jordanian broiler flocks suffering from respiratory disease. They detected specific groups of a Mass-type, a 4/91-type, and a D274-type IBV. Roussan et al. (2009) subsequently studied commercial broilers, broiler breeders, and layers that were free from respiratory disease, indicating seropositivity for Mass, 4/91, and D274 serotypes. Ababneh et al. (2012) subsequently reported the IB outbreaks investigated in Iraq, Jordan, and Saudi Arabia in which diseases were associated with respiratory signs accompanied by nephritis, watery cysts in the ovary, and swollen oviducts resulting in egg production problems. Phylogenetics based on the HVR of the S1 gene referred to a Chinese CK/CH/LDL/97I isolate, indicating its Far Eastern origins. All of these flocks were vaccinated based on Mass and H120 strains, suggesting vaccination failure since less than 80% nucleotides were found to be identical to the vaccine strains. An IBV strain CK/CH/LDL/97I that caused proventriculitis in poultry was first reported in China in 1995 (Liu et al. 2009). In recent years, this strain has been isolated from other organs of infected birds, such as the trachea. Amino acid homology of the S1 gene of this strain was less than 79% compared with those vaccine strains used in Jordan (Ababneh et al. 2012). Therefore, only homologous protection should be considered to accomplish immunity against this strain. Ultimately, the Far Eastern IBV variants detected in the Middle East illustrate that the active spreading of IBVs within and between geographic areas in this region continues to evolve.",

Moreover, major IBV types found in the Far Eastern countries consist of the following: QX-type and QX-like viruses; new IBV variants derived from recombination events between local, foreign, and vaccine strains; and some indigenous local-type viruses. However, particular QX variants seem to be the predominant Asian IBV strains that may well play a crucial role in their spreading throughout Asia. In addition, they have also spread to European countries (Beato et al. 2005; Bochkov et al. 2006; Valastro et al. 2010). In the Middle East, a 4/91-type is the prevalent type. Some others (for example, Iraq/IS720/Sul/01/09 and Egypt/IS720/Beni-Seuf/01 isolates) are circulating in northern African countries. In addition, co-circulation of the existing IBV strains, as well as the currently used live vaccines, may also play a major role in the potential recombination of IBVs, making the incidence of new evolving IBV variants highly likely (reviewed in de Wit et al. 2011; Jackwood 2012). Most of the newly emerged IBVs were not significantly genetically identical to vaccine strains used in a particular area, resulting in low protection or even vaccination failure.",

            "text": "In Asia, the backyard poultry system is often correlated with the rural community, and greatly contributes to local consumption and agricultural activities. The purpose of backyard poultry farming in rural areas is either small-scale production or a non-commercial operation (free-ranging domesticated birds). Traditional poultry trading is often conducted daily or weekly. Therefore, flocks may get infected by vehicles or equipment and tools shared between farms. Egg collection, transport, and trading activities among poultry farms can spread the disease to other flocks (Figure 2). For instance, in Cambodia, poultry being moved to live bird markets via poultry traders was a potential \u2018hub\u2019 for the spread of HPAI H5N1 (van Kerkhove et al. 2009). In Vietnam, the route from poultry traders to live bird markets was the key to HPAI H5N1 transmission (Soares-Magalhaes 2010). Furthermore, study on poultry market chains in China demonstrated that H5N1-infected live poultry markets presented a more significant problem than non-infected markets (Martin 2011). In Thailand, although the number of poultry traded in traditional networks is small compared with other production systems, poultry trading continues all year round, and may thus surreptitiously contribute to the spread of any disease. Live backyard poultry trading is usually based on the activities of traders who buy chickens from villages and supply urban markets with poultry meat products. In addition, trade always flows from live poultry to slaughterhouses (Choprakarn & Wongpichet 2007). Poolkhet, Chairatanayuth, Thongratsakul, Kasemsuwan, et al. (2013) studied the movement and trading patterns of backyard poultry in Thailand. With regard to the spread of H5N1 to the backyard farming area, they found that the pattern of disease transmission was local spreading outwardly. They also indicated a close relationship between owners' houses and fresh food markets. This relationship needs the attention of authorities to prevent future outbreaks. At the same time, Poolkhet, Chairatanayuth, Thongratsakul, Yatbantoong, et al. (2013) specified that the important factors in the spread of avian flu in backyard farming systems are the farmers themselves, neighbors with backyard poultry, and visitors to sport arenas or training fields of fighting poultry. Moreover, Wiratsudakul et al. (2014) studied the dynamics of backyard poultry flows in traditional trade networks. Flows of backyard poultry trade indicated that traders ran businesses only near their villages. The average distance of poultry movement ranged from 4 to 25 kilometers, determining a spatial scale for the risk of H5N1 transmission to be spread through the traditional poultry market. As a result, overlapping poultry supply zones might also enable disease transmission over extensive distances through combined expansion and the relocation process. In addition, an increased number of poultry being traded occurred during special Asian festivals such as the Chinese New Year (February), the Thai New Year (April), and the international New Year (January). Live poultry movements and activities precede these festivals by about 15 days, which might lead to a higher risk of disease transmission compared to the other months of the year.\n\n",

Field observations and infection under laboratory conditions indicated that the virus from guinea fowl had a host range of more than one bird species. Besides, it was shown that the viral protein of peafowl CoVs had more than 99% identity with the commercial IBV H120 vaccines (Liu et al. 2005). This indicated that the viruses recovered from peafowl had originated from vaccinated chickens in the same neighborhood.

In line with this, it was already shown that pathogenic avian influenza viruses could be transmitted via a variety of bird species, including wild birds, domestic captive birds, and free-range village birds (Tiensin 2011) (Figure 2). In summary, IBVs can replicate in galliform species other than chickens and in some non-galliform birds. The viruses isolated from these birds, however, are genetically related, whether they are of IBV origin or they are the common viruses found in these birds. Thus, different bird species may potentially transmit viruses to other free-living birds, or to susceptible poultry populations, when they are in contact with each other under any given circumstance.",

Therefore, it is necessary to know which IBV types are circulating in particular farms and in their neighborhoods.

This generates new IBV strains or genotypes worldwide. In line with this, it has been shown that the re-assortment and adaptation of RNA viruses to the hosts that generate the diversity of viruses, for example, has led to various subtypes of pathogenic AIV (Nichol et al. 2000; Yu et al. 2001; Jackwood 2012). In addition to genetic variation, a complex interplay of factors influencing IBV emergence may also play an important role. These include environmental factors such as ecological change, social movement, and behavioral influences. Moreover, global expansion of agriculture, rapid population growth, advances of transportation, illegal trading, inefficient biosecurity, and traditional farming systems that are unaware of IB can be associated with factors playing a role in IBV emergence (Nichol et al. 2000; Bayry 2013).",

Strict farming management provides a well-established biosecurity, and an adequate vaccination program for commercial poultry. In contrast, if poor husbandry continues to take place among small-holder and backyard poultry producers living in areas of geographic concentration and high housing density, dispersed throughout rural areas, this will greatly augment the spread of IB. Traditional poultry farming may also facilitate continuous spreading of IBV within the area, and perhaps to flocks in the surrounding regions. Thus, compartmentalization of backyard poultry farming is one of the most successful management procedures to reduce the transmission of diseases to commercial and non-commercial poultry. Moreover, resident and migratory free-living birds may harbor IBVs and transmit them to other birds, or they may carry common ACoVs in nature that can spread to poultry and other bird populations. These birds may also play a critical role in the epidemiology of IB.",

Factors contributing to co-circulation and generation of new emerging IBV strains are as follows: (1) genetic variation of the IBV as a result of mutations, insertions, and deletions, especially in the S1 genes; (2) recombination between local IBV strains circulating in the poultry flocks; (3) recombination between local strains and vaccine strains used in the field; and (4) interaction of environmental and social factors. Therefore, future multidisciplinary approaches require further useful information, focusing on the ongoing genotype evolution, monitoring ACoV circulation in avian species, and providing risk analyses of small-scale native poultry production. This information could be variously obtained by means of virology, bioinformatics, and epidemiology of ACoV-associated diseases.",
