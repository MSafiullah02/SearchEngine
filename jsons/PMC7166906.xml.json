            "text": "Ecological theory suggests that multiple environmental factors shape local species assemblages by progressively filtering species from the regional species pool to local communities. One approach to identify environmental factors of importance for species filtering is to analyse functional trait characteristics, defined as the morphological, physiological and phenological features measurable at the individual level (Diaz, Cabido & Casanoves 1998; Garnier et al. 2004; McGill et al. 2006; Shipley 2010). A wide range of traits can be used to describe the response of species to their environment, and different traits may capture different aspects of the resource use and habitat requirements of the species (e.g. Bornette et al. 1994; Suding et al. 2006; Thuiller et al. 2010). For plants, traits related to life\u2010form characteristics, growth forms, growth rates, photosynthetic pathways, leaf morphology and chemistry have all been used to describe responses to environmental conditions as they may affect species growth, survival and reproductive output (Violle et al. 2007; Cavalli, Baattrup\u2010Pedersen & Riis 2014).",

Indeed, selective changes in community trait composition can be expected to severely affect community functional diversity (Cadotte 2011) independently of other possible random trait losses accompanying decreases in species richness. Gaining insight into the direction and the outcome of changes in trait composition caused by natural and anthropogenic drivers is therefore essential for understanding the response of communities to change (Diaz et al. 2007; Moretti & Legg 2009) as well as effects on ecosystem services (Tilman et al. 1997; but see Garcia\u2010Llorente et al. 2011). Such insight may help identifying the trait characteristics of species with specific sensitivity towards anthropogenic pressures in different types of ecosystems, which, in turn, may enable society to take adequate measures to combat species loss.",

Despite a general decline in nitrogen and phosphorus loads to freshwater ecosystems in Europe during the last two decades, concentrations are still beyond those considered critical for freshwater ecosystems (Soer 2010). Furthermore, the influence from agricultural emissions is expected to increase in the coming years. This is due to a projected increase in nitrogen fertilizer use by around 4% in 2020 combined with an increasing proportional role of agriculture for phosphorus loss through progressive implementation of the Urban Wastewater Treatment Directive mitigating phosphorus loss from point sources (Soer 2010). High agricultural intensity is also often associated with physical modifications of aquatic habitats such as channelization of stream reaches to facilitate run\u2010off from cultivated land, which completely or partly alters the environmental conditions supporting the biotic communities.",

By analysing community\u2010weighted means of functional trait characteristics, we gain knowledge of indicative traits and, in extension, also the mechanisms likely responsible for the changes in community structure. The use of community\u2010weighted means of trait characteristics may therefore give valuable new insight of importance for aquatic managers in their identification of possible causes of non\u2010compliance with good ecological status in lowland streams required by the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD) and to select appropriate mitigation measures.",

            "text": "In the present study, we investigate the functional trait composition of plant communities in a large number of European lowland streams classified into small and medium\u2010sized streams according to the WFD typology and, furthermore, relationships between trait composition and the proportion of agricultural land use in the catchments. Several important physical characteristics that are known to affect plant compositional patterns change according to stream size (Haslam 1978). These include an increase in discharge, velocity, channel width and depth and a decrease in light availability with increasing stream size (Sand\u2010Jensen et al. 2006), whereas substratum characteristics, which also play an important role for the plant composition in streams (Butcher 1933; Baattrup\u2010Pedersen & Riis 1999), vary more unpredictably with stream size (Sand\u2010Jensen et al. 2006). Considering that plant compositional patterns reflect the filtering of the regional species pool to local environmental conditions, we hypothesize that multiple functional characteristics of the plant communities will respond to stream size. Specifically, we expect to find traits characterizing helophytes living in the transition zone between land and water to be proportionally more abundant in small streams than in medium\u2010sized streams. This will be reflected in a higher proportion of emergent species growing from apical meristems and regenerating from seeds and a higher proportion of species with heterophylly (a specific adaptation to maximize resource uptake at changing water levels) in small compared to medium\u2010sized streams. On the other hand, traits characterizing hydrophytes should be proportionally more abundant in medium\u2010sized streams, indicated by a higher proportion of submerged species forming large and dense canopies and of species that are tolerant of lower light availabilities. Since submerged species exhibit a number of adaptations to life in water, including mechanical fragmentation with subsequent regeneration of whole plants from the fragment and the ability to form specialized buds or turions which survive winter when the rest of the vegetative parts decay (Hutchinson 1975), we also expect that these traits will be proportionally more abundant in the plant community in medium\u2010sized streams than in small streams.",

            "text": "Additionally, we expect that the functional characteristics of the plant communities will be influenced by agricultural intensity in the catchments. Eutrophication is one of the most widespread environmental problems in freshwater ecosystems. Yet, the mechanisms driving changes in plant composition along nutrient\u2010enrichment gradients in streams and rivers remain unsolved (Demars et al. 2012). Here, we test two non\u2010mutually exclusive hypotheses with the aim to identify the main mechanism causing these changes (Fig. 1). The first hypothesis suggests that eutrophication directly promotes productive species with fast growth, building on the assumption that nutrients are limiting for plant growth (Carignan & Kalff 1980; Mesters 1995; Mainstone & Parr 2002). This assumption also forms the framework for existing plant\u2010based WFD\u2010compliant assessment systems building on expert knowledge of the nutrient preferences of single species (Holmes et al. 1999; Birk & Wilby 2010; see Demars et al. 2012 and references therein). Provided that the main drivers for changes in community composition under eutrophication are nutrients, we expect to find an increase in the proportion of highly productive plant species with increasing nutrient availability. According to Grime (1988), this should be reflected in an increase in the proportion of species with an ecological preference for high nutrient levels (high Ellenberg N) as well as an increase in tall species forming dense standing crops with extensive lateral spread. The second hypothesis suggests that the main driver of changes in community composition is light limitation caused by increased water turbidity and biofilm growth in addition to enhanced aquatic plant growth (Sand\u2010Jensen 1990; Hilton et al. 2006). According to this hypothesis, we expect to find an increase in the proportion of species that can compete efficiently under light\u2010limiting conditions. This can be accomplished either by concentrating the photosynthetic biomass in the uppermost waters by possessing apical growth and/or by producing floating leaves, which both serve to maximize light uptake, or by having efficient light utilization so growth can be maintained under low light availabilities (low Ellenberg L).",

(2012). By applying a one\u2010way anova, we did not find that the distribution of highly modified, slightly modified and unmodified stream channels varied with agricultural intensity in the catchment. On the other hand, we found strong indications that the main stressor operating along this gradient was eutrophication since NO3, PO4 and conductivity were the variables that best explained variation along the agricultural intensity gradient (F3, 230 = 52\u00b719; P < 0\u00b7001; r = 0\u00b763). Since the quality of the nutrient data was rather poor, reflecting differences in sampling effort and timing, we decided to use intensity in agricultural land use as a proxy for eutrophication. This approach has been confirmed in previous studies observing close linkages between agricultural land use and eutrophication (e.g. Jones et al. 2001; Galbraith & Burns 2007; Monaghan et al. 2009), reflecting that intensified land use increases diffuse source contaminants in terms of nutrients and sediment load to stream sites (Allan 2004; Ballantine & Davies\u2010Colley 2014; Evans et al. 2014).",

The traits covered life\u2010form characteristics and traits related to morphology, dispersal, reproduction and survival as well as ecological indicator values of nutrients (Ellenberg N; EN) and light (Ellenberg L; EL; Ellenberg et al. 1991) (Table 2).

Growth morphology described the position of the meristem growth point and was divided into three categories: single basal (Meris.sb), single apical (Meris.sa) and multi\u2010apical (Meris.ma) (Table 2).

We also included traits related to survival in terms of overwintering organs (Overwintering.org) such as tubers, turions and rhizomes. Some inevitable redundancy may occur between the traits as the distinction between vegetative parts serving for reserve and those for dispersal is complex among aquatic plants.

Based on species abundance patterns and trait characteristics, we identified five groups of species in the cluster analysis that were characterized by different trait characteristics (Fig. 2a,b; Table 3). Species group 1 was characterized by species with low EN, growing from single apical growth meristems rooted to the stream bottom with submerged and/or floating, sometimes heterophyllous leaves (e.g. P. natans, A. plantago\u2010aquatica) together with a few less frequent species growing from basal growth meristems (e.g. L. natans and S. natans; Fig. 3; Table 3). Species group 2 was characterized by slightly more productive species growing from single and multi\u2010apical growth meristems with submerged and sometimes heterophyllous leaves including several Callitriche and Ranunculus species and a few species with emergent leaves (e.g. V. anagallis\u2010aquatica; Fig. 3; Table 3). Both groups 1 and 2 had high abundances of species dispersed by seeds. Group 3 was also dominated by anchored species with submerged leaves (e.g. P. pectinatus) as well as species with both submerged and emerged leaves (e.g. Myosotis palustris, Berula erecta). Species in group 3 were slightly more productive than those in groups 1 and 2 (Fig. 3). Similar to group 2 species, group 3 species grew from multi\u2010 and single apical growth meristems, but in contrast to group 2 they had low preference values for light (Fig. 3). Groups 4 and 5 were both dominated by productive species (Fig. 3). Group 4 was dominated by free\u2010floating plants with small leaf\u2010like thalli (e.g. Lemna sp., S. polyrhiza and A. filiculoides; Fig. 3, Table 3), whereas group 5 was dominated by submerged species with floating and/or submerged and/or emergent leaves (e.g. S. emersum, S. erectum and E. canadensis; Fig. 3; Table 3). Both groups 4 and 5 were dominated by species growing from basal growth meristems (Fig. 3). Group 5 was also dominated by species with high specific leaf areas compared to the other groups (Fig. 3).",

We did not find an increase in the abundance of productive species with increasing eutrophication; rather, species capable of concentrating the photosynthetic active biomass in the uppermost waters by possessing single and multi\u2010apical growth meristems rose in abundance as did species with efficient light utilization. This response is likely a consequence of intensified competition for light, reflecting that light becomes the overall limiting factor for growth in nutrient\u2010enriched streams.
