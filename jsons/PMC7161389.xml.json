COPD is the fifth leading cause of death worldwide, and the mortality and morbidity are often associated with episodes of symptom deterioration termed exacerbations. Furthermore, whereas death rates in other prevalent conditions are falling, mortality from COPD continues to rise. Exacerbations of COPD account for about 1 in 10 emergency medical admissions to the hospital, and the in-hospital mortality is 10%. Exacerbations are consequently responsible for 70% of the direct costs attributable to COPD.",

On average, patients with moderate to severe COPD, typical of those attending secondary care, will have one or two exacerbations requiring additional treatment annually. However, annual exacerbation incidence rates differ greatly among individual patients, and those prone to more frequent exacerbations experience a particular burden of disease (Figure 43-1\n). The best determinant of future exacerbation history is past exacerbation frequency, such that some patients appear more intrinsically susceptible and some more resistant to these important events.",

Airway inflammation is even greater at exacerbation, and the assumption has been that this additional inflammation provokes symptoms such as worsening dyspnea and sputum production, through mechanisms relating to airway tone, airway wall edema, and mucus production. The resultant air trapping increases the work of breathing and causes additional impairment to respiratory muscle function. Triggers of increased airway inflammation are therefore the causes of exacerbation, predominantly tracheobronchial infection, with a lesser role for pollutants. However, the effects of increased inflammation at exacerbation require further clarification, because a direct relationship between the clinical severity of the exacerbation and the degree of airway inflammation has never been conclusively demonstrated.",

Recent advances in molecular biology have isolated respiratory viruses and potentially pathogenic bacteria from the airways of most patients during exacerbations (Box 43-1\n). However, certainly for patients with more severe underlying disease, bacteria also are often present in the stable state (bacterial colonization). Therefore the presence of an organism at exacerbation does not assume a role in causing that exacerbation. More recent studies suggest that a change in the colonizing bacterial strain may be the precipitating cause. However, not all strain changes are associated with exacerbation, and vice versa. Reflecting this, as discussed later, antibiotics are not of universal benefit during exacerbations. Rhinovirus is the most often identified viral pathogen, and thus exacerbations are more common during the winter months, when viral circulation in the community is higher. The role of atypical organisms such as Chlamydia and Mycoplasma species appears minimal.Box 43-1Common Organisms Isolated at Exacerbation of COPDBacteria\n\nHaemophilus influenzae\n\nMoraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis\n\nStreptococcus pneumoniae\n\nPseudomonas aeruginosa\n*\n\nRespiratory Viruses\nRhinovirusInfluenzaParainfluenzaCoronavirusRespiratory syncytial virusAdenovirus\n",

Simple venous blood tests include complete blood count, urea and electrolytes, and C-reactive protein. A typical chest radiograph at exacerbation (Figure 43-3\n) should appear much the same as the patient's radiograph in the stable state. Spirometry is not generally helpful because absolute values may be misleading, changes at exacerbation are small, and patients acutely dyspneic have difficulty performing the maneuvers.

Consequently, the degree of health care utilization has been used as a surrogate assessment of severity: mild exacerbations require no more than an increase in inhaled bronchodilators, moderate exacerbations require antibiotics and corticosteroids in the community, and patients with severe exacerbations require hospital admission. The pH is the best indicator of an acute change in alveolar ventilation, and most exacerbations associated with respiratory failure will require hospital assessment.

Local resistance patterns and antibiotic policies will dictate the choice of drug, but coverage should include the common pathogens Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella (Branhamella) catarrhalis, and Streptococcus pneumoniae. An oral aminopenicillin, macrolide, or tetracycline is therefore an appropriate empirical choice. Comparative data across drug classes are sparse. Intravenous antibiotics are rarely required.

Oxygen should be administered in a controlled manner with monitoring of ABG tensions to avoid carbon dioxide (CO2) retention and development of hypercapnic respiratory failure that may occur in a proportion of patients (those classically said to rely on hypoxic respiratory drive). Studies have shown little risk of hypercapnia if oxygen is titrated to a maximum saturation of 90% to 92%.

Some patients never seem to recover their preexacerbation lung function. Patients admitted have an in-hospital mortality of about 10%, and for patients with hypercapnic respiratory failure, mortality approaches 50% at 2 years. Some patients may be suitable for early supported discharge, associated with similar outcomes but apparently no more cost-effective than standard care.",

Mounting evidence suggests that a number of drug classes are able to reduce exacerbation rates, including the long-acting \u03b22-agonists (LABAs), long acting anticholinergics, and inhaled corticosteroids (ICS), at least for those with moderately severe underlying disease. Combination therapy with LABAs and ICS appears superior to the use of either alone. Oral corticosteroids are ineffective at preventing exacerbations and have no effect on other outcomes measures, so these also are not indicated in stable COPD. Mucolytics may reduce exacerbation frequency in those with milder disease not taking ICS.",

Patients receiving two or more such courses (\u201cfrequent exacerbators\u201d) are likely to remain frequent exacerbators in the future and should be offered all appropriate exacerbation reduction interventions (see Figure 43-1).",

Not many years ago, these events were considered nothing more than \u201ctroublesome\u201d deteriorations in symptoms without long-term consequence. We now know this is not true, but many unanswered questions remain. We still understand little about how bacterial and viral pathogens interact. More effective antiinflammatory agents are required, and the optimal role of antibiotics in preventing exacerbations remains to be defined. We currently have no effective interventions targeting viral pathogens, especially rhinovirus. Understanding why some patients appear more susceptible to exacerbations could lead to the development of new therapeutic approaches. Also, it is now recognized that COPD is associated with systemic inflammation that may cause considerable cardiovascular comorbidity, and ways to assess and manage this may reduce the number and impact of exacerbations in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.",
