By the 60 end of April, over 37,000 cases had been reported in the whole of Africa, with substantial variation in 61 the reported cumulative incidence across different countries 4 . This inter-country heterogeneity can 62 be due to a wide range of factors, such as the number of imported infections, the capacity to 63 conduct tests for COVID-19, surveillance efforts, as well as travel and movement restrictions which 64 vary widely from country to country depending on the local context 5 . The reported data alone thus 65 do not provide a clear depiction of the outbreak situation especially in countries with very limited 66 surveillance capacities, and additional studies are needed to narrow the knowledge gap between the 67 reported data and the real disease burdens. 68",

Under the assumption that stay-at-home order 187 reduces the reproduction number to 1.5, we found four African countries where the estimated 188 probability of reaching 10,000 infections by end of March was higher than 50% ( Figure 2A ). This 189 number quickly rose to 34 countries reaching this number of infections by the end of April, and 47 190 countries by end May (Figures 2B, 2C) . For the alternative scenario where the reproduction number 191 is reduced to 1.0 by stay-at-home order, the numbers of African countries with a higher-than-50% 192 estimated probability of reaching 10,000 infections by end of March, April, and May were 3, 23, and 193 32 respectively (Figures 2D-2F) . Notably, four countries (Angola, Gambia, Mozambique, and Sao 194 Tome and Principe) were found to have reported less than 100 cases by end of April whilst the 195 estimated probability of reaching 10,000 infections by then was higher than 50% even under the 196 more optimistic scenario ( Figures 2E, 2H ), suggesting that a very substantial number of cases may 197 have been undetected.

Close attention should therefore be paid to where will be the next 257 epicentre, perhaps within Africa, and how this could translate into imported cases for each country, 258 particularly for those countries that we estimate to have experienced lower numbers of imported 259 cases previously and therefore lower onward transmission. 260",

Despite these limitations, most of our model assumptions throughout the analyses 270 have been fairly conservative to avoid inflating the projections of the SARS-CoV-2 spread.

Simulations of the onward spread of the virus were based on the 274 estimated number of imported infections from the selected 10 epicentre countries, and stay-at-275 home order was assumed to be effective (reproduction numbers being 1.5 and 1.0 in the two 276 scenarios we considered) and sustainable.
