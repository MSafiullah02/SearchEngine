There are many technologies to surveil the spatial-temporal characteristics of infectious diseases, such as sentinel surveillance, clinical-based surveillance, questionnaires or surveys, hospital admission data, mortality and morbidity rates, which hold great significance for infectious disease surveillance [4]. However, most of these approaches depend on acquired data and information, such as incidence and mortality rates, prescription data and hospitalization information, and herein, most of these systems are passive monitoring forms. Therefore, these techniques are subject to bias, resource insensitivity, detection blindness and high cost [5]. Taking countries with limited health services as an example, the incidence rate may be higher than the assumed value due to a lack of access to health services [6]. There are blind areas for epidemic monitoring using traditional techniques. Because infectious disease testing is not available to everyone, potential patients and asymptomatic patients cannot be effectively counted and monitored, leading to an unknown extent of the spread. For example, it has been reported that approximately 60% of asymptomatic or mild SARS-CoV-2 infections may lead to a second outbreak [7]. Sometimes in serious epidemics, laboratory facilities are easily overburdened, and many cases are not reported. In addition, with the acceleration of global urbanization and the unprecedented growth in population, higher requirements are proposed for rapid health monitoring and response, which undoubtedly poses a challenge to the existing infectious disease monitoring and management system.",

Considering the current insufficient clinical and laboratory information [8], it is valuable to provide a novel surveillance and early warning techniques to compensate for the shortcomings of traditional tools/methods and to provide comprehensive and timely population exposure and disease results.

It is important that as a whole, the population contributes to the collection of wastewater from any wastewater collection point, and the wastewater from this community can be regarded as its collected urine. It is assumed that the identification and quantification of exogenous and endogenous biomarkers in community wastewater reflects the health status of the community population in real time. These biomarkers are derived from specific human excretions (such as metabolites or endogenous chemicals resulting from exposure to and/or disease) [9], as well as associated microorganisms/pathogens [10], which can reflect the health and living habits of the community because they contain rich biological and chemical information.",

He assumed that the analysis of drug residues in wastewater could be linked with population use [11]. Later, Zuccato et al achieved the goal of WBE for the first time in 2005 by successfully quantifying cocaine in wastewater to investigate cocaine consumption in the community [12]. Since then, research on WBE has been conducted around the world [13]. Initially, the focus was entirely on the abuse of illicit drugs (http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/activities/wastewater-analysis), such as heroin[14], cocaine[15], ketamine[16], methamphetamine[13] and new psychoactive substances[17]. Most countries have monitored the use of illicit drugs through WBE for epidemiological studies. Notably, China uses WBE for practical policy making and action related to drug control activity[18].",

When the presence of biomarkers is reported, the daily load in the wastewater is usually reported. In addition, to normalize cities of different geographical locations and population sizes to allow for comparison, daily load per capita can be reported. The back calculation process for biomarkers throughout the community can provide an unbiased response to key aspects of infectious disease information. In addition, not only can the spatial-temporal trends be determined but this information can also be monitored in real time to detect deviations from the general trend as early as possible. Due to cost and logistical challenges, WBE provides advantages compared to biomonitoring technologies that focus on small target groups, as WBE is population wide and thus maintains the anonymity of individuals. Compared with other traditional surveillance systems, WBE can provide timely analysis, which can allow public services to respond quickly and adopt possible health interventions before infectious disease transmission and outbreaks.",

There have been many reports about virus determination in wastewater [23, 24, 25, 26]. Wastewater analysis of polio has been used since the 1980s, when Finland[27] and Israel[28] successfully analysed wastewater to assess the spread of polio. The WHO has issued guidelines for monitoring polio in wastewater samples using environmental monitoring [4]. Wastewater analysis can also be used for retrospective prediction of the outbreak of hepatitis A and norovirus[29]. In terms of the COVID-19 pandemic, many scientists are trying to use WBE to detect SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater to screen potential virus carriers and provide early warning of COVID-19 outbreaks in the community [30].",

As mentioned above, wastewater contains a wide range of chemical and biological substances that can provide incredible amounts of information about the population. However, one disadvantage of having such a large amount of information is that it must be successfully extracted from the matrix, and subsequent analysis of specific targets may be difficult.

Due to this distribution effect, when analysed by dPCR, the effect of PCR inhibitors in wastewater is small[40]. Next-generation sequencing is another promising technology that provides substantial information about the complex microbial communities in the samples, such as the identification of various pathogens. Therefore, next-generation sequencing represents an important direction in the future.

The latest developments in sensor methods make field measurements possible so that the system can provide real-time infectious disease and public health information (see Figure 2\n).

There are several technologies that can be used to reduce sources of uncertainty related to population size, such as water chemistry parameters of mature analytical methods, which can help to estimate the population contributing to the catchment area of the wastewater collection points during a specific period of time[47, 48].

Furthermore, if it is linked to an effective response system, WBE can be helpful for epidemic surveillance. However, to effectively apply WBE to infectious disease monitoring and early warning, much work remains for implementation on a larger scale, and rapid progress is needed to address some of the key challenges mentioned above. This work requires the cooperation of various related research fields. SARS-CoV-2 will certainly not be the last novel virus to emerge and seriously damage global public health.
