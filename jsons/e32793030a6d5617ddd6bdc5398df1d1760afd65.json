Respirology 2006; 11: 715-722 Objective and background: Pathological changes in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) suggest that SARS sequelae are associated with dysregulation of cytokine and chemokine production. To improve understanding of the immuno-pathological processes involved in lung injury associated with SARS, the temporal changes in cytokine/chemokine profiles in the sera of SARS patients were compared with those of patients with community-acquired pneumonia (CAP), according to the degree of lung involvement. Methods: Serum levels of 11 cytokines and chemokines, in 14 patients with SARS and 24 patients with CAP, were serially checked using a bead-based multiassay system. Sera from 12 healthy subjects were used as normal controls. Results: The serum levels of interferon-\u03b3-inducible protein-10 (IP-10), IL-2 and IL-6 were significantly elevated during SARS infection. In patients with CAP, but not in those with SARS, the levels of interferon-\u03b3, IL-10, IL-8 and monokine induced by interferon-\u03b3 (MIG) were significantly elevated compared with the levels in healthy controls. Among the chemokines/cytokines, IL-6 levels correlated most strongly with radiographic scores (r = 0.62). The elevation of IP-10 and IL-2 antedated the development of chest involvement and reached peak levels earlier than the radiographic scores. In contrast, the dynamic changes in IL-6, C-reactive protein and neutrophils occurred synchronously with the changes in radiographic scores. The mean ratio of IL-6 to IL-10 in SARS patients (4.84; range 0.41-21) was significantly higher than that in CAP patients (2.95; range 0.02-10.57) (P = 0.04). Conclusions: The early induction of IP-10 and IL-2, as well as the subsequent over-production of IL-6 and lack of IL-10 production, probably contribute to the main immuno-pathological processes involved in lung injury in SARS. These changes in cytokine/chemokine profile are remarkably different from those observed in CAP patients.",

In common respiratory viral infections, such as respiratory syncytial virus or influenza, peak viral titres are usually reached within 2-3 days after the onset of symptoms. 31 The lack of antiviral cytokines, including interferons, probably allows a longer period for viral proliferation of up to 10 days in SARS-CoV infection.",

            "text": "IL-10, a highly potent anti-inflammatory cytokine, may suppress the production of several proinflammatory cytokines during acute lung injury, 18 including CAP. 22 In patients with ARDS, higher concentrations of IL-10 are associated with better survival. 32 Miyaoka et al. 33 studied patients after surgery and confirmed that a higher ratio of IL-6 to IL-10 was associated with more severe inflammation. No significant elevation of IL-10 in SARS patients was found, which is consistent with other investigations. 5, 16, 20 The ratio of IL-6 to IL-10 was also significantly elevated, but more in SARS patients than in CAP patients. Therefore, the lack of IL-10 production during SARS infection might favour a net proinflammatory condition, which contributes to the pathogenesis of lung injury and is associated with higher morbidity.",

Second, the patients with CAP were slightly older than the SARS patients, and there were more male patients. Although this difference was not statistically significant, it might also partly contribute to the cytokine/ chemokine response during illness. Third, the influence of immuno-suppressive therapy on the profile of cytokines/chemokines in SARS is still uncertain and requires further investigation. Fourth, almost all CAP patients developed pneumonia due to bacterial infection rather than a viral infection. Different pathogens have been known to trigger different cytokine/ chemokine profiles in CAP patients. Thus, it might be more informative to compare SARS patients with persons infected with other respiratory viruses rather than bacterial pathogens.",
