            "text": "A modern car offers many different safety and comfort functions. Most of them are nowadays realized in software running on a bunch of electronic control units (ECUs) with connected actuators and sensors. These ECUs are connected via several bus and network techniques like CAN, LIN, or FlexRay (depending on the needed band width and reliability). The avoidance of a single central unit is three-fold: First, the risks with a single-point of failure are reduced, second, the limited space and energy of a car restricts the possible technologies, and third, there is the constant need to balance the weight and space consumption of wiring harness with space and weight consumption of decentral control units that are placed nearby the actuators. Despite the pressure to realize more and more in software, some functions are still implemented in hardware. For example, in this specification it is assumed that the detection of a defective bulb is realized by a corresponding electronic circuit.",

For example, the rear direction indicator in USA and Canada is realized by a blinking red tail light, whereas in Europe it is an extra yellow light. Figure 1 presents an exemplary excerpt of a connection diagram for the two systems described in this case study. In this case study, we do not focus on the communication between the different ECUs which is necessary because of the distribution of each functionality over several ECUs. For example, to realize left blinking, the body controller front, the door control unit left, and the body controller rear must be involved to execute the commands given by the steering column switch module. In this case study, we focus on the functionalities and simplify reality by allowing signals to be read and commands to be sent directly. In order to save costs, the software of each control unit is parameterized with the different necessary configurations according to the country specification and the individual order. In the context of this case study, the following parameters are defined. They must be taken into account for the formal specification.",
