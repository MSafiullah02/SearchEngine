Pregnancy is a unique physiological condition, and is characterized by altered immunity and elevated hormone levels to actively tolerate the semiallogeneic fetus, which undergoes a sudden and substantial fluctuation during the immediate postpartum period. Changes in clinical features, laboratory characteristics, and imaging features of pregnant women during the pre-partum and postpartum periods require further elucidation. Here, we retrospectively analyzed the clinical features, laboratory characteristics, and imaging features of eight pregnant cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection during the pre-partum and post-partum periods. Our results showed that four of the eight pregnant women were asymptomatic before delivery but became symptomatic post-partum. Correspondingly, white blood cell (WBC) counts increased and lymphocyte (LYMPH) counts decreased. C-reactive protein (CRP) levels in the serum also increased to a higher level than those in general pregnancy. Therefore, it is imperative to closely monitor laboratory parameters including the WBC count, LYMPH count, and CRP, along with other imaging features in chest CT scans, to promptly prevent, diagnose, and treat a SARS-CoV-2 infection during pregnancy.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Since the first report of pneumonia associated with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China in December 2019, the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic has become a major public health challenge in China and other countries (Huang et al. 2020; Hui et al. 2020; Lu et al. 2020) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 263, "end": 282, "text": "(Huang et al. 2020;", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 283, "end": 299, "text": "Hui et al. 2020;", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 300, "end": 315, "text": "Lu et al. 2020)", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "People of all ages are susceptible to SARS-CoV-2; however, current data have confirmed that adults, specifically older men with comorbidities, are more likely to be affected, suffering subsequently from severe pneumonia, pulmonary edema, acute respiratory distress syndrome, multiple organ failure, and death (Chen N et al. 2020; Huang et al. 2020; Wang et al. 2020) .
