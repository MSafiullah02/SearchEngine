As expected, the majority of identifiable spectra from M. musculus blood were derived from subunits \uf061 and \uf062 of hemoglobin, serum albumin, \uf062-globin, and fibrinogen in addition to a few other proteins ( Supplementary Fig. S1 ). Interestingly, over 80% of the spectra could not be identified to the M. musculus proteome despite the completeness of the protein sequence database.

Note that this dataset dot product measures the similarity of two datasets, and is similar in formula but different in concept from the spectral dot product, which measures the similarity of two spectra. This dot product SDSS accounts for the quantitative information in matching fingerprints. Namely, spectra that are more frequently found in the dataset used to build the library are also expected to be more frequently found in the query dataset. This score will therefore reward similar quantitative profiles of the library and query dataset, and penalized dissimilar profiles.

This suggests that the quantitative information afforded by spectral counts appears to augment the discriminating power, although for these datasets, the quantitative information was not absolutely necessary, as the binary-transformed SDSS was also sufficiently discriminating. This is understandable, because distinguishing between blood samples of different organisms probably relies more on sequence differences of detected peptides and thus qualitatively different spectra, than on the quantities of identical peptides in the sample. However, the quantitative information may be more useful in other biological sample fingerprinting applications, such as distinguishing different samples from the same organism (e.g. different tissues, different biological states).",

Removing multipleorganism spectra should expectedly elevate the importance of the matches to library spectra that can unambiguously identify the sample source. However, this scoring function may not be as appropriate when the library contains several phylogenetically close animals. In this hypothetical case, many library spectra will be shared among multiple species, and removing all of them may not be advisable. For instance, in the present study, a large fraction of spectra found in the lion can also be found in the tiger. While one can still distinguish between these two cats using the \"unique-dot\" score, there may be cases where discarding all shared spectra removes too much information, to the point that even the ability to distinguish a cat and a non-cat is lost. The \"dot\" score, on the other hand, retains these shared spectra, and therefore will not be affected by the composition of the library. Based on these results, the \"unique dot\" score is chosen as the SDSS function used for blood meal identification as described in the main text.",

The results show that identification of the source of the blood meal from engorged larval ticks was effective using methods based on detecting specific blood proteins by sequence searching algorithms (Supplementary Table S1 ). Similar to the results of the proteomic profiling method, larval ticks that had fed upon S. carolinensis could also be identified as ticks that had fed upon T. striatus if S. carolinensis hemoglobin sequences are not included in the database. However, identification of the source of the blood meal from molted nymphal ticks was less effective when peptide identification relied upon de novo sequenced hemoglobin subunits (Supplementary Table S2 ), failing to identify the correct source of the blood meal from two ticks that had fed on a lab mouse, both ticks that had fed on a chipmunk, and 4 of the 6 ticks that had fed on white-footed mice.

Only spectra meeting all the following criteria are kept: precursor m/z being greater than 350 Th, the range of fragment m/z (i.e. m/z difference between heaviest and lightest fragment) being greater than 350 Th, having at least 35 peaks, and having at least 5% of the total intensity at above the precursor m/z.
