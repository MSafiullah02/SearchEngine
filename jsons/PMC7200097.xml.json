On April 8, members of ultra-right-wing parties organized YouTube demonstrations, calling for government\u2019s immediate dismissal after the end of the state of emergency; their claim was supported by estimated 450.000 people (Portillo 2020). One day later, the Union of Actors and Actresses complained to the Ministry of Culture about their lack of support to cultural sector and organized a cultural strike by symbolic network \u2018blackout\u2019: participants agreed to neither share nor consume cultural content from 23:59 on Thursday April 9 until 23:59 on Saturday April 11 (Archyde 2020; Spain News 2020).",

Conspiracy theories that incriminate, stereotype or bias, are used across the ideological spectrum. Companies monetize global panic and endanger public safety by increasing prices of necessary products (World Health Organization 2020b).

Covid-19 is a practical case in the point for the well-known theoretical idea: in order to build a solidary, social, and ecological future, we need a fundamentally different kind of economics (Mair 2020). In order to mitigate impacts of the coronavirus, Spain could be the first country in Europe introducing Universal Basic Income on a long-term basis (Ng 2020). The general secretary of the government argues that such a measure would imply that households deprived of income as a result of this crisis would receive financial aid (see Mason 2020). Alongside other measures, such as pausing mortgage payments (Togoh 2020), Universal Basic Income could be a decisive policy for economic recovery after the lockdown. Despite public requests, similar Universal Basic Income initiative has been rejected in the UK, whose government believes that its investments in welfare state are sufficient (Ng 2020).",

Struggling with our own reality, we leave other people behind as if their reality is not a direct consequence of ours. At the Communiars Collective,1 we run a cooperation project between University of Sevilla and the non-governmental organization Open Cultural Center2 in Polykastro (Greece). Within this project, I had a chance to experience inhuman and miserable life in the Moria refugee camp in Greece. With 18,000 people staying in a facility built for 3000 people (Eldin 2020), self-isolation in Moria is impossible. Now that the coronavirus is at their doorstep, people are trying to protect themselves producing their own masks and preparing for the worst.",

While this is a nice gesture which should not be under-valued, there are more than 42,000 people living in overcrowded camps and about 10% of them are minors (The Associated Press 2020). These people live under unbearable conditions, and waves of anti-migrant violence deprive them from their last glimpses of human dignity: clothing and food (Fallon and Grant 2020). With restrictive migration measures promoted throughout Europe, they need to choose between returning to an almost certain death and trying to survive at the gates of what they see as a dignified and humane future. From this perspective, solidarity implies much more than humanitarian aid; it requires a recognition that we are all equal, and that our struggles are common. According to Paulo Freire, \u2018the true generosity consists precisely in fighting to destroy the causes which nourish false charity. False charity constrains the fearful and subdued, the \u201crejects of life\u201d, to extend their trembling hands.\u2019 (Freire 1970: 45).",

According to Freire (1970: 43), \u2018concern for humanization leads at once to the recognition of dehumanization\u2019; we now have a historic chance to decide \u2018between being spectators or actors\u2019 and \u2019speaking out or being silent\u2019 (48). Chomsky (2020) advises that this is the moment to reflect on our educational system, which is a triage in its own right, where some contents and voices prevail over other contents and voices. As academics and educators, we have an important responsibility: instead of returning to old \u2018normality,\u2019 we need to create a new reality where true interdependence is recognized and solidarity remains true to its essence. Teaching in the age of Covid-19 is an opportunity to advocate for this new social order. So let us grab this opportunity and start working together!",
