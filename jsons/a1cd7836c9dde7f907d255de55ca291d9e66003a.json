METHODS: Forty preterm neonates with RDS were compared with another 40 preterm neonates without RDS enrolled as controls. Total antioxidant capacity (TAC), malondialdehyde (MDA), advanced oxidation protein products (AOPPs), 8-hydroxy-2deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), and trace elements (copper and zinc) were measured in cord blood (day 0) for all neonates and repeated on day 3 for the RDS group. RESULTS: Day 0 serum levels of MDA, AOPPs, and 8-OHdG were significantly higher in neonates with RDS than controls with a further increase on day 3. Days 0 and 3 levels of TAC, copper, and zinc were significantly lower in the RDS group compared with controls. Elevated serum levels of 8-OHdG and AOPPs were associated with severe RDS, invasive mechanical ventilation, and high mortality rate. 8-OHdG and AOPPs were positively correlated with MDA, oxygenation index, duration of ventilation, and duration of hospitalization. CONCLUSIONS: Increased lipid, protein, and DNA oxidation is accompanied by alterations in the antioxidant defense status, which may play a role in the pathogenesis and severity of RDS.",

            "text": "Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in premature infants. 1 Newborns and particularly preterm infants are at high risk of oxidative stress and are susceptible to free radical oxidative damage. 2, 3 The pathogenesis of oxidative stress in RDS is based on the rapid formation of the reactive oxygen species (ROS), which overcome the capacity of the antioxidative defense system. 4 ROS can cause damage to a variety of cellular molecules, including lipids, proteins, and DNA, which results in cell injury and may induce respiratory cell death. 5, 6 ROS also interact with pulmonary surfactant, thus delaying the normal functioning of the lung. 5 This process can contribute to the pathogenesis of RDS and very likely leads to severe RDS. 7 ROS have been implicated in the molecular damage seen in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid of patients with RDS. BAL fluid normally contains a large amount of the antioxidant glutathione; but in patients with RDS, it is mostly in the oxidized form. Hydrogen peroxide was detected in the expired air of RDS patients. 4 Moreover, in neonates with RDS and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), lipid hydroperoxide is increased and glutathione concentrations are decreased in BAL fluid. 8 Malondialdehyde (MDA) is one of the most frequently used indicators of the overall lipid peroxidation. 9 Advanced oxidation protein products (AOPPs) is a protein oxidation biomarker, which originates under oxidative and carbonyl stress and increases global inflammatory activity. 10, 11 8-Hydroxy-2-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) is a commonly used marker of oxidative stress-derived DNA damage. 12, 13 Total antioxidant capacity (TAC) evaluates the overall antioxidant status resulting from antioxidant production and consumption in response to oxidative stress. 14 Thus, TAC provides an integrated parameter rather than the simple sum of measurable antioxidants. 15 Trace elements such as copper, manganese, selenium, and zinc act as cofactors of antioxidant enzymes to protect the body from oxygen free radicals that are produced during oxidative stress. It is necessary to maintain a balance between the harmful pro-oxidant components produced and the antioxidant compounds that counter these effects. 16 Identification of the potential biomarkers of oxidative stress in RDS that could monitor disease progression represents a promising challenge. To test the hypothesis that the presence of oxidant-antioxidant imbalance in preterm neonates contributes to the development and severity of RDS, this study assessed lipid peroxidation, protein oxidation, and oxidative DNA damage in relation to neonatal RDS severity.",

Logistic regression analysis was performed with estimating the odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) to define predictors of RDS severity. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to determine the best cutoff values of AOPPs and 8-OHdG that could predict RDS severity and mortality with the highest balanced sensitivity and specificity.

This difference could be explained by the fact that the risk of RDS is inversely proportional to gestational age and birth weight; RDS occurs in approximately 5% of near-term infants, 30% of infants <30 weeks gestational age, and 60% of premature infants <28 weeks gestational age. 24 Gestational age is considered as an independent predictor of RDS. 25 Moreover, in a report from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Neonatal Research Network, the incidence of RDS was 44% in infants weighing 501-1500 g, with 71% reported in infants weighing 501-750 g, 54% reported in infants weighing 751-1000 g, 36% reported in infants weighing 1001-1250 g, and 22% reported in infants weighing 1251-1500 g. 26 In the study by Negi et al., 5 gestational age and birth weight were higher in control group than neonates with RDS. Several reports discussed oxidative stress in preterm infants; 7,14,27 however, few studies have addressed the role of oxidative stress in pathogenesis of RDS. 5, 28 In this context, Negi et al. 5 found convincing evidence of oxidative damage and diminished antioxidant defense in newborns with RDS.

These levels showed further increase at day 3 compared to day 0. Few studies reported that 8-OHdG 5 and protein carbonyl, 5, 30, 31 another marker for protein oxidation, were elevated in neonates with RDS compared to controls. This oxidative protein and DNA damage has been suggested to be one of the contributing factors to the pathogenesis of neonatal RDS. 5, 32 Our results suggest that the severity of oxidative stress correlates with the severity of RDS; we observed that AOPPs and 8-OHdG levels on day 0 and day 3 were significantly higher in neonates with RDS grades III and IV compared with those having RDS grade II. Logistic regression analysis showed that these biomarkers were significant independent variables related to RDS severity and the cutoff for prediction of RDS severity was determined. In our study, day 3 AOPP levels were higher among patients who received surfactant. Furthermore, levels of AOPPs and 8-OHdG were increased among RDS patients who needed invasive mechanical ventilation support and were also higher in those who died. We found significant relations between the two markers and oxygenation index, duration of ventilation, and duration of hospitalization. The increase in levels of oxidative stress biomarkers on day 3 with increasing the severity of RDS and the use of invasive mechanical ventilation could be related to the use of exogenous oxygen. This points out to the deleterious effects of hyperoxia. There exist, however, several potential causes of intra-and extracellular oxidant stress in the preterm newborns with RDS. The high inspiratory concentrations of oxygen required to achieve adequate arterial oxygenation and pro-oxidant drugs (e.g., non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) can all promote ROS accumulation and the utilization and depletion of antioxidative factors. 4 Joung et al. 33 reported that 8-OHdG measured on day 3 was correlated with the duration of mechanical ventilation. In this context, Dursun et al. 34 stated that mechanical ventilation and CPAP can induce oxidative stress. These findings support those reported by Falk et al., 35 who found that mechanical ventilation can induce oxidative stress, which plays a critical role in the occurrence of pulmonary injury in intubated neonates. Moreover, Gladstone and Levine 36 found that the amount of oxidatively modified protein may provide a quantitative assessment of oxygen toxicity. Gitto et al. 4 suggested that hyperoxic exposure itself, although essential for the survival of RDS infants, probably induces excessive production of ROS in the respiratory system.",

Buonocore et al. 32 observed a positive correlation between AOPPs and total hydroperoxide (a derivative of lipid peroxidation). This implies that the oxidative stress damage is a parallel process involving both lipids and proteins proportionately.",

An experimental model by Sarricolea et al. 39 has been developed to investigate the effect of copper deficiency on lung maturity in the newborn rat. A greater thickness of the air-blood barrier was observed in the lungs of the copper-deficient group, which might explain the RDS observed in this group.",

AOPPs and 8-OHdG could be used as serum biomarkers for oxidative stress among neonates with RDS to monitor disease progression. Maternal antenatal steroid intake and limiting the exposure of the preterm infants to oxygen at high concentration and high positive pressure during ventilation might decrease the risk of oxidative stress among neonates with RDS. Investigating the relation between the studied markers and proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-8, as well as other markers of oxidative stress, are warranted.",
