In the series of Lewis et al., 6 a viral cause was suggested in a further 21% of the children by the detection of interferon in their serum, increasing the proportion to 84%. It may be that viral invasion of the central nervous system is always present in patients with febrile convulsions, but because of the limitations in our diagnostic methods we are unable to identify it. Common respiratory viruses, such as rhinovirus and coronaviruses, were not included in our virologic battery of tests. 23, 24 Bacterial infection as the sole cause was apparent in only nine of the 144 patients; in addition, there were two examples of pneumococcal and one of meningococcal sepsis, three patients with mycoplasma infection, and three with urinary tract infection.

A diagnosis of virus infection was verified in 46% of the former patients and 53% of the latter. Three adenoviruses, one parainfluenza virus type 2 and one type 3, one respiratory syncytial virus, one echovirus type 11, one herpes simplex virus type 2, and one influenza B virus were isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid. A simple febrile convulsion occurred in seven children with a positive cerebrospinal fluid viral isolation, and two had a complex febrile seizure. In a follow-up of 2 to 4 years (mean 3.3 years), 21 of the 107 children with simple seizures (19.6%) and 3 of the 32 children with complicated seizures (9.4%) had recurrent febrile seizures. The children with positive evidence for a viral infection, even with a virus isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid, had no more recurrences than those without any proven viral infection. We conclude that children with a proven viral infection have no worse prognosis than those without. (J PEDIATR 1990;116:195-9)",
