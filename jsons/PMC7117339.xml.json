N also has been proved to regulate the host immune response (Yu et al., 2017).Further study has suggested that the N protein is a multiphosphorylation protein (Wootton et al., 2002). It contains at least two phosphorylation modification sites. Mutation of those sites could impair the viral replication ability in Marc-145 cells (Chen et al., 2018a; 2018b). However, whether the mutation could impair PRRSV virulence to piglets requires further investigation.In this study, we found that the mutations could impair PRRSV replication ability in porcine primary macrophages (PAMs). The animal experiments indicated that the pathogenicity of the mutated virus (A105-120) was significantly lower than parent strain (XH-GD). Our results suggested that the phosphorylation of the N protein contributes to virus replication and virulence.The results are also beneficial to find a novel way to attenuate the virus.",

In this study, viruses were incubated with the PAMs at an MOI of 0.1. Viral titres were calculated by the Reed-Muench method. As shown in Fig. 1\n, the titre of XH-GD was always higher than that of the other mutated viruses at 12\u201336 hpi. XH-GD reached the maximum titre at 36 hpi, which is faster than the other viruses. Compared with XH-GD, A105 and A120, A105-120 showed lower viral growth at 24\u201336 hpi. There were significant differences between XH-GD and A105-120 at 24 hpi and 36 hpi (P < 0.01) (Fig. 1A). The Nsp9 gene real-time PCR results were similar with growth curve (Fig. 1B).

            "text": "There are many pathogens that have serious effects on society in the Nidovirales order, such as MEAR, SARS, IBV, PEDV and PRRSV (de Wilde et al., 2018). The N proteins of those viruses have a common origin (Yu et al., 2006). Therefore, investigating the function of the N protein of PRRSV will help to understand the role of the N protein in the Nidovirales life cycle. The N protein of PRRSV, a phosphorylated protein, is important for the viral life cycle. A previous study showed that mutated phosphorylation modification sites could impair growth in vitro (Chen et al., 2018a; 2018b). Since PAMs cells were the target cell of PRRSV in the lung (Burkard et al., 2017; Shabir et al., 2018), they were used to confirm the effect of the mutations. The growth curve results showed that the mutations could also regulate the replication ability in PAMs. We confirmed once again that phosphorylation modification of the N protein could regulate PRRSV replication.",

The emergence of recombinant viruses has exacerbated this problem (Liu et al., 2017; Zhou et al., 2018, 2015). The N protein is the most conserved protein in PRRSV, and few sites have changed during passaging in vitro (Chen et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2014).
