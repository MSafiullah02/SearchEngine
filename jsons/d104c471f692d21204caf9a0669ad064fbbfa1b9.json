The current study aimed to develop and validate a scale (the Mental Health Professional Stigma Scale; MHPSS) for this purpose. Methods The MHPSS and related measures were completed by 221 Australian MHPs via online survey, with a subsample completing the MHPSS again 2 weeks after initial completion. Results Exploratory factor analysis revealed a four-factor solution, comprising of 13 items and accounting for 50.16% of variance. Factors were Perceived Other Stigma, Perceived Structural Stigma, Personal Stigma, and Self stigma. The internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and validity of the scale were supported. Conclusions The MHPSS has utility to capture stigmatising attitudes and beliefs related to occupational stress and burnout among MHPs. It may be used to assist in the development and evaluation of initiatives to reduce stigma and increase helpseeking among MHPs.",

            "text": "The prevalence and impact of stress and burnout in mental health professionals (MHPs) are well-documented [1] , with an average of 40% experiencing high emotional exhaustion [2] . In addition to the occupational stressors experienced by other health professionals, such as time pressure, workload, and ongoing contact with the physical and emotional pain of others [3, 4] MHPs also encounter additional unique stressors, such as greater probability of difficult interactions with patients and families, patient suicide, and the stigma associated with the field [5] . The prevalence of burnout among mental health professionals (MHPs) has been estimated at between 21 and 67% [1] . However, help-seeking among MHPs remains low [6] , with stigma (e.g., fear of colleagues finding out about their difficulties) emerging as a key barrier preventing MHPs from seeking help [6] . Research in this field has been hampered by a lack of psychometrically valid tools to measure stigma of occupational stress and burnout among MHPs. Such a tool would allow for more rigorous measurement and understanding of this construct, as well as for the accurate assessment of interventions to reduce stigma among MHPs.",

[23] suggest a culture of nondisclosure exists within the mental health profession, and that this non-disclosure works to increase stigma among MHPs. Registration requirements concerning professional impairment and mandatory reporting may contribute to this culture of non-disclosure within the professions [6, 24] . Di Benedetto [25] suggests that implicit in legal and ethical mandates for the mental health profession is the faulty notion that MHPs should be immune to mental health problems. Fears of career and organisational repercussions from disclosing difficulties, negative views from and toward colleagues experiencing difficulties, and the view that as health professionals one should be able to manage such difficulties without external intervention are reported to perpetuate stigma within the field [26] . These concerns map directly to issues of public, personal, self, and structural stigma within the MHP field, and suggest there are unique aspects to the experience of stigma within this population. However, to date stigma has primarily been measured using general stigma scales.",

Current instruments are inadequate to capture this phenomenon largely due to the broad label of mental illness and the focus of most measures on only one type of stigma. Furthermore, these measures are often focused on how MHPs might stigmatise their patients, rather than focusing within the profession [27] . To improve help-seeking in this population, there is a need to understand the effects and interrelationships of these types of stigma together, in particular the effects of structural stigma which is often omitted in scales of stigma for MHPs [28] [29] [30] . The Stigma of Occupational Stress Scale for Doctors (SOSS-D) does measure these attitudinal barriers to help-seeking and has demonstrated strong psychometric properties and structural validity [26] . However, the SOSS-D only targets three of the four facets of stigma (perceived other stigma, perceived structural stigma, and personal stigma) and was developed for use only among medical practitioners. Although there is overlap between the occupational groupings, the differences in training, job roles, and professional culture between medical and the broader MHP populations suggests the need for a measure specifically for use among MHPs.",

Two mental health experts reviewed these items, and selected four of the ten items as being relevant, as well as suggesting an additional two self-stigma items. The modified scale was provided to a panel of current mental health professionals, comprised of seven professionals with backgrounds in clinical psychology, social work, occupational therapy, and mental health nursing.

These items related to broad conceptualisations of stigma within the workplace rather than specifically from either managers of colleagues. A recommendation to duplicate items as pertaining to either managers or colleagues was made during the MHP panel feedback stage of scale development. However, the decision was made to keep these items relating to the workplace more broadly due to concerns that items specific to the role of management may not be relevant for the significant proportion of MHPs who work in solo private practice settings within the Australian context (e.g., 24.7% of psychiatrists, 21.1% of psychologists, [40] ). It should be noted though, that whilst this decision was made for pragmatic reasons, it does have implications for the conceptualisation of structural stigma provided by the scale. Future versions of the scale could look at revisions to these items to better differentiate between stigma from specific sources within the workplace, and would likely provide greater insight into these issues for MHPs. As a preliminary tool though, the structural validity of the broader conceptualisation of structural stigma was supported in the current version.",

Partial support for this hypothesis was found. A significant moderate positive correlation was found between the OMSHC, a measure of stigmatising attitudes and behaviours in health care professionals, and the MHPSS total scale, Personal, and Self Stigma subscales. Although the Perceived Other and Perceived Structural subscales showed weaker correlations, these were still in the expected direction and logical given the OMSHC does not contain items corresponding to these constructs [32] . The PDD, which measured the extent to which respondents believe most other people hold stigmatising attitudes towards people with mental illness, had a significant weak positive relationship with the MHPSS total scale. A weak but significant correlation was also found between the PDD and the Perceived Other Subscale of the MHPSS, with other subscales demonstrating very weak relationships. Although the relationships were weaker than expected, the pattern provides support for the convergent validity of the MHPSS, in particular with the Perceived Other Stigma subscale and PDD measuring similar constructs. The weaker strength may be accounted for by the PDD being developed on a general population sample and also referring to the broader \"mental illness\" term rather than stress and burnout specifically. As such, although the convergent validity relationships were weaker than expected, the pattern provides confidence that the MHPSS is measuring the intended concepts. The divergent validity of the MHPSS was supported by weak positive correlations between the scale and psychological distress (K10). This relationship indicated that as expected, the MHPSS shared only a small amount of variance with psychological distress. This overlap could be explained by the potential for stigma to exacerbate distress and deter help seeking, which in turn can increase distress.",

In assessing for stigma among this population, we have not provided guidance for users of the MHPSS on cutoffs or score bands to indicate problematic levels of stigmatised beliefs. Similar to conceptualisations of the broader barriers to care concept (e.g., [43] ), we expect that stigmatised beliefs will likely have a cumulative effect, with greater endorsement of stigmatised beliefs being associated with reduced likelihood of disclosure or help-seeking. However, it is also possible that endorsement of a single stigmatised belief (for example, relating to potential discrimination in the workplace), when of significant distress may be sufficient to preventing help-seeking. As such, use of the scale may provide insight into overall patterns of beliefs and relative endorsement of stigma, although clinical attention should also be paid to the relationship each belief has with helpseeking for the individual. To this end, the scale may be useful in assessing macro level patterns of stigma in populations and workplaces, as well as understanding an individual's potential barriers to treatment seeking. Tailored individual and group level interventions may then be developed to target salient stigmatised beliefs and challenge potential cultural issues within professions and workplaces. We believe that the MHPSS may be a valuable tool to contribute to the emerging empirical knowledge base on stigmatising attitudes and perceptions of occupational stress and burnout among MHPs.",
