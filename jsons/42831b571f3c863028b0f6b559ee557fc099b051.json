We found significant non-random structure in the lion-pathogen co-occurrence network and identified potential facilitative and competitive interactions between acute and chronic pathogens.

Individuals are often co-infected by a diverse infra-community of pathogens, and interactions between pathogens can both alter infection dynamics (Cattadori et al. 2008; Susi et al. 2015) and influence disease outcomes (Moss et al. 2008; Munson et al. 2008; Wejse et al. 2015) . Pathogens that form chronic, long-lasting infections are ubiquitous and are likely to overlap pathogens that produce short-lasting acute infections (Fenton 2008; Randall et al. 2013; Rynkiewicz et al. 2015; Aivelo & Norberg 2018) . Chronic pathogens can compete for the same resources as acute pathogens and can reduce the likelihood of infection (Randall et al. 2013; Budischak et al. 2018) or, conversely, facilitate infection via immune suppression (e.g., Geldmacher & Koup 2012) .",

This is particularly the case for microparasites where pathogen detection often relies on serology, and, thus, without resampling the same individual, the precise timing of exposure cannot be estimated. Detection of chronic pathogens may be more straightforward as the infection is active for more extended periods, but deducing pathogen interactions is difficult without extensive longitudinal data (Tompkins et al. 2011; Fenton et al. 2014) . Identifying whether two pathogens interact due to host-habitat preferences, the increasing likelihood of exposure with age, or infra-community processes such as competition is methodologically challenging (Poulin 2007; Johnson & Buller 2011; Fenton et al. 2014; Clark et al. 2016) .",

For example, pathogen associations in amphibian communities differed substantially at the host scale compared to the pond scale, but these effects can be reversed or undetected at other scales (Stutz et al. 2018) . In general, interactions between free-living species are more apparent at scales Although pathogen co-occurrence networks are valuable for quantifying broad structural patterns, they do not account for environmental or host factors or differences in spatial or temporal scale. Joint species distribution models fill this gap by simultaneously assessing environmental influences and interspecific co-occurrences across multiple scales using hierarchical Bayesian mixed models (Warton et al. 2015; Ovaskainen et al. 2017 ). Here we use both co-occurrence network and joint species distribution models to examine the structure of pathogen-pathogen networks and quantify pathogen associations whilst controlling for environmental and host factors. We collate ten years of data on acute and chronic pathogens in 105 African lions (Panthera leo) as well as extensive host and environmental data from the Serengeti Lion Project (SLP, Packer et al. 2005) . The SLP datasets provides a unique opportunity to understand pathogen co-occurrence networks in a wild population whilst controlling for group, individual and environmental characteristics.

Feline coronavirus can have both acute and chronic forms and it is impossible to assess which form the individual was exposed to from serological data, but based on age-prevalence relationships we categorized it as a chronic infection (Fig. S1 ). As most individual lions were likely to be infected by chronic infections within the first two years after birth (Troyer et al. 2011, Fig . S1), we assume that acute exposure typically occurred whilst the individual was infected by the chronic pathogen. We then partitioned the chronic pathogen data into two sets based on taxonomic resolution (high and medium).

Even though B. gibsoni and B. felis show similar age prevalence profiles (Fig. S1 ), the prevalence of B. felis over time was relatively stable compared to the other protozoa (Fig. S10) . Differences in the host range for individual Babesia species and potential host differences in virulence may partially explain these patterns. For example, B. felis has only ever been detected in felids, whereas B. gibsoni has a much broader host range including canids (Penzhorn 2006 ).

The inability to distinguish mortality from competitive interactions is one of them, and careful interpretation of negative associations is necessary. Incorporating approaches such as structural equation models that explicitly include potential mechanisms that underly candidate pathogen interactions (Carver et al. 2015) could be a valuable additional step in future pathogen network studies. Another weakness is the inability to estimate the timing of these infections more precisely. For example, the negative association between RVF and H. felis could be due to differences in rainfall affecting vector abundance with higher rainfall years increase mosquito abundance thus increasing RVF prevalence (Fig. S2 ). In contrast, low rainfall years increase the risk of lions being exposed to ticks (Munson et al. 2008) thus potentially increasing H. felis prevalence. As rainfall was calibrated to the age of sampling rather than the age of infection (which could differ) the JSDM approach could not capture this variation. Furthermore, we cannot quantify the importance of these associations in shaping pathogen distribution across scales compared to processes such as host density. Also, the number of samples we had did differ across years (Table S1 ) with most coming between 1985 and 1994, and this have influenced some patterns, particularly between genotypes. Lastly, incorporating immune function and host resources in both the summary network and JSDM analyses are likely to provide mechanistic insight into pathogen network structure (Griffiths et al. 2014) .
