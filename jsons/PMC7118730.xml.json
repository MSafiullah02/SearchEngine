            "text": "Attaching-effacing (AE) bacteria are so-called because they are capable of forming AE lesions on the intestinal mucosa in vivo and on certain tissues and cell cultures in vitro. The mucosal lesion is associated with stunting and fusion of villi in severe cases (Fig. 1\na). Bacteria can be seen on the mucosal surface (Fig. 1b), and may often be specifically identified by immunolabelling (Fig. 1c). With transmission electron microscopy (Fig.1d), the AE lesion is seen to be characterized by intimate adhesion of the bacterium to the epithelial cell membrane, with an intervening gap of approximately 10 nm, accompanied by effacement of enterocyte microvilli. Beneath the adherent bacterium a cytoskeletal rearrangement, including the accumulation of filamentous actin (F-actin), is seen. The bacteria often rest upon a pedestal-like structure, which may extend for up to 10 \u03bcm away from the epithelial cell surface (Kaper et al., 1998). The first description and illustration of the AE lesion, although not referred to as such at that time, was from neonatal piglets inoculated with a human strain of Escherichia coli (Staley et al., 1969). Takeuchi et al. (1978) described in detail a similar lesion from rabbits inoculated with RDEC-1, a strain of E. coli associated with diarrhoea in rabbits. The term \u201cattaching-effacing\u201d was first used by Moon et al. (1983) in describing the same type of lesion induced experimentally in the intestines of pigs and rabbits.",

Vero toxins are encoded by temperate bacteriophages and are potent ribosomal inhibitors, targeting blood vessels and other tissues, depending upon the distribution of toxin receptors in the host species (O'Loughlin and Robins-Browne, 2001, Paton and Paton, 1998). EPEC strains produce AE lesions in the small and large intestine (Ulshen and Rollo, 1980, Rothbaum et al., 1982); they do not produce VT and are now mainly associated with infant diarrhoea in developing countries (Nataro and Kaper, 1998). EHEC produce VT and are associated with haemorrhagic colitis and the haemolytic-uraemic syndrome (HUS) (Nataro and Kaper, 1998). E. coli O157:H7 is the prototype EHEC; it forms AE lesions on animal intestinal mucosa (Tzipori et al., 1986), and in-vitro studies (Phillips et al., 2000) suggested that human intestinal mucosa was similarly affected. Such lesions may assist colonization of the human large intestine. The designations EPEC and EHEC were developed in the context of observed clinical disorders; their definition and their usage in relation to individual bacterial strains and to virulence factors has varied, both over time and between workers. For example, the designation \u201cEHEC\u201d in a communication may or may not infer an established association between the strain in question and the clinical entities of haemorrhagic diarrhoea and HUS. Furthermore, some disease-associated EHEC strains lack an AE capability (Willshaw et al., 1992).",

            "text": "An early non-intimate attachment (Fig. 2a) appears to be necessary for initial signalling leading to the development of the AE lesion, but the mediators of this attachment are poorly understood. Studies have shown a potentiating effect of adhesion factors (such as the EPEC Adherence Factor [EAF] plasmid and the REPEC-associated AF/R1 fimbrial adhesin) upon AE lesion formation in vitro (Knutton et al., 1987, Francis et al., 1991) and on AEEC virulence in vivo (Levine et al., 1985, Wolf et al., 1988). The EAF plasmid contains a gene cluster (bfp) encoding bundle-forming pili (BFP) (Stone et al., 1996), which mediate microcolony formation in culture and localized adhesion to HEp-2 cells (Giron et al., 1991). However, the role of BFP in vivo is still unclear, as adhesion of EPEC to human duodenal and jejunal organ cultures appeared to be independent of EAF or BFP (Knutton et al., 1991, Hicks et al., 1998). EspA filaments (see Stage 2 below and Fig. 2a) may act as an adhesin, with evidence for this in EPEC (Knutton et al., 1998, Daniell et al., 2001b) and EHEC O157:H7 (Tatsuno et al., 2000). Components of the LEE, including intimin and Tir, which are directly involved in intimate attachment, appeared to be important for primary adhesion and microcolony formation by EHEC O157:H7 in vitro (McKee et al., 1995, DeVinney et al., 1999, Tatsuno et al., 2000), and for detectable adhesion of a REPEC strain in vivo (Marches et al., 2000), but intimin-deficient mutants nonetheless adhere diffusely in vitro (Tatsuno et al., 2000).",

This is encoded on the LEE by sep (secretion of E. coli proteins) and esc (E. coli secretion) genes (Elliott et al., 1998). The LEE encodes several secreted proteins, termed EPEC-secreted proteins (Esp), three of which (A, B and D) are essential for normal AE lesion formation. EspA forms filaments on the bacterial surface, in an EspD-dependent process (Knutton et al., 1998), and these filaments adhere to host cells (Shaw et al., 2002). EspD also participates in forming pores in the host cell membrane (Daniell et al., 2001a). EspB is translocated to the host cell in an EspA-dependent manner (Ebel et al., 1998, Knutton et al., 1998), and is distributed in the plasma membrane and the cytosol of the host cell (Wolff et al., 1998).",

These cytoskeletal changes are associated with the effacement of microvilli, the formation of pedestals topped by attached bacteria, and the disruption of the intestinal barrier function of enterocytes (Simonovic et al., 2001). The mechanisms by which cytoskeletal elements are dissolved and reaggregated are unclear. Current models implicate translocated bacterial proteins such as EspB and Tir, which are co-localized at the site of cytoskeletal reorganization, together with activation of host cell protein kinase activity (Frankel et al., 1998b). EPEC Tir appears to interact with the cytoskeletal elements in at least two different ways: it binds \u03b1-actinin directly (Goosney et al., 2000) but also acts via the Nck protein, neural Wiskott\u2013Aldrich syndrome proteins (N-WASP) and the actin-related protein complex (Arp2/3c) to focus (nucleate) actin, promoting its polymerization (Kalman et al., 1999, Gruenheid et al., 2001). This latter process is dependent upon phosphorylation of tyrosine residue 474 in the EPEC Tir molecule (Kenny, 1999), but appears to be significantly different in EHEC O157:H7 lesions, where a serine residue occupies position 474 in Tir and tyrosine phosphorylation does not occur (Ismaili et al., 1995a).",

Intimin subtype may confer tissue tropism upon AEEC, as reflected in the different intestinal regions affected by EPEC and EHEC (Tzipori et al., 1995). As the intimin receptor Tir is not a host protein, tissue tropism may be determined by the c-lectin-like binding site on intimin; however, binding of c-lectins by intimin in the conventional manner seems improbable (Luo et al., 2000). Intimin type seems unlikely to be the sole determinant of the distribution of AE lesions, as human EPEC strains O127:H6 and O55:H6, both of which encode \u03b1-intimin and BFP, differ in their tropism on human intestine in organ culture (Fitzhenry et al., 2002). Frankel et al. (1996a) suggested that intimin may bind cells in a non-Tir-dependent manner by association with \u03b2-integrins.",

The invasiveness of EPEC in vitro may rival that exhibited by enteroinvasive E. coli (Donnenberg et al., 1989), Salmonella enterica serotype Typhimurium (Geyid et al., 1996) and Shigella flexneri (McKee and O'Brien, 1995). However, marked variation in the extent of invasion has been observed between EPEC strains, and with different combinations of strain and host cell type (Geyid et al., 1996, Dibb-Fuller et al., 2001). EHEC strains may invade in vitro but generally to a lesser extent than EPEC (Ismaili et al., 1998). Intracytoplasmic bacteria (both in vacuoles and free within the cytoplasm) have been observed in AE lesions due to EPEC and EPEC-like organisms in human patients (Fagundes-Neto et al., 1995), rabbits (Takeuchi et al., 1978, Peeters et al., 1984a), pigs (Helie et al., 1991), dogs (Wada et al., 1996a) and cotton-top tamarins (Mansfield et al., 2001b). The numbers of such bacteria appear to be small relative to the surface population (Takeuchi et al., 1978, Peeters et al., 1984a, Helie et al., 1991).

For example, a REPEC O103 strain formed AE lesions on a rabbit cell line but not on HeLa cells (Nougayrede et al., 1999); moreover, the proportion of bovine LEE-positive VT-positive E. coli strains that produced AE lesions on a bovine cell line was higher than that producing such lesions on the human HEp-2 cell line (Wieler et al., 1998). Genetic modification of an AE organism leading to the expression of a non-intimate adhesin appropriate to the host cell type may considerably enhance the organism's AE capability on the homologous cell line (Deng et al., 2003).",

For routine detection of AE lesions in vitro, the associated characteristic cytoskeletal reorganization has proved to be a useful target for fluorescence microscopy. Knutton et al. (1989) used the specific affinity of the fungal toxin phalloidin for the F-actin formed beneath the attached bacteria to develop the fluorescence actin staining (FAS) test. In this test, phalloidin labelled with a fluorescent dye is used; \u201cco-localization\u201d of adherent bacteria and bright fluorescence by phase-contrast and epifluorescent microscopy is a sensitive, specific and technically straightforward indicator of AE lesions on cultured cell monolayers (Donnenberg and Nataro, 1995). Use of a fluorescence-labelled \u03b1-actinin antibody has also proved successful in the specific detection of AE lesions in vitro (Ismaili et al., 1995b). FAS has also been performed with apparent success on frozen histopathological sections viewed by epifluorescent microscopy (Vallance et al., 2002) or confocal laser scanning microscopy (Abe et al., 1998).",

In general, bacteria adhere to enterocytes in an extensive or multifocal pattern and typically have a distinct, coccoid appearance (Janke et al., 1989). Colonized cells appear degenerate and many are hyperchromatic, rounded-up or pyknotic. Mucosal erosions and detachment of enterocytes are commonly seen. At low magnification this gives a ragged, irregular, \u201cscalloped\u201d or \u201ccobblestone\u201d appearance to the mucosal surface (Moon et al., 1983, Hall et al., 1985, Janke et al., 1989, Pearson et al., 1989, Higgins et al., 1997, Mansfield et al., 2001b). Bacteria may be seen inside enterocytes, which are heavily colonized on their apical surface (Helie et al., 1991). An inflammatory infiltrate of variable intensity, typically neutrophilic but sometimes mixed, is often seen in the lamina propria.",

In mice, hyperplasia of the colonic crypts is a prominent feature of infection with C. rodentium (Luperchio and Schauer, 2001), and a similar but less marked change is reported in other species, for example tamarin monkeys (Mansfield et al., 2001b).",

However, the fine detail of an attachment suspected to be AE in nature cannot be discerned fully by light microscopy. Some reports assert that a diagnosis of AE lesions can often be made on the basis of conventional histopathology alone (Janke et al., 1989, Janke et al., 1990). However, enteric disease is often associated with more than one enteropathogen (Moxley and Francis, 1986, Hall et al., 1988b, Janke et al., 1989, Janke et al., 1990, Zhu et al., 1994, Holland et al., 1999b), and this may complicate the histopathological appearance of tissues. Hall et al. (1988b) found that light microscopy was unreliable for distinguishing between AE and non-intimate bacterial attachment in the large intestines of diarrhoeic calves. TEM remains the definitive diagnostic technique for AE lesions in vivo. If an antiserum specific for the suspected AE pathogen is available, immunohistochemical techniques may be used to identify the lesional organisms (Moxley and Francis, 1986, Wales et al., 2001b).",

However, studies seeking putative AE pathogens by screening faeces for LEE-associated genes have found such genes to be commonly present in the flora of both healthy and diseased animals (Holland et al., 1996, Holland et al., 1999b, Orden et al., 2000, De la Fuente et al., 2002, Penteado et al., 2002). Furthermore, isolates encoding intimin frequently lack a demonstrable AE phenotype in vitro (Sandhu et al., 1999, La Ragione et al., 2002) or in vivo (la Ragione et al., 2002). Therefore, the presence of genetic markers of AE bacteria should be interpreted with caution in the diagnosis of possible AE-associated disease when histopathological examination of tissues is not undertaken. There is an association between disease and the subtype of intimin present in faecal isolates of putative AEEC from cattle (see below). This suggests that, for some host species, the typing of LEE elements from clinical isolates may help to determine their pathogenicity.",

The report of the former case describes the detection of VT and other EHEC genes in an O26:H11 strain isolated from an in-contact animal with similar clinical signs. In cases of AEEC-associated diarrhoea there is commonly concurrent infection with one or more of the following: coronavirus, bovine viral diarrhoea virus, rotavirus, Cryptosporidium, Salmonella and ETEC (Hall et al., 1985, Hall et al., 1988b, Moxley and Francis, 1986, Pospischil et al., 1987, Janke et al., 1989, Janke et al., 1990, Vorster et al., 1994, Holland et al., 1999b, Gunning et al., 2001).",

Cases in which AE lesions are confined to the small intestine are less common (Janke et al., 1989, Janke et al., 1990). Serotype does not appear to be closely associated with the distribution of lesions; thus, AE lesions associated with E. coli O26:H11 were found by Mainil et al., 1987, Pearson et al., 1999 to occur only in the large intestine, but by Gunning et al. (2001) to occur in both the large and small intestines. The relative contribution of host and strain to the observed distribution of lesions is uncertain, and in some cases the sensitivity of detection may have been a significant factor.",

            "text": "Putative AEEC are isolated frequently from cattle. Orden et al. (2002) reported a prevalence of EPEC-like AEEC of 8.2% amongst cattle of all ages, and Aktan et al. (2004) found eae-positive E. coli in 3% of animals entering abattoirs in the UK. In other studies eae-positive E. coli were isolated from 5 to 20% of diarrhoeic calves and 21 to 40% of healthy calves (China et al., 1998, Orden et al., 1998, Holland et al., 1999b). Whilst these calf studies showed an apparent lack of any relationship between the prevalence of putative AEEC and the presence of diarrhoea, a longitudinal study of calves between one and 12 weeks of age showed a positive relationship (China et al., 1998). There is evidence of a particular association between calf diarrhoea and the presence of the \u03b2 subtype of intimin (China et al., 1998, China et al., 1999, Orden et al., 2003). The reported proportions of bovine putative AEEC isolates that produce VT vary between 20 and 50% (Orden et al., 1998, Orden et al., 2002, Holland et al., 1999b). Serogroups particularly associated with bovine eae-positive E. coli are O4, O5, O14, O26, O111, O118 and O123, with O26 having been reported most consistently (Mainil et al., 1993, Orden et al., 1998, Orden et al., 2003, Holland et al., 1999b). Strains of E. coli O26:H11 and O26 possessing EPEC-like features, i.e., hybridizing with eae probes but lacking VT, have been isolated from diarrhoeic calves (Fischer et al., 1994, Saridakis et al., 1997, Orden et al., 2003). It appears, therefore, that bovine pathogenic O26 AEEC strains include not only those that produce VT (described above in association with AE lesions in calves) but also EPEC-like strains that do not. There is some evidence of geographical variation in putative bovine pathogenic AEEC. In particular, the predominant eae-positive, VT-producing isolates reported from diarrhoeic calves in Germany and Belgium are of serotype O118:H16 (Wieler et al., 1998). Furthermore, analysis of E. coli O118:H16 and O118:H- strains has shown an association between bovine-derived AEEC and human-pathogenic EHEC isolates (Wieler et al., 2000).",

Calves are affected predominantly, but older animals, including adults, may also show AE enteritis. Putative AEEC strains are common in healthy and diarrhoeic animals. Certain serogroups (O5, O26 and O111) are prominent amongst both proven and putative bovine-pathogenic AEEC strains. Certain bovine VT-producing AEEC strains (for example O26:H11 and O118:H16) share serotypes with human EHEC; cross-species pathogenicity, however, remains largely a matter of speculation.",

Consequently, it was not clear whether these AE bacteria were of bovine or ovine origin. Two cases of natural infection by AE pathogens were reported in diseased neonatal lambs (Janke et al., 1989). The colon was affected in both lambs and the ileum in one. E. coli isolates from the lambs were not typed. AE lesions produced by untyped bacteria were also observed on the ileal and large intestinal mucosa of symptomless neonatal lambs (Wales et al., 2005a). In addition, multifocal colonization of the large intestinal mucosa of older, weaned sheep by bacteria forming AE lesions was reported by Cookson et al., 2002a, Woodward et al., 2003. Animals in these last two reports had been inoculated with the human pathogen EHEC O157:H7, but the AE lesions were shown to be formed by E. coli O115:H- in the first case, and by E. coli O26 together with other AE organisms in the second; the animals remained clinically normal.",

These were attributed to a VT-producing E. coli O103:H2 recovered from the large intestine. Coccidia were also seen in the intestinal tissues. An outbreak of fatal, acute diarrhoea associated with AEEC in one-week-old kids was reported by Drolet et al. (1994b). Investigation of an individual case revealed focally extensive AE lesions in the large intestine and an untypable eae-positive E. coli was recovered from the intestines. Recently, Barlow et al. (2005), found AE lesions caused by E. coli O145 in the ileum and colon of a 2-year-old goat with mild diarrhoea and severe dehydration, from a herd experiencing several cases of anorexia, weakness and death in milking females. In addition, Wales et al. (2005b) reported AE lesions caused by one or more unidentified organisms in the large intestine of clinically normal neonatal kids that had been inoculated with E. coli O157:H7. Experimentally, colostrum-deprived kid goats inoculated with a putative calf VT-producing AEEC developed colonic AE lesions (Tominaga et al., 1989).",

However, in one study of 1013 animals (de la Fuente et al., 2002), E. coli O26 accounted for nearly 43% of eae-positive isolates from diarrhoeic lambs but only 2.5% from healthy lambs. This suggests that, whilst LEE genes are widespread, only certain LEE-positive strains, some of which may have characteristic serotypes, have the pathogenic phenotype in any particular host species. The serovars of eae-positive E. coli isolated from sheep are diverse and dissimilar to those from goats (Cid et al., 2001, De la Fuente et al., 2002, Aktan et al., 2004).",

Diarrhoea may be haemorrhagic (Janke et al., 1989), but gross findings typically are unremarkable (Janke et al., 1989, Higgins et al., 1997) and isolates rarely produce VT (Janke et al., 1989, Zhu et al., 1994, Higgins et al., 1997). AE lesions may be present in the small or large intestines, or in both (Janke et al., 1989, Higgins et al., 1997, Holland et al., 2000). In the field, dual infection of the small and large intestines of weaned pigs with ETEC O149 and AEEC O45 has been reported (Wada et al., 1996b). Serogroup O45 is implicated commonly in AEEC postweaning diarrhoea (Helie et al., 1991, Zhu et al., 1994), but within this serogroup strains that lack eae and possess attributes of ETEC (K88 adhesin, enterotoxin) may also be found (Zhu et al., 1994). Several other serogroups, including O26, O75, O116 and O\u2212, have been reported in association with AEEC in pigs (Neef et al., 1994, Higgins et al., 1997, Holland et al., 2000). Porcine diarrhoea-associated E. coli strains of various serogroups that produce the FAS reaction and AE lesions in vitro, but which are negative in conventional tests for eae and intimin, have been reported (Penteado et al., 2001). It is possible that these possess a hitherto unknown variant of intimin. Pathogenic E. coli strains producing a variant of VT also colonize the pig intestine and cause oedema disease, but attachment of these strains to the mucosa occurs via F18 fimbriae, not AE mechanisms (Gyles, 1998).",

Rabbit AEEC strains rarely produce enterotoxins or VT (Pohl et al., 1993, Blanco et al., 1996), and accordingly are classified as rabbit EPEC (REPEC). In contrast to other host species, the presence of the eae gene in rabbit intestinal E. coli is closely associated with diarrhoeal disease (Blanco et al., 1996). REPEC strains have been widely studied in view of their commercial importance, their similarity in many respects to human EPEC, and the suitability of the rabbit for experimental studies.",

Experimentally, strains produced diarrhoea of variable consistency in a proportion of inoculated rabbits (Peeters et al., 1984d, Heczko et al., 2000); they differed in virulence (Peeters et al., 1988) and appeared to be avirulent in suckling rabbits, despite forming AE lesions in vivo (Peeters et al., 1984a). Diarrhoea started typically at approximately 6 days post-inoculation (Cantey and Blake, 1977, Peeters et al., 1984d) and the gross findings included liquid intestinal contents, thickening or oedema of the intestinal wall, and swollen mesenteric lymph nodes (Cantey and Blake, 1977, Peeters et al., 1984d). Initial attachment of the bacteria, within 24 h of inoculation, was non-intimate and was restricted to the follicle-associated epithelium of Peyer's patches in the ileum (Cantey and Inman, 1981, Peeters et al., 1984b, von Moll and Cantey, 1997, Heczko et al., 2000). For one strain (RDEC-1), non-intimate attachment was further shown to be restricted to the microfold (M) epithelial cells covering the specialized dome villi over the ileal Peyer's patches (Inman and Cantey, 1983). Subsequent intimate (AE) attachment, which was observed from 3 days after inoculation, occurred in the ileum and large intestine (Cantey and Inman, 1981, Heczko et al., 2000), and was accompanied by inflammation and ulceration (Peeters et al., 1984d, Heczko et al., 2000). This progressive sequence of attachment may explain the differences between suckling and weanling strains in terms of the speed of onset of diarrhoea. Furthermore, the resistance of suckling rabbits to weanling-associated strains may be due to the fact that Peyer's patches do not develop before 2 weeks of age (Heczko et al., 2000). In addition, weanling rabbit-associated strains do not adhere to neonatal rabbit intestinal villi in vitro (Peeters et al., 1984d).",

REPEC O15:H- includes the prototypical strain RDEC-1 (Cantey and Blake, 1977, Cantey et al., 1981) that encodes a plasmid-borne rabbit-specific fimbrial adhesin, termed AF/R1, which mediates non-intimate adhesion to ileal M cells and is an established virulence factor (Berendson et al., 1983, Wolf et al., 1988). RDEC-1 also elaborates a soluble factor which affects the electrical properties of rabbit ileal mucosa in vivo and may therefore have diarrhoeagenic properties (Raimondi et al., 2001). Another REPEC O15:H- strain (U83/39) resembled RDEC-1 in respect of the disease produced and the lesion distribution (Peeters et al., 1984b, Peeters et al., 1985), but it encoded a different plasmid-borne adhesin on the ral operon; this adhesin, which is also a virulence factor, is homologous with the K88 (F4) fimbria of bovine and porcine ETEC (Adams et al., 1997).",

Use of the ligated intestinal loop and oral inoculation techniques in rabbits has proved valuable in studies of AEEC affecting other host species, particularly man (Moon et al., 1983, Fagundes-Neto et al., 1995). Oral inoculation of infant rabbits with EHEC O157:H7 produced colonization of the small and large intestines, AE lesions and non-haemorrhagic diarrhoea (Potter et al., 1985, Pai et al., 1986, Sherman et al., 1988).",

The lesion cannot be induced with bacterial culture supernates or cell lysates, i.e., it is associated with intact bacterial cells. It is characterized by the rearrangement of the host actin cytoskeleton into stress fibres, accompanied by vinculin rod formation in the cytoplasm. With REPEC O103, the CPE is dependent on the presence of EspA, EspB and EspD but independent of the presence of intimin or Tir (Nougayrede et al., 1999, Marches et al., 2000); it is also associated with arrest of the HeLa cell cycle (Nougayrede et al., 2001).",

Comparison of isolates then led to their further redesignation as C. rodentium, a new species which, uniquely amongst the Citrobacter isolates examined, possessed LEE genes (Schauer et al., 1995). A murine pathogen in Japan, which caused a disease (\u201cinfectious megaentron\u201d) similar to TMCH, was classified as an atypical E. coli and termed mouse-pathogenic E. coli (MPEC). However, MPEC was subsequently shown by comparative biochemistry and genetics to be indistinguishable from C. rodentium (Luperchio et al., 2000, Luperchio and Schauer, 2001).",

The factors underlying the susceptibility of mouse strains to overt disease are unclear (Vallance et al., 2003). Clinically affected animals have soft faeces and mortality in suckling mice is high (Barthold et al., 1978). The main gross lesion is a thickening of the intestine commencing with the distal colon and extending in some cases to affect the rest of the colon and sometimes the caecum and ileum (Luperchio and Schauer, 2001). On histopathological examination of experimentally infected mice, heavy colonization of the luminal colonic mucosa and superficial portions of crypts by C. rodentium is seen from 4 days post-inoculation. There is accompanying marked hyperplasia of crypts, peaking 2\u20133 weeks after inoculation (Barthold et al., 1978, Johnson and Barthold, 1979, Luperchio and Schauer, 2001). Bacterial attachment is AE in nature (Johnson and Barthold, 1979, Luperchio and Schauer, 2001). Multifocal mucosal erosions, ulceration and suppurative inflammation, progressing to mononuclear cell infiltration in survivors, may accompany the hyperplastic changes (Barthold et al., 1978, Luperchio and Schauer, 2001), but the variation in inflammatory responses is poorly understood. In animals that recover, the intestinal lesion regresses completely by 7 weeks post-inoculation in adults but more slowly in young mice (Barthold et al., 1978, Johnson and Barthold, 1979). Acquired immunity, mediated via CD4+ T lymphocytes and possibly B lymphocytes, limited the pathological changes and mortality associated with infection by C. rodentium (Simmons et al., 2003). However, in a highly susceptible strain of mice, the presence of T and B lymphocytes was associated with more severe intestinal changes (Vallance et al., 2003).",

It therefore appears to have been acquired independently of E. coli LEEs and may have been plasmid-borne. LEE genes of C. rodentium, including eae, tir, espB and espD, are colonization factors in mice (Schauer and Falkow, 1993, Newman et al., 1999, Deng et al., 2003, Mundy et al., 2003); eae and tir are also virulence factors for murine infection (Deng et al., 2003). Outside of the LEE, disruption of a C. rodentium gene cluster which is homologous to EPEC bfp attenuates mouse colonization profoundly, indicating that pilus-mediated non-intimate adhesion may be a significant mechanism for TMCH in vivo (Mundy et al., 2003). This indicates that similar non-intimate adhesins may be used by large intestinal (C. rodentium) as well as small intestinal (EPEC) AE pathogens.",

The literature contains reports of 15 cases of canine enteritis associated with AEEC and verified by histopathology and electron microscopy (Broes et al., 1988, Drolet et al., 1994a, Wada et al., 1996a, Holland et al., 2000). The 15 animals were young, usually less than 3 months of age and none exceeding 5 months. Diarrhoea, which was invariably present, was often chronic (Broes et al., 1988, Wada et al., 1996a, Holland et al., 2000) and non-haemorrhagic (Drolet et al., 1994a). Typically the dogs were seriously ill and concurrently infected with one or more other agents (distemper virus, parvovirus, coccidia, Giardia and Cryptosporidium). There were often associated additional losses of puppies which were not subjected to pathological examination. Gross findings, apart from soft or watery intestinal contents that were sometimes blood-tinged, were unremarkable or not described. AE lesions were reported in the small intestine of all cases, and in the large intestine of seven of the nine cases in which it was examined. In one unusual case, lesions were described in the small and large intestines and the gastric pylorus (Wada et al., 1996a), in association with evidence of enteric distemper virus. Various serovars of eae-positive E. coli, including O49:H10 (Broes et al., 1988, Drolet et al., 1994a), O118:H- (Wada et al., 1996a), O45, O119 and O115 (Drolet et al., 1994a), as well as O- and untypable strains, were isolated from the cases. In some instances, E. coli O49 (Broes et al., 1988) and O118 (Wada et al., 1996a) were demonstrated in lesions by immunolabelling. Most isolates were examined for enterotoxin and VT, with negative results. Six of eight isolates examined for a BFP sequence by gene probe were positive (Drolet et al., 1994a).",

In the same study a similar association between VTEC and diarrhoea was found. In cases of acute diarrhoea positive for potential enteric pathogens, putative AEEC was the only such agent detected in 20 of 23 cases. In cases of chronic diarrhoea, other infectious and non-infectious factors were frequently present in addition to putative AEEC. Many serogroups and untypable strains were isolated. In an experimental study (Hart et al., 1990), AE lesions were readily induced in vitro on canine jejunal and ileal organ cultures inoculated with a human disease-derived EPEC O111:H-. When putative canine strains of EPEC (Drolet et al., 1994a) were examined in vitro, it was found that all of nine eae-positive isolates adhered to piglet ileum and produced AE lesions, but only one adhered and formed FAS-positive lesions on HEp-2 cells (Beaudry et al., 1996). Putative AEEC isolated from dogs and cats encompassed a range of serogroups (Holland et al., 1999a). Such eae-positive isolates also frequently encoded the BFP structural gene (bfpA), had a variety of chromosomal insertion sites for the LEE, and produced AE lesions in ligated ileal loops of rabbits (Goffaux et al., 2000). A novel combination of virulence factors (eae plus the ETEC heat-stable enterotoxin) was detected in E. coli isolates from four of 52 dogs (Holland et al., 1999a).",

In a follow-up study of the tamarin colony there was a significant association between faecal isolates encoding eae and colitis (as demonstrated by biopsy). The precise role of AEEC in the colitis that is commonly seen in captive cotton-top tamarins remains unclear, as additional factors (diet, environment, and possibly other pathogens) also appear to play a role (Mansfield et al., 2001b).",

            "text": "Microbiological surveys demonstrated substantial variation between different avian species in the nature of intestinal putative AEEC. Approximately 10% of healthy pigeons carried E. coli encoding Stx2f, a specific subtype of VT (Dell'Omo et al., 1998, Schmidt et al., 2000, Morabito et al., 2001); almost all strains also carried the eae gene (Dell'Omo et al., 1998, Morabito et al., 2001). The \u03b2 subtype of intimin and the O45 serogroup appeared to be particularly common amongst VT-producing eae-positive E. coli from pigeons (Morabito et al., 2001, Kobayashi et al., 2002). As pigeon surveys have concentrated upon characterizing VT-positive isolates, the prevalence of eae-positive E. coli not encoding VT is, however, uncertain. By contrast, 15% of healthy broiler chickens carried eae-positive E. coli encoding \u03b2-intimin but not VT, and 40% of healthy gulls carried eae-positive, VT-negative E. coli encoding non-\u03b2-intimin (Kobayashi et al., 2002). Schremmer et al. (1999) reported that psittacine birds yielded eae-positive E. coli, predominantly from diarrhoeic cases (six of seven isolates); three of the isolates were of serotype O110:H6, and all carried BFP genes, unlike pigeon, broiler and gull isolates (Kobayashi et al., 2002). Thus, the information available, albeit incomplete, suggests that AEEC strains from different avian host species often differ in respect of serovar, intimin subtype, the presence and subtype of VT, and the presence of other virulence factors such as BFP. It is not known whether carriage of these bacterial strains is related to enteric disease in the various host species. In one study, young pigeons that carried VT-producing organisms were significantly lighter in weight than those that did not (Pohl et al., 1994, Morabito et al., 2001). This, together with evidence of AEEC strains in dead finches (Pennycott et al., 1998) and diarrhoeic Psittaciformes (Schremmer et al., 1999), suggests that AEEC may have clinical effects in birds.",

The presence of eae, typically in conjunction with approximately 40 other LEE genes, in a substantial proportion of diverse E. coli strains from healthy animals is described above for various host species. Only some of these putative AEEC strains are demonstrably pathogenic, suggesting that the maintenance of the LEE in the wider E. coli population confers a survival advantage. One AEEC strain, the human pathogen EHEC O157:H7, is normally non-pathogenic but persists in a proportion of cattle and sheep (Cray and Moon, 1995, Kudva et al., 1995, Cornick et al., 2000, Wray et al., 2000, Conedera et al., 2001, Cookson et al., 2002a), pigs (Booher et al., 2002) and possibly other non-human species. The LEE-mediated capacity of E coli O157:H7 to adhere to epithelial cells may play a role in its persistence in animals (Gyles, 1998). In fact, isogenic eae mutants are less persistent than wild-type E. coli O157:H7 in cattle and sheep (Cornick et al., 2002, Woodward et al., 2003).",

In addition to the capacity for intimate adhesion to the intestinal mucosa, AE pathogens may possess a variety of other virulence factors, including VT and non-intimate adhesins. The AE capacity appears to have been acquired independently by many AE strains, via insertion of the LEE pathogenicity island at different locations in the bacterial chromosome. AE lesions are typically associated with diarrhoea and may be seen in the small or large intestine (or both), or even in the stomach. The large intestine is usually affected, but colonization of the small intestine is more variable. Haemorrhagic diarrhoea does not appear to be closely associated with VT-producing AEEC. Factors that may affect the presence or severity of AE lesions include: age, concurrent infection with other enteropathogens, and diet. AEEC strains are sometimes regarded as minor pathogens in species such as cattle, but the ubiquity of E. coli in intestinal samples may mask potentially significant AE pathogens unless routine screening for relevant virulence markers (e.g., eae and certain serogroups) is undertaken. The relationship between veterinary and human pathogenic AEEC strains that share a serotype, for example O26:H11, remains uncertain. The possible role of the LEE as an intestinal colonization factor is under scrutiny in the light of the carriage by animals of proven and putative human AE pathogens.",
