To date, 127 doctors have died as documented byItalian Higher Institute of Health. Our Italian experience, as described by Nacoti et al,2 suggests that hospitals become a major source of COVID-19 carriers as they are populated by infected patients who transmit the virus to uninfected patients and health care workers when medication, mechanical ventilators, and personal protective equipment are not available. Asymptomatic or presymptomatic health care workers also become vectors.",

On March 31, a patient with COVID-19 and intestinal ischemia presented to the San Salvatore Academy Hospital, L\u2019Aquila, Italy. After surgery, he was transferred to the COVID Intensive Care Unit located in a pavilion outside the hospital. The problem arose from the lack of a portable ventilator. During the transfer, we provided manual ventilation using the DAR reservoir bag (Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN). We added a high-efficiency particulate air filter but felt it was more effective to place the filter on the expiratory exit of the DAR reservoir bag and not between the latter and the endotracheal tube as was described by Liew et al.3 We used a filter called \u201cDAR Adult Electrostatic Filter\u201d that provided antibacterial and antiviral filtering \u226599,999%.4 In this way, we were able to position a surgical mask on the filter, which deterred a possible spread of droplets and was psychologically more comfortable to the health care worker by minimizing his contact with the flow of air leaving the reservoir bag (Figure). We feel that the presence of the surgical mask over the filter provides extra safety. Clearly, there is a need for scientific data on the reduction of aerosolization during the transport of manual ventilating patient brought about by our craft device; our perception, however, is encouraged by literature data showing that any kind device, even homemade ones, would be better than no protection in reducing aerosol exposure.5",
