The combined use of NPA PCR tests and traditional serology likely had contributed to a greater prevalence of AP infections in our study. M. pneumoniae and C. pneumoniae infections were diagnosed exclusively by NPA PCR tests, but not serology. Meanwhile, Chlamydophila and C. burnetii can be detected only by serology. All the patients with AP infection survived, whereas only one of them had received antibiotic covering APs. Another study also showed that AP infection resulted in a lower 30-day mortality than other pathogens, although the difference was not statistically significant (2.2% vs 6.0%, P = .09).7 It is hypothesized that APs cause pneumonia of milder severity, and its clinical course is usually self-limiting without antibiotic therapy, even in older people of lower immunity.

However, previous studies showed that L. pneumophila was a rare (<5%) pathogen in NHAP.8, 9, 13, 14 Our study has confirmed the rarity of Legionella infection in NHAP, based on the result of urinary antigen tests that were performed in nearly 90% of the study patients.

Our study suggested that those nursing home residents with pneumonia who had no pathogens identified did not have purulent sputum and chest crepitations on examination. Some of these cases could be caused by aspiration pneumonitis. Because it is difficult to clinically distinguish between aspiration pneumonitis and aspiration pneumonia, especially on initial assessment,16 it is advisable to adopt a \u201cde-escalation\u201d approach and refrain from prescribing prolonged empirical antibiotics in patients with bulbar dysfunction and aspiration pneumonitis. This would help to reduce antibiotic resistance and the cost of unnecessary antibiotics.",

Second, the incidence of atypical infections may vary in time and place. Our experience may not be applicable in other settings. Legionnaires\u2019 disease may be endemic in some facilities where the water supply is colonized. Chlamydophila infection may cause local outbreaks. Third, we did not examine the relationship between patients\u2019 swallowing ability and aspiration pneumonitis. Fourth, the definition of aspiration pneumonitis was arbitrary in this study. Our patients without pathogens identified did not necessarily meet the classical definition of aspiration pneumonitis, that is, sudden onset of choking after vomiting.2, 16 Fifth, although NPA and blood serology were collected from the majority of patients, only 57% and 38% of the patients could cough up sputum suitable for routine culture and mycobacterial culture, respectively.",
