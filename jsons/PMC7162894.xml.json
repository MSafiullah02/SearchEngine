This fact drives a strong demand for high production efficiency in aquaculture industry in order to cover the feeding needs of the world\u2019s growing population, in the middle of an increasing environmental crisis1,2. As a result, the aquaculture industry has continuously increased profits in a high rate. However, outbreaks of diseases caused by infectious agents are significantly restricting intensified aquaculture. According to literature3, 22.6% of all disease outbreaks are caused by viruses. Among these, viral nervous necrosis (VNN), also named vacuolating encephalopathy and retinopathy or encephalomyelitis, is a devastating disease, which induces cell necrosis accompanied by vacuolation in fish retina and brain. Its clinical symptoms include changes in skin color with abnormal swimming, low feed ingestion and altered buoyancy in affected fish. The disease is caused by nervous necrosis virus (NNV) or nodavirus, affecting more than 30 different fish species, worldwide. VNN causes high mortalities (80\u2013100% in several species e.g. European sea bass), emerging as a major problem especially in the Mediterranean area, since it cannot be prevented by vaccination or effective treatment4\u20136.",

All these demands limit their wide use for routine testing, especially in poor-equipped laboratories, as well as their accessibility and usability in field diagnosis.

Large sized particles develop steric hindrance in a high degree, affecting interactions of the target with a labelled antibody, which could impede the fluidity in the strip. On the other hand, small nanoparticles, are not optimal for visual signals formation35. To determine the size where the signal would be optimal, commercially available nanoparticles were studied. Gold nanoparticles stabilized either in citrate (40 nm) or in PBS buffer (5, 10, 20, 30, 60 nm) were conjugated with the polyclonal anti-nodavirus antibody. Formation and intensity of TZ and CZ on the LFB was assessed for evaluation of the particles optimum size for the nodavirus LFB. Figure 2b proves that all PBS stabilized particles were successfully conjugated with antibodies while no conjugation occurred on the citrate 40 nm nanoparticles. Therefore, Au NPs stabilized with PBS buffer facilitates proteins (antibodies) conjugation while the citrate buffer is more efficient on conjugation of SH-tailed oligonucleotides8. Use of 5 and 60 nm NPs resulted in faint control zones. The 10 and 20 nm formulations formed strong control zones but the test zones were faint possibly due to difficulty in interaction with the larger nodavirus particle. The optimum signal was achieved with 30 nm Au NPs, a size which is similar to the virus size. That size seems to be optimum for conjugation with different antibodies for different analytes intended for use on LFBs, e.g. anti-E.coli monoclonal antibody35 or anti-biotin antibody26, indicating that nanoparticles in the range of 30\u201340 nm are better for antibody conjugation than smaller or bigger particles.",

Ideally, the developing solution facilitates the nanoparticles and sample mixture movement along the biosensor with flow rates that allows test completion in short time providing, in parallel, sufficient time for virion interaction with the modified NPs. Moreover, the developing solution should also prevent the non-specific nanoparticles absorption by the LFB membrane36. Glycerol increases the mixture viscosity causing a slower flow rate. Addition of several surfactants (SDS, Tween-20, SDS, etc) or proteins (e.g. BSA) enables the particles movement from the conjugate pad. Eleven different formulations were studied and their detailed composition is described in Table 1, while the respective results are presented in Fig. S2. The use of high pH buffer or BSA did not result in any specific signal formation (Fig. S2a). Two formulations were optimal for non-specific signal elimination: i) 8G/1S/P, and ii) 6G/1S/0.1T/P. The formulation that contained 80% glycerol resulted in prolonged running times (\u223c60 min); therefore it was excluded from further studies. It was observed that Tween-20 concentration seemed decisive for the biosensor specificity. For that reason, increasing Tween-20 concentrations were tested in the range of 0.1\u20131% and the optimum results were obtained with 0.2% Tween-20 in developing solution (Fig. S2b). Concluding, the optimum developing solution for background elimination, rapid assay times, and specific bands was obtained using 6% glycerol, 0.2% Tween-20 and 1% SDS in 1\u00d7PBS, pH 7.4.",

The antibody dispensing velocity is an essential parameter for production of a uniform immobilized test zone. In general, high volatile solutions (e.g. acetone) are dispensed with high velocity (>200nL/s) whereas low volatile solutions (water, ethanol) are sprayed with low velocity (<120nL/s). Based on previous studies for antibody immobilization on nitrocellulose membranes37, a methanol containing solution (50 mL/L) was used. Methanol results in medium volatile solutions and the use of 250nL/s dispensing velocity was optimum for the uniform formation of the anti-rabbit IgG control zone. However, the same dispensing velocity resulted in the formation of two \u2018pseudozones\u2019 when the anti-nodavirus antibody solution was sprayed on the membrane. It seems that high dispensing velocity creates a gap in the middle of the spraying zone, which doesn\u2019t allow proper absorption of the antibody solution from the membrane, perhaps due to non-uniform evaporation. The use of lower dispensing velocity resulted in a single uniform test zone and the velocity of 60nL/s was chosen since it resulted in the optimum signal.",

            "text": "The proposed LFB enabled nodavirus detection in D. Labrax samples with minimum pre-processing (i.e. manual brain homogenization and separation of the insoluble fraction by centrifugation or SSN-1 cell culture supernatant). The samples supernatants were applied directly to the nodavirus biosensors, which were run and scanned. Eleven infected (positive; n = 4) and non-infected (negative; n = 7) D. labrax samples were applied on the LFB (Fig. 5). All results were visualized within 30 minutes. All tested samples were verified with SSN-1 cell culturing. Five samples were originated from Saronikos Gulf area (S1, 2, 6, 8, 9), 2 samples were from Korinthian Gulf region (S3\u20134), 1 sample was collected from Amvrakikos Gulf (S7) and 3 samples were originated from aquacultures in Cyprus (S5, 10, 11). A negative control, containing only developing solution, and a positive control, containing 0.5 \u00b5L of nodavirus containing cell culture supernatant (corresponding to the limit of detection), were included in each run. The use of the cell culture supernatant in an amount corresponding to the assays detection limit was intended to be used as a visual \u201cyardstick\u201d, a comparison measure to indicate which signal could be positive. If the positive control was intended to be used just to confirm the LFBs\u2019 proper operation more supernatant could be applied to provide more intense signal. We observe that in the LFBs with positive signal the gold nanoparticle conjugates appear to bind non-specifically between the test and the control zones. In any case that non-specific binding is not crucial for the nodavirus presence assessment, since the test zone is clearly positive or negative. Most of the non-infected samples (S5\u201310) did not show any signal in the TZ. The infected samples resulted in positive signals with varying intensities above the positive control signal, which correlates with different amounts of nodavirus in the sample. One negative and one positive sample (S1 and S11, as characterized by SSN-1 cell culturing) resulted in similar faint zones. In order to decide the disease state of each sample, the test zones were quantified with the publicly available, easy to use ImageJ software, based on scanned LFB images. Quantification confirmed that S1 was negative and S11 positive with very low virus load (Fig. 5b). In the case of such ambiguous results on the field, the LFBs images could be photographed and quantified with ImageJ with a smartphone. The scanned images of the LFBs were independently evaluated by a second person, and were compared to LFB images with known outcomes (positive and negative).",

            "text": "Cost-effective and labor-saving methods for fish infectious diseases identification have attracted an increasing interest to aquaculture industry in recent years, due to their high economic impact. The development of a highly promised robust and rapid lateral flow biosensor has been reported in the present study. The proposed LFB can be used for simple and accurate screening of nodavirus detection in various fish species. To enable on site analysis of nodavirus, we developed and optimized a paper LFB based on gold nanoparticles for easy, specific and sensitive visual detection of nodavirus viral particles (virions) in biological samples. The target virions can be simply detected by the red colored signal formation in the LFBs test zone. The LFB permits the visual detection of nodavirus particles within 30 minutes without using any instrumentation. The total assay starting including tissue homogenization, centrifugation and virion detection with the biosensor was accomplished in less than 60 min. The total cost of the assay is less than 3 \u20ac. Undergoing studies by our research group include complete validation of the nodavirus biosensor on fish culture facilities, and efforts to improve the biosensors\u2019 sensitivity of the LFB utilizing dual nanoparticles labels26,41 and signal enhancement systems in general. Moreover, the elimination of centrifugation from the sample preparation step is among our future goals to further simplify nodavirus detection on-site. Concluding, the proposed biosensor could become a reliable tool for the rapid screening of questionable samples in aquaculture facilities. As a screening tool it can be used to decide whether a sample is positive or negative, and indicate which samples have ambiguous state of the disease and need further analysis by other methodologies in a laboratory setup. Such a procedure could lower the cost and the analysis time to maintain healthy fishes in aquaculture facilities.",
