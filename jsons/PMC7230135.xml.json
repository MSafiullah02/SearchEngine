Pangolins, or scaly anteaters, have recently been flagshiped as one of the most illegally traded mammals, being literally eaten to extinction [2]. Based on reports from the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES), a minimum number of c. 895,000 African and Asian pangolins were trafficked during the last decade (2010\u20132019). They were mainly destined to Asian markets including China and Vietnam [3], where they feed the growing demand from the Traditional Chinese Medicine market [4]. As a corollary, the pangolin trade has very recently been pinpointed as posing a serious threat to human health, pangolins being potentially involved in the COVID-19 pandemic [5, 6]. Pangolins are also part of the traditional wild meat intake and pharmacopeia in most of their range countries [7, 8], and as such suffer from the \u2018bushmeat crisis\u2019 that threaten the survival of many vertebrates in the tropics [9].",

To date, a certain number of mitochondrial, nuclear and Y-borne genes have been sequenced in pangolins [14\u201317], providing useful resources for the accurate \u2018tagging\u2019 of the species involved in the trade [18]. On the other hand, our ability to trace the geographic origins of seized pangolins has remained limited because of a lack of exhaustive DNA registers and the reduced geographic resolution of traditional gene sequencing [19\u201323]. Although microsatellite loci were developed in an Asian (Manis javanica) and an African species (Smutsia temminckii) [24, 25], their application to the issue of the traceability of the trade remains limited or pending [26, 27]. Recently, single nucleotide polymorphic markers (SNPs) have successfully been used to assign seizures of M. javanica to potential geographic sources in South-East Asia [28]. So far, no genotyping approach has been applied to assess the number of individuals involved in large (scale) seizures, despite the potential advantage this would have for seizure processing [29].",

A first sample set included 24 samples from the Ebo forest (population \u2018Ebo\u2019), c. 75 km north-east of Douala, as ascertained by circumscribing the supply area that receives bushmeat from Ebo together with interviews with bushmeat sellers (data not shown). A second sample set included 13 samples likely originating from diverse geographic sources, possibly including Ebo (\u2018altEbo\u2019), according to the same interviews. Samples consisted of fresh and smoked tissues (tongue or muscle) collected from dead animals sold on the market. Sampling was done, after explaining the aim of our study, with the initial agreement of the seller and following the guidelines of the Comit\u00e9 d'Ethique Institutionnel de la recherche pour la Sant\u00e9 humaine de l'Universit\u00e9 de Douala (CEI-UDo). All the samples were preserved in 90% ethanol.",

An Illumina TruSeq nano library was built from a single DNA extract, which was enriched for simple sequence repeat content using magnetic streptavidin beads and biotin\u2010labeled CT and GT repeat oligonucleotides. The library was sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq sequencing platform using a nano 2 (500 cycles) sequencing chip. The resulting paired-end reads which passed Illumina\u2019s chastity filter were subject to de-multiplexing and trimming of Illumina adaptor residuals. Subsequently, the quality of the surviving reads was checked with the software FastQC 0.117 (https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc). In a next step, the paired-end reads were merged with the software USEARCH 10.0.240 [40] to reform in silico the sequenced molecule. The resulting reads were screened with the software Tandem Repeats Finder 4.09 [41]. After this process, 8,488 merged reads contained a microsatellite insert with a tetra- or a trinucleotide of at least six repeat units or a dinucleotide of at least 10 repeat units. Primer design was performed with Primer 3 4.1.0 [42]. Suitable primer design was possible in 6,025 microsatellite candidates. Individual tests for amplification and polymorphism of the 48 best primer-designed loci were performed on 14 individuals (from the western central African and Gabon lineages; see [17]), after which 20 polymorphic markers were retained (Table 1). Overall, eight loci were di-nucleotide, three tri-nucleotide and nine tetra-nucleotide repeats.",

The set of microsatellite loci that we have developed significantly adds to the molecular toolbox available for the species, and will hopefully contribute to the fine-scale implementation of future conservation strategies at reasonable costs. Because the previously published, cross-amplified loci were not validated on a sufficient number of geographically traceable samples, we recommend the use of our 20 newly developed microsatellite loci for population genetic studies on the white-bellied pangolin and related conservation and forensic applications.",
