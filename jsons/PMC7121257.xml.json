While terms like \u201cdisaster relief\u201d and \u201chumanitarian crisis\u201d may be more familiar, the most broadly acceptable term for these threatening situations is \u201ccomplex emergency\u201d (2). Complex emergencies (CEs) can occur anywhere and are defined as any of a number of crisis situations that greatly elevate the risk to nutrition and overall health of individuals in the affected area. Examples include natural disasters like floods and earthquakes, urban health emergencies like fires, epidemics and blackouts, and terrorist acts like massive bombings or poisonings of food or water supplies (see Table 29.2). CEs were originally associated with wars, genocide, and political strife, where innocent civilians were forced to endure loss of access to shelter, food, appropriate clothing, and timely medical care. Such emergencies have traditionally been associated with populations in developing nations, not those in the so-called developed countries. However, with increasing globalization of the world\u2019s societies and economies and news coverage documenting world events, it has become clear that CEs can and do occur in both developed and developing world locations.\n\n\n",

Some of the many factors that contribute to increased nutritional vulnerability of older adults are listed in Table 29.3. In 2001, food insecurity and hunger affected at least 1.4 million households in the United States that contained older members (3). People in 20% of those households also experienced hunger, in addition to food insecurity. Most of these older persons are suffering from food insecurity due to lack of income or due to their place of residence. Residents of the South are more apt to experience food insecurity, as are residents of cities and all elders who live alone (3).\n\n",

            "text": "Recognizing the day-to-day nutritional vulnerability of its poor and elderly citizens, the U.S. government has a number of programs in place to provide assistance to elders at risk for food insecurity and hunger. Mandated by the Older American\u2019s Act, the Elderly Nutrition Program (ENP) provides a minimum of one-third of the daily calories required by recipients through daily meals and nutrition services to people aged 60 or older in group settings, such as senior centers and churches, or in the home, through home-delivered meals. The ENP provides an average of 1 million meals per day to older Americans. These meals are targeted toward highly vulnerable elderly populations, including the very old, people living alone, people below or near the poverty line, minority populations, and individuals with significant health conditions or physical or mental impairments. On an average the meals generously meet the RDA requirements, supplying more than 33% of the Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for key nutrients, thus significantly increasing the dietary intakes of ENP participants. The meals are also \u201cnutrient dense\u201d, that is, they provide high ratios of key nutrients per calories. The most recent evaluation of the ENP program occurred in 1996 and was conducted by Mathematica Policy Research, Inc. (www.mathematica-mpr.com/nutrition/enp.asp). The resulting report clearly confirms that the ENP program recipients are at nutritional risk. It was found that between 80 and 90% of participants had incomes below 200% of the poverty level (twice the rate for the overall elderly population in the United States). More than twice as many Title III participants lived alone, compared with the overall elderly population. Approximately, two-thirds of the participants were either overweight or underweight, placing them at increased risk for nutrition and health problems. Title III home-delivered participants had more than twice as many physical impairments, compared with the overall elderly population. Although (and perhaps because) the success of the ENP program is well recognized, 41% of Title III ENP service providers have waiting lists for home-delivered meals, suggesting a significant unmet need for these meals. It would appear that even in times of relative calm and prosperity for most Americans, there are elderly citizens who are persistently in a state of nutritional crisis.",

Older Floridians who were affected by Hurricane Charley in 2004 found that the hurricane not only disrupted their quality of life but also disrupted their medical care (9). Persons with pre-existing conditions such as diabetes mellitus, heart disease, and physical disabilities were especially affected. Approximately one-third of the older residents in the area had a worsening of their conditions post-hurricane, including a lack of access to prescription medicine and loss of routine medical care for pre-existing conditions. Medically related deaths were linked to the loss of power (resulting in loss of access to oxygen) and to exacerbation of cardiac disease. Hurricane Iniki in Hawaii and the Great Hanshin-Awaji Earthquake in Japan were associated with an increase in the rate of diabetes mellitus-associated deaths for a year following the disaster (10,11).",

Due to the magnitude and scope of the destruction that occur with a major earthquake, the restoration of infrastructure to fully support the inhabitants of the region may take months or even years to be accomplished. Earthquakes result in a three-fold increase in deaths from myocardial infarction, a doubling of the frequency of strokes, increased blood pressure levels, and increased coagulability of blood (15,16). Increased rates of cardiac arrests occurring after loss of power (17) and deaths due to increased incidence of coronary heart disease (18) and myocardial infarctions (19,20) are also reported. Deterioration of mental health occurs and post-traumatic stress is also prevalent (21,22). Emotional stress can persist for months (23,21). In particular, the displacement of elderly persons from their places of residence and their social and medical supports can have a dramatic negative effect on health and quality of life (See Fig. 29.1). Displacement following a CE has been linked with a significant increase in mortality rates (15,16). The confusion of the displacement, as well as loss of access to appropriate diet and medications, prevents older individuals from monitoring and treating their medical conditions. Inappropriate diet has been directly linked to decreased glycemic control and increased mortality in diabetic patients following an earthquake (11).\n\n",

Heat disasters are often aggravated by power outages, which prevent people from keeping cool, bathing properly, and storing food at proper temperatures (24). In the 1993 heat wave in Philadelphia, there was a 26% increase in total mortality, with a 98% increase in cardiovascular deaths, particularly in those persons over 65 years of age (25). In France, during the period 1971\u20132003, there were six major heat waves, resulting in thousands of deaths; the mortality ratios increased with age after 55 years and in the over age 75 years cohort; the death rate was higher for women than for men (26).",

The spread of this epidemic was linked to the trans-global transportation of soldiers during World War I. Today, world travel and the importation of foods and other products are very common. Thus, in the event of a serious epidemic in one country, there is a high likelihood of quick transmission to others. The outbreak of SARS, a severe acute respiratory illness caused by a coronavirus, was first reported in Asia in February 2003 and spread to more than two dozen countries in North America, South America, Europe, and Asia (sickening 8,098 and killing 774) before the global outbreak was contained (http://www.cdc.gov/NCIDOD/SARS/factsheet.htm). In recognition of the severe strain that a major disease outbreak can place on health systems, the World Health Organization (WHO) advocates for an \u201cintegrated global alert and response system for epidemics and other public health emergencies\u201d that allows for \u201ca collective approach to the prevention, detection, and timely response\u201d for these emergencies (http://www.who.int/csr/en/).

Disruptions to necessities of daily living and loss of power and access to medical care would be major concerns. A bioterrorist attack would have very different potential consequences for the well-being of the elderly, potentially causing widespread illness and/or hunger and dehydration. The propagation of an illness over a wide geographical area could be lethal for a substantial number of older adults, who are typically among the most medically vulnerable. During the anthrax attacks in 2001, all emergent cases involved adults over 50 years old, with the one fatal case affecting a 94-year-old woman (30). Intentional contamination of food or water supplies with a toxin or infectious agent also has the potential to cause an outbreak of poisonings or illness over a wide geographical area. In this situation, the outbreak could be slow and/or diffuse and the cause difficult to ascertain, delaying the recognition and treatment of the problem. For example, in 2006, bagged spinach contaminated (unintentionally) by Escherichia coli infected over 200 Americans (killing three) in 26 states before the strain was isolated and eradicated. Similarly, intentional waterborne diseases or toxins would be difficult to detect and could impact a vulnerable population more severely than a healthy population, due to delayed recognition and reporting of the contamination (31). In the case of deliberate food/water contamination, nutritional health is affected directly (by reducing the availability of safe food and water) as well as indirectly (by the symptoms of illness and the reduced access to an over-burdened medical care system). In fact, the deliberate poisoning of food has already occurred in the United States, when in 1984 members of the Rajneesh religious cult contaminated salad bars in The Dalles, Oregon, with Salmonella typhimurium. Though it was only a trial run for a more extensive attack that was planned to disrupt local elections later that year, the contamination caused 751 people to develop salmonellosis in a 2-week period. Other isolated examples of intentional food contaminations have also been reported in the United States and Canada (32).",

Sometimes the effects are immediate, but more often an increase in morbidity and mortality occurs progressively after the disaster as survivors experience a continued decrease in the quality of life and increased nutritional risk due to displacement and a loss of basic resources. These events result in increased disability, which further impairs the ability of older persons to maintain access to safe food and water and sustain proper nutrition and hydration, and so the spiral continues downward.

The basis for current governmental and humanitarian responses to nutritional crises builds on lessons learned in the earliest organized relief efforts (circa 1940\u20131950). During the 1970s, guidelines began to be published following experiences with relief efforts in places like Biafra and Ethiopia (2). In the subsequent decades, the experiences of various crises have progressively shaped what are, today, the characteristic challenges, and avenues of support available to older adults who are caught in CE situations in any given country. With increasing recognition that the elderly are uniquely vulnerable to CEs, efforts are underway to develop specific recommendations and resources for this population group. Table 29.5 lists some of the resources available, along with web links. HelpAge International (www.helpage.org) is a global network of more than 70 not-for-profit organizations in 50 countries who are working for improvements in the lives of older people. This group has published a manual of guidelines for best practice during disasters and humanitarian crises (See Table 29.5). The Sphere Project Minimum Standards in Disaster Response project (http://www.sphereproject.org/content/view/27/84) advocates for the use of community-based systems to implement the care of older individuals in these circumstances. In the United States, a number of national organizations, including the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), The American Red Cross, and various branches of the military take responsibility for rescue and relief efforts following a major CE but the contribution of the private sector to the relief effort is traditionally also a substantial one. This type of broad-based support is necessary but makes it more difficult to consistently implement age-related guidelines for relief efforts once they are in the field. Coordinating the advance preparation efforts for CEs, however, is a more tangible goal.\n\n",

The specifics of these requirements vary on a state-by-state basis. However, attention to the development of specialized evacuation plans (individualized for resident needs) is more focused since the nursing home-related deaths recorded during the hurricanes on the gulf coast in 2005. Two such incidents included the drowning of 34 nursing home residents in St. Bernard Parish, Louisiana, due to a failure to comply with evacuation orders during Hurricane Katrina, and the bus accident in which 24 Houston, Texas, nursing home residents being evacuated from Hurricane Rita died in a fire that was sparked by mechanical problems and fed by the explosions of the passengers\u2019 oxygen tanks.",

The trainees were then taught what other materials should be added to the kit to make it appropriate for a particular individual (Table 29.6). Upon completion of this training each of the 150 trainees received two complete kits, one to use as an example during their subsequent training sessions of other health-care providers and the other to be given to a disadvantaged older person whom they deemed at risk during an emergency.

However, a review of the disruptive weather patterns in the 11 counties in eastern Missouri and southwestern Illinois where the trainees (and therefore, presumably of the older adults receiving the extra kits) lived, indicated that three area-wide power outages had occurred between August 2006 and January 2007. All of these three power failures lasted 1\u20133 weeks, with the rural areas in southwestern Illinois being the last to get power restored each time. Each of these power failures affected at least a half million citizens each time. Numerous cooling or heating stations were set up for older adults, thereby allowing them to evacuate from their homes during the days in August and to receive warm meals during the November and January power failures. Multiple public service announcements encouraged people to evacuate their homes completely until power was restored, so many older adults either moved in with relatives who did have power or went to hotels. Under those conditions, it is reasonable to expect older persons to take their emergency kits with them. Many of the health-care provider trainees reported that they had gone to work daily. A brief second query to 10 trainees who had used their kits and 10 trainees who had not used their kits indicated that both sets had gone to work daily and returned home at night, even if they had no power at home. (These health-care providers worked in facilities with working generators.) Several of those that took their kits with them indicated that the kits provided them with some measure of safety while traveling icy roads in November and January. Those that had not used their kits indicated no perceived change in their normal safety.",

Community-dwelling older adults appear to be more vulnerable to weather emergencies than are the health-care providers who care for them, as evidenced by the differences in usage rates of the kits by both groups through three lengthy power outages. Upon review of the barriers that prevented trainees from providing training to other health-care providers, it is possible that it would have been more appropriate to provide train-the-trainer programs to older adults rather than to health-care providers. Peer-to-peer training might have had the added advantage of motivating trainers to find community funding to make kits for distribution because of a greater perceived personal need for the kits.",

However, water should not be rationed due to the very rapid effects of dehydration. Individuals are advised to drink what is needed today and search for more water on a daily basis. Indicators of dehydration in the elderly differ from those in younger individuals; increased thirst, reduced skin turgor are not reliable markers. Better indicators include tongue dryness, longitudinal tongue furrows, dry mucous membranes of the nose and mouth, eyes that appear sunken, upper body weakness, speech difficulty, and confusion (34).",

Access to the aid is a concern because disabilities and medical problems may prevent elderly individuals from reaching the distribution centers. Another concern is the composition of the food rations, which may not be appropriate in consistency for persons who have dentures or who lack teeth and that may not be adequate in nutritional composition. Food rations vary in composition; not all are developed for the primary purpose of post-CE relief. In the United States, the Meal, Ready-to-Eat (MRE), although first developed for use in the space program and now widely used by the armed forces, is one form of ration that is commonly distributed to civilians who need food following CEs. Having been designed for soldiers in a high activity situation, the MREs are much higher in sodium (5,500 g) and fat (136 g) than is optimal, especially for older adults (36). Likewise, the texture, packaging, and preparation of MREs were not developed with the intention of use by older adults.",

Additionally, medical facilities will vary in their ability to handle the CE, depending on the type of emergency. For example, the response to a CE such as a hurricane (which would probably slow down access to the facility) would be very different than that required for an infectious disease epidemic (when admissions might very quickly exceed capacity) (40). The challenge for the clinician on the front line is to stabilize the older patient until access to more formal support can be restored.
