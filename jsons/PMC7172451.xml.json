Recommended agents included drugs available at the time of publication, with both intramuscular and oral drugs listed, such as procaine penicillin, ampicillin, erythromycin, co-trimoxazole, and sulfamethoxypyridazine, and noted that there was as yet little experience with co-trimoxazole. Second-line agents for use in children still ill after 48 h included chloramphenicol or oxacillin.",

A 2005 technical update of the WHO IMCI guidelines recommended oral amoxicillin (50 mg/kg per dose, in two divided doses) or co-trimoxazole (8 mg/kg trimethoprim per dose, in two divided doses) for the treatment of non-severe pneumonia;9 if antimicrobial resistance to co-trimoxazole was high, oral amoxicillin was preferred.",

For the selection of antimicrobial agents, 36 articles that assessed more than one antimicrobial agent and the seven articles that assessed different durations or doses of antimicrobial agents by use of a randomised controlled trial were included in the review. Articles were excluded if no treatment failure data were available as an outcome or if they exclusively enrolled children with very severe pneumonia. If an article presented results of children with a spectrum of diagnosis (eg, sinusitis, otitis media, and pneumonia) only results for children with pneumonia were included, if possible.

Non-severe pneumonia is diagnosed in a child with cough or difficulty breathing accompanied by tachypnoea, defined as a respiratory rate of at least 40 breaths per min in a child aged 12\u201359 months, or at least 50 breaths per min in an infant aged 2\u201311 months. Use of these criteria identifies 80% of children with pneumonia who need antimicrobial therapy.7 Children aged 2\u201359 months require immediate referral if they have signs of severe or very severe pneumonia (lower chest indrawing or central cyanosis), stridor when calm, or IMCI-defined danger signs (inability to drink or breastfeed, convulsions, persistent vomiting, lethargy, or unconsciousness). Children aged less than 2 months with pneumonia have, by definition, severe pneumonia due to their higher risk for mortality, and thus require referral.",

If a child develops signs indicative of the need for immediate referral, before or after treatment is initiated, they should be referred immediately.7, 9 We believe that children who fail to improve but do not require immediate referral should be systematically assessed before changing antimicrobial agents. This assessment can begin with the first-level health worker determining whether failure is due to inability or unwillingness to take the medicine appropriately. If the health worker believes that the child has taken the antimicrobial agent correctly, other conditions resulting in treatment failure should be considered. If an initial assessment by the health worker indicates that these considerations are unlikely and referral is not warranted, a second-line agent should expand coverage.",

Therefore, if a child has clinical features of non-severe pneumonia but malaria cannot be excluded, the recommended first-line therapies for malaria and pneumonia should both be prescribed. Caution should be exercised in the use of erythromycin as a second-line agent if mefloquine or halofantrine are prescribed for malaria, due to the increased the risk of arrhythmia.",

These updated recommendations, now identifying amoxicillin as the preferred first-line agent and specifying the approach to changing to an appropriate second-line agent in the event of treatment failure (table 1), aim to improve treatment protocols for first-level health providers for children with non-severe pneumonia. These recommendations were developed by use of the available evidence for the treatment of children with pneumonia in low-income countries. The evidence basis for some of the recommendations was limited, and more research is needed in several areas. These areas include an improved understanding of the aetiology of pneumonia in children, both severe and non-severe, using optimum diagnostic testing, a better understanding of the reasons for treatment failure, and the determination of the best systematic method for the assessment of treatment failure by first-level health workers. In the meantime, adaptation of these general recommendations to fit country-specific treatment algorithms should help to resolve some of the uncertainty surrounding the appropriate management of young children with non-severe pneumonia.",
