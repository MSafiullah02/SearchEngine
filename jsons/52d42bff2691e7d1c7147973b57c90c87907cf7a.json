Exons 1, 1bis, and 2 encode 5 0 untranslated sequences; exon 3 encodes the initiation codon and the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domain; 20 short exons (exons 4-23) encode most of the extracellular region; and exon 24 encodes the C-terminal 32 amino acids of the protein and contains the entire 3 0 untranslated region (UTR). Within exon 24 are five poly (A) addition signals. Alternative splicing of exon 1, exon 1bis, exon 2 (2a), or part of exon 2 (2b) to the common exon 3, resulting in four different transcripts, may be the origin of the tissue-specific or stage of development-specific expression of NEP [3] . Indeed, two separate regulatory elements have been found in the NEP promoter region and these elements may be regulated by the transcription factor CBF/ NF-Y in a tissue-specific manner. A cDNA clone lacking the complete exon 16 has been isolated from human lung tissue [4] . Deletion of this 27 amino acid segment was shown to reduce enzyme activity to barely detectable levels. However, the physiological relevance of this truncated enzyme remains to be determined. In the rat, an exon 5-18 deletion has been described, but no evidence was found to support the expression of this truncated variant in the human lung.",

Target cells express both NEP and the peptide-receptor; by degrading the peptide substrate, NEP reduces the local concentration of the peptide available for binding to the receptor. For example, NEP reduces ANF-mediated hypotension, fMLPmediated chemotaxis of neutrophils, and enkephalinmediated analgesia. Targeted disruption of the NEP locus in mice results in enhanced lethality to endotoxin, indicating an important protective role for NEP in septic shock. A role for NEP in lymphoid development has been suggested by studies showing that inhibition of NEP results in increased proliferation and maturation of B cells, both in vitro and in vivo [8] . Therefore, it has been suggested that NEP functions to regulate B-cell development by inactivating a peptide that stimulates B-cell proliferation and differentiation. Alternatively, NEP may activate a pro-peptide that inhibits proliferation and differentiation of B cells. The role of NEP in the regulation of cellular proliferation and differentiation in the lung is discussed next in more detail. The role of NEP in the modulation of neurogenic inflammation will be discussed further on.",

BLP are potent growth factors for bronchial epithelial cells and are involved in lung development. The temporal and cellular patterns of NEP expression implicate the enzyme in the regulation of BLP-mediated fetal lung development. Indeed, both in vitro and in vivo, it was shown that inhibition of NEP resulted in increased maturation of the developing fetal lung [10] . Reduced NEP activity may also promote BLP-mediated proliferation of bronchial epithelial cells. Indeed, the growth and proliferation of BLP-dependent carcinomas is inhibited by NEP and potentiated by NEP inhibition [9] . NEP expression by epithelial cells is inversely correlated with cellular proliferation. Therefore, reduced NEP activity may promote BLPmediated proliferation and facilitate the development of small-cell carcinomas of the lung [9] . A role for NEP in the regulation of tumour cell proliferation is also supported by studies using a human T-cell line (Jurkat). In these cells, NEP is required for phorbol ester-induced growth arrest.",

APN is a glycoprotein of 967 amino acids with 11 potential sites of asparagine-linked oligosaccharide addition [11] . The unglycosylated protein has a molecular size of 110 kDa; post-translational modification results in the 130-kDa precursor (gp130) and the 150-kDa mature protein (gp150) [12] . The 23-amino acid retained signal also functions as the membrane-spanning segment, orientating the APN N-terminus inside and the C-terminus outside the cell (thereby defining APN as a type II integral membrane protein) [11] . The intracellular domain of APN is only nine amino acids long, whereas the extracellular domain contains 935 amino acids. Similar to NEP, the extracellular domain contains a pentapeptide consensus sequence characteristic of members of the zinc-binding metalloprotease family. On the surface of cells, APN is expressed as a non-covalently bound homodimer. Cloning of the APN cDNA revealed that its sequence was identical to the myeloid marker CD13 [11, 12] .",

However, expression of APN on lymphocytes can be induced after mitogenic stimulation or after adhesion to fibroblast-like synoviocytes, endothelial cells, epithelial cells and monocytes/macrophages. In the human bronchus, APN is present on blood vessels, connective tissue, glandular ducts, nerves, perichondrium, and leucocytes (predominantly mononuclear phagocytes, dendritic cells, and granulocytes) [7] .",

The extracellular domain, which contains nine potential glycosylation sites, can be divided into three regions: an N-terminal glycosylated region containing seven glycosylation sites and starting with a 20-amino acid flexible 'stalk region'; a cysteine-rich region; and a 260-amino acid C-terminal domain containing the putative catalytic sequence. On the surface of cells, DPP IV probably is present as a homodimer comprising two identical subunits of approximately 110-kDa molecular mass.

In the human bronchus, DPP IV is strongly present in serosal submucosal glands [7] . The expression of DPP IV on haematopoietic cells is regulated stringently. DPP IV is absent from the majority of human resting peripheral blood T lymphocytes, but some subsets of resting peripheral blood T cells weakly express the molecule. DPP IV expression on T lymphocytes is increased after T-cell activation. Thus, DPP IV is a suitable marker for T cells activated in vivo. Recent data indicate that DPP IV expression on T cells may correlate with T-helper (TH) subsets [19] . High DPP IV expression was found on TH1 and TH0 cells, whereas TH2 cells displayed lower expression of DPP IV. The amount of IL-4 secretion was responsible for this correlation [19] . Memory T cells have been reported to reside in the DPP IV-positive T-cell fraction, although this was not found in another study.

Peptides with alanine in the penultimate position may also be cleaved, although with a much lower efficiency. Since N-termini-containing X-Pro are not easily cleaved by other peptidases, the action of DPP IV is a rate-limiting step in the degradation of such peptides. Several biologically active peptides have the X-Pro sequence at their N-terminus and therefore DPP IV may play an important role in modulating their action. These peptides include SP and bradykinin. Hydrolysis of SP by DPP IV yields two products (SP 3-11 and SP [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] ) which both are more potent bronchoconstrictors than intact SP [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] .

Stimulation of DPP IV (using monoclonal antibodies) leads to the activation of all functional programs of the T cells, including cytotoxicity and production of IL-2. This activation requires the expression of the TCR and DPP IV enzymatic activity. Furthermore, antibody-induced cross-linking of DPP IV-induced tyrosine phosphorylation of several intracellular proteins with a similar pattern to that seen after TCR/CD3 stimulation [20] . Co-cross-linking of DPP IV and CD3 antigens induced prolonged and increased tyrosine phosphorylation in comparison with CD3 alone, indicating that DPP IV is a true costimulatory entity [20] . In addition to T-cell activation, anti-DPP IV-stimulated T cells show enhanced proliferative responses, increased CD3 (phosphorylation and increased p56 lck activity. One possible mechanism for the enhanced response of T cells to perturbation of DPP IV was suggested by the demonstration that CD45, a tyrosine phosphatase that positively regulates TCR signalling, coprecipitates with DPP IV [21] . Thus, DPP IV antibodies may stimulate T-cell proliferation in part by decreasing CD45-mediated dephosphorylation of key substrates.",

In a rat study, repeated subcutaneous injection of DPP IV inhibitors reduced serum DPP IV activities to levels less than 30% of the normal [23] . When primary, secondary or tertiary immune responses to bovine serum albumin (BSA) were evoked in these animals, they showed reduced anti-BSA antibody production.

Stimulation of sensory nerves, either by chemical or physical triggers, results in an axon reflex and subsequent release of neuropeptides from the peripheral endings of the sensory nerves. Following release, these neuropeptides exert a variety of effects through activation of specific neurokinin receptors, including vasodilation, increased microvascular permeability, leucocyte recruitment and adhesion, submucosal gland secretion, smooth muscle contraction, cough, and facilitation of cholinergic neurotransmission. This sequence of events is now known as 'neurogenic inflammation' [34] . Since the neurogenic inflammatory response mimics many of the pathophysiological features of asthma, a role for neuropeptides in the pathogenesis of asthma has been implicated. In the asthmatic airways, the effects of bronchoconstrictor peptides (including tachykinins and bradykinin) may be enhanced, whereas the effects of bronchodilator peptides (including VIP) may be reduced.",

In the first study, it was shown that selective inhibition of NEP potentiated the secretagogue effect of SP on submucosal gland secretion in the ferret trachea in vivo. Several other reports subsequently demonstrated that inhibition of NEP potentiated the effects of SP on cough, vascular permeability, cholinergic neurotransmission, and smooth muscle contraction. In guinea-pigs, it was shown that both NEP and ACE participate in the metabolism of SP when administered intravascularly, whilst SP administered by aerosol was degraded by NEP only. In addition, the ACE inhibitor captopril did not affect TK-induced bronchial smooth muscle contraction in man. Therefore, ACE is thought to play an important role in modulating the biological activity of intravascular peptides, whereas NEP is also involved in the hydrolysis of peptides present within lung tissue or within the bronchial lumen. The importance of NEP in modulating tachykinin-mediated effects is further supported by the observation that administration of other peptidase inhibitors (including inhibitors of aminopeptidases, serine proteases, and carboxypeptidases), did not potentiate tachykinin-induced effects in the airways. The involvement of NEP in the breakdown of tachykinins has also been shown in in vivo studies in humans. These studies showed that both NKA-and SP-induced bronchoconstriction could be potentiated by NEP inhibition [36, 37] .",

The possibility that tachykinins are endogenously released in vivo has also been supported by the observation that bradykinin-induced bronchoconstriction in asthmatics can be blocked by a tachykinin receptor antagonist [49] (although this could not be confirmed in some other studies) and can be potentiated by NEP inhibition. Bradykinin, which is present in the asthmatic airways and is released after relevant aeroallergen challenge in allergic individuals, can stimulate sensory nerves to induce retrograde release of tachykinins. Increased levels of (neuro)peptides in the airways of asthmatic patients may contribute both to acute and chronic inflammatory abnormalities. In addition to their acute effects, such as the constriction of airway smooth muscle, the secretion of mucus, and vasodilation [34] , several studies have shown that (neuro)peptides possess a wide number of immunomodulatory effects and may be involved in tissue repair responses [50] . Interestingly, several types of leucocytes, including eosinophils and macrophages, are able to produce and release SP themselves, further supporting a role for these molecules in immunological reactions. Thus, dysfunction of peptidases may result in exaggerated immunological responses and thereby contribute to the development and/or maintenance of the inflammatory process. Inhibition of NEP, either in healthy subjects or asthmatics, has been shown to potentiate the bronchoconstrictor effects of mediators known to be released after allergen challenge (such as LTD 4 and bradykinin). However, inhibition of NEP at doses shown to enhance the bronchoconstrictor effect of NKA did not affect the early and late-phase response in mild asthmatics following allergen challenge [45] . This may suggest that endogenously released neuropeptides do not play a role in antigen-induced airway responses. Alternatively, antigen challenge may result in a dysfunction of NEP activity. To further determine whether peptidases and neuropeptides contribute to asthma, in vivo studies using selective neurokinin receptor antagonists should be performed both in the presence and absence of NEP or other peptidase inhibitors. Neurokinin receptor antagonists should first be tested against tachykinin-induced bronchoconstriction in order to determine the optimal dose of the antagonists. Second, the effects of these antagonists should be analysed in allergen-induced bronchoconstriction, both in the absence and in the presence of peptidase inhibitors. Furthermore, it would be interesting to treat allergic asthmatics with appropriate neurokinin receptor antagonists (either intravascular or by inhalation) for a longer period of time, and to determine whether this affects allergen-induced bronchoconstriction and bronchial inflammation (as determined by analysis of bronchial biopsies and BAL fluid). This will give insight in the contribution of tachykinins to the (chronic) inflammatory process in the airways of asthmatic patients. Finally, the contribution of tachykinins and peptidases in asthma may be demonstrated by treating asthmatic patients with recombinant NEP, and analysing the effects on bronchoconstriction induced by allergens or environmental agents such as cigarette smoke. If it appears that (neuro)peptides and peptidases are indeed involved in the pathogenesis of asthma, selective receptor antagonists or recombinant peptidases may be useful in the therapy of asthma.",

Neuropeptides (Q)released from sensory nerves are normally rapidly degraded by peptidases. Therefore the effects of these neuropeptides are limited. In the asthmatic airways, several factors may result in a decreased peptidase activity, thereby exaggerating the neuropeptide effects. Adapted from reference[33].",
