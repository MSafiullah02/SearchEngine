Avian influenza (AI) is a leading cause of morbidity, mortality, and economic loss in many countries. Mammals can also be infected with several AIV subtypes, including H5N1, H9N2, H7N7, and H7N3 [5, 6]. In 1997, 18 people were infected with avian H5N1 influenza virus and six died, refocusing global attention on the potential role of AIVs as precursors of human pandemic influenza virus strains [7, 8]. The H9N2 strain has been isolated from pigs and humans with influenza-like illnesses in Hong Kong and mainland China since 1998 [9, 10]. These findings indicate that the AIV can also cross species barriers and expand its host range from birds to mammals, thus highlighting the pandemic potential of the H9N2 virus.",

AIV is well known to mainly cause pneumonia, severe acute lung injury (ALI), and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in humans [17]. A clinically important pronounced activation of the proinflammatory cytokine cascade perpetuates the inflammatory response and may contribute to further tissue damage and persistence of the systemic inflammatory response syndrome, leading to pulmonary infection in both animals and humans [18, 19]. We therefore hypothesized that improving immune regulation would benefit the treatment of AI.",

Importantly, recent studies have demonstrated that bone marrow-derived MSCs can exhibit immunosuppressive properties. In addition, MSCs have been suggested to be \u201cimmune evasive\u201d, and thus protected from rejection, which potentially permits their use in allotransplantation [25, 26]. MSCs may also engraft in the injured lung and can even differentiate into lung epithelial cells in vivo [27]. Therefore, MSCs may be beneficial in the treatment of AI.",

Marrow-derived stem cells are hypothesized to be the source of lung regeneration and repair. An alternative source are exogenous stem/progenitor cells, delivered into the lung either intravenously via the trachea or by direct injection. Recently, many studies have confirmed that MSCs can engraft in the injured lung [37\u201339] and can even differentiate into lung epithelial cells in vivo. MSCs may also exhibit immunosuppressive properties, suggesting \u201cimmune-privilege\u201d, and may even have certain immune regulation functions [40\u201342]. Therefore, MSCs may, in their own right, have beneficial effects in ALI.",

However, MSC treatment decreases the expression of these chemokines. We also showed that MSC-treated mice have significantly reduced levels of some inflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u03b1, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, and IFN-\u03b3) and a corresponding increase in anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10). It is believed that IL-1\u03b1, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, and IFN-\u03b3 play important roles in the development of ALI [43]. These results are consistent with several previous studies. For example, in Mei\u2019s study, treatment with MSCs alone significantly reduced LPS-induced acute pulmonary inflammation in mice [39]. Importantly, our in vivo experimental results suggest that the administration of MSCs can greatly improve the hypoxemia and histopathological changes of lung injury induced by H9N2 AIV infection. The data indicate that administration of MSCs results in a marked increase in survival rates, primarily due to a decrease in ALI. These results are not consistent with the findings of Lam et al. [44], who reported that MSC therapy fails to improve outcomes in experimental HIN1 influenza. We speculate that this might be a consequence of different pathogenic characteristics of different influenza viruses. It is known that avian influenza virus infection can lead to a \u201ccytokine storm\u201d. In consequence, the host cellular response may be different from that with H1N1 influenza virus infection.",

These beneficial effects may be mediated by the downregulation of chemokines such as GM-CSF, MCP-1, KC, MIP-1\u03b1, and MIG, leading to the downregulation of inflammatory cytokines such as TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b1, IL-6, and IFN-\u03b3. Our findings provide further support for a prominent role of TLR4-dependent immune regulation in acute lung injury therapy. The quantity of stem cells used in our study was 1 \u00d7 105. This is much less than used by Wang et al. [45]. We did not find an obvious stem cell niche in the lung tissue of mice. Therefore, we deduce that the immune regulation function of stem cells is via a paracrine mechanism.",
