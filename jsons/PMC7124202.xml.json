Seventy percent of patients in the ward who turned out to have positive influenza were empirically treated with antibiotics, and only a quarter of them discontinued the treatment given the MRVP result. The suspicion of a concomitant presence of a secondary bacterial infection is the most likely explanation for the continuation of antibiotic in these cases. However, the small sample size of this study precluded our ability to study this hypothesis in greater depth. Moreover, the introduction, use, and interpretation of this MRVP test is relatively new to our institution, and clinical practice may have not changed yet.

We could not further analyze the role of comorbidity on the continuous use of antibiotics or antivirals because almost all of the treated patients had a comorbidity. In future studies, a finer definition of comorbidity and suspicion of a bacterial respiratory infection would be needed to investigate the reasons for continuation of antibiotic use. Another limitation of this work is that we were not able to measure the impact of the MRVP test on infection control because of the lack of individual-level data on initiation of these measures.",
