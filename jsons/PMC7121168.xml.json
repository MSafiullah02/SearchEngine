Post-transcriptional silencing occurs by mRNA engagement with small interfering RNA (siRNA) or microRNA (miRNA) facilitated by complementary base pairing [3]. Gene specificity coupled with the capability for externally introduced synthetic siRNA and miRNA to be recruited into the cellular RNAi pathway provides the rational for RNAi drug development. A greater understanding of the molecular mechanism of RNAi has resulted in a wide repertoire of potential RNAi drugs involved in the RNAi pathway cascade that offers diverse therapeutic options.",

Improvements in both extracellular and intracellular delivery are key to the therapeutic success of RNAi therapeutics.

The mucus layer thickness determines the accessibility to the underlying \u00adepithelium and depends on both luminal conditions and functional requirements of the underlying tissue. The layer thickness varies along the human gastrointestinal tract with the thickest layer in the stomach (\u223c50\u2013450 \u03bcm) [19] and in the colon (\u223c110\u2013160 \u03bcm) [20]. In the eyes, the thickness of the mucus layer has been reported to be 30\u201340 \u03bcm [21, 22], in the airway 7\u201330 \u03bcm [23\u201325] and in the bronchiole \u223c55 \u03bcm [26]. The most accessible mucosal surfaces are found in the nasal region [27] due to a very thin layer of mucus, and in the deep lung where the epithelial lining is devoid of mucus and instead contains surfactants which reduces the surface tension and potentiates gas transfer in the alveoli [28]. Relevant to mucosal therapeutic delivery is the thickness and integrity of the mucus layer may be compromised under various pathological conditions. For example increase in mucus thickness has been observed in asthma [29], cystic fibrosis [26] and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease [30], whilst a decrease in thickness has been observed in ulcerative colitis [20]. This variation in mucus thickness can lead to a predisposition for disease or be induced by pathological consequences of the disease such as loss of epithelial integrity as seen in ulcerative colitis.",

            "text": "The protective properties of mucus pose a barrier to RNAi-based therapeutics both in naked or nanoparticle form. Mucus constituents such as the glycoproteins (mucins), cellular debris and lipids form a heterogeneous environment through which drugs and/or drug carriers need to diffuse to reach their target [38]. Glycosylated domains of the mucin fibres possess a negative charge under physiological conditions, and hence mucus selectively controls the diffusion of particles not only through particle physical parameters such as size, but also by their chemical surface properties. Based on the net negative charge of mucins, one could speculate that naked siRNA might be repelled by the mucin fibres. Multivalent interactions between particles and the mucus network are main determinants of particle diffusion. Both electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions occur, and the possibility of making large numbers of non-specific hydrophobic interactions together with the more thermal stable electrostatic interactions enables mucus to trap particles. Several studies have demonstrated the efficacy of hydrophobic interactions to \u00adimmobilise particles within mucus [38\u201341] and Ribbeck and co-workers have shown that particle surface charge, density and pH of mucin hydrogels can alter particle diffusion [42]. Particles with a PEGylated surface possessing a neutral charge had a greater diffusion rate compared to its negative or positive charged counterpart [42]. Two approaches govern the design of particles for mucosal delivery (1) the mucoadhesive and (2) mucus penetrative approach.",

            "text": "Regarding the mucoadhesive strategy, much attention has been given to the design of particles which associate with the mucus barrier and hence lower the clearance rate. The essence of this strategy lies with the previously mentioned bi-layered structure of mucus. Association of particles with the lower undisturbed layer will avoid clearance and enhance the bioavailability of the bioactive entity. Another positive effect from mucus association is increased viscosity due to greater cross-linking of mucus fibres, which in turn may lower the clearance rate. Materials of choice have been the so-called mucoadhesive materials. A common characteristic of these materials is their adherence to mucus through various forces. A widely used mucoadhesive polymer is chitosan [43], which have been utilised to form particles with siRNA and exhibit mucosal silencing [7]. Thiolation of polymers have been shown to enhance mucus interaction through formation of disulfide linkages with mucins [44] and various thiolated chitosan\u2019s have been synthesised [45, 46]. Not only does the mucoadhesiveness prolong the bioavailability of particles at mucosal surfaces, but it can also alter the structure of mucus so that it becomes more permeable to siRNA-loaded particles [47]. As an alternative, mucus-penetrating particle with limited interaction with mucus and increased diffusion rates is an exciting approach. Coating with PEG has been demonstrated to mediate such surface properties on latex particles (200\u2013500 nm) [48] and nanoparticles composed of a biodegradable di-block copolymer of poly (sebacic acid) and PEG [49]. It has been further shown that both molecular weight and degree of surface coverage determined the mobility of the coated particles [50]. Reports, however, have previously classified PEG as a mucoadhesive polymer [51\u201353]. As speculated by Lai et al. the contradicting reports might be attributable to variations in type of PEGylation used, but the use of PEG-coated particles have yet to demonstrate intracellular delivery of nucleic acids to the respiratory or gastrointestinal tract. Interestingly, the design of mucus-penetrating particles builds on lessons learned from nature where viruses with an equal surface density of positive and negative charges readily penetrate mucus barriers [54]. Thus, surface chemistry together with size appear to be determining factors for mucus penetration and evidence points towards neutral surfaces for effective diffusion.",

As a consequence, its anatomical and cellular features restrict material adsorption that includes naked siRNA or nanoparticle-based delivery systems. The trachea divides into the two primary bronchi at the carina, after which, heavy branching from the lobular bronchi occurs and then onto continuously narrowing tubes to the respiratory segment beginning with the respiratory bronchioles and the alveolar ducts and sacs. Delivery of siRNA to the lungs, whether naked or incorporated in a particle, needs to address the branching of airways and the mucus layer covering the conducting segments. Ciliated cells are abundant in the nasal cavity and trachea, with apical cilia working in coordinated sweeps to transport mucus along with trapped material towards the oesophagus. The constant removal of mucus by the ciliated cells, termed the \u201cmucociliary escalator\u201d plays a critical role in preventing inhaled particulates and pathogens from residing within the trachea and the upper bronchiolar tree. The respiratory mucus consists of an outer luminal layer and an inner layer (termed periciliary liquid) in direct contact with the cilia. Under normal physiological conditions, the luminal mucus layer is refreshed every 10\u201320 min, whereas renewal of the underlying layer is cleared much slower [38]. The mucus layer is swept away and replenished continually requiring trapped material or nanoparticles to diffuse across a current gradient in order to reach the epithelial surface [17].",

Furthermore, surfactant that covers the deeper regions to prevent collapse of the respiratory sections during exhalation may interfere with particle integrity [57], leaving the siRNA exposed to enzymatic degradation. Alveoli macrophages that compensate for the lack of mucus protection are able to scavenge foreign material by extending processes into the lumen of the alveolus.

In an interesting study from 2005, Bitko et al. demonstrated that naked phosphoprotein-specific anti-RSV siRNA (70 \u03bcg single dose) performed near equally as siRNA complexed with the commercial transfection agent Mirus TKO in a RSV mouse model. In this study, viral titres were reduced several logs after intranasal administration with no adverse or immunostimulatory effects observed [63]. Alvarez et al. likewise, was able to reduce RSV titres (2.5\u20133 log reduction, 100 \u03bcg single dose) using the naked Alnylam siRNA against RSV nucleocapsid gene (ALN-RSV01) after intranasal delivery in mice. By RACE analysis of the ALN-RSV01 cleavage product, it was also confirmed that the reduction of the viral titre was in fact an RNAi-mediated effect [76]. Recently, the results from an Alnylam phase II clinical trial was published showing a 38% reduction of experimentally RSV infected test subjects receiving ALN-RSV01 (150 mg) compared to subjects receiving a placebo [14]. A nasal spray was used to deliver the PBS/ALN-RSV01 solution. As mentioned by the authors of the report, the induced RSV infection in the study resulted in a mild to moderate upper respiratory tract illness in the region the nasal spray is likely to reach. Studies are currently underway to evaluate the effect of ALN-RSV01 in naturally infected patients, and these are likely to use aerosolised delivery methods in order to reach both the upper and lower respiratory segments simultaneously. The success achieved in studies using non-formulated siRNA is unexpected when one considers the polyionic nature of the siRNA molecule that restricts cellular uptake. A possible explanation could be loss of epithelial integrity due to infection that might allow entry of naked siRNA. Nonetheless, at the time of writing, the Alnylam RSV programme is one of the most advanced RNAi clinical trial programmes and the simplistic naked siRNA approach could fulfil the clinical requirement of cost-effectiveness.",

Modification of the siRNA backbone, however, is now standard to reduce serum degradation [77]. In a recent study, serum stability and silencing of enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) in the bronchoepithelium of mice have been demonstrated after i.v. administration of naked LNA modified siRNAs [66]. Intravenous injections of naked LNA modified siRNA (five doses of 50 \u03bcg siRNA) resulted in comparable reduction of EGFP (55% reduction) in the bronchoepithelium as animals dosed intranasally with chitosan/siRNA particles (single 30 \u03bcg dose). Naked modified siRNA was less effective after intranasal dosing. The authors suggest that the success of the naked modified siRNA to reach the lung epithelium after i.v. injection might result from increased serum stability, allowing for longer circulation time compared to unmodified siRNAs.",

It is a deacetylated derivative of the natural polymer chitin and is composed of randomly distributed repeating units of \u03b2 (1,4)-N-acetyl-d-glucosamine and \u03b2 (1,4)-d-glucosamine and is non-toxic, biocompatible and biodegradable [79]. The cationic glucosamine component facilitates mucoadhesion, mucopermeation and polyplex formation. It is involved in transient opening of epithelial tight junctions improving paracellular drug transport [80, 81]. Moreover, it adheres to the mucus layer by interaction with sialic acid in mucus glycoproteins that increases viscosity, leading to decreased mucociliary clearance and prolonged residence time [43, 82]. The cationic amine has been utilised for entropy-driven formation of sub-micron particles with polyanionic DNA [83] and siRNA [84]. Chitosan has demonstrated excellent transfection abilities and several in vivo studies have revealed the ability of chitosan to enhance respiratory delivery of siRNAs and DNA. A study by K\u00f6ping-H\u00f6gg\u00e5rd et al. achieved expression of \u03b2-galactosidase after intratracheal delivery of chitosan/DNA polyplexes [85] and another study managed to partly immunise mice from RSV by intranasal application of chitosan/DNA particles coding for RSV epitopes [86].",

Mirus TKO, a cationic lipid/polymer formulation, has been used by Bitko et al. to deliver siRNA against RSV [63]. 70 \u03bcg siRNA delivered intranasally with Mirus TKO was able to reduce viral titres in mice without inducing an interferon response, an effect shown to be a 20\u201330% improvement on naked siRNA. In a mouse influenza model, the animals received hydrodynamic injections (3.78 nmol) of naked siRNA followed 16\u201324 h later by intranasal delivered oligofectamine/siRNA (1.51 nmol) complexes against the viral nucleoprotein and acidic polymerase to reduce viral titres in the lung (63-fold compared to EGFP siRNA) [71]. Whilst interferon levels were investigated and found not to be upregulated, concerns remain for the use of the EGFP sequence as a negative control due to its non-stimulatory uniqueness [101]. A third commercial lipid-based transfection reagent, DharmaFECT, has been used as a pulmonary delivery vector in a bleomycin-induced lung fibrosis mouse model [72]. siRNA against SPARC, a matricellular protein overexpressed in fibrotic diseases, markedly reduced collagen content in the lung (58%) compared to the bleomycin-only group after intratracheal dosing (3  \u00d7  3 \u03bcg siRNA).",

The mass median aerodynamic diameter (MMAD) is the diameter at which 50% of the particle/droplet distribution by mass will have a larger or smaller diameter. In other words, if deposition at a specific airway depth is required and is achieved at a given aerodynamic diameter (e.g. 5 \u03bcm), then if the MMAD of an aerosol is 5 \u03bcm, then 50% of the total aerosol mass will in principle deposit above the selected depth and 50% will deposit below.

Particles with an aerodynamic diameter between 1 and 5 \u03bcm are likely to reach the pulmonary regions, whereas larger particles will be deposited in the upper airways [55]. However, if particles become too small, they are prone to being exhaled before depositing. This means solid nanoparticles, per definition, are in principle too small to be effectively deposited in the lungs, and a large portion of these particles may end up leaving the lung again after inhalation. There are two solutions to this problem. Either the particles are kept in solution or they are attached to a carrier formulation which will facilitate deposition at the required depth. Nanoparticles such as those consisting of polymers and siRNAs are formed in solution, but subsequent drying by either spray drying [107] or freeze drying [108] can produce particles retaining their silencing ability which in terms of storage and stability of a therapeutic agent might be preferable compared to a solution-based formulation.",

The level of uptake is thought to be low, although penetration enhancers may potentiate paracellular delivery. An important consideration is delivery and breakdown in the liver due to the first-pass effect commonly encountered by absorbed drugs. An alternative route through the gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) has been exploited for the delivery of micro and nanoparticles [119\u2013122]. The overlying follicle-associated epithelium (FAE) contains specialised cells termed M-cells [115] that are anatomically designed to sample luminal particles as part of the mucosal immune response. The lymphoid follicle domes are highly populated with macrophages, which have been shown to capture material. Systemic dissemination of these macrophages has been proposed as a mechanism of transport to peripheral tissue. Although particle transport through M-cells may be augmented by increasing particle-surface hydrophobicity or attachment of specific targeting ligands [123, 124], it is important to bear in mind when utilising this route for intestinal absorption that GALT only constitutes a small fraction of the GI tract, with the numbers deceasing with age. Recent attention has focused on transport across the epithelial barrier directly mediated by dendritic cells [125]. These phagocytic cells, widespread throughout the epithelia, have been shown to disrupt tight junction and sample luminal content through the projection of dendrites, providing an exciting opportunity for the design of oral vaccines.",

In this study, porous \u03b2-1, 3-d-glucan shells were loaded with siRNA targeting expression of tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1) or mitogen-activated protein kinase 4 (Map4k4) in mice. The internal element of the 2\u20134 \u03bcm particles contained a tRNA-core coated with consecutive layers of PEI and siRNA. Daily particle administration (\u223c0.4 \u03bcg siRNA/dose) by oral gavage over an 8-day period resulted in reduced mRNA levels of Map4k4 (\u223c60\u201370%) or TNF-\u03b1 (\u223c40\u201360%) in peritoneal exudate cells (PECs) compared to animals receiving scrambled-siRNA containing particles. Map4k4 downregulation elicited a concomitant reduction in TNF-\u03b1 expression that suggests a role for Map4k4-mediated control of TNF-\u03b1. In addition extended knockdown duration of \u223c8 days was observed after the final dose. Interestingly, the authors proposed that siRNA release from the glucan shell was triggered by the acidic environment in phagosomes; this, however, could compromise particle integrity at low pH within the GI tract. Notably, no unspecific interferon-\u03b3 response was detected even though non-modified siRNA was used. Map4k4 and TNF-\u03b1 silencing in macrophage-enriched cells isolated from spleen, liver and lung tissues was observed ascribed to particle uptake across GALT and subsequent dissemination in migrating macrophages. No direct evidence for M-cell uptake or adsorption levels was provided; however, this study does suggest the possibility for systemic silencing via the oral route.",

IBD encompass a group of complex autoimmune diseases, which are broadly categorised as Crohn\u2019s disease or ulcerative colitis found in the small intestine and colon respectively. An attractive pathological condition that could be exploited for improved siRNA-based therapeutic delivery is mucosa integrity loss in IBD. Despite the numerous targets investigated that includes IL-12, IL-23, IL-17 and IL6 [127], the current biologic treatment of IBD is based on anti-TNF-\u03b1 molecules [128]. TNF-\u03b1 has been the preferred target for oral-based siRNA therapies in two recent studies employing orally delivered siRNA for the prevention/treatment of dextran sodium sulphate (DSS)-induced ulcerative colitis in mice. In the first of these studies, Wilson et al. [89] used thioketal (poly-1, 4-phenyleneacetone dimethylene thioketal) nanoparticles (TKNs) designed for triggered anti-TNF-\u03b1 siRNA release in response to raised levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) common to inflamed regions. A tenfold specific decrease in colonic mRNA levels of TNF-\u03b1 and other proinflammatory cytokines (IFN-\u03b3, IL-6 and IL-1) was detected after oral administration of anti-TNF-\u03b1 TKNs (\u223c46 \u03bcg siRNA/dose) over 5 consecutive days during colitis induction. Furthermore, the authors also demonstrated by histological and weight analysis that a ten times lower siRNA dose (\u223c4.6 \u03bcg siRNA/dose) was sufficient to protect mice from DSS-induced colitis.",

            "text": "Mucosal delivery of RNAi therapeutics is an exciting approach that is set to progress rapidly building on encouraging clinical studies. The relative ease of access to surfaces common to pathogen, cancer and inflammatory disease promotes their use. Local delivery avoids the necessity to install \u201cstealth\u201d characteristics required for systemic delivery that reduces the complexity of design that has manufacturing, cost and clinical approval benefits. The restricted entry, however, encountered by macromolecules across mucosal barriers still requires delivery strategies to improve penetration. In this context, nanoparticles rather than naked forms seem the most promising. Research to identify surface characteristics that promote mucus penetration including hydrophilic coats is set to continue, whilst coatings that mimic pathogens evolved to penetrate the mucosa is an interesting approach. Detailed studies of nanoparticle penetration in mucus and changes in the mucus morphology in response to mucopenetrative materials are a future trend. Variations in mucus characteristics at different sites and disease states are an important consideration in the design of the delivery strategy. The polyplex systems composed of siRNA and cationic polymers such as chitosan could proceed rapidly into clinical trials due to their simplistic design and mucoadhesive and mucopermeable properties. A current trend is to identify new biopolymers to improve mucosal delivery and expand the selection of available materials.",

Anti-inflammatory effects in IBD preclinical models using particle formulations suggest that IBD will be a primary candidate for clinical translation. The development of bioresponsive particles or coatings composed of pH-sensitive materials, employed for other drug types, will offer the possibility for localised site-specific delivery utilising the differing pH found throughout the GI tract. The necessity for particle disassembly needed for siRNA incorporation into the cellular RNAi machinery calls for intracellular release mechanisms [131, 132]. Reducible disulphide links that are cleaved in the cytoplasm is a strategy, but cost may preclude clinical translation. In contrast to the necessity for stable particles in the circulatory environment, mucosal delivery allows the use of less stable systems that could facilitate siRNA release.",

Some of the initial siRNA-mediated antiviral effects were seemingly attributed to non-specific induction of innate immune responses due to Toll-like receptor (TLR) engagement. Proinflammatory responses are highly detrimental, particularly in inflammatory disorders. The endocytic pathway undertaken by particles can increase delivery into a TLR-rich environment that can inadvertently potentiate the response. Fortunately, these TLR-dependent (through TLR-3, -7 and -8 signalling) or independent (through RIG-1 and PKR activation) adverse side effects can be avoided by siRNA structure and sequence modification such as 2\u2032-O-methyl substitutions. Induction of non-specific immune responses is particularly pertinent in the mucosal immune system rich in immunocompetent sites evolved to recognise and protect against foreign luminal material. Evaluation of immune responses to both siRNA and carrier needs to be adequately addressed going forward.",
