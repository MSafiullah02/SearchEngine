Samples are sent to and tested in public health laboratories in each state by IFA and all positive, inconclusive, and 10% of negative samples are forwarded to one of three national reference laboratories where they are retested by PCR for respiratory viruses.14, 15 Between 2000 and 2010 the Brazilian surveillance system recorded 3,291,946 cases of ILI. Of these cases, 37,120 (1% of total ILI visits) had nasopharyngeal samples collected and tested for viral infections. A total of 16,962 (45.7%) tested samples were from patients over 15 years of age with 2604 (15.4%) positive for respiratory viruses. Overall FLUAV and HPIV-3 were the most common viruses detected. However, the detection rate of FLUAV declined from 41% to 18% during this period.15 In our study, HAdV, HBoV, and HRV were the most common viruses detected. FLUBV was detected in only 1.5% (2/134) of tested samples and FLUAV was not detected.",
