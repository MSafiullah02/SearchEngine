Bioethics is a subset of ethics that provides reasoned and defensible solutions that incorporate ethical principles for actual or anticipated moral dilemmas facing clinicians in medicine and biology. Unlike professional etiquette, which relates to standards governing the relationships and interactions between practitioners, bioethics deals with relationships between practitioners and patients, practitioners and society, and society and patients [1].",

            "text": "Modern bioethics has developed during the last four decades largely because the law has often remained silent, inconsistent, or morally wrong on matters vital to the biomedical community. The rapid increase in biotechnology, the failure of both the legal system and the legislatures to deal with new and pressing issues, and, in the United States, the increasing liability crisis have driven the medical community to seek answers to some of the difficult questions practitioners have had to work through on a daily basis [1]. The clinical application of bioethics relies on case-based (casuistic) reasoning, in general favoring patients' autonomy and values, but also considering other relevant bioethical principles, including those values inscribed in communal ethics and professional oaths and codes. It is incumbent upon emergency physicians, whenever possible, to determine not only each patient's individual values, but also whether the patient subscribes to an individualistic or a communitarian ethic. Such determinations may help decide who the most appropriate decision makers will be if the patient lacks the capacity to make his or her own decisions.",

For instance, the law operates under formal adversarial process rules, such as those in the courtroom, which allow little room for deviation, while bioethics consultations are flexible enough to conform to the needs of each institution and circumstance and, rather than being adversarial, are designed to assist all parties involved in the process. The law also has some unalterable directives, sometimes called \u201cblack-letter laws,\u201d that require specific actions. Bioethics, while based on principles, is designed to weigh every specific situation on its own merits. Perhaps the key difference between bioethics and the law is that bioethics relies heavily on the individual's values\u2014be they those of the patient or of the patient's surrogate. Also, even without the intervention of trained bioethicists, medical personnel can and should be able to make ethically sound decisions. The law does not consider individual values and generally requires lawyers for interpretation.",

On occasion, clarity within the law can lead to clearer thinking in bioethics (and vice versa). Both law and bioethics, for example, use the term rights, as in \u201cpatients' rights\u201d and \u201cthe right to die.\u201d This term, often used to advance an ethical argument about medical care, is frequently misunderstood or applied erroneously. Having a right implies that a person, group, or the state has a corresponding moral and legal duty. Without a duty to act, there can be no rights. The rights can either be positive, dictating that a person or group act in a specific manner, or negative, requiring that they refrain from acting. Legal requirements, other authorities, or individual conscience can bestow rights, an act that requires a corresponding duty by those with the power to act, such as health care providers [2]. This obligation to act can be based upon an individual's personal values, professional position, or other commitment [3]. For the physician, this duty to act is a role responsibility, at least when holding oneself out as a physician\u2014and possibly at all times. The role\u2013duty link occurs \u201cwhenever a person occupies a distinctive place or office in a social organization, to which specific duties are attached to provide for the welfare of others or to advance in some specific way the aims or purposes of the organization\u201d [4]. In this circumstance, performance is not predicated on a guarantee of compensation, but on a concern for another person's welfare [5]. The emergency physician has just such a duty.",

            "text": "Ethical traditions stretch back to earliest recorded history. Separate bodies of ethics, often encompassing a general system rather than a true theory, were developed in India and China, and within the Jewish, Christian, Islamic, and Buddhist religions. All these theories represent altruistic, rather than egoistic, attitudes toward mankind. Ethical theories represent the grand ideas on which guiding principles are based, attempting to be coherent and systematic, while striving to answer fundamental, practical questions: What ought I do? How ought I live? Ethicists normally appeal to these principles, rather than the underlying theory, when defending a particular action. Western bioethics continues to encompass a number of theories, some quite contradictory. Some of the most commonly cited include:Natural law. This system, often attributed to Aristotle, posits that man should live life according to an inherent human nature. It can be contrasted with man-made, or judicial, law. Yet, they are similar in that both may change over time, despite the frequent claim that natural law is immutable [7].Deontology. This theory holds that the most important aspects of our lives are governed by certain unbreakable moral rules. Deontologists hold that these rules may not be broken, even if breaking them may improve an outcome. In other words, they may do the \u201cright\u201d thing, even though the consequences of that action may not be \u201cgood.\u201d The famous philosopher, Immanuel Kant, is often identified with this theory. One example of a list of \u201cunbreakable\u201d rules is the Ten Commandments [8].Utilitarianism. One of the more functional and commonly used theories, utilitarianism, sometimes called consequentialism or teleology, promotes good or valued ends, rather than using the right means. This theory instructs adherents to work for those outcomes that will most advantage the majority of those affected in the most impartial way possible. Utilitarianism is often simplistically described as advocating methods to achieve the greatest good for the greatest number of people. It is often advocated as the basis for broad social policies [9].Virtue theory. This theory asks what a \u201cgood person\u201d would do in specific real-life situations. This recently revived theory stems from the character traits discussed by Aristotle, Plato, and Thomas Aquinas. They discuss such timeless and cross-cultural virtues as courage, temperance, wisdom, justice, faith, and charity. Recently, the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine took the unusual step of adopting a virtue-based code of conduct (\nBox 2) [10].Box 2Society for Academic Emergency Medicine Ethical Code: a code of conduct for academic emergency medicineAs a member of the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine (SAEM), I am committed to serve humanity. I will practice my art with conscience and virtue, keeping patient welfare my first consideration. I will be considerate, forthright, and just in all of my dealings with patients and colleagues, regardless of their power, position, or station in life. I will maintain the utmost respect for human dignity. I will strive to safeguard the public health and protect the vulnerable. I will advance the ideals of the profession, and I will not abuse the privilege of my knowledge or position. In addition to these general professional obligations,As a researcher of emergency medicine, I vow\u2022\nCompetence, conducting scientifically valid research that, before all else, benefits patients and society.\u2022\nCompassion, attending humanely to the comfort and dignity of all subjects, animal or human.\u2022\nRespect, securing the safety, privacy and personal welfare of human subjects, and offering informed choice whenever possible.\u2022\nImpartiality, treating fairly all those associated with the research process, including subjects and nonsubjects, coinvestigators, and potential authors, and being neither too eager to promote nor too quick to condemn new scientific concepts.\u2022\nIntegrity, reporting promptly any scientific fraud or misconduct, publishing only accurate, uninflated results, and resisting conflicts of interest and the lure of personal gain.\u2022\nResponsibility, advancing the boundaries of emergency medical science and taking care to use prudently the resources entrusted to me for this purpose.\nAs a teacher of emergency medicine, I vow\u2022\nAltruism, generously sharing the art and science of emergency medicine for the betterment of others and the honor of the calling.\u2022A commitment to excellence, maintaining my technical expertise and moral sensitivity through continued study and practice.\u2022\nRespect, giving all who seek to learn emergency medicine the dignity due a colleague.\u2022\nFairness, treating all students and fellow teachers equitably, in a manner free of prejudice, abuse, or coercion.\u2022\nHonesty, imparting truth and uncertainty openly, and identifying clearly for my patients all trainees and students involved in their care.\u2022\nMentorship, nurturing and encouraging the requisite technical, intellectual, and moral virtues of the profession in students of every kind through my words and deeds.\nBy keeping these promises, may I bring honor to myself and my profession, enriching the lives of patients, students, and colleagues.\nFrom Larkin GL, SAEM Ethics Committee. A code of conduct for academic emergency medicine. Acad Emerg Med 1999;6:45; with permission.Other theories. Other ethical theories are rarely applied within the scope of bioethics, and each has serious, if not fatal, flaws. Rights theory is based on respecting others' rights. The social contract tradition is based on the implicit agreement we make with others to exist in a cooperative society. Prima facie duties, although less rigid than deontology, lays down certain duties each person has toward others. Egoism advocates that each person live so as to further his or her own interests, a theory in direct opposition to altruism.\n",

The underlying question must be: \u201cWhat is the patient's desired outcome for medical care?\u201d Responses from patients represent concrete expressions of patient values. In patients too young or incompetent to express their values, it may be necessary for physicians to make general assumptions about what the normal person would want in a specific situation or to rely on surrogate decision-making. However, with patients who are able to communicate, care must be taken to discover what they hold as their own, uncoerced values. A typical, ethically dangerous scenario involves a patient who refuses lifesaving medical intervention \u201con religious grounds.\u201d Commonly, the spouse is at the bedside, does most of the talking, and may be influencing the patient's decisions.

The constraints generally require that there be the provision of timely and adequate medical care for the patient, which may be particularly difficult to achieve in emergency medicine. The most common conflict has been about whether to provide emergency contraception. Consensus generally discourages delaying necessary medical treatments, including emergency contraception, since patients often have no choice about the emergency department to which they go and cannot know the practitioners' attitudes about such treatment in advance [15], [16]. When conflicts over values exist, however, it is essential for the practitioner to recognize the patient's identity, dignity, and autonomy to avoid the error of blindly imposing one's own values on others.",

Second, they must become educators, teaching their lay patients enough about their diseases and treatments to make rational decisions. Finally, and most distressing to clinicians, is accepting that some patients will make what clinicians consider to be foolish choices. For physicians dedicated to preserving their patients' well being, allowing people to select what the physician considers poor treatment options (such as refusing treatment or opting for ineffective regimens) may be both frustrating and disheartening.

They are not laws, but standards by which a resident physician may determine the propriety of his conduct in his relationship with patients, with colleagues, with members of allied professions, and with the public.1.The principal objective of the medical profession is to render service to humanity with full respect to the dignity of man. Physicians should merit the confidence of patients entrusted to their care, rendering the full measure of service and devotion.2.Physicians should strive continually to improve medical knowledge and skill, and should make available to their patients and colleagues the benefits of their professional attainments.3.The medical profession should safeguard the public and itself against physicians deficient in moral character or professional competence. Physicians should observe all laws, uphold the dignity and honor of the profession, and accept its self-imposed disciplines. They should expose, without hesitation, illegal or unethical conduct of fellow members of the profession.4.A physician should not dispose of his services under terms and conditions that tend to interfere with or impair the free and complete exercise of his/her judgment and skill, or tend to cause a deterioration of the quality of medical care.5.A physician may not reveal the confidences entrusted to him in the course of medical attendance, or the deficiencies he may observe in the character of patients, unless he is required to do so by law or unless it becomes necessary to protect the welfare of the individual or of the community.6.The honored ideals of the medical profession imply that the responsibilities of the physician extend not only to the individual but also to the society where these responsibilities deserve his interest and participation in activities that have the purpose of improving both the health and well-being of the individual and the community.\n\nFrom Article VIII, Emergency Medicine Residents' Association Bylaws, Dallas, TX: EMRA, 2003; with permission.",

In other words, if there had been time in the past to think coolly about the issues, discuss them with colleagues, and develop some rough guidelines, can the rules worked out at that time be used in this case? If the current case fits under one of those guidelines that you have arrived at through critical reflection, and you do not have time to analyze the situation any further, then the most reasonable step would be to follow that rule.

The three tests, the Impartiality Test, the Universalizability Test, and the Interpersonal Justifiability Test, are drawn from three different philosophical theories.Impartiality Test. Would you be willing to have this action performed if you were in the patient's place? This is, in essence, a version of the Golden Rule and is intended to correct one obvious source of moral error\u2014partiality, or self-interested bias.Universalizability Test. Would you be comfortable if all clinicians with the same background and in the same circumstances act as you are proposing to do? This generalizes the action and asks whether developing a universal rule for the contemplated behavior is reasonable\u2014an application of Kant's categorical imperative. The usefulness of this test is that it can help eliminate not only bias and partiality, but also shortsightedness. Justifying one particular instance that falls under a rule is not sufficient for justifying the practice of acting on that rule.Interpersonal Justifiability Test. Using a theory of consensus values as a final screen for the proposed action, this test asks you to provide good reasons to justify your actions to others [43]. Will peers, superiors, or the public be satisfied with the answers? Also, can you give reasons that you would be willing to state publicly?\n",
