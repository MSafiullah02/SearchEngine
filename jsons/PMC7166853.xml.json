Streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus primarily causes equine infections. The agent may be found in the nasopharynx, on the tonsils, in the respiratory tract and on the genital mucous membranes of healthy horses and cattle. It is an important cause of respiratory tract infections in foals and young horses and it is involved in uterine infections in mares. The agent has also been associated with a wide variety of infections including mastitis in pigs, sheep, cows, goats and several other mammalian species [8]. These hosts can be a reservoir for human infections. The clinical manifestation includes pharyngitis, septicemia, meningitis, purulent arthritis and endocarditis. The source of human infection is often traced back to contact with domestic animals, especially horses, or ingestion of unpasteurized milk or milk products. Streptococci are colonizers of mucous membranes and are transmitted through droplets or direct contact.",

One outbreak occurred in the National Zoological Park, Washington D.C., leading to the death of several callithrichids after contact to infected horse meat fed to armadillos kept in the same exhibition area [4, 7]. Another outbreak of group C streptococcal infection with a high mortality rate occurred in a group of wanderoos (Macaca silenus) of the Zoological Garden of Rheine/Germany. The source was suspected to be a human being [1]. The Russian Primate Center in Sochi reported an outbreak of septicaemia caused by S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus in representatives of five species of lower monkeys [2]. In 1994, an outbreak among the pig and monkey population was reported from the island of Bali, Indonesia. The infection spread from pigs to monkeys and infected animals died within a few days with signs of bronchopneumonia, pleuritis, epicarditis, endocarditis and meningitis [6]. However, most of the reported disease outbreaks were characterized by symptoms of an enteric infection. The present case report describes an outbreak of respiratory diseases among rhesus monkeys induced by S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus.\n",
