Traditionally, PCR-based methods were complex and required extensive training in molecular biology, as well as ample time, laboratory space, and personnel for the running of assays. However, automated, nested, multiplex PCR (ANM-PCR) can now rapidly and thoroughly evaluate respiratory infections in living patients. This technology offers automated detection of multiple pathogens at once using nested PCRs which have increased sensitivity over traditional PCR (20) . ANM-PCR is technically streamlined so that minimal training and little hands-on time with samples is needed for successful analysis, thus making sophisticated molecular techniques more readily available to laboratories that do not have space and/or funding to run a full molecular laboratory. To our knowledge, no prior study has been conducted assessing an ANM-PCR respiratory pathogen panel on fresh postmortem samples. The potential benefits of such analysis include a greater breadth of pathogen detection with minimal labor and decreased turn-around time of results.

The decedents ranged from 2 weeks to 12 years of age. Cases were selected for PCR on the basis of the attending pathologists' suspicion that a respiratory illness may have contributed to death. Samples were acquired via postmortem mucosal swabs from nasal, nasopharyngeal, tracheal, and/or bronchial regions. Samples were then analyzed using an ANM-PCR panel of respiratory pathogens, specifically the BioFire FilmArray \u00e2 (20) (BioFire Diagnostics, Inc., Salt Lake City, UT). Briefly, each sample was acquired from a patient in the form of a mucosal swab, which was placed into BD Universal Viral Transport for Viruses, Chlamydiae, Mycoplasmas and Ureaplasmas (Becton, Dickinson and Company, Franklin Lakes, NJ). Specimens were transported in person to the microbiology laboratory within 2 h from the time of procurement. Upon receipt in the microbiology laboratory, hydration solution was injected into a compartmentalized pouch where the ANM-PCRs occur, the patient sample was mixed with denaturing buffer and added to the pouch, the pouch was then inserted into the analyzer, and the remaining reactions and analyses were performed by the bench top instrument. Two process controls were included in each pouch, an RNA process control and a PCR2 control. The RNA Process Control assay targets an RNA transcript from the yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. The yeast is present in the pouch in a freeze-dried form and becomes rehydrated when sample is loaded. The control material is carried through all stages of the test process, including lysis, nucleic acid purification, reverse transcription, first-stage PCR, dilution, second-stage PCR, and DNA melting. A positive control result indicates that all steps carried out in the FilmArray RP pouch were successful. The PCR2 Control assay detects a DNA target that is dried into wells of the array along with the corresponding primers. A positive result indicates that the second-stage PCR was successful. Both control assays must be positive for the test run to pass. When either control fails, the controls field of the test report will display \"Failed\" and all results will be listed as invalid.
