All birds in the negative control 247 group (NC) appeared clinically normal, while vNDv challenge resulted in depression, 248 swollen head, conjunctivitis, rales, sneezing and nasal discharge beginning at the 2 nd 249 day post challenge (PC) in all experimentally challenged groups (PC, VC, VTC, PRV 250and TTT). Greenish diarrhoea was also recorded in PC, VTC, and TTT(Fig. 2,", "latex": null, "type": "figure"}, "FIGREF3": {"text": "age of challenge (28 th d). Consistent with the reports of Sadeghi et al. (2012) 341 and Rahimi et al. (2011). In contrast, Barbour et al. (2014) and Thaje and Ulaiwi (2017) 342 showed that the addition of eucalyptus and mint oils improved the humoral immune 343 responses to ND virus in broilers. In addition, Wati et al. (2015) reported an 344 improvement in the humoral response (HI titre) to ND virus at 21 th d in broilers after 345 using a phytogenic product, but this effect did not last to 39 th d. 346 Though the obtained result for VTC [vaccinated, EOs treated (after each vaccine) 347 and challenged], an improvement of clinical protection (mortality, clinical signs, PM 348 lesions and viral shedding titre) was observed. This could be due to stimulating effect 349 on cell-mediated and local immunity (Cserep, 2008) and therefore eliminating some of 350 the viruses from tissues (Awaad et al., 2009). The penetration mechanism of the virus 351 into the cells determines whether the virus is affected by the EOs or not and where ND 352 virus penetrates cells through a fusion protein (Cermelli et al., 2008), which in turn can 353 be resistant to Eos (Barbour et al., 2010), so not all ND viruses are affected by Eos. 354 While, AI virus penetrates the cells through a receptor-mediated endocytosis 355 mechanism (Swayne and King, 2003). 356As many studies have discussed the In vitro antiviral activity of EOs against 357 avian viruses after contact between viruses and EOs for certain periods of time at room 358 temperature(Barbour et al., 2010), here we designed PRV and TTT to study the either before (PRV) or after vNDv challenge (TTT). The improvement of the clinical and pathological picture of vNDv was observed in PRV (received the EOs supplement 362 that was started from 1 day before the challenge and was continued for 5 days); in 363 addition, this group had the lowest oropharyngeal shedding titre (log 10 ), which could 364 be due to eucalyptus, as well it has been used in traditional medicine to treat respiratory 365tract infections (Cermelli et al., 2008) and may exhibit antiviral activity (Barbour et al., 366 2010) and thus affects the virulence of the challenge virus. Moreover, EOs showed 367 more protective level against vNDv challenge in PRV (preventive group) than TTT 368 (therapeutic group) that may be attributed to the effect of EOs mixture on ND virus 369 adsorption to cell surface and may block cell receptors resulting in interference with 370 virus binding; and its accurate mode of action should be studied through tissue culture. 371 Essential oils supplementation, during the period of 1 st to 28 th d, in VTC did not 372 significantly improve body weight gain compared to the other non-treated groups (NC 373 and VC). Although, VTC showed an improved FCR (1.77\u00b10.03), it did not 374 significantly differ from negative control birds (NC) (1.66\u00b10.04). Vaccination by 375 different live vaccines including ND, IB, and IBD viruses may be the reason for 376 significantly higher FCR in VC (1.89\u00b10.04). The same was observed during 7 days PC 377 for body weight gain and FCR. Nevertheless, the use of ND vaccines, regardless EOs 378 supplementation has improved (p>0.05) overall body weight gain in all challenged 379 groups compared to the positive control group. Similar results were obtained by Sedeik 380 et al. (2019). Supplementation of EOs as a preventive drug in PRV (that was started from 1 day before the challenge and continued for 5 days) along with vaccines 382 application has significantly improved the body weight gain compared to positive 383 control birds (PC). 384 The worst FCR was recorded in PC, followed by VC and TTT. In contrast, 385 El-Ghousein and Al-Beitawi (2009), Awaad et al. (2016), and Thaje and Ulaiwi (2017) 386 reported that essential oils of eucalyptus, mint and/or thyme oils resulted in significant 387 increase in the body weight and weight gain, in addition to improving the FCR.The EOs 388 enhance digestibility, balance the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) microflora and stimulate 389 the secretion of endogenous digestive enzymes, thus improve growth performance in 390 poultry (Williams and Losa, 2001; Cross et al., 2007). As well, thymol plus carvacrol 391 has reported to significantly improve body weight gain and FCR in broilers 392 (Hashemipour et al., 2013; Saki et al., 2014). The obtained results of body weight gain 393 and FCR in this study were similar to the findings of Rehman et al. (2013), Toghyani et 394 al. (2010) and Lee et al. (2003). The various results of the effect of different types of 395 EOs on bird performance in several studies could be related to variations of dose, active 396 components of the EOs mixture, the period of administration, and the environmental 397 and nutritional factors. 398 Lipid peroxidation is an autocatalytic process that leads to oxidative damage of 399 cellular membranes (Rhee et al., 1996) and cell death, producing toxic free radicals 400 including MDA which is used as an indicator of lipid peroxidation (Jensen et al., 1997), 401 while the antioxidative enzyme, SOD, protects cells from the damage caused by these of MDA in PRV and TTT at 35 th day although vNDv challenge didn't increase MDA 405 level in PC (positive control). These results make us ask about the role of ND infection 406 on lipid peroxidation and therefore the need for further studies. The decreased level of 407 MDA at 7 th d PC in VTC may be attributed to the antioxidant effect of thyme that is rich 408 in flavonoids (Cook and Samman, 1996). Furthermore, Youdim and Deans (2000), 409 Botsoglou et al. (2002) and Hashemipour et al. (2013) reported that thymol, carvacrol, 410 thyme oil, and/or oregano have strong antioxidant activity and can inhibit lipid 411 peroxidation. 412 Regarding the immune-stimulating effect of the EOs mixture for other vaccines, 413 AI and IB antibody titres were not affected by EOs supplementation, but that of IBD 414 virus significantly increased only at 28 th d. Similar results were obtained by Saki et al. 415 (2014) for AI and IB, but are not consistent for IBD, which could be due to the use of 416 thyme essence in the drinking water at different doses (0, 0.10, 0.15 and 0.20 mL/L) 417 from 8 to 42 days or the inclusion of different components. The haematological and 418 phagocytic activity assays were conducted only at 28 th day of age to detect the effect of 419 EOs on the immune response to vaccines (regardless of ND challenge). So the groups 420 were representing by NC: negative control, VC: vaccinated and non-treated with EOs, 421 and VTC: vaccinated and treated with EOs. One of the first lines of defence in the body 422 is leucocytes, which significantly increase in its number when the infection occurs (Ganong, 1999), like what was observed in this study in VC (vaccinated, non-treated). In addition to the lower H: L ratio in VTC (vaccinated and EOs treated), which may be 425 due to the positive influence of this mixture on reducing stress in broilers. It is known 426 that the H: L ratio is considered as an indicator of stress in poultry (Bedanova et al., 427 2007). Similar results were reported by Hashemipour et al. (2013). Additionally, 428 essential oils were able to increase the phagocytic activity (PA) and index in VTC 429 compared to VC. On the other hand, eucalyptus oil stimulates the immune response by 430 enhancing PA of monocytes (El-Ghousein and Al-Beitawi, 2009). Furthermore, 431 Acamovic and Brooker (2005) claimed that the polyphenol compound EO and thymol 432 have a stimulating effect on mononuclear phagocyte system and cellular immunity. 433 As reported in Table 4, lymphoid organ and liver index, red blood cell counts, 434 haemoglobin percentage, and haematocrit value were not affected by EOs 435 supplementation. Similar findings were reported by Hashemipour et al. (2013). 436 However, Al-Kassie (2009) showed that the supplementation of the oil extract of thyme 437 and cinnamon resulted in increasing red blood cell count, haematocrit, and 438 haemoglobin values compared to those of the control birds. 439 CONCLUSIONS 440 In conclusion, the EOs mixture used in the present study has a positive preventive effect 441 and some therapeutic effect on ND virus infection in chickens (in vivo) through the 442 decreased viral shedding titre, increased clinical protection, and decreased pathological 443 picture. EOs did not promote the bird's performance or the immune responses to the AI and IB vaccines; nevertheless it has an immune stimulating effect for the IBD virus. Further studies are required for determining their antiviral mode of action to help 446 control different field outbreaks and to decrease viral shedding in addition extended their appreciation to the Deanship of Scientific Research at King 450 Saud University for funding this work through College of Food and Agriculture 451 Sciences Research Center..
