Aminopeptidase N (CD13) has been implicated in most of these phenomena, although its participation has been attributed to its enzymatic activity, while its role as an adhesion molecule has been almost unexplored. Here, we show that certain anti-CD13 monoclonal antibodies induce HA of monocytic U-937 cells, independently of their effect on enzymatic activity. The phenomenon is related to binding to a specific site on the CD13 molecule and is independent of integrins. It is abrogated by low temperature, by the glycolysis inhibitor 2-deoxyglucose, and by inhibitors of tyrosine and mitogen-activated protein kinases. The inhibitor of microtubule polymerization colchicine has a synergistic effect on CD13-mediated aggregation, suggesting an inhibitory role of microtubules in this process. Finally, during HA, CD13 actively redistributes to the zones of cell-cell contact, as determined by live cell imaging studies, demonstrating a direct role of CD13 in the adhesion phenomenon. Together, these data show for the first time the participation of CD13 in monocytic cell adhesion. J. Leukoc. Biol. 79: 719 -730; 2006.",

[12] demonstrated that CD13 is distributed homogeneously on single malignant melanoma cells but relocates to the zones of cell-cell contact in homotypic cellular aggregates and to cell substrate adhesion sites, with filopodia showing a strong CD13 signal, suggesting a role for this molecule in cellular adhesion. It is surprising that although myeloid cells express the highest levels of CD13, a possible role for CD13 in monocytic intercellular interactions has been largely unexplored. In the promonocytic cell line U-937 and in primary human monocytes and macrophages, we have reported that CD13 accumulates in zones of the membrane presenting filopodia and redistributes to the zones of contact between monocytic cells and their phagocytic targets [13] . These phenomena could be associated with a role for CD13 or its possible ligands in adhesion-related functions in myeloid cells.",

For example, in immunobiology, cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions are crucial for antigen presentation, cytotoxicity, phagocytosis, leukocyte homing, and transendothelial migration [14, 15] . In tumor cell biology, during the postintravasation phases of tumor cells, HA has been proposed to play an important role in the establishment of metastasis by some types of tumors. For instance, Glinsky et al. [16] reported that heterotypic adhesion of breast and prostate metastatic cells to the endothelium and subsequent homotypic cell adhesion participate in hematogenous cancer metastasis. Finally, in angiogenesis, homotypic adhesion of endothelial cells is considered to be a crucial step in extension of new vessels [17] .",

As the size of the cell aggregates after 4 h of incubation made optical quantification impossible, images of each well were captured using a camera attached to a Zeiss Axiovert microscope, and quantification of cells in aggregates was performed using the colony-counting function of Quantity One software (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA). Data are presented as aggregation indexes (AI) \u03ed [number of cells detected by the software as blue colonies in each image (aggregated cells)/total number of cells detected\u03eb100].

Settings of the software were adjusted to detect as blue colonies all aggregates formed by more than three to four cells, which present optical densities (OD) high enough to avoid erroneous detection of two close cells as aggregates. Thus, AI obtained by quantification with the software are lower than, but comparable with, the percentage of aggregation obtained by visual counting. Both evaluations always correlated consistently.

To preclude the previously described functional cooperation between Fc receptors for IgG (Fc\u2425Rs) and CD13 [13] , we used F(ab)\u0408 2 fragments of the 452 antibody in all experiments. Initial experiments indicated that incubation of U-937 cells with intact anti-CD13 mAb 452 or its F(ab)\u0408 2 fragments induced HA (expressed as the percentage of aggregation\u03edthe number of cells in aggregates/total number of cells\u03eb100) in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 1A) . The percentage of cells in aggregates reached a plateau at antibody concentrations between 0.09 and 3 g/ml (Fig. 1A) and decreased with higher or lower concentrations. Aggregates were smaller in size at the lowest HA-inducing concentration of the 452 mAb (0.09 g/ml, Fig. 1A , open arrow). Therefore we chose the minimal dose required to induce aggregates of maximum size as our working antibody concentration throughout the study (3 g/ml, Fig. 1A , solid arrow). It is important that Fab fragments of the 452 antibody were not able to induce HA of U-937 cells, suggesting the necessity for CD13 cross-linking for the induction of aggregation (not shown).",

As optimal induction of HA occurs at subsaturating antibody concentrations, we measured activity at saturating and optimal HA doses. As previously reported for myeloid cell lines [24] , saturating concentrations of the WM-4.7 mAb had no effect on cell-surface CD13 enzymatic activity ( Fig. 3A , WM-4.7 s ), MY7 and 452 had a small but significant effect (MY7 s , 452 s ), and bestatin and WM-15 mAb (WM-15 s ) inhibited activity by \u03f350% (residual enzyme activity is a result of other peptidases on the cell surface) [24] . In contrast, at doses optimal for HA induction, none of the aggregationinducing mAb inhibited enzymatic activity (452 HA , MY7 HA , and WM-15 HA , Fig. 3A ). In addition, chemically blocking enzyme activity with inhibitory doses of bestatin neither induced aggregation nor affected HA induced by the 452 mAb (not shown). Furthermore, as shown later, EDTA, which is an irreversible inhibitor of APN enzymatic activity, had no effect on CD13-mediated HA either.

The binding sites of two of the three HA-inducing mAb are known: WM-15 binds to the zinc-binding domain of the enzyme, and MY7 binds to an epitope distinct but close to this domain [3, 23] . The binding epitope of the other HAinducing mAb, 452, is not known. WM-4.7 mAb, which is unable to induce HA, is known not to bind to the zinc-binding domain [23] . With these data in mind, we carried out competition assays by flow cytometry. Preincubation of U-937 cells with the 452 mAb efficiently blocked the subsequent binding of the MY7 mAb, suggesting that the epitopes recognized by both mAb are the same or close to one another (Fig. 3B ). In contrast, preincubation of cells with the 452 mAb did not interfere with binding of the WM-4.7 mAb (Fig. 3C) . Binding of the WM-15 mAb was not blocked by the 452 mAb (Fig. 3D ) or by the MY7 mAb (not shown). Thus, as the epitopes recognized by WM-15 and MY7 (and consequently, 452) mAb are known to be closely located [23] , these results suggest that the HA-inducing capacity of the three mAb depends on their binding to a specific site, which lies close to the enzymatic active site of CD13.",

On the contrary, as early as after 2 h of incubation, treatment with anti-CD29 mAb markedly increased CD13-induced aggregation up to an AI of 201.8% \u03ee 15.4 of that observed by anti-CD13 mAb alone (not shown). After 4 h, anti-CD13 aggregation in the presence of anti-CD29 mAb was 80.9% higher than that induced by the anti-CD13 mAb alone. However, after 24 h, cells aggregating in the presence anti-CD13 alone, reached the same levels of aggregation as those with the combination of anti-CD29 and anti-CD13 mAb (Fig. 5A) . After 48 h, the anti-CD13 mAb-induced aggregation begins to decrease (Fig. 5B) until it disappears at 72 h (Fig. 5C ). However, in the presence of the anti-CD29 mAb alone or in combination with the anti-CD13 mAb, cells remained aggregated at these incubation times (Fig. 5D) . The anti-CD29 mAb (clone 4B4), but not any other anti-integrin mAb used, was able to induce HA of U-937 cells on its own (see Fig. 6B ) with similar kinetics as those observed when coincubated with the anti-CD13 mAb (not shown), suggesting that this prolonged aggregation could be dependent on the CD29-induced HA rather than a synergistic effect between CD13 and CD29. Finally, the decrease in CD13-induced cellular aggregation after 48 h (Fig.  5B) was also prevented by anti-CD11a (Fig. 5E ) and anti-CD54 mAb (not shown), resulting in aggregates which persisted up to 96 h of incubation. These results suggest that although anti-CD13 mAb-induced aggregation appears to be independent of integrins, ligation of these molecules can increase it, apparently by stabilizing the cellular aggregates induced by anti-CD13.",

            "text": "As the results obtained with metabolic inhibitors suggested that CD13-mediated HA is an active and possibly signal transduction-dependent phenomenon, we tested several chemical inhibitors of intracellular kinases. It had been reported that CD13-induced signal transduction in monocytic cells involves tyrosine kinases (especially Src), phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI-3K) and mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK), extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2 and p38 [26] . Here, we tested the following inhibitors: herbimycin (Src kinases), genistein (tyrosine kinases), PD98059 [MAPK kinase (MEK)-1], LY294002 (PI-3K), SB203580 (p38), Ro-31-8220, and bisindolylmaleimide I [protein kinase C (PKC)]. Cells were preincubated for 2 h with a range of at least eight different concentrations of each inhibitor before the addition of the anti-CD13 mAb. AI was determined at 4 and 24 h at the concentrations of inhibitors at which cell viability was not affected. The whole range of concentrations was tested in at least three independent experiments, and representative results are shown in Figure 7A . The most prominent effect was obtained with herbimycin, which completely inhibited CD13mediated HA, suggesting that Src kinases are indispensable for the process. Inhibitors of PI-3K, MEK-1, and p38 also inhibited HA importantly (79.39\u03ee5.01%, 91.90\u03ee0.18%, and 68.5 \u03ee 7.2%, respectively). Genistein inhibited HA in 35.88% \u03ee 3.92, and the lowest inhibitory effect was obtained with the PKC inhibitors bisindolylmaleimide I and Ro-31-8220 (48.72% and 43.10%, respectively). These results support the involvement of MAPK in CD13-induced HA. As Grb2 is a common upstream adaptor protein involved in the ERK1/2 MAPK signaling pathway, we tested a possible physical association between CD13 and Grb2, which binds to phosphorylated tyrosine residues through its Src homology 2 domain. Sos is a guanosine 5\u0408-diphosphate-guanosine 5\u0408-triphosphate ex- change protein that binds Grb2 through proline-rich sequences, providing a link between Grb2 and MAPK, usually through the activation of Ras. As shown in Figure 7B , Grb2 and Sos coimmunoprecipitate with CD13 from lysates of resting and aggregated U-937 cells, further supporting the use of this signaling pathway by CD13 in monocytic cells. A lower amount of Grb2 and Sos was found to coprecipitate with CD13 from lysates of aggregated cells than from resting cells. The significance of the observed decrease in the association of Grb2 and Sos with CD13 after HA is, at present, unknown. As mentioned above, at high cellular densities, the aggregation and disaggregation phenomena occur faster. Thus, the observed decrease in the association of Grb2 and CD13 could probably be related to the disaggregation process. Figure 7C depicts a hypothetical signaling cascade, which may occur after CD13 cross-linking on the cell membrane according to the data presented here, which coincide with the previous report of Santos et al. [26] .",

As shown in Figure  8 and in the supplemental video created with the individual images of the time series, during HA, CD13 polarizes and accumulates at the zones of cell-cell contact, and the majority of the CD13 signal is localized in these zones once aggregation has been completed. As a control, in some experiments, a FITC-labeled anti-CD11a mAb was added along with the Texas-Red-labeled anti-CD13 mAb, and no change in the membrane distribution of CD11a was seen even after aggregation was complete (Fig. 8, last image) .

Most of the functions so far attributed to CD13 have been reported to depend on its enzymatic activity. Thus, the observed differences in the ability of anti-CD13 mAb to were preincubated for 2 h with the indicated inhibitor. Subsequently, the anti-CD13 mAb 452 was added, and the pictures were taken 4 h later. The control picture shows the aggregation obtained in the absence of inhibitors. In the graph, the percentage of the AI obtained with control cells (Control, solid bar) is represented for the indicated dose of each inhibitor (shaded bars, mean and standard deviation of at least two independent experiments). (B) HA was induced with the optimal dose of the 452 mAb using 8 \u03eb 10 6 cells/ml. Cells (20\u03eb10 6 ) were lysed after 60 min at 37\u00b0C. An identical amount of cells was incubated in parallel at the same conditions (cell density, temperature, time) but without anti-CD13 antibody (lanes labeled NA). CD13 was immunoprecipitated (IP) from lysates of NA and aggregated (HA) cells, as described in Materials and Methods. Ctrl lane corresponds to an immunoprecipitate from lysates of NA cells carried out with an irrelevant, isotype-matched antibody. An anti-CD13 immunoblot was performed using the same mAb 452 (top panel, CD13), and subsequently, the same membrane was blotted for Grb2 and Sos (middle and bottom panels). For the identification of the corresponding bands, total lysates of each sample were included. (C) A hypothetical signal transduction pathway, induced by CD13 cross-linking by mAb on the monocytic cell membrane, is depicted, according to our data about coimmunoprecipitation and kinase inhibitor's effect. P \u03ed Phosphotyrosine induce HA could be related to their distinct effect on APN activity. However, our results would argue that HA occurs independently of CD13 enzymatic activity for several reasons. First, the two anti-CD13 mAb with the highest capacity to induce aggregation (452 and MY7) have little effect on the enzymatic activity at saturating concentrations or most importantly, at optimal doses for induction of HA. Second, the high concentrations of the WM-15 mAb required to inhibit enzymatic activity do not induce HA. However, this mAb induces HA at lower concentrations, which have no effect on APN activity. Third, the aminopeptidase inhibitor bestatin neither induces aggregation nor blocks HA induced by the 452 mAb at doses at which it inhibits enzymatic activity in these cells. Finally, CD13-mediated HA is insensitive to EDTA, which is an irreversible inhibitor of zinc-dependent APN enzymatic activity [27, 28] . Therefore, CD13-induced monocytic aggregation appears to be independent of enzymatic activity. Similarly, CD13 enzymatic activity is not required for its role as a viral receptor [29, 30] , suggesting that this surface molecule may have an array of functions that are independent of its enzymatic activity.",

            "text": "As enzymatic activity did not appear to correlate with CD13induced HA, we hypothesized that differences in the capacity of the four mAb to induce HA could be related to their binding to specific epitopes on CD13. In support of this theory, competition experiments revealed that the 452 mAb binds to an epitope overlapping with that recognized by the MY7 mAb. Previous epitope mapping studies have shown that MY7 and WM-15 mAb bind to different but closely located epitopes, which lie near the enzymatic active site [23] , suggesting that binding to a specific site on CD13 close to the active center is necessary to induce aggregation. Accordingly, the WM-4.7 mAb, which is known to bind to an epitope distinct from the zinc-binding domain and different from that recognized by the HA-inducing mAb, does not induce HA. Furthermore, the MY7 and WM-15 mAb, but not the WM-4.7 mAb, block binding of the human coronavirus 229E to CD13 [3, 29, 30] , again supporting the conclusion that both mAb bind to closely spaced epitopes. It is interesting that it has been reported that binding of the anti-CD13 F23 mAb (which is blocked by the WM-15 mAb) induces a conformational change in the extracellular domain, resulting in the exposure of cryptic epitopes [31] . Therefore, it is possible that binding and cross-linking of CD13 by the aggregation-inducing mAb could trigger a proadhesive signal transduction cascade and a conformational change, which results in the exposure of a cryptic epitope responsible for binding or dissociation of an adhesion-related ligand.",

            "text": "As the majority of previous studies implicates integrins as critical mediators of HA, it was possible that one of the consequences of the CD13 cross-linking by mAb was the induction of the expression of integrins. Thus, we evaluated possible changes in integrin expression and possible crossinhibition of CD13-mediated HA by integrin-specific antibodies. As opposed to HA mediated by CD29 [14] , CD43 [19] , or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate [32] , CD13-mediated aggregation is independent of the integrins lymphocyte function-associated antigen-1/intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (CD11a-CD18/CD54) and CD29. The expression of these molecules was unchanged during CD13-induced aggregation, and the respective mAb did not have a significant inhibitory effect on it. On the contrary, antibodies directed against CD29, CD11a, and to a lesser extent CD54, appeared to stabilize cellular aggregates, as they remained intact for longer periods of time. We used an anti-CD29 mAb capable of inducing a HA response that lasted up to 96 h (not shown). This suggests that aggregation induced by the anti-CD29 mAb alone is more stable, and thus, in the presence of both mAb, the longer duration and the increase in CD13-induced aggregation may be the result of the sum of two independent phenomena. Con- in a glass-bottom culture dish in RPMI-1640 phenol red-free complete medium. Time-lapse imaging at 2-min intervals was performed in a Zeiss LSM 510 META confocal microscope equipped with a Zeiss heater temperature control system and including an objective heater (original magnification, \u03eb63). Images were analyzed and exported using the Zeiss LSM Image Browser 3.5.0.223. Numbers represent the incubation time in minutes. Time 0 corresponds to 10 min of incubation at 37\u00b0C with the mAb before the beginning of imaging. The cell indicated by the green asterisk relocates CD13 to the zone of its membrane, which is closer to the two surrounding cells; however, as soon as those cells begin to migrate away, polarization of CD13 is lost. The cell marked by the blue asterisk polarizes CD13 to the zone of its membrane, where it starts to approach the surrounding cells, that proximity is lost (4-min image), and the cell turns clockwise (10-min image) until it relocates the zone of polarized CD13 toward its new aggregation partners (28-min image). The cell marked by the white asterisk progressively moves from the center of the field toward the aggregate, showing increasing levels of CD13 polarization along the way. At 10 min of incubation, one cell approximates to its left, and it turns counter-clockwise, showing CD13 polarized to that side at 13 min. As this contact is not established, it turns clockwise again until it ends, establishing contact with the rest of the main aggregate at the right half of the field. The cell marked by the yellow asterisk is clearly not polarized at the beginning of incubation, but as soon as it makes contact with its aggregation partner, it starts turning counter-clockwise, until at the end of incubation, it shows CD13 completely polarized to the zone of cell-cell contact. Finally, the cell marked with the green asterisk polarizes CD13 during the period of time at which it is in close proximity with other cells. However, as the other cells move away, this cell loses its polarity and stays in the same place during all the incubation. This indicates that movement of cells does not occur at random. As a control, a FITC-labeled anti-CD11a was used during anti-CD13-induced HA, and no redistribution of CD11a was seen at any time of incubation (last image).",

To answer this question, we tested the effect of temperature, 2-D-glucose, and sodium azide on CD13 mAb-induced aggregation. Incubation of cells in the presence of optimal doses of the aggregation-inducing antibodies at 4\u00b0C completely abrogated aggregation. In addition, 2-D-glucose at the concentrations commonly used to block glycolysis had a clear, inhibitory effect on aggregation. These results suggested that CD13-mediated HA is an active and energy-and probably signal transductiondependent process. The MY7 and WM15 mAb had been shown to trigger signal transduction involving tyrosine and MAPK in U-937 cells [26] . Our results show that the 452 mAb is also able to trigger a signal transduction cascade, which most probably, is involved in HA. The data obtained with chemical inhibitors clearly implicate tyrosine kinase and MAPK pathways in the signaling cascade involved in HA. The involvement of tyrosine kinases in the process, demonstrated here by inhibition of the HA by herbimycin and by the partial inhibition by genistein, suggested that the Grb2/Sos/Ras/MAPK pathway was involved. Here, we show that the two upstream components of this signaling cascade, Grb2 and Sos, coprecipitate with CD13 in monocytic cells. We have found a constitutive association among these molecules, which persists during aggregation and decreases when cells start to disaggregate. The link between CD13 and Grb2 is still to be identified. As part of the population of CD13 resides in lipid rafts, and the adaptor linker for activation of T cells (LAT) is highly enriched in these domains in monocytic cells, the possibility of this protein being the bridge between CD13 and the MAPK pathway can be proposed. New experiments are necessary to test this hypothesis.",

An increase in AI was observed from the shorter incubation times (Fig. 6C) , and longer incubation produced an effect similar to that observed after coincubation with antiintegrin mAb, which is sustained aggregation at time-points in which cells incubated with anti-CD13 mAb alone had started to disaggregate. This result is in keeping with reported results indicating that colchicine and nocodazole (another regulator of microtubule dynamics) increase mobility and activation of integrins and that nocodazole alone induces aggregation of the macrophage cell line J774 [33] , although colchicine did not induce aggregation of U-937 cells in our hands. Although our current results strongly suggest that CD13-mediated aggregation is independent of integrins per se, the stabilization in the cellular aggregates at long periods of incubation observed by coincubation with anti-integrin antibodies could be similar and perhaps even related to the effect observed with colchicine. It is also tempting to propose that a distinct type of microtubuledependent mechanism operates during HA, for example, a similar release of CD13 from cytoskeletal constraints with a consequent increase in its mobility in the cell membrane. When comparing CD13-mediated aggregation with aggregation induced by other molecules in U-937 cells, it is interesting that the same doses of colchicine, which enhanced aggregation induced by CD13, block aggregation mediated by CD98 and CD29.",

Polarization of CD13 in the direction of migration implies its participation in the active cellular movement toward the zone of the culture dish where an aggregate is being organized, as well as in the establishment of the cell-cell interaction itself. The fact that CD13 is polarized only when cells are in close proximity further strengthens this conclusion. Also, CD11a, which stabilizes the CD13-induced cellular aggregates at long incubation times, does not redistribute to the zones of cell-cell contact, demonstrating that the CD13 redistribution observed is specific and not dependent on bivalent antibody-mediated cross-linking. Although our results demonstrate an important role for CD13 in cell adhesion, they do not necessarily imply that CD13 itself is the adhesion molecule.

Future work will focus in determining the molecular mechanisms directing this process and its possible physiological and physiopathological implications. For example, CD13 and several molecules known to mediate HA have been shown to participate in immune responses, as anti-CD13 mAb block dendritic cell (DC)-mediated T cell activation in vitro [34] . In light of our data, it is tempting to propose a role for CD13 in the stabilization of such cell-cell interactions. Under these circumstances, CD13 could act as a signal regulator [35] or costimulatory molecule, which by definition, decreases the threshold for activation of the immunoreceptor by stabilizing cell-cell contacts and/or increasing the presence of the receptor in signal-controlling membrane domains (i.e., lipid rafts), as we have proposed to occur during Fc\u2425R-mediated functions [13, 35] . In other cell types, HA also has an important role. Thus, in DC, HA has been shown to be a mechanism of intercellular communication involved in the interchange of maturation signals and in antigen transfer [36] . It is interesting that DC have been shown to express high levels of CD13, and CD13 participates in DC maturation [34, [37] [38] [39] . Thus, it could be interesting to determine the relationship between CD13-mediated HA and maturation. Another cell type in which HA plays key roles is neutrophils. In these cells, HA occurs upon activation and is of great relevance in many processes, such as acute inflammation and acute coronary syndromes [40, 41] . CD13",

Finally, because of the role of CD13 as a viral receptor [3, 4] , it would also be interesting to determine the implications of CD13mediated aggregation in viral infection-related cell fusion and syncitium formation. It is interesting that the mAb that induce HA are the ones reported to block viral infection [29, 30] , and the mAb that does not induce HA is known not to inhibit viral infection.In this light, elucidation of the role of CD13 in cell adhesion may contribute significantly to our understanding of the numerous critical processes where cell-cell interactions must be regulated precisely.",
