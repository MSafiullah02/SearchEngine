An agile, scalable and cost-effective testing, deployable at a global scale, can act as a game changer in this war. To address this challenge, building on the promising results of our prior work on cough-based diagnosis of a motley of respiratory diseases, we develop an Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based test for COVID-19 preliminary diagnosis. The test is deployable at scale through a mobile app named AI4COVID-19. The AI4COVID-19 app requires 2-second cough recordings of the subject. By analyzing the cough samples through an AI engine running in the cloud, the app returns a preliminary diagnosis within a minute. Unfortunately, cough is common symptom of over two dozen non-COVID-19 related medical conditions. This makes the COVID-19 diagnosis from cough alone an extremely challenging problem. We solve this problem by developing a novel multi-pronged mediator centered risk-averse AI architecture that minimizes misdiagnosis. At the time of writing, our AI engine can distinguish between COVID-19 patient coughs and several types of non-COVID-19 coughs with over 90% accuracy.",

Recent studies show that, it is virus shedding often through coughing by undiagnosed population that is contributing to much rapid and covert spread [3] . Data shows that 81% of COVID-19 carriers do not develop symptoms too severe to seek medical help and yet act as active spreaders [4] . Others develop symptoms severe enough to prompt medical intervention only after several days of being infected.

Such visit exposes more members of the public to COVID-19 while the patient is en route to the test facility. This is not a trivial problem given the recent studies that show how highly stable and hence contagious COVID-19 appears to be. For example, [5] shows that the aerosol stability of COVID-19 is up to three hours in aerosols and up to seven days on different surfaces. 4 ) Hospitals are already becoming over-crowded. Even if the test is eventually done, while waiting for the medical staff to take nasopharyngeal or oropharyngeal swab, the patient is likely to expose many in the waiting rooms to the virus. 5 ) Turnaround time for current tests is several days, recently stretching to 10 days in some countries as labs are becoming overwhelmed [6] , [7] . By the time a patient is diagnosed with current methods, the virus has already been passed to many. 6 ) Even with social distancing in place, the presence of untested carriers in the population exposes the first responders to the infection because of the nature of their job. For example, by the time of writing, hundreds of New York Police Department members have been tested positive and 3 have lost their lives [8] . 7) In person testing methods put the medical staff, particularly those with limited protection, at serious risk of infection. This fact is becoming clear from the alarming number of doctors and nurses being tested positive. For example, recent reports show that thousands of healthcare workers around the globe have been infected by COVID-19 [9] . This trend is seriously concerning because medics are the first line of defense in this war against pandemic. Their safety will ultimately ensure a nation's ability to safely navigate through this pandemic. Inability to protect our medics can lead to further shortage of medical care, and increased distress on the already stressed medical staff. This in turn will deteriorate the system's ability to provide care to those most in need.",

These distinct features can be extracted by appropriate signal processing and mathematical transformations of the cough sounds. The features can then be used to train a sophisticated AI engine for performing the preliminary diagnosis solely based on cough. Our in-depth analysis of the pathomorphological alternations caused by COVID-19 in the respiratory system (reported in Section II), shows that the alternations are distinct from those caused by other common non-COVID-19 respiratory diseases. This finding is corroborated by the meta-analysis of several independent recent studies (reported in Section II) that shows that COVID-19 infects the respiratory system in a unique way. Therefore, it is logical to hypothesize that cough caused by COVID-19 is also likely to have distinct latent features. These distinct latent features can be exploited to train a domain aware AI engine to differentiate COVID-19 caused cough from non-COVID-19 cough. Our experiments (Figure 1 , Section III-C) show that this is indeed possible.",

Droplets containing virus emitted through cough and landing on the surfaces where the virus has been shown to survive for long periods of time, have been reported to be the most prolific mechanism of spreading the COVID-19 [17] . Hence, if a COVID-19 patient is not showing cough as a symptom, that patient is most likely not spreading as actively as a coughing COVID-19 patient.

Our analysis shows that cough contains COVID-19 specific features even if it is non-spontaneous, i.e., when the COVID-19 patient is asked to cough.

Cough samples from COVID-19 patients include both spontaneous cough (symptomatic) and nonspontaneous (i.e., when the patient is asked to cough). This is to make the test applicable to those who may not be showing cough as a symptom yet but are already infected. We also gather cough samples from otherwise healthy individuals with no known medical condition, hereafter referred to as normal cough. The normal cough is included in the analysis to see if it can be differentiated from the simulated cough produced by the COVID-19 patients. Using these data, we test the hypothesis using a variety of data analysis and preprocessing tools. Multiple alternative analysis approaches show that COVID-19 associated cough does have unique features, at least when compared to pertussis, bronchitis, and the normal cough. 6) Building on the insights from domain knowledge and data, we develop an AI engine for preliminary diagnosis of COVID-19 from cough sounds. This engine runs on a cloud server with a front-end programmed as a simple userfriendly mobile app called AI4COVID-19. The app listens to cough when prompted, and then sends it to the AI engine wirelessly. The AI engine first runs a test to see if the recorded sound is a cough or not a cough. In case the sound is not a cough, it commands the app to indicate so. The cough detection part of the AI engine is designed to detect cough even in the presence of background noise. This is to make the app a useful screening tool even at public places such as airports and crowded shopping malls. If a cough is detected, it is passed on to the diagnosis part of the AI engine.

Instead it To this end, the medical researcher in our team began by analyzing in-depth the pathomorphological changes caused by COVID-19 in respiratory system by examining the data reported in numerous recent X-rays [13] , [18] - [20] and CTscans based studies [14] , [21] , [22] of COVID-19 patients. The goal here is to see if the pathomorphological alterations caused by COVID-19 are distinct from that of other common medical conditions, particularly the ones identified in Table 1 , that are well known to cause cough. If this turns out to be the case, then in cough caused by COVID-19 we should have latent features distinct from the cough caused by the other medical conditions. An appropriately designed AI should then be able to pick these cough feature idiosyncratic to COVID-19 infection and yield a reliable diagnosis, given enough labeled data. If no such differences exist at pathomorphological level, the idea of cough based COVID-19 diagnosis should be dropped. Because in that case, any AI based diagnosis yielded from cough is more likely to be frivolous correlation and not a meaningful causal relationship.

However, pneumonia can also be caused by many other factors including non-COVID-19 viral or bacterial infections. Therefore, the question arises: is there a difference between COVID-19 caused pneumonia and other types of pneumonia that can be expected to translate into a difference in associated cough's latent features? Researches show that compared to non-COVID-19 related pneumonia, COVID-19 related pneumonia on chest CT scan was more likely to have a peripheral distribution (80% vs. 57%), ground-glass opacity (91% vs. 68%), vascular thickening (59% vs. 22%), reverse halo sign (11% vs. 9%) and less likely to have a central+peripheral distribution (14% vs. 35%), air bronchogram (14% vs. 23%), pleural thickening (15% vs. 33%), pleural effusion (4% vs. 39%) and lymphadenopathy (2.7% vs. 10.2%) [25] .",

This further implies that COVID-19 affects the respiratory system in a fairly distinct way compared to other respiratory infections. Therefore, it is logical to hypothesize that the sound waves of cough produced by COVID-19 infected respiratory system is also likely to have unique latent features and the risk of these features overlapping with those associated with other respiratory infections is low. This hypothesis is supported not only by our own prior studies for diagnosing several common respiratory diseases using cough [15] , but also in a recent clinically validated and widely publicized study [26] . In [26] , a large team of researchers showed that cough alone can be used to diagnose asthma, pneumonia, bronchiolitis, croup, and lower respiratory tract infections with over 80% sensitivity and specificity. Another very recent study shows that cough can be used to successfully diagnose influenza [27] .",

The number of frames N can vary from sample to sample. There are several possible ways to use these extracted features for classification. In our approach, we extract two M \u00d7 1 MFCC based feature vectors for each input cough sample and concatenate them into a single final 2M \u00d7 1 feature vector for that sample. For the first feature vector, we take the mean of MFCC features corresponding to all the frames. For the second feature vector, we take the top few Principle Component Analysis (PCA) projections of the MFCC features across all the frames and combine them into a single M \u00d7 1 vector by taking their magnitude. Finally, we concatenate both feature vectors into a single 2M \u00d7 1 feature vector. This approach is further illustrated in Figure 5 in Section IV-C. Figure 1 illustrates the 2-D visualization of these features for the four classes through t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) with classification decision boundaries/contours. It can be seen from the figure that different cough types possess features distinct from each other, and the features for COVID-19 are different from other cough types, such as bronchitis and pertussis. Hence, this observation validates the practical viability of AI4COVID-19 based diagnosis encouraging us to proceed towards AIengine design for maximum accuracy and efficient implementation.",

In case, the sound is not detected to be cough, the server commands the app to prompt so. In case, the sound is detected to be a cough, the sound is forwarded to the three parallel, independent classifier systems: Deep Learning-based Multi Class classifier (DL-MC), Classical Machine Learning-based Multi Class classifier (CML-MC), Deep Learning-based Binary Class classifier (DL-BC). The results of the all three classifiers are then passed on to a mediator. The app reports a diagnosis only if all three independent classifiers return identical classification results. If the classifiers do not agree, the app returns 'test inconclusive'. This tri-pronged mediator centered novel architecture is designed to effectively minimize the probability of misdiagnosis. With this architecture, results show that AI4COVID-19 engine predicting 'COVID-19 likely' when the subject is not suffering from COVID-19 or vice-versa is extremely low, almost zero on the testing data available at the time of writing. This idea is inspired from the \"second opinion\" practice in health care. The added caution here is that three independent opinions (diagnosis) are solicited, each with veto power. How this novel architecture manages to reduce the overall misdiagnosis rate of the AI4COVID-19 despite the relatively higher misdiagnoses rate of individual classifiers is further explained in Section V-C through (9) and (10) .",

The approach we used to combat this issue is the clever mediator based architecture that practically eliminates misdiagnosis by declaring test to be inconclusive if the cough samples are even slightly confusing.

Motivated by the urgent need, this paper presents a ubiquitously deployable AI-based preliminary diagnosis tool for COVID-19 using cough sound via a mobile app. The core idea of the tool is inspired by our prior studies which show that cough can be used as a test medium for diagnosis of a variety of respiratory diseases using AI. To see if this idea is extendable to COVID-19, we perform in-depth differential analysis of the pathomorphological alternations caused by COVID-19 relative to other cough causing medical conditions. We note that the way COVID-19 affects the respiratory system is substantially unique and hence cough associated with it is likely to have unique latent features as well. We validate the idea further by the visualization of latent features in cough of COVID-19 patients and two common infections, pertussis and bronchitis as well as noninfectious coughs, all of which sound the same to a human ear. Building on the insights from the medical domain knowledge, we propose and develop a novel tri-pronged mediator centered AI-engine for cough based diagnosis for COVID-19, named AI4COVID-19. The results show that the AI4COVID-19 app is able to perform diagnosis of COVID-19 with negligible misdiagnosis probability, thanks to its novel risk-avert architecture.",
