In this regard, MOS field effect transistors or MOSFET2 is the main and basic component of most of the electronic systems nowadays. Among the numerous parameters of these systems, MOSFET gate length, which is a critical criterion of integrated circuits, will decrease to about 10 nm in 2016 [1\u20136]. The predicted process of decrement of the gate length by ITRS, has been shown in the Figs. 6.1 and 6.2. The reasons for the dimensions decrease are as follow: improvement of the part\u2019s quality and performance, improvement of reliability, decreasing the power loss, improving the output efficiency, and decreasing its price.\n\n",

In order to increase the speed, parasitic capacity and serial resistances must be minimized so that RC delay time decreases and the Clock Frequency increase. Increment of the contact resistance in electronic parts has been one of the main limitations of size decrement in the recent decades. Hence, using new materials in joints has been considered in order to fix the circuit quality and increase the speed. In order to do so, metal silicides have been used in the process of metallization of joints and local systems. Selection of metal silicides has of great importance due to these reasons: their low special resistance, their contact resistances are low against both kinds of silicon, their high thermal stability, and their processes are compatible with silicon standard technology.",

The studies of nano hybrid particles have provided important fundamental insights for new functional materials such as photonic catalyst, high performance electronic materials and so on. Therefore, a lot of studies have been carried out to prepare the organic/inorganic hybrid particles. The quantum size effect has been widely studied for the microelectronic devices because of their recent trend of downsizing. In addition, several reports demonstrated that the quantum size effect resulted in the new properties and/or the improved properties. In general, the quantum size effect is expected for the nano-particles below 50 nm in many cases. However, there are difficulties in manipulation and handling of such nano-particles, mainly due to the agglomeration and the adhesion. Therefore, good handling method should be developed for the nano-materials with quantum size effect in many fields, such as electronics and so on. From this point of view, Ohno et al. [15] were proposed the nano-coating of functional materials on the nano-particles. They successfully prepared the TiO2\u2013SiO2 hybrid particles by the modified sol\u2013gel process. However, the obtained hybrid particles were not core\u2013shell materials with homogeneous coating, and they couldn\u2019t control the quantum size effect. Therefore, they attempt to prepare the core\u2013shell TiO2\u2013SiO2 hybrid particles with homogeneous coating by LPD. LPD is well known as film deposition process, and some researchers applied the LPD method to prepare the TiO2-Polystyrene (PS) Latex hybrid particles.",

The coating layer thickness and the crystallite size were controlled by controlling the [Ti]/[Si]. In the case of the [Ti]/[Si] ratio of over 0.1, silica particles were completely coated by titania. The degree of the blue shift of the band gap energy by the quantum size effect for the obtained particles was approximately 0.13 eV larger than that of the pure titania, because of the existence of the Ti\u2013O\u2013Si bond. If the Ti\u2013O\u2013Si bond effect was removed, the blue shift of the band gap energy for core\u2013shell type TiO2\u2013SiO2 particles was nearly the same value as that of the reported values for the pure titania.

In Ti and Co mode, the first aniline typically forms in thermal range of 650\u2013700\u00b0C for C49\u2013TiSi2 and in 400\u2013600\u00b0C for Co2Si or CaSo in order to prevent the formation of silicide on SiO2 which causes a short circuit between the gate and source/drain electrodes.

The phase C54 is more sought to be used in these parts due to its lower special resistance and higher stability. The resistance of C49 has been reported between 60\u201380 \u03bc\u03a9cm and that of C54 between 15\u201320 \u03bc\u03a9cm. When the dimensions of the part decrease, the transition from C49 to C54 gets harder. The cause of this difficult transition is connected with low density of C54 nucleuses inside the C49 network. Since the transition of C49 phase to C54 is a process controlled by nuclear stage. On the Si lines, if the line thickness is less than the average distance between two nucleuses of C54, the formation of C54 phase will be dominated in single-manner development. This single-dimension development causes non-complete transformation of C49 to C54 and increases the resistance. Decreasing the dimensions of the part leads to the decrease of the temperature in which TiSi2 starts to form. One of the ways to prevent this is to develop C54\u2013TiSi2 in thin lines, and also making the Si amorphous with the signal ion. In another different approach, the application of slow-fusible like Nb, Mo, Ta, and W has been suggested to form C54\u2013TiSi2.",

Contact resistance of TiSi2 is high before 800\u00b0C, due to the presence of C49 crystal phase. Between 850\u00b0C and 950\u00b0C it decreases due to the formation of phase with formation of C54.

Nano-sized materials have been widely used to produce new semiconductor gas sensors, owing to the great surface activity provided by their enormous surface areas. Hence, they are expected to exhibit higher gas sensitivity. Being a promising gas sensing material, nano-sized \u03b1-Fe2O3 powders have been prepared by various methods, including chemical co-precipitation, sol\u2013gel process, metallo-organic deposition (MOD), and plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD). These methods are basically chemical processing techniques to build homogeneous structure on an extremely fine scale of a few nanometers from the molecular level. Tan et al. [38] used a different technique called the high-energy ball milling technique to obtain nano-sized \u03b1-Fe2O3-based powders as the sensing materials. In this technique, the decrease of the particle size into fine powders of a few nanometers arises from the high-energy impacts during the collisions. This method, which is also known as mechanical alloying, has recently been used to prepare nano-sized SnO2-(\u03b1-Fe2O3)-based powders with the grain size down to 8 nm for gas sensing. Such initially immiscible, mechanically alloyed SnO2-(\u03b1-Fe2O3) materials are far from their equilibrium state. It is suggested that the content of Sn4+ ions may play an important role in the gas sensitivity. However, the sensing mechanism in this SnO2-(\u03b1-Fe2O3) system has not been well understood because of the lack of a complete understanding of the microstructure of the materials.",

In particular, the sensor has shown good ethanol gas sensitivity values of as high as 845 at 1000 ppm in air. The sensor is selective to ethanol gas over carbon monoxide and hydrogen gases. The gas sensitivity is also found to be very stable. These excellent experimental results can be explained by the fact that such mechanical alloying materials have nano-sized particle grains and exhibit enormous oxygen dangling bonds at their particle surfaces. Figure 6.5 shows correlation between grain size and sensitivity for different milling times while Fig. 6.6 illustrates TEM micrograph for powders after different milling times.\n\n",

The concentric development of the particles, reminds us of dendrite development inside the pillar particles. By time, more NiSi aniline is transformed into NiSi2 and other NiSi2 particles develop in order to reach each other. These big particles seem to be composed of smaller pillar particles.

A large portion of Ni transfer is in the form of network penetration compared with penetration into the border of particles, and this can be due to the effects of swelling.

Some researchers have studied the effect of little (about 5%) in thermal stability of NiSi layer on the surface of Si(111) and Si(100). XPS8 and XRD9 together show the increase of thermal stability until the temperature 850\u00b0C. The constant negative section of NiSi for the second sample has of high stability to 850\u00b0C. Moreover, by increasing the temperature, the difference between bonding energy decreases, which shows that Pt has a constant distribution in NiSi structure.

On the other hand, Pt is not solved properly in NiSi2, so it creates a little change in G(NiSi2). Hence, we can ascribe NiSi2 nucleus thermal rise to the decrease of G(NiSi), and the rise of common line energy can be attributed to the trend to the formation of NiSi with high-pressure texture on the Si.

By decreasing the thickness, the resistance increase in joints. We also mentioned some specifications and capabilities in using TiSi2 (phase C54) and CoSi2. TiSi2 has two structural phases of C49 (high resistance) and phase C54 (low resistance). By decreasing the thickness of lines in joints; transition from high resistance phase to low resistance phase becomes more difficult. Therefore, using TiSi2 for dimensions lower than 200 nm faces the problem of resistance rise. CoSi2 as an alternative for TiSi2 has some basic problems despite the low resistance, including high consumption of silicon and high formation temperature (550\u00b0C). High consumption of silicon makes it more difficult to develop this layer in nanometer dimensions. Silicide Nickel (NiSi) with low special resistance, even in dimensions lower than 100 nm, and with less silicon consumption, lower formation temperature (350\u00b0C), etc. can be a good replacement for TiSi2 and CoSi2.",

For example, it has been shown that electrical conductivity, \u03c3, of ultrathin metal film decreases apparently with its decreasing thickness. Strong interaction between metal films and electromagnetic wave occurs when the film thickness decreases to nanometer scale. Meanwhile, electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) of overall quality of nanostructured materials, devices and systems becomes a more and more serious question with decreasing size and increasing working frequency of electronic systems.

The nano-structured ZnO thin films were grown on sapphire substrates using Laser-Molecular-Beam-Epitaxy (L-MBE). The thin film was consisted of regularly arrayed hexagonal nano-crystallite columns, whose facets form natural micro-cavities. These nano-crystallites confine the centre-of-mass motion of excitons. As a result of the quantum size effect, the oscillation strength of the excitons is largely enhanced, which is favored to the radiate recombination of exciton at room temperature. Excited using the frequency-tripled output of a YAG laser, the nano-structured ZnO thin film showed strong ultraviolet lasing at room temperature with a threshold as low as 24 kW/cm2. At a moderate pumping intensity, the room temperature stimulated emission is associated with an exciton-exciton collision process. At higher pumping density, the excitons are dissociated, and the ultraviolet stimulated emission is dominated by an electron\u2013hole plasma recombination process. Because of the large enhancement of oscillator strength of the excitons, the optical gain of the stimulated emission measured at room temperature reaches as high as 320 cm\u22121, which is an order higher than that observed in bulk ZnO crystals. In comparison with the electron\u2013hole plasma stimulated emission in most of commercial semiconductor lasers, the excitonic stimulated emission can be realized at relatively low external pumping density. The observation of excitonic lasing effect at room temperature might be valuable in realization of practical ultraviolet semiconductor laser devices.",
