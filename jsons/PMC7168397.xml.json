Vaccines can prevent EID outbreaks from becoming humanitarian crises (CEPI, 2016a; Kieny et al., 2016). However, market incentives have failed to sustain R&D efforts in this area (Plotkin, 2016). A new entity, the Coalition of Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), was set up in 2016 with a US$1 billion investment target to support the development of vaccines, contributing to the world's preparedness for EID outbreaks (CEPI, 2016a).",

By doing so, CEPI aimed to address the \u201cjust\u2010in\u2010case\u201d R&D preparedness gap associated with lack of Phase IIb/III\u2010ready EID vaccines in advance of epidemic outbreaks.",

Evidence suggests that the average probability of successfully advancing a vaccine candidate from preclinical through to end of Phase II is less than 10% (Pronker, Weenen, Commandeur, Claassen, & Osterhaus, 2013). In addition, the large costs (DiMasi, Grabowski, & Hansen, 2016; Gouglas et al., 2018) and long timelines (Russell & Gronwall, 2012) involved in developing vaccines make investment decisions in this space tremendously complex. This complexity is compounded by the fact that where commercial objectives are lacking, such as in the field of EID vaccines, commercial value alone is an insufficient criterion to making pharmaceutical R&D investment decisions (Antonijevic, 2015; Cioffe, 2011; Perez\u2010Escobedo, Azzaro\u2010Pantel, & Pibouleau, 2012; Phillips & Bana e Costa, 2007).",

The rationale was to invest in vaccine R&D projects that would improve the likelihood of generating vaccines relevant for use in response to these EIDs; as well as improve the likelihood that the platform technologies supporting these vaccines would be suitable for use in vaccine development against newly or unexpectedly emerging EIDs.",

First, pharmaceutical R&D portfolio management involves considering multiple criteria, including organizational capabilities, technical and manufacturing feasibility, development timelines and costs, and alignment with target product profiles (TPPs; Aurentz et al., 2011; Bode\u2010Greuel & Nickisch, 2008; Seget, 2005). For instance, the WHO has been advocating for use of ideal TPPs, or preferred product characteristics (PPCs) tailored to EID outbreak preparedness needs, to determine use potential of vaccines and to guide R&D priorities in the field (WHO, 2018).",

MCDA has become increasingly popular in health valuation (Marsh et al., 2017; Thokala et al., 2016) and its applications are numerous across a variety of areas in health (Adunlin, Diaby, & Xiao, 2015) and associated decision problems (Drake, de Hart, Monleon, Toro, & Valentim, 2017; Marsh et al., 2017; Thokala et al., 2016). MCDA can offer a rational and transparent approach to priority setting, simultaneously considering all relevant criteria to avoid ad hoc decisions (Baltussen & Niessen, 2006). Where there are multiple stakeholders with diverse perspectives, MCDA can make relevant conflicts explicit, helping decision makers understand them and consider their impact on decisions (Phillips & Bana e Costa, 2007; Timmis, Black, & Rappuoli, 2017).",

This framework places emphasis on different attributes of burden of disease, which are difficult to apply in the CEPI context, given the sporadic and unpredictable nature of EIDs. Moreover, it does not lend itself easily to the estimation of value of vaccine R&D, which is adjusted for the probability of success (PoS) of early stage, risky vaccine candidates; nor does it assume sources of preference and constraints that are relevant to the CEPI decision context.",

The 18 proposals had a combined budget of over US$700 million and were reviewed by CEPI between March and May 2018. Seventeen proposals were at the preclinical development phase and one proposal was at clinical phase 1, with the aim that CEPI funding would advance them to the end of clinical phase 2. Proposals covered three different types of diseases: Lassa, MERS, and Nipah. Proposal budgets ranged from US$22 million to US$68 million, with a median cost of US$35 million. Proposal timeframes through to end of clinical phase 2 ranged from 4 to 6 years, with a median timeframe of 5 years. Due to confidentiality restrictions, individual proposal budgets and timeframes are not reported here; however, it is these budgets and timeframes that have been used to generate values in the framework presented below. Proposal names and disease classifications have been anonymized throughout the remainder of this manuscript. Proposals have been labelled as P1 to P18 and platform types are labelled 1\u20133. Seven proposals covered disease 1; seven proposals covered disease 2; and four proposals covered disease 3.",

Specifically, for each criterion C1\u2013C5, and for each performance estimate (worst\u2010case, most likely, best\u2010case), the following steps were undertaken. First, the performance mean across all reviewers assessing a given proposal was calculated. Second, the difference between this mean and each reviewer's performance estimate on the given proposal was calculated. Third, steps 1 and 2 were repeated for all proposals. Fourth, for each reviewer, the average deviation of his or her performance estimate from the performance mean across all of his or her assessed proposals was estimated. Fifth, on the basis of Cicchetti's (1994) classification, reviewer variability was determined as good if this average deviated less than 20% from the performance mean, and excellent if it deviated less than 10% from the performance mean across all of his or her assessed proposals. Seven of the 44 reviewers were found to have at least one average worst\u2010case, most likely, or best\u2010case performance estimate against C1\u2013C5 that deviated more than 20% from the equivalent performance mean across all their assessed proposals.
