Detection of enteroviruses in water sources, or water-contaminated food, is a very valuable tool not only to prevent waterborne diseases but also to track down animal or human environmental viral pollution. Nowadays, molecular biology techniques allow the use of very sensitive and specific reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) procedures to detect enteroviruses. In this chapter, using bovine enterovirus as a model, we describe procedures for enterovirus detection. Detailed descriptions of proper sample collection, storage, and processing, including methods for water concentration and solid sample extraction to obtain viral RNA, are outlined. Next, we describe methods for enterovirus detection based on virus isolation in appropriate cell culture. Finally, protocols for molecular detection of enterovirus are described, including procedures for conventional, nested, and real-time RT-PCR.",

Samples should be taken from the affected individuals and their contacts (serum, swabs, spinal fluid, tissue, etc.) and from the environment (water, feces, food [especially seafood and fish], etc.). Implementation of systematic procedures and databases, including integration of sample labeling, registration of essential information (such as date and place of collection, nature of the sample, and any other relevant data), conservation, and storage are always critical points to track back every result obtained during the investigation (20). Samples should ideally be split into aliquots and immediately processed as soon as they are received at the laboratory, but adequate means for conservation and storage of samples should be available in case further analysis will be required. In this regard, it should be noted that enteric viruses are usually relatively stable and persist in normal environmental conditions for long periods; therefore, liquid samples are adequately stored at 4\u00b0C for several days and at -70\u00b0C for years, but freeze-thaw of samples should be avoided.

            "text": "Viruses are usually at low concentration in water samples; therefore, it is necessary to concentrate the samples for proper virus detection. Several concentration methods have been described in the literature aimed at this purpose. These methods are based on organic flocculation, filtration-elution, ultrafiltration, lyophilization, ultracentrifugation, and combinations of two or more of these systems (8,12,21-24). Among them, the filtration-elution method using electronegative (23) or, more commonly, electropositive filters has gained acceptance, the latter one being the most used either alone or combined with other methods (8,12) . As a consequence, the American Public Health Association has chosen it as the standard method for water-virus examination (24). Our experience is that this simple concentration method provides enough concentration power (up to 100 times) for most water samples tested but if further concentration is needed, an additional ultracentrifugation step may be used (see Subheading 3.2.1.2.). 3 This method assumes that the net electrostatic charge of most viruses at neutral pH is negative and thus, filters with positive charges in their surface can retain them. Viral particles are then eluted from the filters by simply changing pH conditions. Here we provide a simple protocol using membrane electropositive filters for volumes up to 5 L. For higher volumes, cartridges that filtrate up to 1000 L of water are also commercially available (CUNO). 1 . Before filtration, adjust pH of sample to 6.0 to 7.0. 2. Clarification: Environmental water samples contain variable amounts of materials in suspension; thus, to avoid filter clogging, a clarifying step is often required before filtration (see step 3). Coarse material might be decanted for at least 2 h at room temperature or, preferably, overnight at 4\u00b0C. If the decanted water still contains too many fine particles in suspension, it can be prefiltered through a Whatman filter paper, or further cleaned up by centrifugation at 9800g for 20 min in a Beckman (Avanti J25 I) centrifuge using a JA-14 rotor. This procedure yields a clarified supernatant already suitable for filtration. 3. Filtration: We use the filtration system outlined in Fig. 1 . Basically, a peristaltic pump drives the liquid sample through a prefilter and an electropositive filter (see Section 2) placed consecutively down the flow. Optimal flow rate is dependent on the size of the filter. For CUNO 47-mm filters, the maximum flow rate is 70 mL/min. 4. Elution: Once the sample has been filtered, the filter must be removed from its cassette and incubated for 5 to 10 min, with shaking, in 10 mL elution buffer (0.1 M glycine, pH 9.5, with 3% beef extract [see Notes 2 and 3]). 5. Neutralization: Because excessive exposure to alkaline pH may produce loss of virus viability, the pH of the eluate must be neutralized by the addition of 0.1 M HCl immediately after incubation (see Note 4). After neutralization, and before storage, we find that filter sterilization of eluates through 0.2-\u03bcm pore-diameter syringe filters is useful to have them ready for further analysis that require sterile conditions, such as virus isolation in cell culture.",

            "text": "RNA extracted from water concentrates, fecal extracts, sera, spinal fluid, supernatants of infection, and so on is assayed for the presence of enterovirus sequences by RT-PCR. Based on increasing sensitivity criteria, RT-PCR methods are classified as conventional, nested, and real-time modes. We find it convenient to use conventional RT-PCR methods when assaying samples with an expected high concentration of viral RNA, such as feces, gills, and supernatants of infection, whereas samples with an expected low viral RNA content, such as waters and water concentrates, require much more sensitive methods, such as nested or real-time RT-PCR. On the other hand, RT-PCR methods can be of wide or narrow range specificity, that is, respectively, those aimed at detecting \" as many enterovirus types as possible\"(generic methods) and those aimed at detecting a particular enterovirus species or strain (specific methods). The latter can be combined in the so-called multiplex methods to detect several different enterovirus species in a single determination (5,9) . Technically, the main difference between generic and specific methods relies on the relative evolutionary conservation of the target viral RNA sequence selected for amplification (http://www.iah.bbsrc.ac.uk/virus/Picornaviridae/). The 5\u2032-noncoding and polymerase regions of enterovirus genomes are highly conserved and thus are frequently chosen for generic methods (2,7,12,27) , whereas specific methods rely on a primer design targeted at sequences found only in a particular enterovirus type, and that do not cross-react with other types of enterovirus. For this purpose, appropriate sequences are often found in genomic regions containing the highest variability, such as the domains encoding for the structural proteins (10,11,14,17,27-31) . Primer design must thus take into account both the mode (conventional, nested, or real-time) and the range of specificity of the RT-PCR to be applied (30). Quantitative real-time RT-PCR (32) requires additional probe design, as those for the diverse available commercial devices (TaqMan, LightCycler, iCycler), but this issue is beyond the scope of this chapter.",

Later on, panels of antisera against different enteroviruses were made available to the scientific community to facilitate enterovirus identification (33). However, sometimes significant cross-reaction of serotype specific antibodies led to ambiguous serotyping (29). Nowadays, molecular techniques, particularly nucleotide sequence determination, are frequently applied for viral classification, so that under certain circumstances, molecular characterization is overtaking old serological procedures for enterovirus classification.",

Similarly, solid samples (food, feces) are better stored after the extraction step. In the case of seafood, filtering organs (gills) accumulate virus filtered from the water; thus, a minimal processing step consisting of dissection and separation of gills will facilitate their storage. 2. The volume of elution buffer necessary for an adequate virus recovery is determined by the surface of the filter. 3. To prevent microbial growth, it is convenient to filter-sterilize the elution buffer and store it at 4\u00b0C, being careful to open it under sterile (laminar flow hood) conditions. 4. Some viruses completely lose their viability upon alkaline treatment during filtration through electropositive filters. On the other hand, at high concentrations, beef extract is directly toxic for most cell cultures, thus being necessary to \" dilute the concentrates\"to avoid this effect (this drawback can be partially overcome by reducing the beef extract content of the elution buffer to 1%). Consequently, the filtrationelution method is less effective when virus infectivity is to be tested. However, detection of virus by molecular methods is not affected by these drawbacks. 5. For this purpose we use ultracentrifuge rotor SW28 (Beckman). The capacity of the tubes for this rotor is approximately 38 mL. For higher volumes of sample one should fill as many tubes as needed, whereas for volumes lower than 38 mL, one should dilute it with distilled water up to 38 mL, or, alternatively, use tubes and rotors suited for lower volumes, i.e., SW41 (12 mL). 6. Virus recovery is increased when, before resuspension, pellets are kept overnight at 4\u00b0C with a RNase-free water overlay. 7. The homogenization is more efficient after an overnight incubation at 4\u00b0C with extraction buffer. 8. One aliquot can be treated with chloroform, and another one can be filter-sterilized.",

The volume of the inoculum should ideally be high enough to overlay all the surface of the cell monolayer, but as low as possible to increase virus concentration to facilitate virus-cell contact. As a general rule, 15 to 20% of the volume of medium used for cell growth is adequate for inoculation. 11.

CELL LINES FOR ENTEROVIRUS ISOLATIONA wide variety of cell lines of different origin, available at the American Type Culture Collection, (ATCC, www.atcc.org), are commonly used for enterovirus isolation: HeLa, CaCo2, rhabdomyosarcoma, buffalo green monkey (BGM), baby hamster kidney (BHK), bovine epithelial cells (MDBK), porcine cell lines (IB-RS-2 [not available at ATCC] and PK15). In any case, it is usually better to use cell lines from the species where the virus was originally isolated.3.4.1.2. PROTOCOL FOR VIRUS ISOLATION 1. Inoculation: Carefully remove supernatant from semiconfluent (70-80%) cell monolayers in 25-cm 2 cell culture flasks (with screw cap) and overlay the cells with the inocula, consisting of a filter-sterilized virus suspension in physiologic media, i.e., neutral pH and isotonic salts (see Note 10). 2. Adsorption: Gently swing the flask to ensure spread of the inoculum over all the cell monolayer and close the cap of the flask. Incubate at 37\u00b0C in a CO 2 incubator for 30 to 60 min, swinging the flask gently every 10 to 15 min to prevent the monolayer from drying, as well as to allow interaction between remaining free virus and cells. 3. Incubation: Remove the remaining inocula and add fresh cell culture medium to the flasks (see Note 11). Incubate at 37\u00b0C in a CO 2 incubator and observe the cells daily for CPE (see Note12), under the microscope if needed. Usually, 2 to 3 d are enough to detect CPE, but sometimes incubation for up to 5 to 6 d is recommended to assess infectivity signs. To conclude absence of cytopathic effect due to virus infection in a given sample, at least three \" blind\"passages are required, that is, absence of CPE after three successive rounds of infection using the supernatant of the former round of infection to infect a new monolayer. 4. Virus recovery: Clarify the supernatant of infection by centrifugation at 1200g for 10 min to remove cell debris (see Note 13).",
