The World Health Organization (WHO) declared a phase 6 influenza pandemic on 11 June 2009 and declared it to be over on 10 August 2010 [1]. The first wave of the H1N1 2009 outbreak was notable for the number of fatal cases among young people and atypical risk factors for developing severe diseases. Since 19 April 2009, WHO had reported over 491,766 laboratory-confirmed cases of H1N1 2009 and 18,449 related deaths [1].",

We have reported previously the serious impact of the virus on the provision of critical care services in 2009 [3]. In order to rapidly inform health professionals in the Northern Hemisphere this study censored new incident cases before the end of the influenza season. In 2010, the deployment of vaccination and the acquisition of natural immunity against H1N1 2009 were expected to decrease the burden of disease due to influenza [4]. Australia and New Zealand were among the first countries to experience a second influenza season with H1N1 2009 following widespread deployment of vaccination.",

Comparing 2010 with 2009 there were no significant differences in the distribution of cases among different age groups. In both study periods the highest number of ICU admissions occurred among patients aged between 25 and 49. There was no difference in the proportion of patients with a body mass index greater than 35 kg/m2, who were pregnant or post-partum or who had no known predisposing factor between that observed in 2009 and 2010 (Table 2). The proportion of patients with asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, chronic heart failure, or an Acute Physiology Age Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) III or paediatric co-existing illness was lower in 2010, but these factors were still over-represented in comparison to the general population, as they were in 2009 [3] (Table 2). Furthermore, a similar spectrum of clinical illness was observed in 2010 as in 2009, with viral pneumonitis or the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) being the most common presentation. The severity of illness, as inferred from the proportion of patients treated with mechanical ventilation, renal replacement therapy and vasopressor medications, was not different between the two study periods. The durations of admission to ICU and to the hospital were 8.5 (IQR = 3.2 to 16.1) days in 2010 compared with 7.0 (IQR = 3.0 to 16.0) days in 2009 (P = 0.32), and 15.4 (IQR = 7.5 to 25.6) in 2010 compared with 16.6 (IQR = 7.0 to 31.0) in 2009 (P = 0.38), respectively. In addition, in 2010, 13% of patients died before hospital discharge. This proportion was not different to that observed in 2009, although follow up was more complete for patients in 2009, with 45 patients (15.9%) from 2010 still being in hospital at time of censoring compared with 63 patients (6.8%) in 2009.",

H1N1 2009 remained the dominant cause of ICU admissions due to confirmed influenza in both countries [3]. The second wave occurred later in the year but resulted in similar illness severity, affected similar groups at risk and caused similar in-hospital mortality. The incidence of H1N1 2009 influenza critical illness during 2010 was higher in NZ than in Australia, which was a reversal of the pattern in 2009. However, the combined incidence over both winters was similar in both countries. We observed vaccination failure in a substantial proportion of patients for whom vaccination status was known.

            "text": "The incidence of ICU admission per million inhabitants was higher in Australia than in New Zealand in 2009 (36.5 versus 28.3 admissions to ICU per million inhabitants) [3]. Conversely, in 2010 this incidence was higher in New Zealand. This difference is concordant with national data reporting 6,064 confirmed H1N1 cases in Australia (272 cases per million inhabitants) versus 1,810 in New Zealand (415 cases per million inhabitants in 2010) during the same period [2,24]. The proportion of confirmed cases hospitalised (727 of 1,810 = 40.1%) [25], and of hospitalised cases admitted to ICU (82 of 732 = 11.2%) in New Zealand was similar to 2009 [26]. Accordingly, the higher ICU admission rate per population observed in 2010 was due to a higher incidence of community infection, rather than a difference in severity of disease. The reason for the difference in infection rate between Australia and New Zealand in 2010 is unclear, as a similar proportion of the population was seropositive after the 2009 pandemic wave in Australia (22% (95% CI 19.1 to 24.9)) compared to New Zealand (26.7% (95% CI 22.6 to 29.4)) [27,28] and a similar proportion were vaccinated (21.8% versus 24.1%, respectively) during the inter-wave period. Possible explanations include natural variations in community spread of influenza or an effect of the difference in vaccination deployment where Australia used both early monovalent and later polyvalent vaccines while New Zealand relied predominantly on delivery of the polyvalent vaccine alone, although overall coverage was similar.",

Among the patients with confirmed influenza A, there were 29 in whom the influenza was not sub-typed in 2010 and 132 in 2009. Thresholds for undertaking testing both in hospital and in the community were not standardised. It is not possible to reach a conclusion regarding the efficacy of vaccination as the vaccination status of many patients was unknown. Finally, while we report a similar severity of the illness to 2009, we do not have information about anti-viral treatment, potential viral mutation and resistance to anti-viral drugs. Finally, we did not evaluate the role played by a corticosteroid therapy on the outcome of patients with ARDS, and we were not able to cope with the controversy about the effect of this treatment [30].",
