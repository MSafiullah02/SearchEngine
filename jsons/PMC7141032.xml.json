These symptoms are not specific to sinusitis.69 The most specific symptom in sinusitis is maxillary toothache, but this symptom is limited to 11% of patients with sinusitis.68 In a study by Williams and Simel,68 findings of purulent or colored nasal discharge, maxillary toothache, poor response to nasal decongestants, and abnormal transillumination were the best predictors of sinusitis. Physical examination usually reveals sinus mucosal edema, postnasal drainage, and sinus tenderness; however, none of these findings are specific to sinusitis.68 It is often difficult to distinguish viral upper respiratory tract infection and bacterial sinusitis in the first 7 to 10 days of symptomatic illness. Worsening of symptoms after 5 days, persistence of symptoms after 10 days, and severe initial presentation may be more suggestive of bacterial illness.56\n",

Disadvantages of sinus films include poor visualization of the ethmoid air spaces and the inability to differentiate tumor, polyps, and infection.56 Sinus CT scanning is the gold standard for radiographic imaging of the sinuses; however, these scans should not be used in the routine evaluation of acute sinusitis. Their main role is to help define the sinus anatomy before possible surgery.56 Definitive diagnosis of acute sinusitis by piercing the sinuses and culturing extracted material is impractical for office use.1\n",

Trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) can be used as first-line therapy for patients with PCN allergy. If the patient does not respond to first-line therapy in 2 to 3 days, the regimen should be changed to cover beta-lactamase\u2013producing H. influenzae or PCN-resistant streptococcus. The recommendations for second-line agents in acute sinusitis are amoxicillin-clavulanate, second- or third-generation cephalosporins (cefuroxime axetil, cefpodoxime proxetil, loracarbef), newer macrolides such as azithromycin and clarithromycin, and fluoroquinolones such as gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, and levofloxacin. Clindamycin also has activity against PCN-resistant S. pneumoniae. The duration of treatment for acute sinusitis is usually 10 to 14 days.32 These recommendations have been supported by two sets of guidelines for the management of sinus disease.1, 14 An additional set of guidelines recommended by the Sinus and Allergy Partnership advocates the use of amoxicillin/clavulanate, cefpodoxime praxetil, and cefuroxime axetil as initial agents and discourages the use of TMP-SMX.64\n",
