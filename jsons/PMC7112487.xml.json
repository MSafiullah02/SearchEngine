Many studies initially focused on isolated\nnetworks of fixed topology with mean-field approximation.1,2 The spread of sexually transmitted diseases and computer viruses\nwas studied based on scale-free networks.3\u20136 Several studies also revealed that epidemic processes in\nscale-free networks do not pose an epidemic threshold because of large connectivity\nfluctuations in infinite scale-free networks.7\u20139 Epidemic spreading was investigated in complex random networks\nwith degree correlations.10 Then,\nreaction-diffusion model in which the nodes contain agents11\u201314 was used in the process of spreading. The\nagents can move from a node to another, and spreading processes occurred within agents on\nthe same node. Further, the studies focus on the mobility of individuals.15,16 The movement of individuals among\ndense crowd in a city has a great effect on the epidemic threshold. A random diffusion model\nwas also used to investigate epidemic spreading among objective traveling people.17,18 The railway leads to a fast increase\nin the number of infected agents and a high final infection fraction. These models and\nresults are very useful for public health authorities to make effective decisions.",

            "text": "However, many spreading processes have been studied independently in a single network. In\nthe real-world, many spreading processes can occur through multiple routes simultaneously.\nFor example, sexually transmitted diseases can spread both in homosexual and heterosexual\nnetworks.19 Avian influenza, such as\n2009 H1N1 and 2013 H7N9, has recently made dead-end jumps from poultry to human.20 Thus, these viruses make challenges to\nhuman progress and survival. A natural extension is to use the interacting network model in\nwhich epidemic can spread from one network to another. Funk and Jansen21 used the bond percolation analysis of two competitive\nviruses in two-layer networks, and the effects of layer overlapping were investigated. A\nstudy on U.S. bisexual men showed that the bisexual men were the medium to connect the\npathogens from the network of heterosexual men with the network of homosexual men.22,23 Dickison et\nal.24 studied the\nsusceptible-infected-refractory (SIR) process and revealed that in strongly coupled\nnetworks, epidemics spread from one layer to the other at a critical infection strength\n\u03b2c, below which the disease does not spread.\nSaumell-Mendiola et al.25\nanalyzed an epidemic spreading process of two interacting networks. They also developed a\nheterogeneous mean-field approach and revealed that a global endemic state may arise in the\ncoupled system even though two networks are well below their respective epidemic thresholds.\nGranell et al.26 used a\nmicroscopic Markov chain approach to analyze the interrelation between two processes,\nnamely, the spreading of the epidemic and the spreading of information awareness to prevent\ninfection. They also determined that awareness spread leads to disease suppression. Zhao\net al.27 used bond\npercolation theory and the generating function with SIR model to calculate the epidemic\nthresholds of multiplex networks. Sahneh and Scoglio28 extended the single-virus spread model to the two exclusive\nviruses in two-layer networks, and they found analytical expressions that determine\nextinction, coexistence, and absolute dominance of the viruses. Zhao et\nal.29 promoted the concept of\nstate-dependent infected rate, and all the different influences between the two epidemics\nwere displayed. Therefore, epidemic spreading processes on top of multiplex networks reveal\na rich phase diagram of intertwined effects.",

In this study, a model composed of two interacting complex networks is\nproposed to describe the cooperative spreading processes. First, this model extends\nspreading process in a single network to cooperative spreading in the two-layer networks. It\ncan also be used to analyze unidirectional or bidirectional interaction between two-layer\nnetworks. Second, perturbation analysis theory is used to prove that epidemic thresholds of\ninteracting two-layer networks can be decreased in cooperative spreading processes. This\ntheory reveals that the cooperative interaction between two spread processes can promote\nspread. Epidemic onset arises in one network and that also arises simultaneously in the\nother network for the interacting networks. Thus, a global epidemic threshold for\ninteracting networks exists. Finally, this theory also displays that cooperative spreading\nprocesses in multiplex network enhance the final infection fraction.",

We focus in the discrete standard susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS)\nmodel1 for both networks with regard to\nthe spreading dynamics. In each subnetwork, the nodes are denoted as susceptible (S) or\ninfected (I), and the links represent the connection along which the infection can\npropagate. At each time step, susceptible (S) nodes may be infected from intra-layer\ninfected nodes and inter-layer infected nodes simultaneously. On the other hand, infected\nnodes recover spontaneously. After some transient time, the previous dynamics make the\nsystem into a stationary state. For interacting two-layer networks, let\n\u03b21(\u03b22) be the probability of\ninfection between nodes in network A(B) and\n\u03b31(\u03b32), the probability of\ninfection from a node in B(A) to a node in\nA(B),\n\u03bc1(\u03bc2) is the probability of\ncuring for network A(B). The prevalence of infection of\nA and B, defined as the fraction of infected nodes at a\ngiven time, is denoted by p1,i(t) and p2,i(t) for node\ni, respectively. So, the time evolution processes can be written as\np1,i(t+1)=(1\u2212p1,i(t))(1\u2212q1,i(t))+(1\u2212\u03bc1)p1,i(t)+\u03b31p2,i(t)(1\u2212p1,i(t)),p2,i(t+1)=(1\u2212p2,i(t))(1\u2212q2,i(t))+(1\u2212\u03bc2)p2,i(t)+\u03b32p1,i(t)(1\u2212p2,i(t)),(1)for i\u2208{1,...,N}, where q1,i(t) and q2,i(t) are the\nprobabilities of node i not being infected by any neighbor in\nA and B, respectively q1,i(t)=\u220fj=1N(1\u2212\u03b21aijp1,j(t)),q2,i(t)=\u220fj=1N(1\u2212\u03b22bijp2,j(t)).(2)In the first line in Eq.

Figs. 5\u20137 show that the expected infection ratios \u03c1=(\u03c11+\u03c12)/2 for multiplex networks as a\nfunction of parameters \u03b21 and \u03b22.\nThe white lines in the lower left corner are used to separate the epidemic survival region\nfrom epidemic die out region. \u03c1 = 0 in this lower left smaller region means\nthat the epidemic is eventually dying out. \u03c1>0 in the upper right region\nmeans that the epidemic is going to be eventually persistent in the population. Thus,\nhorizontal and vertical white lines represent the epidemic thresholds of complex network\nA and complex network B, respectively. Comparing the\nhorizontal and vertical white lines in Figs. 5\u20137,\nwe show that epidemic thresholds are decreased for cooperative multiplex networks using both\nfirst order approximation and second order approximation as compared to the epidemic\nthresholds of corresponding isolated networks. At the same time, Figs. 5 and 6 show that the die out regions\ndiffer trivially between first and second order approximation. Therefore, the simulation\nresults are consistent with that of the previous simulations.",

In particular, the epidemic thresholds of interacting two-layer\nnetworks can be decreased for cooperative spreading processes, thereby implying that\ncooperative spreading processes promote the spread of the disease. In theory, the global\nepidemic onset arises in the interacting networks simultaneously. Thus, a global epidemic\nthreshold can be used to uniform the two epidemic thresholds. This model can also be used\nfor unidirectional coupled networks. The results can provide hints for public health\nauthorities to make effective measures for disease control and prevention.",
