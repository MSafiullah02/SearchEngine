Rather than relying on plotting either the case number or incidence rate, this chapter proposes three temporal risk indices: the probability of case occurrence (how often did uneven cases occur), the duration of an epidemic (how long did cases persist), and the intensity of a transmission (were the case of chronological significance). By integrating the three indicators using the local indicator of spatial autocorrelation (LISA) statistic, this chapter intends to develop a novel approach for evaluating spatial-temporal relationships with different risk patterns in the 2002 dengue epidemic, the worst outbreak in the past sixty years. With this approach, not only are hypotheses generated through the mapping processes in furthering investigation, but also procedures provided to identify spatial health risk levels with temporal characteristics.",

            "text": "In 1854, John Snow curbed the spread of cholera by identifying through mapping the infected water pump located in the Golden Square of London (Snow 1936) . Ever since, mapping of infected cases has become an impor-tant means to generating hypotheses, guiding intervening measures, and controlling infectious outbreak. Mapping can help epidemiologists to find the origins of an outbreak, but more importantly, to target high-risk areas and places of strategic importance in disease prevention (Ali et al. 2003) . A Geographical Information Systems (GIS) is often constructed under these circumstances: a computer-based system is set up to integrate spatial statistics into maps, which can detect disease clustering and determine relationships between disease rates and relevant geographic locations (Lai et al. 2004 , Cockings et al. 2004 , Dunn et al. 2001 ). Recent studies have united temporal factors with spatial analysis and found dynamic epidemic changes in certain time course and in specific locations (Tran et al. 2004 , Harrington et al. 2005 , Morrison et al. 1998 , Jo\u00e3o et al. 2004 , Getis et al. 2003 . Unlike the traditional approach, this chapter enhances spatial analysis by using not only the incidence rate. We propose a spatial model that integrates temporally-defined epidemiological characteristics and verify it using data from the 2002 dengue epidemic in Taiwan.",

Few studies have focused on the interplay between the spatial clustering of dengue cases and entomological factors (Ali et al. 2003 , Tran et al. 2004 , Morrison et al. 1998) or environmental conditions (Alpana and Haja 2001) by using a GIS with spatial statistics. However, spatial analysis is the key to identifying the incidence of dengue fever (DF), dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS). On the contrary, several studies have the treated temporal issues on dengue transmission (Tran et al. 2004 , Harrington et al. 2005 , Morrison et al. 1998 , Derek et al. 2004 ). Innovative models of temporalspatial analysis in disease transmission have proffered, and tested by data of the 2002 dengue epidemic in Taiwan, which was the worst outbreak in both magnitude and severity in the past sixty years. Hopefully this novel approach of disease surveillance can be applied to detect other infectious diseases.",

Moreover, areas with moderate risks marked by circles (c) in Figures 4C  and 4D have higher temporal index values than their surroundings (Central Fig. 4 . Dengue significant risk maps of incidence and other three temporal indices to show spatial clusters and outliers. The Local Indicator of Spatial Autocorrelation (LISA) was adopted as the spatial risk index to identify both significant spatial clusters and outliers of the tested temporal in-dices. Monte Carlo significance test with p<0.05 was used to evaluate the statistical significance of spatial clusters and outliers. vs. Surroundings: =1.5~3.1 vs. 0.03~0.6 weeks, =1.04~2.01 vs. 0.01~0.57).

Although this chapter proposes three temporally-defined epidemiological characteristics (probability of occurrence, duration of epidemic, and intensity of transmission) to stratify the severity of an epidemic, it is difficult to compare these indices with each other in order of strength or severity measures. For example, which one of temporal risk patterns exhibited by, for example, a high intensity of transmission or a high duration of epidemic is more indicative? It is also apparent from the discussions above that none of the indices is able to stand alone. Clearly, further studies should focus on integrating three temporally-defined epidemiological indices into ONE single risk index. Furthermore, the effectiveness of this approach in identifying spatial-temporal epidemic risk patterns should be evaluated in depth by considering multiyear epidemic constructions, other diseases, and different locations.",

Rather than relying on mapping cases or incidence rate solo at different periods, this study enables public health experts additional options: (1) to comprehensively identify risk areas and examine their dynamic spatial-temporal changes throughout an epidemic, (2) to provide broader perspectives with temporal risk characteristics other than epidemic curves, and (3) to measure risk levels along with the sever-ity of epidemics after integrating spatial-temporal characteristics. Furthermore, monitoring spatial risk patterns over time described in this chapter can as well be applied to other infectious diseases, such as the West Nile encephalitis or Ebola hemorrhagic fever. Last but not least, the approach is potentially useful for controlling the fast spreading and highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAI) by shortening the duration of the virus activity, and by minimizing its intensive transmission in epidemic sites; thus avoiding a possible pandemic (Mermel 2005) .",
