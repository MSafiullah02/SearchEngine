Other demographic, epidemiological and clinical information were collected and inputted into a pre-designated electronic data collection form. All patients followed up to March 15, 2020.

The demographic, epidemiological and clinical information was shown in Table 1. All patients were tested for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid on sputum specimens from the lower respiratory tract at admission. As shown in Fig. 1a, severe patients had significantly lower Ct values than mild-moderate cases at admission (25 vs. 28, p = 0.017), suggesting a higher viral load in the lower respiratory tract. Furthermore, a higher viral load was observed in sputum specimens from patients who became severe during the hospitalization than those did not (24 vs. 29, p = 0.008). As shown in Fig. 1b, the Ct values of RT-PCR assays negatively correlated with the probability of progression to severe type in all the patients representing mild-to-moderate at admission.\n",

More importantly, patients with a higher baseline viral load are more likely to become severe. This finding apparently justifies the concept that early antiviral treatment, if effective, would reduce the risk of progression and thereby the mortality, which has been demonstrated in influenza [3]. In our study, sputum specimens were used, instead of nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs because it has been shown that samples from lower respiratory tract generally contain a higher level of viral load than nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs [4] and acquiring swabs is uncomfortable for patients.",
