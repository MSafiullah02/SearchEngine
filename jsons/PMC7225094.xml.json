Spreading worldwide in less than five months, the COVID-19 pandemic is a typical example of a global health issue [1]. In the months since the first COVID-19 case was reported in the United States on January 22, 2020, many studies have employed different models to reconstruct the epidemic (i.e., the spread of COVID-19 within the United States only) and forecast its future trends, from simple growth models to classic susceptible-infected-recovered models [2]. Yet due to the scarcity of available information about the early period of the COVID-19 epidemic, researchers lack sufficient data to construct complex and classic epidemiological models. In this context, the population-based ecological growth model is the preferable option for predicting the epidemic\u2019s future trajectory.",

To account for the upper limit of population growth, the 2-parameter logistic growth model was developed. In this model, the population growth rate is exponential in the beginning, but this growth rate gets smaller and smaller as population size approaches a maximum carrying capacity as detailed described in Richards [3], McIntosh [4], Renshaw [5], Kingsland [6], and Vandermeer [7].",

In all contexts, more extensive testing services detect more cases; when the initial time of an epidemic\u2019s outbreak is known, extensive testing can yield data that more accurately reflects the true growth of the epidemic. Data indicate that the incubation period of COVID-19 is about 14 days [10], and COVID-19 testing services in the U.S. became available in mid-March and were sustained thereafter following CDC guidelines. Therefore, the 14-day interval following the widespread implementation of testing should demonstrate the highest level of detection rates unaffected by the removal of infected individuals from the growth curve, presenting ideal data for model building. In principle, a model built with this data would more accurately capture and predict the growth of COVID-19 than models constructed from infection data ranging from the first detected case to the present.",

To our knowledge, we are the first to use this model to analyze the COVID-19 epidemic in the U.S. We also developed and used our model through an innovative approach. Namely, to fit the model we intentionally used data from a 2-week period when new cases could be more completely detected, and we then used this fitted model to reconstruct the growth of cases before and after the 2-week period as well as to forecast the future development of the epidemic beyond the study period.",

First, the exponential growth of our logistic model is very sensitive to differences in growth rate, and a small difference in the number of early cases can lead to a sizeable difference in predictions of subsequent cases. Second, although we strategically selected a 2-week interval of data that we believed would yield the best model for predicting the epidemic\u2019s growth, this data likely still underreported the actual number of COVID-19 infections, making our estimated growth rate smaller than the true growth rate. For example, the estimated exponential growth rate of COVID-19 is 17.12% for China [10], higher than 16.85%, the rate we estimated for the U.S. A small difference in the exponential growth rate can result in substantial differences in the maximum number of infections. And third, the data used for this analysis is from March 21 to April 4, 2020, where most of the reported cases are from the states of New York and New Jersey. The reported cases from these two states are flattened from reported CDC. Still, more cases are reported from other states, especially from the states of Michigan, Florida, Louisiana, which would add to the cases from New York and New Jersey to exceed the 800,000 predicted.",

In the absence of further policy action, we expect that more cases will be reported which may greatly surpass the estimated 800,000, and that the actual infection tipping point may occur later in April. Indeed, significant variations still persist in the estimated total infections in the U.S. even in light of available data: Ferguson et al. [13] predicted 2.2 million cases whereas the CDC\u2019s worst-case scenario model predicted a shocking 214 million cases [14]. At this moment, it remains unclear which estimates are more reliable.

The U.S.\u2019s daily exponential growth rate suggests that the number of COVID-19 infections will double every four days. For example, if the total cases are 500,000 today, there will be 1,000,000 in four days (with 40,000 anticipated deaths) if no timely anti-epidemic measures are implemented.

First, our strategic selection of data from a specific timeframe is more subjective than objective, and not applicable in all contexts. Researchers applying this method in different countries/regions with different anti-epidemic strategies implemented in different ways should make their own determinations regarding the optimal timeframe to select for their modeling. We selected the 2-week interval from March 21 to April 4 because this interval spans approximately one COVID-19 incubation period and because the U.S. government began implementing widespread testing services by the beginning of this period, meaning that data from this interval potentially captured a more representative set of new cases. Interested readers can conduct their own analyses using this model while expanding on this time window to further assess the utility of this method. So far, the model\u2019s short-term predicted daily cases are quite close to the observed daily cases, as shown by Table 2. However, our model\u2019s long-term predictions of future new daily cases may not be accurate (which is true of any model-based long-term prediction), so these long-term predictions should be considered with caution.",
