This nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) can be used by itself (Viread\u2122) or in combination with other antiretroviral agents (Truvada\u2122, Atripla\u2122). The highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) based on treatment using combinations of several antiretroviral drugs is now preferable and over the past decade it has led to significant declines in HIV-associated morbidity and mortality.5 In 2008, the same compound, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate was also approved for the treatment of hepatitis B as a drug operating on inhibitory effects towards HBV polymerase.6, 7 At present, tenofovir has become the most commercially successful drug for the treatment of HIV and HBV infections.",

This resistance has developed despite the number of available drugs on the market or the effective Global Strategy for HIV Drug Resistance Prevention worked out by WHO.10 In this work, we describe an optimized effective methodology for a large scale-preparation of (R)-PMPDAP, a promising future drug candidate for the treatment of HIV and/or other retroviral infections. Eventual clinical development of the compound can be supported also by our recent progress in the development of prodrugs. Preparation of prodrugs can improve bioavailability of the parent compound as well as pharmacological properties in general.",

The first method is the stepwise approach starting from the isobutyl ester of d-(\u2212)-lactic acid. It can be converted to the tetrahydropyranyl derivative, reduced to (R)-2-(2-tetrahydropyranyloxy)propanol and tosylated. Synthesis of (R)-PMPDAP is based on alkylation of 2,6-diaminopurine with thus obtained (R)-2-(2-tetrahydropyranyloxy)propyl tosylate followed by removal of 2-tetrahydropyranyl and etherification of the free hydroxy group with diisopropyl tosyloxymethanephosphonate.1a This process was also patented.1b However, the total yield of the key intermediate, 9-(R)-(2-hydroxypropyl)-2,6-diaminopurine, is only 38% and the introduction of a phosphonomethyl residue followed by deprotection of ester groups via transsilylation reaction with bromotrimethylsilane and hydrolysis proceeds in the total yield 47%. The second method is based on condensation of 2,6-diaminopurine with the appropriate chiral synthon, that is, (R)-2-[bis(2-propyl)phosphonomethoxy]propyl]-p-toluenesulfonate [\u2018(R)-PMP-synthon\u2019], the compound prepared from (R)-1-benzyloxy-2-propanol by a multi-step process involving chloromethylation, Arbuzov reaction with triisopropyl phosphite, catalytic hydrogenation and final tosylation.2 This method is appropriate for laboratory scale syntheses.",

This approach usually requires protection of amino groups. In our case, we selected a protection step with dimethylformamide dimethyl acetal. This reaction leads preferentially to mono-substituted product 11a (Scheme 3\n). Its further reaction with diisopropyl bromomethanephosphonate can be realized without necessity to isolate intermediates. This fact belongs to the main advantages of this process. Its particular disadvantages include complicated monitoring of the reaction course due to the presence of decomposition products originating from dimethylaminomethylene compounds and also a lower yield.",

            "text": "Similarly as all other ANPs, (R)-PMPDAP has a highly polar character due to the presence of a free phosphonic acid function and, hence, unfavorable pharmacological properties can be expected. A phosphonate group subjected to the physiological pH deprotonates and an ionized drug molecule is mostly impermeant to the cellular membrane unless pinocytosis is involved. In addition, a phosphonate based drug can be thus absorbed by gastrointestinal tract in a limited scope which disqualifies the drug for oral application. In order to achieve oral bioavailability and intracellular delivery of ANPs, their transformation to appropriate prodrug form is highly advisable.16 In our case, we decided to transform (R)-PMPDAP to two structurally different types of prodrugs: an alkoxyalkyl (hexadecyloxypropyl) monoester and an amidate prodrug. The first type was synthesized by reaction of tetrabutylammonium salt of (R)-PMPDAP and hexadecyloxypropyl bromide in DMF. The reaction afforded neutral diester 13, which was subsequently transformed in alkaline conditions to hexadecyloxypropyl monoester 14 (Scheme 4\n). The amidate prodrug 15 was prepared according to a procedure developed originally in our laboratory:17 an appropriate phosphonate ester (ethyl or diisopropyl) is treated with bromotrimethylsilane, followed by reaction with amino acid ester hydrochloride in a presence of triphenyl phosphine and bis(2-pyridinyl)-disulfide (Aldrithiol) under basic conditions (Scheme 5\n).",

After cooling to room temperature, the mixture was neutralized with acetic acid to pH 6, diluted with water and the product crystallized in refrigerator.

In a 96-well plate, a total of 5000 CrFK cells were pre-seeded and incubated for 24 h at 37 \u00b0C in a humid atmosphere containing 5% CO2. Subsequently, the cells were washed with 100 \u03bcl phosphate buffered saline (PBS) containing 50 \u03bcg/ml DEAE-dextran and inoculated with 100 CCID50 FIV in the presence of a serial dilution series of the test compound. Following 2 h of incubation, the supernatant was removed and the cells were washed with PBS. The infected cells were subsequently overlaid with 5% FCS containing DMEM to which a serial dilution series of the compounds was added. Infected cells without compounds were included as positive controls (virus controls) and uninfected cells were included as negative controls (cell controls). The plates were incubated for six days at which time viral supernatant was collected and analyzed by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for detection FIV p24 antigen. A total of 100 \u03bcl supernatant was incubated for 10 min in 0.1% TritonX100 and applied on a maxisorp plate (Nunc) that was pre-coated overnight with monoclonal anti-p24 antibody (11C7C7C1) and blocked with 5% FCS in PBS. Subsequently, the amount of FIV p24 was detected by a monoclonal biotinylated antibody (5E6D11) followed by a colorimetric reaction which is based on extravidin peroxidase (Sigma) and OPD substrate (Sigma). The absorbance was read at a wavelength of 492 nm (OD492). EC50-values were determined as the compound concentration that inhibited 50% of FIV p24 antigen detection as compared with virus controls. Cytotoxicity of the compounds was determined by incubating CrFK cells in the presence of a serial dilution series of the compounds at 37 \u00b0C and under humidified conditions. After 3 days of incubation the viability of the cells was measured using the CellTiter 96 Aqueous One Solution Assay (Promega) as per manufacturer\u2019s protocol.

Infected MT-4 cells were placed in a rotator within a humidified incubator for one hour to initiate and expedite the infection process. The cells were then diluted in assay medium and promptly added to 384 assay plates at a density of 2000 cells per well. The methodology and workflow for compound dilution and addition into 384 well assay plates was the same as used for the CC50 assay. Cytopathic effects of HIV infection show up as a compound dose dependent luminescent readout via a Cell Titer Glo assay (measures ATP/cell viability). Non compound treated (unprotected) cells die and exhibit a low luminescent readout. Cells in the presence of drug (5 \u03bcM AZT, positive control) are expected to be viable and relatively healthy after the 5-day incubation. A percent luminescent signal is calculated from a given well of a given compound dose based on the negative and positive treated controls.
