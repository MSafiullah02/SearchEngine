This virus has already infected hundreds of thousands of people and led to tens of thousands of deaths, with the numbers still rising quickly as of this writing, affecting essentially every country around the world. 1 Initial infections were discovered in December 2019 in the Hubei Province of China. Those infected presented with pneumonialike symptoms and abnormal lung computed tomography (CT) images. Samples from infected patients were screened by the use of a multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) panel of known pathogens. It yielded negative results. On January 10, 2020, the previously unknown pathogen was identified through nextgeneration sequencing as an RNA virus. 2 Its genome sequence showed that the novel virus was similar to SARS-CoV, the virus that caused severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2002\u2212 2003, and it was named SARS-CoV-2.",

The availability of a cost-effective, rapid point-of-care diagnostic test available to doctors in emergency rooms, clinics, and community hospitals is critical. These diagnostics enable frontline workers to triage patients simply and to prevent further spread of the virus. (b) Surveillance and monitoring. Diagnostics are critical in determining the spread of an infection. Mass surveillance with rapid diagnostics helps public health officials monitor virus spread, proactively identify areas with increasing infections, anticipate surge capacity needs, and deploy needed resources to the appropriate areas. The success of such a system hinges on clear and transparent collaboration and communications between federal and state/principal public health laboratories, hospitals, government agencies, and communities. The World Health Organization and others have argued that widespread testing will be needed to stop this pandemic. 6 (c) Therapeutics. Patients may need to be treated once individuals with COVID-19 are identified. These therapies block the replication of the virus in the host. Basic studies of the nano-bio interactions could be adapted to understand how SARS-CoV-2 infects their cells (e.g., SARS-CoV-2 is 60\u2212140 nm and binds to angiotensin converting enzyme receptor 2, ACE2), which can lead to new therapeutic agents and design. (d) Vaccine development. Vaccines are instrumental in preventing disease by boosting the immune system against a pathogen. One vaccine being evaluated is a messenger RNA (mRNA)\u2212lipid nanoparticle vaccine based on the previous studies of SARS-CoV and the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). 5 Life as we knew it before this pandemic has been forever altered. In the fight against COVID-19, research and technology development and deployment are our best weapons. Nanotechnology tools can be adapted to detect, to treat, and to prevent this disease. Our community has a chance to accelerate the translation of our developments and deploy nanotechnology advances as frontline tools. ACS Nano is here to help disseminate your contributions and strategies for fighting the COVID-19 pandemic. 3, 7 We hope that you and yours are safe and well.",
