Lessons learned from SARS resulted in positive changes at provincial and federal levels of government in preparing for future outbreaks of disease and pandemics, not least of which was a better funded, more integrated, and more responsive public health system (Tam, 2018). As a result, following the outbreak of COVID-19, Canada was more prepared than some other countries to prevent the spread of the virus. Nevertheless, the ease of transmission of the COVID-19 virus and its potential to kill healthy people (Verity et al., 2020) have led to significant changes within Canadian society that have affected the delivery of mental health care and have the potential to affect the mental health of Canadians, including its senior citizens.",

This policy has resulted in a number of changes to the delivery of mental health care. Most outpatient care is now delivered virtually, either by video or telephone. Based on anecdotal experience, there has been a fairly seamless transition in the provision of care for persons who live at home, particularly since Medicare fees were adjusted to compensate physicians for provision of telephone care, which is not typically reimbursed.",

            "text": "Canada has been successful thus far in limiting the burden of COVID-19 on its hospital system. However, this positive news belies a crisis in the LTC system, where hundreds of facilities across Canada have experienced outbreaks of infection (Hsu and Lane, 2020). This has made it challenging to provide mental health care to residents of LTCH, where psychogeriatric staff would previously visit the homes to provide care. Among the challenges are the limited availability of portable telemedicine technology in some LTCH and the difficulty in providing virtual care to residents who are in isolation because of infection. Moreover, social distancing practices in LTCH (including a prohibition on all but essential visitors) now place even more demands on the time of busy frontline staff, who may therefore be less available to participate in the process of providing psychogeriatric assessment and care. Finally, given the disproportionate incidence of COVID-19 infections in LTCH, frontline staff are at higher risk of being infected with the virus, resulting in increased psychological distress among staff, as well as staff shortages due to sickness and absenteeism. Staff shortages may be further exacerbated by the recent decision by some provincial governments to stop LTC staff from working at multiple facilities in an effort to prevent the spread of the virus (Van Evra, 2020).",

As noted, the publically funded and universally accessible health care system and telemedicine services have allowed continuity of most outpatient care for those individuals already receiving mental health care, notwithstanding the disruption to services provided to LTCH. However, it is probable that social distancing will lead to less frequent contact by older adults with their family physicians, who are the frontline for treating mental health problems in Canada and the gatekeepers for most outpatient psychiatric referrals. As a result, more incident cases of mental disorder may go undetected and untreated. Social distancing may also lead to an increased sense of isolation and loneliness, which are risk factors for the development of depression and cognitive impairment (Choi et al., 2015; Read, 2020).",

Access to pharmacies has been unhindered, with many pharmacies expanding their home delivery service. Pharmacies have been restricting quantities of drugs to one month at a time, in an attempt to forestall drug shortages, should there be production issues in the future. Mental health and caregiver organizations have expanded their online presence, with information about the potential effect of the pandemic and related public health measures on mental health, as well as strategies for coping, including links to web-based counseling and advice on how to make the best use of technology.

LTCH are typically understaffed (Hsu and Lane, 2020), and many staff do not have the knowledge and skills to adequately manage psychiatric symptoms and problematic behaviors. In addition, some facilities have limited access to smoking areas, which creates a challenge in managing residents with chronic mental health conditions and nicotine dependence. LTCH rely on the resources and expertise of psychogeriatric outreach teams to provide guidance in managing residents with dementia, as well as older individuals with serious and persistent mental illness. In lieu of providing on-site support during the COVID-19 outbreak, psychogeriatric teams are exploring ways to provide impactful digital support. For example, digital access to behavioral support specialists who are on call and can provide rapid consultation is one potential model. Tablets could be used by LTCH staff, as well as by family members, to observe, support, and interact with residents who are in physical isolation because of infection, although the current challenges are availability of devices and uneven wi-fi connection.",
