Generally, these models aim at retaining the degree distribution observed in real-world networks. In this work, we explore whether existing network growth models can realize the diversity in citation growth exhibited by individual papers -a new node-centric property observed recently in citation networks across multiple domains of research. We theoretically and empirically show that the network growth models which are solely based on degree and/or intrinsic fitness cannot realize certain temporal growth behaviors that are observed in real-world citation networks. To this end, we propose two new growth models that localize the influence of papers through an appropriate attachment mechanism. Experimental results on the real-world citation networks of Computer Science and Physics domains show that our proposed models can better explain the temporal behavior of citation networks than existing models.",

Citation network is one such example of a complex network, which captures citation relationships between paper sources or documents. A citation network is a directed and acyclic information network, with the documents being the nodes, and directed edges representing citations of one document by another, thereby capturing the flow of information or knowledge in a particular field. An important property of citation networks is the \"in-degree distribution\" of nodes. Several models have been proposed to illustrate this distribution [15] -but while these models aim at retaining the power-law degree distribution in synthetic networks, they fail to reproduce other important properties that real-world citation networks might possess. For instance, Ren et al. [16] pointed out that existing models underestimate the number of triangles and thus fail to model the high clustering in citation networks, which is closely related to network transitivity and the formation of communities. In a series of papers [5, 6] , Chakraborty et al. showed that the temporal growth of the in-degree of nodes (aka, citation trajectory) in citation networks can be grouped into five major patterns, and such patterns are prevalent across citation networks of different domains, e.g., Computer Science, Physics.",

This immediately calls for the need to investigate more involved growth models. We address this issue by accounting for local and global influences exerted by individual nodes in a network. We introduce the concept of a 'location space' associated with the nodes in the network [3] , and propose two new preferential-attachment growth models based on this concept -Location-Based Model (LBM) and Location-Based Model with Gaussian active subspaces (LBM-G). LBM models both the local and global influences, with new nodes connecting preferentially based on the combined influence. LBM-G is an extension of LBM, which models regions of high activity that can be shifted periodically. We evaluate the proposed models on both the Computer Science and Physics citation networks. Experimental results show that LBM and LBM-G are indeed more accurate at realizing the citation trajectories of nodes compared to other network models. 1",

We observe that this proportion generally peaks for moderate values of S and \u03c3. Table 5 .

This is important because edge formation in real networks is usually a local process. Experimental results showed significant improvement over the existing growth models on two real-world datasets in terms of realizing different citation trajectories of papers.",
