Although one swallow doesn't make a summer this case report is in keeping with online accounts, mainly on social media, of other patients receiving immunosuppressive MS therapies who have experienced uncomplicated COVID-19.

This is not unexpected as the severe pulmonary complications of COVID-19 infection are consistent with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which appears to be immune-mediated (Ramanathan et al., 2020) . At present numerous exploratory trials of several immunosuppressive therapies are underway in COVID-19. These include fingolimod (NCT04280588) an S1P modulator, tocilizumab (NCT04331795) an anti-IL6-receptor antagonist, anakinra (NCT04341584) an IL1 receptor antagonist and emapalumab (NCT04324021) an anti-interferon-gamma monoclonal antibody.

The proportion of immunocompromised patients in the COVID-19 cohort was 3.7x lower than that in the viral pneumonia cohort (2.3% vs. 8.5%, p<0.00001; Figure 1 ) (Icnarc Website, 2020).

This may explain why patients on anti-CD20 therapies cope relatively well with viral infections. Ocrelizumab and other anti-CD20 therapies have a relatively minor impact on T-cell counts and have not been associated with severe viral infections (Mayer et al., 2019) . In the MS registration trials of ocrelizumab, infections were slightly more frequent on ocrelizumab compared to comparator arms (interferon-beta-1a or placebo) (Hauser et al., 2017; Montalban et al., 2017) . The identifiable viral infection in these trials was mild and moderate. Severe infections were most likely bacterial, i.e pneumonia, urinary tract infections and cellulitis. However, there are always rare exceptions to the rule; for example, a single case report of fulminant hepatitis associated with an unusual echovirus-25 infection in a patient on ocrelizumab therapy (Nicolini et al., 2019; Novi G, Mikulska M, Briano F, Toscanini F, Tazza F, Uccelli A, Inglese M, 2020) .",

For patients with highly active MS, the consequences of delaying treatment or delaying access to high efficacy therapies need to be considered carefully, particularly as the risks of COVID-19 to individual immunosuppressed patients can be managed with selfisolation and shielding. Witholding immunosuppressive therapies in active MS may unintentionally increase the chances of severe COVID-19. The real-world data that is being collected currently will hopefully provide us with a definitive answer to these questions. The existing and emerging data indicate that anti-CD20 therapies are likely to be safe to initiate and redose during the COVID-19 pandemic.",
