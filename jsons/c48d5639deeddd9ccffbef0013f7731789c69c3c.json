As of April 20, 2020, the cumulative incidence of global COVID-19 has exceeded 2 million, and the number of death is close to 200000 [1] [2] [3] . Studies have shown that the pathogen of COVID-19 is \u03b2 -coronavirus, and its gene sequence is highly similar to that of SARS and MERS [4] . The source and specific route of transmission of the virus are still unclear. The principal target organ of COVID-19 is the human lung, and some studies have shown that the virus can damage the heart, liver, nervous system, and so on [5] [6] [7] . Liver injury was also noted in SARS and MERS. Guan (158/741). Among the 99 cases reported by Chen et al, there were 43 cases of abnormal liver function. These findings seemed to imply that there was a definite relationship between novel coronavirus and liver injury [8] [9] [10] . However, the effect of COVID-19 on liver injury is still unclear and requires further study.",

At present, the mechanism of liver injury in patients with COVID-19 includes SARS-CoV-2 virus directly attacking liver tissue, and the target receptor of SARS-CoV-2 is the ACE2 receptor. However, previous studies have shown that the ACE2 receptor is highly expressed in intrahepatic bile duct epithelial cells but is expressed at low levels in hepatocytes [68, 69] . Therefore, it is possible for the SARS-CoV-2 virus to directly damage the intrahepatic biliary system, but it is less likely to directly damage hepatocytes. In our study, we also found that GGT is a marker of bile duct injury. ALP increased, but only 7 cases were reported. The mechanism of secondary liver injury includes the inflammatory storm effect caused by systemic inflammation, drug factors and multiple organ dysfunction caused by hypoxia.

The trend of ICU was similar to that of non-ICU patients. This conclusion is consistent with the clinical characteristics of patients with COVID liver injury analysed by Qi et al [7] . All these findings suggest that the more serious the COVID infection, the higher the risk of liver injury and the more severe the injury. The more intense the infection symptoms of critically ill patients are, the greater the impact of the storm of inflammatory factors on liver function. In addition, most of patients included in the study were diagnosed between January and February 2020, who were treated promptly, when the drug treatment of critically ill patients is often uncertain, and antiviral, antibiotic, and traditional Chinese medicine treatments are often combined.

Additionally, patients with severe COVID-19 often have hypoxemia, which leads to hepatocyte ischaemia and hypoxia, and multiple organ failure may also be one of the causes of liver damage. Therefore, secondary liver injury is more common in critically ill patients, but the possibility of direct liver injury caused by COVID-19 cannot be ruled out.",
