In children, the incidence of influenza following allogeneic HSCT ranges between 0.9 and 9.9% [4\u20138]. Administration of one dose of the seasonal inactivated influenza vaccine is recommended for children commencing 6 months following HSCT. Children aged 6 months to 8 years who have never previously been vaccinated should receive two doses, 4 or more weeks apart [9, 10]. However, these recommendations are based on adult studies [10], with a distinct paucity of paediatric-specific data assessing the immunogenicity of the inactivated influenza vaccine following HSCT [11]. Given the lack of evidence, we undertook a prospective multicentre study to evaluate the immunogenicity of the seasonal inactivated influenza vaccine in children who have undergone allogeneic HSCT compared with healthy matched controls, and to identify risk factors that predict vaccine response in this population.",

Susceptibility of the healthy age-matched controls was 37% to H3N2, 70% to H1N1 and 79% to the B strain. Seroprotection occurred in 81.4% to H3N2, 41.9% to H1N1 and 44.2% to B strain in children who received allogeneic HSCT compared with 97.7%, 81.4% and 69.8% for healthy age-matched controls (Table 2). Seroconversion occurred in 60.5% for H3N2, 32.6% for H1N1 and 39.5% for B strain in children who received allogeneic HSCT, while 72.1%, 65.1% and 58.1% of healthy age-matched controls seroconverted to the respective strains (Table 2). For children in the HSCT group who received two doses of the vaccine and seroconverted, the second dose of the vaccine was required for seroconversion to occur in 47% of patients to H3N2, 70% to H1N1 and 81% to B strain.",

Vaccination with inactivated influenza vaccine represents the main strategy to prevent infection. Several studies have been conducted to determine immunogenicity of the inactivated influenza vaccine in adults who have undergone HSCT, however, there is a distinct lack of paediatric-specific data [11]. Our study demonstrates that the inactivated influenza vaccine is safe and elicits a statistically significant serological response to H3N2 and B strains in children who have undergone allogeneic HSCT. However, serological response was limited in comparison with healthy age-matched controls. The only study from which meaningful paediatric-specific data can be extrapolated for comparison between children who have undergone allogeneic HSCT is from a mixed paediatric-adult study [17]. In this study, seroconversion rates in 27 of the study participants under the age of 18 years were 59.3% for H3N2, 55.6% for H1N1 and 40.7% for B strain. Our current study shows comparable seroconversion rates to the H3N2 and B strains, but showed an inferior seroconversion rate to H1N1. There were notable differences between the H1N1 viruses tested in both of these studies as the Yalcin et al. [17] study was conducted over the 2007\u20132008 influenza season, when the previous seasonal influenza H1N1 vaccine was used, in comparison with our study, which used a post-2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza virus.",

For the H1N1 strain, statistical significance was not achieved according to GMFI criteria and the numerical thresholds of >70% for seroprotection and >40% for seroconversion were not attained. However, interpretation of these findings should also take into consideration that the CPMP criteria were defined based on applicability to immunocompetent populations, further emphasised by satisfaction of the criteria against all three strains in our age-matched healthy control population.

Guerin-El Khourouj et al. identified a cellular proliferative response to H1N1 strain in 11 of 14 children following vaccination 76\u2013336 days post allogeneic HSCT. H1N1 antibody titres were also measured in eight participants, with seroconversion only occurring in one patient following vaccination [19]. Although small numbers, both studies are important as they demonstrate that despite the absence of an influenza-specific antibody response, there was generation of an influenza-specific T-cell response. This finding is supported by an adult study, which identified a strong cell-mediated immune response to a single dose of the trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine in 14 patients following allogeneic HSCT, despite a poor influenza-specific antibody response [20]. This further highlights the potential to consider alternative measures to determine vaccine efficacy in immunocompromised populations, in addition to those defined by the CPMP.",

Although both studies were not able to identify a significant benefit for administration of two doses of the trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine compared with one dose [21, 22], the benefit of a second vaccine dose has been demonstrated in several studies which have assessed response to the AS03-adjuvanted 2009 H1N1 vaccine in adults post HSCT [23\u201325], while another study identified comparable response to two doses of the AS03-adjuvanted 2009 H1N1 vaccine in adults post allogeneic HSCT to a single dose received by healthy controls [26]. Transplant to vaccination interval [24, 26], presence of graft versus host disease [26], donor type [23] and receipt of immunosuppressive therapy [25] have all been shown to be predictive of response to the AS03-adjuvanted 2009 H1N1 vaccine within these studies. Although this is the largest paediatric study to assess immunogenicity of the inactivated influenza vaccine following allogeneic HSCT, greater patient numbers are required to further validate the variables that have been assessed and to identify whether additional variables, such as presence of graft versus host disease, receipt of immunosuppressive therapy, donor type and stem cell source, predict response to vaccination.",

In a previous retrospective study, the clinical efficacy of influenza vaccination in HSCT recipients was identified as 80% [27]. However, in the modern era, all patients who have undergone allogeneic HSCT are recommended to receive inactivated influenza vaccination [10], thus precluding assessment of vaccine efficacy due to the low number of unvaccinated patients. This highlights the need for alternative measures to determine the clinical efficacy of influenza vaccine for patients receiving HSCT. Incidence of laboratory-proven influenza infection was defined as the clinical endpoint for this study, limited to one case occurring in the HSCT cohort (2.3%). This patient was typed as having H1N1pdm09 infection in 2014, occurring 50 days following completion of a two dose immunisation schedule, and did not mount protective antibody titres to any strain. The published data regarding clinical effectiveness of the influenza vaccine in HSCT recipients is limited, with reported incidence rates of 10.5% following one dose of the trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine and 4.6% following administration of two doses of AS03-adjuvanted 2009 H1N1 vaccine post allogeneic HSCT [26, 27]. The low incidence of influenza infection in our study may also be influenced by minimising risk of exposure to infection, which is considered standard practice for children who have undergone HSCT [28].",

We identify the need for further research to improve overall vaccine response and immunogenicity to the H1N1 pandemic strain. Receipt of two doses of the inactivated influenza vaccine and a normal lymphocyte count at the time of vaccination were both predictive of response to the B strain, however larger global collaborative studies are required to validate these findings and investigate a greater number of predictive variables. A high proportion of children who received two vaccine doses and seroconverted, required the second dose of the vaccine for seroconversion to each strain. In conclusion, our study provides evidence to support the recommendation for annual administration of inactivated influenza vaccine to children following allogeneic HSCT.",
