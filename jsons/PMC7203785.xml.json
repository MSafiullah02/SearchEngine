            "text": "Human parainfluenza virus type 2 (hPIV-2) is an enveloped, non-segmented, negative-strand RNA virus of the Orthorubulavirus genus of the Paramyxoviridae1 Its genome is composed of six tandem genes encoding the nucleocapsid (NP), phospho- (P), V, matrix (M), hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN), fusion (F), and large (L) proteins (Lamb and Parks, 2013). The unedited faithful copy of the P gene encodes the V open reading frame (ORF), while the edited insertion of two G nucleotides shifts the mRNA to the P ORF at the editing site (Ohgimoto et al., 1990). Thus, N-terminal amino acid sequences of P and V proteins are in common. Although V protein is not essential for hPIV-2 replication, the growth of V-deficient hPIV-2 is remarkably decreased relative to wt hPIV-2 (Nishio et al., 2005; Ohta et al., 2016b) (Table 1). V protein has been found to interact with several host proteins, such as STATs (Nishio et al., 2005), AIP1/Alix (Nishio et al., 2007), TRAF6 (Kitagawa et al., 2013), tetherin (Ohta et al., 2016b), Graf1 (Ohta et al., 2016a), caspase1 (Ohta et al., 2018a), inactive RhoA (Ohta et al., 2018c), and profilin2 (Ohta et al., 2019). Most of these V partners interact with the C-terminal region of V protein containing three Trp and seven Cys residues that form a bowl-shaped depression (Figure 1) (Li et al., 2006). The one exception is Graf1 whose interaction site is the N-terminal V/P common region (Ohta et al., 2016a).",

            "text": "Caveolae are non-clathrin-coated invaginations of the plasma membrane (Anderson, 1998). They regulate lipid homeostasis, membrane tension, trafficking, and endocytosis (Parton and del Pozo, 2013; Shvets et al., 2014). Caveolae are specialized lipid raft microdomains enriched in cholesterol and sphingolipids (Parton and Simons, 2007). Caveolin and cavin proteins are critical components of caveolae (Hansen and Nichols, 2010). Caveolins are caveolae coat membrane proteins with molecular weights of 20\u201324 kDa (Hansen and Nichols, 2010). Among three caveolin family members (Caveolin1\u20133), Caveolin1 and Caveolin3 are essential for caveolae formation in non-muscle cells and muscle cells, respectively (Drab et al., 2001; Galbiati et al., 2001), while Caveolin2 is dispensable (Razani et al., 2002). Cavin proteins interact with Caveolin1 to regulate caveolae formation and function (Hill et al., 2008). Cavin proteins are key cytoplasmic components of caveolae with molecular weights of 31\u201347 kDa (Hansen and Nichols, 2010). All cavin proteins (Cavin1\u20134) contain leucine zippers (LZs), PEST domains (enriched in Pro, Glu, Ser, and Thr residues), and phosphatidylserine binding sites. Cavin1 is recruited to the plasma membrane by caveolins, and is also required for caveolae formation (Hill et al., 2008; Liu and Pilch, 2008). Cavin2 promotes Cavin1 recruitment to caveolae and induces caveolae curvature (Hansen et al., 2009). Cavin3 is involved in the intracellular transport of caveolae (McMahon et al., 2009). Both Cavin2 and Cavin3 can bind to Cavin1, suggesting that these cavin proteins coordinate with each other to regulate caveolae formation (Hansen et al., 2009; Mohan et al., 2015).",

Simian virus 40 (SV40), human coronavirus 229E, and hepatitis B virus enter cells through caveolae-dependent endocytosis (Pelkmans et al., 2001; Nomura et al., 2004; Macovei et al., 2010). Caveolin1 has important roles in particle formation of several enveloped viruses. Parainfluenza virus type 5 (PIV-5), a member of the family Paramyxoviridae, facilitates its assembly and budding at the surface of the plasma membrane by the binding of its M protein with Caveolin1, resulting in the promotion of viral growth (Ravid et al., 2010). Although the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) protein that interacts with Caveolin1 has not been identified, filaments of RSV colocalize with Caveolin1, suggesting the importance of Caveolin1 for RSV virion maturation (Brown et al., 2002). Caveolin1 also promotes growth of influenza A virus (IAV) via interaction between Caveolin1 and its M2 protein (Sun et al., 2010). Caveolin1 seems to recruit viral components to where these viruses assemble and bud. In contrast, the role of cavin proteins during viral infection is poorly understood.",

We examined whether Cavin3 expression increases at the level of transcripts, but the mRNA level was not affected by hPIV-2 infection (Figure 2B). Cavin3 possesses two PEST sequences (Izumi et al., 1997), suggesting its rapid degradation. We therefore performed pulse-chase experiments of Cavin3 in hPIV-2-infected cells. HeLa cells were infected with hPIV-2 at an MOI of 1 for 1 day (or mock-infected), followed by pulse-labeling with [35S]methionine/cysteine. After 1, 2, and 4 h incubation, a greater amount of labeled Cavin3 remained in wt hPIV-2-infected cells than in mock-infected cells (Figure 2C, upper panel and Figure 2D). Inhibition of proteasomal degradation by MG132 resulted in suppression of Cavin3 degradation in both mock-infected and hPIV-2-infected cells (Figure 2C, middle panel and Figure 2D). hPIV-2 infection apparently inhibits proteasome-dependent degradation of Cavin3.",

To examine whether these residues are involved in binding with Cavin3, Trp-mutated V proteins (VW: VW178H/W182E/W192A) and Cys-mutated (VC1: VC193/197A, VC2: VC209/211/214A, and VC3: VC218/221A) (Figure 1) were subjected to immunoprecipitation. Trp mutation lost the Cavin3 binding capacity, while all Cys mutants could bind to Cavin3 (Figure 4A, lanes 5\u20138). To identify the Cavin3 region important for V protein binding, three deletion mutants of Cavin3 with C-terminal FLAG tag were prepared (Figure 4B). Deletion of aa 1\u201378 of Cavin3 (\u0394N78) did not affect V binding (Figure 4C, lane 3). In contrast, N-terminally deleted Cavin3 consisting of aa 125\u2013261 (N\u0394124) and aa 140\u2013261 (N\u0394139) could not bind to the V protein (Figure 4C, lanes 4 and 5). Thus, aa 79\u2013124 of Cavin3 are important for the binding to V protein.",

HeLa/wt V, HeLa/VW178H/W182E/W192A (HeLa/VW), and HeLa/ctrl were treated with lysis buffer containing 1% TritonX-100 at 4\u00b0C, and the amount of Cavin3 in detergent-insoluble fractions was quantified using immunoblotting. We confirmed the soluble/insoluble fractionation using Caveolin1 (a raft marker) and Clathrin (a non-raft marker) (Figure 6A). The expression levels of Cavin3 in the soluble fractions were not affected by wt V protein (Figure 6A, lanes 1\u20132). Insoluble fractions in HeLa/wt V contained significantly larger amounts of Cavin3 than those in HeLa/ctrl (Figure 6A, lanes 4\u20135 and Figure 6B). In contrast, the expression level of Cavin3 in HeLa/VW178H/W182E/W192A was similar to that in HeLa/ctrl in both soluble and insoluble fractions (Figure 6A, lanes 1, 3, 4, and 6).

V protein seems to both positively and negatively regulate the stability of some host proteins. We expected that Cavin3 would be degraded through the calpain-dependent pathway because it possesses PEST sequences (Rogers et al., 1986; Shumway et al., 1999). Its degradation was inhibited, however, by MG132, a proteasome inhibitor (Figure 2C, middle panel). Cavin1 and Cavin2, both of which contain PEST sequences, are also degraded by the proteasome pathway (Breen et al., 2012; Tillu et al., 2015). PEST sequence is reported to be involved in proteasome-dependent degradation pathways (Spencer et al., 2004). However, as shown in Figure 4C, PEST sequences in Cavin3 were not the binding sites with V protein. V protein does not seem to directly mask the Cavin3 PEST sequences. Ubiquitylation of Lys residues within the phosphoinositide-binding site of Cavin1 leads to its degradation (Tillu et al., 2015). As aa 79\u2013124 of Cavin3 was found to contain the V binding site (Figure 4C), V protein might mask the ubiquitylation sites within this region of Cavin3 by its binding.",

Cavin3 level in lipid rafts (insoluble fractions) was increased by V protein (Figure 6A, lane 5). These results suggest the involvement of Cavin3 in the assembly and budding of hPIV-2 since lipid rafts are assembly and budding sites for several enveloped viruses, including measles virus (Vincent et al., 2000), Newcastle disease virus (NDV) (Laliberte et al., 2006), RSV (Brown et al., 2002), and IAV (Scheiffele et al., 1999; Takeda et al., 2003).

Caveolin1 binds to aromatic amino acid-rich region (FXXXXWXXF, corresponding to aa 355\u2013363) of PIV-5 M (Ravid et al., 2010). As this region is conserved in hPIV-2 M protein, hPIV-2 M protein seems to be clustered by Caveolin1. A faint amount of V protein was detected in detergent-insoluble fractions (Figure 6A, lane 5). V protein might interact with Cavin3 before the recruitment of Cavin3 to the lipid rafts. The V protein in detergent-insoluble fractions (Figure 6A, lane 5) may have been recruited by Cavin3. The role of V\u2013Cavin3 interaction appears to be quite different from that between Caveolin1 and the viral proteins. It is reported that Cavin3 interacts with Cavin1 and Caveolin1, which leads to an increase in surface dynamics of caveolae (Mohan et al., 2015). hPIV-2 V protein might enhance the Cavin3-induced activation of caveolae dynamics by stabilizing Cavin3 expression.",
