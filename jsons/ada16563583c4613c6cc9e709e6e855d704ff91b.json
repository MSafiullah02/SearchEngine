The skin is a protective barrier with large numbers of colonizing bacteria. The skin microbiome is inhabited by bacteria, fungi, viruses, archaea, and mites; however most research has focused on bacteria. The presence of various microbes may influence disease as evidenced by the shift from Staphylococcus epidermidis cultured from healthy skin in young children [3] to Propionibacterium acnes in teenagers with acne [4, 5] . Children with atopic dermatitis have a propensity to infection with Staphylococcus aureus [6] . Loss of skin integrity, as with wounds, burns, inflammation, or invasive devices, allows pathogens to enter.",

The gut provides both an essential immune response in maintaining health with normal flora stimulating proliferation of epithelial cells in small and large intestines, participating in development of competent gut-associated immune responses, as well as providing a physical barrier function against pathogen invasion through colonization resistance [10] [11] [12] . Inflammatory bowel disease is just one example of altered gut flora associated with a disease state. The secretory antibody system is important in the defense against mucosal infections. Specific secretory immunoglobulin A (IgA), transported through secretory epithelia to the mucosal surface, inhibits pathogen colonization through microorganism entrapment in mucus and promotion of clearance of entrapped microbes via peristalsis or mucociliary movement [13] . IgA also plays a role in mucosal protection of the gut by binding to a mucous layer that separates commensal bacteria from the apical surface of intestinal epithelial cells [14] .",

However, a retrospective study in the USA failed to demonstrate benefit when nasal mupirocin was used for 5 days in colonized neonates in a unit with a baseline prevalence of around 2% [87] . This study showed that some NICU infants develop infection prior to detection of colonization and infants who remain in the NICU can become recolonized over time [87] . Taken together, these data suggest that decolonization measures may be most beneficial when the baseline rate of colonization is high. Additional NICU studies have found a high correlation between colonizing strains and infecting strains and confirmed high rates (42%) of infections occurring before colonization is detected suggesting universal, rather than targeted, decolonization should be used to control the spread of MRSA [74] . Current recommendations suggest that decolonization may be considered in highrisk neonates during an MRSA outbreak or in cases of endemic MRSA when other measures are failing [88] . A recent Society for Hospital Epidemiology Association (SHEA) survey regarding practices for MRSA identification and eradication in NICUs noted that most (86%) performed surveillance screening (AST) for MRSA in neonates with variability in timing of samples, sites sampled, isolation protocols, and decolonization strategies employed [89] .",

These two strategies have been studied in more than 50 RCTs and have been examined in 12 metaanalyses with demonstrated efficacy in reduction of colonization, morbidity, and mortality in adult ICU patients [115] [116] [117] . Widespread acceptance has been limited by concern over selecting for resistant organisms in universal applications, although long-term follow-up in units employing these strategies have not demonstrated an increase in resistant organisms [118] . Microbiome studies of adults undergoing SDD compared to healthy adults revealed dramatic shifts in the gastrointestinal microbiome of SDD recipients (as would be expected) as well as an increase in the relative abundance of organisms expressing antimicrobial resistance genes [119] .",

The choice of antimicrobial is based upon a need for bactericidal activity against the expected pathogens for specific surgical procedures as well as agents which are known to be safe and cost-effective. The goal is to provide bactericidal concentrations in tissues and serum at the time of incision and to be continued throughout the entire operation until the wound is closed.

In certain very high-risk populations, however, such as cardiac and orthopedic surgery patients, preoperative chlorhexidine bathing has been associated with reduced rates of SSI (especially those due to S. aureus or MRSA) [123] [124] [125] . It is likely that the benefits of chlorhexidine bathing are influenced by the type of surgical procedure (i.e., high-risk vs. low-risk) as well as the baseline rate of SSI at a given institution. In spite of these controversies, the use of chlorhexidine body wash prior to surgery is routine.",

Assessing adequacy of cleaning can be performed using various methods including observation for visible soiling, culture-based colony counts, fluorescent dye, and ATP detection. For example, fluorescent dye can be applied as a dot to surfaces where it dries clear. If a surface was inadequately wiped, the area fluoresces when exposed to black light. ATP bioluminescence systems measure ATP, a marker for presence of residual organic material (e.g., human secretions or excretions and food). ATP, however, does not indicate presence of viable pathogens, and its absence does not rule out the presence of contamination, and as such, use of fluorescent dye correlates more closely with colony counts than does ATP bioluminescence [137] .",

Water is ubiquitous in its use throughout the hospital, not only for routine sanitation but also for air conditioning, mechanical ventilation, bathing, as well as the cleaning and processing of equipment. Certain organisms have special predilection for moist environments and include gram-negative bacilli, nontuberculous mycobacteria, fungi, and some viruses. In a recent review of waterborne healthcare-associated infections, 41 of 125 reports described hospitalized children [149] . The organisms primarily responsible included Legionella (hot water distribution systems), Pseudomonas (bottled water), and Burkholderia (distilled and sterile water contamination) [149] . Generally, tap water is the most frequently reported source of infection, with contamination at the sink, shower, and bathtub. Legionella was the primary cause of HAI among all the patients included in this review and was the predominant organism causing outbreaks [149] . Legionella outbreaks have been reported in premature neonates associated with the humidification trays of incubators [150] and in term neonates associated with cold mist humidifiers [151] .",
