The particle counting techniques have been developed further to detect single DNA molecule (Akeson et al. 1999; Kasianowicz et al. 1996) and analyze DNA contents (Sohn et al. 2000). However, the conventional particle counting methods rely on costly, bulky, and complex instruments and require a large amount of samples and reagents. These are the barriers to many particle counting applications.",

Lithographic fabrication technique makes possible building inexpensive and small devices integrated with electrodes and sensors, and microfluidic control technologies such as electrokinetics (Li 2004) are able to control particles and liquid flow in micro- and nano-channels. In addition, microfluidic devices are particularly useful for applications where a very small quantity of samples is available or desired. Microfluidics-based particle counting methods have great advantages over the conventional methods and allow the development of accurate, cheap, and portable particle counting devices.",

            "text": "Coulter Counter perhaps is the most popular conventional method of particle counting. We review this method first for two reasons: it gives a general perspective of conventional particle counting methods, and its working principle of measuring electric resistive pulse is used in some microfluidic particle counting methods. Coulter Counter was first invented by Wallace H. Coulter during World War II and patented (Coulter 1953). When Coulter worked for US Navy, he used this technique to count the number of plankton particles that always caused large echoes on Sonar. In a Coulter counter, a small aperture on the wall is immersed into a container that has particles suspended in low concentration electrolyte solution. Two electrodes are placed: one in front and one behind the aperture, and a current path is provided by the electrolyte when an electric field is applied (Fig. 1) and the aperture creates a \u201csensing zone.\u201d As a particle passes through the aperture, a volume of electrolyte, equivalent to the immersed volume of the particle is displaced from the sensing zone. This causes a short-term change in the impedance across the aperture. This change can be measured as a voltage pulse or a current pulse. The pulse height is proportional to the volume of the sensed particle. If a constant particle density is assumed, the pulse height is also proportional to the particle mass. This technology thus is also called aperture technology.\n",

            "text": "Because the Coulter counter is simple, highly sensitive, and reliable, it is widely applied in many areas including medical instruments such as counting and analysis of blood cells (Horne et al. 2005), protein (Kulp et al. 2004), and viruses (Wahl-Jensen et al. 2007) besides detecting fine particles and pollen (DeBlois and Bean 1970). Before the Coulter counter was invented, complete blood counts (CBCs) were carried out manually with a telescope and static samples, which is time-consuming and inaccurate. With the Coulter counter, CBCs can be done for a large amount of samples in a very short period of time. When Coulter first demonstrated the Coulter counter, it could count red blood cells at a high count rate of 6,000 particles/s, which revolutionized the science of hematology. Within a decade, literally every hospital laboratory in the US had Coulter counters, and today every modern hematology analyzer adopts the Coulter principle in some way. For example, Coulter counters may measure the change of impedance (Carbonaro and Sohn 2005; Jagtiani et al. 2006a, b; Zhe et al. 2007; Wu et al. 2008a, b), conductance (Sohn et al. 2000; Murali et al. 2009), and reflected radio frequency power (Wood et al. 2005) when a particle passes the aperture.",

After the technical advance of micro-fabrication (Rogers and Nuzzo 2005), the RPS method has been applied to count particles moving in microchannels.

Therefore, it is mostly applicable for portable lab-on-a-chip (LOC) devices to detect biopolymers such as DNA, protein, and blood cells. However, the flow rate of the microfluidic RPS is small and the sensitivity of the microfluidic RPS is limited by its aperture size, resulting in poor throughput and sensitivity. To overcome these shortcomings, recent researches on microfluidic RPS focus on two main issues: improving of the sensitivity and enhancing of the throughput. The RPS throughput is evaluated by particle flow rate at the aperture or the number of the counted particles at a given time. Its sensitivity is determined directly by the volume ratio of the detected particles and the aperture and can be adjusted by controlling the amplification gain of the electronic circuit or instrument and the noise reduction from the fluidic network and the electronic sensing system.",

To improve the sensitivity, Xu et al. (2007) and Sridhar et al. (2008) used a relatively wide polydimethyl siloxane (PDMS) channel of 16 \u03bcm with metal-oxide-semiconductor-field-effect-transistor (MOSFET). They detected particles by monitoring the MOSFET drain current modulation instead of the modulation in the ionic current though the sensing channel and achieved ten times smaller minimum volume ratio of 0.006% than that of DeBlois and Bean. Recently, Wu et al. (2008a, b) developed a microfluidic RPS method utilizing a mirror symmetric channel structure and a two-stage differential amplifier (Fig. 2). They could significantly reduce the noise and achieve a much better signal-to-noise ratio. This sensing scheme detected 520-nm diameter polystyrene particles with a 20-\u03bcm sensing gate and improved a minimum volume ratio to as low as 0.0004%, which is about ten times more sensitive than the current commercial Coulter counter of 0.0037% (Beckman Counlter\u00ae Multisizer\u2122 4). The principle of the symmetric dual channel design is to make noise levels for the output signals (VD1 and VD2 as indicated in Fig. 2) from both gate branches identical and hence the noises can be canceled by a subtraction electronic circuit. However, ideal noise subtraction is not possible due to realistic limitation to fabricate the identical dual channels. Furthermore, this dual channel method will not be able to detect particles when two particles pass the two apertures at the same time because the two signals with the similar amplitude will be subtracted by each other and cancelled at the second stage of differential amplifier.\n",

            "text": "The throughput of a single-channel Coulter counter is proportional to the square of the diameter of the detecting aperture. When submicron-or nanometer-size particles are to be counted, the size of the aperture has to be scaled down to submicron or nanometer in order to maintain the sensitivity. Otherwise, the signal-to-noise ratio will be very low. While the sensitivity of the single-gate microfluidic RPS method is much higher, it requires long detecting time due to low flow rate in a microchannel and using of diluted samples to avoid multiple particles flowing together. To overcome this low throughput issue, multi-counting techniques are developed. Carbonaro and Sohn (2005) first demonstrated the simultaneous immunoassays of two different human antigens by integrate multiple artificial pores and the RPS technique on a single chip. Coulter and Hogg (1976) patented the particle analyzing apparatus and method with multiple sensing apertures. However, it is difficult to integrate the detection circuit and independent power supply of their systems on one chip. Zhe group (Jagtiani et al. 2006a, b) proposed a multi-aperture Coulter counter, which consists of four peripheral reservoirs and a central reservoir (Fig. 4a). Each peripheral reservoir is connected to the central reservoir through a miniature channel. Their results showed that the sensor can detect and count particles through its four sensing apertures simultaneously. However, the four apertures are the maximum number of apertures that can be built in a single chip due to the configuration limit. Furthermore, Zhe group (Zhe et al. 2007) proposed different high throughput single chip counter using multiple channels, operating in parallel with single common sample reservoir and a power source (Fig. 4b). This counter was capable of differentiating and counting polymethacrylate particles and Juniper pollen about three times faster than single channel counter. This concept could be extended to multi-channel microfluidic chips in the future to improve the counting efficiency.\n",

Kasianowicz et al. (1996) showed that they were able to sense single-stranded RNA and DNA through a 2.6 nm diameter ion channel in a lipid bilayer membrane. This promising result sparked many studies of DNA translocation and dynamics in biological nanopores. Akeson et al. (1999) detected single DNA and RNA molecules in an \u03b1-hemolysin channel driven by an applied electric field (Fig. 5). Since the small-sized pore can hold only one strand of DNA or RNA at a time, nucleotides within the polynucleotide must pass through the channel/pore in sequential and single-file order during the translocation. In this process, not only counting but also discriminating between pyrimidine and purine segments along a DNA or RNA molecule can be accomplished. A very important application of this research is the direct sequencing of individual DNA and RNA molecules with a nanopore. In addition, nanopore method was used to measure small particles like metal ions, nucleic acids, and other types of polymers in a less than 10 nm channel (Biance et al. 2006).\n",

Therefore, efforts have been made to fabricate artificial, solid-state nanopores to overcome this limitation. The nanopores based on synthetic material are generally made in silicon compound membranes, such like silicon nitride. Manufacturing technique could be focused ion beam (FIB) sculpting or electron beam sculpting. Martin group did a series of research on synthetic conical nanopores for biosensing applications (Siwy et al. 2005; Harrell et al. 2006; Wharton et al. 2007; Sexton et al. 2007). They made a conical pore with a 1.5 mm base diameter and a 40-nm tip diameter and sensed a single-stranded phage DNA of 7,250 bp and a double-stranded plasmid DNA of 6,600 bp. They also detected protein in the same way. Alternatively, Ito et al. (2004) utilized a 132 nm multiwall carbon nanotube (MWNT) to detect 28\u201390 nm nano-particles. Synthetic nanopores are chemically and structurally stable; however, it is still hard to control the size of these nanochannels. Reproducing synthetic nanopores of the same size is hardly possible.

The capacitance counter is particularly useful for detecting particles in liquids of low electrical conductance because the resistance change due to the passage of a particle is difficult to measure in a poor conducting liquid (Murali et al. 2009). In the past, the capacitance measurements have generally been used to identify bulk materials and to investigate ensembles of biological cells. However, Sohn et al. (2000) employed this technique to detect and quantify the polarization responses of DNA in the nucleus of single eukaryotic cells. They built an integrated microfluidic device (Fig. 6), and used a syringe pump to deliver the liquid to the device. A capacitance bridge at a frequency of 1 kHz across the device was used to detect the capacitance change to determine the DNA content of single eukaryotic cell. Additionally, they demonstrated the relationship between the capacitance and the DNA content of a cell. Recently, Murali et al. (2009) adopted the capacitance counter to monitor of the wear debris in lubrication oil to avoid catastrophic system failure of machine in real-time. Unlike bulk measurement methods, they could scan each individual particle and determine the size of particles without being affected by the change of oil properties. Particles from 10 to 25 \u03bcm were successfully detected.\n",

Furthermore, it can monitor changes in DNA contents and cell-cycle kinetics so that it may serve as a medical diagnostic device to identify the presence of malignancy in very small quantities of tissue such as tumor cell and monitor in real-time of the effects of pharmacological agents on cell cycle and cell death. The capacitance method, however, has complications resulting from the charge-screening effects at the electrode-conductive liquid interface in an electronic measurement, which prevents the interpretation of the absolute capacitance value. Besides, due to AC voltage and frequency required to detect the capacitance, frequency modulation controller is necessary and external support such as a syringe pump is required to deliver a liquid in a channel.

The difference between these two counters lies in how the interaction between the light and the particle is measured for counting particles.

As shown in Fig. 7a, when the source light hits the particle, some of the light is reflected and the reflected light can be detected by a photo-detector positioned at a spot with a certain angle from the light path. In general, the detector is placed at the angle of 20\u00b0\u201340\u00b0 from the light path to the particle. The strength of detected light signal corresponds to particle size, and the number of pulses of the detected light signal is proportional to number of particles. On the other hand, the light-blocking counter (Fig. 7b) measures the light absorbed or reflected away from the detector by the particle. In this arrangement, the light is focused directly onto the detector; when the particle passes between them, and the photo-detector senses the sudden change in the light intensity by a blocking particle. It is obvious that the larger the particle, the more light it will block. In principle, the light-scattering counter detects light while the light-blocking counter detects the darkness. The light-scattering method is more sensitive than the light-blocking method. This is the same principle that detecting a light in a darkroom is easier than detecting a dark spot in a bright room due to the diffuse reflectance caused by solid surfaces and particles in space. However, in order to focus and detect the scattered light at a specific angle, the light-scattering counter system normally contains more optical elements and complex electronic circuit, which makes the light-scattering counter more expensive than the light-blocking counter. The light-blocking counter is widely used in detecting particles in water (e.g., water treatment application) while the light-scattering counter is mostly used in detecting atmospheric particles. The key disadvantage of these light-scattering and light-blocking counters is the low sensitivity in comparison to the Coulter counter because the sensitivity of these light-based particle counters are determined by the particle\u2019s surface area while the sensitivity of the Coulter counter is decided by the volume of the particle.\n",

They detected scattering light at two different angles of 15\u00b0 and 45\u00b0. The experiment was carried out on a polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) microchip which consists of three inlet channels of two buffers and one sample channel and one outlet channel. The fluid was driven by syringe pump generating a negative pressure with a flow rate of 1 \u03bcl/s to neglect the hydrostatic pressure in the inlet reservoirs. A beam splitter and an objective lens are applied to confine the He\u2013Ne laser inside the channel to avoid scattering on the wall. The scattering light signals are sensed by two optical fibers and amplified by a photomultiplier tube (PMT). By this method, the authors realized the particle detection of 2\u20139 \u03bcm. In addition, size discrimination of particles with a diameter ratio of 1:2 was achieved. On the other hand, the standard deviation from the average scattering light intensity for a given particle population was high, up to 30%, and a wide laser beam led to overall lower scattering light intensity and higher background scattering from the channel walls. These cause problems for measurement of smaller particles due to the lower scattering intensity and the lower signal-to-noise ratio. Xiang et al. (2005) utilized the light-blocking technique and developed a multifunctional particle detection system with embedded optical fibers in a PDMS chip to detect moving micro particles in a microchannel. They developed a PDMS-glass microfluidic chip with two pairs of embedded optical fibers and removed the glass cladding layer of the input and receiving fibers. By filling the gap between the fiber and the fiber channel with PDMS, the light leakage from the fiber core and the light scattering from the fiber tips were minimized. By using the two-fiber detection method, particle velocity as well as particle counting and size identification were possible. They achieved counting of 10, 20, and 25 \u03bcm particles. To get a better signal, both input and receiving fibers must be perfectly aligned. They used larger size of the receiving fiber to improve this problem. However, in real applications, careful handling of the fiber-embedded chip and highly controlled fiber alignment are required.",

Laser passes a filter cube and optical fiber to excite particles inside the micro-channel. The excited fluorescence is also detected by the same fiber and translated to electrical signals in the photo detector.

In the experiments, the authors successfully detected and counted 5\u201320 \u03bcm fluorescent particles, white blood cells, and yeast cells. The major advantage of this method is no embedded optic fiber. The glass substrate works as the interface between the detection fiber and fluorescent particle.

This method may be used to the quantitative study of platelet aggregation in blood flow and become a powerful diagnostic tool in the future. The image processing procedure demands complicated computational work and microscopic instrument, resulting in high cost, additional post processing, and large system.",

Microfluidic RPS has been studied and demonstrated to have significantly higher sensitivity than the commercial Coulter counter with low cost. Furthermore, the RPS technique extends to nano-size by utilizing natural or synthetic nanopore to detect single DNA/RNA. For applications in liquids of low electrical conductance, microfluidic capacitance measurement has been used instead of resistance measurement for particle counting. The light-scattering and the light-blocking methods can also be applied in microfluidic chips and have a little lower sensitivity than RPS technique. However, they are more applicable in applications involving higher density particles. Fluorescent detection has an advantage in identifying specific particles among similar sized particles because the fluorescence method has higher specificity than any other electrical measurement. Micro PIV technique can perform particle counting and analyzing the flow filed simultaneously.",

Therefore, the enhancement of the counting speed as well as stable and sensitive detection over a longer period of time is among the challenging issues. Furthermore, in order to meet the demand of the complex analytical detection in real applications, the integration of multiple particle counting methods in a single microfluidic system should be investigated.",
