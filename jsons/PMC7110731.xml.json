The real-time estimation involves two epidemiological biases. A well-known issue during the course of an epidemic is right censoring; i.e., many of cases have not passed through the time required for themselves to die, and thus, the crude ratio of the cumulative numbers of deaths to cases could underestimate the CFR.3, 4, 5 Another issue for the estimation of CFR is the ascertainment bias; i.e., the reported cases may not represent a substantial part of the total number of infections, and thus, the ratio of confirmed deaths to cases may overestimate the actual risk of death that might be perceived as the risk among all infected individuals.6, 7 So far, the CFR among diagnosed cases for MERS is 40%,8 but that among secondary cases may be around 20%.9\n",

First, in the Republic of Korea, extensive contact tracing and quarantine have been carried out.10, 11, 18, 19. Thus, while our estimate of the CFR was initially consistent with 40% (e.g. in mid-June in Figure 2A), ascertainment rate in Korea could have been improved over time, and increased diagnostic coverage may have been reflected in the CFR estimate during the latter half stage of this outbreak. Second, we have found that the CFR among elderly persons age 60 years or older was as high as 40%, while that among younger individuals was as low as 7%. As an underlying mechanism of the time-dependent decrease in the CFR, our estimate of the CFR in Korea may have been sensitive to the fraction of cases with comorbidities. That is, if the early cluster of cases represents elderly with underlying comorbidity which has transmitted the disease to healthier individuals in the later stage of the outbreak, that could partly explain why the estimated CFR decreased over time.",

The crude ratio is calculated as the ratio of cumulative numbers of deaths to cases, which likely underestimates the risk of death and may increase over the course of calendar time. The whiskers of estimated CFR extend to lower and upper 95% confidence intervals that were computed by the profile likelihood. B. Two-sided binominal test (p-value) as a function of time, comparing adjusted CFR against published values, 20% and 40%. The horizontal dashed grey line corresponds to the threshold value (5%).",
