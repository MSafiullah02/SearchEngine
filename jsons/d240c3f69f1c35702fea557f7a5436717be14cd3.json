In addition, the age of children with MP has decreased and more severe symptoms have presented in older children during the past decade. 6,7 In 2011, MP was more prevalent throughout the country and caused more severe clinical features than at any other time, which may be associated with macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae (unpublished observation).",

However, effects, optimal dose and timing of systemic corticosteroid treatment remain unclear.

The clinical course is typically self-limited and benign; however, rare cases of severe pneumonia can develop despite appropriate antibiotic therapy. We studied the effects of methylprednisolone pulse therapy on severe refractory M. pneumoniae pneumonia in children. Methods: The clinical effects of methylprednisolone therapy were evaluated retrospectively in 12 children with severe refractory M. pneumoniae pneumonia, which was diagnosed serologically. All patients developed respiratory distress, high fever, and initial lobar pneumonic consolidation based on radiological findings. All clinical symptoms deteriorated despite appropriate antibiotic therapy. Thus, children were treated with intravenous methylprednisolone pulse therapy in addition to antibiotics. Results: The average febrile period before admission was 4.9\u00b11.7 days, and fever persisted in all children until steroid administration. Methylprednisolone pulse therapy (30 mg/kg) was given 5.4\u00b12.5 days after admission. After methylprednisolone pulse therapy, clinical symptoms improved in all patients without adverse events. The fever subsided 0-2 hours after initiation of corticosteroid therapy. The abnormal radiological findings resolved within 2.6\u00b11.3 days, and the high C-reactive protein levels (6.7\u00b15.9 mg/dL) on admission decreased to 1.3\u00b11.7 mg/dL within 3.0\u00b11.1 days after starting corticosteroid therapy. Conclusions: Three-day methylprednisolone pulse therapy could be applied to treatment of refractory M. pneumoniae pneumonia despite appropriate antibiotic therapy and appeared to be efficacious and well-tolerated.",

Vital signs of all patients were checked every 2-4 hours daily. Laboratory tests including white blood cell counts, serum aminotransferase and CRP, as well as radiological examinations were determined upon admission and followed up over time. M. pneumoniae infection was confirmed based on detection of M. pneumonia IgM using an indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA, DIESSE Diagnostica Senese, Siena, Italy). The test was performed upon admission, and the positive cutoff value of IgM was established as >1.1 according to the manufacturer's instructions. The cold agglutinin titers of paired serum samples were measured at specific intervals after admission and a positive result was defined as an initial cold agglutinin titer of 1:64 or a fourfold rising titer in double-checked samples. To exclude other respiratory infections, we performed microbiological testing of blood and sputum cultures and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis of several respiratory viruses\u2212influenza viruses, parainfluenza viruses, respiratory syncytial viruses, coronaviruses, human rhinoviruses, adenoviruses and metapneumoviruses\u2212before antibiotic therapy. None of the tests resulted in detection of any other pathogens. All children with severe MP showed clinically high fever, respiratory distress, or initial lobar pneumonic consolidation with or without pleural effusion. All patients were treated initially with macrolides (clarithromycin or roxithromycin) or beta-lactam antibiotics (ampicillin with sulbactam or ceftriaxone). Since symptoms were aggravated despite antibiotic therapy, methylprednisolone was administered intravenously at a dose of 30 mg/kg once daily for 3 consecutive days. Refractory pneumonia was defined as follows: 1) Prolonged fever for 7 days or more or 2) persistent consolidation of more than one lobe of the lung despite appropriate antibiotic treatment, including macrolides.",

            "text": "M. pneumoniae infection is common in children. The clinical courses of MP infection are typically benign and symptoms resolve quickly with antibiotic therapy. 13 In rare cases, MP may develop into severe pneumonia and progress to fatal pneumonia with serious complications, despite appropriate antibiotic treatment. 5, 13 These conditions are known as severe refractory MP. 11, 14 The pathogenesis of severe refractory M. pneumoniae infections is attributed partly to excessive cell-mediated immunity and cyhttp://e-aair.org tokine responses against the pathogens. 9 For pathogenesis, M. pneumoniae shows strong cytoadherence to the host respiratory epithelium. The cytoadherence of M. pneumoniae initiates immune responses and progression toward excessive inflammation in the late serological phase rather than through an early direct invasion phase, which is often implicated in pulmonary or various extrapulmonary manifestations. However, M. pneumoniae may induce pneumonia through local cellular damage by producing superoxide radicals and initiating the innate immune response, including the secretion of proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1\u03b2. 9, 15 Although cytokines and recruitment of lymphocytes play a role in minimizing lung tissue damage by activating host defenses, the immunological reactions ultimately exacerbate the immunological hypersensitivity and contribute to the development of vigorous cell-mediated immune responses, which can lead to pulmonary injury and induce severe clinical illness. 15, 16 In our study, all children were healthy prior to M. pneumoniae infection, and infected children were older than 6 years. Moreover, the markedly elevated CRP concentration (6.7\u00b15.9 mg/dL upon admission and 10.1\u00b18.5 mg/dL before initiation of steroid therapy) reflected the acute severe systemic inflammatory reactions to M. pneumoniae infection, and was suggestive of a welldeveloped immune system. Previous reports associating the host immune status with M. pneumoniae infection showed that the clinical signs and symptoms of MP were more severe in previously healthy young adults, while the clinical manifestations of a relatively immunocompromised host were not as severe. 5 These results agreed with animal study models. 17 In animal studies, pulmonary lesions were not as severe in cell-mediated immune deficient animals compared to controls. 17 Since pathogenesis of severe M. pneumoniae infection is closely related to an excessive, activated cell-mediated immune response to pathogens, immune-suppressive therapy may be valuable. Although the effect of steroids on severe MP is controversial, some reports have shown that temporary steroid therapy results in clinical improvement in children with severe MP. [10] [11] [12] Animal experiments showed that combined treatment of clarithromycin and dexamethasone reduced the lung histopathological score and cytokine levels more than either treatment alone. 18 Steroids can exert immune regulatory and anti-inflammatory effects through several molecular mechanisms, such as inhibition of nuclear factor \u03baB, and also influence natural lung immunity by regulating alveolar macrophages and neutrophils. 19, 20 In our study, all children showed serious clinical features upon admission, possibly caused by excessive inflammatory responses. The symptoms of respiratory distress including high fever and lobar pneumonic consolidation with pleural effusion deteriorated and were refractory despite appropriate antibiotic treatment. The deteriorated clinical and radiological findings of severe refractory MP improved rapidly after intravenous methylprednisolone pulse therapy at a dose of 30 mg/kg once daily for 3 days to suppress immune reactions without adverse events. All patients achieved defervescence within 2 hours, resolution of radiological findings 2.6\u00b11.3 days after initiation of corticoste-roid therapy, and a reduction in CRP levels 3.0\u00b11.1 days after initiation of methylprednisolone pulse therapy.",
