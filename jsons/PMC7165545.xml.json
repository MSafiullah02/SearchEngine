            "text": "Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS\u2010CoV) was first recognized as a cause of severe human respiratory disease in 2012 (Zaki, Van Boheemen, Bestebroer, Osterhaus, & Fouchier, 2012). By July, 2018, there were over 2,200 cases in humans globally, 35% being fatal, mainly from Arabian Peninsula (WHO, 21, July 2018). Although the geographic source of MERS\u2010CoV remains poorly understood, increasing evidence indicates that dromedary camel is a host species for the virus and plays a role in transmission to humans (Reusken et al., 2014). High prevalence of MERS\u2010CoV antibodies in dromedaries in Africa and Arabian Peninsula was demonstrated from sera archived between 1992 and 2012 (Corman et al., 2014; Reusken et al., 2014). Phylogenetic analysis of camel\u2010derived and human\u2010derived sequences from Oman, Qatar and Saudi Arabia match suggested zoonotic transmission (Briese et al., 2014; Reusken et al., 2014).",

The MERS\u2010Co virus is thought to be transmitted from the nasal mucosa and conjunctiva of infected camels, especially through respiratory secretions because viral load has been found to be high in these sites (Azhar, El\u2010Kafrawy, et al., 2014). Camels have been reported to be infected simultaneously with more than one MERS\u2010CoV and re\u2010infection and viral shedding of camels previously infected with the virus had been reported (Farag et al., 2015). This makes those exposed to camels potentially at an elevated risk of exposure compared to the general population.",

An investigation in Egypt, using real\u2010time polymerase chain reaction (RT\u2010PCR) detected MERS\u2010CoV in 3.6% (4 of 110) apparently healthy dromedary camels in a slaughterhouse mainly in camels that had been imported from Sudan or Ethiopia (Chu et al., 2014).

Use of personal protective clothing to prevent direct contact with discharges and aerosols was observed to be low since there was no use of gloves and face masks. As knowledge of camel herders and slaughterhouse workers on MERS\u2010CoV was lacking, these findings provide possible higher\u2010risk activities during slaughter. Slaughterhouse workers\u2019 awareness of zoonotic diseases and their transmission was high enabling them to protect themselves from exposure. Three herders reported drinking raw camel milk, which increases overall risk of exposure to zoonosis.",

In a study carried out in a single county in Kenya, 47% of camels were found to have antibodies (Deem et al., 2015). Another study carried out in Marsabit County showed over 90% sero\u2010prevalence among camels, but none of the humans tested showed presence of antibodies (Munyua et al., 2017). The true incidence of MERS\u2010CoV infections in humans may not actually be known, as most patients could be asymptomatic or present with symptoms similar to influenza, the common cold or other infections known to cause respiratory disease. Antibodies against MERS have been demonstrated in Kenya in two people in an area that has a high camel density (Liljander, et al., 2016). In 2015, in a slaughterhouse in Nigeria, sero\u2010prevalence of mature camels coming for slaughter was found to be 95% (Chu et al., 2015).",

These findings would provide insights into an actual risk of infection in slaughterhouses and could provide an opportunity for further research. In addition, a small number of herders, traders and slaughterhouse workers were enrolled therefore limiting identification of significant differences in the knowledge, practices and beliefs and results may not be generalizable to other traders and herders in Kenya. The low enrollment was because slaughter took place at night and camels were sold to traders back at home. Traders delivered camels to the slaughterhouse and left them in the care of the slaughterhouse workers. Despite these limitations, this study provides useful qualitative information on camel handling and slaughter practices.",

A study conducted in Marsabit County, Kenya, showed that despite 90% sero\u2010prevalence among camels, there was no serological evidence of MERS\u2010CoV exposure among pastoralists, suggesting localized MERS virus transmission patterns (Munyua et al., 2017). Further evaluation of exposure status among persons working with camels would inform development of surveillance and prevention guidelines. This study emphasizes the lack of knowledge about MERS\u2010CoV among slaughterhouse workers. Public health authorities should therefore provide more information to sensitize slaughterhouse workers about MERS and other emerging zoonotic diseases to enable them to better protect themselves to reduce opportunities for potential virus transmission. Biosafety practices for persons who have occupational exposure to camels should be evaluated. Understanding the epidemiology of MERS\u2010CoV in Kenya including transmission and exposure in camels and in persons with occupational exposure to camels will contribute to targeted surveillance, more rapid detection and control of MERS\u2010CoV in Kenya, thereby enhancing global health security.",
