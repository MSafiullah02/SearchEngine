Seven of the nine facilities employed anaerobic digesters; two facilities, both of which were dairy farms, did not. All facilities separated solids. Eight facilities used a screw press, and one used a centrifuge. All facilities with anaerobic digesters separated solids after digestion. In addition to solids separation, three facilities, all of which were dairy farms, also employed some form of secondary solids treatment after separation. Two of these three facilities used an aerobic bedding recovery unit. The third used a blower to dry solids but did not begin using it until the end of May 2012, which was partway through the study (see below for the sampling timeframe).",

First, we assumed that nondetections correspond to microbe concentrations of zero copies per wet gram; this value would most likely underestimate many digester effluent concentrations and thereby cause us to overestimate log removal.

The vast majority of inactivation estimates in our literature review are based exclusively on culture methods (300 of 320 values). The few based on qPCR in this group tend to rank quite low in terms of magnitude\u2014in the lowest 28% on average. Furthermore, the only study in our literature review that used both approaches (Chen et al., 2012) found that qPCR tended to produce inactivation estimates that were anywhere from 7 to 300 times lower than those produced using culture measurements. This difference could be due to a limitation in the qPCR measurements because, unlike culture methods, qPCR cannot distinguish between live and dead microbial cells. More specifically, our use of qPCR could have caused the number of live cells in effluent samples to be overestimated, thus causing us to underestimate inactivation.",

First, it seems unlikely that free DNA from dead microbes would be readily available for qPCR amplification in anaerobic digesters. The digesters are designed to promote a high level of microbial metabolism, and free DNA would likely be degraded quickly because of its value as a substrate to support that metabolism. Second, culture methods are known to have their own limitation. Specifically, bacterial culture methods tend to underestimate numbers of live cells due to the phenomenon of the viable\u2010but\u2010nonculturable (VBNC) state (Roszak and Colwell, 1987). Moreover, it is possible for numbers of culturable bacteria to decline with time in a given environment at a much faster rate than viable bacteria (Oliver, 2005). In an anaerobic digester, this could cause inactivation estimates based on culture measurements to be overestimated by a substantial degree.",

Among these, a typical exponential decay coefficient at mesophilic temperature appears to be \u223c0.2 d\u22121 (half\u2010life = 3.5 d). Calculated with a 20\u2010d residence time as before, this equates to log removal values of 0.70 for an ideal complete\u2010mix digester and 1.7 for an ideal plug\u2010flow digester. Given the large number of plug\u2010flow digesters in our study (five of seven) and the similarity of the lower value for an ideal complete\u2010mix digester to our own log removal values, we conclude that the digesters in our study are operating at a relatively inefficient level.",

However, mass balances on bovine Bacteroides and bovine polyomavirus indicated no systematic losses of either microbe in the separators that we sampled. All gene copies of each organism that entered the separators in unseparated manure, which was also processed using the direct extraction technique, were fully accounted for by summing the number of gene copies in the separated liquid and solid fractions. Furthermore, our conclusion that most microbes end up in the liquid fraction is consistent with previous studies showing that high concentrations of dissolved organic matter, such as in manure, decrease microbe attachment to solid surfaces (Guber et al., 2005), although the mechanism by which dissolved organic matter creates unfavorable attachment conditions is still debated (Bradford et al., 2013).",

Overloading is the practice of increasing a digester's flow rate beyond that which it was designed for; this is often the result of increasing herd sizes or accepting off\u2010farm feedstocks. Overloading a digester reduces its effective residence time, thereby providing less time to inactivate pathogens. Similarly, poor mixing can lead to shorter effective residence times by allowing for formation of dead zones in digesters. These dead zones can average nearly half of the total volume in full\u2010scale systems (Ontario Ministry of the Environment, 1978). Finally, poor temperature control results in many time periods during which temperatures are at less\u2010than\u2010optimum values, and these lower temperatures cause slower rates of microbe inactivation.",

Studies designed to achieve this goal would help prioritize these three factors; they might also identify other factors at the root of poor pathogen inactivation in full\u2010scale digesters. Second, field studies should investigate optimal design criteria for pathogen inactivation by relating measures of temperature control and mixing performance to inactivation over a range of loading conditions. Achieving these two goals would not only improve anaerobic digester performance with respect to pathogen inactivation, but would also likely improve performance with respect to methane production.

Our study adds data on four previously uninvestigated bovine viruses: bovine polyomavirus, bovine coronavirus, Group A rotavirus, and bovine adenovirus. However, we could only produce robust estimates of inactivation for bovine polyomavirus because the other three viruses were uncommon in manure. Laboratory experiments might be more appropriate for these uncommon bovine viruses because they would allow digester influent to be spiked with consistently high concentrations of the viruses in question.
