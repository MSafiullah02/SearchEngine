In general, most of these viruses were discovered through the diseases they cause in animals, plants, bacteria or fungi, although since the development of the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification system it has been possible to detect the presence of viruses that do not appear to cause any disease. An example of such viruses can be seen in the genus Anellovirus, which contains at least three small circular single-stranded DNA viruses that can be found in the blood of humans (Biagini et al. 2006) . These viruses are extremely widespread in the human population, with abundant anellovirus DNA being detectable in more than 80 % of human blood samples tested yet cause no clinical disease (Bendinelli & Maggi 2005) . For these reasons, any consideration of the diversity of human viruses must take into account that there has been no systematic search for human viruses that may or may not be associated with disease.",

Very few viruses are unique to the human species, and perhaps the only well known example, variola virus, has been eradicated by vaccination and now no longer exists in nature. Other potential targets for eradication, hepatitis C virus and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) seem only able infect humans and certain non-human primates, but no vaccines have been developed so far that might prevent or eliminate these infections. It is also clear that many viruses which are transmitted to humans by invertebrates, such as insects or ticks, must have the ability to infect and replicate in cells of both vertebrate and invertebrate origin. Some of these, such as the flavivirus yellow fever virus, cause extremely serious disease consequences in humans, where they target liver cells, with replication in Kupffer cells, causing massive necrosis of hepatocytes which leads to jaundice and in the worst cases severe hemorrhagic fever involving the gastrointestinal tract. These pathological features made yellow fever one of the worst plagues in history, particularly affecting the African and South American regions, and perhaps because of the disease severity, the epidemiology of The diversity of viruses infecting humans Brian W.J.

Recent finds include human bocaviruses, which now seem to have a global distribution, and cause respiratory tract disease in infants, and several new pathogenic human coronaviruses. The SARS coronavirus, genetically distinct from all previously known coronaviruses, caused a disease which was highly transmissible and very severe, eventually leading to 8000 cases worldwide with over 800 deaths. Many viruses which are transmitted to humans by invertebrates, such as insects or ticks, have the ability to infect and replicate in cells of both vertebrate and invertebrate origin. However human virology is a rapidly expanding field and recent technologies such as the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification system have made it possible to look for previously unrecognized viruses which may or may not be involved in pathogenesis. For example viruses in the genus Anellovirus are found in 80% of human blood samples yet do not seem to cause any disease. This paper overviews known human vertebrate viruses, more recent discoveries, and recommends a systematic search for viruses which may already infect the human population but have so far remained undetected. the disease was worked out and shown to involve mosquito borne transmission as early as 1900, when few viruses had been described (Reed 1902) . This led to the development of an effective attenuated yellow fever vaccine for the protection of humans. Unfortunately a satisfactory vaccine has not so far been developed for use against a related flavivirus, dengue/ dengue hemorrhagic fever virus, which occurs in four major antigenic types. But dengue fever virus, like yellow fever virus, is spread by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes, and so mosquito control methods have benefited the control of both these diseases.",

The disease first appeared in humans in China in 2002, and by 2003 had spread to a number of neighbouring countries, The first virus isolate was made from samples taken from a physician who had died from the disease in Vietnam (Drosten et al. 2003; Ksiazek et al. 2003) . The unusual feature of the SARS coronavirus was that although previously known human coronavirus infections (human coronaviruses OC43 and 229E) had long been recognized as causing relatively mild symptoms such as the common cold, genetic analysis of the SARS virus showed that it was genetically distinct from all previously known coronaviruses, and caused a disease which was highly transmissible and very severe, eventually leading to 8000 cases worldwide with over 800 deaths. The coronaviruses are currently divided into three genetic groups, with human coronavirus 229E falling into group 1 and human coronavirus OC43 into group 2. Group 3 contains only avian coronavirus species. The sequence of the SARS coronavirus placed it in group 2 (Kim et al. 2006) . Studies on the origin of the SARS coronavirus are still ongoing: there is recent evidence of a zoonotic origin of the human disease, perhaps from palm civets, but the true natural reservoir of the virus seems most likely to be in a bat species, probably Chinese horseshoe bats (Lau et al. 2005; Li et al. 2005) .",

For example, it has been known for many years that the human parvovirus, a small single-stranded DNA virus known as B19, was the cause both of a rash in children called erythema infectiosum (fifth disease), and also of aplastic crisis in both children and adults with chronic hemolytic anemia. This was the only known human parvovirus until very recently, when a new parvovirus was discovered to be the cause of lower respiratory tract infections in children. The new virus was discovered by large-scale molecular virus screening of pooled human respiratory tract samples based on host DNA depletion, random PCR amplification, large-scale sequencing analysis and bioinformatics. This procedure detected one parvovirus and one coronavirus, both of which were at that time uncharacterized (Allander et al. 2005) . The human parvovirus displayed genome nucleotide sequence similarities to known parvoviruses infecting bovine and canine animal species, bovine parvovirus and canine minute virus, which had been placed in the genus Bocavirus of the subfamily Parvovirinae within the family Parvoviridae ( Fauquet et al. 2005 ). Thus the virus was provisionally named human bocavirus.",

This virus was named human coronavirus-HKU1, since it was isolated in Hong Kong University. Further studies there showed that this virus was also associated with a second case of pneumonia, this time in a 35 year old woman, and a more complete investigation involving 4 hospitals showed that HCoV-HKU1 virus was responsible for 2.4% of all community-acquired pneumonia (Woo et al. 2005b) .

The Yale group admitted that their coronavirus was similar and might represent the same species as HCoV-NL63. However, in an accompanying paper, Esper et al. (2005b) went on to claim an association between HCoV-NH and Kawazaki disease, a childhood systemic vasculitis long suspected of having a viral origin, though none has ever been found. The importance of this claim stimulated existing Kawasaki research groups in California and in Taiwan to look for the virus in their clinical specimens, but neither group could confirm any association of either HCoV-NH or HCoV-NL63 with the disease (Shimizu et al. 2005; Chang et al. 2006 ).",

This might be based not on disease, but given our extensive data bank of virus sequences, it would be possible to carry out a systematic search for the presence of viruses in human tissues. The coronaviruses were investigated because of the intense interest in understanding SARS and its origins, but I suggest that an alternative approach might be to focus on viruses known to be important causes of disease in animals, but for which a persistent lifelong infection with no obvious pathological consequences apart from a tenfold rise in lactate dehydrogenase enzyme in the blood. But in aging mice of certain strains a form of poliomyelitis may develop. All arteriviruses, including LDV, primarily infect macrophages. The only known primate arterivirus affects monkeys, causing simian hemorrhagic fever.",
