It is estimated that the average incubation period of Covid-19 is 5.2 days, which can reach 14 days. The average period of transmission of this disease is 5 days after the onset of symptoms, however, it is believed that transmission can occur even in the absence of symptoms. On the other hand, confirmed cases, regardless of clinical presentation, are those with confirmatory laboratory tests of Covid-19[4].",

Likewise, the Brazilian Ministry of Health considers this strategy of elective surgery postponement in different centers.
