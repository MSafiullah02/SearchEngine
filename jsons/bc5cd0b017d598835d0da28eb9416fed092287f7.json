Prior research on this topic has been inconclusive. Identifying key challenges to reliable estimation of weather impact on transmission we study this question using one of the largest assembled databases of COVID-19 infections and weather. Methods: We assemble a dataset that includes virus transmission and weather data across 3,739 locations from December 12, 2019 to April 22, 2020. Using simulation, we identify key challenges to reliable estimation of weather impacts on transmission, design a statistical method to overcome these challenges, and validate it in a blinded simulation study. Using this method and controlling for location-specific response trends we estimate how different weather variables are associated with the reproduction number for COVID-19. We then use the estimates to project the relative weather-related risk of COVID-19 transmission across the world and in large cities.",

Correcting for that distributed delay and offering conservative estimates, we find a negative relationship between temperatures above 25 degrees Celsius and estimated reproduction number (\u0302), with each degree Celsius associated with a 3.1% (95% CI, 1.5% to 4.8%) reduction in \u0302. Higher levels of relative humidity strengthen the negative effect of temperature above 25 degrees. Moreover, one millibar of additional pressure increases \u0302 by approximately 0.8 percent (95% CI, 0.6% to 1%) at the median pressure (1016 millibars) in our sample. We also find significant positive effects for wind speed, precipitation, and diurnal temperature on \u0302. Sensitivity analysis and simulations show that results are robust to multiple assumptions. Despite conservative estimates, weather effects are associated with a 43% change in \u0302 between the 5 th and 95 th percentile of weather conditions in our sample.",

High-stakes policy decisions require projections of the course of the pandemic across different geographic regions. Thus, it is critical to know how weather conditions impact the transmission of the disease [1] . Given that many related viral infections such as seasonal flu [2, 3] , MERS [4] [5] [6] , and SARS [7] show notable seasonality, one may expect the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 virus to be similarly dependent on weather conditions. Earlier works indicate that temperature, humidity, air pressure, ultraviolet light exposure, and precipitation potentially impact the spread of COVID-19 through changing the survival times of the virus on surfaces and in droplets, moderating the distances the virus may travel through air, and impacting individual activity patterns and immune responses [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] .",

            "text": "It is unclear what explains the inconclusive results. Earlier samples based on datasets focused on China may be too narrow [16, 19, 24, 32] . Others have studied only a subset of weather components that complicate comparisons [18, 19, 33] . Most have not controlled for other important correlates such as government and public responses, population density, and cultural practices [15-17, 24-26, 32, 34] . Another especially under-studied factor is the delays between infection and official recording of cases. These delays, estimated to be close to 10 days [35, 36] , confound attempts to associate daily weather conditions with recorded new cases. Extending time windows over which transmission trends are calculated may partially address this challenge, but significantly reduces the number of data points, complicates interpretation and projections, and increases the risk that results are driven by spurious correlation between weather and location specific factors and trends. Therefore, lack of corrections for these delays may partially explain the inconsistent and inconclusive findings to date. This paper assembles one of the most comprehensive datasets of the global spread of COVID-19 pandemic until late April 2020, builds and validates a statistical method for the estimation of reproduction number controlling for detection delay, location-specific density, and time variant responses, estimates the association of weather conditions and the reproductive number of COVID-19, and provides year-round, global projections.",

However, early in the epidemic before the stock of susceptible populations is depleted, 0 is close to the reproduction number, , which measures the number of secondary cases from each infected case. Reproduction number can be approximated (\u0302) based on the number of new infections (IM) per currently infected individual, multiplied by the duration of illness (\u03c4) (Equation 1). Actual new infections on any day (IN) are not directly observable and should be estimated. Data on measured daily infections (IM) lags actual new infections by both the incubation period and the delay between onset of symptoms and testing and recording of a case. We use published measures to quantify the distribution of incubation period (averaged between 5 to 6 days [25, 35, 36, 39] ) and onset-to-detection delay (ranging between 4 to 6 days [35, 36] ) to quantify the overall detection delay. Given the variance in detection delay, a simple shift of measured infection by the mean delay (about 10 days) offers an unreliable estimate for true infections (See Section S3 and S5.2.2.2 in Supplementary Document). We therefore use an optimization to find the daily estimated new infections (\u0302) that are consistent with the observed measured infections (IM) and the overall detection delay distribution (See Section S3 for details).

We use a delay of \u03c4=20 days from exposure to resolution and results are robust to other durations of illness (see Section S4.1 in Supplementary Document). For each location we only include days with \u0302 values above one. \u0302 values proceed actual detection, and thus the reliability of early values for each location is affected by irregularities in early testing. Moreover, an unbiased estimate for \u0302( ) requires \u03c4 days of prior new infection estimates. Thus, to ensure robustness we separately exclude the first 20 days after the \u0302 reaches one in each location.

We found that: a) Whereas given actual infections ( ), our method, with or without fixed effects, would identify the true functional form relating temperature to transmission rate, estimates become less reliable and significantly attenuated when true infections are inferred rather than exact; b) Our method of estimating true infections (see Sections S3 and S5.2.2.2 in Supplementary Document) offers significantly better results than simple shifting of official infection counts; and c) The most reliable results in synthetic epidemics are found when location-specific trends (but not fixed effects) are used in model specification.",

With one standard deviation increase in diurnal temperature (\u2206 ), log-transformed precipitation (P), log-transformed snowfall (S) and log-transformed wind speed (W), the estimated reproduction number increases by 1.9% (95% CI: 0.6% to 3.1%), 2.9% (95% CI: 1.6% to 4.2%), 1.4% (95% CI: 0.3% to 2.5%), and 3.8% (95% CI, 2.5% to 5.1%) respectively.",

Second, our main findings are robust to excluding extreme values of the dependent variables, last few days of data, or including location fixed effects in the analysis (Table S2 in section S4.2). Third, our results are largely insensitive to different exclusion criteria for initial periods (Tables S3 and S4 in section S4.3) . Fourth, a placebo test where weather variables in each location are permuted and shifted by a random number of days shows no effect of the weather variables in most of our model specifications, adding confidence that results cannot be attributed to mechanical features of the statistical model (Table S5 in section S4.4).

With that caveat in mind, one could calculate the weather components' contribution for any vector of weather variables based on Table 1 . Exponentiating that value (as we do in Figure 1 -B) leads to a multiplicative weather score which is associated with reproduction rate independent of the location-specific characteristics and responses. Such scores are therefore comparable across locations and the ratio between two scores offers a measure of relative transmission risk for two vectors of weather variables. We define \"Relative COVID-19 Risk Due to Weather\" (CRW) as the relative predicted risk of each weather vector against the 90 th percentile of predicted risk in our estimation sample, 1.33 (Figure 1-B) .

Lauer and colleagues [2] use data from 181 cases to estimate incubation period with mean of 5.5 and median of 5.1, and offer fitted distributions using Lognormal, Gamma, Weibull, and Erlang specifications. In a supplementary graph, they also provide a figure that includes the lags from the onset of symptom to official case detection. Guan et al. [3] use data from 291 patients and estimate median incubation period of four days with interquartile range of 2 to 7 days. Linton and colleagues [4] use data from 158 cases to estimate the incubation period with a mean (standard deviation) of 5.6 (2.8) days. This delay goes down to 5 (3) when excluding Wuhan patients. They also report onset to hospital admission delay of 3.9 (3) days for living patients (155 cases). They provide their full data in an online appendix, where we calculated the onset to case report lag with mean of 5.6 days, median of 5, and standard deviation of 3.8 days. A New York Times article [5] reports that the Center for Disease Control estimates the lag between onset of symptoms to case detection to be four days. Finally, a Bayesian estimation of the detection delay using abrupt changes in national and state policies by Wibbens and colleagues find the mode of the delay to be 11 days and ranging between 5 and 20 days [6] .",

Overall, we lack a causal theory for why such an effect may exist. Moreover, as moon illumination is constant across locations in each day and exhibit cyclic behavior over each lunar month, it is possible that the moon illumination is confounded with other cyclic behavioral patterns occurring globally in our data, and thus we decided not to include it in the main analysis. Nevertheless, we reported it here to show other weather effects are robust to this additional inclusion and point to possible future avenues of investigation.",

The true exposure, the exact detection delays, and the temperature functions were hidden from our estimation method to assess the method's success objectively. Our objectives were two fold and we created a task allocation among researchers to meet those objectives: first researcher HR used the iterations of this process to improve our statistical estimation method and ensure that it was able to find temperature functions under various assumptions (Section 5.2.2); second, we used a more realistic individual-level model of infection (stochastic agent-based model) built by two other investigators (NG and MG) not involved in the first synthetic data analysis (used for method design) to assess if our statistician (RX) who was unaware of true functional forms or the new model structure could identify correct effects in this different simulation environment (section 5.3). This design addressed the risk that a method fine tuned on synthetic data may perform well under the assumed simulation setting but fail in other environments.",

This may be a serious challenge afflicting many attempts to identify the link between weather and COVID-19 transmission; 3) Our algorithm for uncovering the true exposure, and the specification we selected offer a potentially conservative but qualitatively informative view of the true underlying impacts; 4) Our preferred specification is robust to a few key uncertainties that may vary between simulated numbers and the actual epidemic; and 5) A statistician blinded to true data generating process was able to use this method to identify true weather effects from synthetic data generated from a different, more detailed, agent-based model of COVID-19 epidemics.

Removing either of the fixed effects improves the correspondence between true functional forms and actual estimates, leading to conservative but not misleading results.

First, having collected population density data, we could use those to provide some control for potential correlations between temperature and basic reproduction number due to variations in population density with climate. Second, while our W vector in simulations starts from early January, in practice the more positive trend in temperature during the spread of epidemic later in winter and early spring (when most of actual epidemic data is generated) is likely to correlate more strongly with behavioral and other responses that temper down the spread in each location. Thus, we would be worried that excluding location trends would lead regression results to pick up that spurious correlation and inflate the impact of temperature, creating illusory and misleading results. We therefore opted to focus on the more conservative estimates coming from our preferred specification. In practice, however, the inclusion or exclusion of fixed effects had limited impact on our empirical results (See Table S2 and section S4.2). This observation may suggest that our synthetic data generation process might have offered a more challenging setup for estimation than the empirical data generating process.",

To do so we use simulations to estimate how the variance in the dependent variable scales with the number of estimated daily true infections, and use that estimated variance to conduct weighted least square regressions. Results, reported in Figure S10 -panel A (panel B showing baseline replicated from experiment 1), show more bias and more dispersion compared to the unweighted regressions.

We modified the model using parameter values that are more consistent with COVID-19, and included several features needed to import and export data to the model. We modified the infection function to include the temperature effect on the probability of infection. We used three major scenarios for temperature effect (inverse u-shaped effect, linear increasing effect, and no-effect (placebo)). The scenarios included actual temperature values coming from a sample of 100 regions from the real-world data.
