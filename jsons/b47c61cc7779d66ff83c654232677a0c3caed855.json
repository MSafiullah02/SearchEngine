            "text": "All laboratories have potential hazards, and the importance of understanding lab safety cannot be emphasized strongly enough. Scientists are expected to understand and be aware of the health and safety issues associated with their profession. Regardless of the standards for laboratory safety in their country of origin and regardless of their position, all researchers require a good understanding of safety features in English before they can begin working in an English-speaking laboratory. All research institutions in English-speaking countries require all new staff to go through a safety orientation or training course before they can begin work. Your employer or institution has a legal requirement to provide you with safety training before you begin work. Generally, a safety officer, a person who acts as the institutional or departmental administrator for safety-related matters, gives the course, and a written safety test must be completed by all new employees following training before work can commence in the laboratory. It is your legal duty to cooperate with your employer or institution's efforts to improve safety in the workplace. Not respecting safety regulations and procedures while working in a laboratory does not only put your own health and others' at risk, but it may also have an impact on the lab's license and may lead to disciplinary action against you. Everyone must be aware and responsible so we can all enjoy our research while staying safe! In this chapter we aim to familiarize you with English vocabulary and symbols associated with laboratory safety and to give you some general safety guidelines. It is intended to help you address safety issues with confidence even under difficult and stressful circumstances such as emergency situations. This strong background knowledge on lab safety in English will make you more confident when you have to embark on the new experience of starting work in an Englishspeaking lab. Specific training requirements will not be discussed however, since they generally vary from country to country, between regions and localities within countries, and between institutions within localities.",

Safety goggles are different from safety glasses in that they are tight-fitting and have side shields and also provide an extra level of protection beyond safety glasses; they provide full coverage to the eyes. When safety goggles are worn correctly, they will provide protection to the eye and skin immediately surrounding the eyes from dust and splashes of liquid coming from any direction (above, below, side, or faceon). A face shield is a hard, clear plastic sheet that that covers the eyes and face completely. It generally covers the forehead, extends below the chin, and wraps around the side of face. It is intended to cover the entire face from accidental splashes of harmful liquids and some even protect against excessive exposure to ultraviolet radiation (to avoid a sunburned face). Not all face shields protect against UV; be sure that the item is specified by the manufacturer as providing protection at the wave length(s) you intend to use. The type of eye protection needed depends on the circumstances. For example, when the entire face needs protection, a face shield is used. It is important that you wear eye protection any time you are exposed to a potentially hazardous situation. For maximum protection, select the appropriate protective eyewear designed for the specific experiment you carry out and make sure you wear the appropriate eye protection throughout the entire experiment.",

            "text": "Hand protection: careful attention must be given to protecting your hands when working with potentially dangerous chemical or biological materials. Safety gloves are coverings used to protect the hands, with a separate part for each finger and thumb. Safety gloves are worn in biomedical research laboratories and animal rooms to protect the wearer from contact with damaging material. Gloves are provided by the laboratory for all its researchers. There are hundreds of different types of safety gloves. However, only a few different types of safety gloves are generally used in most biomedical research laboratories. Cryogenic gloves, heat resistant gloves, and chemical resistant gloves are the most common types found in biomedical laboratories. Cryogenic gloves are designed to provide protection to the hands from the dangers encountered when handling extremely cold items or substances, like liquid nitrogen. Liquid nitrogen can cause severe frostbites and cold burns. Gloves intended for liquid nitrogen use are generally not made to allow the hands to be put into the liquid. They only provide protection from accidental spills or contact with the liquid. These gloves are also designed to work with dry ice. Heat resistant protective gloves are designed to protect hands from intense heat and prevent heat burns. Biomedical research laboratories involved in RNA studies: glassware is often oven-baked at 200\u00b0C for at least 4 h to ensure it is free from enzymes that can degrade RNA (i.e., RNases). In order to remove glassware from these very hot ovens, one must use heat resistant gloves to protect hands from heat burns. Disposable chemical gloves are the most commonly used gloves in biomedical research laboratories and animal care facilities. These gloves may be made from latex, rubber, nitrile, polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), or polyvinyl chloride (PVC), etc. The type of chemical glove one will use should depend on the chemical being used. For example, nitrile gloves provide protection against oil based chemicals, whereas PVC gloves provide protection against aqueous chemicals. It is important to bear in mind that for chemical protection the wearer should determine the appropriate glove material to provide the desired protection. Some chemicals will rapidly penetrate some glove materials; therefore, incorrect selection or use of protective gloves can lead to chemical burns. One type of glove will not work in all situations.",
