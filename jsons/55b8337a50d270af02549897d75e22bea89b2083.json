            "text": "Epidemic viral gastroenteritis is a significant world wide problem. In developed countries, gastroenteritis accounts for significant morbidity and loss of time from work; in the Third World it is the leading cause of mortality among infants and children. Recent technologic advances have been associated with an explosion of research activity. Two virus groups, the Norwalk-like agents and the rotaviruses, are currently accepted as causative agents of viral gastroenteritis in man. The problem of viral gastroenteritis is reviewed both from a current and a historic perspective. Viral gastroenteritis, more correctly termed acute enteritis or enteropathy, is a common cause of illness in man. In the United States, the illness is usually not of significant severity or duration to cause the patient to seek medical attention. Therefore, even widespread outbreaks remain unrecognized unless they are brought to the attention of the health authorities because of the large number of people involved. Viral gastroenteritis is a more significant problem in underdeveloped countries; estimates are that it is responsible for more than 500 million episodes of diarrhea and 5 to 18 million deaths annually [Il.",

Many studies have consisted simply of screening stool specimens of diarrhea1 patients for viral agents; the frequency of positive cultures may or may not have been compared with results obtained in a control population. Such studies have accumulated data to foster epidemiologic hypotheses which require further testing; they have not provided definite evidence of causation. Current knowledge of the viral stool-shedding patterns is rudimentary. For example, in a recent study virus excretions in the stools of 27 babies were followed for one year [2] . The study revealed that babies frequently shed viruses and that the viral excretion patterns change rapidly. Fifteen per cent of the stools from healthy babies contained viruses, including rotaviruses, adenoviruses, astroviruses, caliciviruses and small unidentified viruses. During hospitalization, the proportion of infants who excreted viruses increased to 44 per cent, with many of the viruses appearing to be hospital-acquired. This study emphasized the current problems in interpreting data from studies of fecal viral excretion, including the need for concurrent strict control populations.",

            "text": "With these problems in mind, one can critically evaluate previous studies and carefully plan future studies to differentiate between diarrheal-associated viruses and proved enteritis-inducing agents. Proof of causation of infectious disease was codified by Robert Koch in 1890 [3]. Koch's postulates stated that an organism must be regularly isolated from patients with the illness and in a logical relationship to the pathologic changes observed. The isolated organism should be grown in pure culture and shown to be capable of causing the same illness in susceptible animals or human subjects. Finally, the organism should be reisolated from the subject with the experimentallyinduced disease. Noting that many viruses cannot be cultured, Thomas Rivers [4] and later Robert Huebner [5] proposed modifications of Koch's postulates that would allow proof of causation of viral illnesses. They suggested that for viral diseases the specific virus must be regularly associated with the disease, that the illness must be transmissible to susceptible hosts from material known to be free from nonviral agents, and that control and immunologic studies be carried out to exclude that the virus was fortuitously present or picked up from the experimental host. Supporting immunologic critera are also important, including evidence that specific viral antibody is absent before infection and that it is produced by the infection; the absence or presence of antibody should correlate with disease susceptibility and protection, respectively. Of the many viruses identified in stools, only two groups have met the criteria as definite etiologic agents of epidemic gastroenteritis in human subjects: rotaviruses and the small 27 nm agents [Norwalk-like agents) ( of investigations which began with an epidemic of gastroenteritis occurring in the newborn in the Baltimore-Washington area in the fall of 1941. They were able to obtain multiple passages of the infectious agent (the Baltimore agent) by administering filtered stool to calves. Calves were found to be uniformly susceptible with an incubation period of two to five days. The illness in calves had a mortality rate of 13 per cent, and infection was followed by homologous immunity. Horizontal infection was evident, and strict isolation procedures were employed. The Baltimore agent is the only isolate from the early studies that was saved, and recent characterizations revealed that it is probably a rotavirus [71.",

Advances in knowledge and methodology for the detection of fastidious and noncultivatable viral agents in the 1960s led to a renewal of interest in gastroenteritis viruses in the 1970s. The application of immune electron microscopy, the technique used to identify hepatitis A virus particles in stools, to diarrhea1 samples brought about the successful identification of two enteritis viruses in human subjects. The recent development of rapid and very sensitive tests (radioimmunoassay, immune adherence hemagglutination and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays) which can detect symptomatic and asymptomatic infections should quickly expand our knowledge of the natural history and epidemiology of these diseases. The history of investigations in viral gastroenteritis is a good example of the fact that major scientific advances often require and parallel new technologic opportunities. 27 nm Particles (Norwalk-Like Agents). On October 30,1968, an attack of viral gastroenteritis occurred in an elementary school in Norwalk, Ohio [13] . In this attack, 50 per cent of the teachers and students were affected within a 24-hour period with an illness characterized by nausea, vomiting and abdominal cramps. The symptoms lasted from 12 to 24 hours. No patient required hospitalization, and recovery was complete. Because of the suddenness of the attack and the large number of persons involved, Public Health authorities including the Center for Disease Control were asked to investigate the outbreak. No evidence of food or water spread was found. No pathogenic bacteria were discovered, and the symptomatic characteristics of the illness were different from common bacterial diarrheas.",

Stool filtrates were characterized as being free from bacteria, fungi, bacteriophages and enterotoxin. Although no viral agent could be propagated in a variety of tissue culture systems or in laboratory animals [including primates), the studies in volunteer subjects demonstrated that the infectious agent would pass through a 60 pm filter but that it was retained by a 20 Frn filter. It was also heat stable, resistant to ether and acid treatments, and produced ho-mologous immunity following infection [15] . Subsequently, the agent was propagated briefly in culture of material from intestinal organs [16] and in 1972 Kapikian and co-workers [l7] succeeded in identifying a 27 nm particle by immune electron microscopy of stools from infected volunteer subjects. In 1973, two groups described histologic studies of small bowel mucosa in volunteer subjects infected with the agent [18, 19] . Histologic changes included abnormalities in the mucosal absorptive cells, mucosal inflammation, villus shortening and secondary crypt hypertrophy. In addition, there were decreases in specific activities of intestinal brush border enzymes. These changes were associated with malabsorption of the carbohydrates, D-xylose and lactose, and transient steatorrhea. The histologic findings became apparent several hours prior to the onset of symptoms and persisted for several days. Histologic abnormalities were also found in patients without symptoms, but severe lesions tended to be associated with the severe illnesses. Two other Norwalk-like agents have been obtained in outbreaks of gastroenteritis: the H agent in Honolulu in March 1971 and the MC agent, in an attack in Montgomery County, Maryland, in June 1971. Studies in volunteer subjects suggested that the Norwalk and Hawaii agents were antigenically dissimilar, whereas the Norwalk agent conferred immunity to challenge with the MC agent [zo] .",

This same year Flewett and associates [29] in England described similar viral particles in diarrhea1 feces. It was soon recognized that the particles are morphologically similar to the epizootic diarrhea virus of infant mice and to the Nebraska calf diarrhea virus [30] . Rotaviruses are a major cause of diarrhea1 illnesses in young mammals of a wide variety of species.",

The derivation of that terminology is based on the electron microscopic appearance of a wheel with radiating spokes. Rotaviruses have been established as enteritis viruses by isolation and purification from stools of subjects suffering from gastroenteritis, and by induction of disease and seroconversion in both animals and volunteer subjects with purified preparations, Epidemiologic studies on the prevalence of rotavirus infections have shown these ubiquitous agents to be a major cause of gastroenteritis in children. In a typical study, Davidson et al. [31] found that 52 per cent of the cases of acute gastroenteritis in 378 children hospitalized in Australia were caused by rotavirus. An etiologic agent was identified in 76 per cent of these cases, and the remaining causes were shigella 1 per cent, Escherichia coli 2 per cent, enterovirus 2 per cent, adenovirus 7 per cent and salmonella 11 per cent. Similar findings have been repeated the world over. Rotavirus infections usually predominate during the winter season with an incubation period of two to four days. Symptomatic infections are most common in children aged six months to six years, and transmission of rotavirus gastroenteritis appears tb be by the fecal-oral route.",

The general pattern of infection involves virus penetration and infection of the differentiated enterocytes in the villi of the small intestine [58] . Rotaviruses multiply in the cytoplasm of these cells and damage the absorptive cells, resulting in damage to both the digestive and the absorptive functions. Available evidence suggests that such damaged cells are sloughed into the small intestine; lysis of the infected cells releases the virus into the intestine, resulting in the large quantities of virus detected in stools of infected subjects. These studies suggest that the diarrhea caused by rotavirus infection is due to malabsorption which also includes impaired glucose-sodium absorption. The highly differentiated absorptive villous cells are replaced by immature crypt cells that are not able to immediately compensate for the absorptive defect [59] . Treatment of Viral Gastroenteritis. Treatment of viral gastroenteritis is supportive. Death is associated with loss of electrolytes and water, leading to dehydration, acidosis and shock; it is not due to an irreversible effect of the causative agent. Due to the damage to the intestinal digestive and absorptive functions, initial therapy should include withdrawal of milk or lactose-containing products, Dehydration should be combatted with the oral replacement of fluids and electrolytes. Recent studies have suggested that oral therapy, using sugar and electrolyte solutions, is as effective as intravenous therapy in most infants and children.",

This is an important observation since sucrose is less expensive and more readily available than glucose, particularly in developing countries in which the mortality from rotavirus infection is a significant problem. In addition, it appeared that oral glucose-electrolyte solutions are effective therapy for diarrhea1 disease of both bacterial and viral etiology. Although limited knowledge exists, widely administered antidiarrheal agents, such as kaolin-pectin or LomotiP, do not appear to be useful in the relief of viral diarrhea in children [62] . Areas for Further Research. Despite the tremendous amount of investigative work carried out in viral gastroenteritis, an understanding of the natural history and epidemiology of this disease is still lacking. Both rotaviruses and the Norwalk-like viral agents have been established as etiologic agents in some cases of viral gastroenteritis. The role and clinical significance of other viral agents that have been associated with diarrhea in man, including adenoviruses, enteroviruses, astroviruses, coronaviruses and caliciviruses, remain to be elucidated. The inability to cultivate rotaviruses and Norwalk-like viruses from human subjects has hampered progress in elucidating the natural history, virology and epidemiology of these illnesses. To date, no small animal model has been identified which would permit the study of the replication of these viruses in vivo.",

Four strains of rotavirus from human subjects and at least two strains of Norwalk-like viruses have been reported; future studies need to determine the clinical significance of these strain differences. It remains to be established whether avirulent as well as virulent strains exist, whether defective strains are produced and whether recombinant viruses occur. Recombinant viruses are a particular possibility if one considers that the segmented RNA genomes of the rotaviruses are similar to those of the influenza viruses.",

It has been demonstrated that rotaviruses can establish persistent infections in cell culture [63] , but the control mechanisms responsible for chronic infections in animals and/or cell lines have yet to be unraveled. Lastly, the hosts and reservoirs of these viruses remain to be established. Unfortunately, possible cross-species infections and the lack of reliable sensitive methods to detect rotavirus strain differences do not make these goals easily attainable. Finally, the possible role of these viral agents in the establishment and maintenance of chronic diarrhea1 disease warrants further investigation, both with respect to chronic diarrhea of childhood and the relationship to inflammatory bowel disease. Although prevention of gastroenteritis by vaccination is suggested in many publications, the primitive state of our knowledge of gastroenteritis viruses makes such discussions truly academic at the present time.",
