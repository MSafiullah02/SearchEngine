            "text": "The frailty phenotype was described by the Cardiovascular Health Study Collaborative Research Group in older adults as a complex syndrome resulting from cumulative declines across multiple physiologic systems and leading to decreased resistance to stressors [1]. Fried et al. quantified frailty as a score based upon measurements in five domains: (1) slowness, (2) weakness, (3) self-reported exhaustion, (4) shrinkage (body composition) and (5) low physical activity. In the elderly, the frailty score has been validated as an objective assessment of overall health in chronic disease states; higher frailty scores have been associated with adverse health outcomes [1] and mortality [2], including peri-procedural mortality [3, 4]. Recent studies have suggested that frailty as a physiological phenotype may exist beyond the geriatric population. A multi-institutional study in young adult survivors of childhood cancer demonstrated that the prevalence of frailty in this population is 7.8%; with higher frailty scores associated with an increased risk of morbidity and mortality [5]. A recent multicenter study compared frailty measures in children with compensated chronic liver disease to those with end-stage liver disease and found this tool to be useful in identifying the sickest individuals [6]. However, frailty has not been studied in children and adolescents with cardiac disease (CCD).",

All patients with heart failure were classified as AHA stage B or C and were asymptomatic at the time of enrollment. We excluded participants who were wheelchair bound, tracheostomy and/or ventilator-dependent, or had significant physical limitations that could affect their ability to complete testing. Participants who were NYHA class IV, heart failure post heart transplantation within the past 1 year or Fontan surgery within the past 6 months were also excluded. Control participants (n = 22), with no known chronic medical conditions, were age and sex matched to the participants in the CCD group. We excluded controls who took any prescription medications in the past 30 days. Participants were recruited by posting flyers in the cardiology clinic at our hospital and through the hospital\u2019s internal electronic newsletter. Detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria are shown in Table 1. The study protocol was approved by the Children\u2019s Mercy Hospital Institutional Review Board-16060468.

The researchers used population data to define slowness as the slowest 20% of the population [1]. Unlike the adult population, the 15 ft. walk test does not have published normative values in children and adolescents. Hence, it would be difficult to compare the results of this test between an 8 year old and a 15 year old who have markedly different stride lengths. Similar to other studies measuring frailty in youth [6], we elected to use the 6-min walk test as our measure of slowness, as it has published age and sex-based reference values for the pediatric population [14]. We provided participants with a measuring wheel with handle adjusted for their height. We asked them to walk back and forth along a 30-m path in a low traffic hallway for six continuous minutes. They were permitted to self-regulate their walking speed without jogging or running and were allowed to stop at any time to rest or lean against a wall, but not allowed to sit unless they requested that the test be terminated. We used standard 6MWT reference values for children and adolescents [14] to generate Z scores.",

The MAQ-A is an interviewer-administered questionnaire that asks participants to report household and recreational forms of physical activity over the past year. We used this information to calculate the average number of hours per week (hr/wk) of physical activity over the past year [28, 29]. We objectively measured physical activity with an ActiGraph wGT3X-BT accelerometer (ActiGraph LLC, Pensacola, FL) worn on an elastic belt over the non-dominant hip for seven consecutive days. Three days with \u2265 10 h/day of wear time was required for inclusion. The device was programmed to store data at 1-min epochs. Mean accelerations per minute were analyzed using the ActiLife 6 Single software and classified using the Evenson cut-points for moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity, MVPA [30]. MVPA in min/day were compared to estimates of physical activity from the PAQ-C or A and the MAQ-A to determine which subjective measure of physical activity was most accurate.",

At present, there is no clear consensus on parameters that can help to identify patients at highest risk of adverse health outcomes such as hospitalization or mortality. The current standard of medical care consists of periodic ambulatory clinic visits with testing including echocardiography, exercise testing, and monitoring for arrhythmia. While these tests provide useful information about cardiac function, they neither correlate with overall debility; nor do they adequately predict risk of future adverse events [36\u201339]. Knowing that debilitating morbidities are not limited to only specific cardiac conditions, the intention of this study was to develop a broad based, generalizable clinical measure of infirmity for children and adolescents with cardiac disease.

[1] was a population-based score in the elderly that were not hospitalized or end stage, and helped identify individuals at the highest risk of mortality. A high frailty score was associated in this study with increased risk of mortality and adverse outcomes. Since the original publication, the frailty score has been extensively studied in adults and has been found to be associated with adverse outcomes in a heterogeneous array of medical conditions such as liver [40] and renal disease [41], post-operative patients [4, 42, 43] and in heart failure [44]. If such a score could be designed and validated in the CCD population, it could be immensely helpful in identifying the patients that are most at risk for deterioration, so that more aggressive medical and supportive therapy could be targeted towards them. The concept could be extended to other chronic disease states in children as well. The frailty score has the advantage of being internationally recognized [45] and widely tested by clinicians in adult literature. We thus sought to adapt the domains of frailty to the pediatric population by using age appropriate techniques that have been well studied over the years and have normal age and gender specific reference values available [14, 15, 22\u201324].",

In this multicenter study, they recruited 36 children with compensated liver disease and 35 with end-stage liver disease. They found worse frailty scores in those children with end-stage liver disease when compared to controls with compensated chronic liver disease; a frailty score of > 5 had the best sensitivity and specificity in identifying children with end-stage liver disease. Similar to our study, the investigators used standard, developmentally appropriate and validated tools to assess the frailty domains, such as grip strength by hand dynamometer, 6MWT, triceps skinfold thickness, PedsQL 4.0 Multidimensional Fatigue scale and the modified PAQ. In our study, we used multiple measures for some of the domains as we have previously described; this is because it is yet unclear which measures could be of most value in generating a future pediatric frailty score. For example, considering subjective reports of physical activity may be skewed by perception and memory recall, we compared two different validated physical activity questionnaires to physical activity measured objectively via accelerometer. Similar to the study by Voss et al. [46], we found the PAQ for children or adolescents was an accurate subjective measure of physical activity in this population.",

One of the key drivers of the frail state in the elderly is chronic undernutrition and loss of lean body mass leading to negative nitrogen balance. Our CCD cohort had lower anthropometric measures and triceps fold thickness compared to controls, though mid arm circumference was similar. A recent study done in patients with Fontan physiology showed that lower height percentiles were associated with worse functional outcomes [47]. However, since congenital heart disease could be associated with genetic short stature, assessment of height may be a confounding variable. Measurement of triceps skinfold thickness should be considered in assessing CCD as it is less affected by other factors such as genetic or chromosomal anomalies. It seems unlikely that children with cardiac disease would lose weight unless severely ill and incapacitated. Therefore, overall somatic growth, or a serial decrease in percentile measurements may be more relevant than weight loss in this population.",

A study in adults with congenital heart disease (mean age 33 \u00b1 13 years) demonstrated markedly impaired peak oxygen consumption even in participants in NYHA class I as compared to healthy controls [48]. The authors concluded that NYHA class underestimated the true degree of exercise limitation. Lurz et al. noted that the frailty scores in children with chronic liver disease did not correlate with physicians\u2019 subjective assessments or commonly used objective scores to assess extent of liver disease [6]. Hence, NYHA classification and physicians\u2019 subjective assessments may have limitations that the frailty score, as an objectively measured score may be able to overcome. We did not find a difference within the CCD group for the different NYHA classes; this is likely because the study was underpowered to detect differences within subgroups.",

Pin Ng et al. looked at the effect of nutritional, physical rehabilitation and cognitive training in frail adults and found that these interventions could improve the frailty score over 12 months; however, there was no difference in secondary outcomes such as hospitalizations or mortality, likely due to the study being underpowered to assess those outcomes [49]. Monteserin et al. in a larger study of 620 participants, found that a higher percentage of participants reversed their frailty risk after receiving interventions aimed at health promotion as compared to controls receiving usual care [50]. Studies in pediatric Fontan patients have shown improvement in cardiac output and quality of life following endurance training, suggesting potential benefits of interventions even in children [51, 52]. It is conceivable that identification of the frailty phenotype in children could be beneficial in identifying those individuals at risk and designing specific interventions to potentially reverse their risk for adverse health outcomes. The frailty measures do take time to administer, especially in a busy clinic practice.",

Because of the small sample size and lack of longitudinal follow-up, this study is a first step towards the creation of a frailty score in CCD. The performance of our healthy controls on the 6MWT was below the published population norms. This could potentially be from the methodology used, wherein we had participants walk back and forth across a small hallway and they may have lost time in turning around thereby affecting the total distance covered. Although we cannot be entirely sure, it is also possible that the control participants performed at a level lower than expected for the 6MWT due to lack of motivation to complete the test to the best of their ability despite encouragement. While none of the Fontan participants had activity restrictions imposed by their cardiologist, it is not possible to exclude self-restriction by the patient or family due to anxiety surrounding their cardiac diagnosis, which could have affected the scores on the activity questionnaires and accelerometer.",
