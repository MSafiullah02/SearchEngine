In developed countries infections of the upper and lower respiratory tract are important causes of disability and days lost from school or work. Early identification of the organism responsible for outbreaks of respiratory infection is important to facilitate distribution of specific drugs if appropriate, and provide reliable public health information. Investigation of community outbreaks of respiratory illness is often hampered by inability to culture the organism. However, the use of molecular techniques directly on respiratory samples facilitates the investigation of respiratory outbreaks and can provide rapid identification of an organism and its relationship to current vaccines, as we show here for an outbreak of influenza virus in England in 1995.",

            "text": "Influenza virus is a major cause of upper respiratory tract infection in young adults. Influenza A & B viruses undergo gradual antigenic variation resulting from point mutations in the surface antigens of the virus (haemagglutinin [HA] and neuramindase). These antigenic changes allow evasion of the host immune response and the accumulation of mutations means that the influenza vaccine components require updating at regular intervals. Continual surveillance of circulating viruses is essential to ensure a good match between vaccine and prevailing strains. The 1994/1995 epidemic in the UK was caused predominantly by influenza B viruses [1] . Influenza A H3N2 viruses were first isolated in mid February in 1995 in England. Between February and September 1995 43 influenza A H3N2 isolates were identified. These were antigenically closely related to the H3N2 vaccine strain for 1995/1996, A/Johannesburg/33/94 e.g. A/England/282/95 (Table 1 ). Sequence analysis of the HA1 portion of haemagglutinin gene of 12 of 43 influenza H3N2 isolates using previously described methods [2] , indicated that there were two major sequence variants distinguished by eleven or more amino acid changes, which could be grouped by their relatedness to reference strains, either A/Johannesburg/33/94 (Group I) or A/Thessaloniki/ 1/95 (Group II) ( Figure 1 ). These variants were however, antigenically very closely related e.g. A/England/282 and A/England/286/96 (Table 1 ). There were approximately equal numbers in each group in England between February and September 1995, and there was no obvious correlation between sequence group and geographical location. Clearly, therefore, in England during spring and summer 1995 there was co-circulation of two different variants of influenza A H3N2 which were antigenically similar but genetically distinct.",

A further six boys with respiratory illness also had nasopharyngeal aspirates taken during the outbreak which were analysed in a similar way.

In this outbreak of respiratory illness in a boarding school in the South of England in autumn 1995 we have evidence of the simultaneous introduction of two distinct variants of influenza virus A H3N2 along with co-circulation of a rhino- Haemagglutination inhibition using post infection ferret antisera treated with receptor destroying enzyme. HI tests were carried out using 8 HA units of virus and 0.5% v/v turkey red blood cells. A virus which shows a four fold or less reactivity with earlier antigens or antisera or both is considered to show significant antigenic drift. virus. This highlights the problems of public health surveillance of influenza where most cases of 'flu like illness' are not investigated virologically and many viruses, e.g., respiratory syncytial virus, rhino-viruses or coronaviruses can cause a similar syndrome. It is clear from the fact that two influenza virus variants were isolated from different individuals on day 1 of the outbreak that there cannot have been a single index case for the outbreak in this school. It is probable that two or more children returning to boarding school from different areas of the country introduced the two variants of influenza into the boarding school community. The A/Johannesburg/33/94 like strains were not reflected in the isolates from the local area of the school (Figure 2b ). As only a limited number of respira-tory samples were taken from the total affected population it is not possible to comment on the overall distribution of A/Johannesburg/33/94 to A/Thessaloniki/1/95 like influenza viruses circulating within the school during the period of the outbreak. This report is the first demonstration of the use of RT-PCR restriction analysis in the investigation of an outbreak of influenza. Although RT-PCR restriction digestion has been described for the analysis of candidate influenza vaccine strains the technique has not been applied directly to respiratory secretions [4] , nor indeed has it been widely used to analyse genetic diversity of respiratory viruses. RT-PCR restriction analysis directly on respiratory material provides a method for rapid genetic analysis, with a minimum of material, in absence of cultured virus. Furthermore, RT-PCR restriction is a technique which can be applied easily to a relatively large number of samples. However, investigation of the antigenicity of the viruses requires isolation and further serological characterisation which remains invaluable in assessing the importance of genetic drift in influenza. Further investigations of this nature have the potential to dissect respiratory outbreaks and provide information on genetic diversity and molecular evolution of strains in closed populations. ",
