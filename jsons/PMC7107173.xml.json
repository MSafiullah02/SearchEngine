            "text": "Enteric diseases are of paramount importance to the national and global poultry industry (Jindal et al., 2012). Runting-Stunting Syndrome (RSS) is an enteric syndrome with mild clinical signs, such as diarrhea, that causes flocks to mature in a non-uniform pattern, which causes the body weights at slaughter to differ broadly (Otto et al., 2006). Olsen first reported RSS in the broiler industry in 1977 (Olsen, 1977). This syndrome is a transmissible disease of uncertain etiology that affects chickens early in life (Goodwin et al., 1993; Kang et al., 2012b). Enteric viruses, such as CAstV, ChPV, ANV, ARtV, AReoV, and FAdV-1 are related and have been detected in chickens with signs of RSS (Day et al., 2007; Pantin-Jackwood et al., 2008; Pantin-Jackwood et al., 2011; Mettifogo et al., 2014). However, CAstV is recognised as the causal agent of enteritis in chickens, primarily young chicks, and it has been detected in one-day-old chicks (Pantin-Jackwood et al., 2008; Mettifogo et al., 2014). There are actually 2 astroviruses in chickens that are genetically characterised as ANV and CAstV (Imada et al., 2000; Baxendale and Mebatsion, 2004; Todd et al., 2009a). Astroviruses are small, spherical viruses that are 25 to 35 nm in diameter and possess single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genomes approximately 7 kb in length. The genome encodes for 3 proteins: the non-structural (NS) polyprotein, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), and the capsid protein. The NS polyprotein and capsid protein are encoded by individual open-reading frames (ORF), ORF1a and ORF2, and RdRP (ORF 1b) acts as a fusion protein to the NS protein (Kang et al., 2012a). The genome begins with a 5\u2032 untranslated region (UTR), followed by the 3 ORFs, a 3\u2032 UTR, and a poly A tail (Koci and Schultz-Cherry, 2002; Nu\u00f1ez and Piantino Ferreira, 2013a). ORF1a encodes the viral protease and is followed by ORF1b, which encodes the RNA polymerase (RdRp). ORF2 encodes the precursor of the capsid protein, and it is located downstream of ORF1b and prior to the untranslated region of the genome (Kang et al., 2012a). An experimental infection with CAstV in one-day-old chickens showed mild diarrhea and distension of the small intestine (De Wit et al., 2011). Clinical signs, including diarrhea, decreased food consumption, and nervousness, developed between one and 3 wk of age (Moser and Schultz-Cherry, 2005). CAstV has been detected in the United Kingdom, United States, Korea, India, Netherlands, Croatia (Day et al., 2007; Pantin-Jackwood et al., 2007; Todd et al., 2009a,b; Smyth et al., 2010; Kang et al., 2012b; Koo et al., 2013). And, more recently, in Brazil (Mettifogo et al., 2014), which demonstrates a worldwide distribution (De Benedictis et al., 2011). Most of the CAstV reported worldwide was detected in chickens with enteric disease. However, more recent reports have indicated an association of CAstV with a low hatching rate, weakness, and white plumage, which is characterised as an abnormal condition termed white chicks (Smyth et al., 2013).",

PCR amplification was performed under the following conditions: a cycle of 94\u00b0C for 3 min to completely denature the cDNA; 30 cycles of a denaturation temperature at 94\u00b0C for one min; hybridisation of primers at 56\u00b0C for one min; extension at 72\u00b0C for one min; and a final incubation at 72\u00b0C for 10 min. The reaction was maintained at 4\u00b0C for an undetermined period until storage at 20\u00b0C. RT-PCR for CAstV amplification was performed using similar protocols as Day et al. (2007) (Table 2). Chicks with the unusual condition white chicks were tested for other enteric viruses. PCR for ChPV was performed according to Zsak et al. (2009). PCR for FAdV-1 was performed according to Meulemans et al. (2001). RT-PCR for ANV and avian rotavirus was also performed according to Day et al. (2007). RT-PCR/NESTED for IBV was performed according to Cavanagh et al. (2002), and RT-PCR for reovirus was performed according to Pantin-Jackwood et al. (2008). Table 2 describes the primer sequences used. The amplified products (362-bp CAstV, 473-bp ANV, 179-bp IBV, 630-bp ARtV, 1120-bp AReoV, 561-bp ChPV, and 897-bp FAdV-1) were submitted to electrophoresis in a 1.5% agarose gel. The samples were stained with Sybr Safe (Invitrogen by Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) and compared with a 100-bp molecular ladder (Invitrogen by Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). The results were analyzed on a transilluminator and photographed using an Alpha Imager Mini Analysis System (Alpha Innotech by Protein Symple, Santa Clara, CA).",

The present work demonstrates that CAstV was distributed in several organs, principally in the digestive tract, gizzard, and intestine. However, there were fewer proventriculus positive samples. CAstV also was detected in the yolk sac remnant, which suggests that the virus originated there and began to develop in the intestine with continuous propagation in the gizzard. The virus may subsequently move to the proventriculus. However, difficulty in the isolation of CAstV hinders our understanding of the path that the virus uses for propagation in the embryonic organism (Nu\u00f1ez et al., 2015c). Further, CAstV was described in the accessory glands, such as the pancreas and liver, and in the lymphoid organs, such as the thymus, bursa, and spleen. However, few liver samples were positive for CAstV, which contrasts a Smyth et al. (2013) report in which the liver exhibited more prevalence for CAstV. Moreover, in the present work, CAstV was detected in the brain of analyzed chicks. To the authors\u2019 knowledge, there are no reports of CAstV in the brains of chickens. These results suggest that the viremia may reach several organs, including the brain.",

Molecular tests were developed subsequently to detect CAstV with more accuracy (Pantin-Jackwood et al., 2006; Day et al., 2007; Smyth et al., 2009; Pantin-Jackwood et al., 2011). RT-PCR amplified a specific region of the ORF 1b gene of the CAstV genome in the present work (Day et al., 2007). The sequences obtained here from our chickens with the condition of white chicks showed a high similarity of nucleotides and amino acids with sequences from several parts of the world, which demonstrates that the CAstV related with white chicks in Brazilian flocks is molecularly related with other CAstV. However, the Brazilian CAstV was grouped into a separate cluster. Different molecular analyses showed that CAstV was classified into several groups: group A principally included sequences of the United Kingdom, and group B (Smyth et al., 2012) formed two subgroups, Bi and Bii. The sequences obtained in the present work were grouped into a unique group, and the other sequences were grouped with isolates from India that belonged to Subgroup Bi (Bulbule et al., 2013). However, a high similarity of nt and aa were shared with the Brazilian sequences, which suggests that the sequences obtained here may also belong to the Subgroup Bi. Moreover, the sequences obtained here were compared with sequences from groups A and Bii according to Bulbule et al. (2013), and the results showed a low similarity of nt and aa (data not shown). More studies must be performed to understand the molecular features of CAstV that are related to white chicks and determine whether the complete genome of this virus is completely related to the viruses detected in chickens with enteric diseases to determine its importance in the occurrence of enteric diseases.",

Experimental infection with CAstV associated with gout in specific pathogen-free (SPF) chicken embryos also resulted in the stunting of embryos, necrosis of the liver, and pale and swollen kidneys (Bulbule et al., 2013).

Carotenoid pigments are common colorants of egg yolk, feathers, and bare parts (such as the beak and legs) in birds. Carotenoids are supplied in the diet, and they are usually absorbed in different sections of the intestine, principally the ileum. The absorption of lutein occurs in the duodenum and jejunum (Tyczkowski and Hamilton, 1986). White chicks exhibit a white plumage at hatching, from which the name was derived. Hypothetically, this unusual white plumage pigmentation may be due to a lack of carotenoid accumulation and a decrease in carotenoid (lutein) absorption provoked by CAstV replication in the intestinal mucosa.",

            "text": "Enteric diseases are a very significant health problem in the poultry industry. Over the last several years, several outbreaks of enteric diseases were reported in some states of Brazil, including primary agents, such as CAstV, ChPV, FAdV-1, ARtV, and AReoV (Mettifogo et al., 2014). A compromised enteric tract is a concern for the poultry industry because of the low performance, high production costs, and increase in the use of therapeutic drugs that are required to reduce the impact of associated pathogens.",
