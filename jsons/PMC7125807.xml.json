Studies using serology and viral culture identified respiratory viruses in 30% of patients during acute exacerbations of COPD.4 With the development of more sensitive molecular tests the role of viruses in COPD has been better defined. Walsh et al. identified several common respiratory viruses in a cohort of patients with COPD or congestive cardiac failure.5 Viruses were identified by serology and viral culture methods. Significant outcomes in terms of hospitalisation were seen for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and influenza A infected patients. Greenberg et al., using serology and viral culture, showed that in 23% of cases of hospitalisation of COPD patients a virus was detected and that the mean time to return to symptomatic baseline was 2 weeks.6 The most common viruses identified were of the picornavirus classification (rhinoviruses).",

Initially, in 2000 Seemungal et al. examined 33 patients with COPD when stable and subsequently during an exacerbation.7 Ten of 43 exacerbations were associated with rhinovirus infection. Higher symptom scores and sputum interleukin-6 levels were seen with rhinovirus exacerbations. Seemungal et al. went on to show respiratory viral infection in 39% of exacerbations of COPD.8 Viral infection was associated with a more severe exacerbation, and in patients who had a higher frequency of exacerbations, i.e. those with the poorest lung function. Patients were reviewed in convalescence at 4\u20136 weeks. The majority (58%) of these viruses were rhinovirus (i.e. 23% of COPD exacerbations). Plasma IL-6 levels were elevated in all exacerbations, and levels were significantly increased in the virus positive group when comparison was made with those in whom no virus was detected.",

These episodes may be related to the progressive nature of this disease process rather than an acute event. Thus the true role of respiratory viral infection in exacerbations may be under-estimated. A possible area of bias was that all patients recruited were hospitalized. Thus selection bias may have been imposed in that those patients admitted to hospital tended to have particular types of respiratory viral infection or that respiratory viral infection only precipitated an exacerbation and subsequent hospital admission in patients with severe COPD. Another potential source of bias is the seasonality of respiratory viral infection. We addressed this issue by recruiting patients during all months of the year over a 2-year period. Other potential sources of bias include patient selection; those patients most ill and requiring non-invasive ventilation were too ill to participate in the study.",
