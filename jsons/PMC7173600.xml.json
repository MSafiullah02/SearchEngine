            "text": "Diarrheal illnesses of humans have been documented since the dawn of history. In spite of the discovery during the past century of numerous enteric bacteria and parasites, the etiology of a major portion of diarrheal illnesses remained unknown until the 1970s. It was assumed by exclusion that viruses were responsible for a significant portion of these illnesses. Thus, volunteer studies were initiated in the 1940s and 1950s because most viruses could not be propagated in vitro or in an animal model. These studies attempted to determine if illness could be induced with a presumptive nonbacterial viral agent by feeding bacteria-free fecal filtrates, derived from adults with acute nonbacterial gastroenteritis, to adult volunteers. Illness was induced demonstrating that the nonbacterial suspensions were indeed etiologic agents of acute gastroenteritis. The filtrates were named after the source of the original specimen, e.g. Marcy (Marcy State Hospital, Utica, New York), Niigata (Niigata Prefecture, Japan) and FS (Family Study, Cleveland, Ohio). These agents were passaged serially to other volunteers and also characterized antigenically in crosschallenge studies. However, because none of the infectious agents could be identified further in vitro or in an animal model, the etiology of acute nonbacterial gastroenteritis remained elusive. In the 1950s and 1960s, the introduction of tissue culture technology led to the discovery of over 100 new viruses, many of which were isolated in feces, but none of these new viruses could be implicated as an important etiologic agent of acute gastroenteritis. In the late 1960s, human embryonic organ cultures of the respiratory tract were used to successfully isolate several fastidious respiratory coronaviruses. Prompted by this success, renewed efforts were made to isolate viruses from fecal specimens of patients with viral gastroenteritis by utilizing human embryonic intestinal organ culture; these studies failed to identify an etiologic agent. It was considered that perhaps the lack of success was due to the absence of an infectious agent in the fecal specimen used as inoculum. Fecal suspensions prepared in the 1940s and 1950s, as described above, that were known to be infectious in challenge studies were either exhausted or not available at that time for evaluation with these newer techniques. Thus, in the early 1970s, a \u2018second generation\u2019 of volunteer studies was initiated. In one of these, a filtrate made from a rectal swab specimen from a secondary case of gastroenteritis from an outbreak of \u2018winter vomiting disease\u2019 that affected about 50% of the students and teachers in an elementary school in Norwalk, Ohio, was found to induce gastroenteritis in adult volunteers. This illness-inducing filtrate was serially passaged to other volunteers and was designated as the Norwalk agent. Attempts to cultivate or identify an infectious agent in vitro with the newer cell or intestinal organ culture techniques or in animals were unsuccessful.",

IEM also led to the discovery of other gastroenteritis agents such as the Montgomery County, Hawaii and Snow Mountain agents. Approximately 1 year after the discovery of the Norwalk virus, rotaviruses, the major etiologic agents of acute gastroenteritis of infants and young children, were discovered by electron microscopic techniques, again without the benefit of any in vitro system or animal model.",

This polyprotein contains short motifs of similarity with the 2C (helicase), 3C (cysteine protease), and 3D (RNA-dependent RNA polymerase) proteins of picornaviruses (\nFig. 3\n). Thus, the 5\u2032 end of the genome of the \u2018Norwalk-like viruses\u2019 codes for a precursor of the nonstructural proteins. ORF 2 encodes a 530aa (56.6 K) protein, the capsid protein. The ORF 2 protein expressed in insect cells self-assembles into virus-like particles as explained above (Fig. 1B). ORF 3 at the 3\u2032 end of the genome is predicted to code for a small protein of 212aa (22.5 K) with a very basic charge (isoelectric point of 10.99). The ORF 3 protein does not have sequence similarity with any other proteins in the GenBank and its function remains unknown, although recently the ORF 3 protein has been found in VLPs expressed from cDNA constructs that contain both ORF 2 and ORF 3.",

Therefore, serotypes remain to be more clearly defined, a goal that is unable to be achieved due to the lack of a cultivation system. Early volunteer studies also examined the ability of different viruses to induce crossprotection. Based on these studies in addition to IEM, Norwalk, Hawaii and Snow Mountain viruses were defined as separate serotypes (Table 1).

Until recently, diagnosis remained essentially a research problem because reagents were not readily available.\nDiagnosis is made by detection of Norwalk virus in a stool specimen or the demonstration of a fourfold or more antibody increase in a patient's paired sera. Detection of a serologic response is more efficient than virus detection for demonstrating evidence of Norwalk virus infection. Early assays for these viruses included IEM (for the entire group), and RIA and/or ELISA for the Norwalk, Hawaii and Snow Mountain viruses, as well as immune adherence hemagglutination assay (IAHA) for the Norwalk virus. The cloning of Norwalk virus provided a major impetus to the study of the natural history of Norwalk virus infection because of the potentially unlimited source of antigen in the form of recombinant baculovirus-expressed virus-like particles (Fig. 1b). This capsid antigen shares antigenic specificity with native Norwalk virus by IEM and ELISA. The availability of animal antisera to recombinant Norwalk VLPs has also enabled the development of an ELISA for virus antigen detection. The antigen ELISA is highly sensitive but also highly specific. Similar antigen ELISAs using VLPs from Grimsby, Hawaii, Snow Mountain, Mexico and Sapporo viruses are being developed, as well as other assays that can detect more broadly cross-reactive antigenic epitopes. Until these assays become widely available, detection of the viral genome by RT-PCR is a favored method for diagnosis. Because diagnostic reagents previously were not available, it was suggested from analysis of numerous Norwalk virus outbreaks that a provisional diagnosis of Norwalk virus infection can be made if the following criteria are met: (1) bacterial or parasitic agents are not detected; (2) the incubation period is 24\u201348 hours; (3) vomiting occurs in at least 50% of ill individuals; and (4) the mean or median duration of illness is 12\u201360 hours.",

Oral administration of isotonic fluids is usually sufficient for replacement of fluid and electrolyte loss. However, parenteral administration of fluids may be required if the vomiting or diarrhea is too severe to be managed by oral fluid replacement. Oral administration of bismuth subsalicylate can significantly reduce the severity and duration of abdominal cramps in volunteers challenged with Norwalk virus; the median duration of gastrointestinal symptoms was reduced from 20 hours to 14 hours, but this treatment did not affect significantly the number, weight and water content of stools and the level of virus excretion.",

Careful attention to hygienic precautions in the preparation of food and monitoring the purity of drinking water or swimming facilities should also be practiced. Although the mechanisms of immunity to Norwalk virus remain unclear, the increasing recognition of the importance of these infections suggests that a vaccine might be useful if it is shown to be effective.\nRecombinant Norwalk virus-like particles represent one vaccine candidate. These VLPs are highly immunogenic when administered orally or intranasally to mice without adjuvant and they have also been shown to be safe and immunogenic when administered orally to volunteers. It is likely that evaluation of the immune response to these particles will help us understand immunity to these enteric infections.",

Thus, all studies relied on the availability of particle-positive stools as the source of antigen. In spite of this limitation, important advances were made in the elucidation of the epidemiology, natural history, immunology and characterization of this group, with special emphasis on the prototype Norwalk strain. The cloning, characterization and expression of human calicivirus genomes represent another major breakthrough in the study of these viruses. Recent epidemiologic studies (allowed by new diagnostic assays) indicate that the epidemiology of infections with these viruses is not well understood, and infections are more common than realized previously. We predict that as human caliciviruses are studied, they will be found to play a significant role(s) in both acute and chronic human illness whose etiologies are currently unknown.",
