Worldwide, annual influenza epidemics are estimated to result in about 3 to 5 million cases of severe illness, and about 290 000 to 650 000 respiratory deaths reported by the World Health Organization (WHO)1. Currently, the most widely used anti-influenza drugs are matrix protein 2 (M2) inhibitors amantadine, rimantadine and the neuraminidase (NA) inhibitors oseltamivir, zanamivir2. However, clinical applications of these drugs are limited since the rapid development of antiviral drug resistance. It was reported that virtually all 2009 pandemic H1N1 and seasonal H3N2 strains were resistant to M2 inhibitors, most of the seasonal H1N1 isolates were oseltamivir resistant3, and a few isolates resistant to oseltamivir even had appeared in 2013 Asian H7N9 strain4. The increasing frequencies of drug-resistant virus strain highlight the need for novel antiviral strategies, such as drugs focus on different viral targets or cellular factors.",

Glycoprotein hemagglutinin (HA) of IAV plays a key role in the entry, since it confers virion ability of specific binding to host cells and subsequent membrane fusion. HA is synthesized as a fusion-inactive precursor (HA0) that could be cleaved into HA1 and HA2 fragments. The cleavage of HA0 is a necessary step for influenza virus to be contagious, as it liberates the fusion peptide which can insert into target membranes during fusion. On the other hand, the cleavage leads HA to be in a metastable conformation that can undergo the structural rearrangements required for fusion in endosome environment. However, IAV has no HA0 processing protease, cleavage of the HA0 is primarily accomplished by the host cellular proteases5.",

In animal models, TMPRSS2 deficiency protects mice against H1N1 (A/PR/8/34), mouse-adapted H1N1 (A/California/04/09) and H7N9 (A/Anhui/1/13) influenza A virus infections6,7. Genetic variants with higher TMPRSS2 expression confer higher risk to severe H1N1 (pdm09) and Asian H7N9 influenza A virus8. Furthermore, knocking out TMPRSS2 in mice does not cause any obvious phenotypic abnormality, such as death, infertility or visible sickness9. In addition, more recently, it is reported that TMPRSS2 can help SARS-CoV-2 for entry into host cells through entailing S protein cleavage10. The critical role in IAV and SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome CoV 2) infection and the nonvital physiological function of TMPRSS2 highlight an antiviral strategy that targets TMPRSS2 and inspire us to find small molecules that can inhibit IAV and SARS-CoV-2 infection via \u201cchemical knockout\u201d of TMPRSS2.",

Next, we designed and synthesized a series of benzoselenoxanthene derivatives and found that these compounds can induce the formation of and stabilize the G-quadruplex structure in the guanine-rich tract, causing down-regulation of TMPRSS2 expression and finally resulted in a reduction of influenza A virus (A/PR8/34) titers in vitro.

            "text": "Since the guanine-rich region was critical for TMPRSS2 promoter activity, we speculated that this tract contains some transcription factor bind site. To test the hypothesis, we searched for putative transcription factor binding site in this region with Jaspar (http://jaspardev.genereg.net/). Sp1 and EGR1 were identified as potential transcription factors that had multiple potential binding sites in the region. Then we confirmed the recruitment of Sp1 and EGR1 to this region by EMSA (Fig. 1C). The competition EMSA results demonstrated that the G-rich sequence indeed interacted with Sp1 and EGR1, and the protein: DNA complex was eliminated by the Sp1 and EGR1 consensus competitors but not the mutant competitors. These data provide preliminary evidence that the TMPRSS2 guanine-rich region contains Sp1 and EGR1 binding sites. In addition, when pCMV-Sp1 and pCMV-EGR1 were co-transfected with the pGL3-TMPRSS2-Wild, luciferase expression was increased by 5.2 folds and 0.5 folds, respectively. While we observed a 3-fold increase of luciferase expression when pCMV-Sp1 was co-transfected with pGL3-TMPRSS2-Mut and no significant luciferase expression changes when pCMV-EGR1 was co-transfected with pGL3-TMPRSS2-Mut (Fig. 1D). These results indicate that the guanine-rich region in TMPRSS2 promoter serves as Sp1 and EGR1 binding sequence and therefore is critical for TMPRSS2 transcription.",

In electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA), a DNA oligomer which can fold into an intramolecular G-quadruplex structure would migrate faster than a nonstructured single-stranded DNA, thus, it is possible to differentiate the intramolecular G-quadruplex structure from the other DNA structures by native PAGE15. As shown in Fig. 2A, the guanine-rich strand (TMPRSS2-G) dissolved in potassium-contained buffer migrated much faster than that dissolved in potassium-deficient buffer in native PAGE, suggesting that the TMPRSS2-G converted to the faster mobility species that might be intramolecular G-quadruplex in the presence of potassium ions; while the C-rich strand (TMPRSS2-C) dissolved in potassium-deficient buffer migrated as fast as that dissolved in potassium-contained buffer, indicating the TMPRSS2-C can\u2019t form any secondary DNA under such experimental conditions. However, with the exception of telomeres, it is well known that DNA\u2019s in genome mainly adopt the form of a right-handed double helix (B-DNA type). Because of the stability of the duplex DNA, there exists a barrier for the formation of G-quadruplex. It was reported that intracellular molecular crowded environment can promote the duplex DNA conversion to G-quadruplex configuration16. We, therefore, examined whether the desired TMPRSS2 G-quadruplex stably exists in the presence of complementary C-rich strand with or without PEG200 (a molecular crowding inducer) similar to actual in vivo crowded environment. In fact, the main band for complementary double-stranded DNA (ds NDA) migrated in line with 35 bp marker in the absence of PEG200, suggesting that it was insufficient to overcome the stability of the double-helix to form the G-quadruplex (Fig. 2B). While a new slower moving and weak band emerged corresponding to ca. 50 bp marker when two complementary strands were incubated in PEG200 contained buffer and the slower moving species could be explained due to formation of intramolecular G-quadruplexes in ds DNA. In addition, an ss C band from single-stranded C-rich TMPRSS2-C and a faster moving G-quadruplex band contributed to ss G-quadruplex formed by single-stranded G-rich TMPRSS2-G became stronger gradually with the increase of PEG200. These results indicate that such TMPRSS2 G-quadruplex structure exists in the presence of complementary C-rich strand or in ds DNA only under molecular crowded environment.",

The TMPRSS2-G CD spectrum exhibited a characteristic positive peak at 264 nm and a dip at 240 nm, which is the typical CD signature of a parallel G-quadruplex structure (Fig. 2E).

In our previous study18, we found that benzothioxanthene analogues can induce the formation of and stabilize telomeric G-quadruplexes. To improve stability of the G-quadruplex structure in guanine-rich single strand and further stabilize the G-quadruplex structure in ds DNA, we designed and synthesized seven benzoselenoxanthene analogues (Fig. 3A) and examined the their ability to stabilize the G-quadruplex(es). However, we found that only four compounds Se1, Se3, Se5 and Se7 have effect on the expression of TMPRSS2 gene protein (see Fig. 4B). Thus, Four of them were chosen to test whether stabilization of G-quadruplex was achievable or not. According to UV melting assay results (Fig. 3B; Supplementary Table S4), it was clear that analogues Se1, Se3, Se5 and Se7 remarkably increased the Tm value of the G-quadruplex, indicating these compounds improved the stability of the TMPRSS2-G G-quadruplex. Further, by EMSA assay we examined if compounds could induce the formation of and stabilize G-quadruplex structures in ds DNA (TMPRSS2-G + TMPRSS2-C). As shown in Fig. 3C, a new slower moving and bright band and unwinding bands became stronger upon adding compounds relative to control. The slower moving band should be attributed to the ds G-quadruplex contained structure since it had a similar migration rate as the PEG200 induced ds G-quadruplex16. Results of UV melting and EMSA assay both confirmed that benzoselenoxanthene derivatives can stabilize the G-quadruplex structure and prevent it converting back to a double helix structure. In addition, PCR stop assay was used to detect whether the G-quadruplex stabilization would result in inhibition of replication or transcription or not. As expected, the strand extension catalyzed by Taq polymerse was inhibited and the final double-stranded PCR product was decreased along with the increase of drug concentration (Fig. 3D and Supplementary Fig. S3).",

To test this hypothesis, the mRNA and protein expression of TMPRSS2 gene overexpressed in Calu-3 cells was measured in the presence of compounds by using quantitative real-time PCR and western blot analysis, respectively. As shown in Figs. 4A, 4B, Supplementary Fig. S4A, and Supplementary Table S5, the expression of TMPRSS2 gene decreased with increasing concentrations of compounds Se1, Se3, Se5 and Se7. Of note, we observed that compounds Se2, Se4, and Se6 almost have no influence on the expression of TMPRSS2 gene protein (Fig. 4B and Supplementary Fig. S4B) and the cause of the result is still unknown but under investigation. Thus, only four compounds Se1, Se3, Se5 and Se7 were used in other experiments. Next, dual luciferase assay was conducted to verify whether down-regulation of the gene expression resulted from G-quadruplex stabilization by compounds or not. As expected, in pGL3-TMPRSS2-Wild transfected group, luciferase expression was reduced by 25%, 24%, 20% and 28% upon the addition of 2 \u03bc\u039c of compounds, Se1, Se3, Se5 and Se7, respectively; while the pGL3-TMPRSS2-Mut driven luciferase activity was not affected so apparently by 2 \u03bc\u039c of the compounds, Se1, Se3, Se5 and Se7, with luciferase expression reduced by 12%, 10%, 7% and 10%, respectively (Fig. 4C; Supplementary Table S6). Collectively, these results strongly demonstrate that through stabilizing the G-quadruplex structure at cellular level, benzoselenoxanthene analogues can down-regulate the TMPRSS2 expression.",

In addition, we, also, examined that trypsin rescue the ability of novel designed compounds (Se1, S3, S5 and Se7) and Oseltamivir as a positive drug to inhibit IAV infection. The results in Fig. 5C showed that the inhibitory effects of Se1, Se3 and Se5 can obviously be rescued by trypsin while that of oseltamivir cannot. This is because trypsin possesses the ability to cleave hemagglutinin (HA) of IAV, consequently facilitating IAV entry into host cells and this type of compounds target TMPRSS2 gene DNA sequence. While Oseltamivir as a neuraminidase inhibitor can efficiently block sialidase activity and significantly inhibit the releasing mechanism of the newly synthesized virion from the infected cell19.

However, the cleavage pattern was slightly indefinite because of no specific structure dominated. This likely was attributable to this sequence being able to form an equilibrium mixture of multiple intramolecular G-quadruplex structures. As the guanine rich sequence contained seven runs of at least two contiguous guanines, it was greatly possibly folded into multiple overlapping G-quadruplex structures. Such complexity was also found in the guanine-rich tracts of BCL2 P1 promoter and BCL2 major breakpoint region. It was speculated that the complexity of G-quadruplex formation is probably important to itself stability or differential binding of proteins15,28,29. In all, the complexity of the G-quadruplex region needs further more detailed studies.",

            "text": "Previously, we had identified that benzothioxanthene derivatives can stabilize telomeric G-quadruplex and thus inhibit multiple tumor cell lines growth17. Therefore we expected that those compounds could also stabilize TMPRSS2 G-quadruplex, down-regulate TMPRSS2 expression and suppress IAV propagation ultimately. Unfortunately, under our experimental conditions, they only stabilized TMPRSS2 G-quadruplex at extracellular molecular level (Supplementary Figs. S7 and S8), and cannot suppress TMPRSS2 transcription in the examined cell line (Supplementary Fig. S9). The conflicting results may be due to the lack of selective binding ability of compounds to TMPRSS2 G-quadruplex structure in cells. Recently, J. Seenisamy reported an Se-contained porphyrin, Se2SAP, which selectively bound to the c-MYC G-quadruplex in the presence of duplex DNA and other G-quadruplexes, implying that introduction of selenium made the compound less photoactive and noncytotoxic in comparison to TMPyP430. Based on these studies, we designed and synthesized benzoselenoxanthene analogues. These compounds were found not only to greatly enhance the stability of the TMPRSS2 G-quadruplex structure at extracellular molecular level, but also to inhibit TMPRSS2 gene expression in Calu-3 cells. Moreover, more than 1 log10-unit reductions of virus titer were observed in cells treated with compounds, and the antiviral activity of these compounds were comparable to that of Oseltamivir.",

Down-regulating TMPRSS2 expression by benzoselenoxanthene ananlogues significantly inhibits IAV growth and spread in vitro. These findings indicate that modulation of TMPRSS2 expression through G-quadruplex structure stabilization in the gene promoter may be a novel anti-influenza strategy and this strategy may lead to developing new small molecule drugs against IAV. Also, this is of important value for developing new drugs anti- SARS-CoV-2.",
