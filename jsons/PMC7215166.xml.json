Since then it has rapidly spread, globally. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the disease a pandemic on 11 March 2020. As a response to the crisis, governments in numerous countries have introduced a series of steps aiming to curb the effects of the pandemic. The WHO has promoted SARS-CoV-2 testing and contact tracing to prepare health care systems to respond to the disease and limit spread within populations. \u201cSpatial distancing\u201d [1] is one of the strongly promoted practices and entails creating and keeping safe distances between individuals, as well as reducing the number of times individuals come into close contact with each other. The resulting regulations and recommendations include the temporary closures of childcare and educational institutions, and cultural and entertainment-related locales (e.g., clubs, cinemas, theaters, museums, sporting arenas). They also typically include encouraging employees and companies to use remote (home) working practices when feasible. In essence, spatial distancing is aimed at promoting staying home and self-isolation but, in some instances, it also involves limiting free movement and/or placing individuals in quarantine.",

Especially vulnerable are individuals with preexisting mental and physical health conditions, those lacking social support, and first responders and healthcare workers [5]. In extreme cases, fear may contribute to fatal outcomes and suicide, including among individuals who thought they had contracted the virus even though autopsies showed they did not (e.g., [6]). Time spent at home has increased considerably for most individuals, which may lead to a reduction or loss of daily routine and structure. Moreover, being in \u2018lockdown\u2019 alone (or with family members), coupled with high states of uncertainty regarding the future and financial insecurity, may also contribute to heightened stress, anxiety, depression and a general decrease in psychological wellbeing [2,7]. Concurrently, research into the precise psychological impact of the current situation is on-going; not all individuals will be unduly impacted to the same degree [8]. Nevertheless, it is worth acknowledging that the WHO has established general health guidelines for the staying home period that include useful tips for physical activity, mental health, parenting, healthy eating and quitting tobacco [9].",

These potentially addictive behaviors may help alleviate stresses of daily living (often reflected as \u201cescapism\u201d) and avoid problems and difficult thoughts [[10], [11], [12], [13]]. Although these behaviors typically constitute non-problematic (or perhaps even healthy) coping strategies, for a minority of individuals they can lead to reduced engagement in usual social interactions and other activities of daily living [14]. As a result, the tendency to use such substances and engage in the aforementioned behaviors as putative coping strategies in crises like the COVID-19 pandemic increases considerably and may develop into habits that are difficult to break [[15], [16], [17]].",

On the one hand, ICT is a \u201csavior\u201d; it contributes vitally to disseminating knowledge about the outbreak to wide sectors of the global population, to an extent not possible without such technology. Information flow is a key factor in fighting the pandemic (enabling individuals to have instant access to reliable information, while granting researchers with means for collaboration on a global scale in the race to develop a vaccine and efficient treatment strategies, for example). Working and studying remotely is possible due to the use of ICT. Keeping social contact remotely with friends/families to reduce psychological impacts of isolation, providing access to entertainment and even materials guiding physical exercise (e.g., live streaming home fitness sessions) are realized through ICT and represent strategies recommended by the WHO [18]. Furthermore, medical and psychological consultation and psychotherapy both in the case of addictive disorders and other mental disorders may be conducted online when appropriate [19].",

Disordered use of the internet generates marked distress and/or significant impairment in personal, family, social, educational, occupational, or other important areas of functioning [23,24]. Therefore, keeping involvement in these behaviors at moderate and controlled levels, especially during the pandemic, is imperative.

When dealing with difficulties, openly communicating about emotions with a close relative or friend, asking for help and feeling social support can effectively help to reduce stress and anxiety.\u2022Enjoying social activities and maintaining relationships are also crucial [25]. Family members should arrange to spend quality time with each other and have \u201cfamily time\u201d periods on a regular basis. Family time may include meaningful conversations, playing social games or sports, eating meals and doing household chores together.\u2022For individuals who live together with their family or others, it may be useful to find ways of being alone or having some self-time regularly. It may help to negotiate spaces in the house for individual and common use, as well as to establish and respect boundaries such as doors being open or closed. This may help reduce frustration and conflicts that may arise from being confined in the same place for long periods.\u2022Following the WHO advice to keep up-to-date on the status of the pandemic and public health advice from reliable news sources in a circumscribed way (e.g., watching a reputable news broadcast once or twice per day at a specified time) while limiting excessive exposure to such news can promote balanced and informed thinking about the pandemic.\n",

Reducing access or exposure by putting the smartphone/device somewhere where it is not constantly available when engaging in technology-free activities and turning off or muting notifications and associated sounds on mobile devices may be helpful methods of such self-regulation. Constantly checking social media or watching the news about the pandemic may have a negative impact on mental wellbeing.\u2022Monitoring and regulating children's behavior is also crucial and it may best be done by involving them in rule-making. Additionally, parents are role models; thus, regulating their own ICT-related behaviors (e.g., social media use, aimless surfing on the internet) may help their children to establish controlled use as well. Parents are also encouraged to actively participate in the ICT-related behaviors of their children (e.g., playing video games together with them). Such involvement of the parents will help them regulate their children's usage (e.g., by knowing the characteristics of different video games), as well as promote adaptive online activities and reduce the use of other ones.\u2022Using digital wellbeing apps (i.e., apps that provide feedback about the amount of time spent on different apps) can be helpful in raising awareness and self-regulation. Having pre-scheduled technology-free periods or programs, and setting specific limits for oneself (e.g., time and/or financial limits for online shopping, gambling or gaming), can all help maintain a healthy balance between screen-based and screen-free activities. Tracking per-session, daily, weekly and monthly limits may be helpful to minimize time online and financial expenditures.\u2022Using analogue technical tools (e.g., wristwatches, alarm clocks) when possible instead of ICT tools may help prevent overuse in certain situations (e.g., checking the time on a smartphone might turn into the use of other applications such as social media sites due to the notifications appearing on the locked screen) [26].\u2022Keeping in touch with friends, relatives and acquaintances (via internet or telephone) may help reduce feelings of loneliness during physical distancing and enhance quality of life. ICTs such as group calls, social media groups, and online video games can be useful in forming and maintaining meaningful relationships across physical distances.\u2022Seeking help if needed is also very important. If experiencing high levels of distress or significant difficulties controlling internet use or specific online activities (e.g., gambling, gaming, watching pornography), mental health professionals should be contacted. Helplines and telehealth consultations might be available depending on the country of residence. Seeking help in early stages may be especially effective to relieve symptoms.\n",
