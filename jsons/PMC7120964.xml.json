It is thought that the wide-range of infection rates may reflect the diversity of populations that require chronic inpatient care. Infections of the urinary and respiratory tracts are most commonly followed by skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI); these three clinical syndromes account for the majority of infections seen in the chronic care setting (1\u20133, 5). Gastrointestinal (GI) and bloodstream infections (BSI) are less frequently documented and, perhaps, are less prevalent (3). Cultures of blood have not been recommended in part because BSI are perceived to be uncommon; when present death occurs rapidly, and most residents transferred to hospital before the diagnosis of BSI can be made or advanced directives preclude evaluation (2, 6).",

Without culture of blood or tissue, the etiology of SSTI is rarely known, and differentiation between infection and superficial colonization is difficult (12, 13). Diarrhea is also a common cause of infection in LTCFs and often self-\u00adlimited unless Clostridium difficile is suspected, care is generally supportive. With the exception of C. difficile, fecal samples are rarely tested for viruses, as these tests are generally not available and parasites and other bacterial etiologies are relatively uncommon as causes of LTCF-associated diarrhea (2, 14, 15).",

Fever can be a very useful indicator if its definition is sufficiently sensitive to detect most infections in the population being evaluated. The most common definition of fever (temperature >101\u00b0F) is met in only 40% of LTCF residents. If the fever definition in this population is lowered to 100\u00b0F (37.8\u00b0C), then 70% of infections will be detected with a specificity of 90%. More than half of NH residents with a temperature of 100\u00b0F will have infection. Other investigators have suggested that baseline temperatures should be established for each resident; fever would be defined as an increase of 2\u00b0F (1.1\u00b0C) over the baseline temperature or >99\u00b0F (37.2\u00b0C) orally or 99.5\u00b0F (37.5\u00b0C) rectally (2, 5, 17).

Factors that contribute to aspiration appear to be the strongest predictors of pneumonia in LTCF residents (10, 30).",
