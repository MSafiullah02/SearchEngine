Incidence of prematurity is increasing in the United States.1 Respiratory distress syndrome remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in preterm infants, especially in the extremely low birth weight infants <1000 g.2 The incidence of RDS is inversely proportional to gestational age. With the increasing use of prenatal steroids, the incidence as well as the severity of RDS has decreased by nearly 50% over the last few years.3, 4 Respiratory distress syndrome occurs in approximately 50% of preterm infants born at <30 weeks gestation, but only in about 25% of those born \u2a7e30 weeks. Surfactant therapy has been shown to reduce the combined outcomes of death and bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) in preterm infants with RDS.5, 6",

Exogenous synthetic surfactants studied include colfosceril palmitate (Exosurf\u00ae, (GlaxoSmithKlein, Research Triangle, NC, USA, no longer in market)), pumactant, turfsurf, and lucinactant (Surfaxin\u00ae, Discovery Laboratories, Warrington, PA, USA). Of these four synthetic surfactants, the first three are no longer available for clinical use and lucinactant is pending approval from the FDA as of 2005. Several different natural, modified surfactant preparations have been studied. They differ in composition, onset of response, and duration of action, dosing volume, and the need for additional doses.

Since 1999, there have been six trials29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34 evaluating the outcome of early surfactant therapy followed by extubation to NCPAP (Table 3). Overall, these reports demonstrated decreased duration of mechanical ventilation and length of stay, and decreased need for additional doses of surfactant. In a recent study by the Texas Neonatal Research Group,35 rescue surfactant therapy in the more, mature preterm population (birth weight \u2a7e1250 g) with mild to moderate RDS not requiring mechanical ventilation showed no benefits following routine elective intubation for surfactant administration when compared to expectant management with intubation and surfactant treatment as clinically indicated. Further studies are needed to evaluate the effects of early surfactant therapy followed by extubation to NCPAP or nasal ventilation on the incidence of BPD. Use of NCPAP with or without surfactant therapy was shown to be consistently associated with a lower incidence of classical as well as the newly defined \u2018physiological\u2019 BPD.36",

Acute respiratory distress syndrome is often secondary to meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS), congenital pneumonia, sepsis-induced ARDS, viral pneumonia, pulmonary hemorrhage and partial or complete deficiency of SP-B. In these conditions, surfactant inactivation or dysfunction has been shown to be a major factor. Major mechanisms of surfactant inactivation in ARDS include decreased synthesis and secretion of surfactant by the type II pneumocytes, decrease in surface active small aggregates of surfactant in the alveoli, and direct inhibition of surfactant function by substances like meconium, blood, serum proteins or proteinaceous edema fluid.37",

In a multicenter study, Wiswell et al.42 examined the use of surfactant lavage for MAS using lucinactant, a synthetic surfactant.

Furthermore, early rescue (<30 min of age) surfactant therapy, followed by rapid extubation to NCPAP or nasal ventilation should be considered to minimize lung injury and BPD. In near-term or term newborns with ARDS secondary to MAS, sepsis induced ARDS, aspiration pneumonia, bacterial or viral pneumonia, and in patients with pulmonary hemorrhage, surfactant therapy appears to be beneficial. A dose of 50 to 100 mg/kg administered at 6 to 12 h intervals may be appropriate. Surfactant containing higher amounts of saturated phosphatidyl choline and SP-B, such as poractant alfa, may be preferable over other surfactants. However, no randomized trials comparing different surfactants in ARDS have been reported. Bolus instillation of surfactant or mini-saline lavage using 3 to 5 ml/kg, followed by bolus surfactant therapy appears to be well tolerated and effective in near-term and term newborns with ARDS.",
