However, the role of bioaerosols as an important natural transmission mechanism for influenza is actively debated (Tellier 2006, 2007a,b; Brankston et al. 2007; Gardam and Lemi2007; Lee 2007; Lemieux et al. 2007; Tang and Li 2007). One approach proposed to reduce the risk of infection by pathogenic bioaerosols, particularly to healthcare workers and first responders, is to incorporate an antimicrobial agent into the air filters of respiratory protection devices. Common antimicrobials can be applied to the surfaces of filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs), including quaternary ammonium compounds (Price et al. 1993), N\u2010halamines and silver (Foarde et al. 2000; Verdenelli et al. 2003; Cecchini et al. 2004; Sullivan 2006), but these are expected to act only on captured particles to suppress contact transfer.",

A patent (Messier 2000) has been issued for the use of PSTI as a constituent at the fibre surface of air filtration media, and in vitro studies have reported a 2\u2010log (99%) increase in viable removal efficiency (VRE) after passage through air purification media incorporating PSTI compared to standard filtration systems (Heimbuch et al. 2004; Heimbuch and Wander 2006; Lee and Wu 2006; Lee et al. 2009).

(2008) proposed that the water\u2010based mechanism proposed by Taylor et al. \u2013 capture of I2 from the surface of the I3\u2212 complex during collisions with passing microbes \u2013 can be extended to describe a short, through\u2010space capture process from treated fibres, induced by near collisions with bioaerosols as they penetrate an air filter medium. However, the in vitro assay they used includes a transfer step in water \u2013 which can interact indiscriminately with either background I2 or I2 captured by passing micro\u2010organisms to provide a fast mechanism of devitalization. Lee et al. (2009) and Rengasamy et al. (2010) showed that water vapour has a role in the disinfection mechanism, and numerous examples have been reported in which proteins react competitively to consume I2 (McFarlane 1956; Eninger et al. 2008; Lee et al. 2009) by several mechanisms. Quenching experiments collecting filtered bioaerosols in solutions containing thiosulfate or bovine serum albumin showed the process of devitalization by captured I2 in air to be relatively slow (Lee et al. 2009) and possibly unimportant on the time scale of inspiration behind an FFR. Thus, if protection is to be improved significantly by passing exposure to PSTI during filtration, the protective process must occur at the point of contact with the respiratory mucosal surface (an aqueous medium containing potentially interfering proteins), which can be tested only by controlled, quantitative exposure experiments using an animal model.",

Unrelated studies have demonstrated reduced rates of infection by adding filters to livestock housing (Hopkins and Drury 1971; Burmester and Witter 1972; Dee et al. 2005, 2006a,b). However, the inhalation studies did not include filters and the animal studies examined only casual transmission between animals and did not expose the animals to a metered challenge of aerosol in a controlled design. Controlled delivery of graduated doses of infective aerosols through reactive and inert filters is a novel approach to measure the clinical significance of respiratory protection devices. Development and characterization of the delivery system described below is the necessary enabling step to realize this capability.",

The CATS generates a biological aerosol at a range of constant concentrations, passes the aerosol through a filter and delivers the penetrating particles to the nose of a mouse model of human respiration.

Including the reported collection efficiency of the impinger (Hogan et al. 2005) raises this value to ~9 \u00d7 10\u22127 ml m\u22123. From this, the VSF at the Collison nozzle can be calculated to be ~2\u00b74 \u00d7 10\u22126 ml m\u22123 by scaling by the ratio of total flow (5\u00b73 l min\u22121) to flow through the Collison (2 l min\u22121). This is comparable to VSFs measured by Henderson (1952) for B. subtilis at the end of the spray tube in his apparatus (3\u00b75 \u00d7 10\u22126 to 4\u00b71 \u00d7 10\u22126 ml m\u22123), which indicates that the nebulization method is operating without unusual losses in the CATS.

From the data measured in this work, and reasoning based on the literature, one can conclude that the downstream PSD and viable airborne concentration remain steady for long enough to accurately deliver the challenges. The next step is to select an appropriate viral pathogen and susceptible animal to illustrate the use of the CATS. To evaluate the clinical merit of PSTI in the N99 medium, it will be necessary either to substitute an aerosolization technique that delivers a more\u2010concentrated viable aerosol or to concentrate the aerosol after generation. The latter approach is plausible because viable concentration is measured in the stream delivered to the animals. Other noncontact antimicrobial principles (e.g. an energy\u2010based technology such as singlet oxygen or ultraviolet radiolysis) could likewise be tested in the CATS, and this demonstration also implies that the effect of leakage around the protective device can be evaluated using the same technology.",
