A discrete time stochastic model that uses a back-projection approach is proposed. Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are developed for estimation of model parameters. The algorithm is further extended to integrate numerically over unobserved variables of the model. Applying the method to SARS data from Hong Kong, a value of 3.88 with a posterior standard deviation of 0.09 was estimated for the basic reproduction number. An estimate of the transmission parameter at the beginning of the epidemic was also obtained as 0.149 with a posterior standard deviation of 0.003. A reduction in the transmission parameter during the course of the epidemic forced the effective reproduction number to cross the threshold value of one, seven days after control interventions were introduced. At the end of the epidemic, the effective reproduction number was as low as 0.001 suggesting that the epidemic was brought under control by the intervention measures introduced.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, commonly known as SARS, is a new viral respiratory illness caused by a coronavirus, called SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) (Leung et al., 2004) . The disease was first identified in China's southern province of Guangdong on 16 November, 2002 and then spread rapidly throughout the world via air travel with the last known case with a symptom onset date of 5 July identified in Taiwan (Chowell et al., 2003) . It is reported that the epidemic infected 8098 cases (with 774 deaths), from a total of 28 countries (Chau and Yip, 2003a) . A large proportion of the morbidity and the mortality was borne by Hong Kong with a total number of 1755 cases and 302 deaths occuring between 15 February 2003 and 31 May 2003 (Leung et al., 2004) . Some of the measures introduced by the Hong Kong authorities to combat the disease include among others, public service announcements, addition of SARS to the list of notifiable diseases, a 2-week suspension of schools, introduction of health declarations for incoming residents and visitors, isolation of cases and home quarantining of close contacts and restrictions on their travel out of the country (Chau and Yip, 2003a) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 165, "end": 185, "text": "(Leung et al., 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 426, "end": 448, "text": "(Chowell et al., 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 552, "end": 573, "text": "(Chau and Yip, 2003a)", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 752, "end": 772, "text": "(Leung et al., 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1179, "end": 1200, "text": "(Chau and Yip, 2003a)", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "Using discrete time data on an ongoing SARS epidemic in Hong Kong, Donnelly et al. (2003) estimated the mean and variance of the incubation time, time from admission to discharge and time from admission to death. These parameters were obtained using maximum likelihood estimation methods assuming a gamma distribution for each period with allowance for censoring due to incomplete observation. The estimate of the mean and variance of the incubation period was 6.37 days and 16.69 days, respectively. The estimated mean and variance of the admission-to-death time was 35.9 days and 572.9 days, respectively, and the estimated mean and variance of the time from admission to discharge was 23.5 days and 62.1 days, respectively. As pointed out by Leung et al. (2004) , parameters above suffer from right censoring since they were obtained using data from an ongoing epidemic. To address the problem of censoring above, the authors re-estimated parameters above using complete data on all the 1755 cases. The data was completed by using laboratory verification tests on 83.6% of the cases. They estimated the mean incubation period to be 4.6(3.99) days (standard errors in brackets). They also estimated that the time from onset to recovery, and the time from onset to death each followed a gamma distribution with mean 26.5(14.0) and 23.7(14.9) days, respectively (standard errors in brackets). Using parameters estimated by Donnelly et al. (2003) and weekly data on an ongoing SARS epidemic in Hong Kong, Riley et al. (2003) estimated the basic reproduction number (R 0 ) from a discretized stochastic meta-population SEIR model as 2.7 with a 95% confidence interval of (2.2,3.7). It is evident that estimates obtained by Leung et al. (2004) are different from those obtained Donnelly et al. (2003) and as such the estimate of 2.7 above may be biased as it was obtained using estimates obtained with right censored data. It is imperative that a better estimate of the basic reproduction number would be obtained by using estimates obtained by Leung et al. (2004) are different from those obtained Donnelly et al.

It is imperative that a better estimate of the basic reproduction number would be obtained by using estimates obtained by Leung et al. (2004) . By studying the exponential growth at the beginning of the epidemic and by estimating the generation time, Lipsitch estimated R 0 to be between 2.2 and 3.6. Using a likelihood-based approach on an ongoing epidemic, Wallinga and Tenius (2004) estimated R 0 to be between 2.2 and 3.7. McBryde et al. (2006) applied Bayesian inference techniques to estimate the basic reproduction number and other epidemiological determinants from data arising from a SARS epidemic in Shanzi province of China.

(2003) is considered. Riley et al. (2003) used a discretized stochastic metapopulation SEIR model with a gamma distribution (formulated as a sum of exponential distributions) used for the waiting time in each disease compartment. The model considered here is a single population version of the model of Riley et al. (2003) with a back-projection method (Brookmeyer and Gail, 1986) , used instead of a gamma distribution represented as a sum of independent exponential random variables. The single population model is motivated by the complete SARS data discussed in the previous section and by the fact that it requires less detail to specify and less data for inference as compared to the model of Riley et al. (2003) . A description of the model is as follows; assume that an individual is susceptible (S) until exposed to infection. Once infected an individual goes through an exposure stage (E) where they are not infectious followed by an infectious (I) stage where they are classified into two categories \u00f0I \u00c0 \u00de and \u00f0I \u00fe \u00de. The classification is based on whether an infectious individual will proceed to die \u00f0R \u00c0 \u00de with probability p or proceed to recover \u00f0R \u00fe \u00de with probability 1 \u00c0 p.

This approach has been shown to be successful in epidemic modelling (Becker, Watson and Carlin, 1991; Becker und Xu, 1994) and particularly in reconstructing SARS epidemics (Chau and Yip, 2003a, b) . Introduction of control interventions will usually reduce the transmission parameter b\u00f0t\u00de. Capturing the change in b\u00f0t\u00de as the epidemic progresses is made difficult by the fact that there is usually little or no information to be used to quantify the changes in the transmission parameter. Riley et al. (2003) assumed for simplicity that b\u00f0t\u00de took three different values on three equally spaced time periods over the whole observation period. Choosing the number of change points may be difficult and as such modelling b\u00f0t\u00de as described above may be difficult to implement. Usually, the time at which control interventions are introduced is known. To avoid the problem of change points, it is assumed that the transmission parameter b\u00f0t\u00de is constant up to the time point when the control measures are introduced and after that decays exponentially.

It should however be mentioned that this simple form of b\u00f0t\u00de may not capture the heterogeneity in SARS epidemics brought about by superspreader events (rare events where an individual may generate many more than the average number of secondary cases). Thus, b\u00f0t\u00de is used here for simplicity.

The MCMC algorithm is applied to the simulated data pretending that B is unobserved. Initially, the performance of the back-projection method in reconstructing the series is inspected. In Figure 2 the simulated series C; D \u00fe and D \u00c0 are shown along with their means estimated via the back-projection method. Figure 2 suggests that the back-projection method produces sensible means in all the cases and hence a Poisson distribution with this mean will be a reasonable way of rejecting/accepting proposals for B. Inference is then conducted using two parameter sets for the prior distribution of b and q. At first, a non-informative prior set fb $ U\u00f00; 1\u00de; q $ U\u00f00; 1\u00deg is used to run the MCMC algorithm followed by an informative prior set fb $ G\u00f00:2; 0:002\u00de; q $ G\u00f00:1; 0:0005\u00deg.

In each case, after discarding a burn-in period of 10 000, a sample of size 1000 taken every 1000 iterations of the chain was used to obtain posterior distributions. Convergence was verified using convergence diagnostic measures and the chains were deemed to have converged. Figure 3 shows the estimated posterior distributions of the parameters obtained for different prior cases. Posterior means and standard deviations are reported in Table 1 . In all the two cases the Markov chain appeared to have converged after the burn-in period. The posterior means are well in agreement with the ML-estimate obtained from the complete data.

This is larger than the value of 2.7 estimated by Riley et al. (2003) but smaller than the value of 4.8 estimated by McBryde et al. (2006) . The estimate is of the same magnitude as the value of 3.6 estimated by Wallinga and Tenius (2004) . The fact that a more precise value of R 0 is obtained in this study than was previously obtained from other studies could possibly be explained by the following reasons. Firstly, parametric forms of f ; g \u00fe and g \u00c0 already estimated by other scholars are used and secondly unlike in the case of Riley et al. (2003) where only one time series fC\u00f0t\u00deg was used, this time series along with two other time series are used, thus improving the data availability. Moreover, the use of the back-projection for rejection sampling purposes gives the model more detail as this method has been shown to successfully reconstruct SARS epidemics. An estimate for the transmission parameter b was obtained as 0.149 with a posterior standard deviation of 0.003. This estimate is consistent with a daily infectivity at the beginning of the epidemic of 0.15 obtained by McBryde et al. (2006) . The model predicts that the effective reproduction number crosses the threshold value of one, seven days after control interventions were introduced. At the end of the epidemic, the effective reproduction number is as low as 0.001 suggesting that the epidemic was brought under control by the intervention measures. A posterior predictive distribution of final sizes shown in Figure 5 (b) does not indicate any evidence of lack of fit (p-value is 0.512). The fit of the model is also evident from Figure 5(a) where the predicted number of cases is consistent with the observed cases. The Bayes factor computed following the method of Chib and Jeliazkov (2001) was used to compare the proposed model with the model whereby f ; g \u00fe and g \u00c0 were assumed to follow a geometric distribution with the same mean as the gamma distributions used here. The geometric distribution is used here as in Lekone and Finkenst\u00e5dt (2006) as a discrete approximation to the exponential distribution. The theoretical details of the scheme used to calculate the marginal likelihood of each model can be found in Section 2.3 of Chib and Jeliazkov (2001) .

In the case that such data are available, modelling heterogeneity by incorporating it into the form of b\u00f0t\u00de or by using a meta-population model as in Riley et al. (2003) will be valuable. The model used here uses three time series of data that can read- ily be obtained by health practitioners in case of an outbreak and as such is easy to implement. However, better modelling ways of quantifying control interventions are desirable. The back-projection method was in this article used solely to construct an efficient proposal for the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm in order to impute the unobserved process fB\u00f0t\u00deg. This was motivated by the fact that the method reconstructed the SARS epidemic quite well as was shown by Chau and Yip (2003a, b) . The MCMC method can be modified to incorporate variability on the parameters of the gamma distributions used. These are assumed to be fixed in this paper, an assumption that might not be realistic as these are observed with error in real life situations. Computation of the Bayes factor can be quite difficult to compute especially in models with high number of parameters (Chib and Jeliazkov, 2001 ). However, this difficulty was not encountered in this article as only two parameters b and q were of interest. In the case that a variation of the model proposed here leads to a high dimensional parameter vector, then blocking methods as suggested by Chib and Jeliazkov (2001) can be used. The modelling approach proposed in this article is easy to implement and requires data that is not difficult to collect and hence can be applied to data sets arising from diseases with similar dynamics to SARS.
