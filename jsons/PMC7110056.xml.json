Further, coronavirus entry, including fusion, proteases and viral RNA were already envisaged as antiviral targets.4,5 The heavily glycosylated coronavirus envelope constitutes an appealing target for therapeutic intervention.

The N protein wraps the genomic RNA into a nucleocapsid and is not exposed on the outside of the virus particle. The S, M and E proteins, of which the former two are glycosylated, are anchored in the envelope. The M protein, which contains a short ectodomain, is the most abundant envelope glycoprotein, and usually contains one glycan tree. The heavily glycosylated S protein, which mediates virus\u2013cell attachment and fusion, forms large trimers that protrude from the virion surface. Two different coronaviruses were used to study the mode of action of CBA. Feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) strain 79-1146 causes a progressive systemic infection in cats. Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) strain A59 induces neuropathy and liver inflammation in mice. The interaction of CBA with the different virus envelope glycoproteins was evaluated. Furthermore, it was determined which step of the virus entry process was affected by the CBA. Finally, the influence of glycan maturation and cell-type specificity of glycosylation on inhibition by CBA was assessed. The results facilitate future research on coronavirus glycosylation and anti-coronavirus therapy.",

Pedersen, Davis, CA, USA) were used for experiments with, and propagation of, feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV strain 79-1146) and FIPV-\u03943abcFL. FIPV 79-1146 is a serotype II feline coronavirus. FIPV-\u03943abcFL contains a firefly luciferase gene in a FIPV 79-1146 background.30,31 Mouse LR7 cells, an L-2 murine fibroblast cell line stably expressing the murine hepatitis virus receptor32, were used for the experiments with, and propagation of, MHV (strain A59) and the M gene MHV mutants Alb138, Alb244, Alb248 and MHV-EFLM. M gene MHV mutants designated Alb138, Alb244, Alb248 contained, respectively, an O-glycosylated, a N-glycosylated or an unglycosylated M protein at the amino-terminal ectodomain.33 The Alb138 O-glycosylated mutant is biologically identical to MHV A59. MHV-EFLM contains a firefly luciferase gene in a MHV A59 background.30,31 All mentioned cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), 100 IU/mL penicillin and 100 mg/L streptomycin. Titrations and tests were performed on the same medium containing only 5% FBS. MHV-EFLMHeLa is an MHV-EFLM strain propagated on HeLa cells stably expressing murine carcinoembryonic antigen cell adhesion molecule 1a (mCEACAM1a) (M. H. Verheije, unpublished data). For the production of FIPV-\u03943abcFLHeLa HeLa cells stably expressing the feline coronavirus receptor, feline aminopeptidase N (fAPN) was used.34 Both cell lines were maintained on DMEM containing 10% FBS, 100 IU/mL penicillin, 100 mg/L streptomycin and 0.5 mg/mL G418 (Life Technologies, Ltd, Paisley, UK).",

Syncytia were abundant in the infected cells without CBA treatment, whereas syncytium formation was markedly reduced to a low level when CBA were present, although syncytia were not completely absent. Representative pictures are shown in Figure 1. UDA and HHA were the most potent syncytium-inhibiting agents. We conclude that the syncytium formation is significantly reduced in the presence of CBA, most likely due to binding of these compounds to the coronavirus S glycoproteins.",

The three different MHV variants were evaluated for their sensitivity to GNA, HHA, UDA and PRM-A. The EC50 values of the compounds were determined by IPOX (Table 1). Recombinant virus Alb248 (O\u2212N+) showed the highest sensitivity to the CBA (EC50 0.4\u20131.2 mg/L for the plant lectins and 2.0 mg/L for PRM-A) among all mutant virus strains.

The fusion process can start at an incubation temperature of 37\u00b0C. When cells and virus were inoculated at 4\u00b0C and subsequently incubated at 37\u00b0C (+/+), both steps in the presence of antiviral compounds, the number of MHV-EFLM infected cells (expressed as RLU) significantly reduced (Figure 2). The presence of CBA during the fusion but not the attachment stage only reduced the infection when UDA and PRM-A were used. The presence of HHA, UDA or PRM-A only during the binding stage (+/\u2013) did not inhibit but surprisingly enhanced MHV-EFLM infection, an effect most pronounced for UDA. Similar procedures performed with GNA (+/\u2013) led in some but not all cases to a slight enhancement of infection (not shown). Summarizing, in order to inhibit virus infection, the mannose-binding plant lectins GNA and HHA must be present during the entire infection process.

The influence of high-mannose-containing N-glycans on viral glycoproteins was evaluated using MHV-EFLM and FIPV-\u03943abcFL both derived from their host cells treated with dMM (designated MHV-EFLMdMM and FIPV-\u03943abcFLdMM).

Moreover, the GlcNAc-binding lectin UDA showed a higher inhibitory potency towards MHV-EFLMdMM and FIPV-\u03943abcFLdMM infection of cell cultures compared with non-dMM-treated viruses. This gain in antiviral activity of CBA to virus derived from dMM-treated compared with non-dMM-treated (WT) cells was represented in the EC50 and EC90 values (Figure 3).

            "text": "During a productive coronavirus infection, the S protein undergoes a series of conformational changes following attachment to the viral receptor molecule. This interaction eventually mediates fusion of the viral envelope with the host cell membrane.36,37 CBA are likely to interfere during the virus entry process by attaching to the N-glycans of the S protein, although the exact mode of action of CBA is not clear. For HIV-1, CBA are thought to inhibit the infection via binding to gp120, resulting in steric hindrance or detrimental conformational changes.19 For the SARS coronavirus, CBA were proposed to exhibit a dual mode of action: inhibiting both virus fusion and exocytosis or viral egress from the cell.38 Our studies demonstrated that CBA interfere with the coronavirus entry process by targeting of the N-glycosylated M and S envelope proteins. Furthermore, the antiviral efficacy of the CBA was significantly affected by the maturation state of the N-glycans on the envelope glycoproteins.",

Similar results were obtained for MHV, as virus attachment was not inhibited by all CBA tested. PRM-A and UDA were able to efficiently block virus entry when added at a post-binding step. The inhibitory activity of HHA and GNA however, only became apparent when these agents were present during the entire entry process. This result may be explained by the difference in size between the CBA. While HHA and GNA are \u223c50 kDa in size, PRM-A and UDA are much smaller (0.83 and 8.5 kDa, respectively). We speculate that the large CBA must bind to the S protein prior to the interaction of the S protein with the receptor. Strikingly, an enhancement of virus infection was noticed when some CBA were present during the attachment phase only. This surprising result might be explained by a tethering effect of CBA, which might facilitate virus\u2013cell attachment and subsequently productive infection.47 Indeed, the CBA evaluated in this study are able to bind multiple carbohydrate moieties.11,12",

As a consequence, the viral glycoproteins contain immature N-glycans of the high mannose type.48 This resulted in a much higher sensitivity of the viruses for the CBA tested. Apparently, the mannose content of the N-glycan trees determines the CBA efficacy. It should be noted that also the antiviral activity of UDA increased towards viruses carrying high mannose glycans. At a first glance, this might suggest that UDA possesses both a GlcNAc and mannose tropism. Alternatively, UDA has been shown to bind more efficiently to GlcNAc in the presence of high amounts of mannose residues.21",
