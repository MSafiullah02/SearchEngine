            "text": "Infectious disease epidemics, like human history or evolutionary history, are historically contingent processes\u2014early events have a strong influence on later ones. Invasive epidemics are particularly sensitive to rare events that introduce infectious agents into naive populations such as through host species shifts or long-distance translocation (LDT) of infected hosts (Mollison, 1986). The introduction of West Nile virus into New York City (Lanciotti et al., 1999) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus throughout Asia and into several additional countries including Canada (Berger et al., 2004), provide unambiguous demonstrations of the significance of LDTs in transforming regional health concerns into pandemic threats. Spatial heterogeneity also plays an important role in the spatio-temporal dynamics and management of emerging infectious diseases and invasive species. Local spread across space is typically characterized as a travelling wave, with a well-defined front generated by local transmission or dispersal. Heterogeneity in the distribution of hosts or habitats warps the shape of the invasive front (Murray et al., 1986). An invasive front may fail to propagate through areas with low host population density. In other cases, the invasive front may be blocked by landscape features, such as rivers or mountain ranges (Smith et al., 2002, Russell et al., 2004, Lucey et al., 2002), in which case the front may stall or find another route across a landscape. An invasion can leap across bad habitat or barriers by rare, but important, LDT events that may occur through atypical dispersal modes. These LDT events minimize the delay in spread caused by spatial heterogeneity.",

            "text": "The epidemic spread of rabies has been a useful system for understanding the spatio-temporal dynamics of infectious agents. Early approaches to understanding the red fox rabies epidemic in post-WWII Europe focused on using reaction-diffusion systems of coupled partial differential equations, including terms for heterogeneity in the density of foxes (Murray et al., 1986, Mollison, 1991, Shigesada and Kawasaki, 1997). On homogeneous landscapes, these models predict that an epidemic front will move at a linear rate away from the point of origin in concentric circles. Stochastic models generate different predictions about the rate of spread and the coherent shape of the front (Mollison, 1991). In stochastic models, rare LDT events can generate nascent foci well in advance of an epidemic front\u2014stochastic simulation models produce such patterns when the frequency of LDT is high enough, or in other words, if the dispersal kernel has a suitably fat tail (Lewis and Pacala, 2000). Given a stochastic model, it is possible to predict the frequency of LDT events, the distribution of their location relative to a front, and their effect on the shape of the front. On the other hand, the location of nascent foci is unpredictable. Moreover, many LDT events may establish nascent foci, followed by stochastic fade-out. Such events may provide information about the frequency of LDT, but failed foci are unimportant, historically, because they did not initiate sustained spread.",

            "text": "Stochastic modeling approaches have been difficult to apply to raccoon rabies surveillance data for several reasons. Usually, no comprehensive map of raccoon density exists before the epidemic. By way of contrast, maps for the density of foxes in the UK were used to make projections and establish management plans for a potential epidemic, but fox rabies has never been introduced there, so the model remains un-validated (Murray et al., 1986). The most detailed data available are from Connecticut and New York for which the location of raccoons was recorded by township. Of course, townships are defined politically and rarely describe relevant ecological boundaries. Thus, even if fine-scale spatial heterogeneity were important, the data contain no information about it. Nevertheless, townships may be considered as distinct habitat patches, and mathematical models for the spread of rabies along the networks defined by the adjacency of townships have been developed (Smith et al., 2002, Russell et al., 2004). Thus, mathematical models for the spread of rabies could be applied to these patch-based models as if they were a meta-population (Hanski, 1999). Using these network models in an exploratory data analysis, we have asked different questions. Given the observed spatio-temporal record of rabies cases, which putative LDT events influenced the time-course of the epidemic by initiating new foci of infection beyond the advancing front? Of equal interest, which putative LDTs were the result of \u201cfailed\u201d introductions that did not initiate new epidemic foci or were \u201cfalse\u201d LDTs, possibly resulting from mis-classification due to false positive diagnoses of rabies at laboratories conducting testing? False positives in rabies testing, or test results that cannot be confirmed by multiple laboratories testing the same sample, are not uncommon (McQuiston et al., 2001, CDC, 2002). Finally, real epidemics may have continued generating cases that were undetected by surveillance.",

In the subsequent 48 months, at least one case of raccoon rabies was detected in 168 of Connecticut's 169 townships; no case was ever recorded from Waterford township. More detailed descriptions of the data are provided elsewhere (Wilson et al., 1997, Lucey et al., 2002). When the first case was detected in a township, that township was considered \u201cinfected.\u201d For most townships, several cases were reported in the months following the first case. We restricted our analysis to the cases observed in the 36 months following the first reported case, after which the natural rate of wave front spread masked our ability to discern LDTs. For modeling purposes, we let Oi denote the number of months elapsed from the first observed case in Ridgefield and the first observed case in the ith township. To compute the distances between townships, we used the township's centroid, projected onto the plane. Let d\ni,j denote the distance between the centroids of townships i and j. We also defined the adjacency matrix among the 169 townships; two townships were said to be adjacent if they shared a common border at any point. The adjacency matrix was generated by visual inspection of a map of Connecticut. By inspection, we also identified townships that were separated from one another by a river or other large body of water.",

Most importantly, we developed a method for systematically identifying putative LDT events, classifying these early reports, and evaluating and quantifying their impact as nascent foci for rabies spread beyond the wave front using a network model. The network model has inherent advantages over regression analysis because the spread on networks mimics the underlying process, and networks can represent arbitrary distributions of heterogeneous habitat variables and complex landscape features (Lucey et al., 2002). In classifying these early cases, we developed multiple, rigorous criteria for weighing other cases within the township and in surrounding townships. In quantifying the impact, we have also developed a method for reconstructing the historical path of an invasive species.",

Using the network distance model, we found a five-fold slowing effect associated with rivers, consistent with earlier findings of a factor of 7 (Smith et al., 2002). Notably, we found a new, three-fold difference in the overland rate of spread associated with the percent of forest cover in a township. Moreover, the slowing effect of rivers was strongly modified by the amount of forest cover. In lightly forested areas, the rate of rabies spread between townships separated by a river was a factor of 2 slower. In heavily forested areas, the models predicted that rabies would never cross rivers, a much stronger effect than previously estimated. The impact of human populations was also investigated (results not shown); human population density was strongly negatively correlated with forest cover, but forest cover consistently provided a better fit than human population density.",

Only Branford had a strong influence, becoming a new focus of epidemic spread to the local neighborhood. A secondary, minor focus was identified with a putative LDT event in Plainfield.

This raccoon rabies epidemic is unprecedented in size and scope, spreading north through Connecticut and to the border of Canada, and east to Ohio (Hanlon and Rupprecht, 1998, MMWR, 1999, Krebs et al., 2001). A long-distance translocation event from Florida most likely initiated the epidemic near the border between West Virginia and Virgina (Nettles, 1979). Moreover, the raccoon rabies epidemic in Connecticut was initiated by a long-distance translocation event in southeastern New York (Russell et al., 2004). Therefore, the scale at which these events are explored and defined are decisive when considering their overall impact on epidemics.",

For example, a LDT event in Branford allowed rabies to jump the Housatonic river; by forcing the epidemic in Branford, we found a stronger effect associated with forest cover compared with the analogous model unforced by Branford. Another LDT event allowed rabies to jump the Housatonic river and the Connecticut river into South Windsor less than a year after Ridgefield, but the epidemic failed to spread into the surrounding townships. Similar LDT events in Groton, Enfield, Union, and Putnam would have reduced the delay in spread caused by the Connecticut river had they become foci of infection.",

For example, where should efforts be focused to contain the spread of emerging infectious diseases or invasive species? Is it possible to create a cordon sanitaire? What are the best strategies for controlling rabies around nascent foci that have jumped even the most effective barriers by LDT? Efforts to contain an epidemic can be enhanced by using natural barriers and areas where dispersal is naturally slowed. Our models suggest that vaccine baits might be most effective at containing the spread if distributed along river banks in lightly forested areas, those with less than 12% forestation. But, the unanswerable questions are how effective can natural or vaccine enhanced-barriers be and for how long can we expect them to remain effective when given the calculus of LDTs? LDT events were common in Connecticut, but many did not spread rabies to other townships. LDT events remain unpredictable, but may be discovered early by good surveillance. Our analysis suggests that such foci may be amenable to control, but the answerable questions need to be addressed and interventions planned before events occur.",
