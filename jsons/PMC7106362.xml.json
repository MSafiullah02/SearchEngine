            "text": "Current models of immunological activation have expanded our knowledge from single ligand\u2013receptor interactions to integrated models in which several receptors have a combinatorial role in the activation of a specific type of immune cell. The model of T cell activation is a clear example of this; whereas the canonical T cell receptor (TCR) is thought to provide the primary activating signal, co-stimulatory receptors and soluble factors have become integral parts of a more complex picture [1]. Similarly, mast cells are primarily activated by the IgE receptors (such as Fc\u03b5RI), but soluble factors, inhibitory, activating, and coactivating receptors can together modulate the activities of mast cells [2]. The complexity of immunological signalling is best exemplified in natural killer (NK) cells. In these cells, no single receptor is ultimately responsible for cellular activation; rather, a balance of signals from a wide variety of activating receptors, coactivating receptors, and inhibitory receptors (again, together with soluble factors) determines NK cell activity [3]. A more comprehensive understanding of these integrative signalling processes has recently become of great clinical significance owing to the development of immune checkpoint inhibitors.",

We first discuss how paired receptors are defined and how they may have evolved. We describe their complex expression patterns and determine what controls their activities. We hypothesise that the paired receptors that have probably evolved mainly in response to pathogens are now also used to maintain immune cells in a responsive state. We further suggest that they also limit overzealous inflammation by dampening the activation signals provided by the coactivating receptors that could (at least in some cases) lead to autoimmunity. Furthermore, we discuss how pathogens manipulate paired receptors, to infect cells and subsequently evade immune attack. Finally, we examine the potential use of the paired receptors as therapeutic targets in various clinical situations and propose that the paired receptors might be involved in immune cell education; the process by which immune cells acquire functional capabilities.",

Due to text limitations we are not able to elaborate on all possible aspects of all of the paired receptors and we instead highlight several examples. Furthermore, although there are many known paired receptors, both in humans and in mice, we focus mainly on a few well-characterised human pairs that enable us to best present the general principles we outline. In that regard, we do not discuss here paired receptors in which the inhibitory and the activating proteins that recognise the same ligand are not well defined [such as the leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor (LILR) family], or receptors in which one of the pair seemed not to function in humans (such as paired immunoglobulin-like type 2 receptor \u03b1; PILRA).",

These receptors, which recognise the same cellular ligands, seemed to evolve together through gene duplication [18]. Paired receptors belong to many different families of molecules, and they include members of the immunoglobulin superfamily, lectin family, and lectin-like protein family. Today, receptors that are not located next to each other on the genome, such as the inhibitory receptor TIGIT (T cell immunoreceptor with immunglobulin and ITIM domains), the coactivating receptor DNAM1 (DNAX accessory molecule 1; also known as CD226), and the inhibitory receptor CD112R (also known as PVRIG), can also be considered to be paired receptors as they recognise the same cellular ligands (mainly the poliovirus receptor PVR), but have opposing effects (inhibition and coactivation) [19]. For the purpose of this article, we therefore define paired receptors as a pair of receptors that includes an inhibitory and a coactivating receptor; each member of the pair has at least one common cellular ligand (Table 1\n), and upon binding of this ligand, each member of the pair exerts contrasting effects (inhibition or co-stimulation) (Figure 1A). Note that paired receptors in the context of this article do not need to be functionally linked and can signal independently of each other \u2013 in other words, the inhibitory receptor does not need to directly inhibit signalling through the activating receptor.",

Although in vitro affinities may not accurately reflect the cell membrane environment in vivo, these observations suggest that under healthy, steady-state conditions, when the inhibitory receptor and coactivating receptor are expressed on the same cell bind their shared ligand, the dominant signal is most likely inhibition. This high-affinity binding of the inhibitory receptor also results in competitive binding, whereby the inhibitory receptors physically interrupt the binding of the coactivating receptors to the ligand (Figure 1B). In addition, some of the inhibitory receptors can also exert their function in a receptor-extrinsic manner. For example, the inhibitory receptor TIGIT has been shown to disrupt the homodimerisation of its binding partner DNAM1, thus interfering with the coactivating receptor function of DNAM1 (Figure 1B) [20].",

Several of the coactivating paired receptors have an ITIM sequence in the 3\u2032 untranslated region, which suggests that they may have evolved from the inhibitory receptors [18]. Indeed, because inhibitory receptors are often used by pathogens for immune evasion (as discussed below), immune cells seem to have acquired coactivating receptors later in their evolution than inhibitory receptors, to counterattack these pathogens. This model is well represented by the Ly49 paired receptors expressed on NK cells. Inhibitory Ly49 receptors recognise host MHC class I molecules, which can be downregulated on the surface of virus-infected cells, leading to NK cell activation. Mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV) therefore evades the immune response by producing viral MHC class I-like ligand m157 for inhibitory Ly49I. However, some MCMV-resistant mouse strains also express activating Ly49 receptors, which recognise m157 to directly kill MCMV-infected cells [21]. Still, even in this case it seems that the inhibitory interaction is dominant. The binding constants determined by Adams et al. using surface plasmon resonance (SPR) were KD\n = 166 nM for Ly49I/m157 interaction and KD\n = 1 \u03bcM for Ly49H/m157 interaction [22].",

For example, mast cells and eosinophils express the coactivating receptor DNAM1 [23] but not its inhibitory receptor counterpart TIGIT. Interestingly, these effector cells of allergy also express Nectin 2, which is a ligand of TIGIT and DNAM1 [23]. The expression by mast cells and eosinophils of only the coactivating receptor and its ligand means that when these cells come together there is enhanced activation, which can explain the self-fuelling, proinflammatory allergic effector unit (AEU) 23, 24. Thus, tissue-resident mast cells start the allergic response and when eosinophils penetrate into the tissue, they interact via soluble mediators and physical binding with mast cells to form the AEU. This synergistic overactivation of mast cells and eosinophils is an example of the pathology that can be \u2018lying in wait\u2019 when the paired receptors become unbalanced in certain situations.",

A well-characterised example is that of CD28 and cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen (CTLA)4; both of which bind CD80 and CD86 [6]. The activity of immature T cells is well controlled by a rigorous education process in the thymus, but the later stages of T cell activity in the periphery must be checked as well, and this is achieved by paired receptors. The coactivating receptor CD28 is expressed on na\u00efve T cells, which allows them to respond to signals presented by a dendritic cell (DC) that has sensed a pathogen. These na\u00efve T cells, however, do not yet express the inhibitory receptor CTLA4. Expression of CTLA4 by conventional T cells occurs only after TCR activation [6]. Once it is expressed, CTLA4 can inhibit T cell activity by various mechanisms, including direct signalling, competing for ligands and even \u2018grabbing\u2019 and degrading ligands from target cells [27].",

This enables T and NK cells harbouring cytolytic granules \u2013 and mast cells containing granules with proinflammatory mediators \u2013 not to harm normal tissues, but still respond quickly through the already present coactivating receptors when there is danger. The simultaneous presence of inhibitory and coactivating receptors also keeps immune cells in a responsive state that allows them to detect small variations within their environment. For example, NK cells, in the absence of MHC class I are hyporesponsive, which indicates that inhibitory receptor signalling might be involved in the education and responsiveness of NK cells [28]. It has also been proposed that chronic activating receptor signals, that are delivered in the absence of inhibition, desensitize NK cells, leading to their hyporesponsiveness, by a process referred to as disarming [29]. Thus, paired coactivating and inhibitory receptors might coexist to fine tune the response of immune cells to their environment. This ensures that under homeostatic conditions, cells remain quiescent, but still functional, and upon subtle but rapid changes in the environment (e.g., an increase in ligand density, providing additional ligands for activating receptors) these cells are able to respond efficiently. This theory is directly related to the discontinuity theory that has been postulated by Vivier and colleagues, which proposes that immune cells generate an effector response when there is a discontinuity, that is, sudden changes in antigenic stimulation, whereas they tend to become tolerant to continuously (slow or continuous stimulation) [30].",

Finally, some ligands such as phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine that are normally expressed on the cell surface following apoptosis and are recognised by CD300a and CD300c, can be upregulated, even in the absence of apoptosis, following viral infection, malignant transformation [25], and in allergic inflammation 36, 37.

The expression of shared ligands may shield the invading pathogens during the early stages of cellular infection, where they are generally more vulnerable to elimination by immune cells. In addition, the baseline immune-inhibitory property of a cell expressing shared ligands also means that there is a lag period before the cell can be tipped towards an immune-activating state (Figure 2B). This would allow the pathogen to proliferate more, reaching higher numbers and thus increasing its chances of surviving immune attack when it starts (Figure 2B). Using a shared ligand as an entry receptor ensures these benefits, and provides the pathogen with a distinct advantage in outperforming immune pressure.",

The shared ligand can bind either receptor, but the receptors themselves have opposite downstream signals, either activating or inhibitory. (B) Several mechanisms cause the inhibitory signal to be dominant over the activating signal when both paired receptors are expressed on the same cell. (B1). The inhibitory receptor (marked in red), has a higher affinity for the shared ligand than the activating receptor in all receptor pairs (for example, TIGIT versus DNAM1 8, 38). (B2) As a result of its higher affinity for ligand, the inhibitory receptor competes with its activating partner for ligand binding such that the inhibitory receptor physically interrupts the binding of the activating receptor to the ligand 8, 38. (B3) There is also evidence that inhibitory receptors can interfere with the homodimerization of their corresponding activating receptor, thereby preventing signalling through the activating receptor (e.g., TIGIT can interfere with the homodimerisation of DNAM1 [20]).

(A) Evolutionary pressure favours viruses that use the shared ligands of paired receptors as entry and/or adhesion receptors. Host cells that express a shared ligand (shown in purple) are relatively protected from immune system attack because the shared ligand sends a dominant inhibitory signal to immune cells expressing the paired inhibitory (marked in red) and coactivating (marked in black) receptors. Therefore, viruses that enter and reproduce in cells expressing a shared ligand can avoid an immune response. Virus-infected host cells that do not express a shared ligand can be killed by the immune system. (B) Invading a host cell that sends an inhibitory signal to immune cells allows pathogens more time to replicate safely. (Ba) A host cell sends no net signal to the immune system at the initiation of the pathological process (t = 0). This is true of several cell types, such as beta cells in the pancreas as well as some cells in immune privileged sites throughout the body. The time that the host cell takes to produce a signal that is sufficient to activate immune cells is termed tA. (Bb) If the host cell sends an inhibitory signal to the immune system at baseline (through its expression of a shared ligand), then the same processes that induce immune-activating signals will take longer to cross the threshold required to activate the immune system (tB > tA). This lag period (tB \u2212 tA) allows for greater viral replication and increased pathology to develop before immune intervention (blue portion of the graph). In turn, the larger viral population is more likely to survive immune attack. Onset of immunopathology is indicated by the red portion of the graph.",
