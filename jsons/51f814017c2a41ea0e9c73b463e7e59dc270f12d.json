            "text": "Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), emerged in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. On 11 March 2020, COVID-19 was declared a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO). The WHO estimates global mortality at 3.4%, 1 though mortality rates are higher among older people and those with comorbidities. A cohort of 36 non-survivors of COVID-19 in China identified the most prevalent symptoms as fever (94%), shortness of breath (58%), fatigue (47%) and cough (39%). 2 Within Europe, Italy was the first country to be seriously affected by COVID-19. The first case was identified on 21 February 2020, and by the end date of this survey, on 15 March 2020, more than 24,000 cases and 1,809 deaths were recorded in Italy. Escalating numbers of deaths are anticipated elsewhere. Palliative care is an essential component of health care in pandemics, contributing to symptom control, as well as psychological support for patients, carers and health care professionals, and supporting triage and complex decision making. 3 However, hospices may be particularly vulnerable to disruption in pandemics, and very little data exist on the response of, or impact on, palliative care services in these situations. 4 The aim of this study was to examine preparedness for, and impact of, COVID-19 on hospices in Italy. In particular, we wanted to understand the early experiences, as these may help to inform the response in other countries who were about to experience the challenges of Italy. Our research questions were as follows: We also wanted to determine any experience of COVID-19-positive patients and whether this affected their response. We explored whether hospices in areas of higher and lower of COVID-19 population prevalence led to differences in response, to see whether this appeared to lead to greater preparation in areas first to be affected and with more cases or other differences in response.",

The density of services is higher in the north of the country, including Lombardy, where the main COVID-19 outbreak began, than in the south. There is a long tradition of hospice and palliative care: the European Association for Palliative Care (EAPC) was founded in Italy in 1988. There are however few academic positions and little education in medical schools. The EAPC 2019 Atlas of Palliative Care recorded that 0 of 43 medical schools and only 98 of 222 nursing schools provided palliative care education within their undergraduate programmes. 5",

The impact of COVID-19 on care of the dying was felt to reach beyond the acute illness: 'At the end of this story, I think palliative care in Italy and everywhere will be very different from before'.",

            "text": "We provide the first data from the hospice sector of preparedness for, and impact of, COVID-19. At the time of data collection, two hospices (both in high prevalence areas) were aware of having COVID-19-positive patients or staff. However, all had implemented changes in policies in response to COVID-19, for example, concerning visitors and volunteers, and several had rapidly implemented changes in practice according to changing needs. An important concern voiced by staff was a lack of preparedness for COVID-19. While all hospices in our survey had written guidance on procedures for suspected and confirmed cases of COVID-19, this was mostly regionally or nationally provided and no hospice had setting-specific guidance. There was considerable variation in the use of barrier precautions and personal protective equipment, which were described as scarce. There was also wide variation in perceptions of anxiety and the risk of illness among staff. This may indicate that more and urgent education is needed to inform hospice staff about reducing risks of COVID-19 infection. Protection of health care professionals across all settings against COVID-19 through use of appropriate barrier precautions should be of the highest priority, to avoid illness and mitigate against psychological distress. 1 National and international guidance and evidence regarding personal protective equipment has been evolving since the start of this pandemic. A recent rapid review concluded that the best evidence was that 'Suspected or confirmed case of COVID-19 requiring healthcare facility admission and no [aerosol generating procedures] AGPs, use hand hygiene, mask, gown, goggles, gloves'. This review noted that masks are one component of protection. Aprons, gloves and eye protection should all be used with confirmed or suspected COVID, something which has been recommended but used variably across the globe. 6 Provision of holistic care in the context of an infectious disease outbreak was noted to be highly challenging. Hospices responded to this challenge through rapid changes to service provision. For example one hospice had implemented daily telephone calls to relatives who were unable to visit, which might mitigate against the 'disruption in connectedness' described following the 2003 SARS epidemic in Singapore. 7 Another hospice had moved staff from inpatient to home care services as a result of a falling number of inpatient referrals. Changes in inpatient hospice utilisation in Taiwan were identified during and after the SARS epidemic and led to recommendations to distribute hospice care services into networks (e.g. home care, acute hospital inpatient care and inpatient hospice care) that can adapt to changing needs. 4 The concern regarding palliative care for many patients who the services could not reach was a pervading theme, as seen in the other comments. The engagement of palliative care in intensive care can be complex, often because of the uncertainly in outcome and the rapidly changing situation. 8 To date, attention has focussed on tools and integrated working to support patients and families in intensive care unit (ICU). 9,10",

We chose purposive sampling as this is known to be very useful in situations when a targeted sample is needed quickly, and where sampling for proportionality is not the main concern, as in the context of rapid spread of COVID-19 and a lack of information on the hospice response. Although it would have been useful to have had a larger sample, we reached saturation of themes. However, a larger sample might have identified more examples of innovate practice. The opportunity to collect in-depth qualitative data was limited due to the extreme pressure services are under. It will be useful to follow up this cross-sectional survey over time, and with a larger sample, as the situation changes. Using our existing clinical-academic networks enabled this survey to be completed rapidly, to provide essential early data of the hospice response.",

            "text": "The hospice sector has an important role to play in the response to COVID-19. Hospices are known to provide support with complex decisions and triage, psychological support for patients, carers and professionals, and complex symptom management, particularly for people who are dying. 3 However, in our study we found that procedures had mainly focussed on the notification regarding positive COVID-19 cases, rather than on the contribution of hospices to care. There is other evidence that the hospice sector is underused in epidemics. 4 In Italy, and elsewhere, it is likely that the number of people dying with COVID-19 will overwhelm the capacity of the acute sector. 11 Integrating hospice and palliative care into the acute pandemic response may improve the care and symptom management for people who are deteriorating and at the end of life, as well as helping in the overall effort to optimise survival of others. 12 Our data highlight that hospice services in all countries need to act now to prepare for COVID-19. Building on the Critical Care model of providing surge capacity in a crisis, elements essential to implementing a palliative care pandemic plan include (a) medication and equipment for symptom control including kits for use in care homes and at home; (b) education to frontline staff on symptom management and end-of-life care including developing standardised order sheets and protocols, and involving allied care workers in providing psychological and bereavement support; (c) identification of wards and beds appropriate to accommodate patients expected to die; and (d) systems to identify patients in need of palliative care and to provide appropriate support across settings. 13",

Our survey demonstrates that the hospice sector is able to respond flexibly and rapidly to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the potential of hospices in supporting the COVID-19 pandemic will be undermined unless the sector has access to appropriate protective equipment and setting-specific guidance. Governments must urgently recognise the necessity of hospice and palliative care to the COVID-19 pandemic and ensure these services are both protected and integrated into the health care system response. Hospices may also need to reach out to offer support in creative ways during the response.",
