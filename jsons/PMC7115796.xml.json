They may invade a community and spread rapidly amongst its members, sometimes causing a large number of fatalities, possibly on a recurrent basis. In the case of the influenza virus, in 1918\u20131919 a new strain (\u201cSpanish\u201d, type H1N1) swept the globe, causing an estimated 50\u2013100 million deaths de la Barrera and Reyes-Teran, 2005, Osterholm, 2005, Strauss et al., 2006. At the present time there are several countries, particularly in Africa, with up to 35% of their populations between the ages of 15 and 50 years infected by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Throughout the world, there are currently approximately 40 million persons infected (Regoes et al., 2005) and already over 16 million deaths have been caused by this virus.",

Examples of such systems with as many as 10 components applied to analysis of vaccination against carrier borne diseases are summarized in Anderson and May (1991). The SIR approach, which is based on an assumption of homogeneous mixing of susceptible and infectious individuals, is used to make predictions in relation to both practical and theoretical aspects of epidemics and the spread of disease (see Diekmann and Heesterbeek, 2000, Hethcote, 2000, Pollard, 1973 for reviews). However, such gross compartmental models do not allow for the inclusion of either the spatial distributions of the individual members of the population nor the detailed dynamics of the infecting particles (viruses or bacteria).",

In this context, the idea of \u201csuperspreaders\u201d has been discussed in relationship to SARS (Lipsitch et al., 2003), though the emphasis was on contact rates rather than host viral-immune dynamical parameters. In previous publications Tuckwell et al., 1998, Tuckwell et al., 2000, Tuckwell et al., 2001 we have adopted this new approach to the spread of a disease using a set of dynamical variables which describe the disease states of individuals (animals or humans) through the size of the actual viral populations they harbor and components of the immune system. It is recognized that often there are many locations of viral populations in a single host, but these are considered together. We have considered a network of n>1 hosts within each of which a viral population may establish itself and such that virus particles may be transmitted from any diseased host to another host. The model we will consider places emphasis on viruses as the disease-causing agent, but our approach may be also applied to bacterial diseases.",

Generally, there are agents in the immune system which, when stimulated by antigens, give rise to host defence mechanisms which are of several types, but whose net action is to eliminate the virus. Active defense mechanisms are lumped into effectors Anderson and May, 1991, Bocharov and Romanyukha, 1994 so that a simplified two-dimensional system of effectors and virus may be considered in each individual. Since the immune responses are specific to any particular virus, the use of a system of two differential equations to model the evolution of the virus-effector populations is a simplification but this approach is expected to contain the essential dynamics of the biological processes without rendering the system of equations unwieldy with a very large parameter set. Our approach can easily incorporate the \u201cstandard model\u201d of viral dynamics in which there are three components, including uninfected T-cells, infected T-cells and virus particles (Neumann et al., 1998), or other similar models (Wodarz et al., 2002). However, this would require even more parameters so here we concentrate on the simplest comprehensive model and reserve extensions to later work. An article using our approach but with the inclusion of immunological memory has recently appeared (Kostova, 2007).",

Records of the number of recorded cases of influenza (Anon., 2006a) show major roughly periodic outbreaks, which are probably attributable in part to seasonal effects (Lloyd and Jansen, 2004), although the precise mechanisms involved are still not understood. One of the questions we wish to address in the present work concerns the nature and causes of periodic outbreaks. We wish to enquire whether \u201cepidemics\u201d may arise due to spatio-temporal stochastic processes in the transmission process. For example, if per chance a spatial cluster of diseased hosts occurs, there may ensue a local outbreak of considerable magnitude which may propagate to the rest of the population. We have already considered the effects of noise in individual responses and noted a broad-based stochastic resonance as the noise parameter changes in nonlinear models with threshold (Tuckwell et al., 2000). We wish to investigate here and in subsequent studies the factors, both demographic and dynamical, which influence the frequency, magnitude and duration of various outbreaks.",

All these parameters are nonnegative but in accordance with the most natural choice are given normal distributions (central limit theorem, Tuckwell, 1995) with means and standard deviations such that negative values have practically zero chance to occur\u2014and in fact never did occur in any of the trials we have performed. The standard values of the means and standard deviations of these five parameters are shown in Table 1\n, their units being as follows: \u03bbi, effectors days\u22121; \u03bci, days\u22121; ri, days\u22121; \u03b3i, effectors\u22121days\u22121; and \u025bi, virions\u22121days\u22121. These values are based in part on (Anderson and May, 1991) and on our previous work Tuckwell et al., 1998, Tuckwell et al., 2000, Tuckwell et al., 2001 and are such that when they assume their mean values, the solutions of (5) and (6) in response to an initial small increase in viral load, are such that the viral load rises to a maximum after a few days and then declines to negligible values after about 10 days, while the effector level rises and remains at a higher level (immune memory); that is there are no oscillations. The actual magnitudes of the maximum viral loads are known in some cases where this is the form of the viral population growth curve, e.g. influenza in man (Bocharov and Romanyukha, 1994) and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus in mice (Bocharov, 1998). In these references very complicated models (10 to over 40 differential equations) for viral and immune system dynamics have been given but we have employed a reduced system which captures the essence of the very large systems. The key variables (viral load and effector numbers) can be easily rescaled if required to actual biological values Bocharov, 1998, Bocharov and Romanyukha, 1994, Neumann et al., 1998, Sidorenko, 2005. For example, viral densities in influenza are of order 108 virus particles per millilitre of infected tissue (Sidorenko, 2005) and in lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus in mice, between 107 and 109 per millilitre (Bocharov, 1998).

In these runs, the values of the host dynamical parameters (Table 1) were the same (after being randomly generated) and the spatial distributions of the individuals were also the same (after being randomly generated). It was found that there was some variability in the response type, but often the result was stereotypical. For example, with n=30, in 8 trials of 10, there were 6 outbreaks in the period t<250 and in 2 trials there were 5 outbreaks in the same time period.

Here is plotted the number of times (in 20 trials) that only a single outbreak occurred versus population density from n=20 to n=60, with 20 trials for each value of n. These results include the four first column results of Fig. 6. When n=20 there were 15 occurrences of just one outbreak, for n=25 just 11, for n=30 there were 8, for n=35 there were 3 and for n=60, only one in 20 trials gave rise to a single outbreak. The fact that increasing n leads to a greater chance of multiple outbreaks can be traced to the effect of n on the rates of meetings for any individual which for fixed values of all other parameters are very close to proportional to n. This assertion was verified by performing several simulations with only variations in the parameter \u039b \u2014see Section 4.3 for related results. In order to understand which other factors might be primarily responsible for the occurrence of a multiplicity of outbreaks, we examined the nature of the critical points which are of the kind given in the scheme of Fig. 3. If one or more members of the population have, for the critical point P2, asymptotically stable spiral points as opposed to nodes, one might expect that there is a chance that the resulting individual oscillatory activity could manifest itself in multiple outbreaks across the entire population. That is, recurrent epidemics might arise just because one or a few individuals have immune system parameters which lead to their having recurrent illness, which enables them to transmit virus particles to to others. However, it was found that recurrent outbreaks may occur in the population when there are just a few spiral P2\u2019s or if there are many.",

With ptrans=0.4, 90% of trials gave recurrent outbreaks and when ptrans was 0.5, all of the trials performed resulted in sustained oscillatory responses, of the kind depicted in Fig. 4. For the second set of results periodic outbreaks were harder to elicit, as ptrans had to be greater than 0.4 for them to occur at all. Examination of the spatial distributions for the two sets of results showed that for the first set, the initially infected individual was near the center of mass of the population whereas for the second set the initially infected individual was isolated at the periphery. Since the greater the distance between two individuals the smaller their rate of meeting, the position of the initially infected individual may have influenced the probability of multiple periodic outbreaks.

It has been assumed that each individual has a home base and his or her interactions with other individuals occur randomly at the event times in Poisson processes whose rates depend on the distances between the home bases. The manner in which locations are chosen could make the model appropriate for certain plant populations. Small-world network effects (Weycker et al., 2005) which may occur in human populations are captured to some degree because any individual may encounter any other individual with a non-zero probability no matter how great the distance between them. As a general rule however, in human and especially animal populations, encounters are on average more likely between individuals the smaller the distance between them, as described by the present model.",

Disease particles are transmitted stochastically from infected to other individuals. The novel feature of our model is that it includes dynamical systems for within-host disease particles (viruses or bacteria) and the host immune response. This has been done in a simple way by using a system of two differential equations which captures the elements of effector-viral or effector-bacterial dynamics. With the use of such models one may distinguish more accurately the spread of various diseases by using appropriate parameters. For example, models for HIV within-host dyamics are well documented (Neumann et al., 1998) and could be used in place of the simple model ((5) and (6)) and could also be made stochastic Le Corfec and Tuckwell, 1998, Merrill, 2005.",

For the simulations we performed, values of ptrans below 0.3 never gave multiple outbreaks (see Table 4) whereas values equal to or greater than 0.5 could give multiple outbreaks. The parameter vcrit was also investigated and found to exert considerable control over the multiplicity of outbreaks with a well-defined threshold effect. Another property investigated was population density, and since the area of habitat was fixed, it was sufficient to vary the population size n. The main influence of an increase in population density is, if the parameters \u039b and \u03b1 are left unchanged, to increase the contact rates between hosts. It was found that the probability of a single outbreak, as opposed to multiple outbreaks, dropped rapidly as the population density increased. Similarly, if the parameter \u039b increased there was an increase in the likelihood of a multiple outbreak. The natures of the population critical points was found to have some influence, but contact rates seemed to be the more important of these factors: if there were a few or many P2 spiral points multiple outbreaks occurred if \u039b was large enough.",

First the mean of the intrinsic effector production rate, E[\u03bbi] was varied to just above and below its standard value. Larger E[\u03bbi] made it harder, but not impossible if \u039b increased, to elicit multiple outbreaks, reflecting stronger immune properties of the host population. Smaller values increased the likelihood of recurring illness across the population. Changes in the mean of ri, the within-host viral production rate had the opposite effects to the corresponding changes in the mean of \u03bbi. In general, the the mean values of the within-host dynamical systems parameters have been based on a restricted set of values, so it remains to be seen what epidemic behaviour other sets of values will induce. In general such parameters, or their analogues in more detailed models, will be disease-specific. This could accommodate the fact that in some diseases, such as hepatitis C and chickenpox, virus particles persist within hosts for many years. The set of values concentrated on in this paper were based on our earlier work, where non-oscillatory solutions of the differential equations were sought to avoid recurrence of disease by virtue of individual dynamics as opposed to interactive effects.",

In addition, analysis could be performed on the effects of vaccination, quarantine and host deaths.
