Therefore, development of effective vaccines against PEDV variant strains is urgently needed. Recently, it has been reported that the N-terminal domain (NTD) of S1 domain of PEDV spike protein is responsible for binding to the 5-N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac), a possible sugar co-receptor. Therefore, the NTD of S1 domain could be an attractive target for the development of subunit vaccines. In this study, the NTD spanning amino acid residues 25-229 (S25-229) of S1 domain of PEDV variant strain was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) in the form of inclusion bodies (IBs). S25-229 IBs were solubilized in 20 mM sodium acetate (pH 4.5) buffer containing 8 M urea and 1 mM dithiothreitol with 95% yield. Solubilized S25-229 IBs were refolded by 10-fold flash dilution and purified by one-step cation exchange chromatography with >95% purity and 20% yield. The CD spectrum of S25-229 showed the characteristic pattern of alpha helical structure. In an indirect ELISA, purified S25-229 showed strong reactivity with mouse anti-PEDV sera. In addition, immunization of mice with 20 mg of purified S25-229 elicited highly potent serum IgG titers. Finally, mouse antisera against S25-229 showed immune reactivity with native PEDV S protein in an immunofluorescence assay. These results suggest that purified S25-229 may have potential to be used as a subunit vaccine against PEDV variant strains.",

The virus has an approximately 28 kb in length, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA genome with a 5 0 cap and a 3 0 polyadenylated tail [14] . The virus possesses four structural proteins including 150e220 kDa spike (S) glycoprotein, 7 kDa envelope protein, 20e30 kDa membrane protein and 58 kDa nucleocapsid proteins [15] . The PEDV S protein is a type I transmembrane glycoprotein which can be divided into S1 (aa 1-789) and S2 (aa 790-1383) domains [16] . The former is responsible for the cellular receptor binding and the latter is required for membrane fusion of the virus [17] . It has been reported that the C-terminal domain of S1 domain is responsible for binding to the porcine aminopeptidase N (pAPN), a functional cellular receptor for PEDV entry [18] . Furthermore, previous studies have also elucidated that like some of the other coronaviruses, the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the S1 domain could bind to the 5-N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac), a possible sugar co-receptor for PEDV [19] .",

Subsequently, it has been confirmed that the PEDV CHGD-01 variant strain exhibits stronger sugar-binding activity than the CV777 prototype strain, suggesting that the mutated amino acids may participate in sugar binding, and the authors also proposed that the enhanced sugar-binding activity of the variant strains may be responsible for the recent PED outbreaks [19] .

However, recombinant protein overexpression in E. coli often leads to the insoluble aggregates known as inclusion bodies (IBs). Although IBs generally consist of biologically inactive proteins, correctly folded soluble proteins can be obtained from IBs by complete denaturation followed by refolding in vitro [26] . The purified IBs are commonly solubilized by high concentration of chaotropic agents such as 6 M guanidine hydrochloride or 8 M urea, and refolding of the solubilized protein is initiated by removal of denaturants either by dialysis or dilution [27] .

Cells were lysed by sonication and centrifuged at 14,000 rpm for 5 min at 4 C. The supernatant and pellet were collected separately. The pellet was dissolved in alkaline buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 12.5), and protein samples were separated by SDS-PAGE comprising 15% separating gel and 5% stacking gel. Gels were stained with Coomassie brilliant blue R250 solution, and recombinant protein was detected by immunoblotting. Briefly, after transferring the proteins to nitrocellulose membrane, blocking was performed with 5% skimmed milk for 1 h at room temperature. The recombinant protein was probed with anti-His monoclonal antibody (Abcam, UK) in TBST (TBS containing 0.1% Tween 20) at 1: 1000 dilution. The HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG secondary antibody (Santa Cruz, USA) was used at 1: 5000 dilution. Detection was carried out using an ECL detection kit (GE Healthcare, Sweden).",

However, unlike previous study, the recombinant S25-229 with a molecular mass of~24 kDa was mainly observed within the insoluble fractions in both noninduced and induced cells (Fig. 1A, lane 2 and 4) . Various IPTG concentrations, induction temperatures as low as 23 C, and induction timings were tested, but did not affect the insoluble nature of S25-229 (data not shown). Approximately 30% of the total cell protein was S25-229. The expressed recombinant S25-229 was detected by western blot using an anti-His monoclonal antibody (Fig. 1B) . In addition, western blot result showed an extra band of 50 kDa within the insoluble fractions, which suggests the formation of dimers of S25-229 (Fig. 1B, dotted arrow) .

In this study, 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) buffer containing 8 M urea was initially used to solubilize the S25-229 IBs, but the solubilization efficiency was only 21% even in the presence of 8 M urea (Table 1 ). It has been reported that solubilization of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) IBs was pH-dependent even in the presence of 8 M urea [29] . Therefore, we decided to check the role of pH on the solubilization efficiency of S25-229 IBs. As the theoretical isoelectric point (pI) of S25-229 was determined as 8.87, optimization experiments were carried out using solubilization buffers with pH values of <7.5. As shown in Table 1 , the solubilization efficiency was improved from 21% to 81% as pH lowered from 7.5 to 4.5.",

In this study, refolded S25-229 was purified by strong cation exchange chromatography using HiTrap SP FF column on a FPLC \u20ac AKTA explorer 10 chromatography system ( Fig. 2A) .

The ELISA result showed that S25-229 elicited strong humoral immune response after second injection (Fig. 5) .

Because our attempt to solubilize purified S25-229 IBs in 20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) buffer containing 8 M urea showed low solubilization efficiency, the solubilization condition was further optimized. We found that lowering the pH and adding reducing agent were helpful to improve the solubilization efficiency. Subsequently, solubilized S25-229 IBs were refolded by simple dilution method. Refolded S25-229 was purified by one-step cation exchange chromatography with >95% purity and 20% yield. The CD spectrum of S25-229 showed the characteristic pattern of alpha helical structure. In an indirect ELISA, purified S25-229 showed strong reactivity with mouse anti-PEDV sera. In addition, immunization of mice with 20 mg of purified S25-229 elicited highly potent serum IgG titers. Finally, mouse antisera against S25-229 showed immune reactivity with native S protein of PEDV in an immunofluorescence assay. The results suggest that purified S25-229 may have potential to be used as a subunit vaccine for the prevention of PEDV. Moreover, the method presented in this work provides an easy way to produce soluble recombinant S25-229 from bacterial IBs. ",
