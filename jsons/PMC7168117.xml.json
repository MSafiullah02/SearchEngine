The Cox model included no covariates, as no significant differences in patient characteristics were found. Survival times were censored at the age of 5 years if the event did not occur earlier.

However, the level of rhinovirus genome load at study entry modified the effect of prednisolone in terms of the time to initiation of asthma control medication (rhinovirus load x study drug interaction, P=.04, Figure 3). In children with a rhinovirus genome load of >7000 copies/mL, the risk for initiation of asthma control medication was lower in the prednisolone group (n=14) compared to the placebo group (n=9; hazard ratio [HR] 0.38; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.14\u20101.01, P=.05, Figure 3).

By contrast, the RCT of Vinku2 did quantify virus genomic load; in an earlier analysis, we report that prednisolone treatment reduced the recurrence of wheezing in a group of children with a rhinovirus genome load of >7000 copies/mL in a 12\u2010month follow\u2010up.9 Our current 4\u2010year results are in line with these previous findings and support the view that the risk of asthma can be reduced when high\u2010risk children are identified early and treated with OCS. OCS is likely to downregulate asthma\u2010associated inflammatory pathways by decreasing the transcription of many inflammatory genes and/or their transcription factors and increasing the expression of various anti\u2010inflammatory genes.4, 23 Furthermore, starting the acute care early may be important, as rhinovirus load peaks early in infection.24\n",

The sample size was small but large enough to generate statistically significant results consistent with our previous studies.8, 9 Most patients were hospitalized which raises questions about the generalizability of our results to outpatients or mild wheezing illness.27 Rhinovirus diagnostics caused a delay in administration of the study drug which could have contributed to the lack of effectiveness of prednisolone in overall rhinovirus analysis (in addition to more sensitive PCR). In our earlier post hoc analysis with no delay in initiation of study drug and no quantitative rhinovirus detection, prednisolone was found effective in all children with rhinovirus and/or eczema.8, 28 The inflammatory profiling of T helper 1 and T helper 2 mediators in different subgroups would increase the interest of our findings but we did not do the profiling. Moreover, there were many cutoff levels of rhinovirus genome load with significant P\u2010value. In this study, we made a decision to be in line with the earlier follow\u2010up.9\n",
