We proceed by asking the same questions in regard to episodes in hospitals caring for filovirus hemorrhagic fever patients. Then we beg the same questions in regard to what we know about the viruses and the infections they cause (in cell cultures, in experimental animals, in humans). We extend the perspective to the ecological and epidemiological characteristics of filovirus infections, and further extend this to recent field studies aimed at finding the reservoir host(s). Then we move on to a synthesis of the principles underpinning the natural history of zoonotic viruses and how they may apply to the filoviruses specifically. Finally, from an international public health perspective, we restate why we regard the filoviruses with such suspicion and why we think certain research and resources are needed to meet present international public health needs.",

            "text": "The virus family Filoviridae only became known to medical science in 1967, although there has been speculation that the viruses have been around for at least as long as to have caused one of the plagues of Athens (Olson et al., 1996) . In 1967, African green monkeys (Cercopithecus aethiops) brought Marburg virus from Africa to Europe, resulting in 31 human cases (including six secondary cases) and seven deaths among workers handling the monkeys or their tissues (Siegert et al., 1967) ; Smith et al., 1967; Kissling et al., 1968 Kissling et al., , 1970 Simpson, 1970; Martini and Siegert, 1971) . Zoonotic transmission occurred in circumstances where there was very close contact between the monkeys and the humans. Monkeys were handled without substantial biocontainment equipment or practices; removal of kidneys and handling of cell cultures prepared from them was done with only rudimentary protocols to prevent bacterial contamination. In reviewing events before the point of zoonotic transmission, it was realized that many of the monkeys recently shipped from Uganda had died of a hemorrhagic disease. However, no specific antibodies were found in sera from monkeys subsequently captured in Uganda in the area where the monkeys had originated, and the source of the virus remains unknown. Because in later studies, all African green monkeys experimentally inoculated with the virus died acutely, it was postulated that monkeys might not be involved in the Marburg virus reservoir host cycle in nature. It was also apparent that the capacity of the virus for human-to-human spread was likely limited; this was evidenced by the low secondary attack rate among the many people exposed and the absence of tertiary cases. In fact, the human disease disappeared once the monkeys were eliminated. Since 1967, Marburg virus has reappeared only a few times, in Africa, in limited circumstances (Gear et al., 1975; Conrad et al., 1978; Smith et al., 1982; Johnson et al., 1996) (Table I) .",

However, attempts to backtrack from the implicated primates in these episodes have also failed to reveal a true reservoir host. In these episodes, most investigators have surmised that the nonhuman primates involved likely became infected from the same still mysterious reservoir host(s) that in other episodes seem to have exposed humans directly. This notion follows also from some evidence that transmission of filoviruses from monkey to monkey is not very efficient and that close contact among monkeys is needed to accomplish transmission just as it is in humans (e.g., antibody was not found in free-living chimpanzees in contact with those that died in the Tai\" Forest, C6te d 'Ivoire, in 1994) . Further, this notion is consistent with the fact that the monkey species which have been studied experimentally have been far too susceptible to the lethal consequences of infection, and too likely to quickly burn out as host populations, to be able to perpetuate the viruses in nature over the long course. At a minimum, if a particular species of monkey were the reservoir host of Ebola virus, one would expect evidence of mortality such as seen with yellow fever in howler monkeys in the rain forests of Central and South America.",

These circumstances, of course, remind one of typical arthropod-borne and rodent-borne virus transmission cycles, with their annual periodicity and longer secular trends.

Indeed, Marburg and Ebola viruses are so very different from one another and the four recognized subtypes of Ebola virus are different enough from one another that we should consider each independently in regard to possible reservoirs and probable evolutionary pressures .

It has been said that this is just a matter of increasing recognition of human cases because of publicity, rather than a true emergence phenomenon. However, it seems more likely that epidemics such as that in Kikwit, Zaire, in 1995 would not have been overlooked earlier and that there really is an increasing incidence (CDC, 1995a-c; WHO, 1995a-d; Peters, 1996a) . Because the reservoir host(s) is not known, ecological, environmental, and human behavioral changes that might have increased the opportunities for emergence in recent years are still matters of speculation, matters needing more study. Nevertheless, observations in these recent outbreak settings are all we have, so we must proceed from this point. One question in this regard is whether we should focus our attention on urban human-to-human transmission episodes (with particular focus on tracking back to index cases) or orient all research enterprise on the feral niche(s) where the viruses are perpetuated independently of human involvement.",

The terrible consequences that can follow such indifference are clear, yet this is a separate matter from the circumstance that brings the first human case, the index case, from the remote site of zoonotic exposure to the crowded sites of human-tohuman transmission, starting in the caregiving family, proceeding to the hospital, and then extending to the community at large.",

However, this remains to be seen. Some investigators have suggested that as early as I year after the epidemic, behaviors and practices had reverted to usual ways (Khan et al., 1996) . This is especially distressing because experiences in Kikwit in 1995 provided such a good test of the concept that simple sanitary measures, strict barrier-nursing practices, and patient isolation could suffice to (a) terminate the viral transmission chain, (b) provide health care provider safety, and (c) provide adequate patient care.",

It should be noted that during the epidemic in Kikwit, strict barrier-nursing precautions included the use of a double gown (with impervious plastic lining), double gloves, boots, goggles, and mask (usually a HEPA-filtered mask) (Peters et al., 1991b; CDC, 1995d; CDC/NIH, 1993) . The view that adequate hygiene, strict barrier-nursing practices, and patient isolation can limit the spread of Ebola virus to medical staff is also supported by the experience in Mayibout, Gabon, in 1996, where 32 patients were cared for without any infections in medical staff (LeGuenno, 1996) .",

However, as characterization work proceeded and as genomic sequencing was initiated, it became clear that the viruses deserved the formation of a new family, the family Filoviridae Kiley et al., 1982 Kiley et al., , 1988 . Later, when it was realized that the member viruses of the family Filoviridae exhibit phylogenetic characters (conserved domains in nucleoprotein and polymerase genes) in common with members of the families Rbabdoviridae and Paramyxoviridae, the three families were brought together in the order Mononegavirales (Muhlberger et al., 1992; Murphy et al., 1995) . The similarities in these viruses that led to these taxonomic constructions suggest the possibility that more tractable, less hazardous substitute viruses might be chosen as stalking horses in searching for antiviral compounds and cytokines. Indeed, both vesicular stomatitis virus and respiratory synctial virus have been used to identify compounds active against Ebola virus (Huggins et al., 1996) . The finding of compounds effective against Ebola virus and respiratory synctial virus is particularly intriguing: the importance of the latter as a pediatric pathogen throughout the world might favor the commitment of the financial resources needed to bring development of candidate compounds to commercial reality. Given the minimal activity of the only three therapeutic modalities that have been tried so far, namely, hyperimmune horse serum, convalescent human plasma (and whole blood), and interferon-~, antiviral drug development is a high priority.",

Such genomic stability and the phenotypic (serotypic, pathotypic, geotypic) stability that follows on it, has typified wild-type measles virus isolates over the years and street rabies virus isolates from particular reservoir host niches (e.g., raccoons throughout the eastern United States). The Darwinian stabilizing influences operating here are not really understood but must involve constraints on multigenic viral replicative functions as well as constancy in environmental selective pressures (Holland, 1993) . The degree of this genomic stability was made strikingly evident when isolates from the epidemic in Kikwit, Zaire, 1995, were compared with those from Yambuku, Zaire, 1976, and from several sites in Gabon, 1996 (sequences of glycoprotein genes of isolates from these disparate sources differed by less than 1.5%; Sanchez et al., 1996; Georges Courbot et al., 1997a,b; Amblard et al., 1997; Nichol and Ksiazek, 1997) .",

That is, these differences make it clear that a common source human-to-human transmission chain extending across sub-Saharan Africa is not the case. Only in epidemics does a single invariant viral genotype occur. Again, this observation suggests that we will have to investigate every Ebola virus emergence individually, building, we hope, on clues gathered in the first sites, such as the Ta~ Forest in C6te d'Ivoire, to be studied in comprehensive fashion (Formenty et al., 1996; LeGuenno, 1996) .",

However, there is much more to acquiring a new phenotype than the incorporation of the occasional polymerase error. The probability that a random polymerase error will result in a new Ebola virus phenotype, say, a virus that is regularly transmitted by aerosol from severe respiratory tract infection, must be small given the amount of human disease seen to date without emergence of such a virus. It is difficult to assess whether it could happen at all, given our rudimentary understanding of the Ebola genome, the small amount of experimental work done on the whole question of aerosol transmissibility, and the early stages of our explanation of the significance of the quasi-species concept for pathogenesis and evolution of RNA viruses.

Although there are several dramatic and often-discussed correlations between viral growth in cell culture and in vivo, these have often been misleading. The one generalization that has most often proved true is that viruses which fail repeatedly to grow in cell cultures from certain hosts usually do not infect the same hosts in vivo.

As in other successful infections, the filoviruses have the capability to adapt to experimental animal species with which they have not likely had experience in nature. They are successful in gaining entry, escaping innate resistance factors, finding receptors on specific cells in several organs, finding routes and cellular substrates for systemic infection, overcoming acquired resistance factors such as the host immune response, and assuring shedding and continuation of the virus life cycle. As is the case in human infection, it must be that within this complex systemic pattern of infection, the filoviruses outmaneuver the specific host defense mechanisms of experimental animals by (a) their speed, as animals often die before it might be expected that an effective primary specific inflammatory/immune response would be elicited, and (b) their tropism(s), as the early reticuloendothelial and lymphoid tropisms likely minimize the response that might be elicited otherwise.",

Most species of bats are migratory and so could account for the seasonality of Ebola virus appearances, and several other member viruses of the order Mononegavirales have bats as a primary or secondary reservoir host (e.g., rabies and other lyssaviruses such as the newly identified Australian bat lyssavirus; several other rhabdoviruses such as Mt.

Capacity of the virus to be shed quickly: Some successful pathogens grow quickly, as noted above, but have other mechanisms that increase shedding (e.g., rotaviruses, other enteric viruses, many respiratory viruses). Efficient shedding may be favored by short-lived clinical/physiological qualities of infection, such as diarrhea or productive coughing with catarrh. The filoviruses are shed quickly, but seemingly not in specifically produced body fluids (although in the setting of the primate quarantine facility where the Reston subtype of Ebola virus emerged, spread via respiratory secretions/excretions seems to have represented an exception). All in all, is it reasonable to predict that filoviruses do not employ in nature life cycles like those of the diarrhea viruses or the strict respiratory viruses?",

            "text": "4. Capacity of the virus to replicate in certain key tissues that favor transmission: Many successful pathogens employ specific tissues for shedding; for example, many poxviruses, although causing multiorgan systemic infection, are transmitted only after infecting skin epithelium, where they cause a virusladen exanthem which is infectious by contact or by fomite (even in some cases by mechanical carriage by arthropods). Rabies virus, although neurotropic through most of its infection path, is transmitted in nature via virus shed from salivary gland epithelium. Human immunodeficiency virus (HW), also systemic in its infection pattern, is quite lymphoreticular in its tropism, but transmission nearly always involves sexual contact or blood contact (sharing needles among intravenous drug users, blood contagion at birth, formerly blood transfusion and certain blood products). In humans and experimentally infected monkeys, the filoviruses are shed from the respiratory tract, skin, and mucous membranes, and especially from blood and blood-contaminated body fluids. Transmission has only occurred via close contact except in the unusual circumstances in monkey quarantine facilities where aerosol transmission has been evident (Peters et al., 1991a,b; Jaax et al., 1995) . Do these comparisons point to filovirus transmission in nature only by close contact? Do they point away from transmission involving unusually restricted sites such as salivary glands? Do they point to a separation between major sites of virus replication and sites of virus shedding? 5. Capacity of the virus to be shed even in the face of rising host immunity: The capacity for viral shedding follows on the capacity of certain viruses to evade host defenses and establish persistent infection. This characteristic is related to the capacity of certain viruses to be transmitted congenitally and others to be shed chronically. Often this pattern of infection involves a particular immunopathological interaction of the virus and the host immune system, and often it involves a sequestration of infection in immunologically privileged tissue sites, such as the kidney, salivary glands, and sexual organs. Often this pattern of infection is unique to one (usually the reservoir) but not all host species. The long-term shedding of arenaviruses and hantaviruses in reservoir host urine and saliva, as contrasted with the acute, self-limiting course of infection, with modest, short-lived shedding in humans, is exemplary. The recrudescent shedding of herpesviruses from ganglionic neurons and the long-term shedding of hepatitis B and C viruses by carriers are also models. The filoviruses do not seem to fit this category: in humans, nonhuman primates, and in all other experimental animals that have been studied, no persistent infection has been found. Thus, unless the behavior of the filoviruses in their reservoir host(s) is quite different, this would not seem to be a priority issue for immediate research.",

Capacity of the virus to survive after being shed: Viral survival after shedding is usually an intrinsic quality of the virion, pertaining to its resistance to heat and other physical insults, solvents and other chemical insults, irradiation, etc. The range in environmental stability/instability among all human pathogenic viruses is very wide, indeed. Many but not all viruses that employ the fecal-oral transmission cycle are intrinsically \"tough\" (e.g., polioviruses, parvoviruses, and reoviruses are very resistant to environmental insults, whereas coronaviruses and toroviruses are not); many but not all viruses that are transmitted by the respiratory route or by other direct means are \"fragile\" (e.g., rhinoviruses, caliciviruses, and adenoviruses are rather resistant, whereas orthomyxoviruses, paramyxoviruses, and morbilliviruses are not). Further, most hepatitis viruses are rather \"tough,\" having first to resist degradation in the intestine, and most arthropod-borne viruses are \"fragile,\" never having to survive outside their vertebrate and arthropod hosts. Here, further information is needed about filovirus environmental stability. Anecdotes about Ebola virus surviving for months in blood at ambient temperature in the Kikwit hospital must be supported by controlled laboratory study. The evidence that we do have indicates that the filoviruses are rather average in stability (Cheprunov et al., 1995; Belanov et al., 1996) . That is, the filoviruses are stable enough to represent the particular risk that has been evident in nosocomial contact transmission episodes and contaminated needle transmission episodes (even when syringe and needle have been held at room temperature for some time), but not enough to represent risk of remote environmental spread. The latter point is complemented by the knowledge that viruses which are most like the filoviruses (i.e., the member viruses of the order Mononegavirales) are not transmitted in nature via cycles involving long-term survival outside their host(s).",

            "text": "Filovirus index cases have often occurred in the tropical rainy season. Ebola hemorrhagic fever episodes in Zaire, Sudan, C6te d'Ivoire, and Gabon have all occurred in or near the end of the rainy season, and all have been associated with tropical forest or the marginal zone between tropical forest and savanna. On the one hand, this puts the search for the viruses in the most biologically diverse of all econiches, but, on the other hand, this at least narrows the search area somewhat. In this location, many reservoir host candidates exhibit seasonality in behavior (seasonal breeding, migration, contact with humans or nonhuman primates and other normal behaviors). Going further, this location may also point to reservoir host candidates with multiyear seasonal behavioral patterns. Does seasonality or multiyear seasonality of filovirus disease episodes point to arthropods? Are the most likely candidates arthropods that are capable of becoming infected and amplifying virus? True arboviruses exhibit marked seasonality in their distribution as evidenced by the distribution of virus in arthropod populations and by the distribution of disease in humans or domestic animals. Are the most likely reservoir candidates rodents, which exhibit marked seasonal breeding and feeding habits and which exhibit multiyear population and behavior differences because of varying food supplies? Are the most likely candidates bats or other seasonally migrating species? Or are the most likely candidates species that exhibit seasonal or multiyear seasonal variations that we do not even know about or recognize as significant in the context at hand? Further, it must be recognized that within the ecosystems under considera-tion, the tropical rain forest and bordering savanna, there is great microniche isolation and ecological insularity; that is, there are many, many sites within larger geographical areas in which the filoviruses may invisibly coexist with their reservoir host(s). Many such econiches have never been examined in regard to any virological question, many may not even be known or defined at all. For example, when arbovirologists first studied the tropical rain forests of Africa and South America (Downs, 1973) , it was not even understood that the forest canopy, the under-canopy, and each lower level down to ground level each represented a distinct, isolated econiche, each niche filled with different mosquitoes and with different mosquito-borne viruses. It took years of study just to begin to understand the complexity of these econiches. The real question here will be how to simplify the study of tropical rain forest and savanna ecosystems in a way practical enough to fit in with the limited global budget for filovirus field research. Retrospective ecological studies have been performed at varying time intervals after most of the known filovirus outbreaks, but these studies have been limited when compared to studies of arbovirus ecosystems in tropical forests, as noted above. These classic studies, led in Brazil and Nigeria by O. R. and C. E. Causey and colleagues, as part of the Rockefeller Foundation Virus Program which ran from 1951 to 1970, depended on long-term staffing of field stations on site, with backup from a world-class reference laboratory, the Yale Arbovirus Research Unit, which later became the WHO World Reference Center for Arboviruses (Downs, 1973) . The field programs in Brazil and Nigeria led to the identification of more than 100 new arboviruses and defined many of their reservoirs. In contrast, filovirus field studies have been carried out only through brief one-time expeditions to sites where human exposure had occurred, and even then such expeditions have usually been delayed until months or even years after human or nonhuman primate disease episodes. Given the very small number of filovirus field expeditions, their limited scope and scale, and their very narrow focus (i.e., to find one virus), it seems no wonder that there has been so little success. In this regard, the ongoing studies in the Ta~ Forest in C6te d'Ivoire become extremely important.",

The point is that such infectious agents have adapted and have developed probably unique counters to their seemingly high risk of extinction. Considering the filovirus reservoir host(s), this premise also promises a most difficult search strategy. Here, we would focus on common animal and arthropod species, again also considering the possibility of focal distribution of virus within any overall species distribution and again considering the influence of subspeciation, genotypic variation, and topotype variation.

For example, many species represent nearly dead-end hosts for rabies virus. Hantaviruses, although often infecting a substantial proportion of their reservoir rodent host populations, cause few human infections because of the behavior of these rodents (e.g., Peromyscus maniculatus, the reservoir host of Sin Nombre virus, the etiologic agent of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, presents risk of human infection when it enters houses seasonally, whereas Clethrionomys spp., the reservoir hosts of Puumala virus, the etiologic agent of nephropathia epidemica in Scandinavia, causes human infection rarely because of its reclusive habits). Eastern equine encephalitis virus, although common in its wild bird niche in parts of eastern United States, only rarely causes human disease because of the feeding habits of its mosquito hosts.

Until recently, unfortunately, candidate confirmatory tests have not proved particularly useful: (a) western blot test results have been ambiguous; (b) no viral hemagglutinin has been detected, so there can be no hemagglutination-inhibition test; and (c) very little or no neutralization by convalescent serum has been identified, so there can be no viral neutralization test.",

This ELISA is relatively simple to use; it is based on inactivated infected cell lysate as antigen and employs an essential negative control antigen test for every serum specimen tested. Serosurveys, employing this ELISA, carried out on patients, contacts of patients, and others in Kikwit in 1995 indicated an extremely low prevalence of antibodies, affirming that human infections are usually symptomatic. This test has been evaluated for specificity and sensitivity: it has been concordant with virus isolation results when used on sera from humans and monkeys known to have been infected with filoviruses, and it has been negative when used on sera from thousands of humans and monkeys from areas of North America where there never has been any evidence of the presence of a filovirus. Among the latter sera there were some that were reactive by the IFA test, but none exhibited ELISA reactivity. Seropositivity using this ELISA has also been shown to be maintained for a long period after infection: in a small number of human sera collected more than 10 years after infection, antibody has been detectable, whereas IFA results have been equivocal or negative.",

It is argued that it is in such sites where the reservoir host(s) must participate in a transmission cycle, whether this involves direct contact transmission, fomite tranmission, arthropod transmission, or whatever. It is argued that vertebrates should be the primary focus of the search; vertebrates might at least serve as sentinels, providing evidence of past experience with the virus(es) by the presence of antibody. It is argued that vertebrates, specifically mammals, are the most likely reservoir hosts, based on results of infection of experimental animals and cultured mammalian cells. It is further argued that arboreal species should be considered leading candidate reservoir hosts, given the recent finding of a dead, Ebola-infected red colobus monkey in the Tai Forest, C6te d'Ivoire, in association with disease in chimpanzees (Formenty et al., 1996; ProMED Internet news item, dated 16 November 1996) . Finally, it is argued that migratory bats should be considered important candidate reservoir hosts. There have been anecdotes involving bats in several filovirus disease episodes, and, even though bats are common in tropical Africa, these clues must be followed up. Further, the involvement of bats in the natural history of some of the viruses most closely related to the filoviruses (i.e., some member viruses of the order Mononegavirales), along with the capacity of bats to sustain some viral infections for inordinately long periods, adds modest credibility to their candidacy. We believe that in pur-suing such candidates, sound hypotheses must be established and explored. A sound work plan must be set up and followed so that when initial hypotheses are rejected there is a clear course of action to test the next in priority order. A proper shared information system is crucial in this regard, given the diversity of field projects to be undertaken and the geographic separation of scientists from different institutions from several different countries. The publication of all results will be essential if we are to be able to profit from experiences and findings, even if findings are negative.",

These searches span critical ecological zones such as primary and secondary forest as well as savanna; however, there is a concentration on the rain forest zone because of the evidence mentioned above. As noted above, it has been decided that mammals should be the primary focus of the collections. However, not to be \"too smart\" about predicting a mammalian reservoir host(s), the investigators are testing any vertebrates that enter traps and are also testing some market animals obtained in nearby towns.

There was no clear choice. In favor of an immediate initiation of the studies was the well-known propensity for most zoonotic viruses to be transmitted intensively only at infrequent intervals; after all, the discovery and last known activity of Ebola virus in Africa had been in 1976-1979. There was always the possibility that a chronically infected reservoir host might still be present or some anomaly of animal species distribution might be noticed. Because most species in the rain forest live less than I year immediate action represented the best opportunity to detect the presence of antibodies in sentinel species. Against collecting at that time was the suggestion of rainy season proclivities of Ebola transmission and the likelihood of missing migratory species, intermittently active and short-lived arthropods, or other temporally unique opportunities. Logistics and politics also led to the decision to start immediately, in the dry season: the Zairian political climate was becoming more fragile, the cooperation of the local people was waning, the willingness of other institutions to collaborate was fleeting, the availability of funding was limited to the immediate accounting period, and, most importantly, the investigators hoped to do their work without the ensnaring mud and disruptive tropical downpours of the rainy season. The downside of this decision was addressed by more limited studies done during the next rainy season with a concentration at that time on migratory bats, unexpected species, and certain arthropods.",

This development coincided with increasing domestication of sheep, goats, and cattle, which carry viruses considered to be the progenitors of human mea-sles virus (sheep and goats: peste-des-petits-ruminants virus; cattle: rinderpest virus).",

The new megacities of Africa and other tropical zones of the world may provide such new niches for the emergence of new variant viruses and other infectious agents. Modern air transportation could deliver a new pathogen to any other megacity in the world in hours. Further, we might speculate that the most dangerous new, emerging viral disease would be one that is spread by the airborne route (Mims, 1991) . This notion follows on the concept of \"The Ultimate Pathogen\" (Kilbourne, 1983 (Kilbourne, , 1996 . Diseases transmitted by the respiratory route, such as influenza, have proved to be very difficult to control, partly because of their rapid spread. This notion as it pertains to filovirus diseases has certainly been brought to the attention of the public by the press/media; even so, it must be dealt with by appropriate research. We know that Ebola virus has the capacity to invade the lung and to replicate very productively there. We suspect that invasion of lung comes late in course of infection in humans and evokes too little cough to generate an effective aerosol. However, we do not know whether this character of the infection might change in the future, with mutations favoring aerosol transmission being fixed through Darwinian selective forces.",

There is a need to understand these viruses and the diseases they cause just because the risk they represent is unknown and the risk of future episodes is so unpredictable. This judgment takes nothing away from our need to understand the more common infectious agents and diseases of the tropics as well. We must not lose sight of the need to develop a knowledge base for all dangerous pathogens, particularly where the benefit from a small investment in epidemiological and laboratory research is likely to be so great. For example, we need to find the natural reservoir of the filoviruses and learn how their prevalence in the environment is regulated. We need to find out how transmission of these viruses to humans is regulated. In Africa, the emergence of Ebola virus could dramatically increase if the unknown reservoir increased in numbers, if it changed its behavior, or if ecological factors brought additional reservoir hosts into play. We need to know enough to anticipate such changes and to intervene rapidly should they occur.",

Present conditions of hygiene and sanitary management and the paucity of medical care and disease surveillance will continue, and they will continue to present risks of new infectious disease emergence. As westernstyle hospitals become more affordable for Africans, nosocomial Ebola amplification will increase.

Even if we say that we live in a global community and that there is a possibility that air travel could bring Ebola virus to our doorstep, quickly, what is the worst that might happen? If the worst that might happen is an occasional importation resulting in a small cluster of cases, possibly involving medical staff, should we be concerned? If such episodes are unpredictable in time and place, should we not just wait and react after the fact? Of course, the answer to such questions lies in past experiences: the same questions were asked when acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) first appeared in Los Angeles and New York, and the waitand-see answer did not serve our society well at all. One of the poorly understood findings from the Kikwit epidemic was that some Ebola patients were much more dangerous than others. Two individual patients were the cause of more than 50 contact cases (Khan et al., 1996) . We do not think that the concerned public would be satisfied if its public health leaders decided on a waitand-see approach for dealing with Ebola or the other diseases with similar epidemic potential.",

In particular, this enterprise must be built on a more substantial research base, and this in turn requires adequate trained staff and laboratory facilities for work on the BSL 4 pathogens (CDC/NIH, 1993) . Safe, productive research demands a core of trained, career scientists with knowledge of the pathogens and procedures to work with them, and these persons are not created in a short didactic course or readily carried over directly from other fields; indeed, there is underutilized BSL 4 research space in the United States. The nature and extent of present disease risks are such that present facilities around the world cannot support an appropriate scope and scale of urgently needed research work. Greater high containment laboratory capacity is urgently needed, along with funding to allow experts from academic institutions to collaborate with colleagues in government agencies in the needed work.
