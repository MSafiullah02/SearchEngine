            "text": "UPS is responsible for most regulated proteolytic events, and depends on the 76-mer protein ubiquitin (UBQ) [3], [4]. UBQ is a stable, compact protein with the six C-terminus amino acids (AAs) arranged as a flexible tail [4]. A first UBQ molecule is anchored to the \u025b-NH2 group of a Lys residue in the substrate proteins through an isopeptide bond involving the C-terminus of UBQ. Mono-ubiquitination may target a specific Lys residue [5], or a domain [6] on the substrate protein. Multiple mono- ubiquitination on different Lys residues of the substrate protein (multi- mono-ubiquitination) is also observed [7]. Ubiquitinated proteins are usually tagged with polyUBQ chains. UBQ chain elongation implies the formation of an isopeptide bond between one of seven Lys residues (K6, K11, K27, K29, K33, K48, and K63), or between the Met1 residue of a substrate-anchored proximal UBQ molecule and the C-terminus of a free, distal UBQ protein. Different UBQ chain elongation enzymes bind to interaction surfaces on UBQ with diverse specificities, and promote UBQ elongation on a specific anchoring point.",

The combinations of UBQ codes easily match the experimental observation of thousands of UBQ-labeled protein substrates on multiple sites, and ensure an exquisitely specific UBQ/UPS-dependent regulation of the functions reconducible to ubiquitinated proteins.

            "text": "UBQ is activated by two UBQ-activating (E1) enzymes through the formation of a high energy Cys\u2013UBQ thioester bond [15], [16]. E1 enzymes are relieved of their UBQ cargo by \u224840 UBQ-conjugating (E2) enzymes through a trans-thiolation reaction [17]. E2 enzymes contain a highly conserved 150\u2013200 AA UBQ-conjugating (UBC) catalytic fold that acts as a scaffold for E1 enzymes, E3 UBQ ligases, and activated UBQ [18]. More than 600 E3 ligases receive UBQ from E2 enzymes and transfer it to substrates through three main mechanisms [19]. Really interesting new gene (RING) E3 ligases directly transfer UBQ from E2\u2013UBQ complexes to RING E3-bound protein substrates [20]. Homologous to the E6AP carboxyl terminus (HECT) E3 ligases first bind UBQ onto a Cys residue of the HECT domain and release E2 enzymes, then bind protein substrates and transfer UBQ to them [21]. RING-in-between-RING (RBR) E3 ligases [22] act through a RING/HECT hybrid mechanism. Mono- and polyUBQ chains can be disassembled by a \u2248100-membered class of isopeptide-specific deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) [23] that are essential to ensure proper processing of ubiquitinated proteins. Finally, the 26S proteasome complex is the protein degradation terminal for UBQ-tagged proteins in eukaryotes [24]. It is made by a 20S barrel-shaped catalytic core particle (CP) composed by 28 subunits, structurally arranged in four stacked seven membered rings [25], and by two 19S regulatory particles (RPs), composed each by 19 subunits (a 9 subunit lid, and a 10 subunit base structure [26]). The UBQ activation\u2013conjugation\u2013ligation-trimming cycle is extensively described in the biology- oriented companion book [27].",

Specificity may be targeted through chaperone-mediated CHIP-misfolded protein interactions (through the TPR domains), aiming to regulate the target/substrate protein clearance (i.e., to increase it in NDDs) [36]. Specificity may also be obtained by targeting CHIP\u2013E2-conjugating enzyme interactions (through the U-box domain), aiming to regulate the clearance of misfolded proteins through the specific CHIP\u2013E2 couple that ubiquitinates a particular target/substrate protein [37].",

Members of the Bcl-2-associated athanogene co-chaperone family (BAG) may mediate the docking of a CHIP\u2013chaperone\u2013target protein complex at the proteasome, facilitating proteasomal degradation (BAG-1 [38]). They may suppress CHIP-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of a target protein by abrogation of the CHIP\u2013E2 interaction (BAG-2 [39]). They may promote autophagic clearance when complexed with Hsp70 and CHIP in aging and/or protein aggregate-rich tissues (BAG-3 [40]). Finally, they may inhibit CHIP-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of a target protein through unclarified molecular mechanisms (BAG-5) [41]. The Hsp70-binding protein 1 (HspBP1) co-chaperone causes a conformational change in CHIP\u2013chaperone complexes and prevents the ubiquitination of Hsc70-bound client proteins [42]. The S100A2 and S100P proteins inhibit CHIP-mediated ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation in a Ca2+-dependent manner [43]. Stimulation of BAG-1- and BAG-3-promoted effects, and inhibition/prevention of CHIP negative regulation by BAG-2 and BAG-5 co-chaperones would be desirable in NDDs. Unfortunately, limited structural information on CHIP-containing chaperone complexes is available [44] to drive rational drug design projects.",

Complexes between Hsp70 and CHIP, BAG-1 and other J-domain proteins are affected by PES. Its multiple and potent anticancer effects may be caused in part by the triple bond chemical reactivity, but probably are not entirely amenable to the Hsp70 chaperone network [46]. Naturally occurring gambogic acid (GA, 3.3) causes the UPS-dependent degradation of mutant p53 [47]. GA decreases the Hsp90\u2013mutant p53 interaction and in parallel increases the levels of the ternary, UPS-oriented Hsp70\u2013CHIP\u2013mutant p53 complex through molecular interactions that are not yet elucidated. UPS-mediated degradation of polyUBQ mutant p53 via selective CHIP ubiquitination may be a GA-driven effect shared by other misfolded proteins [47]. The tricyclic phenothiazine methylene blue (MB, 3.4), currently in clinical trials in AD patients as a tau aggregation inhibitor [48], negatively modulates polyQ protein degradation through Hsp70 binding and subsequent sub-\u03bcM inhibition of CHIP-mediated polyQ protein ubiquitination [49]. Its multi-targeted activity profile is discussed in detail in Chapter 6. Imidazole-based apoptozole (3.5, Figure 3.1) restores the defective cellular processing of \u0394F508-CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator), a mutant, misfolded protein involved in cystic fibrosis [50]. Its rescuing effect at sub-\u03bcM concentrations is likely due to the disruption of the tertiary Hsp70\u2013CHIP\u2013mutant protein complex, and to the prevention of CHIP-mediated ubiquitination and degradation of \u0394F508-CFTR [50].",

Diamino compound A (3.12, Figure 3.3\n) is identified through an HTS campaign targeted against inhibitors of the ubiquitination of p27Kip1\n[65]. Enhanced UPS degradation of p27Kip1 is associated with poor prognosis in a variety of tumors, and SCFSkp2 is the E3 ligase that degrades p27Kip1\n[66]. Compound A moderately increases p27Kip1 levels in cells through the exclusion of Skp2 from the SCFSkp2 E3 ligase complex, probably by inhibiting its binding with another complex member [65].",

            "text": "Inhibitors of SCFSkp2 ligase activity stem from structure-based virtual screening of a 315K compound data set against an Skp2\u2013Csk1\u2013p27 ternary complex [67]. An alkylidene thiazolidine (compound C1, 3.13) reduces Skp2-mediated ubiquitination of p27 in vitro at low \u03bcM concentration, and increases p27 levels by decreasing its SCFSkp2-mediated degradation in melanoma cells [67]. The diacid SCF-I2 (3.14) is identified as an inhibitor of SCFCdc4 in an HTS campaign on a 50K member collection [68]. SCF-I2 binds to the WP40 domain of the F-box protein cell division control protein 4 (Cdc4), as shown by the X-ray structure of the Cdc4\u2013Skp1\u2013SCF-12 complex. The conformational change induced in Cdc4 by SCF-I2 allosterically inhibits substrate recognition and ubiquitination by SCFCdc4. Although WP40 domains are shared by F-box proteins in several SCF RING E3 ligases, SCF-I2 appears to be selective against SCFCdc4. SCF-I2 is not active in cellular assays, as its two carboxylates prevent cellular permeability [68]. LS-101 and LS-102 (respectively benzodiazepindione-based 3.15 and triazine-based 3.16) are identified from an \u22484M compound collection in an HTS campaign [69] targeted against the auto-ubiquitination of synoviolin, a RING E3 ligase highly expressed in synoviocytes of patients suffering of rheumatoid arthritis [70]. Both compounds show moderate \u03bcM potency against synoviolin auto-ubiquitination. LS-102 shows complete specificity vs. three other RING E3 ligases, while LS-101 is non-selective. Both compounds show in vivo activity in collagene-induced arthritis models [69]. Tetracyclic SMER3 (3.17) is identified in a phenotype-based HTS looking for small molecule enhancers of the therapeutic effects of rapamycin (see also autophagy, Chapter 4 here and in the biology-oriented companion book [27]) [71]. SMER3 inhibits the RING E3 ligase SCFMet30. It binds to the F-box motif in the Met30 protein, and it prevents its interaction with the SKC core protein Skp1. It is selective, as it is completely inactive against SCFCdc4\n[71]. Finally, the bis-imide thalidomide (3.18, Figure 3.3) binds to cereblon (CRBN), a component of a RING E3 ligase complex, and inhibits its interaction with damaged DNA binding protein 1 (DDBP1) and Cullin 4 (Cul4) [72]. It inhibits auto-ubiquitination in cells and in vivo, both in zebrafish and chicken models. Teratogenicity of thalidomide is at least partially due to CRBN binding and E3 ligase inhibition [72].",

The X-ray structures of murine CHIP complexed with the E2 enzymes Ubc13 [73], and of zebrafish CHIP and E2D1/UbcH5 [74] are available. The conformational dynamics of the human CHIP\u2013Ubc13 and CHIP\u2013UbcH5 complexes, studied by amide hydrogen exchange mass spectrometry (HX-MS), highlight their differences and suggest that CHIP\u2013E2 complexes in protein ubiquitination and chaperone interaction can be selectively modulated [75]. A systematic study [76] identifies a subset of E2 enzymes that bind CHIP through a common Ser-Pro-Ala motif, and promote target protein ubiquitination via activation of E2\u2013UBQ conjugates. Ubiquitination of target proteins depends on the E2 conjugating enzyme in terms of point of attachment (K48, K63, others) and UBQ chain length [76]. For example, CHIP\u2013UbcH5 preferentially catalyzes the mono-ubiquitination of target proteins through any Lys residue, while CHIP\u2013Ubc13 seems to be a polyUBQ-introducing complex with K63 specificity [77]. Finally, the tertiary E3:E2\u223cUBQ complexes containing either breast cancer type 1 (BRCA1)/BRCA1\u2013associated RING domain protein (BARD) or E4B/UFD2a as E3 ligases, and UbcH5c as E2 conjugating enzymes are studied by NMR [78]. The study provides valuable information on the role of RING/U-box E3 ligases such as CHIP in facilitating UBQ transfer and in promoting allosteric activation of E2\u223cUBQ complexes [78]. The wealth of structural information is not yet translated into small molecules as regulators/modulators of CHIP:E2 binary, or CHIP:E2\u223cUBQ tertiary complexes, and of their functions.",

P5091 restores sensitivity to bortezomib-resistant cancer cells, and shows synergistic effects when combined with proteasome and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors [108]. A structurally related analog (3.33) is more potent in cellular assays, causing an increase in p53 levels and an induction of p21 [109]. The aminotetrahydroacridine HBX-19,818 (3.34) is a cell permeable, selective, moderately potent USP7 inhibitor identified through an HTS campaign [93]. HDM2-p53 regulation and subsequent cytotoxicity are observed in human colon carcinoma (HCT116) cancer cells [93].",

The electrophilic dienone NSC687852/b-AP15 (3.36) is a pro-apoptotic compound identified in an HTS campaign on an NCI chemical collection [111]. It induces caspase-dependent apoptosis, and increases the levels of polyUBQ proteins through DUB inhibition [112]. b-AP15 selectively inhibits with moderate potency two structurally unrelated, proteasomal DUBs, USP14 and UCH37, probably because of their common association with the proteasome [113]. It shows in vivo potency in animal models of leukemia, colon, lung, and breast carcinoma [113], [114]. Pyrrole-based IU1 (3.37, Figure 3.5) is a selective, low \u03bcM inhibitor of USP14. It enhances in vitro UBQ\u2013transactive response/TAR DNA binding protein 43 (TDP-43), UBQ\u2013 ataxin-3, and UBQ\u2013tau levels, and increases their UPS-mediated proteolysis in murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) [115]. It shows antiviral properties against Dengue virus, most likely through UPS enhancement [116]. The tau- and ataxin-3-regulating role of USP14 (and consequently the putative therapeutic effect of IU1) is questionable [117], but a compensatory increase of USP14 activity is observed in elderly cells [118].",

For example, USP14\u2013UCH37-targeted bAP15 regulates caspase-1 activation and interleukin (IL)-1 release in an inflammation model, while IU1, a \u201cclean\u201d USP14 inhibitor, is inactive in the same model [119]. The existence of an additional, unknown DUB target for bAP15 cannot be ruled out, but the importance of cell-permeable DUB inhibitors with finely tuned poly-DUB pharmacology is evident. The available information regarding the structure of DUBs [79], and in particular the crystal structure of the 45 kDa catalytic domain of USP14 in isolation and complexed with UBQ aldehyde [120], should assist the rational design and synthesis of USP14 inhibitors with varying selectivity profiles.",
