The epidemiological link was from fruit bats infecting pigs that then served as an amplifier host and infected humans through close contact. Person-to-person transmission was rarely documented, and no further human cases have been reported from either country. Detailed analyses of the environmental changes that triggered this outbreak connecting wildlife (bats), livestock (pigs), and humans were reported (Pulliam et al., 2012, Daszak et al., 2013). This triad of human, animal, and environmental health (One Health) makes Nipah virus outbreaks a prime example of what we have termed the associated pan-epidemic Anthropocene (Lucey et al., 2017).",

In addition, a nosocomial outbreak involving over 60 people in a hospital in Siliguri, West Bengal, India in 2001 was recognized retrospectively (Chadha et al., 2006). In 2007, a smaller outbreak occurred in West Bengal, again with person-to-person transmission (Arankalle et al., 2011). Antibody to Nipah virus was found in 2003 in Pteropus giganteus fruit bats in Haryana State in northern India (Epstein et al., 2008). Subsequent outbreaks in Bangladesh have been documented during winter months over the past 16 years, associated with the consumption by humans of date palm sap (or occasionally a liquor from date palm sap) contaminated with Nipah virus from the urine or saliva of fruit bats (Hegde et al., 2016, Cortes et al., 2018).

For example, in a 2004 outbreak, \u2018patient F\u2019 transmitted to 22 persons (Gurley et al., 2007). Most such human-to-human transmission has been linked to close contact, and primarily from a small percentage of infected persons. For example, 62 of 122 persons (51%) with Nipah infection in Bangladesh in 2001\u20132007 became ill after close contact with another person with Nipah. A possible role for respiratory secretions in transmission has been suggested, because patients with Nipah in Bangladesh have often had pneumonia as well as encephalitis (Hossain et al., 2008), and viral RNA has frequently been identified in respiratory/oral swabs (Hassan et al., 2018). Of note, only nine of these 62 persons (7%) from the years 2001\u20132007 appeared to be responsible for transmitting the virus from person to person (Luby et al., 2009a, Luby et al., 2009b). The overall case-fatality rate has been estimated by the World Health Organization (WHO) to be approximately 75% (WHO/SEARO, 2001\u20132012).",

Importantly, however, Epstein and colleagues recently reported that Nipah virus RNA in bats exists throughout much of Bangladesh, even beyond the Nipah belt.

The initial October 2015 publication of the US \u201cBipartisan Report of the Blue Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefense\u201d included a brief scenario of a hypothetical attack in Washington, DC, and in other locations in the USA and abroad that was due to a \u2018genetically modified\u2019 and aerosolized Nipah virus. The zoonotic or \u2018One Health\u2019 nature of human infections with Nipah virus was recognized in this scenario, with animal deaths occurring as well as human fatalities. Notably, of the 34 recommendations from this Blue Ribbon panel, recommendation number 7 was to \u201cintegrate animal health and One Health approaches into biodefense strategies\u201d (Lieberman and Ridge, 2015). Similarly, on May 15, 2018 an all-day large simulation exercise called \u2018Clade X\u2019 was carried out and posted online (Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security). The hypothetical pathogen was a bioengineered transmissible hybrid virus with genes from Nipah virus and human parainfluenza virus. Intentional attacks began in Caracas, Venezuela and in Frankfurt, Germany and then spread to over 300 cities via international travel.",
