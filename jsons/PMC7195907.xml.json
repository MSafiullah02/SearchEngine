Prior to the successful prevention and treatment of cytomegalovirus (CMV) pneumonitis this complication was dreaded by HCT physicians as the outcome was universally poor. However, with the development of CMV testing prior to and after HCT, the use of ganciclovir, valganciclovir, foscarnet and letermovir [2] have proved to be effective at preventing CMV disease [3] and these are the three most commonly used drugs in the treatment of CMV disease.

With apologies to those who understand biochemistry, oxygenation is the addition of O2 to a solution and oxidation is the chemical combination of O2 with another atom (or the removal of electrons from an atom). O2 is important from the beginning of vine growing to the making of wine. By using the energy of sunlight, vines can convert carbon dioxide and water into carbohydrates and oxygen in a process called photosynthesis. Photosynthesis takes place in the leaves of the vine.",

Yeast cells (on the grape skin) need to be healthy during fermentation but the high levels of sugar when the grapes are first crushed may be toxic. Yeasts can produce Hydrogen Sulfide (H2S) which masks the fruit flavours in the wine and makes it appear harsh.",

O2 can also help to stabilise the colour in red wine and to make tannins more rounded. It is up to the winemaker to decide which technique of adding O2 to use to integrate into the vineyard\u2019s fermentation process. The level of free H2S in a wine or must does not keep a wine from taking up O2 but helps to deal with the potentially negative secondary effects (eg. browning and microbial contamination). O2 can also be quite useful in both ros\u00e9 and white winemaking. The amount of O2 added however is much less than in making red wine.",

This technique is favoured by large producers, sometimes combined with oak chips [7] but not used much by small producers because of the high cost of the equipment (personal communication from Leon Femfert, Fattoria Nittardi, Tuscany, Italy).",
