PBGM for use in humans unpredictably underestimate blood glucose in ferrets10 and have specificity for diagnosis of hypoglycemia in ferrets of 50%,9 which means that half of the ferrets in which the PBGM detect hypoglycemia are actually normoglycemic (false positives).9 PBGM developed for canine and feline patients (Alphatrak, Abbott, Abbott Park, IL) provide results that are more in agreement with laboratory analyzers.10 However, given the clinical importance of the diagnosis, these methods should be mainly used for screening and monitoring instead of for diagnosing. Instead, the diagnosis on presentation should be based on a hexokinase-based laboratory analyzer whenever possible. An empirical approach to the ferret presented with suspected hypoglycemic seizures is as follows:\u2022Placement of an intravenous (IV) catheter preferably in the cephalic vein (Fig. 2\n) under manual restraint. Alternatively, catheterize the saphenous or jugular vein (Fig. 3\n). Intraosseous catheterization should be avoided, because with proper technique, IV catheterization is almost always feasible.\u2022Collect an adequate amount of blood from the catheter itself in a lithium-heparin\u2013coated tube. Alternatively, obtain a blood sample to be placed in the collection tube under manual restraint (Figs. 4 and 5\n).\u2022Immediate measurement of glucose with a point-of-care device that uses the hexokinase method (eg, VetScan VS2, Abaxis, Darmstadt, Germany).\u2022Ideally, concurrently measure other electrolytes, including ionized calcium.\u2022If hypoglycemia is confirmed, slow administration of a bolus of 33% glucose solution or 50% dextrose solution (2\u20133 mL) followed by constant-rate infusion (CRI) of 5% glucose (10 mL/kg/h). Notice that there is potential risk of phlebitis by using high osmotic solutions.\u2022If the seizures persist, a second bolus of glucose/dextrose solution and administration of diazepam (rectally or IV, 0.5 mg/kg; CRI, 0.5\u20131.5 mg/kg/h) or midazolam (rectally or IV, 0.5 mg/kg; CRI, 0.3 mg/kg/h) may be administered.\u2022If available, a CRI of glucagon may be administered at a rate of 15 ng/kg/min (6.8 ng/lb/min).11\n\u2022Serial monitoring (ie, every 4\u20138 hours) of glucose concentration with a hexokinase method.\n",

Currently, there are point-of-care devices that evaluate ionized calcium along with the other electrolytes requiring only 0.2 mLs of whole blood (eg, CG8+ Cartridge, i-STAT, Abaxis, Darmstadt, Germany); however, their validity in ferrets has not been assessed. Differential diagnoses for hypocalcemia should include hypoparathyroidism, pseudohypoparathyroidism, hypomagnesemia, renal failure, acute pancreatitis, hypoalbuminemia, puerperal tetany, ethylene glycol intoxication, intestinal malabsorption, nutritional secondary hyperparathyroidism, and tumor lysis syndrome.12, 13 Among these causes, primary hypoparathyroidism has been recently diagnosed in 2 ferrets and pseudohypoparathyroidism in another ferret.12, 13, 14 Diagnosis of these conditions is based on a combination of low-serum ionized calcium concentration, high-serum phosphorus concentration, and appropriate renal function (based on serum chemistry values of serum urea nitrogen and creatinine) in the face of low parathyroid hormone (PTH) concentrations (hypoparathyroidism)12 or high PTH concentrations (pseudohypoparathyroidism).14\n",
