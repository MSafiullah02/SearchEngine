Methods CT images and medical records of 88 patients with confirmed mild COVID-19 pneumonia, a baseline CT, and at least one follow-up CT were retrospectively reviewed. CT features including lobar distribution and presence of ground glass opacities (GGO), consolidation, and linear opacities were analyzed on per-patient basis during each of five time intervals spanning the 3 weeks after disease onset. Total severity scores were calculated. Results Of patients, 85.2% had travel history to Wuhan or known contact with infected individuals. The most common symptoms were fever (84.1%) and cough (56.8%). The baseline CT was obtained on average 5 days from symptom onset. Four patients (4.5%) had negative initial CT. Significant differences were found among the time intervals in the proportion of pulmonary lesions that are (1) pure GGO, (2) mixed attenuation, (3) mixed attenuation with linear opacities, (4) consolidation with linear opacities, and (5) pure consolidation. The majority of patients had involvement of \u2265 3 lobes. Bilateral involvement was more prevalent than unilateral involvement. The proportions of patients observed to have pure GGO or GGO and consolidation decreased over time while the proportion of patients with GGO and linear opacities increased. Total severity score showed an increasing trend in the first 2 weeks.

In our study cohort, the interval between symptom onset and first chest CT ranged from 1 to 15 days. Hence, familiarity with evolution of CT findings is useful to radiologists. Ground glass opacities are the most common CT findings within 0-3 days of symptom onsets as described in other published reports focused on initial presentations [11] . Over time, GGO remains a common finding and consolidation occurs with higher frequencies than in the early phase of disease, which means the disease is progressing rapidly. It is different from what happened with SARS [12] . Frequency of consolidation decreases 2 weeks after symptom onset. Reticulations and linear opacities, signs of interstitial involvement, and fibrosis become increasing prevalent later in the disease course.
