Furthermore, respiratory failure requiring artifical ventialtion is a well recognised reason for intensive care support but it can be difficult to determine if this is due to an underlying non-infectious condition such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), infection or a combination of both. The early diagnosis and management of respiratory infection combined with appropriate ventilatory support aids prognosis and the efficient use of intensive care facilities given the number of patients affected.",

Identification of the critically ill pneumonia patient is essential to the early and effective management of this condition. Severity-of-illness scores, such as the CURB-65 (confusion, uremia, respiratory rate, low blood pressure, age 65 years or greater), or prognostic models, such as the Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI), can be used to identify patients with CAP who might benefit from ICU admission.

This gave rise to the original acronym CURB- 65. In the derivation and validation cohorts, the 30-day mortality among patients with 0, 1, or 2 factors was 0.7, 2.1, and 9.2 %, respectively.

Patients with underlying COPD are most likely to benefit from NIV [8]. Patients with CAP who were randomized to receive NIV had more than a 25 % absolute risk reduction for intubation [9]. Inability to cough may limit the use of NIV, but intermittent application of NIV may allow for its use in patients with productive cough without excessive sputum production. Prompt recognition of a failed NIV trial is important, as patients who require intubation after a prolonged NIV trial have a worse outcome. Within the first 1\u20132 h of NIV, failure to improve respiratory rate and oxygenation or failure to decrease carbon dioxide partial pressure (pCO2) in patients with initial hypercarbia predicts NIV failure and warrants prompt intubation. NIV provides no benefit for patients with adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), which may be indistinguishable from CAP among patients with bilateral alveolar infiltrates. Patients with CAP who have severe hypoxemia (PaO2/FiO2 ratio, <150) are also poor candidates for NIV [10].",

Culture results may be available by this stage and may necessitate a change in therapy.

Then every patient requiring critical care support with respiratory failure should have a throat swab in viral transport medium or nasopharyngeal aspirate, and a good quality lower respiratory sample, e.g. broncholaveloar lavage (BAL) or equivalent, sent for viral studies, i.e. immunofluorescence or the polymerase chain reaction (PCR).",
