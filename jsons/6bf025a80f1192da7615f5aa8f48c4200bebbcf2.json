After being ignored for a long time due to the high computational complexity it requires, pseudoknot is one type of RNA structures that has been given a lot of attention lately. Pseudoknot structures have functional importance since they appear, for example, in viral genome RNAs and ribozyme active sites. In this paper, we present a folding framework, TAG RNA Inf, for RNA structures that support pseudoknots. Our approach is based on learning TAG RNA grammars from training data with structural information. The inferred grammars are used to indentify sequences with structures analogous to those in the training set and generate a folding for these sequences. We present experimental results and comparisons with other known pseudoknot folding approaches.",

Another factor that has led acceleration of RNA structural research is the rise of the RNA World Hypothesis [10] which suggests that the current DNA and protein world have evolved from an RNA based world. Analysis of the structures of RNA sequences is essential in understanding their functional properties. Consequently, it is imperative for creating new drugs and understanding genetic diseases [6] [24] . Computational methods can provide less expensive solutions to structure analysis than other methods such as nuclear magnetic resonance and x-ray crystallography.",

Thermodynamic approaches use dynamic programming to compute the secondary structure with the minimum free energy (mfe) [13] [35] . These approaches use experimentally determined parameters for free energies. Comparative approaches are based on aligning a set of homologous sequences and computing the structure based on the alignment [8] [12] . Recently, a new approach for RNA structure analysis based on grammatical formalisms has emerged. This approach was inspired by David Searls work in the early 90's where he studied the linguistics of biological sequences [28] . He suggested the use of formal grammars as a tool to model and analyze DNA, RNA, and proteins. The use of grammars has attracted the attention of many researchers [26] [31] because it can model long range interactions. In addition, grammatical models are concise and easy to understand representation of structures of sequence families.",

Two bps (i, j) and (k, l) are nested if i < k and l < j. Two bps are crossing if i < k and j < l. Pseudoknot is one type of RNA structures that exhibits crossing bps. It has been proven that predicting RNA structures with pseudoknots using free energy minimization is an NP-complete problem [17] . Also, pseudoknots cannot be modeled with Context Free Grammars (CFG) due to the crossing dependencies of their bps. Consequently, until recently, pseudoknots were ignored in RNA secondary structure analysis.

Otherwise, the biologist will always be dependent on a grammar expert. In [1] , we presented a grammatical inference engine for TAG RNA . We also presented a structure identification framework, where the inferred grammars can be used to answer the question of whether an RNA input sequence exhibits a certain structure or not. In this paper, we present a modification of the framework which is capable of folding 1 an RNA sequence with identification as a first step in folding. We test our solution on RNA sequences from Pseudobase [4] , Rfam [11] , and the tmRNA database [34] , and we compare our results with a representative subset of the available tools that are capable of folding RNA sequences including pseudoknots. We compare our results with ILM and, pknotsRG. PknotsRG is an algorithm for folding RNA sequences under the mfe model. It requires O(n 4 ) time and O(n 2 ) space. The ILM algorithm is based on the loop matching algorithm [18] , and it also utilizes thermodynamic parameters. The worst case time complexity of ILM is O(n 4 ) and the space complexity is O(n 2 ). We also compare our results with TAG RNA which our solution is based on. The folding approach provided in [31] using TAG RNA is based on single generic grammar. Our approach is different because we infer specific grammars and use them to do identification and folding. TAG RNA has time and space complexity of O(n 5 ) and O(n 4 ) respectively.",

Additionally, if the input sequence is identified to have the structure represented by the selected set of grammars, the sequence will be folded, and TAG RNA Inf will output its structure. If the sequence was accepted by more than one grammar in the set, the structure resulting in minimum free energy is selected. To calculate the mfe for a certain structure, we use RNAeval tool from the Vienna suite [13] . RNAeval does not support pseudoknots. We approximate the free energy of a pseudoknot by the sum of the free energies for its two stem-loops as calculated by RNAeval. If a sequence was accepted by the parser, resulting in a non-zero score, but was rejected by the threshold function, the user may choose to fold the sequence despite its rejection. However, the confidence level for this structure is not expected to be high. The framework is illustrated in Fig. 3 .",

We also generated structures for the same set of 31 sequences by ILM, pknotsRG, and TAG RNA . pknotsRG was tested in enforce mode (enf), which enforces a pseudoknot in the predicted structure. Also, Use extended helix plot score option was set for ILM as recommended by the ILM website for single sequence structure prediction. All other options for all tools were set to their defaults. The grammars generated by TAG RNA Inf have default minimum stem length of 2 and maximum bulge loop length of 2. Table1 lists the comparative results for this experiment. TAG RNA Inf results in the best specificity with a big margin and the second best sensitivity after TAG RNA with a very small difference. The high specificity of TAG RNA Inf is expected because the grammars used for prediction are H-type pseudoknot grammars. Sequences whose structures are not expected to follow any of the inferred grammars are excluded in the identification phase, as will be illustrated further in the following two experiments. Figure 4 illustrate an example where TAG RNA Inf gives more accurate structure prediction than ILM and pknotsRG. Fig. 4 .

Structure images are generated using Pseudoviewer [7] When we compared the structures predicted by TAG RNA and TAG RNA Inf, we found out that in most cases where TAG RNA Inf gave better predictions than TAG RNA , the structures predicted by TAG RNA had one bp stems in them. As mentioned earlier the default setting for the minimum stem size in TAG RNA Inf grammars is two. TAG RNA has an option to change the minimum stem size, but we tested all tools under their default settings. It is worthy to mention here, that the reported results for TAG RNA take advantage of the identification phase performed by TAG RNA Inf, and these results will endure a drop when we eliminate this phase in the second experiment.",

The two added grammars were for hair-pin RNA structures. The aim of this experiment was to test the effect of broadening the search space beyond the structures of the training set and compare it with the other approaches. We realize that the search space of the other tools is much broader. It is worth noting here that our approach is structure prediction through grammar learning. In this experiment, the two grammars were added, without going through the learning phase. Also, a threshold function was not inferred, and no identification was done before the structure prediction. Table 4 includes the results for predicting the structure of the 36 input sequences with and without the added non-pseudoknot grammars. It also includes the results for pknotsRG in enforce pseudoknot mode and mfe mode. The mfe mode predicts the minimum free energy structure without trying to enforce a pseudoknot structure. We report sensitivity, specificity, and number of sequences whose predicted structure differed due to introducing the non-pseudoknot grammars for TAG RNA Inf, or switching to mfe mode in the case of pknotsRG.

The actual structure for TRV-PSG [32] , illustrated in Fig. 5 , consists of a hair-pin concatenated to a H-type pseudoknot. PknotsRG gave perfect structure prediction of TRV_PSG in both enf and emf modes. ILM gave almost perfect structure prediction where it predicted one additional bp in the hair-pin stem (s1). TAG RNA Inf with the H-type pseudoknot grammar set totally missed the hair-pin structure (s1). On the other hand, with the added two hair-pin grammars, TAG RNA Inf predicted a hair-pin structure for TRV-PSG, and the pseudoknot (s2 and s3) was missed. Notice once more that the identification phase was able to recognize that the structure of TRV-PSG does not belong to the structures represented by the inferred set of grammars. TAG RNA Inf could have been able to predict the correct structure for TRV-PSG if the training data set included a sequence that had a similar structure, a hair-pin concatenated to the pseudoknot.",

These algorithms use a (n+1) 4 matrix and they can be described as metric-centric. Independent of the elementary trees in the given grammar, the algorithms step through each entry in this matrix to check if any trees can be placed in this entry. This means that even if no tree will ever be placed in a matrix entry, some work is done corresponding to this entry. In [21] , we describe new parsing algorithms for SLTAG and ESLTAG which are treecentric. These algorithms are expected to be more time efficient in practice. Additionally, since the matrix used by the parsers is usually sparse, we intend to use other data structures that will result in reducing the space requirements as well. We plan to provide comparative results to prove the vantage of the new algorithms in practice. Additionally, we will work on designing a parallelized version of these algorithms.",
