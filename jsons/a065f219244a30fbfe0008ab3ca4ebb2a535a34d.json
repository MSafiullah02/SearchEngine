Virus-like particles (VLPs) are a form of subunit vaccine consisting of self-assembling shells derived from virus capsid proteins. Due to the absence of viral genomic material, VLPs are rendered non-replicative and non-infectious, enhancing their safety profi le. In comparison to other subunit vaccines, the resemblance of VLPs to their corresponding native virus provides enhanced immunogenicity and specifi city. VLP capsid proteins retain their natural structural conformation, harbouring undamaged antigenic motifs in a more immunologically relevant state than an inactivated virus vaccine. VLPs can also resemble a live attenuated virus without replicative or infectious capacity due to structural similarity and utilisation of similar processing pathways. In general, VLPs are considered significantly safer than many other virally derived vaccines by avoiding potential hazards such as attenuated virus reversion or incomplete inactivation.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "The fi rst VLP identifi ed and studied was isolated from patients infected with Hepatitis B virus (HBV) in 1968 (Bayer et al. 1968 ). Due to the ability of some viral capsid proteins to spontaneously form stable particles, many viruses produce VLPs as a natural by-product of their infection cycle. Engerix (GlaxoSmithKline) was the fi rst human VLP-based vaccine, licensed in 1989 for vaccination against HBV. Since then a number of VLP vaccines have been approved for clinical use, including Epaxal (Crucell) for Hepatitis A virus (HAV), Recombivax (Merck), Hepavax (Crucell), and many others for HBV, Gardasil (Merck), and Cervarix (GlaxoSmithKline) for human papillomavirus (HPV), and Infl exal V (Crucell) for Infl uenza. Bolstered by the success of these vaccines many new VLPs are being developed, with a selection of examples summarised in Table 9 .1 . In addition, VLPs have also been produced from various non-human mammalian viruses, primarily for vaccination of livestock.

While single-protein VLPs have a relatively simple structure, multi-protein VLPs can contain unique structural features such as several distinct capsid layers. For example, expression of various combinations of the VP2, VP4, VP6, and VP7 capsid proteins of rotavirus can produce stable VLPs with double or even triple capsid layers (Crawford et al. 1994 ; Sabara et al. 1991 ) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 358, "end": 378, "text": "(Jiang et al. 1992 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 398, "end": 422, "text": "(Kirnbauer et al. 1992 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF39"}, {"start": 442, "end": 472, "text": "(Lopez de Turiso et al. 1992 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF49"}, {"start": 560, "end": 580, "text": "(Kibenge et al. 1999", "ref_id": "BIBREF37"}, {"start": 595, "end": 619, "text": "(Brautigam et al. 1993 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 696, "end": 721, "text": "(Betenbaugh et al. 1995 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 742, "end": 764, "text": "(Baumert et al. 1998 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 780, "end": 806, "text": "(Latham and Galarza 2001 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 826, "end": 852, "text": "(Yamshchikov et al. 1995 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF94"}, {"start": 1217, "end": 1240, "text": "(Crawford et al. 1994 ;", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1241, "end": 1261, "text": "Sabara et al. 1991 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF75"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 873, "end": 879, "text": "Fig. 9", "ref_id": null}], "section": "VLP Structural Conformation"}, {"text": "Multi-protein VLPs can also be produced from variant copies of the same protein derived from different viral strains. These mosaic VLPs effi ciently confer protection against several strains of the same virus (Buonamassa et al. 2002 ). An alternative means of increasing VLP versatility is through the incorporation of antigens from heterologous sources. Chimeric VLPs contain antigenic material from a target source supported by a stable VLP framework. These antigens can be inserted as peptides into the VLP capsid protein or substructural secondary VLP proteins, or covalently coupled to the surface of VLP. Chimeric VLPs have an extensive range of potential applications, and will be discussed later in this chapter. Enveloped VLPs consist of either a single-protein or multi-protein VLPs encapsulated in a lipid bilayer captured from the cell membrane. Co-expression of haemagglutinin (HA), neuraminidase (NA), matrix protein M1, and ion channel protein M2 from infl uenza virus produces enveloped VLPs with the same size and morphology as native infl uenza virions, including the characteristic surface spikes HA and NA (Latham and Galarza 2001 ) . The lipid bilayer of enveloped VLPs can also support the incorporation of transmembrane anchored proteins from multiple viral strains (enveloped mosaic VLPs) or even heterologous pathogens (enveloped chimeric VLPs) (Buonaguro et al. 2001 ; Halsey et al. 2008 ; Visciano et al. 2011 ) .

The same characteristics that benefi t effi cient virus reproduction, such as spontaneously polymerising capsid proteins, also promote the Fig. 9 .1 VLP Structure. VLPs can be categorised based on characteristic structural features such as capsid protein composition, encapsulation inside a lipid bilayer envelope, and incorporation of antigens by recombinant insertion or chemical conjugation. Additional combinations other than those illustrated also exist, such as multi-protein chimeric VLPs and enveloped mosaic or chimeric VLPs formation of VLPs; however, the isolation of VLPs produced from virally infected cells is not an effi cient means of purifi cation. An expansive range of protein expression systems have been developed for a variety of applications, and can be effectively commandeered for the production and purifi cation of high quality VLPs. Recombinant expression of viral capsid proteins through tailored expression systems can also enable the production of VLPs from viruses not routinely cultured in laboratories. Common VLP expression systems include bacteria, yeast, insect cell lines, mammalian cell lines, plants, and cell-free cultures. Each expression system has its benefi ts and pitfalls as outlined in Table 9 .2 (Rebeaud and Bachmann 2012 ) . While most VLPs can be produced in multiple expression systems, the quaternary structural conformation of the capsid proteins produced can vary due to differences in post-translational modifi cations such as phosphorylation and glycosylation. This can have signifi cant effects on the immunogenicity of VLPs, as these modifi cations are often essential for eliciting the desired immune response. Escherichia coli ( E. coli ) has long been a primary laboratory workhorse bacterium, facilitating the expression and purifi cation of recombinant proteins through plasmid transformation or bacteriophage vector delivery. Expression in E. coli is often preferred when producing small proteins with limited post-translational modifi cations; however, larger proteins with post-translational modifi cations require a more complex expression system (e.g. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) mammalian cell line). The presence of endotoxins during downstream purifi cation also presents a signifi cant challenge for vaccine development from a bacterial expression system. Each VLP is unique, with optimal expression identifi ed through trial and error by comparing the translated products of multiple expression systems. For example, Rabbit Haemorrhagic Disease Virus (RHDV) VLPs can be optimally produced by expressing the RHDV VP60 capsid protein in Spodoptera frugiperda (SF) cells using a recombinant baculovirus vector (Young et al. 2004 (Young et al. , 2006 Peacey et al. 2007 ). Icosahedral T = 3 VLPs with a diameter of around 40 nm spontaneously form when VP60 is expressed in SF21 cells. Each VLP contains 180 copies of the VP60 capsid protein, representing a relatively simple single-protein non-enveloped VLP.

Expression of recombinant proteins in plants is achieved through transgene insertion into the nuclear or plastid genome, or using plant viral vectors. While plant cells do not have a mammalianlike post-translational modifi cation system, plant-specifi c glycosylation can have an immunostimulatory effect. Some examples of VLPs produced in a transgenic plant system include Norwalk virus (Tacket 2007 ; Tacket et al. 2000 ) , HIV-1 (Scotti et al. 2009 ), and infl uenza virus VLPs (Medicago) . Another recently developed expression platform is the cell-free system. This usually consists of extracts from E. coli or yeast cells, and was developed primarily to enable the production of viral capsid proteins which have toxic intermediate protein forms. Development of VLPs containing unnatural amino acids (UAAs) has also been achieved using the cell-free system. The non-replenishing nature of a cell-free system renders this method highly demanding with some scalability limitations. The infl uenza vaccine Rebeaud and Bachmann ( 2012 ) Infl exal V (Herzog et al. 2009 ), and the hepatitis A vaccine Epaxal (Bovier 2008 ) (Crucell) are two commercialised VLP vaccines that consist of virosomes produced in a cell-free expression system. Following production, VLPs must be isolated from the expression system and purifi ed to suffi cient quality for downstream applications. VLPs are usually isolated through a combination of cell lysis, removal of cellular debris, VLP concentration, and selective purifi cation. Some mammalian and insect cell lines secrete VLPs into the supernatant, negating the necessity for cell lysis (Vicente et al. 2011 ). Resilient cells (e.g. bacteria, plant cells) may require more robust mechanical manipulation such as ultrasonication, compression, abrasion, repeated freeze/thawing, or enzymatic (Katpally et al. 2010 ) degradation for VLP release (Cull and McHenry 1990 ; Salazar and Asenjo 2007 ) . VLPs can be purifi ed by differential centrifugation; however, this can pose limitations on scalability. GMP production of vaccine-grade purifi ed VLPs for commercial applications often involves industrial-scale protein purifi cation methods such as sizeexclusion, ion exchange, or affi nity chromatography columns (Vicente et al. 2011 ) . Optimal solvent conditions must also be identifi ed to maintain VLP stability. Solution pH is critical, as some VLPs irreversibly denature and disassemble beyond a specifi c pH range. For example, RHDV VLPs deteriorate in an alkaline environment, with complete VLP disruption above pH 9 ( Fig. 9 .3 ). VLP solubility is another important consideration as some VLPs may aggregate at higher concentrations, forming an insoluble precipitate.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 518, "end": 532, "text": "(Tacket 2007 ;", "ref_id": "BIBREF81"}, {"start": 533, "end": 553, "text": "Tacket et al. 2000 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF82"}, {"start": 562, "end": 581, "text": "(Scotti et al. 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF78"}, {"start": 611, "end": 621, "text": "(Medicago)", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1138, "end": 1167, "text": "Rebeaud and Bachmann ( 2012 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF71"}, {"start": 1180, "end": 1199, "text": "(Herzog et al. 2009", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 1238, "end": 1252, "text": "(Bovier 2008 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1754, "end": 1774, "text": "(Vicente et al. 2011", "ref_id": "BIBREF85"}, {"start": 1957, "end": 1980, "text": "(Katpally et al. 2010 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 2009, "end": 2033, "text": "(Cull and McHenry 1990 ;", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 2034, "end": 2059, "text": "Salazar and Asenjo 2007 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF76"}, {"start": 2377, "end": 2399, "text": "(Vicente et al. 2011 )", "ref_id": "BIBREF85"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 2691, "end": 2697, "text": "Fig. 9", "ref_id": null}], "section": "Production of VLPs"}, {"text": "VLPs are an incredibly versatile vaccination tool.

Each VLP can be considered a polymerised protein subunit vaccine, Fig. 9 .3 RHDV VLP stability at an alkaline pH. RHDV VLPs are visibly perturbed under transmission electron microscopy in an elevated solvent pH, resulting in irreversible particle disassembly supporting modifi cations such as recombinant peptide insertion and chemical conjugation of peptides, proteins, lysate, carbohydrates, and lipoproteins to form chimeric VLPs. Some VLPs can support insertion of short peptide sequences at specifi c sites in their structural capsid proteins without impairing VLP formation. For example, RHDV VP60 is known to retain its ability to spontaneously form VLPs despite recombinant insertion of peptides at the N-terminus, C-terminus, or at amino acid residue 306 (Crisci et al. 2009 ); however, these sites have restrictions on inserted peptide length and residue sequence. The N-terminus of RHDV VP60 can support an insertion of <33 amino acids (Peacey et al. 2007 ) , while other viral proteins such as polyomavirus VP1 can support insertions ranging from 9 to 120 amino acids (Eriksson et al. 2011 ; Lasickiene et al. 2012 ; Mazeike et al. 2012 ; Middelberg et al. 2011 ) .

External site insertion is required for effective B cell activation and depending on the selected VLP this method of chimeric VLP design can have signifi cantly increased complexity.

The primary limitations on intraparticulate encapsulation are the VLPs internal cavity volume and the availability of positively charged amino acids (Zeltins 2013 ) . VLPs with the ability to encapsulate exogenous DNA have been explored as a possible means of gene delivery. VLPs produced from the VP1 capsid protein of the human polyomavirus John Cunningham (JC) virus are a promising candidate, with the ability to harbour DNA plasmids up to 14 kbp in length (Fang et al. 2012 ). Delivery of pEGFP-C1 plasmid into human epithelial kidney 293 (HEK293) cells and subsequent EGFP production was achieved by loading the plasmid into JC virus VLPs through osmotic shock, which disrupts the VLP structure and increases permeability (Ou et al. 1999 ) . More recently in vivo plasmid loading during expression of VP1 in E. coli was found to result in superior plasmid loading over osmotic shock or VLP reassembly, validated with JC virus VLPs encapsulating pEGFP-N3 plasmid ).
