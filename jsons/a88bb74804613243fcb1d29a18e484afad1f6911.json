            "text": "Sixty-eight percent of female MRL-lpr mice developed a post-partum exacerbation of their mild spontaneous arthritis within 30 days of parturition. The flare became evident between 5 and 15 days after delivery. Histologically it was characterized by a significant increase of subsynovial inflammation and synovial hyperplasia without changes in the level of cartilage and bone erosion. Immunohistologically, marked subsynovial and frequent synovial staining of MHC class II bearing cells was noted, along with the sporadic presence of CD3, CD4, and CD43 receptor-bearing cells in the subsynovium. Injection of physiological levels (0-08 mg/kg) of estradiol on days 2, 3, 9, 15 and 20 post-partum delayed and reduced the flare to 23% of the animals. Administration of pharmacological amounts (0 4mg/kg per day for 2 weeks following Freund's complete adjuvant injection) prevented adjuvant-enhanced arthritis, reducing the incidence from 67% to the baseline 21% level. Deleterious changes in the underlying systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), as demonstrated by proteinurea and mortality rate increases, were elicited only by the employed pharmacological amounts of estradiol. These results indicate that the MRL-lpr mice might serve as a model for post-partum flare of arthritis in SLE and rheumatoid arthritis by providing an approach to study the complexity of the effects of pregnancy on autoimmune diseases, and to obtain further evidence for the involvement of oestrogen in arthritis.",

The tissues/organs commonly affected are the skin, kidney, brain, vasculature, heart, and diarthroid joints. Articular disease is the most frequent early manifestation of SLE, being present in more than 90% of cases. This articular pathology is often transient, and generally less severe than that seen in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). As articular changes often precede other features of SLE, they are frequently diagnosed as RA. Notwithstanding, RA also may coexist with SLE [1] .",

Therefore the effect of pregnancy on these diseases is of particular importance. It is known that oestrogen levels increase during pregnancy, and decline immediately after delivery. Oestrogen has two known effects on the immune system: it suppresses antigen-specific T cell-dependent immune functions, characteristic of RA, and stimulates B cell responses, characteristic of SLE [4] . While the exacerbating effect of pregnancy in SLE is controversial [5, 6] , the ameliorating effect in RA is well described [7] . However, more than 90% of patients with RA remission during pregnancy develop a post-partum flare up of the disorder [8] . These findings suggest that oestrogen might influence these rheumatic conditions.",

It develops a mild spontaneous form of arthritis which can be enhanced by an intradermal injection of Freund's complete adjuvant (FCA) [16] . Although the sex hormone involvement in SLE in MRLlpr is well characterized [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] , oestrogen has been studied less in respect to its effect on MRL-lpr arthritis [27] , and has not been described in relation to pregnancy in these mice. We noticed during routine breeding of MRL-lpr mice that a significant number of older female breeders developed postpartum erythema and swelling. Hence, this study examines the possibility of whether the MRL-lpr spontaneous arthritis could serve as a model for post-partum arthritis flare up in SLE or RA. We also investigated the effect of estradiol on the murine arthritis, using both the post-partum arthritis flare up and the adjuvant enhanced arthritis models in MRL-lpr mice.",

The clinical onset of post-partum flare was successfully prevented (21%, 3/14) and the time of the onset delayed by the administration of physiological amounts of estradiol. This frequency seen in estradiol-injected animals was comparable to the freqency of clinical signs of arthritis onset in non-mated, age-matched female MRL-lpr mice, which developed spontaneous arthritis (23%, 5/22). Bimaleolar ankle measurements, which quantify the severity of the swelling, showed similar patterns (Fig. lb) , although there was a remission of swelling in some of the cases in all three groups. Subsynovial inflammation, synovial hypertrophy, and the overall histological scores increased significantly post-partum (P < 0 05) (Fig. 2) . However, there was no significant increase in cartilage erosion, pannus formation, or bone destruction. Administration of physiological doses of estradiol significantly lowered the overall histological score (P = 0034), and prevented cartilage erosion, pannus formation, and bone destruction. It also decreased somewhat the level of inflammation and synovial hypertrophy. Figure 3 demonstrates the extent of subsynovial inflammation and synovial hypertrophy.

The effect of pharmacological amounts of estradiol (0 4 mg/ kg) was also investigated on the development of adjuvantenhanced arthritis in female MRL-lpr mice. Thirteen-weekold mice received this dose daily for 2 weeks starting on the day of the FCA injection. This dose prevented the adjuvant enhancement of disease, as indicated by the similar frequency of clinical arthritis observed in treated and control animals ( Table 2 ). The severity of swelling was significantly lower than in adjuvant-injected mice (P = 0012). Histological analysis revealed a significant degree of prevention in all the pathological parameters examined, including the overall score (P < 0-05).

The reason this finding was not previously noticed is most probably that the MRL-lpr mice are generally bred at a younger age to avoid the severity of the SLE, thereby dampening the intensity of the flare up of arthritis. This age-dependence, reflecting the time required to reach a certain stage of underlying disease, was also noted in this strain during the development of the adjuvant-enhanced arthritis model (manuscript submitted). It is of interest that in both cases approximately 2/3 of the animals developed exacerbated arthritis. This indicates the presence of an underlying component of the disease at this age that can be accelerated by certain factors. The flare-up occurred as early as 5 days after delivery, with a mean onset of 13 days, and resulted in a massive subsynovial inflammatory infiltrate. There was, however, no considerable cartilage or bone destruction by day 30 post-partum. We are planning to examine the longer-term effect of the flare-up on the severity of arthritis histopathology in post-partum versus non-mated female mice.",

            "text": "Oestrogen is a probable factor in the controversial effect of the pill. Although it has been previously reported that female sex hormones have only a minimal therapeutical effect on RA [45] , the latest controlled study showed that adjunct therapy with oestrogen, when applied to post-menopausal RA, can be effective if the resulting serum oestrogen levels are adequate [46] . It is noteworthy that most of the pills contain both oestrogen and progesterone [47] . Holmdahl et al. proposed that the remission of RA during pregnancy is primarily due to oestrogen, and that progesterone might potentiate this event. It is clear that progesterone alone had no effect in preventing type II collagen-induced arthritis in mice [48] . Mattsson et al. suggested that post-partum flare-up is due to both the fall in the elevated pregnancy steroid levels and the surge in prolactin release after delivery [49] . Holmdahl et al. described the role of oestrogen in RA prevention as model-and strain-dependent [50] . Schlaghecke et al. reported the preventive effect of oestrogen on adjuvant arthritis in rats [51] . The MRL-lpr arthritis models could serve as alternatives to the above models, since there is a need to study the described model and strain dependency of the oestrogen effect. Here we report the preventive effect physiological doses of estradiol have on the post-partum flare-up in spontaneous arthritis and the effect pharmacological doses have on adjuvant-enhanced arthritis in MRL-lpr mice.",
