Since its first 5 appearance in Wuhan, China, in December 2019, an increasing number of cases are being diagnosed 6 worldwide.

These factor have limited the role of these 18 invasive procedures in case of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic patients. BAL is unreasonable 19 as a screening tool, and it is indeed performed only if a false negative result from the nasopharyngeal 20 swab is suspected 4 . 21 The reasons behind the high rate of false negative results obtained from the nasopharyngeal swab is 22 unknown at this time. Possible causes include collection of inappropriate or inadequate material, 23 improper specimen transportation, low viral load in asymptomatic patients, and lab errors. In 24 particular, it was argued that the low detection rate of the nasopharyngeal swab could be directly 25 dependent on the wrong execution of the sampling. Since in the posterior wall of the nasopharynx we 2 26 found the highest concentration of lymphocytes possibly phagocyting infected cells it seems to be 27 extremely important to properly collect nasopharyngeal samples at the posterior nasopharyngeal 28 tonsil region in order to increase the virus detection rate. Since the sampling is not done under direct 29 vision, it was suggested that only ENT specialists have the adequate anatomical knowledge to 30 properly perform the nasopharyngeal swab. In fact, some other factors should be considered during 31 the test. Nasal septal deformities (involving up to 90% in the adult population 5 ), nasal obstruction 32 from nasal polyposis, or inferior turbinates hypertrophy can prevent from reaching the rhinopharynx.33 In these cases, the possibility to perform the swab under direct endoscopic vision could ensure the 34 correct execution of the test.",

In the common clinical practice, dedicated nurses 40 are usually involved in performing nasopharyngeal swabs due to easily organization, and reduced 41 costs. A simple study design can indeed compare nurses usually involved in sample collection, and 42 ENT specialists under endoscopic vision, in performing the nasopharyngeal swab in the same patients 43 cohort. A higher detection rate in the second group will demonstrate how the collection of 44 inappropriate or inadequate material represent a leading cause of the high false negative rate. 45 Although it seems clear that further evidences are needed to ameliorate nasopharyngeal swab 46 sensitivity, several issue are encountered during studies design. Health-care providers involved in 47 Covid-19 assistance are directly subjected to infective risks, particularly if invasive procedures are 48 performed. In particular, routine endoscopic examinations including nasal endoscopy are considered 49 aerosol generating procedures with high risk for transmission 7 . Other than the ethical issues related 50 to the risk of contagion, other logistical problems are inevitably encountered. A tailored room with",
