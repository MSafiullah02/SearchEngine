Classical compartmental models must be modified and studied to correctly describe the effects of forced external actions to reduce the impact of the disease. In addition, data are often incomplete and heterogeneous, so a high degree of uncertainty must naturally be incorporated into the models. In this work we address both these aspects, through an optimal control formulation of the epidemiological model in presence of uncertain data. After the introduction of the optimal control problem, we formulate an instantaneous approximation of the control that allows us to derive new feedback controlled compartmental models capable of describing the epidemic peak reduction. The need for long-term interventions shows that alternative actions based on the social structure of the system can be as effective as the more expensive global strategy. The importance of the timing and intensity of interventions is particularly relevant in the case of uncertain parameters on the actual number of infected people. Simulations related to data from the recent COVID-19 outbreak in Italy are presented and discussed.",

Therefore, a modelling approach based on a limited time horizon that takes into account the social structure of the population is necessary in order to optimize containment strategies. Most current research, however, has focused on control procedures aimed at optimizing the use of vaccinations and medical treatments [5, 7, 14, 15] and only recently the problem has been tackled from the perspective of non-pharmaceutical interventions [29, 32] . In addition, data collected by governments are often incomplete and heterogeneous, so a high degree of uncertainty needs to be incorporated into predictive models [9, 11, 16, 25, 31, 38] . This is the case of the spreading of COVID-19 worldwide, which have been often mistakenly underestimated due to a combination of factors, including deficiencies in surveillance and diagnostic capacity, and the large number of infectious but asymptomatic individuals [25, 31, 41] .",

In fact, to have reliable forecasts it is of paramount importance to consider the presence of uncertain quantities as a structural feature of the epidemic dynamics. From a mathematical point of view, we can rely on the methods of uncertainty quantification (UQ) to obtain efficient and accurate solutions based on stochastic orthogonal polynomials for the differential model with random inputs [40] . Few results are actually available regarding methods of UQ in epidemic systems, we mention in this direction [9, 11, 16, 38] . The main idea is to increase the dimensionality of the problem adding the possible sources of uncertainty from the very beginning of the modelling. Hence, we extrapolate statistics by looking at the so-called quantities of interest, i.e. statistical quantities that can be obtained from the solution and that give some global information with respect to the input parameter like expected solution of the problem or higher order moments. Several techniques can be adopted for the approximation of the quantities of interest, in this paper we adopt stochastic Galerkin methods that allow to reduce the problem to a set of deterministic equations for the numerical evaluation of the solution in presence of uncertainties. We refer the interested reader to recent surveys and monographs on the topic [17, 26, 34, 40] .",

Section 4 is dedicated to the presentation of some numerical examples including applications to the COVID-19 epidemic in Italy. The most up-to-date information available to date has been used for these simulations. This illustrates the potential application of the model as a real-time forecasting tool.

In the following we will adopt the simple compartmental model (2) to derive our feedback controlled formulation in presence of uncertainty. The extension to more realistic compartmental models in epidemiology such as SEIR and/or MSEIR can be carried out in a similar way. In order to simplify the description, we will consider the case d a = 1 and set the social dependence as the age a of the individual because of its importance in epidemic dynamics. It is clear, however, that similar containment procedures can be applied also on the basis of other social features. We will first formulate the feedback controlled SIR model in the deterministic case and subsequently extend our approach to the presence of uncertain parameters.",

More precisely, in the first test case we illustrate the behavior of the model in a simplified approach in the absence of uncertainty and social structure and without trying to reproduce scenarios closely related to current data. In the second test case, following a progressively more realistic approach, we consider the impact of the presence of uncertain data in the controlled model with homogeneous social mixing and calibrated on Italian data. The same setting is then considered in Test 3 taking into account the additional effect on the spreading of the infectious disease given by the social structure of the system described by suitable social interaction functions. The final scenario, explored in Test 4, examines the possibility of reducing the amplitude of the epidemic peak with the application of relaxed confinement measures related to the social structure of the system.",

On the other hand, by enlarging the activation time in combination with a sufficiently small penalty constant, the peak infection is not only reduced, but the total number of infected people is decreased. To achieve this, the control should be kept activated for a sufficiently long time and with the right intensity in a kind of plateau regime where there is a perfect balance between the containment effect and the spread of the disease.

Clearly, this choice involves a certain degree of arbitrariness since there are not yet sufficient studies on the subject, nevertheless, as we will see in the simulations, it is able to reproduce more realistic scenarios in terms of age distribution of the infected without altering the behaviour relative to the total number of infected. We divided the computation time frame into two zones and used different models in each zone, in accordance with the policy adopted by the Italian Government. The first time interval defines the period without any form of containment from 24 February to 9 March, the second the lockdown period from 9 March. In the first zone we adopted the uncontrolled model with homogeneous mixing for the estimation of epidemiological parameters. Hence, in the second zone we compute the evolution of the feedback controlled age dependent model (25)-(26) with matching (on average) interaction and recovery rates (32) and with the estimated control penalization \u03ba(t) as reported in Figure 6 until April 23rd. After April 23rd the computation advances in time using as penalization term the constant asymptotic value\u03ba reached by k(t).

This hypothesis allows to derive a model that contains the control action in feedback form based on the perception of the policy maker of the spread of the disease. Subsequently the model has been effectively solved in the presence of uncertain data, expanding the state variables into orthogonal polynomials in the uncertainty space, reducing the problem to a set of deterministic equations for the distribution of the solution through the course of the epidemic. The resulting controlled dynamic system then results in a deterministic stochastic solution that enables efficient estimation of uncertain parameters.",

By identifying some plausible scenarios in accordance with the literature, sustainable containment measures by the population based on the resumption of certain occupational activities characterized by specific age groups and social interaction matrices have been studied. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of such approaches based on the social structure of the system capable of achieving results similar to much more restrictive policies in reducing the risk that the virus may return to spread when the restrictions are lifted but at a significantly lower socio-economical cost.",
