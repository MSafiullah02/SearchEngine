Noninfected individuals associated with the outbreak premises were serologically negative, and no human-to-human transmission has been reported (Selvey et al., 1995) . Hendra virus was isolated from the oral cavity and urine of infected horses as well as in the urine of experimentally infected cats and guinea pigs (Williamson et al., 1998) .

Neutralizing antibodies for Hendra virus have been demonstrated in all four species of Pteropus in Australia, and the virus has been isolated from fetal tissue and uterine fluid of these bats (Young et al., 1996; Halpin et al., 2000) . However, there was no serological evidence of infection in persons with close and prolonged contact with bats (Selvey et al., 1996) . The mechanism by which the virus could have spread to horses is unknown, although it has been noted that the outbreaks occurred during the breeding season of the fruit bats. The isolation of the virus from fetal tissues and fluid suggests that contact with aborted fetuses and products of the birthing process could be a possible mechanism of transmission (Halpin et al., 2000) .",

Patients were originally thought to have Japanese encephalitis (JE) because it occurred in pig-farming villages, but distinguishing features included infection predominantly in adults rather than children, clustering of cases in members of the same home with an attack rate much higher than JE, a high proportion of patients in direct contact with pigs as opposed to unaffected individuals living in the same neighbourhood, a history of illness in the pigs belonging to the affected farmers, and the fact that many patients had prior immunization against JE Goh et al., 2000) . These observations were confirmed by case-control studies showing that patients had activities with more direct contact with pigs. Parashar et al. (2000) found that Nipah-infected patients were more likely than community farm controls (persons from farms without reported Nipah infection) to have ill/dying pigs (59% vs. 24%) and were more likely than case farm controls (persons from infected farms without illness) to have had activities requiring direct contact with pigs (86% vs. 50%). Other affected occupations included abattoir workers, pork sellers, as well as army personnel brought in to cull infected pigs Premalatha et al., 2000; Ali et al., 2001) . Exposure to ill animals other than pigs (e.g., dogs) were also reported in a few patients suggesting possible viral transmission from other animals Parashar et al., 2000) .",

However, in an MRI study of asymptomatic seropositive cases, MRI findings in the brain typical of Nipah infection was demonstrated in a nurse who had cared for Nipah-infected patients.

However, the Nipah virus was isolated from the urine of P. hypomelanus roosting in fruit trees in Tioman, an island off the east coast of Peninsular Malaysia . In the search for the natural host for Nipah virus, another new paramyxovirus was discovered in urine of P. hypomelanus as well: Tioman virus (Chua et al., 2001b) . The latter virus is as yet not known to cause any human or animal disease. In a serological survey of the inhabitants of Tioman Island, no individual was found to be seropositive for Nipah or Tioman antibodies, suggesting that direct viral transmission from bats to humans does not occur (Chong et al., 2003) .",

The ELISA tests for Nipah antibodies had a high specificity and are therefore useful screening tests . In the Malaysian outbreak, the rate of positive IgM was 60% to 70% by the 4th day and 100% by the 12th day of illness. IgG antibody was 100% positive by the 25th day of illness (Ramasundrum et al., 2000) . Prior to the complete characterization of the virus, Nipah virus was suspected to be \"Hendra-like\" because cells infected with Nipah virus reacted strongly to anti-Hendra antibodies. Nipah and Hendra viruses shared enough epitopes for Hendra viral antigens to be used in the prototype serologic test sensitive enough to detect Nipah virus antigens (CDC, 1999a) . Viral isolation is not routinely carried out as Nipah virus is classified as a biosafety level 4 agent and requires specialized facilities. However, the virus was isolated from CSF, urine, and respiratory secretions of patients during the Malaysian outbreak (Chua et al., 2000b . Direct visualization by electron microscopy in negatively stained CSF specimens was found to be useful but unable to differentiate between Nipah and Hendra viruses (Chow et al., 2000) . In cell cultures, it was possible to differentiate between the various paramyxoviruses using features such as the types and distribution of nucleocapsid aggregates and viral envelope differences. The presence of single-fringe viral envelope and peripherally distributed, type 1 nucleocapsid is characteristic of Nipah virus (Hyatt et al., 2001) .",

Ribavirin was administered orally initially and then intravenously, when available, to those who were unable to take it orally. In a comparison of 140 treated patients with 54 untreated patients serving as historical controls (i.e., those who developed the illness before ribavirin was made available), it was found that fewer treated patients died (32% vs. 54%, p = 0.011), suggesting that ribavirin reduced the mortality of patients (Chong et al., 2001a ). However, it was possible that treated patients who were seen later in the outbreak were also given better general medical care than untreated patients seen earlier, as physicians became more experienced in the outbreak.",

In the one autopsy case studied, vasculitis, perivascular cuffing, and necrotic plaques were not seen and instead viral inclusions were much more extensive and prominent, occupying the entire neuronal cytoplasm as well as being abundant in the neuropil.

Although the surveys in Australia and Malaysia showed no evidence of direct viral transmission from bats to humans (Selvey et al., 1996; Chong et al., 2003) , the appearance of Nipah outbreaks in Bangladesh (Hsu et al., 2004; ICCDR, B, 2004; Quddus et al., 2004; WHO, 2004) , with no apparent intermediate animal host and possible human-to-human transmission, makes it an all the more important question to answer.
