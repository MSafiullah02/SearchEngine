Over 100 health workers have lost their lives to COVID\u221219, a tragedy to the world and a barrier to fight against the disease (15) . Guidelines for healthcare workers and online refresher courses have been developed by WHO, CDC, and various governmental organizations in various countries to boost the knowledge and prevention strategies (16) . There is paucity of literature on KAPs of HCWs toward the COVID-19 pandemic. However, a study with majorly Asian HCWs and medical students revealed that they had insufficient knowledge about COVID-19 but had a positive attitude toward prevention of COVID-19 transmission (17) . To our knowledge, no study has been done in sub-Saharan Africa to assess KAPs toward COVID-19 specifically among HCWs.

However, this score is much lower than that reported in Chinese general population (90%) (19) but slightly higher than the KAP toward COVID-19 among US residents (80%) (24) . This is possibly because the Chinese and the US studies assessed COVID-19 symptoms using one direct question rather than asking the participants to choose from multiple options. Generally, majority of the HCWs had sufficient knowledge about COVID-19 which is in line with findings in Vietnam about COVID-19 (25 (25) . Further education and training through continuous professional education and journal clubs, particularly on symptoms and transmission are essential in improving the knowledge of HCW about COVID-19 in our setting. In our study, most of the participants used information from international and governmental media (websites and verified social media pages). Our study suggests that knowledge on COVID-19 was significant among HCWs who used news media such as televisions. This suggests that such media should be frequently used to disseminate information on COVID-19 by the stakeholders.

Majority of the HCWs are following infection prevention and control practices recommended by the Ministry of Health Uganda and WHO. These include regular hand hygiene, social distancing and wearing a face mask when in high risk situations. Ninetythree percent and 96% of HCWs reported wearing a face mask when in contact with patients and washing hands before/after handling patients. These are very vital practices to prevent transfer of COVID-19 from patients to patients and to the HCWs themselves. However, up to 60% of HCWs admitted having avoided patients with symptoms suggestive of COVID-19. This can be attributed to shortage of personal protective equipment which has become a global problem (31) (32) (33) .",

The questions have been formulated from WHO and CDC guidelines and reports on COVID-19 (12) . Secondly, only HCWs in Makerere University Teaching Hospitals were surveyed and the results of this study may not reflect the KAPs of HCWs in the entire country. However, this is the first study to assess KAPs, can be used to formulate targeted Continuing Medical Education (CME) for HCWs and enrolled in a countrywide survey and training on COVID. A similar study may be extended to the community. The study also had a low response rate (23%), which has been documented in web-based surveys especially among professionals (34) and this limits the survey's generalization.",

Knowledge on COVID-19 was significantly higher among HCWs who used news media such as televisions and newspapers and those aged 18-39 were more knowledgeable about COVID-19. There was no statistically significant difference in the level of knowledge about COVID-19 among health care workers in Uganda irrespective of their professions or qualifications. About four-fifth of the respondents had poor attitude toward COVID-19 and just over 70% of the HCWs had good practices toward COVID-19 especially those aged 40 years or more. Continued professional education is advised among HCWs in Uganda to improve knowledge of HCWs hence averting negative attitudes and promoting positive preventive and therapeutic practices. We recommend follow up studies involving teaching and non-teaching hospitals across the country.",
