Three kinds of SARS-related networks were constructed and analyzed, including the patient contact network, the weighted location (district) network, and the weighted occupation network. We demonstrate that a network-based data analysis framework can help evaluate various control strategies. For instance, in the case of SARS, a general randomized immunization control strategy may not be effective. Instead, a strategy that focuses on nodes (e.g., patients, locations, or occupations) with high degree and strength may lead to more effective outbreak control and management.",

However, with SARS being a unique and highly contagious airborne epidemic disease, personal contacts uncovered in the patient surveys or interviews alone may not provide sufficient information to fully explain the transmission patterns. As such, in an exploratory attempt, we also constructed two additional networks: a location/district network and an occupation network to further illustrate the spreading of the SARS epidemic in various parts of Beijing and among different occupational categories. We study these two networks as \"weighted networks,\" with the weight w ij defined over an directed edge from node i to j given as the total number of the infectious links from i to j. Further, we study node \"strength\" s i defined as s i = N j=1 w ij for node i, where N is the total number of nodes in the network [7] . This strength measure can be indicative of the ability to spread the disease from a given node.",

This is of particular importance in epidemiology since in this case the expected reproductive number may be unbounded [12] . In epidemiology, the reproductive number is defined as the number of secondary infections generated by one patient. This concept plays a key role in understanding the dynamic process of epidemics and in evaluating impact of control measures on the spread of infection [13] . Fig. 1 shows that the SARS contact network also follows a power-law distribution. The blue line corresponds to a power-law tail P (k) \u223c k \u2212\u03b3 with \u03b3 = 2.8076. Not surprisingly, this result shows that the SARS infectious network is a scale-free network, with the implication that the expected reproductive number can be unbounded. A public health implication of this finding is that the traditional disease control approach based on random immunization (which has been shown to be effective in many epidemic outbreaks [8] ) may not be effective (unless, of course, the entire population can be treated), because untreated hubs, albeit small in number, can still lead to rapid and large-scale infections [8] . Instead, an alternative control method targeting at containing highly connected nodes can be much more effective. ",

Since the records in our nine-week SARS dataset are timestamped, we are able to observe the evolution of the SARS patient contact network over time. We plot three weekly \"snapshots\" of the contact network in Fig. 2 . The node degree in the contact network can be used to measure the node's disease spreading ability [2] . Fig. 3 (a) and (b) plot the average and maximum degrees for 9 consecutive weeks, respectively. We notice that in the first two weeks, the contact network has a relatively high average and maximum degree. These measures start to decrease with time after Week 5. This decrease can be attributed (at least partially) to several strong control measures implemented by the government after April 14, 2003 (which is in Week 5).",

We define the component ratio as the number of connected components divided by the total number of nodes in the network. From Fig. 4 , we observe that in the first two weeks, the ratio is relatively small. After some fluctuations in the next two weeks, it starts to increase gradually. Part of this observation is due to the fact that, during the first few weeks, most SARS patients were misdiagnosed as having tuberculosis [15] . The isolation and quarantine controls were not enforced for these patients during this initial period of outbreak. After April 14, 2008, as strong control measures were taken, the epidemic was brought under control.",

The patient contact network possesses the scale-free degree distribution and its temporal evolution (as measured by average degree, maximum degree, and component ratio) exhibits some interesting patterns that can be explained by various control measures implemented during the SARS outbreak in Beijing. In both weighted district and occupation networks, the weights follow right-skewed distributions and the strengths of nodes are strongly correlated to their degrees. These observations and analysis results indicate that the traditional random isolation control method may not be effective. Instead, a more effective control program should target at nodes with high degree and strength.",
