The bulk of duplication and segregation events occur in S and M phases. During S phase, both DNA and centrosomes are duplicated (Fig. 1). Duplicated centrosomes separate in order to form the poles of the mitotic spindle responsible for segregating sister chromatids (Fig. 1). Sister chromatid segregation is initiated during M phase, or mitosis (Fig. 1).\n\n",

Although no overt cellular changes or events are observed during G1 and G2, cells are interpreting signals from their extracellular and intracellular environments to ensure that conditions are appropriate for cellular division events. In early G1, cells interpret extracellular signals (e.g., nutrient abundance, mating pheromone) to decide whether to commit to a new cell cycle. Following this point of commitment (called START in Saccharomyces cerevisiae), cells prepare for entry into S phase by activating the expression of genes required for duplicating DNA and centrosomes (Fig. 1). In G2, cells interpret intracellular signals from checkpoint pathways that monitor whether duplication events have been completed with fidelity, and whether the mitotic spindle apparatus is functional.",

In turn, each of these complex events must be coordinately controlled with the other events. What, then, are the mechanisms that orchestrate the complex set of events required for cellular division? Over the past three decades, an overwhelming number of studies have identified and characterized two proteins that act in a complex to trigger cell cycle events: cyclins and cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs). Both biochemical and genetic approaches have shown that, throughout the cell cycle, CDKs are activated by different cyclins, whose role is to activate and inhibit different events at the proper time and in the proper order (reviewed in [1\u20133]). More recently, it has been shown that up to a fifth of the S. cerevisiae genome, including cyclins themselves, is transcribed once per cell cycle [4\u20137]. This set of genes is often referred to as the cell cycle-regulated transcriptional program. The precise nature of this temporal transcriptional program may serve as another mechanism to ensure proper timing and ordering of cell cycle events.",

However, recent studies have shown that cell cycle-regulated transcription has the capacity to occur largely in the absence of CDKs [5, 12]. These findings suggest that some other regulatory mechanism is responsible for controlling periodic transcription and coordinating cell cycle events. To better understand and characterize this control module, single gene studies have given way to genome-wide experimental approaches that measure global gene expression dynamics [4\u20137]. These studies require unbiased quantitative analyses tailored both to the experimental method and to the overarching biological question. Here, we will discuss both current and future experimental and analytical methods used to address the seemingly simple questions: What portion of the genome is cell cycle-regulated? And how is this transcription program coordinated with other cell cycle events?",

            "text": "With the advent of modern molecular biology, measuring mRNA levels in cells became a regular test to address whether genes are regulated at the transcriptional level. For genes involved in the cell cycle, understanding gene regulation at the transcriptional level requires measuring mRNA abundance over time in synchronous populations of cells as they progress through the cell cycle. Histones were the first genes identified whose expression oscillates periodically during the cell cycle [13]. Classifying histone gene expression as cell cycle-regulated was done by correlating the timing of histone mRNA expression with the timing of DNA replication over the course of several cell cycles [13]. Over the following decade, ten more genes involved in cell cycle events were also identified as being expressed in a periodic manner\u2014HO [14], CDC21 [15], CDC9 [16], RAD6 [17], SWI5 [18], CDC8 [19], POL1 [20], DBF4 [21], PRI1 [22], and DBF2 [23]. For each of these genes, the definition of periodic is anchored to the correlation of gene expression with an observable cell cycle event that is known to occur only once per cycle. The periodic expression of these genes was discovered while investigating the function of each gene during cell cycle events. Is periodic expression of cell cycle genes a global phenomenon or specific to just a small set of genes? In total, approximately 100 periodically expressed budding yeast genes were identified one at a time using northern blots. However, a technology that is able to measure transcript dynamics at a genome-wide level was necessary not only to quantify the proportion of genes that is periodically transcribed but also to understand how cell cycle-regulated transcription is coordinated with cell cycle progression.",

Additional studies in fission yeast and human cells have measured gene expression dynamics in synchronized cells to determine the scope of periodic transcription in these organisms. In fission yeast, three genome-wide studies identified a limited number of periodic genes [26\u201328]. Unlike budding yeast, fewer genes were classified as cell cycle-regulated; less than 800 genes were identified by each study. Similar to budding yeast, the consensus between studies is very low, with only 171 genes shared between all analyses [26\u201328]. Two studies in human cell lines have classified fewer than 1,000 periodic genes [29, 30]. The low numbers of periodic genes may be due to the larger genome size, undetected alternative splicing of introns, or the difficulty involved in synchronizing fission yeast or human cell lines. While budding yeast has the largest number of identified periodic genes, cell cycle-regulated transcription is also clearly observed in fission yeast and human cell lines, suggesting that this phenomenon is conserved between organisms. Moreover, the transcriptional regulation of some orthologs in the evolutionarily diverged yeast species S. cerevisiae and S. pombe have been shown to be conserved [31]. With improved experimental approaches and mRNA measuring technology, the characterization of periodic gene expression will become more tractable in other model systems.",

This concept is often referred to as \u201cjust in time\u201d transcription, in which gene products that function at a specific cell cycle interval are expressed only when needed (Fig. 2a) (reviewed in [10, 32, 33]). A variation on this first explanation has been referred to as the \u201cSleeping Beauty\u201d situation, which takes into account the full lifetime of a cell or tissue, rather than the completion of a single cell cycle ([7], reviewed in [9]). Whether it is a single budding yeast or a population of cells that form tissues in an organism, active cellular division occurs during only a portion of a cell\u2019s overall life cycle. Microorganisms are subject to environmental constraints and will divide when conditions (nutrients, temperature, growth factor signaling, etc.) permit, but not when the local environment is not amenable to cell division. Therefore, much of the life of a single cell is spent outside the cell cycle, in a state of rest or quiescence. However, once a signal is received to initiate cellular division, the cells are poised to complete cell cycle events with the proper genes expressed at the correct time.\n\n",

For example, proteins required for DNA replication are loaded onto DNA in different stages. The components of the replication complex are periodically transcribed themselves, lending to the temporal events that are required for DNA replication. A pre-initiation complex first binds to DNA replication origins and is only activated when elements are phosphorylated by S-phase cyclin/CDK. Other components required for replication are then synthesized, recruited to origins, and replicate DNA (reviewed in [34]). Further, mitotic cyclin/CDK activity inhibits the reformation of pre-initiation complexes until the following cell cycle [35]. This mechanism ensures that the complex required to trigger DNA replication is only built once and thus acts as a layer of control to prevent re-replication.",

First, many of the TFs that play a role in controlling cell cycle-regulated transcription are themselves periodically transcribed (reviewed in [11]). For TFs that act in complexes, at least one TF is periodically expressed. This observation suggests that a portion of genes may be cell cycle-regulated due to the periodic expression of their regulators. Second, cyclin/CDK activity has been found to affect the activity of many of these transcription factors. In these cases, cyclins that are expressed during any of these phases have the capacity to affect TF activity (Table 1). Additionally, this regulation can be either activating or inhibitory depending on the TF (Table 1). These findings, coupled with cyclin deletion experiments, imply that cell cycle-regulated gene expression is also modulated by cyclin/CDK activity [40\u201342]. Finally, genome-wide binding data have shown that these TFs also bind to the promoters of other TFs shown to regulate periodic gene expression [8, 43, 44]. In fact, TFs expressed late in the cell cycle have been shown to bind to the promoters of TFs responsible for early periodic gene expression [45]. This finding demonstrates that the TFs controlling the last wave of periodic transcription may also activate the first TFs in the following cycle. Taken together with global views of transcript dynamics from microarray experiments [7], it was proposed that a TF network could account for the periodic nature of the TFs themselves and the entire periodic transcription program ([8, 44], reviewed in [9\u201311]). Models for how the TF network is integrated with cyclin/CDK activity and cell cycle events will be discussed below.",

            "text": "Concurrent with passage through START and the commitment to the cell cycle, the heterodimeric TFs SBF and MBF activate a large program of periodic genes involved in budding, centrosome duplication, and DNA replication. SBF and MBF share a trans-activating subunit, Swi6 [46], and each have a distinct DNA-binding subunit, Swi4 and Mbp1, respectively [47, 48]. Activation of SBF and MBF centers on feedback loops that include G1 cyclin/CDKs and the transcriptional co-repressor Whi5 [40, 41, 49, 50] (Fig. 3). Activation begins when Cln3/Cdk1 phosphorylates Whi5, triggering its dissociation from SBF complexes and the activation of transcription of SBF targets. Two of these targets are the genes encoding the G1-cyclins; Cln1 and Cln2. Cln1/Cdk1 and Cln2/Cdk1 kinase complexes also phosphorylate Whi5, triggering further dissociation from SBF complexes and export from the nucleus. Following activation, a series of transcriptional repressors and B-type cyclins inactivate SBF and MBF in a series of negative feedback loops. SBF activates the YOX1 and YHP1 genes, and in turn, their gene products repress the transcription of the gene encoding the SBF component, Swi4 [51]. Moreover, SBF transcriptional activity is repressed by Clb2 [52], after a cascade of transcriptional activation that triggered the expression of the CLB2 gene (Fig. 3). The transcriptional activity of MBF is modulated by its direct target and co-repressor NRM1 [53] (Fig. 3). Thus, positive feedback loops contribute to the full activation of SBF and MBF, while negative feedback loops serve as the \u201cOFF switch\u201d for their activity.",

            "text": "SBF and MBF transmit a transcriptional signal to activator Hcm1 [54] that is responsible for expression of genes required for chromosome segregation, centrosome dynamics, and budding during late S phase [6] (Fig. 3). HCM1 is periodically transcribed, and its protein levels are also periodic, closely mirroring the behavior of HCM1 mRNA [6]. Moreover, Hcm1 activates the synthesis of the SBF co-repressor WHI5 and Swi-five factor (SFF) subunit NDD1 [6] (Fig. 3). SFF, a TF complex composed of Fkh1, Fkh2, Ndd1, and Mcm1 [55\u201359], activates a set of periodic genes referred to as the \u201cCLB2 cluster\u201d during G2/M phase ([7, 60], reviewed in [9\u201311]). SFF activity is modulated through a positive feedback loop with the B-type cyclin Clb2 [52]. SFF activates CLB2 gene transcription [60], which in turn binds CDK and further stimulates components of SFF to increase its transcriptional activity [61\u201363] (Fig. 3). SFF transmits the periodic transcriptional signal by activating transcription of genes encoding TFs ACE2 and SWI5 [60] (Fig. 3). Ace2 and Swi5 share a number of targets (Ace2 also activates a number of unique targets only in daughter cells) and activate periodic transcripts involved in the transition between late M phase and the beginning of early G1 of the subsequent cell cycle. While Ace2 and Swi5 are transcribed during G2/M, their activity is inhibited by Clb2/CDK-dependent cytoplasmic sequestration [64, 65]. Mitosis triggers the destruction of Clb2, and thus, Swi5 and Ace2 can return to the nucleus and bind to the promoters of their target genes. Swi5 and Ace2 bind to the promoter of CLN3 to activate CLN3 expression and thus begin a new cycle of transcription [45] (Fig. 3). Currently, these TFs, in addition to other TFs that potentially regulate periodic transcription, are being further studied to better understand the connections with each other and with cyclin/CDKs.",

The first study to address this question measured the effect of S phase and mitotic cyclin/CDKs on periodic transcription by deleting all six of these cyclins (clb1,2,3,4,5,6) in budding yeast. These cells are kept alive by the inducible overexpression of Clb1; in the absence of Clb1, cells arrest due to the absence of all S-phase and mitotic cyclin/CDK activity, resulting in their inability to initiate DNA replication, centrosome duplication, or mitosis. However, the arrested cells continue to carry out G1 events, including budding and G1-specific transcription [66]. What happens to the rest of the periodic transcriptional program in these cells? In a synchronous population of early G1 cells lacking all S-phase and mitotic cyclins (synchronized by centrifugal elutriation), global gene expression dynamics were measured by microarray. Strikingly, compared to the expression dynamics of genes normally periodic in wild-type cells, 70 % of genes remain periodic in the absence of both S-phase and mitotic cyclins and in the absence of cell cycle progression, with a period very similar to normally cycling cells [5]. These findings suggest that S-phase and mitotic CDKs are not required for the execution of the majority of the cell cycle-transcriptional program, and that this program can continue to oscillate even in arrested cells.",

Model simulations indicated that the TF network itself could sustain oscillation independent of S-phase and mitotic cyclin/CDKs and cell cycle progression [5].

What is the effect that cyclin/CDK feedback acting on TF activity has on transcriptional oscillations? Comparing transcriptional dynamics reveals that the overall amplitude of periodic gene expression dynamics decreases as cyclin/CDK activity is removed [12]. Additionally, the period of transcriptional oscillations also increase with decreasing cyclin/CDK activity [12]. These observations suggest that cyclin/CDK activity plays an important role in regulating the amplitude and period of transcriptional oscillations. In addition to cyclin/CDK feedback on the TF network, cyclins themselves are periodically transcribed (reviewed in [9\u201311, 33]). Yet in the absence of CDK activity, cell cycle progression is halted. A study showed that in the absence of all S-phase and mitotic cyclins, except for a single S-phase cyclin, periodic cycles of DNA replication occur together with transcriptional activation of the S-phase cyclin [12]. This observation implies that cyclin/CDK activity also acts as an effector of the TF network oscillator.",

A TF network acts as an oscillator that drives the timing of periodic transcription, including transcription of cyclin genes. Cyclins (in complex with CDKs) then feedback onto the TF network via phosphorylation to contribute robust transcriptional oscillations. Phosphorylation of a TF is capable of enhancing or reducing transactivation of the TF\u2019s target genes, thus \u201cfine-tuning\u201d the TF network output during the cell cycle. Additionally, cyclin/CDKs also act as effectors of the TF network to trigger cell cycle events in the proper order (Fig. 4). This model is different from previous cell cycle models in that a TF network, rather than cyclin/CDK activity, acts as the oscillator that keeps the timing and ordering of cell cycle progression, and functions to control the temporal program of transcription. Although the mechanism by which the timing of cell cycle oscillations is different, the process by which cell cycle events are triggered by cyclin/CDKs is not different. The activation of different events in the proper order is dependent both on transcriptional oscillations and cyclin/CDK activity. However, it remains to be determined how a TF network oscillator is coupled to other cell cycle events and cyclin/CDK activity.\n\n",

Although this method was able to classify a number of genes as periodically transcribed, the major limitation of northern blotting is scalability. Northern blotting is limited to testing only a handful of genes at a time. So while it was useful for asking whether any specific gene might be cell cycle-regulated, it was not a particularly useful tool for discovering new periodic genes. Additionally, because only a small number of genes could be assayed on each blot, the temporal and quantitative relationships between all periodic genes could not be determined. Thus, a global view of the program and the regulatory mechanisms that governed them could not be easily discerned by this approach. Often, a gene was defined as periodically transcribed if dynamics matched the period of observable events. For example, histones were shown to be transcribed in concert with DNA replication during every cell cycle [13].",

First, the methods to synchronize populations of cells varied between each study, resulting in starting populations that were released from a variety of cell cycle phases. Depending on the starting population, periodic mRNAs expressed during cell cycle phases immediately following release may be more synchronous than those mRNAs in later cell-cycle phases as populations become more asynchronous. This observation may be due to the following factors: (1) normally cycling cells complete cellular division at different rates and (2) different synchronizations result in starting populations that vary in level of synchrony [31]. Second, each research group used different microarrays with different sets of oligos to represent the budding yeast genome. These differences may play a role in discrepancies between mRNA measurements. Third, the method of labeling and hybridizing mRNAs to the chips varied between the groups, which may result in differences in the quantification of mRNA levels. Fourth, Spellman and colleagues and Pramila and colleagues hybridized mRNA from an asynchronous population of cells labeled with a different fluorescent probe to each chip as a control in addition to the synchronized pools of labeled mRNA [6, 7]. This was meant as a way to control for differences across different microarray chips. Alternatively, Cho and colleagues and Orlando and colleagues only hybridized the synchronized pools of mRNA to each chip [4, 5]. This approach generates a direct measure of mRNA levels relative to other time points from the synchronized time course. Finally, each group used different methods to normalize the microarrays with each other for consistent measures of gene expression both within and across microarrays, which can affect the resulting dynamic range of expression measurements. An important factor to consider is the differences in experimental approaches that measure and quantify gene expression dynamics when comparing the various studies centered on identifying cell cycle-regulated transcription.",

Similar yet distinct definitions of periodic are embedded within each of the different methods applied to identify cell cycle-regulated transcripts. As described in Subheading 2.1, these four groups exploited different methods to classify a set of periodic genes. Two features play prominent roles in describing periodicity; each method integrates these features differently. The first feature addresses the oscillatory nature of gene expression dynamics. Whether by visual inspection or by some quantitative approach, a necessary component of any of these analyses requires identifying genes that are expressed once per cell cycle across multiple cycles. The second feature addresses the dynamic range of the queried genes. This attribute is much more subjective in nature, as it is unclear what minimum dynamic range is above stochastic noise within a synchronous population of cells. Additional quantitative methods exist to measure the periodicity of gene expression dynamics and define periodic behavior in a variety of ways [70]. Therefore, it is important to have an understanding of how you want to define periodic genes and select a computational algorithm that best matches your assumptions.",

First, RNA-seq requires much less starting RNA. This is advantageous when studying a system in which cells are in short supply. Second, RNA-seq allows for measuring the abundance of multiple transcript isoforms. This benefit is especially helpful in organisms that possess introns because microarrays usually do not distinguish between different splice variants of the same transcribed gene. Finally, RNA-seq has a much larger dynamic range compared to gene expression microarrays [71]. A major drawback of current RNA-seq methodologies is the lack of standardized normalization approaches, especially in time-series experiments. This drawback is critical when comparing time points across the cell cycle.

The use of the GAL-inducible promoter, among others, allows a researcher to turn on gene expression of a TF and then monitor the effect on target genes.

To construct an estradiol-induction system, a Gal4-DNA binding domain was fused to the human estrogen receptor [77, 78]. The addition of estradiol hormone results in the localization of the fusion protein to the nucleus and binding to Gal4 transcriptional targets. This massive shift in localization leads to the rapid binding of Gal4 targets without concern for protein level thresholds for transactivation. McIsaac and colleagues employed microarrays to monitor temporal changes in global transcription in asynchronous populations and found that the targets of Gal4 transactivation were quickly upregulated, as soon as 5 min after estradiol treatment [79]. By sampling mRNA levels at several time points after induction, one can determine direct transcriptional targets and observe the activation/repression dynamics. Using a similar system, one can identify the targets of many of the yeast cell-cycle TFs employing an induction system in asynchronous populations of cells and monitoring the first genes to respond, thus identifying the direct targets of the TF. The forced expression of these targets should be readily detectable over the background expression in an asynchronous population (low amplitude changes may require cell cycle synchronization to be observed).",

However, recent work on temporal dynamics of nucleosome binding at promoters suggests that TFs can actually induce nucleosome position changes once they bind a site, while some sites which are \u201caccessible\u201d to TFs remain transcriptionally inactive [80]. These experiments help to build a model describing the transactions at a promoter. By correlation, this information can be associated with expression timing and provide additional information to describe mechanisms of gene activation and repression during the cell cycle.

Critically, a formidable problem for these technologies is the improvement of the sequencing accuracy which currently sits at ~85 % for PacBio sequencing and ~75\u201390 % for Nanopore sequencing [83, 84]. With these accuracy rates, the possibility that a read does not identify the correct gene is substantial. Recently, it has been shown that aligning single molecule sequencing with reads from amplification based sequencing (such as Illumina) greatly enhances the accuracy of single molecule sequencing while still allowing for quantitation to be performed in a no-amplification manner, increasing the viability of the technology, but increasing the cost and effort involved [85, 86].

To eliminate this problem, many have made use of RNA fluorescence in situ hybridization, or RNA-FISH [87]. RNA-FISH uses a fluorophore-conjugated nucleotide probe to detect target RNAs in fixed cells. The foci generated by the probe are visualized by microscopy, and each focus represents an mRNA contained within a cell at that moment. Barcoding FISH probes and ultraresolution microscopy has lead to the potential for identifying and quantifying more transcripts than available fluorophore colors [88, 89]. Using RNA-FISH, one can determine the actual number of transcripts at a time point in a single cell. Observing multiple cells, one can determine the range of transcript abundance at a given time in a collection of single cells, which helps understand the distribution of RNA abundance in a population in a way that cannot be determined using methods that rely on purified RNA from a population of cells (microarray, RNA-seq, etc.).",

Since the introduction of the system, it has been effectively used in a variety of eukaryotes and expanded to a two-color system [94, 95]. Still, live-cell imaging using reporters has typically shied away from quantitation and has been used more extensively for localization experiments. The RNA hairpin-binding approach is, so far, relatively unproven in systems where mRNA levels are dynamically regulated over time (though some efforts have been made to quantify mRNA by foci in prokaryotes [96, 97]). For example, the ASH1 experiment described above observed mRNA localization dynamics, not abundance. A major limitation of probing mRNAs by FISH or by hairpin-binding proteins is the introduction of bias to the analysis while limiting scale. Using these methods, an experimenter can only determine the transcript levels of the specific mRNAs that they have targeted for analysis. Therefore, examining correlation or coherence with other transcripts is not yet possible with this approach. In time, the ability to multiplex probes may expand the experimental arsenal of probe targets. Certainly, with advances in fluorescent probe development and live cell imaging, the potential remains for RNA binding probes to yield fruitful results in the field of cell cycle transcription.
