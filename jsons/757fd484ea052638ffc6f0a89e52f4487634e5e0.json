Eventually, the endotracheal tube was feasibly removed after intubation for 18 days and subsequently replaced with noninvasive ventilation and a high-flow nasal cannula oxygen therapy. Intensive airway care alongside psychological and rehabilitative therapies can shorten the mechanical ventilation time and improve the prognosis of COVID-19 sufferers.",

The CT on the 9th day after admission indicates that pulmonary lesions increased further and that fusion and consolidation of lesions occurred in the pulmonary lower parts. As the patient's condition was getting worse, on the 14th day after admission intubation and mechanical ventilation were conducted, a large dose of sedation, analgesics and muscle medicine was given, the ARDS's lung protective ventilation strategy (including ventilation in prone position) was performed, and anti-viral and anti-infection therapies were executed. On the 23th day after admission, the patient's oxygenation index increased to 228 (see Table S1 in Supplementary information for more details), indicating that the patient was getting better, and thus we gradually reduced the amount of sedative drugs and lowered the parameters of the ventilator. On the 25th day after admission, she exhibited anxiety, fear and serious human-machine confrontation. On the 27th day after admission, the chest CT results indicate that the pulmonary lesions were more sprawling than ever since the admission and even consolidated considerably and that an air bronchogram could be observed in the pulmonary middle area.

(1) Respiratory airway care should be intensified. This patient is obese, and her thorax activities are thus restricted; more importantly, the chest CT on February 17 shows consolidation in the pulmonary lower parts but an obvious air bronchogram, suggesting that the respiratory airway might be blocked; furthermore, this hypothesis is consistent with the autopsy report [8] that a plethora of sticky secretions overflows from the alveoli in the pulmonary transection and some fibrous stripes are visible; in addition, the radiographically ground-glass opacity is compatible with the anatomically pulmonary gray-white lesions [8], implying that COVID-19 causes the inflammatory reactions featured mainly by damage in the deep airway and pulmonary alveoli. Hence, it is exceedingly critical to widen the congested respiratory airway in the later therapeutic processes to promote the expectoration of mucus. (2) Attention to the patient's psychological and physical rehabilitation in the later phase should also be paid. The COVID-19 patients are per se scared of the disease, and moreover, long-term high-dose use of sedative and analgesic medicine readily leads to delirium and restlessness once discontinuation; therefore, psychotropic drugs (e.g., alprazolam, flupentixol and melitracen tablets) should also be administrated besides bolstering psychological comfort. Additionally, the muscle disuse atrophy syndrome will readily appear if patients are bedridden for a long time, and thus timely rehabilitations, ",
