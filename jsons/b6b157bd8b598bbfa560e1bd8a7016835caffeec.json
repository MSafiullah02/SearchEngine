In the absence of effective drugs and vaccines, the Chinese government implemented stringent non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) 1 , which included active case detection and isolation of infected persons, maintaining social distance, closure of schools and universities and most businesses, working from home where possible, quarantining and monitoring close contacts, and releasing multi-media epidemic and protection information. These measures effectively contained China's COVID-19 epidemic by March 2020. 2",

Stringent NPI measures not only prevented huaman to human transmission of COVID-19 but also played a positive role in preventing influenza.According to the World Health Organization, the basic measures for protecting against COVID-19 are similar to those for influenza: frequent hand-washing; social distancing; avoid touching the eyes, nose, and mouth; and wearing a face mask when appropriate.5 China's multi-media prevention and control programme and the widespread public panic in response to the COVID-19 epidemic resulted in very high compliance. In conclusion, the government's prevention and control measures in January to March 2020 not only contained the COVID-19 outbreak but also reduced the spread of influenza.",
