The fecal-hand route of transmission is also critical. Perhaps the most insidious and difficult to control is the consumption of raw poultry and meat products by workers in farms and processing plants. Many people in agriculture are living on subsistence or below-subsistence wages and consume products off the processing lines. Many of these products are not fully processed and may contact pathogens that have not been killed through cooking or irradiation (see Chapter 2) (Table 27 .1) (3, 4) .",

Immunohistochemical assays for orthopoxviruses demonstrated abundant viral antigens in surface epithelial cells of lesions in conjunctiva and tongue, with lesser amounts in adjacent macrophages, fibroblasts, and connective tissues. Viral antigens in the lung were abundant in bronchial epithelial cells, macrophages, and fibroblasts.

Fever, diarrhea and abdominal pain are the most common clinical features. The stools frequently contain mucus and, a few days after the onset of symptoms, frank blood. Significant vomiting and dehydration are uncommon. A rapid presumptive laboratory diagnosis may be made during the acute phase of the illness by direct phase-contrast microscopy of stools. Isolation of the organism from stools requires culture in a selective medium containing antibiotics and incubation under reduced oxygen tension at 42\u02daC. The organism persists in the stools of untreated patients for up to 7 weeks following the onset of symptoms. Erythromycin may produce a rapid clinical and bacteriologic cure and should be used to treat moderately to severely ill patients as well as patients with compromised host defenses (14) .",

In humans, the incubation period is 6 to 48 hours and produces headache, malaise, nausea, fever, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea (with and without blood). Salmonella is also capable of invading the intestinal mucosa, entering the blood stream, and causing septicemia, shock, and death. The diagnosis is made through the clinical presentation and confirmation with blood and stool cultures and serology. Treatment is first started empirically pending culture results and then adjusted if necessary.

Studies demonstrate that proximity to free-range domestic poultry increases children's risk of infection with diarrhea-causing organisms such as Campylobacter jejuni. Corralling might reduce the risk, but research on the socioeconomic acceptability of corralling is lacking. Many people report that home-grown poultry and eggs taste better and are more nutritious. They enjoy living around animals and want to teach their children about raising animals. To prevent theft, some residents shut their birds in provisional enclosures at night but allege that birds are healthier, happier, and produce better meat and eggs when let loose by day. Many rural peoples view bird feces in the house and yard as dirty, but few see a connection to illness. Residents consider chicks and ducklings more innocuous than adult birds and are more likely to allow them inside the house and permit children to play with them. Additional food and water costs with corralling are a significant obstacle for some. Adequate space and corral hygiene must also be addressed to make this intervention viable. Developing a secure, acceptable, and affordable corral remains a challenge for rural populations (33, 34) .",

No environmental studies of source hatcheries were completed. A case-control study was performed by comparing culture-confirmed Salmonella infantis in Michigan residents, identified between May and July 1999, with two age-and neighborhood-matched controls. Eighty environmental and bird tissue samples were collected from an implicated hatchery; all salmonella isolates underwent pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis. The study included 19 case-patients sharing the same PFGE subtype and 37 matched controls. Within 5 days before illness onset, 74% of case-patients resided in households raising young poultry compared with 16% of controls (matched OR 19.5; 95% CI 2.9, 378.1). Eight hatchery samples yielded S. infantis with PFGE subtypes matching the patients' isolates. This investigation identified birds from a single hatchery as the source of human illness and confirmed the link by matching PFGE patterns from humans, birds and the hatchery environment. Subsequent public health interventions reduced, but did not eliminate, transmission of poultry-associated salmonellosis. Five additional PFGE-linked cases were identified in spring 2000, necessitating quarantine of the hatchery for depopulation, cleaning and disinfection (35) .",

(40) Captive reptiles (such as iguanas) are routinely identified as reservoirs of Salmonella and the number of reports about reptile-associated salmonellosis is increasing. In Germany and Austria, salmonella was detected in 54.1% of fecal reptile samples cultured. The percentage of salmonella-positive samples was significantly lower in turtles as compared with lizards and snakes, as salmonella was only detected in one sample from a single turtle out of 38 turtles investigated. In all, 42 different salmonella serovars were found. All isolated salmonella belonged to the species enterica, predominantly to the subspecies I (n = 46) and IIIb (n = 30) but also to subspecies II (n = 3), IIIa (n = 6), and IV (n = 2). All isolates were sensitive to the antimicrobials examined.
