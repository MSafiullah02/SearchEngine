            "text": "Background: Low cardiac output syndrome (LCOS) is an important complication of cardiac surgery. It is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. The incidence of LCOS after surgery is high in patients with congenital heart disease (CHD). Therefore, determining the risk factors of LCOS has clinical significance for the management of CHD. This study aimed to analyze the risk factors of LCOS. Methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of children with CHD who underwent cardiac surgery at Shanghai Children's Medical Center between January 1, 2014, and December 31, 2017. Demographic characteristics and baseline data were extracted from the health data resource center of the hospital, which integrates clinical routine data including medical records, diagnoses, orders, surgeries, laboratory tests, imaging, nursing, and other subsystems. Logistic regressions were performed to analyze the risk factors of LCOS. Results: Overall, 8660 infants with CHD were included, and 864 (9.98%) had LCOS after surgery. The multivariate regression analysis identified that age (OR 0.992, 95% CI: 0.988-0.997, p = 0.001), tricuspid regurgitation (1.192, 1.072-1.326, p = 0.001), Risk Adjustment in Congenital Heart Surgery-1 risk grade (1.166, 1.011-1.345, p = 0.035), aortic shunt (left-to-right: 1.37, 1.005-1.867, p = 0.046; bi-directional: 1.716, 1.138-2.587, p = 0.01), atrial shunt (left-toright: 1.407, 1.097-1.805, p = 0.007; right-to-left: 3.168, 1.944-5.163, p < 0.001; bi-directional: 1.87, 1.389-2.519, p < 0.001), ventricular level shunt (left-to-right: 0.676, 0.486-0.94, p = 0.02; bi-directional: 2.09, 1.611-2.712, p < 0.001), residual shunt (3.489, 1.502-8.105, p = 0.004), left ventricular outflow tract obstruction (3.934, 1.673-9.254, p = 0.002), right ventricular outflow tract obstruction (3.638, 1.225-10.798, p = 0.02), circulating temperature (mild hypothermia: 1.526, 95% CI: 1.205-1.934, p < 0.001; middle and low temperature: 1.738, 1.236-2.443, p = 0.001), duration of cardiopulmonary bypass (1.009, 1.006-1.012, p < 0.001), myocardial preservation using histidine-tryptophanketoglutarate (1.677, 1.298-2.167, p < 0.001), and mitral insufficiency (1.714, 1.239-2.37, p < 0.001) were independent risk predictors of LCOS. Conclusions: The incidence of postoperative LCOS in CHD children remains high. Circulation temperature, myocardial preservation using histidine-tryptophan-ketoglutarate, and usage of residual shunt after surgery were independent risk predictors for LCOS.",

LCOS is associated with a decreased ejection fraction and decreased oxygen supply, which may cause hypoxia.

The most commonly reported clinical predictors of LCOS include left ventricular ejection fraction < 20%, surgical history, female gender, and increasing age [2, 6, 7] . Prediction models based on clinical data, such as EuroSCORE, have been proposed [8] .

In a secondary retrospective analysis of a prospective randomized trial, Table 1 The clinical characteristics of CHD children (including demographic characteristics, pre-operative color doppler echocardiography characteristics, the characteristic of surgery and cardiopulmonary bypass, and post-operative characteristics) LCOS occurred in 32 of 76 (42%) neonates (median age, 7 days) after cardiac surgery [17] . This difference was attributed to the probable difference in age. Neonatal myocardium is physiologically immature [18] [19] [20] [21] and every procedure affects the incidence of LCOS differently [22] . The age range of children included in this study was larger (1-6457 days), and we included different types of cardiac surgery. This could be the main reason why the LCOS incidence was higher than that in adults and lower than that in newborns. We found that age, aortic shunt (left-to-right and bidirectional), atrial shunt, ventricular level shunt (left-toright and bi-directional), circulation temperature, and myocardial preservation using HTK were independent predictors of LCOS.",

During routine hypothermic CPB, the heart is damaged by hypothermia, ischemiareperfusion, or hyperkalemia, which is associated with an excess risk of postoperative LCOS and severe arrhythmia [24] . Yau et al. found that during hypothermic CPB, the myocardium acquires energy through anaerobic metabolism, leading to the accumulation of lactic acid. After reperfusion, aerobic metabolism cannot be resumed immediately in cardiomyocytes owing to low temperature, but still anaerobic metabolism can occur for a short period. Whereas, patients with mild hypothermia CPB are less affected [25] . The study found that the inflammatory response mediated by CPB caused pulmonary vascular endothelial damage, which changed the pulmonary vascular reactivity. These cause excessive thromboxane production and reduced endogenous nitric oxide production, which can lead to pulmonary vasoconstriction and formation of pulmonary microthrombus. Further, these changes could induce pulmonary vascular resistance, which increases after CPB [26] . Then, the right ventricular afterload increases, which is significantly associated with right ventricular dysfunction and LCOS. Obesity or high BMI is a common factor associated with poor prognosis. A propensity score-matched analysis found that obese (BMI, \u226530 kg/m 2 ) patients who underwent surgery for type A acute aortic dissection had higher postoperative mortality rates. Moreover, a previous report stated that obesity was significantly associated with increased risk of LCOS and other postoperative morbidities [27] . However, in our study, there was no significant correlation between BMI and LCOS risk after cardiac surgery in CHD children. This correlation is different from the results of the abovementioned study on adults and we ascertain that the 'obesity paradox' may explain this inconsistency. The BMI of the CHD children in our study may be lower than that of the general population, and the patients with BMI > P95 percentile did not have such high obesity levels.",

Circulation temperature, myocardial preservation using HTK, and usage of residual shunt after surgery were independent risk predictors for LCOS. Further multi-center studies toned to be conducted with a larger sample size to confirm our study results.",
