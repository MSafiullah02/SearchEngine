We provided workshops and seminars and collaborated with honest experts who helped gain passage of state legislation in Wisconsin outlawing pesticide use against bats (Wisconsin State Assembly Bill 630). We also shared our experience and information widely through BCI members, empowering them to gain similar progress in additional states; exaggerated claims would be rebutted. Using positive photographic portrayal of bats, we provided pro-bat articles to most of America\u2019s leading wildlife magazines and published a layman\u2019s handbook America\u2019s Neighborhood Bats that put risks and benefits in perspective and clearly explained how to solve bat problems or identify honest pest control companies (Tuttle 1988a).",

Periodically, Americans still experience dire warnings about bats, usually by states with the largest, unjustifiable budgets for rabies control. States that have \u201cpassive\u201d rabies prevention programs, wherein people are informed of bite risks, the need for pet vaccinations, and timely reporting of any bites, suffer no more human rabies mortality than states with \u201cactive\u201d programs supported by large budgets for surveillance and prevention. In fact, it is extremely unlikely that stricter guidelines or warnings about bats could further reduce this consistently rare problem (Canada Communicable Disease Report 2009; Tuttle 1999).",

Furthermore, since numerous bat populations have been in steady decline for decades as a result of overhunting, some being driven to extinction up to 100 years ago (Pierson and Rainey 1992; Racey and Entwistle 2003), it is unlikely that humans are at greater risk today than in the past.

Sensational news stories made national headlines. People panicked, and the bats were nearly eradicated. BCI met with leadership individuals in the health department, city government, and local news media, gaining their cooperation to present a balanced educational message, not scaring people, but warning them not to handle bats. As a result, the community has benefitted greatly. The bats consume 15 tons of insects nightly and attract 12 million tourist dollars each summer.

            "text": "Several effective approaches for controlling vampires are now available, but too often nothing is done till after livestock begin to die of rabies making it too late to prevent an outbreak from running its course. Vaccines can provide protection when administered prior to an outbreak, and application of an anticoagulant (often chlorophacinone, diphacinone, or warfarin) mixed with Vaseline, either to wounds where vampires return to feed or to the bodies of vampires captured and released, can be highly effective (Fig. 18.5). Application on bite wounds works best for campesinos with relatively few animals in that it kills only the offending individuals, whereas pasting captured/released vampires works best for larger ranches. Through mutual grooming one pasted bat can kill up to 40 others (Brass 1994; Lord 1988). The latter method should be utilized only by trained teams working in front of advancing rabies outbreaks to create barriers against further spread. Limited studies have indicated negligible impacts on carnivores and scavengers who may eat poisoned vampires, though potential unintended consequences should be monitored (Brass 1994; Burns and Bullard 1979; Lord 1988). As is, most humans can be protected from vampire bits by screening windows or by mosquito nets, backed up by vaccination when bites occur (Lopez et al. 1992; Peters 2004; Schneider et al. 2009). Unfortunately, education on appropriate controls has lagged far behind scientific knowledge (Brass 1994; Lord 1988), even though education to easily identify vampire bats can be highly effective in solving most problems (Brass 1994). BCI recruited two of Latin America\u2019s foremost authorities on vampire control, Rexford Lord of Venezuela and Hugo Sancho of Costa Rica, to produce a 26-min video, titled Control del Murcielago Vampiro y La Rabia Bovina, that covered the best available techniques for controlling problem vampires while also showing the importance of protecting beneficial species (Walker 2002). Many vampire control personnel became collaborators in bat conservation.\n\n",

Unfortunately, they are most frequently killed while rearing young making losses especially impactful.

He initially referred to flying foxes as \u201cblack devils\u201d that could wipe out a crop in just a few nights. However, he later admitted that he and his fellow growers had greatly exaggerated losses and that flying foxes seldom harmed his crops. He had suffered significant losses just three times in 30 years, wherein 80, 50, and 30 % of his crop was lost. Those were years when gum trees, the bats\u2019 preferred local food, had failed to flower. By comparison, he estimated that cute rosella birds (Platycercus eximius), which he liked, were damaging roughly 10 % of his unprotected fruits annually. Averaged over time, these birds cost him nearly twice as much as flying foxes, but when bat problems occurred, they posed greater short-term hardships.",

With this excellent return on investment, he became a netting distributor. A government-commissioned study confirmed Trappel\u2019s basic assessment, both of damage and remedies (Fleming and Robinson 1987), and the government now offers low-interest loans to assist with exclusion netting. Some of the greatest opportunities to further the conservation of bats begin when we genuinely investigate real or perceived nuisance problems, and although many claims are based entirely on misperceptions, these should not be denied without careful investigation.",

I examined thousands of mangos during harvest, interviewed growers, and conducted controlled experiments of fruit ripeness preferences of bats. Although many mangos were eaten nightly in orchards, none of them were commercially harvestable nor would captive bats of six species consume harvestable fruit even when deprived of other food (Fig. 18.11). Akberkhan Khan, the largest mango exporter in Kenya at the time, explained that mangos ripe enough to attract bats are too ripe for harvest, and by removing those mangos, bats reduce breeding opportunities for fruit fly and fungal pests. Some growers often mistook bush baby and monkey tooth marks in harvestable fruit for bats. In Malaysia and Indonesia, growers of rambutan (Nephelium lappaceum), langsat (Lansium domesticum), and water chestnut (Eugenia aquea) reported that bats threatened crops only for the last few nights prior to harvest and that most problems could be avoided by using bright lights or fires (Fujita and Tuttle 1991).\n\n",

Land managers should be informed regarding the potential threat of cats at bat roosts, especially in front of protective gates that if built in narrow cave entrances force bats to slow and circle, an invitation to unnatural predation.

Numbers again plummeted when he partially obstructed airflow through the main entrance resulting in only 65 remaining gray bats in 1974. However, after the obstruction was removed, the hibernation area temperature dropped by an average of 2\u00b0C, and the population steadily grew to exceed 150,000 by 2010 (Samoray 2010).

Due to its popularity with bat watchers, a new roost that can accommodate 400,000 was built in 2010. The combined colony size is already 300,000 and growing rapidly (Reed 2012). More free-tailed bats now live in these two artificial roosts than are known from all the natural roosts in Florida combined, illustrating that loss of roosts is the key bottleneck to restoring bat populations of that area.",

They can lose up to 50 % of their body mass in water in a single day (O\u2019Farrell et al. 1971), likely explaining why most nursery colonies are located near reliable water resources. Also, unlike other animals, most bats must drink in flight, typically requiring an unobstructed swoop zone of at least 3 m, some as much as 30 m (Fig. 18.14) (Taylor and Tuttle 2007). The availability of surface water and associated riparian habitat has declined alarmingly over the past 150 years (Adams 2003), and special watering devices for other animals often fail to meet bat needs.\n\n",
