In February 2003, a Chinese doctor stayed in a hotel in Hong Kong and infected seven guests who subsequently transmitted the disease to Canada, Singapore, and the United States [2]. Different hypotheses have been suggested for its mode of transmissions including aerosol dispersion [3], environmental contamination[4], and inter-species transmission [5], [6]. Nosocomial transmission was an early-noted feature of the disease with about 20% of the cases in the world belonging to this category [1]. In September 2003, one new SARS case was reported in Singapore [7] and from December 16, 2003 through April 30, 2004, another 14 new SARS cases were reported in four areas in China (Taiwan, Guangdong, Beijing, and Anhui) [8], [9], [10]. It is still uncertain whether there will be any resurgence of SARS in other parts of the world.",

SARS was perceived to be severe as 84% of the general population believed that the epidemic was out of control and 51.6% believed that it was fatal [12]. Relevant norms had been formed in that people now believe that mask use signifies civic responsibility [12]. Over 90% of the general public believed that the use of face-masks, frequent hand-washing, and disinfection of living quarters to be efficacious means of SARS prevention. This study also showed that about 34% of the respondents worried that they themselves or their family members might contract SARS. Therefore, it is not surprising to observe an increase in the use of SARS-related preventive behaviors (such as mask use, hand hygiene, and disinfection of living quarters, etc.) when the post-SARS period and the pre-SARS periods were compared. It is, however, interesting to see that such behavioral changes have been sustained for an intermediate period of time (3 months). It is also very interesting to note that changes of health-seeking behaviors have spilled over to other areas that are less directly related to SARS, such as adherence to healthier life styles, compliance to medical advices, and avoidance of risk behaviors, etc. The behavioral changes may be indicative of fundamental changes in health-seeking behaviors.",

Fear toward HIV was also associated with condom use [27]. About 73% of the general public in Hong Kong considered SARS to be \u201chorrible\u201d (Lau et al.: unpublished data). Therefore, the findings that those who worried about contracting SARS (themselves or their family members) were more likely to practice health-seeking behaviors are very much in line with the findings reported in the international literature. However, fear may also result in discrimination. The HIV/AIDS campaign therefore had avoided using the \u201cfear approach\u201d (e.g., the \u201cdeath pyramid\u201d symbol). A balance between the need for prevention and avoidance of possible discrimination is hence required.",

A number of studies have also been published using telephone surveys [12], [29], [30]. The age and gender distributions of the sample are more or less comparable to those obtained from the census data [31]. Second, the response rate was about 55% and information of non-respondents could not be obtained. The response rate was comparable to many other studies in Hong Kong [12], [29]. Thirdly, the responses may be subjected to social desirability bias. However, the study is anonymous and there was some variation in the responses to different questions. For instance, only 10% said that they were exercising more often during the SARS period and only 13.5% said that they were more likely than before to avoid practicing risk behaviors. Fourth, baseline data had not been obtained in the pre-SARS period. The percentages of respondents self-reporting an improvement when self-reported deterioration however showed strong contrasts.",
