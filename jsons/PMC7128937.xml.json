A repeat dengue rapid test was positive for dengue IgM and IgG (Dengue Combo; Wells Bio, South Korea). He was referred to hospital for dengue with worsening cough and dyspnoea. A chest radiograph led to testing for SARS-CoV-2 by RT-PCR (in-house laboratory-developed test detecting the N and ORF1ab genes) from a nasopharyngeal swab, which returned positive. The original seropositive sample and additional urine and blood samples tested negative for dengue, chikungunya, and Zika viruses by RT-PCR,3, 4, 5 and a repeat dengue rapid test (SD Bioline) was also negative. Thus, the initial dengue seroconversion result was deemed a false positive.",
