For many such febrile illnesses, it is difficult to pin-point an aetiology based on history and clinical examination alone because of a non-specific presentation, apart from a documented or undocumented rise of temperature, and lack of a localizing physical sign. In the absence of reliable point-of-care diagnostic tests to differentiate the aetiology in resource poor settings, \u2018fever\u2019 itself is established as a diagnosis rather than a symptom and treated empirically with antimicrobials [2]. Such acute \u2018undifferentiated\u2019 febrile illnesses (AUFI) are often attributed to self-limiting viral infections in the industrialized countries, but in the developing world, they are more commonly caused by malaria, dengue, enteric fever, rickettsial illness, leptospira and other agents [3].",

However, outbreaks of more severe form of viral infection like pandemic influenza A have been reported [5, 6]. Enteric fever remains endemic in Kathmandu and has a potential for large outbreaks due to high population density, water contamination, and inadequate hygiene and sanitation [7]. Outbreaks of significant magnitude have been reported from elsewhere in Nepal in the past [8, 9]. Rickettsial infections, both murine typhus and scrub typhus have been reported as common causes of AUFI in Nepal [10, 11]. A large outbreak of scrub typhus from mid-western region of Nepal has been reported after the major earthquake of 2015 [12]. Due to a lower reported prevalence of rickettsial illnesses, a clinical presentation resembling enteric fever and a lack of a reliable point-of-care diagnostic test, these illnesses are also presumed and treated as enteric fever [13].",

In the absence of robust epidemiological data and reliable point-of-care diagnostics, a large number of patients in the outbreaks of AUFI in enteric fever endemic settings such as Kathmandu, Nepal are empirically diagnosed and treated as enteric fever [18, 19]. It is a common practice to initiate antimicrobials with minimal effort to establish a specific diagnosis [15]. This can lead to prolonged fever clearance time, treatment failures, and antimicrobial resistance. Laboratory tests to differentiate these infections are not available outside hospital setting and available rapid tests for non-malarial causes of fever are largely insufficient [20, 21]. The detailed characterization of the illness at presentation and clinical course can suggest appropriate diagnosis and help formulate recommendations for treatment and control efforts [16, 22].",

WHO has formulated the guidelines for the management of common illnesses in resource poor settings for children, and adolescent and adults [23, 24]. The development of protocols for the investigations and management of AUFIs in hospital settings of South Asia have been attempted [25]. However these protocols are insufficient to approach the diagnosis and management of febrile illness within outbreaks in developing countries where large number of cases is treated outside healthcare facilities without clinical expertise and reliable diagnostic tests at the point-of-care [21]. An epidemiological approach to an outbreak and protocol for the diagnosis and treatment is critical for the management of patients and stopping disease transmission. Owing to large heterogeneity in the etiologies over time and space, geographically explicit protocols taking into account of seasonality would improve the treatment outcomes and accelerate control efforts [21, 26]. A routine real-time reporting of surveillance data with advanced computational methods for the epidemiological analysis will help to rapidly identify an outbreak and the factors associated with it.",
