            "text": "Despite significant advances in our understanding of microorganisms and the pathogenesis of inflammation and infection, infection remains a major cause of patient morbidity and mortality. Although signs and symptoms such as fever, pain, general malaise and abnormal laboratory results may suggest the presence of infection, the diagnosis can be elusive and imaging tests often are used for confirmation and localization. There are two principal categories of imaging tests: anatomical or morphological, and molecular. Anatomical imaging tests, such as radiographs, ultrasound and computed tomography (CT) reveal structural alterations in tissues and organs caused by microbial invasion and the inflammatory response of the host. Prototypical molecular imaging tests use agents such as gallium-68 citrate, labeled leukocytes and fluorine-18 fluorodeoxyglucose ([18F]FDG). These agents, which reflect the physiological changes that are part of the inflammatory process, are taken up directly by cells, tissues and organs, or are attached to native substances that subsequently migrate to an inflammatory focus. Because they provide different types of information, anatomical and molecular imaging studies are complementary to each another. There are certain situations, however, in which molecular imaging tests are especially valuable: postoperative infections and infections associated with orthopedic hardware, notably prosthetic joint infection. Postoperative infections are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. Ultrasound, CT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) cannot consistently separate abscesses from other fluid collections and, on occasion, even from normal postoperative changes. The distorted anatomy, metallic sutures and the surgical incision itself further complicate study interpretation. Molecular imaging studies, however, demonstrate physiological processes, which often precede anatomical changes, and can help distinguish normal postoperative inflammation from infection. In suspected orthopedic hardware infection, plain radiographs are neither sensitive nor specific and cross-sectional imaging modalities, such as CT and MRI, are limited by hardware-induced artifacts. Radionuclide imaging is not affected by metallic hardware and is the current imaging modality of choice for diagnosing orthopedic hardware infection.",

Increased blood flow and vascular membrane permeability result in increased 67Ga delivery and accumulation at the inflammatory foci. 67Ga also binds to lactoferrin, which is present in high concentrations in inflammatory foci. Direct bacterial uptake, complexing with siderophores and leukocyte transport also contribute to 67Ga uptake in inflammation and infection. Imaging usually is performed 18\u201372 h after injection.

Uptake depends on intact chemotaxis, number and types of cells labeled and cellular response in a particular condition. A circulating WBC count of at least 2,000/\u03bcL is needed for satisfactory images. Although a mixed population of WBCs is labeled, the majority of WBCs labeled are usually neutrophils and the procedure is most sensitive for identifying neutrophil-mediated infectious processes [2]. It is possible to selectively label granulocytes. To do so, however, requires the use of a gradient separation process, further lengthening an already labor-intensive process. Published results, in general, have shown no real advantage of radiolabeled granulocytes over radiolabeled leukocytes for routine clinical use [3].",

The reason for this is that WBCs accumulate not only in sites of infection, but also in the bone marrow. The normal distribution of hematopoietically active bone marrow in adults is variable. Systemic diseases such as sickle cell and Gaucher disease produce generalized alterations in marrow distribution; fractures, orthopedic hardware and neuropathic joints cause localized alterations. The normal distribution of hematopoietically active marrow in children varies with age. Consequently, it may not be possible to determine whether an area of activity on a WBC image represents infection or marrow. Performing 99mTc-colloid bone marrow imaging overcomes this problem. Both WBCs and colloid accumulate in marrow; WBCs also accumulate in infection, but colloid does not. The combined study is positive for infection when activity is present on the WBC image without corresponding activity on the marrow image. Any other pattern is negative for infection. The combined study has been most extensively investigated in prosthetic joint infections, but is valuable in any condition that affects marrow distribution, showing an overall accuracy of approximately 90 % [18] (Fig. 3).\n",

Decay-corrected images avoid operator bias and the fact of using the same count scale in all images facilitates image interpretation. Increasing uptake, either in size or over time, is considered positive for infection; lack of uptake or decreasing uptake over time is classified as negative for infection. Dual time point imaging with decay-corrected acquisition times may decrease the need for complementary bone marrow imaging, thereby reducing costs as well as radiation exposure to both patients and personnel [19].",

Transport of [18F]FDG across the cell membrane is mediated by glucose transporter proteins (GLUT). Intracellular [18F]FDG is phosphorylated by the enzyme hexokinase and trapped in the cell. With the exception of a few organs, physiological uptake of [18F]FDG is low and clearance from non-target tissue is rapid, resulting in relatively high target-to-background ratios. With the new hybrid PET/CT systems, diagnostic evaluation can be completed in a single visit in just 1\u20132 h (including the waiting time, after injection, necessary for sufficient tracer uptake). Compared with many other radiopharmaceuticals, [18F]FDG has a very favorable dosimetry. It is very sensitive and in most situations has a high negative predictive value. There are, however, limitations to this agent, notably its specificity. [18F]FDG PET merely detects enhanced glucose metabolism and is therefore unable to discriminate reliably between infection/inflammation, malignancy and any other hypermetabolic state. [18F]FDG also cannot distinguish between different inflammatory pathways, which can be relevant in some clinical situations [31].",

FIAU, because of the homology between viral and bacterial TK, is also a specific substrate of bacterial TK [67]. Localized infections caused by five genera of bacteria have been imaged successfully with 125I-FIAU [68]. Data also suggest that this tracer can be used to monitor the efficacy of antimicrobial therapy, because in a preclinical model of lung infection 125I-FIAU signal intensity was proportional to the bacterial load. It was suggested that imaging with FIAU could potentially be used to evaluate the efficacy of newly developed antibiotics [69]. The feasibility of using 124I-FIAU for diagnosing infection in humans was demonstrated in an investigation of nine subjects, including eight with suspected musculoskeletal infection and one healthy control. All patients with proven musculoskeletal infections demonstrated 124I-FIAU accumulation at the site of infection by 2 h after injection. There was no abnormal tracer uptake in the one control and there were no adverse reactions among any of the subjects [70]. The role of 124I-FIAU as a diagnostic imaging agent for diagnosing prosthetic joint infection is under investigation.",
