            "text": "Coronaviruses are members of the family Coronaviridae, which includes two genera, coronaviruses and toroviruses. Coronaviruses are single-stranded, positive-sense RNA viruses with a genome of approximately 30 kD, the largest genome among RNA viruses. These viruses were named coronaviruses because by electron microscopy they have club-shaped surface projections that give them a crownlike appearance. The genome encodes four or five structural proteins (a spike protein [S], a small envelope protein [E], a membrane protein [M], a nucleocapsid protein [N], and sometimes a hemagglutinin-esterase protein [HE]), a varying number of open reading frames scattered among the structural genes, and a polyprotein that is processed into multiple (usually 16) nonstructural proteins. These nonstructural proteins participate in virus replication but are not incorporated into the virion. Coronaviruses have also been isolated from a variety of animals and birds and, in their respective species, cause a wide range of respiratory, gastrointestinal, neurologic, and systemic illnesses. The coronaviruses have traditionally been divided into three antigenic groups; human and animal viruses compose groups I and II and avian viruses group III. The first two human coronaviruses, 229E and OC43, are members of groups I and II, respectively. SARS coronavirus is a distant member of group II, and the two most recent human coronavirus isolates, NL63 and HK1, are members of groups I and II, respectively. Detection of novel coronaviruses in bats has greatly expanded our understanding of diversity among coronaviruses and suggests that additional groups may be needed to classify these viruses.",

            "text": "The coronaviruses, which are common pathogens of humans, appear to be transmitted through close contact that probably includes contamination of hands from person-to-person contact or from fomites, followed by autoinoculation to the mucosal surfaces of the mouth, nose, or eyes or inhalation of infectious droplets and possibly aerosols. Symptoms occur 2 to 4 days after infection. The non-SARS coronaviruses are detected in patients with acute respiratory illnesses, most often a mild, upper respiratory tract illness (i.e., the common cold), but also in patients with more serious respiratory illnesses including pneumonia, bronchiolitis, and croup. Coronavirus infections are detected early in childhood, and repeated infections can occur throughout life. About 50% of children have antibodies against OC43 by 3 years of age, and about 70% of adults have such antibodies. Up to 75% of children have antibodies against NL63 and 229E by 3.5 years of age. Studies looking for 229E- and OC43-like infections suggest that coronaviruses are associated with about 15% of cases of the common cold and with up to 10% of cases of acute respiratory illnesses in children and adults. Individually, 229E, OC43, HKU1, and NL63 are detected in less than 1% to 4% of cases, and their individual contributions will vary by location and year. Serious illness has been reported in outbreaks among elderly patients in nursing homes. In one outbreak associated with OC43 infection, for example, 23 residents and 24 staff reported influenza-like illness, and three residents died. The non-SARS coronaviruses can be detected throughout the year, but peak detection is often during fall and winter months in temperate climates. A second respiratory viral pathogen can be detected in 20 to 60% of specimens positive for a non-SARS coronavirus.",

            "text": "Most documented SARS coronavirus infections in humans occurred in persons ill with a SARS-like illness during the 2002-2003 global outbreak. It is likely that wild animal markets in Guangdong Province, China, played a key role in amplifying and introducing the virus into humans, but the original source of the outbreak virus has not been determined. Detection of multiple SARS-like and other coronaviruses in bats suggests that they are a rich source of coronaviruses and likely the source of SARS coronavirus. The parent to the outbreak virus has, however, not yet been detected. Although animals were the original source of human infections, global spread of SARS coronavirus occurred through human-to-human transmission and involved droplet, person-to-person, and fomite transmission and, in some instances, probably small-particle aerosol transmission. Most transmission occurred within households, hospitals, or other health care facilities, and little transmission occurred in the community. The fact that most transmission occurred after the patient's illness had become serious and required hospitalization helps explain the importance of transmission in health care settings and the relative lack of transmission in the community.",

            "text": "The human coronaviruses characterized to date, including SARS coronavirus, infect humans through the respiratory tract. The site of virus replication is determined, at least in part, by which cells express the respective receptors. The receptors for antigenic group I human coronaviruses 229E and the recently described NL63 are aminopeptidase N and angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), respectively. The receptors for the two group II human coronaviruses characterized to date, OC43 and the recently described HK1, have not yet been determined, but OC43 may use several cell surface molecules as receptors, including 9-O-acetylated neuraminic acid. The primary receptor for SARS coronavirus is ACE2, but the virus also binds to two C-type lectins expressed on dendritic cells, DC-SIGN and L-SIGN. Aminopeptidase N is expressed in various cells, including respiratory, gastrointestinal, kidney epithelial, and myeloid cells, but 229E is known to infect only respiratory epithelial cells. ACE2 is found in various tissues, including the lung, gastrointestinal tract, heart, and kidneys. The SARS coronavirus has consistently been detected in pneumocytes in the lung and enterocytes in the gastrointestinal tract, and it is occasionally found in other cells, including distal tubular cells in the kidney and macrophages in various tissues. Autopsy studies suggest that infection in the lung leads initially to diffuse alveolar damage and later may lead to a repair process that includes fibrosis in the alveolar walls. It is not known whether NL63, which also uses ACE2 as its receptor, infects sites other than the respiratory tract.",

How this interplay contributes to disease, however, is not understood. The biphasic course of SARS in some patients, with the onset of severe disease in the second week of illness, and the decrease in the number of lymphocytes suggest a role for the host response and virus-induced immune suppression in the disease process.",

The best studied of the non-SARS coronaviruses, human coronaviruses 229E and OC43, cause respiratory symptoms, such as rhinorrhea, nasal congestion, sore throat, and cough, as well as systemic symptoms, including fever, headache, and malaise, when they are inoculated intranasally in adult volunteers. Symptoms develop 2 to 4 days after inoculation, but about 30% of the volunteers who excrete virus had no associated illness. Symptoms usually persist for about 1 week but sometimes for as long as 3 weeks. Previous infection does not induce high levels of protective immunity. Humans can be reinfected with respiratory coronaviruses throughout life, and human volunteers can be symptomatically reinfected with the same strain of coronavirus 1 year after the first infection. As with other infections, the severity of disease varies among individual patients during the same outbreak and among groups of patients during different outbreaks in the same community. Patients with compromised cardiac, pulmonary, or immune systems are at increased risk of more serious lower respiratory tract illness, and outbreaks of human coronavirus infections in elderly patients in chronic care facilities can cause severe lower respiratory illnesses and deaths.",

            "text": "In contrast to the mild illness associated with 229E and OC43, SARS coronavirus infection nearly always results in a serious illness that requires hospitalization, often in an intensive care unit, and a high fatality rate. Radiologic evidence of pneumonia was seen in nearly all SARS coronavirus\u2013infected persons, and acute respiratory distress syndrome (Chapter 104) requiring admission to an intensive care unit and mechanical ventilation developed in 20% or more of patients. Nearly 10% of outbreak-associated patients died. The death rate was especially high, approaching 50%, in elderly patients and patients with underlying illnesses. The initial clinical manifestation of SARS was often systemic symptoms of fever, malaise, and myalgias from 2 to 10 days (rarely longer than 10 days) after exposure. Several days after the onset of systemic symptoms, lower respiratory tract symptoms of nonproductive cough and shortness of breath were noted. Unlike patients with other respiratory virus infections, the majority of patients never experience upper respiratory tract symptoms such as rhinorrhea, sore throat, or nasal congestion (Table 374-1\n). As with other infections, the expected signs and symptoms with SARS coronavirus infection may be obscured or not present in elderly patients or patients with underlying chronic illnesses. During the course of their illness, most SARS coronavirus\u2013infected patients had elevated liver enzyme levels and lymphopenia, including a substantial drop in numbers of both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. SARS coronavirus\u2013infected patients with severe complications also often suffered complications associated with intensive supportive care, such as secondary bacterial infections. A more severe illness with infection has been associated with older age, underlying chronic illness, higher liver enzyme values, lower lymphocyte levels and platelet counts, and higher titers of virus or viral RNA. Asymptomatic or mild illness occurred but was uncommon. In studies of exposed health care workers and patients who did not have a SARS-like illness, less than 1% of those tested had definitive serologic evidence of SARS coronavirus infection (i.e., a positive neutralization test result). In general, children had less severe illness than adults did.",

Most coronavirus PCR assays are type specific, that is, specific to SARS coronavirus, 229E, OC43, HKU1, or NL63 RNA. Coronavirus diagnostic assays have not been generally available and may have to be obtained by special requests from a limited number of sites that perform human coronavirus diagnostics. Presence of the virus can also be inferred by electron microscopy and confirmed by in situ or immunohistologic assays of affected tissues. Positive immunohistologic and in situ hybridization studies document the site of infection and help support a link between the virus and the disease process. A variety of enzyme or fluorescent immunoassays for antibodies have been used successfully to detect infection. Most assays detect IgG antibodies, but virus neutralization antibody assays are more specific. The need to detect a diagnostic rise in antibodies between acute and convalescent serum specimens for non-SARS coronavirus infections means that serologic tests are not helpful for managing the acute care of individual patients, although they are very helpful for epidemiologic studies.",

First, SARS has occurred only in persons who have some potential exposure, that is, to patients with SARS, to a location with SARS transmission, to a laboratory working on SARS coronavirus, or to a setting where SARS-infected animals might be located (e.g., southern China). Second, nearly 100% of infected patients develop chest radiographic abnormalities by day 10 of their illness. Finally, SARS nearly always developed within 10 days of exposure. Thus, a suspicion of SARS and a diagnostic evaluation can be limited to patients who have a severe lower respiratory tract illness and some potential exposure to SARS within 10 days before the onset of illness.",

            "text": "Laboratory confirmation of SARS coronavirus infection early in the illness proved to be problematic, even with sensitive real-time PCR assays. Unlike in most respiratory viral infections, the highest titer of virus, or viral RNA, was found in clinical specimens from the second week of illness. During the first week of illness, the best way to detect infection is by a sensitive PCR assay or a sensitive enzyme immunoassay for N protein antigen applied to respiratory and serum specimens. During the second week of illness, respiratory and stool specimens are most likely to be positive for viral RNA. Because most populations are negative for SARS coronavirus antibodies, detection of serum SARS coronavirus antibodies is a reliable indicator of infection. Antibodies were sometimes detected early in the second week of illness but at times were not detected until 4 weeks into the illness. Because antibodies persist in serum, a specimen can be collected late without compromising the ability to detect antibodies. Serologic assays, unlike PCR assays, are not confounded by problems with specimen contamination. Because antibodies to SARS coronavirus were rarely present before the 2003 outbreak, a single positive antibody test result from an ill person could be considered diagnostic of an acute SARS coronavirus infection. However, because the reemergence of SARS coronavirus will have substantial public health, social, and economic impact, and because of occasional cross-reacting antibodies induced by other coronaviruses, a neutralization antibody test and repeated testing by a reference laboratory are required to confirm the diagnosis.Treatment There is no virus-specific treatment of non-SARS coronavirus infections, but the illnesses are mild and usually resolve in a few days to a week. Patients require symptomatic therapy or, uncommonly, management of complications of infection.Treatment of SARS coronavirus infection is more complex. Currently, no antiviral drug has proved to be effective. With the high death rate, fast pace of the outbreak, and no clinical or in vitro data to guide treatment, a combination of ribavirin, steroids, and various mechanical ventilation and oxygenation regimens was often used to treat SARS patients. Later in the outbreak, in vitro data showed little if any antiviral effect with ribavirin and suggested that interferon alfa, SARS convalescent phase immune globulin, and lopinavir plus ritonavir might be useful. Although many people were treated during the outbreak, lack of control groups makes it impossible to determine which if any therapies were beneficial. If SARS reemerges, it is hoped that in vitro and animal studies can provide clearer guidance for treatment.\n",
