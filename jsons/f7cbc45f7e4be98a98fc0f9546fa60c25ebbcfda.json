This research area has been developing very rapidly since the early 1990s, and it is very likely that the number of studies on this topic will continue to grow in the next decades. Detection of DNA/RNA of pathogenic bacteria and viruses could be essential for choosing an appropriate treatment strategy. Recent studies have dis covered the correlation between the risk of developing certain diseases in humans and single nucleotide poly morphisms or short insertions/deletions. It was also found that human microRNA genes are often located in the vicinity of genome regions and sites associated with cancer. The expression levels of some microRNAs in patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, colorectal neoplasia, Burkitt lymphoma, lung cancer, large cell lymphomas, glioblastoma, and other diseases differ from the levels in normal tissues.",

            "text": "Identification of nucleic acids in biological samples and directly in live organisms without prior purification is a very important task. These methods are based on hybridization, which accounts for their high selectivity. Considering that the concentration of nucleic acids in the investigated samples is often very low and its changes in various pathologies could be small, such identification methods should be highly sensitive and have low detec tion limits. To satisfy these requirements, current meth ods of DNA/RNA analysis are often used in combination with different variants of polymerase chain reaction (PCR). PCR is commonly used in practice because of its high efficiency, as it allows to synthesize up to 10 9 copies (amplicons) of the analyzed sequence. However, it has a number of drawbacks, e.g., possible non specific hybridization resulting in the accumulation of undesired products. PCR with real time product detection (quantitative PCR, qPCR) is commonly used for nucleic acid quantifi cation [3] . The two main qPCR variants use (i) Taq DNA polymerase and linear probe (TaqMan technology) or (ii) intercalating dyes (SYBR Green, Eva Green, BOXTO, etc.), as the fluorescence of these dyes dramati cally increases upon their binding to the double stranded DNA. The linear range of qPCR is 10 to 5\u00b710 9 copies of the analyzed sequence [4] ; the sensitivity of this method varies significantly and depends on the structure of used primers. qPCR is also characterized with high repro ducibility.",

Figure 1a shows the principle of the loop mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) technique. This method was first described by Notomi et al. in 2000 [6] . Several primers (more often, four, but sometimes, six) comple mentary to different regions of the analyzed DNA are used together with DNA polymerases with pronounced strand displacement activity. LAMP is conducted at 60\u00b0C. LAMP is initiated by hybridization of the forward inner primer with the complementary 5\u2032 terminal frag ment of the analyte DNA followed by its elongation by DNA polymerase. In the next step, forward outer primer hybridizes with the 5\u2032 end fragment of the analyte and elongated by DNA polymerase with the synthesis of a new strand displacing the earlier synthesized sequence. After this, backward inner primer interacts with the compli mentary fragment in the vicinity of the 3\u2032 end of the newly synthesized sequence. After elongation of this primer, backward outer primer hybridizes with the synthesized DNA sequence. Elongation of this primer leads to the dis placement of the earlier synthesized sequence. The ends of both synthesized sequences form the loops due to the complementary interactions. As a result, two structures with loops at the ends are synthesized, which initiates fur ther amplification cycle with the same primers [7] .",

This tech nique uses helicase, DNA polymerase, and proteins bind ing single stranded DNA. In the first step of the amplifi cation cycle, helicase molecules attach to both ends of the double stranded DNA, which results in the duplex disso ciation. The forward and reverse primers hybridize with the single stranded DNA released from the duplex and stabilized with the DNA binding proteins. This is fol lowed by primer elongation by DNA polymerase. In the end of the first HDA cycle, two DNA molecules are formed. This process is repeated multiple times to increase the analyte concentration. HDA has the expo nential kinetics and can produce up to 10 7 copies of the analyte [27] . HDA is carried out either at 37\u00b0C or within the temperature of 60 to 65\u00b0C. At the lower temperature, the mismatch repair protein MutL is used, while amplifi cation at higher temperatures does not require the pres ence of this protein. Decreasing the amplification tem perature results in higher amount of non specific ampli fication products, which can cause generation of false positives [28] .",

The principle of SDA is shown in Fig. 1e . In the first step, double stranded DNA is denatured at 95\u00b0C (all further SDA steps are conducted at 37\u00b0C), which allows primers to anneal to both daughter strands. The 5\u2032 ends of the primers contain nickase recognition site and do not inter act with the DNA analyte. Klenow fragment (lacking the exonuclease activity) catalyzes elongation of the DNA sequence from the 3\u2032 ends resulting in the formation of duplexes with the nickase recognition sites. Enzymatic hydrolysis with nickase leads to the generation of new 3\u2032 end sequences, which initiates polymerization reaction with simultaneous displacement of the daughter strand of the analyzed chain. This process is repeated multiple times and results in the exponential accumulation of the analyzed sequence. In the case when only one primer is used, amplification has a linear character. The efficiency of SDA is up to 10 7 analyte copies [27] .",

The exis tence of this side activity was also mentioned by other authors [80, 81] . Moreover, we demonstrated that exonu clease III was able to hydrolyze DNA molecules with the G quadruplex structure (unpublished data). Other exonucleases also catalyze such side reactions. This fact significantly limits further development of amplification techniques using these enzymes.",

These structures are formed from two partially com plementary probes (usually 4 6 bp) that do not form duplexes because of only partial complementarity. At the same time, they can form stable Y shaped complexes in the presence of analyzed sequence that is partially com plementary to both probes (Fig. 4a) . Such complexes also contain a restriction endonuclease site. Addition of the respective endonuclease to the reaction mixture results in the enzymatic cleavage of the duplex with the following dissociation of the Y shaped structure and release of the analyzed sequence, which is used for the formation of a new Y shaped complex. The formed Y shaped structure participates in the next amplification cycle, eventually leading to the formation of multiple fragments of the hydrolyzed probes. The availability of a large number of restriction endonucleases (~3500) facilitates the design of various Y shaped probes with different restriction endonuclease sites. Sintim et al. [85] demonstrated that the probe architecture significantly affects the rate of enzymatic hydrolysis of the Y shaped probes, which should be considered in their design. Nickases have been successfully used by some researchers instead of restric tion endonucleases for the hydrolysis of Y junction probes [86] . The amplification reaction in this method is conducted at 25 37\u00b0C.",

The hairpins were incapable of hybridization in the absence of the analyte. Next, the Y junction was formed upon addition of the third biotin labeled hairpin that replaced the analyte molecule in the complex.

This method was devel oped by Dirks and Pierce in 2004 [100] . HCR is based on the formation of a double stranded DNA as a result of interaction between two hairpin sequences, which is initi ated by the addition of DNA/RNA analyte (Fig. 7) . The structures of hairpins 1 and 2 are designed in such a way that the complementary interactions between them are kinetically obstructed. The duplex formation between hairpin 1 and analyzed sequence results in the exposure of the hairpin 1 stem, which is not participating in the duplex formation, which allows this single stranded fragment to interact with hairpin 2. This leads to the duplex formation between the two hairpins and simultaneous exposure of the uninvolved stem of hairpin 2, which interacts with anoth er hairpin 1 molecule. Introduction of labels in the hairpin structure or dyes that can intercalate into the duplex makes it possible to monitor the formed DNA. Therefore, HCR produces double stranded DNA with nicks in each chain, and the length of this molecule is determined by the amount of hairpin structures in the reaction mixture. Usually, HCR is carried out at 25 or 37\u00b0C.",

The rea sons for such discrepancies must be identified in the near est future. It should be mentioned that many of the described methods with low detection limits have low sensitivity, which prevents their use for the determination of analytes, whose concentration differs only slightly in norm and pathology (e.g., miR 21 microRNA) [120] . The publications on the use of analytical amplification techniques for quantification of biomarkers in biological samples are scarce; in most studies, model analytes in buffer solutions were analyzed. All of the above indicates the need for continuing research on the applicability and improvement of bioanalytical techniques based on isothermal amplification, as well as development for practical applications of highly sensitive, accurate, and selective assays on their basis.
