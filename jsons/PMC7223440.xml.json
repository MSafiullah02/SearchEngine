            "text": "The annual incidence of patients with acute brain lesions (0.44%) constitutes an alarming public health concern worldwide [1\u20134]. This high incidence is caused by hypoxic\u2013ischemic brain injury following cardiac arrest as well as severe traumatic brain injury, hemispheric stroke, and high-grade subarachnoid hemorrhage. Primary brain lesions occur during the initial insult and can be aggravated for up to 8 weeks [5, 6]. Secondary brain lesions [7, 8] may occur gradually over subsequent days and worsen primary lesions, imposing a devastating burden on families and societies. Neuroprotective therapies have been implemented with the intention to stabilize primary lesions, prevent or reduce secondary lesions, and improve neurological outcomes and survival rates [9, 10]. Hypothermia is one of the most promising and effective neuroprotective methods, mainly because it reduces cellular metabolic activity [11\u201313]; however, other mechanisms [14\u201317] also contribute to the observed benefits. Therapeutic hypothermia and targeted temperature management have been recommended by the American Heart Association [18\u201320] and The Cochrane Collaboration [21] for preserving cerebral function of patients surviving resuscitation after cardiac arrest. The indication for therapeutic hypothermia in patients with traumatic brain injury is still controversial, but recent meta-analyses have suggested that this method is beneficial [22, 23].",

Therefore, more selective methods have been developed and tested with the aim of reducing adverse events while delivering neuroprotection, with fewer risks to patients [5, 21]. Among the methods with preferential action on brain tissue, nasopharyngeal approaches are the safest and most effective currently under study [27\u201332]. Their anatomical positioning facilitates heat exchange with cervical blood vessels and cerebrospinal fluid flow directed to the brain. Furthermore, conduction of heat through the skull base bones is also effective. Perfluorocarbon gas [27, 29, 30], oxygen [31], and compressed air [32\u201335] administration into the nasopharyngeal cavities is able to cool the brain, but these methods do not allow precise control of temperature, and safety issues remain [36]. Methods utilizing circulating water are the most promising approaches due to their superior safety profile and ability to exchange heat with nasopharyngeal surfaces effectively [37]. However, no nasopharyngeal method has yet proven whether brain cooling without systemic temperature reduction is possible and assessed whether this approach could reduce the systemic consequences of core temperature reduction and its related adverse events.",

A relevant mean decrease in core temperature of up to 2.5 \u00b0C was observed [27] in animals and did not prevent systemic or cardiovascular complications [48]. Preliminary human studies with a gas-based method reported local adverse events [30]. Our study demonstrated that a water-based method was effective and safe while local and systemic adverse events were prevented during this experiment. Brain temperature was significantly decreased in both hemispheres which may be desired in global neurological lesions such as global ischemia following cardiac arrest. Nonetheless, brain temperature was preferentially reduced in the left side because catheters were only introduced in the left nostril. This effect may facilitate the decision to prioritize one side to be cooled in localized neurological conditions like stroke. Counter-warming with blankets and thermal mattresses was applied with the intention to prevent a core temperature reduction while cooling the nasopharyngeal surface. For this study, we considered the normal core body temperature of pigs as 38\u201340 \u00b0C [49, 50]. Whole-body cooling is the current method for therapeutic cooling and target temperature management [18, 21, 51] and plays an important role in fever control. Selective methods, such as the method described in the present study, may change this trend in the near future due to their effectiveness and favorable short-term safety profile.",

During the cooling phase, there was a significant decrease in PbtO2, which returned to baseline levels during the rewarming phase. The changes in PbtO2 were proportional to those in brain temperature. Since PbtO2 probes measure oxygen levels at the cellular level, this result was expected in healthy individuals because the coupling between oxygen demand and delivery remains preserved, and the oxygen demand of brain cells is physiologically reduced under lower temperatures. A leftward shift of the oxyhemoglobin dissociation curve [55, 56] during temperature reduction may also explain the decreased oxygen levels observed in this situation. In both cases, oxygen delivery is preserved and prevents harm. It is important to mention that we used healthy pigs in our study where autoregulation and physiological functions are preserved. In experimental or clinical studies with brain lesions, this pattern may be affected by loss of autoregulation, and comparisons to our data should be made with caution. The high levels of oxygen in brain tissue at baseline are defined by 100% FiO2 level. We decided to maintain this FiO2 level during the experiment to avoid any influence of its variations on PbtO2.",

We conjecture that our method did not induce local complications due to the temperature range of the operation (above 0 \u00b0C) which prevented cold-induced lesions in the mucosa caused by temperatures below this level. Local adverse events reported by previous studies are possibly related to the very low temperature of operation, below 0 \u00b0C [36].",
