The incidence of viral acute pancreatitis is unknown. [12] We report two first-line relatives with acute pancreatitis associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection. According to the current guidelines, [13] the diagnosis of acute pancreatitis requires at least two of the three following signs: 1) abdominal pain, 2) amylase or lipase >3 times the upper normal limit, and 3) characteristic findings on diagnostic imaging. The two cases described in this paper had severe acute pancreatitis, which itself may lead to multiorgan failure including adult respiratory distress and kidney failure as seen in both patients. On the other hand, COVID-19 may also lead to same organ failures and it is therefore not possible to evaluate if the acute pancreatitis contributed to the severe course of the disease. The third family member who was admitted to the intensive care unit with COVID-19 had respiratory distress and gastrointestinal symptoms, but not acute pancreatitis. Additional two family members (not described) tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, but only had mild symptoms and did not require hospitalization. We did not identify a likely explanation for why only two of the five cases developed acute pancreatitis.",

[5, 8, 9] Wang et al. reported at admission 17% of 52 patients with COVID-19 had slightly abnormal amylase or lipase. [14] Several factors may contribute to the development of acute pancreatitis including pancreatic autodigestion, enzyme activation, complement system activation, microcirculation disturbance theory, leukocyte excessive activation, and pancreatic acinar cell apoptosis and pg. 6 necrosis. Theoretically viral pancreatitis develops due to direct destruction of pancreatic acinar cells by inflammation and edema. Alternatively, damage to the pancreatic acinar cells by the virus could lead to a leaking intracellular enzyme or precipitates a process of cell death. The entry receptor Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for SARS-CoV-2 has been identified in the gastrointestinal epithelium of infected cases. During the 2002-2004 outbreak, SARS-CoV used ACE2 for entry to host cells. Increased expression in pancreatic islets were observed, leading eventually to acute diabetes. [15] Genome sequences of SARS-CoV have shown that 79.6% are shared with SARS-CoV-2. [6] The expression of ACE2 in the pancreas during SARS-CoV-2 infection could therefore lead to acute inflammation.",
