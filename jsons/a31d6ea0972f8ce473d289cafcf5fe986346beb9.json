In the present reporl. we examined the possibility that glycosylation of viral proteins could play a major role in interactions with PBMC leading to the production ol\" IFN-i. Con A pretreatment of TGEV-infected cell monolayers before fixation with glutaraldehyde and exposure to PBMC caused adosc-dcpendent inhibition of IFN:e induction, implying that masking of carbohydrates at the surface of infected cells lowered IFN-a-induciion. Similarly, inhibition of N-linked glycosylation by tunicamycin during viral infection of cell monolayers altered their ability to induce IFNa. In addition, complete cleavage of'complex type' oligosaccharides by pcptide-N-glycohydrolase F lowered the capacity of TGEV virions to induce IFNx. Thus, these tindings strongly suggest that glycosylation ofthe vira! proteins, and more precisely the presence of complex-type oligosaceharides, is an important requirement for a completely ellicient interaction with PBMC leading to the production of IFN-a, B.

In contrast. PNGase F caused a complete carbohydrate cleavage leading to the presence ol' only one 26 kDa molecular species. The nucleoprotcin N was not affected by digestion which indicates that proteolytic cleavages of viral polypeptides were unlikely to occur during glycosidase treatments. When ciliquots of virus preparations were incubated with PBMC. a residual PNGase F activity might have directly acted on PBMC. thereby altering their ability to secrete IFNa. This did not appear to be the case since the induction of IFNa remained unchanged in a control experiment in which PNGase F was added to the virus just before incubation with PBMC (Fig. 3) . ",

In our experiments, tunicamycin redueed theability of infected cell monolayers to Induce I FNa (Table  II) , which implies that inhibition of glycosylation in cell monolayers has negative effects on the expression of an \"IFNa-inducing-signal* at the eell surface. However, since tunicamyein ean affect glycosylation ofcell membrane proteins in addition to virus-eoded proteins, it is not possible to determine from these data whether reduction of IFN-induetion is related to the absence of carbohydrate moieties on viral or on cellular proteins. Moreover, tunicamycin could also block the transport ofthe viral apoproleins to the cell surface (see for example. Ref. 20) .",

Three enzymes were used: two glycosidases (endo H and endo F) eleave predominantly high mannose oligosaeeharide chains whereas peplide-N-glycohydrolase V (PNGase F) cleaves both high mannose and 'complex-type' oligosaccharides [27] . Our results show thai PNGase F was the only enzyme which could reduce TGEV virions ability to induce IFNa (Fig. I) . A control experiment showed that this rcduciion was nol due lo a direct efiecl of PNGase F on PBMC (Fig. 3) . When treated virionaliquois were tritratedon PBMC (Fig. I) it appeared that a reduced IFNa-induetion was obtained with diluted PNGase F-treatcd viral preparations whereas high concentrations of PNGase F-treated virus (about 1.5 /ig virions for 5 X 10^ PBMC) induced as much IFNo: as control, endo H-or endo F-treated virus. We have already reported strong evidence for the role of glycoprotein M as the effector viral molecule for IFNxinduction ( [4] ; Laude ct at., submitted for publication). It is therefore interesting to notice that PNGase F was also the only glycosidase tested whieh could cleave completely oligosaecharidcs from the viral protein M. leading to the produetion of a 26 kDa molecule (Fig. 2) . corresponding to the size predicted for the apoprotein M [ 16] and found after tunicamycin treatment (Delmas and Laude. submitted for publication). Moreover, since PNGase F is able to cleave 'complex-type' oligosaccharides in contrast to endo H or endo F [27] . our results indieate that only a complete cleavage of'complex-type' oligosaeeharides from the viral protein M alters the virus\" ability to induce PBMC to produee IFNa.",

It is unlikely that carbohydrates alone are the 'IFNa-inducing signal': in fact, we show here that deglyeosylated virus particles do induce IFNa when exposed at high concentrations to PBMC (Fig. I) . One possible explanation is that glycosylation of viral protein M is an itnportant structural characteristic creating Ihe adequate conformation required for it to interact with a putative receptor on PBMC membrane, leading to activation of IFNa genes. The need for adequate conformation for IFNj-induction was also suggested by our previous observalion that a mutation on the glycoprotein M, which should cause important confor-tnational changes, greatly impaired IFNotinduetion (Laude et at., submitted for publication). The existence of a membrane receptor involved in IFNa-induction was suggested by the results from Lebon [18] that IFNa-induetion was sensitive to lysosomotropic drugs.",

With that respect, adhesion receptors termed \"seleetins\" were recently demonstrated on lymphocytes [25] : these molecules contain an Nterminal lectin domain potentially able to interact with carbohydrates. Cell-surface molecules equivalent to such 'seleetins' could bind virus-associated carbohydrates, which in turn would facilitate stable interactions between PBMC and the actual \"IFN-inducing domain' of the viral polypeptide, leading lo IFNa synlhesis. Obviously it would be interesting to know whether carbohydrates are important for induction of IFNa by viruses other than TGFV. and which of the mechanisms we suggested (i.e.. adequate conformation or adhesion requirement) is involved in the IFNa-induction process. A consequence of our findings is that synthetic peptides corresponding to the M protein or Esherichia coliprodueed unglycosytated reeombinant M proteins by themselves will be unlikely to efficiently induce IFNa, unless used at high concentrations. In addition, carbohydrates such as \"complextype\" oligosaccharides may be useful tools to probe the infrequent leucocyte subpopulation involved in the production of IFNa.",
