Thus supportive care is the main stay of treatment and is focused on prevention of complications, particularly organ failure, ARDS, and secondary bacterial infections.21 Due to the high mortality in hospitalized MERS cases, empiric treatment has been tried on an ad hoc patient basis. Reports of the empiric individual or combination use of steroids, interferons (IFN-\u03b1 and IFN\u2013\u03b2), other generic anti-viral drugs have been tried have been used to treat MERS patients with no significant effects on clinical outcome.22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28 There have been no controlled randomized clinical trials of any treatment intervention performed to date. The use of convalescence plasma, monoclonal antibodies and mycophenolic acid are further options available and require evaluation in controlled clinical trials. There are several anti-MERS-CoV drugs in development but to date no anti-MERS-CoV therapeutics have been developed or approved by regulatory authorities. The unacceptable high mortality rate associated with MERS-CoV and its epidemic potential, indicates an urgent need for development of newer anti-MERS-CoV drugs, vaccines and alternate treatment approaches.29, 30\n",

A large proportion of patients infected with MERS-CoV are either asymptomatic or have mild illness and complete recovery occurs due to effective innate and acquired immune responses which eradicates the infection.31 No comprehensive immunopathogenesis studies have been conducted to date. The protective and deleterious human response to MERS-CoV remains to be determined. Pneumonia and multi-organ involvement is a common feature in patients with MERS.32 The high mortality seen in MERS-CoV could be attributed to acute lung injury, development of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).33 ARDS is associated with leaky alveolar-capillary interfaces with pulmonary oedema, hypoxia, polymorphonuclear leucocytic or lymphocytic cells with upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines and gamma interferon and an aberrant immune response, which results in further tissue damage and deterioration of lung function. Sixty percent of MERS patients with acute lung injury or ARDS either recover after receiving intensive care and 40% of MERS patients succumb to the disease.34\n",

            "text": "A large majority of patients who die due to infection with MERS-CoV may have some form of immunosuppression due to old age or having co-morbid conditions (diabetes, chronic lung, renal, cardiac or liver disease or have an underlying immunosuppressive condition).35 It appears that the outcome of MERS patients may represent a precarious balance of both host- and MERS-CoV-induced immune signaling events.36 It is not known whether mortality is a reflection of an ineffective host response to MERS-CoV or whether an aberrant host immune response contributes to pathogenesis and poor prognosis. Interventions that could manipulate this host-pathogen relationship via modulation of the host response to MERS-CoV infection may help improve mortality rates in patients with MERS.37 For instance, genome analysis suggest that immune signaling modulation may affect outcome,38 and adenosine deaminase may prevent MERS-CoV entry into host cells.39 A range of Host-Directed Therapies (HDTs) have the potential for improving the treatment outcomes of severe lung infections.40\n",
