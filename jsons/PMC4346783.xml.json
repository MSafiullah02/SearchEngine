            "text": "Influenza viruses pose a substantial threat to human and animal health worldwide. Based on the antigenic specificity of their envelope proteins, influenza viruses are classified into three distinct types: A, B, and C. Influenza A virus is the major type that circulates in humans, birds, horses, dogs, and pigs. Influenza virus has a negative sense, single-stranded RNA genome composed of eight segments, which encode up to 13 proteins (Wright et al. 2013). Influenza A virus is further classified into different subtypes based on the antigenic properties of two glycoproteins, the hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA). Influenza virus causes annual epidemics that result in millions of human infections due to the emergence of virus strains arising from high frequency of point mutations (antigenic drift). Furthermore, it also has high potential to cause pandemics, owing to the generation of novel subtypes, especially in animal reservoirs, following the gene reassortments between different influenza viruses (antigenic shift) (Medina and Garcia-Sastre 2011; Tscherne and Garcia-Sastre 2011). Such new variants of influenza virus possess an array of strategies to disarm the host immune system, and enable productive invasion of host cells.\n",

(Taubenberger and Morens 2008). These acute symptoms may last for 7\u201310 days, but in most cases influenza virus infection is self-limiting due to the induction of protective immune response (Valkenburg et al. 2011). Enhanced disease severity associated with high mortality is very common in infants, but also in the elderly and in immunocompromised populations (Taubenberger and Morens 2008). Therefore, a key challenge is learning how to induce protective immunity in populations at the extremes of age and in immune compromised subjects. This in turn requires a much deeper understanding of the nature of the innate and adaptive immune systems in these populations.",

In the United States, more than 36,000 deaths and 200,000 hospitalizations with a total health care cost of $10 billion are associated with influenza infections every year (Mao et al. 2012; Molinari et al. 2007; Taubenberger and Morens 2008). Because of the potentially devastating consequences of influenza pandemics and epidemics, several control measures, such as annual vaccination with either inactivated (IIV) or live attenuated (LAIV) influenza vaccines, are used to prevent the likelihood of future outbreaks. These vaccines incorporate the circulating strains of influenza A/H1, A/H3, and B types, which are expected to emerge in the upcoming season, based on epidemiological data obtained from around the globe (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2011). Immunization with influenza vaccines, similar to virus infection, primarily induces virus-specific antibody responses, in the blood as well as the local respiratory tissues (Clements et al. 1986). Although vaccination induce a protective B cell memory response, the numbers of antibody secreting cells wane rapidly over time (Sasaki et al. 2007), leading to reduced antibody titers, which may not be sufficient to prevent virus infection (Castilla et al. 2013; Song et al. 2010). In addition, the potential for emergence of new strains and particularly novel subtypes of influenza virus against which there is no immunological memory in the population, poses major threats to human health.",

Paradoxically, evidence is also emerging that an exaggerated innate immune response can lead to enhanced pathophysiology including influenza-induced acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in individuals with secondary complications such as chronic respiratory or cardiac illness, or diabetes. In this review, we discuss recent advances in our understanding of innate immunity to influenza virus, with particular emphasis on the different subsets of innate immune cells involved, the nature of the innate receptors that sense the virus, and the antiviral effector molecules. Furthermore, we highlight the contrasting roles played by the innate immune system in mediating protective antiviral immunity to influenza, versus enhanced pathophysiology and disease severity. Most of these insights have resulted from the mechanistic studies in animal models, in which specific subsets of cells or specific receptors have been ablated using gene targeting. However, the extent to which such insights can be translated into the human model is poorly understood. Thus, we review the knowledge gap about the roles of the various subsets of antigen (Ag) presenting cells and other subpopulations of innate immune cells during influenza infection in humans. We emphasize here, the paramount need for future studies deciphering the role of innate immune response to influenza virus at the site of infection in humans. We believe that these studies will facilitate better understanding of the mechanisms that mediate pathogenesis of disease, and in designing improved vaccine and therapeutic strategies against influenza.",

In the majority of individuals infected with the seasonal influenza virus, the virus replication is restricted to the upper respiratory tract (nose, pharynx, and larynx). However, in some cases, the virus can also reach the lower respiratory tract (trachea, bronchi, and lung alveoli) in infections with pandemic strains, especially in children and the elderly. Avian influenza virus, such as H5N1 and H7N9, can even reach the blood circulation to infect cells in distant tissues (Taubenberger and Morens 2008; Tse et al. 2011). Attachment to cells via virus-binding receptors enables endocytic uptake resulting in recognition of the virus through innate receptors, which trigger intricate signaling networks to produce antiviral effector molecules that are capable of conferring the protective immunity.",

Influenza virus causes productive infection of these epithelial cells resulting in the release of large numbers of infectious virus progeny. Notably, the temperature of nose and pharynx is 30\u201334 \u00b0C, which is relatively lower than the tracheal and internal body temperature (36\u201337 \u00b0C). Human influenza viruses, but not avian viruses, can replicate efficiently at this lower temperature of upper respiratory tract, similar to that at 37 \u00b0C (Boonnak et al. 2012; Pelletier et al. 2011). Although different innate immune cells are found in nasal and pharyngeal cavity, the functional features of innate immunity against pathogens at this lower temperature is not known.",

Furthermore, influenza virus-infected epithelial cells trigger recruitment of an array of innate immune cells, which participate in the protective immune response (Table 1). Interestingly, a recent study in mice showed that expression of GM-CSF by influenza virus-infected alveolar epithelium is essential for effective viral clearance mediated by CD103+ DC-induced CD8+ T cells (Unkel et al. 2012).",

Although influenza viruses are phagocytized by neutrophils in humans and mice (Brandes et al. 2013), neutrophils are not permissible for productive infection in vitro (Tate et al. 2011). Neutrophils are shown to be important for controlling replication and spread of influenza virus in mouse models (Fujisawa 2001). Lethal dose infection of mice depleted of neutrophils results in increased virus titers in the lungs and in extrapulmonary sites with increased mortality (Tate et al. 2008, 2009, 2011; Tumpey et al. 2005) (Table 1). Consistent with this, in an in vitro culture of human bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), addition of neutrophils, particularly activated neutrophils, resulted in significantly greater clearance of influenza virus (White et al. 2007). As phagocytic cells, neutrophils can uptake influenza virus-infected apoptotic cells in the lungs to augment clearance of virus (Hashimoto et al. 2007; Watanabe et al. 2005). Despite neutrophils being important participants in the antiviral response in mouse models, the phenotype and functional relevance of large number of neutrophils that accumulate at the site of infection in influenza virus-infected patients, and their mechanisms of anti viral immunity, are poorly understood.",

In mouse models, during the course of influenza virus infection, aM\u03a6 are outnumbered by the migrant monocytes, which differentiate into M\u03a6 with an activated phenotype (Herold et al. 2008). Because of their efficient phagocytic capacity, like neutrophils M\u03a6 are critical for clearance of virus-infected and apoptotic cells (Hashimoto et al. 2007; Hoeve et al. 2012; Watanabe et al. 2005). In the absence of M\u03a6, influenza virus replication is enhanced, leading to greater disease severity and mortality, in mice and pigs (Ito et al. 2011; Kim et al. 2008, 2013; Tate et al. 2010; Tumpey et al. 2005). In humans, most of the studies were done employing in vitro culture of aM\u03a6 obtained from BALF or lung specimens and blood monocyte-derived M\u03a6 (moM\u03a6). Compared to moM\u03a6, aM\u03a6 are considered to be resistant to productive infection with the seasonal human influenza virus strains in vitro. Consistent with this, influenza virus replication and induction of proinflammatory cytokine responses were much poorer in aM\u03a6 when compared with moM\u03a6 (van Riel et al. 2011). In the case of avian influenza, however, the virus is able to productively infect both moM\u03a6 and aM\u03a6 (reviewed in Short et al. 2012). Notably, highly pathogenic H5N1 viruses are found to induce more potent proinflammatory cytokine responses, and IFN production than seasonal human viruses (Cheung et al. 2002; Geiler et al. 2011; Lee et al. 2009; Perrone et al. 2008; Yu et al. 2011; Zhou et al. 2006). Moreover, aM\u03a6 are believed to be the main producers of type I IFN, since they are shown to produce significantly more type I IFNs than DCs during influenza virus infection (Helft et al. 2012). Thus, M\u03a6 appear to play critical role in the early innate response to influenza virus infection.\n",

Interestingly, in influenza virus-infected mice, type I IFN-signaling was found to augment the differentiation of stem cells into CCL2-producing monocytes, which mediate the recruitment of additional monocytes (Brandes et al. 2013; Seo et al. 2011). Consistent with this, influenza virus infection of human monocytes induces the release of CCL2 and CXCL10 (Hoeve et al. 2012; Maddur and Pulendran, unpublished data), but inhibits the responsiveness to chemokines, such as CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, and CCL5 by downregulation of their respective chemokine receptors (Salentin et al. 2003), presumably to retain these cells at the site of infection.\n",

In vitro studies have shown that productive influenza virus infection of human monocytes induces secretion of TNF-\u03b1 and GM-CSF, and triggers rapid transformation into cells with phenotypic features of DCs (Cao et al. 2012; Hou et al. 2012; Qu et al. 2003). In contrast, we found that infection of monocytes with influenza virus did not induce activation and TNF-\u03b1 secretion, but merely induces the loss of CD14 resulting in DC-like phenotype (CD11c+CD14\u2212). Despite the phenotypic similarity to DCs, these CD14\u2212 cells lack the functional properties of DCs (Maddur and Pulendran unpublished data). Mice with reduced numbers of monocytes at the site of infection, such as CCR2\u2212/\u2212 mice or mice treated with a CCR2 antagonist did not show increased viral loads, raising the question of the direct role of monocytes in virus clearance (Lin et al. 2008, 2011). Furthermore, the relevance of these findings of mouse models and in vitro studies to influenza human patients is not clear and is worth investigating for understanding the role of monocytes in influenza.",

In the steady-state respiratory tract, the epithelial layer of conducting airways is lined by CD103+CD11blo cDCs (langerin+), which extends their long dendrites into the airway lumen. The lamina propria, which is beneath the epithelial layer, contains CD103\u2212CD11bhi cDCs (langerin\u2212) as well as CD11clo pDCs. Further, all the three DC subsets are found in the alveolar septa of lung parenchyma. Under inflammatory conditions, additional CD11cloCD11b+Ly6C+ moDCs are recruited to the conducting airways and lung parenchyma (Guilliams et al. 2013; Helft et al. 2010; Lambrecht and Hammad 2009, 2012). Of note, in the lungs, M\u03a6 subsets, which are CD11chi, must be distinguished from cDCs based on other markers (Table 1). The respiratory tract draining lymphoid tissues contain resident DC subsets such as, CD8\u03b1+ cDCs, and CD11b+ cDCs as well as CD11clo pDCs, in addition to migratory DCs (Haniffa et al. 2013; Helft et al. 2010).",

Furthermore, influenza virus infection induced activation of human DC subsets including CD1c+ mDC1, pDC and moDCs characterized by upregulation of expression of HLA-DR, HLA-ABC, CD80, CD86, CD40, and CCR7 (Fonteneau et al. 2003; Larsson et al. 2000; le Nouen et al. 2011; Osterlund et al. 2005; Piqueras et al. 2006; Smed-Sorensen et al. 2012). Interestingly, although enhanced production of IL-6, IL-8, and CCL2 was observed in pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza virus-infected patients (Lee et al. 2011), in vitro virus infection failed to enhance cytokine secretion in human moDCs (Osterlund et al. 2010). Consistent with this, influenza virus infection of moDCs failed to induce maturation and production of IFN-\u03b1, TNF-\u03b1, and IL-6, due to the suppressive effects of NS1 protein (Fernandez-Sesma et al. 2006). Notably, exposure to type I IFNs prior to influenza virus infection was found to enhance the activation and cytokine secretion of mDCs and pDCs, by partially overcoming the inhibition by IFN antagonist NS1 protein of influenza virus (Fernandez-Sesma et al. 2006; Phipps-Yonas et al. 2008).",

However, in contrast to these in vitro findings, virus infection was associated with transient deficiency of circulating NK cells, particularly CD56+++ NK cells, and downregulation of NK cell activity, especially with pandemic H1N1 2009 influenza patients (Denney et al. 2010; Fox et al. 2012; Guo et al. 2011; Heltzer et al. 2009). It is not clear whether the reduced number of NK cells in peripheral blood is a reflection of augmented recruitment of NK cells to the site of infection, the respiratory tract. However, the fatal cases of influenza virus infections showed reduced number or absence of NK cells in lung inflammatory infiltrate (Denney et al. 2010; Welliver et al. 2007). Consistent with this, studies have found that influenza virus-infection of NK cells inhibits their functions of cytotoxicity and cytokine and chemokine secretion in humans (Mao et al. 2010) as well as in mice (Guo et al. 2009).",

In mice lacking T cells and B cells, ILC2 cells were found to accumulate in the lungs following sublethal influenza virus infection, and were critical for sustaining lung epithelial barrier and remodeling of respiratory tissue through secretion of amphiregulin (Monticelli et al. 2011). In contrast, sublethal influenza virus infection triggered airway hyper-reactivity (AHR) is shown to be mediated by IL-5 and IL-13\u2013producing ILC2 (natural helper cells) that are activated by IL-33 secreted by aM\u03a6 and NKT cells (Chang et al. 2011; Gorski et al. 2013).

The SA and its linkage is critical for facilitating influenza virus infection of epithelial and immune cells, since enzymatic switching of SA linkage or removal of cell-surface SA can alter susceptibility or confer resistance to influenza virus infection.

However, study using UV-inactivated genetically modified human influenza viruses showed that virus binding to SA\u03b12,3Gal induced higher levels of proinflammatory cytokines and IFN-inducible genes in DCs and M\u03a6 compared to influenza virus with SA\u03b12,6Gal binding specificity (Ramos et al. 2011), suggesting a viral replication-independent induction of innate response. These finding indicate that the binding of SA-containing receptors to HA can induce differential innate antiviral responses. Further, inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) used in humans is a split vaccine mainly containing HA, and hence, the interaction of IIV with SA-containing receptors is likely to play role in the vaccine-induced immunity. Therefore, deciphering the identity, structure, and functional features (like cytoplasmic signaling network) of SA-containing receptors involved in influenza is warranted.",

Consistent with this, several cell surface carbohydrate-recognizing receptors are also proposed in binding to sugar residues within the surface glycoproteins of influenza virus to augment virus uptake. They include C-type lectin receptors (CLRs), which are the innate recognition receptors of host (discussed below).",

They can mediate influenza virus binding to augment the SA-dependent virus up take by cells resulting in enhanced susceptibility to infection. However, these receptors alone do not mediate efficient infection in the absence of SA (Londrigan et al. 2011; Wang et al. 2008). Furthermore, these CLRs, which are known to bind influenza virus lack both activating-ITAM as well as inhibitory-ITIM cytoplasmic signaling motifs, but possess tyrosine motifs involved in endocytosis (Geijtenbeek and Gringhuis 2009; Sancho and Reis e Sousa 2012). Hence, based on the recent findings, it is speculated that virus-bound CLRs can employ the endocytic equipment to direct the captured viral antigenic cargo for processing and cross-presentation to T cells, especially MMR and MGL (Sancho and Reis e Sousa 2012). Furthermore, despite being unable to induce myeloid cell activation by themselves, these CLRs, particularly DC-SIGN, are found to modulate the outcome of signaling by other PRRs (Geijtenbeek and Gringhuis 2009; Sancho and Reis e Sousa 2012). It is therefore important to determine the effect of binding of influenza virus to these CLRs on the activation and function of myeloid cells induced by other PRRs, and also the ensuing CD8+ T cell immune response.",

TLR7-mediated sensing of inactivated-influenza virus by pDCs is required to confer protective primary adaptive immune response in mice (Geeraedts et al. 2008; Koyama et al. 2007, 2010). In contrast, cytokine production in the lungs following live influenza virus infection did not require TLR7-signaling in pDCs (Koyama et al. 2010). Despite the uncontrolled viral load and mortality observed in TLR7/MyD88-deficit mice infected with lethal dose of influenza virus in a previous study (Seo et al. 2010), the lack of TLR7 did not markedly alter the viral load, disease pathology and inflammatory cytokine response in following lethal dose (Jeisy-Scott et al. 2011) or sublethal dose (Pang et al. 2013b). Consistent with this finding, TLR7-induced type I IFN in pDCs was dispensable for induction of protective response to influenza virus in mice vaccinated with live-virus vaccine (Koyama et al. 2010). Furthermore, IFN-\u03b1 secretion by murine mDC/BMDCs in response to influenza virus is found to be dependent on live virus replication, but not on TLR7/MyD88- signaling (Barchet et al. 2005; Koyama et al. 2007). Nevertheless, in murine BMDCs, TLR7-signaling was required for the induction of pro-IL-1\u03b2 and secretion of mature IL-1\u03b2 after influenza virus infection (Ichinohe et al. 2010). These results suggest a cell-specific role of TLR7 in the induction of innate immune response to influenza virus infection as well as vaccination.",

Furthermore, similar to TLR4 deficient mice (Nhu et al. 2010), treatment of mice with a TLR4 antagonist, Eritoran, was found to protect from lethal influenza infection by alleviating lung pathology, clinical symptoms, cytokine, and oxidized phospholipid expression, as well as by controlling viral loads, a process dependent on CD14 and TLR2 expression (Shirey et al. 2013).

RLRs represent a family of RNA helicases, which includes three members, RIG-I, melanoma differentiation-associated gene 5 (MDA5), and laboratory of genetics and physiology-2 (LGP-2) (Takeuchi and Akira 2009). In addition to the RNA helicase domain, RIG-I and MDA5 contain two N-terminal caspase recruitment domains (CARDs), whereas LGP2 lacks a CARD component, and functions as a negative regulator of RIG-I/MDA5-signaling (Loo and Gale 2011). RIG-I recognizes RNA containing 5\u2019-triphosphate with panhandle-like secondary structures, whereas MDA5 preferentially senses long dsRNA (>2 kb) (Takeuchi and Akira 2009). RLRs signal through a common adaptor IFN-\u03b2 promoter stimulator-1 (IPS-1), also known as mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS) leading to phosphorylation of IRF7/3 and NF-kB , which in turn induce type I IFNs, and proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, respectively (Loo and Gale 2011). The recruitment of the adaptor MAVS is dependent on E3-ligase tripartite motif containing 25 (TRIM25)- and Riplet-dependent ubiquitination of RIG-I (Loo and Gale 2011). Under steady state, RLR is expressed at low levels, but is greatly increased in response to IFN and after virus infection (Loo and Gale 2011) (Fig. 1).",

Of note, a recent study revealed that influenza virus lacking NS1 induces antiviral stress granules that contain viral RNA together with RIG-I and antiviral proteins including protein kinase R (PKR). These antiviral stress granules are shown to serve as the site of 5\u2019ppp RNA-induced activation of RIG-I-signaling (Onomoto et al. 2012). Consistent with this, influenza virus infection boosted an early transient expression and activation of RIG-I in respiratory epithelial cells (Crotta et al. 2013; le Goffic et al. 2007), M\u03a6 (Ohman et al. 2009; Wang et al. 2012), BMDCs (Koyama et al. 2007) and mast cells (Graham et al. 2013). Although dispensable for viral control following sublethal dose, signaling from RIG-I and TLR7 was required for survival and restricting the virus growth after lethal dose influenza infection in mice (Koyama et al. 2007; Pang et al. 2013b). Furthermore, expression on RIG-I and MDA5 were enhanced in peripheral blood cells (Lee et al. 2013) and patients who exhibit a polymorphism resulting in the expression of a nonfunctional variant of RIG-I were severely attenuated in antiviral responses against influenza virus (Pothlichet et al. 2009). These findings support an important role for the RIG-I-mediated responses in restraining the influenza virus.",

Signal 1 is initiated by the detection of viral RNA by TLR7, which activates NF-kB. Although initial studies showed that NLRP3 detects influenza virus via recognition of viral RNA (Allen et al. 2009; Thomas et al. 2009), it is now clear that many sources contribute to signal 2 either in combination or alone, and all depend on the newly synthesized viral M2 protein. These include, (i) ionic imbalance of the trans-Golgi pH, (ii) potassium efflux through the P2X7 receptor, an ATP-gated cation channel, (iii) lysosomal maturation and release of cathepsin B and (iv) cellular reactive oxygen species (Ichinohe et al. 2010; Lietzen et al. 2011) (Fig. 1). Recently, influenza virus virulence protein polymerase basic protein 1-frame 2 (PB1-F2) alone in aggregated form was found to be sufficient to activate NLRP3 inflammasome-induced IL-1\u03b2 (McAuley et al. 2013). In addition, recent evidences support the role of commensal microbiota derived PAMPs as signal 1 for NLRP3 inflammasome activation (Ichinohe et al. 2011). Despite these findings, the specific PAMP in influenza virus interacting with NLRP3 is not yet known. Apart from the cleavage of pro-IL-1\u03b2 and pro-IL-18, NLRP3-inflammasome activation also results in the initiation of a proinflammatory form of cell death known as pyroptosis (Schroder and Tschopp 2010).",

Accordingly, mice lacking any of the NLRP3 inflammasome components did not produce IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 following the high-lethal dose influenza virus infection (Allen et al. 2009; Thomas et al. 2009). Furthermore, NLRP3-deficient mice showed a reduced protective inflammation including the suppressed accumulation of neutrophils and monocytes to the lungs and airways upon influenza virus infection, which resulted in higher mortality (Allen et al. 2009; Thomas et al. 2009). Strikingly, NLRP3-deficient mice showed collagen deposits in lungs suggesting the delayed resolution of lung injury due to the absence of pro-fibrotic role of IL-1\u03b2 (Thomas et al. 2009). Notably, the inflammasome complex was found to be dispensable for early clearance (up to 6 days) of the virus (Thomas et al. 2009), but was essential for reducing the viral load in later stage of infection (Allen et al. 2009; Ichinohe et al. 2009). These findings suggested that NLRP3-inflammasome induced inflammatory response, rather than direct viral control, mediates the protective immunity to influenza virus infection, possibly via adaptive immune responses.",

In agreement, NOD2-deficient mice showed decreased type I IFNs and DC activation, and exhibited enhanced susceptibility to lethal dose virus-induced pathogenesis (Lupfer et al. 2014; Sabbah et al. 2009). Further, NLRX1, NLR located in mitochondria, binds to viral protein PB1-F2. NLRX-signaling prevents virus-induced M\u03a6 apoptosis and promotes both M\u03a6 survival as well as type I IFN signaling in mice infection with lethal dose (Jaworska et al. 2014). On contrary, NOD2 and NLRX1 are found to negatively regulate the NLRP3 and RIG-induced inflammatory response to lethal dose influenza virus, respectively, and control the immunopathology (Allen et al. 2011; Lupfer et al. 2013). Together, these findings suggest that NLRs execute differential role in response to influenza virus infection to obtain a balanced innate immunity.",

In case of influenza virus, this is shown to be mediated by the panhandle secondary structure formed by 5\u2019ppp end of RNA (Dauber et al. 2009). While there have been multiple substrates identified for PKR, most of the antiviral activity of PKR is due to phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1, which results in a general translational block, limiting viral replication (Pindel and Sadler 2011). NS1 of influenza A virus inhibits the activity of PKR (Li et al. 2006), and PKR-KO mice are highly susceptible to infection with NS1 defective influenza A virus (Bergmann et al. 2000), highlighting the contribution of PKR in restricting influenza virus replication. In addition to its role in inhibiting the translation of viral RNA, PKR activation also initiates signal transduction via NF-kB leading to cell growth arrest and autophagy, which result in an enhanced anti-viral immunity (Sadler and Williams 2008).",

However, blood monocyte-derived moDC recruited to LN are reported to stimulate IL-12p70-mediated Th1 response in mice (Nakano et al. 2009). Recent studies in influenza-infected mice (Leon et al. 2014) and influenza-vaccinated humans (Bentebibel et al. 2013) showed that follicular CD4+ T (Tfh) cells are present in LN and circulation, respectively, and are essential for germinal center (GC) reactions and antibody production. Notably, pDCs were found to be essential for enhancement of virus-specific primary antibody response following influenza infection (GeurtsvanKessel et al. 2008; McGill et al. 2008) and vaccination (Koyama et al. 2010). Further, CD11chi cDCs in the lungs were crucial for maintenance of GC reactions in tertiary lymphoid structures, and to sustain virus-specific antibodies (GeurtsvanKessel et al. 2009). Despite these observations, the role of DC subsets in the generation of Tfh cells and primary antibody response is not clearly known.",

Strikingly, influenza virus-activated pDCs were able to induce a strong Th1 polarization through synergistic effect of IL-12 and type I IFNs (Cella et al. 2000). Furthermore, influenza virus triggered secretion of type I IFNs and IL-6 from pDCs induced differentiation of plasma cells and virus-specific antibody production from B cells activated by T cells (Jego et al. 2003). These findings indicate that human mDCs are likely important for the induction of CD8+ T cell response and that of pDCs in CD4+ T cell-dependent virus-specific antibody response.",

Surprisingly, TLR7/MyD88 and RIG-I-signaling are also found to play negligible roles in CD8+ T cell activation and effector functions in sublethal dose influenza virus-infected mice (Heer et al. 2007; Koyama et al. 2007; Pang et al. 2013a). However, CD4+ T cell response, the number of antibody-secreting cells in secondary lymphoid organs, and the production of virus-specific antibodies following sublethal intranasal infection were dependent on TLR7 signaling, but not RIG-I signaling (Jeisy-Scott et al. 2012; Koyama et al. 2007). Furthermore, TLR7-signaling in pDCs, was essential for protective antibody response induced by virion RNA-containing split vaccine (Jeisy-Scott et al. 2012) and inactivated whole virus vaccine (Koyama et al. 2007, 2010) (Table 2). Here, along with stimulation of TLRs on B cells, TLR7-mediated induction of type I IFNs in pDCs was found to be critical for T cell-dependent antibody response following infection and vaccination (Heer et al. 2007; Koyama et al. 2010). Based on these findings, it appears that TLRs rather than RLRs contribute to the induction of effective T cell-dependent antibody response to influenza virus, whereas TLR-independent and RLR-independent mechanisms might exist with regards to CD8+ T cell responses. In this context, our recent study showed that activation of induced general control nonderepressible 2 kinase (GCN2) in DCs by the yellow fever vaccine (YF-17D) is crucial for generation of CD8+ T cell response through autophagy and enhanced Ag presentation (Ravindran et al. 2014). Interestingly, induction of CD8+ T cell responses to the LAIV was also dependent on GCN2 (Ravindran et al. 2014).",

Furthermore, microbiota-mediated NLRP3-inflammasome-caspase-1 activation-induced IL-1\u03b2 is believed to be essential for activation and migration of DCs from the lungs to the LN for T cell priming during sublethal dose influenza virus infection in mice (Ichinohe et al. 2011). Supporting these previous findings, a recent study showed that signaling through the IL-1R (by IL-1\u03b2/IL-1\u03b1) in uninfected DCs carrying viral Ag was required and sufficient for productive priming of CD8+ T cells, but signaling through TLR7 and RIG-I was dispensable (Pang et al. 2013a). In contrast, a previous study found that antibody production, as well as the influenza virus-specific CD8+ T cell number in the BAL, of both Nlrp3 and caspase-1-deficient mice was similar to wild type mice infected with sublethal dose of influenza virus between 7 and 11 days of infection (Thomas et al. 2009) (Table 2). While several studies favored the role of influenza virus-triggered caspase-1 activation in CD8+ T cell response, further studies are needed to clarify these findings. A recent study revealed that NOD2-deficiency causes reduced generation of virus-specific CD8+ T cell response following lethal infection in mice (Lupfer et al. 2014) (Table 2).",

While LAIV induced the expression of several interferon-related genes, which are similar to live viral vaccines, the TIV induced a signature composed of genes highly expressed in plasma B cells (Nakaya et al. 2011). For TIV, of the 44 genes identified to accurately predict the outcome of immunization as either high or low antibody titers, one gene-CAMKIV- had no known function in regulating immunity, but was negatively correlated with antibody titers. Consistent with this, CAMKIV-deficit mice developed high antibody titers after vaccination (Nakaya et al. 2011). Furthermore, the expression of TLR5 few days after TIV administration highly correlated with the antibody titers 4 weeks post vaccination. However, TIV did not activate TLR5 signaling per se (Jason and Pulendran unpublished data). TLR5 is sensor of bacterial flagellin, which could be derived from commensal flora. In this context, perturbation of gut microbiota was found to influence the host immune response involved in the clearance of virus from lungs in influenza infected mice (Ichinohe et al. 2011). Consistent with this, our preliminary results support the significant influence of intestinal flora on TIV-induced antibody response in mouse model (Jason and Pulendran unpublished data).",

A temporal pattern of host molecular responses was identified by systems biology approach in the peripheral blood of influenza virus-infected human volunteers, which differentiated symptomatic from asymptomatic infections of influenza virus strains (Huang et al. 2011; Woods et al. 2013). Further, while symptomatic patients showed multiple PRR-mediated antiviral and inflammatory responses, asymptomatic individuals revealed a highly regulated antiviral responses together with enhanced cell-mediated and antioxidant responses (Huang et al. 2011; Woods et al. 2013). Similarly, differential induction of inflammatory gene expression is observed in the mouse lungs following infection with influenza virus causing mild or severe respiratory disease, which is largely accounted by neutrophils (Brandes et al. 2013; Kash et al. 2006; Korth et al. 2013). Furthermore, by integrating the large-scale lipid measurements with targeted gene expression, a recent study in influenza mouse model and human patients showed that 5-lipoxygenase metabolites correlate with the pathogenic phase of the infection, whereas 12/15-lipoxygenase metabolites associate with the resolution phase (Tam et al. 2013).",

At the cellular level, respiratory epithelial cells being the primary target support the viral replication to release progeny viruses; but together with DCs and M\u03a6, trigger trafficking of increased number of immune cells to the site of infection. Uptake of influenza virus mainly through the SA-containing receptors and recognition of viral components by the innate receptors trigger activation and upregulation of antiviral program in respiratory epithelial as well as immune cells recruited to the airways. Antiviral innate response mainly includes type I and III IFNs and the IFN-stimulated genes, in addition to various inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Although innate immunity seems to achieve the protective viral clearance in concert with adaptive immune response, damaging role of innate immunity in the pathogenesis of influenza is also emerging with the recent studies. Of note, variation in the amplitude of innate immune response has been linked to both virus dose and strains as well as host factors.",

Activation of TLRs upon detection of viral RNA (TLR3 and TLR7/8) or binding of death-associated molecular patterns (DAMPS; TLR4) recruits adaptor molecules (MyD88 and TRIF) triggering distinct signaling pathways that activates nuclear translocation of transcription factors (IRF3/7 and NF-kB) to induce production of type I interferons (I IFNs) and inflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF and pro-IL-1\u03b2 and -IL-18). Recognition of 5\u2019ppp-RNA by RIG-I activates recruitment of MAVS on mitochondrion, which in turn induces the production of cytokines through IRF3/IRF7. Of the NLRs, NOD2 detects ssRNA to activate translocation of MAPK and IRF3/IRF7 by recruiting adaptor molecules, RIPK2 and MAVS, respectively, to induce cytokine production. Activation of NLRP3 mediated by diverse stimuli, dependent on ionic channel M2 protein of influenza virus, recruits ASC (apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain), which in turn interact with pro-caspase-1 to form NLRP3 inflammasome. Autoactivation of caspase-1 cleaves pro-IL-1\u03b2/IL-18 to mature IL-1\u03b2/IL-18 for their secretion",

Innate immune cells, particularly dendritic cells (DCs) in the respiratory tissues acquire antigens either through direct infection or by uptake of influenza-infected dead cells and undergo maturation process triggered by TLR7 or RIG-I-signaling, under the influence of type I IFNs produced by macrophages and pDCs. Respiratory DC subsets (CD103+ cDCs, CD11b+ cDCs and pDCs) migrate to the draining lymph node (LN), where they can transfer influenza antigens (Ag) to LN-resident CD8\u03b1+ cDC. In the LN, respiratory CD103+ cDCs together with CD8\u03b1+ cDCs stimulate the na\u00efve CD8+ T cells to proliferate and differentiate into cytotoxic effector CD8+ T cells, in a CD24-dependent manner. On the other hand, CD11b+ cDCs drive the activation of CD8+ T cells, mainly effector T cells at later stage of infection, to induce memory CD8+ T cells. Interaction of na\u00efve CD4+ T cells with cDCs generates IFN-\u03b3-producing Th1 cells, which in turn facilitates the differentiation of effector B cells in a TLR7-dependent manner.
