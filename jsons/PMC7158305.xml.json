Bundles of smooth muscle and elastic fibers surround the large ducts. Myoepithelial cells can be found between the alveolar epithelial cells and underlying basement membrane.

Foam cells are large, individualized cells characterized by round to oval, eccentrically located nuclei and abundant amounts of vacuolated cytoplasm (Allison and Maddux, 2008). These cells may also contain amorphous, basophilic secretory material (Fig. 12-4\n). Foam cells resemble and can be difficult to distinguish from reactive macrophages. FNA cytology of normal mammary tissue usually reveals small amounts of blood with no to low numbers of nucleated cells, moderate to large amounts of basophilic proteinaceous material, clear lipid droplets, and adipocytes (Allen et al., 1986). Small sheets and clusters of mammary secretory epithelial cells that are uniform in size and shape may be seen occasionally in aspirates of normal mammary tissue. Secretory epithelial cells exhibit round, dark nuclei and moderate amounts of basophilic cytoplasm. Acinar formations may be noted. Ductular epithelial cells are characterized by oval, basal nuclei with scant amounts of cytoplasm. Myoepithelial cells may be seen as darkly staining, oval free nuclei or as spindle-shaped cells (Allison and Maddux, 2008).",

Formation of FCD may have a hormonal component because the administration of medroxyprogesterone has been associated with development of FCD in dogs.

The nodule(s) exhibit slow, expansile growth, and the overlying skin may develop a blue color, hence the term blue-dome cyst (Brodey et al., 1983). Mammary cysts may be classified as simple cysts characterized by a single layer of flattened lining epithelium or papillary cysts containing papillary outgrowths of the lining epithelial cells. Aspiration of mammary cysts typically yields a green-brown or blood-tinged fluid containing low numbers of foam cells and pigment-laden macrophages (Allison and Maddux, 2008). Neutrophils may be increased if inflammation is also present. Cholesterol crystals, which appear as large, rectangular crystalline structures often with a notched corner, may be present as a result of breakdown of cellular membranes within the cyst (Fig. 12-5\n). Epithelial cells derived from the cystic lining may be noted, particularly if the cyst has a papillary component. These cells tend to occur in dense sheets and clusters and may display some mild variation in nuclear size and shape. Mammary cysts may coexist with benign and/or malignant mammary tumors (Brodey et al., 1983). Therefore, aspiration or biopsy of solid areas of a mass associated with a cyst or other mammary masses should be performed to rule out the presence of concurrent mammary neoplasia.",

Mammary hyperplasia is characterized by proliferations of secretory or ductular epithelium or myoepithelial cells resembling the physiologic hyperplasia of pregnancy with some mild histologic atypia. Cytologically, these lesions may be difficult to distinguish from each other and from benign neoplasms such as adenomas or duct papillomas. Moderate to large numbers of epithelial cells arranged in sheets and clusters can be aspirated from hyperplastic mammary tissue. These cells, which are similar in appearance to normal mammary epithelial cells, display round nuclei with fine to lightly stippled chromatin of uniform size and shape and scant to moderate amounts of basophilic cytoplasm.

            "text": "In cats, a form of mammary hyperplasia occurs that has been variously identified as fibroepithelial hyperplasia, feline mammary hypertrophy, mammary fibroadenomatous hyperplasia, or feline mammary hypertrophy/fibroadenomatous complex. Feline mammary fibroepithelial hyperplasia (MFH) is a clinically benign, fairly common condition affecting estrous-cycling, pregnant, or pseudopregnant female cats usually less than 2 years of age (Mesher, 1997). MFH can also occur subsequent to treatment with progesterone or synthetic progestogens (Gim\u00e9nez et al., 2010, Leidinger et al., 2011). MFH has also been reported in older intact and neutered cats of either gender (Gim\u00e9nez et al., 2010, Leidinger et al., 2011) mostly after receiving progesterone-containing compounds, such as megestrol acetate (Hayden et al., 1989) or depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (Loretti et al., 2005, Sontas et al., 2008). MFH is considered a form of mammary dysplasia characterized by a rapid, abnormal growth of one or more mammary glands without milk production. The mammary glands may be edematous, painful, ulcerative, and sometimes so large that animals have difficulty walking (Gim\u00e9nez et al., 2010). Systemic signs might include tachycardia, lethargy, and anorexia (Gim\u00e9nez et al., 2010). In contrast to a neoplastic process, paired glands often exhibit a similar degree of enlargement (Lana et al., 2007). MFH is notable for a marked intralobular ductular proliferation identical to that seen during the progesterone-influenced early stages of pregnancy (Misdorp et al., 1999). This typical histologic appearance, along with the occurrence in cycling females or cats administered progesterone and the identification of estrogen and progesterone receptors in MFH lesions from female and male cats (Mart\u00edn De Las Mulas et al., 2000, Ord\u00e1s et al., 2004), suggests that both hormones are involved. MFH usually regresses over time without treatment, although secondary infections may require appropriate antibiotic therapy. Ovariohysterectomy, performed via a flank incision if the glands are greatly enlarged, will often result in regression of lesions and will prevent future recurrences (Lana et al., 2007). However, some cats do not respond to withdrawal of progestogens or ovariectomy and can be treated successfully with the progesterone receptor blocker aglepristone (G\u00f6rlinger et al., 2002).",

Aspirated material of a histologically confirmed MFH lesion consists of a very uniform population of cuboidal epithelial cells arranged in thick clusters. The cuboidal epithelial cells are characterized by dense, round nuclei with small nucleoli and scant amounts of basophilic cytoplasm and mild atypia. A mesenchymal population of spindle-shaped cells with narrow oval nuclei, one to two nucleoli, and tapering cytoplasm is also present. The mesenchymal cells display moderate variation in nuclear size (anisokaryosis) and cellular size (anisocytosis). Moderate amounts of pink extracellular matrix are associated with the mesenchymal cells. These cytologic findings correlate with the histologic findings of hyperplastic ductular epithelium (cuboidal epithelial population) and proliferation of edematous stroma (mesenchymal cells with extracellular matrix). Cytologic recognition of the characteristic cell types from mammary masses in a cat with appropriate signalment, clinical history, clinical presentation, and ultrasonographic findings can be considered highly suggestive of MFH, thus eliminating the need for mammary gland excision and allowing for appropriate medical and/or surgical management (Gim\u00e9nez et al., 2010, Leidinger et al., 2011). However, the cytologic features of MFH cannot be always distinguishable from true benign mammary neoplasms.",

Mastitis may infrequently occur from hematogenous spread of organisms, nonlactation-associated trauma, fight wounds, or infected neoplasms. Dirofilaria repens infection of the mammary gland in the bitch (Manuali et al., 2005), mycotic mastitis due to Blastomyces dermatitidis in three dogs (Ditmyer and Craig, 2011), and mastitis due to Toxoplasma gondii in a cat (Park et al., 2007) have been reported. Mastitis is most often associated with postparturient lactation. It can also occur during pseudopregnancy and after early weaning of puppies or kittens. It is thought to result from entry of infectious organisms through the teat orifice or damaged overlying skin (Gruffydd-Jones, 1980). Neonatal morbidity or mortality may be the first indication of mastitis. Clinical signs associated with mastitis include swollen, painful glands that result in discomfort while nursing. The glands may become abscessed or gangrenous with necrosis of overlying skin. The bitch or queen may also present with clinical signs of systemic illness such as anorexia, fever, vomiting, or diarrhea. A complete blood count may reveal an inflammatory leukogram characterized by either an increase in segmented and nonsegmented (band) neutrophils or a degenerative left shift with a predominance of immature neutrophils, especially if gangrenous mastitis is present (Ververidis et al., 2007).",

The median age for development of canine MGT is 10 to 11 years of age, with rare occurrence in bitches younger than 4 years old.

            "text": "Most MGT are of epithelial origin. Some tumors are composed of both epithelial and myoepithelial tissue, with areas of cartilage and bone, and a few tumors are of purely mesenchymal origin. About 50% of canine MGT have been classified as malignant based on histologic appearance (Brodey et al., 1983). While some classifications of MGT, such as carcinosarcomas or sarcomas, have a consistently poor prognosis, histologic evidence of malignancy does not always imply a malignant course (Lana et al., 2007). In fact, only 50% of histologically diagnosed mammary carcinomas result in tumor-associated deaths (Brodey et al., 1983). Morphologic criteria of malignancy, such as cellular pleomorphism, mitotic activity, and individual grades of anaplasia, are not sufficient criteria for the diagnosis of carcinomas. Instead, infiltration into skin and soft tissues and invasion of tumor cells into blood or lymphatic vessels have been identified as the best histologic evidence of malignancy in mammary tumors (Misdorp, 2002). When stromal invasion is present, 80% of affected dogs will be dead within 2 years, whereas when it is absent, 80% of affected dogs will be alive after 2 years (Yager et al., 1993). Using stromal invasion as the primary criteria for malignancy, a lifespan study of over a thousand Beagles was reported that correlated the various histologic classifications of epithelial mammary tumors with biologic behavior (Benjamin et al., 1999). Specifically, the study showed that ductular carcinomas accounted for 65.8% of all fatalities due to mammary neoplasia, even though these tumors comprised only 18.7% of all mammary carcinomas. Of the malignant tumors, squamous cell carcinomas exhibited the lowest metastatic rate (20%) and carcinosarcomas exhibited the highest (100%). Ductular carcinomas metastasized more frequently than adenocarcinomas (45% versus 35%, respectively).",

Mesenchymal tumors or tumors with a fibrous or scirrhous component may not exfoliate well, leading to a poorly cellular sample inadequate for diagnosis. Tissue imprints or smears of tissue scrapings taken from biopsy samples may improve cytologic diagnosis in these cases; however, imprints generally do not yield as good a sample for evaluation as aspirates (Baker and Lumsden, 1999). Also, mammary hyperplasia, dysplasia, benign tumors, and well-differentiated carcinomas tend to form a continuum of morphologic appearance, making cytologic differentiation of these lesions difficult (Benjamin et al., 1999). Lastly, the presence of stromal invasion, one of the most important criteria for determining the malignant potential of a mammary neoplasm, cannot be assessed by the cytologist. All of these factors can result in either false-positive or false-negative diagnosis of malignant mammary tumors using aspiration cytology.",

Allen et al (1986) reported cytologic sensitivities for detecting malignancies of 25% and 17% and specificities of 62% and 49% for the two cytopathologists involved in the study. Positive (PPV) and negative (NPV) predictive values were generally similar between the two pathologists, with PPVs of 90% and 100% and NPVs of 75% and 59% (Allen et al., 1986). The diagnostic accuracy was reported as 79% and 66%. In another study, the sensitivity for cytologic detection of mammary malignancies was found to be 65% with a specificity of 94% (Hellman and Lindgren, 1989). PPV was reported as 93%, NPV as 67%, and diagnostic accuracy as 79%. In a recent study, cytologic and histologic diagnostic agreement was 67.5%. However, when suspicious and insufficient/inadequate samples were excluded, a 92.9% agreement rate was obtained (Cassali et al., 2007). The same authors reported a sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of malignant tumors of 88.6% and 100%, respectively, and a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 88.6% for the diagnosis of benign lesions. Similar results were found in other studies (Simon et al., 2009, Sontas et al., 2012). FNA cytology of canine mammary tumors appears to be a valuable diagnostic tool, although lower accuracy exists when inadequate samples are taken into consideration (Sontas et al., 2012). The majority of these studies did not correlate cytologic diagnosis with disease-free intervals or survival times. Only one study reported that cytologic diagnosis appears to have a good correlation with duration of survival, recurrence-free interval, and metastasis-free interval (Simon et al., 2009). Therefore, the use of cytologic criteria to accurately predict the biologic behavior of MGT needs further investigation. Some studies demonstrated that cells in malignant epithelial mammary tumors had significantly more irregular nuclear shapes than did control epithelial cells or cells in benign tumors based on differences in fractal dimension and on nuclear diameter and roundness. These morphometric parameters could help in the preoperative cytologic evaluation of canine MGT (Simeonov and Simeonova, 2006a, Simeonov and Simeonova, 2006b).",

            "text": "Cytologic examination of mammary tumors frequently reveals a background containing variable amounts of blood, basophilic proteinaceous material, lipid, and foam cells. Aspirates of benign epithelial tumors (adenomas and ductal papillomas) typically reveal moderate to large numbers of epithelial cells arranged in sheets and clusters (Fig. 12-7\n). These cells are uniform in appearance with smooth nuclear chromatin and occasionally prominent, single, small, round nucleoli (Allison and Maddux, 2008). Acinar and palisading structures may be seen in samples from adenomas. Papillary and trabecular cell arrangement can be observed in other benign epithelial tumors (Masserdotti, 2006). Benign simple tumors may yield sheets and clusters of uniform-appearing epithelial cells, whereas benign complex tumors may yield a variable number of individualized or clumped spindle-shaped cells of myoepithelial origin is sometimes evident. Myoepithelial cells may also appear as oval free nuclei (Allison and Maddux, 2008). Examination of benign mixed mammary tumors may reveal the presence of cartilage or bone elements such as osteoblasts, osteoclasts, hematopoietic cells, and/or bright-pink extracellular material representative of osteoid or chondroid matrix (Fernandes et al., 1998) (Figure 12-8, Figure 12-9\n). Benign mixed mammary tumors can be difficult to diagnose using exfoliative cytology. For instance, the presence of spindle-shaped cells may not be sufficient for the diagnosis of complex or mixed tumors. Allen et al (1986) have noted that spindle cells were identified in the mammary tumors evaluated in their study, yet the presence of these cells did not correlate significantly with histologic classification of complex or mixed tumors. Aspirates of mixed tumors also may not reveal all of the cells comprising the tumor. In a case report, aspiration of a mammary mass in a dog revealed the presence of osteoblasts displaying moderate anisokaryosis and anisocytosis, osteoclasts, hematopoietic cells, and pink extracellular material (Fernandes et al., 1998). Another case featuring extramedullary hematopoiesis in a benign mixed mammary tumor in a dog contained cortical bone and marrow elements (Grandi et al., 2010). No epithelial cells were noted in the sample. Thus the multiple differentials included benign or malignant mixed mammary tumor, osseous metaplasia, and osteosarcoma. Histopathology confirmed that the neoplasm was a benign mixed mammary tumor.\n",

The epithelial cells are typically round, with round to oval, eccentrically located nuclei and moderate amounts of basophilic cytoplasm that may contain amorphous basophilic secretory product and/or clear vacuoles (Allison and Maddux, 2008) (Fig. 12-12). Some of these vacuoles may appear as punctate vacuoles of variable number or as a diffuse clearing of the cytoplasm that distends the cell and displaces the nucleus peripherally. Criteria of malignancy that may be seen in these cells include increased nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio; moderate to marked variation in nuclear and cell size; nuclear molding; large, prominent, multiple, and/or abnormally shaped nucleoli; and binucleation and multinucleation (Fig. 12-13A&C). Increased mitotic activity and abnormal mitotic figures may be present (Fig. 12-13B). Ductular carcinomas typically present with sheets and clusters of pleomorphic epithelial cells with high nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratios and round, basal nuclei. These cells usually display more than three malignant criteria. Acinar structures, secretory product, and cytoplasmic vacuoles are not characteristic features of ductular carcinomas. Papillary and trabecular cell arrangements can be observed in malignant epithelial tumors (Masserdotti, 2006).",

These cells tend to have bizarre nuclear and nucleolar forms. Multinucleation and abnormal mitotic figures are frequently seen. IMC, which are invasive and aggressive, fast growing, and a highly malignant form of mammary carcinoma, also present with large, pleomorphic epithelial cells exhibiting various criteria of malignancy (Lana et al., 2007). IMC affects humans and dogs and rarely cats (P\u00e9rez-Alenza et al., 2004) and is characterized by a fulminant clinical course, sudden presentation, edema, erythema, firmness, pain and warmth of the mammary glands, without primary IMC or with secondary IMC mammary nodules (Souza et al., 2009). Clinical signs may be present in one or both mammary chains. Associated clinical signs of inflammation may mimic mastitis and severe dermatitis. Histologically, several types of highly malignant mammary carcinomas have been described. The hallmark for the histologic confirmation of IMC is the invasion of dermal lymphatic vessels by neoplastic emboli. The blockage of the superficial lymphatics by tumor cells is responsible for the severe edema found in the region (Goldschmidt et al., 2011, Grandi et al., 2011, de M Souza CH et al., 2009). The most frequent cytologic findings are the presence of anaplastic epithelial cells, singly or in small clusters. Therefore the cytologic findings of highly malignant mammary epithelial cells in association with clinical signs of edema, warmth, pain, and erythema support a differential diagnosis of IMC (Solano-Gallego et al., 2011). This clinical entity has a guarded prognosis with a short survival time (Marconato et al., 2009), but medical treatment with piroxicam seems to improve clinical outcome and prolonged survival time (Souza et al., 2009).",

However, the presence of either population or predominance of one cell type over the other may depend on the area of tumor aspirated (Allison and Maddux, 2008). In malignant mixed mammary tumors, there are malignant epithelial cells and sometimes also benign-appearing myoepithelial cells with variable amount of osteoid or chondroid matrix, whereas in carcinosarcomas, both epithelial and mesenchymal populations should display malignant features. Mammary sarcomas, such as osteosarcoma, fibrosarcoma, and liposarcoma, are of similar cytologic appearance to those found in other body sites. Sarcomas tend to exfoliate poorly, often resulting in samples of low cellularity. Depending on the type of tumor, pink extracellular material or lipid may be present in the background. In general, sarcomas are characterized by spindle-shaped to irregular cells arranged individually and in small clumps. The cytoplasm of these cells is moderately to deeply basophilic, and the cytoplasmic borders tend to be indistinct. The cells display cytologic features of malignancy similar to those described for epithelial neoplasms.",

Intact females have an almost sevenfold greater risk of developing mammary neoplasms as compared to neutered females, and ovariohysterectomy has been reported to decrease the risk of MGT to 0.6% compared to intact females (Hayes et al., 1981). Regular, but not irregular, administration of exogenous progesterone was associated with a significantly increased risk of benign mammary tumors and mammary carcinomas in cats (Misdorp, 1991). Hormone receptor analysis has shown that normal feline mammary tissue contains estrogen and progesterone receptors in levels similar to those found in the dog (Millanta et al., 2005). However, unlike canine MGT but similar to humans, most feline mammary neoplasms express very low levels of estrogen and progesterone receptors, which may be related to the high rate of malignancy found with mammary neoplasia in the cat (Burrai et al., 2010). Other molecular targets have been investigated to elucidate prognosis, the pathways of tumorigenesis or metastasis such as cyclin A, Cox-2 (Millanta et al., 2006b), HER2, VEGF, E-cadherin \u03b2-catenin (Lana et al., 2007, Zappulli et al., 2012), CXCR4 (Ferrari et al., 2012), matrix metalloproteinase (Akkoc et al., 2012), and AKT (Maniscalco et al., 2012).",

Moreover, the majority of feline mammary tumors are of simple type with rare myoepithelial component. Adenocarcinomas are the most prevalent malignant mammary tumor followed by carcinomas and sarcomas (MacEwen et al., 1984). Secondary or postsurgical IMC (Millanta et al., 2012, P\u00e9rez-Alenza et al., 2004) and lipid-rich carcinoma (Kamstock et al., 2005) have been described, for the first time, in cats. Malignant MGT in cats tend to grow rapidly and metastasize to regional lymph nodes, lung, pleura, liver, diaphragm, adrenal glands, and kidneys (Lana et al., 2007). The single most important prognostic indicator for feline MGT is tumor size at the time of diagnosis. Median survival time for cats with mammary tumors greater than 3 cm, between 2 and 3 cm, and less than 2 cm is 6 months, 2 years, and greater than 3 years, respectively (MacEwen et al., 1984). Thus early diagnosis and treatment is very important for feline mammary malignancies.",

            "text": "Treatment considerations will follow clinical and cytologic and/or histologic identification of a mammary neoplasm in a dog or a cat. If a malignancy is present, staging the extent of the disease should include three-view thoracic radiographs or CT scan of the lungs and any other potential metastatic sites as well as cytologic analysis of regional lymph nodes, suspected metastatic lesions, and/or body cavity effusions. It has been proposed that treatment guidelines for malignant canine MGT be based on tumor size, histopathologic type, and differentiation (Sorenmo, 2003). Surgical excision is the treatment of choice for both canine and feline mammary neoplasms (Gim\u00e9nez et al., 2010). In dogs, it is recommended to perform ovariohysterectomy if intact in all malignant canine MGT and to institute chemotherapy in an undifferentiated carcinoma in stage I (Sorenmo, 2003). There is limited information regarding the efficacy of adjuvant therapy involving chemotherapeutics, radiation, or immune stimulation in canine and feline mammary malignancies. However, the combination of surgery and adjunctive doxorubicin chemotherapy resulted in improved long-term survival in cats with mammary gland adenocarcinoma, but controls were not studied (Novosad, 2003, Novosad et al., 2006). In contrast, a cohort study did not find benefit of adjuvant doxorubricin-based chemotherapy (McNeill et al., 2009). In addition, the combination of surgery and adjunctive 5-fluorouracil and cyclophosphamide chemotherapy demonstrated significant survival improvement in dogs with mammary gland carcinomas stage III/IV when compared with surgery alone (Karayannopoulo et al., 2001). In contrast, chemotherapy did not lead to an improved outcome in dogs with invasive malignant MGT (Simon et al., 2006). The use of antiestrogens, such as tamoxifen, has been documented in a small number of clinical cases, with somewhat conflicting results in regard to tumor response. These drugs can be associated with undesirable estrogen-related side effects (Novosad, 2003).",

Each ovary lies within an ovarian bursa, an extension of the mesosalpinx, which is a fold of the peritoneum. Cuboidal epithelium called germinal epithelium covers the cortex of the ovary, and a layer of dense connective tissue, the tunica albuginea, is present underneath the epithelium. The canine ovary has small ingrowths of the ovarian surface that are called subsurface epithelial structures. The cortex of the ovary contains follicles, stromal connective tissue, and blood vessels. The ova develop in follicles that are of four types: primordial, primary, secondary, and tertiary. Each developing follicle has the oocyte, multiple layers of granulosa cells, and more peripheral thecal connective tissue cells (Fig. 12-15\n). Ovulation occurs when the follicle ruptures, releasing the ovum and allowing the space to fill with blood and luteal cells to form the corpus hemorrhagicum and the corpus luteum, respectively. In bitches and queens, cords of epithelial cells called interstitial glands, which are cells of an endocrine type, occur throughout the stroma. A medulla consisting of richly vascularized loose connective tissue, lymphatics, and nerves lies internal to the ovarian cortex. Channels lined by cuboidal epithelium called rete ovarii are present in this region (Foster, 2007).",

In the dog, granulosa cell tumors account for 50% of ovarian tumors and occur in elderly bitches with a median age of 10 to 12 years. Seventy-seven percent of granulosa cell tumors produce estrogens and/or progesterone, and up to 20% are malignant. Granulosa cell tumor is the most common sex cord\u2013stromal tumor in older cats, and more than 50% are malignant. Reported metastatic sites include the peritoneum, lumbar lymph nodes, omentum, diaphragm, kidney, pancreas, spleen, liver, and lungs (McEntee, 2002). Granulosa cell tumors may be confused sometimes with ovarian epithelial tumors even in histologic preparations. Useful immunohistochemical markers to distinguish these two tumors are cytokeratin 7 and inhibin-\u03b1. Ovarian epithelial tumors cells are positive to cytokeratin 7 and negative to inhibin-\u03b1, whereas granulosa tumor cells and thecomas are negative to cytokeratin 7 and positive to inhibin-\u03b1 (Klein, 2007, Riccardi et al., 2007). Another marker useful to differentiate granulosa cell tumors from ovarian epithelial tumors is Hector Battifora mesothelial epitope-1 (HBME-1). HBME-1 is one of the immunohistochemical markers employed in the diagnosis of ovarian epithelial tumors. Granulosa cells and related tumors are consistently negative for HBME-1 (Banco et al., 2011).",

It is supported by a mesosalpinx. The mesosalpinx of the dog completely surrounds the ovary and has a large amount of fat; a small hole connects the bursa to the abdominal cavity. The infundibulum surrounds the ovary. The wall of the uterus has three layers: outer perimetrium (serosa), middle myometrium, and inner endometrium (mucosa) (Fig. 12-34A-C\n). The perimetrium is composed of loose connective tissue and covered by peritoneal mesothelium. The myometrium is divided into a thick, inner circular layer and a thin, outer longitudinal layer (Fig. 12-34A). A richly vascularized and well-innervated stratum vasculare usually separates the muscle layers (Fig. 12-34C). The epithelium of the endometrium is simple cuboidal or columnar in the bitch and queen depending of the estrus cycle. Simple, branched endometrial glands extend into the lamina propria (Fig. 12-34B). The cervix is the structure that separates the external genitalia from the uterus and is an effective barrier from the external environment. The cervix does not have transverse folds and tends to open dorsally (Foster, 2007). The normal histology of the uterus from immature female dogs and sequential microscopic changes that occur during different stages of the estrous cycle are reviewed elsewhere (Rehm et al., 2007).",

The common presentation of pyometra involves older, unbred bitches presenting from 4 weeks to 4 months following estrus with mild to severe evidence of systemic illness (Smith, 2006). Clinical signs may include anorexia, depression, polyuria, and/or polydipsia and abdominal distention with or without vaginal discharge (open- and closed-cervix pyometra, respectively). Typically, the bitch is afebrile and will often have leukocytosis, although leukopenia is also, less commonly, reported. Prerenal azotemia commonly accompanies dehydration. This systemic disease may result in death due to toxemia, renal disease, and peritonitis. There is an increased risk of pyometra in some breeds.",

Most commonly, a saline-moistened cotton swab or thin glass rod with a rounded tip is directed craniodorsally into the caudal vagina. The vestibule and clitoral fossa should be avoided since keratinized superficial squamous cells present in these sites may alter cytologic interpretations. Once craniad to the urethral orifice, vaginal cells are obtained by gently passing the swab or glass rod over the epithelial lining (Root Kustritz, 2006). In an alternate method of sample collection, a small glass bulb pipette containing sterile saline is passed into the caudal vagina and cells are obtained by repeatedly flushing and aspirating the saline fluid (Olson et al., 1984a). Once collected, the exfoliated cells are gently transferred onto a clean microscope slide for staining. In addition, endoscopic vaginoscopy is a useful diagnostic procedure for evaluating the nature and extent of disease in the vestibule and vagina and for obtaining adequate samples for microscopic evaluation. The technique is reviewed in depth elsewhere (Lulich, 2006).",

            "text": "Although several types of stains have been used for cytologic evaluation of vaginal cells, ones such as methanolic or aqueous Romanowsky stains are most commonly used. These stains are easy to use in a clinical setting and provide good morphologic detail for determining the degree of maturation of the epithelial cells. Papanicolaou or trichrome stains have also been used for estrous cycle staging. These stains impart a distinctive orange staining to the keratin precursors that are abundant in superficial cells. The ratio of orange or eosinophilic cells to noneosinophilic cells, termed the eosinophilic index, can be used to assess the degree of maturation of the epithelial cells and subsequently stage the estrous cycle. However, these stains may yield variable staining results, and the need for multiple solutions limits their practical use. However, an ultrafast modified Papanicolaou stain seems to be a useful technique in the study of vaginal cytology as a tool for assessing the estrous cycle in the bitch (Perez et al., 2005). Indications for vaginal culture include any disorder of the genitourinary tract associated with vulvar discharge and anterior vaginal culture in proestrus for the diagnosis of uterine infection (Root Kustritz, 2006). The vagina is not sterile, and larger numbers of normal flora are routinely cultured from the caudal vagina than the cranial vagina and during estrus than diestrus or anestrus. However, a larger number of organisms are retrieved from bitches with reproductive tract disease than from normal bitches. It is important to provide a quantitative culture result due to the fact that reproductive tract infection is caused by overgrowth of normal flora.",

Although the mucosa is typically nonglandular, intraepithelial glands have been observed during estrus in the dog. The vulva is anatomically similar to the caudal vagina. The vulva is composed of the vestibule containing the urethral orifice, clitoral fossa, and labia. The mucosa is lined by stratified squamous epithelium; some keratinized epithelial cells may be found in the vestibule and clitoral fossa (Allison et al., 2008). Vestibular glands within the submucosal layer of the vestibule are responsible for mucus production, which is most notable during estrus and at parturition (Banks, 1986).

Although vaginal cytology has been shown to be a more accurate indicator of estrus (Fig. 12-38\n) and, subsequently, ovulation than behavioral signs, evidence of vaginal maturation or cornification is not closely associated with ovulation. Maximum cornification of vaginal superficial cells ranges from 6 days before the luteinizing hormone (LH) peak to 3 days after the LH peak (Olson et al., 1984a). Since ovulation usually occurs 1 to 2 days after the LH peak, vaginal cytology is not an accurate predictor of ovulation. Ova are viable for up to 2 days postovulation, and sperm may remain viable for up to 4 days within the canine reproductive tract during estrus. Therefore, bitches should be bred every 2 to 3 days during cytologic estrus (greater than 90% superficial cells) for optimal breeding (Freshman, 1991). Use of plasma progesterone concentrations in combination with vaginal cytology more accurately indicates the time of ovulation, allowing for even greater breeding efficiency and more accurate estimation of the time of expected parturition (Wright, 1990).",

Neutrophils frequently reappear during diestrus, frequently localized into the cytoplasm of epithelial cells (metaestrum cells).

The presenting clinical sign generally is a slow-growing perineal mass. Clinical signs seen less frequently include vulvar bleeding or discharge, an enlarging vulvar mass, dysuria, hematuria, tenesmus, excessive vulvar licking, and dystocia (Klein, 2007). Leiomyomas, fibroleiomyomas, fibromas, and fibroepithelial polyps (Brown et al., 2012) are the most common vaginal neoplasm in dogs and cats (Baker and Lumsden, 1999). Lipoleiomyomas are also rarely reported (Sycamore and Julian, 2011). These benign mesenchymal tumors are characterized by variable numbers of spindle-shaped cells of uniform size and shape arranged individually and in small clumps (Fig. 12-45\n). The nuclei are typically oval, and scant to moderate amounts of wispy cytoplasm are present. The most common malignant tumor is leiomyosarcoma, and distant metastasis has been reported (Brodey and Roszel, 1967). Other tumors with malignant potential include transmissible venereal tumors (TVT), adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma/epidermoid carcinoma, urethral transitional cell carcinoma, osteosarcoma, hemangiosarcoma, rhabdomyosarcoma, lymphoma, and mast cell tumor (Klein, 2007). The cytologic appearance of these tumors is similar to those found in other body sites. Treatment of vaginal tumors usually involves conservative surgical excision combined with ovariohysterectomy, which is usually is curative for benign tumors (Klein, 2007). In cases of malignant tumors, further evaluation to determine extent of local invasion or metastasis should be performed.",

The tumors may be located in genital areas and extragenital sites such as the rectum, skin, oral and nasal cavities, and eyes (Lorimier and Fan, 2007). They appear as firm, friable, tan, ulcerated, and nodular or polypoid masses (Fig. 12-46\n). In bitches, TVT may spread directly to the cervix, uterus, and oviducts. Although metastasis is uncommon, TVT can spread to regional lymph nodes, skin, and subcutaneous tissue. Other reported metastatic sites include lips, oral mucous membranes, eye, bone, musculature, abdominal viscera, lungs, and central nervous system (Park et al., 2006). TVT is suspected to be of histiocytic origin based on positive reactions to lysozyme, alpha-1-antitripsin, vimentin, and a macrophage-specific immunostain and negative reaction to immunostains specific for other cell types. Recently described is TVT with intracellular Leishmania infantum amastigotes, which also suggests a histiocytic origin (Lorimier and Fan, 2007).",

Ejaculate material for the evaluation of prostatic disease can be obtained from intact dogs via manual stimulation; however, collection of semen may not be possible if the dog is inexperienced or in pain (Dorfman and Barsanti, 1995). A collection funnel may be used to separate the clear prostatic third fraction of the ejaculate from the sperm-rich first and second fractions (Olson et al., 1987). An aliquot for microbiologic analysis should be placed into a sterile culture tube with the remaining fluid retained for cytologic evaluation. If inflammation is suspected, the cytologic aliquot should be placed into a vial containing ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) (Baker and Lumsden, 1999). Because of the presence of normal bacterial flora in the lower urethra, a quantitative culture should be performed on the ejaculate fluid. In the presence of inflammatory cells, high numbers (>100,000 cfu/mL) of gram-negative or gram-positive bacteria indicate an infectious process (Root Kustritz, 2006). If cytologic and microbiologic results are equivocal in regards to prostatic infection versus urethral contamination, a quantitative lower urethral culture to compare to the semen culture results may be useful (Dorfman and Barsanti, 1995).",

            "text": "Prostatic massage is used primarily to collect prostatic fluid in dogs unable to ejaculate (Dorfman and Barsanti, 1995). The simplest method for prostatic massage or wash involves passing a urinary catheter, guided by rectal palpation, to the caudal pole of the prostate. A syringe is attached to the catheter and fluid is aspirated as the prostate is gently massaged per rectum (Olson et al., 1987). A few milliliters of sterile saline may be flushed into the catheter and aspirated to facilitate collection of fluid for analysis. Urinary tract infection often accompanies infectious prostatitis, which may confound the results of prostatic massage. For these cases, an alternative massage procedure may be used to determine the source of the infection. The urinary bladder is catheterized, emptied of urine, and flushed with 5 mL of sterile physiologic saline. The fluid from this first flush is collected as the preprostatic massage fraction. The catheter is then retracted to the caudal pole of the prostate. Another 5 mL of sterile physiologic saline is injected through the catheter while the prostate is massaged per rectum. The catheter is then advanced back into the bladder, and all the fluid in the bladder is collected. This fluid is the postprostatic massage fraction, which should be relatively free of urinary contamination (Root Kustritz MV, 2006, Smith, 2008). Bacterial colony counts and presence or absence of inflammatory cells from the pre- and postprostatic massage fractions can be compared to isolate the source of the infection. Ampicillin, which concentrates in urine but reaches lower concentrations in the prostate owing to its inability to cross the prostatic-lipid barrier, may be administered 1 day prior to prostatic massage to aid in isolation of the source of infection. In general, prostatic massage should be reserved for evaluation of prostatitis in dogs without urinary tract infection or in which the urinary tract infection is controlled.

Dogs with suspected prostatic disease presenting with an inflammatory leukogram and fever should not undergo FNA. If purulent fluid is obtained during aspiration of the prostate, aspiration should continue until all pressure is reduced to prevent leakage of the material (Baker and Lumsden, 1999). However, there are reports in the veterinary literature documenting FNA for diagnosis or treatment of prostatic disease with no complications (Boland et al., 2003). Ultrasound-guided transabdominal FNA of the prostate is described elsewhere (Root Kustritz, 2006). FNA of the prostate has several advantages over other collection methods. Identification of squamous epithelial cells from a prostatic aspirate allows the diagnosis of squamous metaplasia, whereas the presence of these cells in prostatic massage fluid could be misinterpreted as normal lower urinary tract squamous epithelial cells. Also, the greater cellular detail obtained via FNA increases the confidence of a diagnosis of neoplasia. The primary disadvantage of prostatic FNA is that focal lesions, such as neoplasia, may be missed (Thrall et al., 1985). However, use of ultrasound to guide the aspirate can lessen this possibility. Prostatic biopsy is described elsewhere (Smith, 2008).",

Prostatic epithelial cells obtained via aspiration from normal dogs occur in frequent clusters and are cuboidal to columnar. These cells are uniform in size and shape and contain round to oval nuclei, which may be basilar in columnar cells. Nucleoli are usually small and inconspicuous. The cytoplasm is finely granular or microvacuolated and basophilic (Thrall et al., 1985). Other cell types that may be seen, particularly from semen samples or prostatic massages, include spermatozoa, squamous epithelial cells, and transitional epithelial cells (urothelial cells) (Zinkl, 2008). Spermatozoa stain blue-green with Romanowsky and modified Romanowsky stains and may adhere to other cells. Squamous cells are large with abundant amounts of blue to blue-green (keratinized) cytoplasm. The nuclei of these cells may be round to pyknotic or absent. Cell borders are typically angular to folded. Transitional cells (urothelial cells) are larger than prostatic epithelial cells and have lighter-staining cytoplasm with a lower nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio. Normal ejaculate fluid may contain low numbers of neutrophils and red blood cells. Use of excessive amounts of ultrasound gel during ultrasound-guided FNA can result in large amounts of purple, variably sized, granular background debris that may obscure cellular detail (Zinkl, 2008). To prevent this artifact, excess gel should be removed before inserting the aspiration needle.",

Prostatic cysts (see Fig. 2-6) may occur as multiple, small cysts associated with androgen-dependent benign hyperplasia as well as large retention cysts within the prostate tissue. Paraprostatic cysts may become mineralized or result from osseus metaplasia. Except for hyperplasia-associated cysts, prostatic cysts account for 2% to 5% of prostatic abnormalities (Dorfman and Barsanti, 1995). Another study reported a prevalence of 14% prostatic cysts in adult, large-breed dogs without genitourinary system problems, and bacterial cultures of prostatic cysts were positive in 42% of cases (Black et al., 1998). Prostatic cavitary lesions containing urine (urinary cysts) due to intraprostatic urethral fistulation have been reported (Bokemeyer et al., 2011). Small cysts may be palpated per rectum as small, fluctuant areas in an asymmetrically enlarged prostate. Large, discrete cysts may be palpated in the caudal abdomen or in the perineal area. Unless the cyst(s) become secondarily infected, clinical signs are uncommon (Olson et al., 1987). A bloody urethral discharge, dysuria, and tenesmus may be present owing to increased prostatic size. Recommended treatment is surgical resection, with or without concurrent castration (Johnston et al., 2000). Ultrasound-guided, percutaneous drainage of prostatic cysts appears to be a useful alternative treatment (Boland et al., 2003).",

BPH is increase in gland size and weight related to increases in interstitial tissue and gland lumens (Lowseth et al., 1990). Symmetrical cystic dilation of the glands results from increases in the interstitium and gland lumens. The pathogenesis of BPH is not completely understood. However, its development is hormonally dependent and requires the presence of functioning testes (Dorfman and Barsanti, 1995). Dihydrotestosterone is accepted as a key hormone in stimulating enlargement of the canine prostate by enhancing growth in both stromal and glandular components (Johnston et al., 2000). Circulating levels of testosterone are often decreased in older male dogs; however, dihydrotestosterone concentrations are often increased in the hyperplastic tissue (Olson et al., 1987). Nuclear androgen receptor expression is increased in hyperplastic tissue of older Beagles, suggesting increased tissue sensitivity to circulating androgens. Additionally, estrogens appear to act synergistically with androgens in potentiating BPH and may also act directly on the prostate, resulting in stromal hypertrophy and squamous epithelial metaplasia. The treatment of choice for canine BPH is castration or finasteride administration\u2014finasteride inhibits conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone, causing prostatic involution via apoptosis (Sirinarumitr et al., 2001). Other medical options exist for treating BPH and are reviewed elsewhere (Smith, 2008).",

Estrogen receptors, which are present on ductal, stromal, and 10% of the prostatic epithelial cells, may mediate this responsiveness (Baker and Lumsden, 1999). Although chronic irritation and inflammation can result in squamous metaplasia, the most common endogenous source of estrogen is Sertoli cell tumors (Powe et al., 2004). The prostate may be small as a result of decreased concentrations of testosterone or enlarged if cysts or abscessation is present. Clinical signs usually relate to hyperestrogenism.

Hematogenous and local spread from other urogenital organs is also possible (Dorfman and Barsanti, 1995). Escherichia coli is the most commonly isolated organism from both acute and chronic cases of prostatitis followed by Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella spp., Proteus mirabilis, Mycoplasma canis, Pseudomona aeruginosa, Enterobacter spp., Streptococcus spp., Pasteurella spp., and Haemophilus spp. (Johnston et al., 2000, Smith, 2008). Brucella canis may infect the canine prostate, but it is more commonly associated with epididymal and testicular infection and clinical signs referable to those organs (Johnston et al., 2000). Anaerobic bacteria or fungal infections (Blastomyces dermatitidis [Fig. 12-55\n] [Reed et al., 2010], Cryptococcus neoformans, or Coccidioides immitis) also have been observed via hematogenous spread, urethral ascent, or penetration through the scrotum with descending prostate infection from a testicular source (Johnston et al., 2000). Infertility and chronic prostatitis due to Leishmania infantum infection have been reported (Mir et al., 2012). Alteration of normal architecture by diseases such as BPH, squamous metaplasia, and neoplasia can interfere with normal defense mechanisms or provide a medium (i.e., blood in cysts) for bacterial growth (Olson et al., 1987). Coalescing of focal areas of septic prostatitis or infection of prostatic cysts may result in prostatic abscessation (Baker and Lumsden, 1999).",

The dog may also experience locomotor problems due to caudal lumbar or abdominal pain. An inflammatory leukogram with or without a left-shift is often present. Clinical signs in dogs with chronic prostatitis may be absent, or there may be recurrent urinary tract infection, poor semen quality with infertility, or sometimes decreased libido (Johnston et al., 2000). Intermittent or constant urethral discharge may also be noted. Prostatic abscesses may present with signs related to enlargement of the prostate (tenesmus, dysuria), constant or intermittent urethral discharge, and evidence of systemic illness related to endotoxemia or peritonitis. Treatment of prostatitis involves appropriate antibiotic therapy as determined by culture and sensitivity. In acute prostatitis, most antibiotics will reach the site of infection because the prostate-lipid barrier is disrupted (Olson et al., 1987). Antibiotics for the treatment of chronic prostatitis should be selected for the ability to cross the lipid barrier, which is usually intact, and for the ability to concentrate in the prostate. In addition to appropriate antibiotic therapy, prostatic abscesses can be treated surgically with marsupialization of the gland, placement of a drain, or prostatectomy. All of these surgical procedures are associated with significant complications. Castration should also be performed in dogs with prostatitis (Dorfman and Barsanti, 1995).",

            "text": "Potentially, these neoplasms could originate from prostatic acinar epithelium, urothelium lining the prostatic urethra (e.g., transitional cell carcinoma), or ductal epithelium. Histologically, most canine prostatic carcinomas are of an intraalveolar pattern but many also contain patterns similar to transitional cell carcinoma. In humans, prostate-specific antigen (PSA) distinguishes between prostatic carcinoma and urothelial (transitional cell) carcinoma. However, dog prostate cells do not produce PSA as in humans but rather a related kallikrein family enzyme, arginine esterase, for which there is no commercially available antibody. In addition, keratin 7 immunoreactivity and arginine esterase gene expression and enzyme activity do not distinguish canine transitional cell carcinomas from prostate carcinomas-glandular type (LeRoy et al., 2004). Currently, a ductal epithelium origin of prostatic carcinomas is supported, related to the fact that prostatic carcinomas often have acinar and urothelial morphologies involving the prostate gland and the bladder. In addition, embryonic urogenital sinus epitelium gives rise to the prostate gland and the bladder and, therefore, canine prostatic carcinoma might originate from a ductal epithelial cell capable of bimodal differentiation along both urothelial and prostatic acinar cell lines (Leroy and Northrup, 2009). Moreover, in another study, the expression of uroplakin III (UPIII), PSA, CK7, and CK18 indicates that canine prostatic carcinoma most likely originates from the collecting ducts rather than from the peripheral acini (Lai et al., 2008). Canine prostatic carcinomas are predominantly androgen receptor\u2013negative, suggesting that androgens may not be required for initiation or progression of this tumor (Fan and de Lorimier, 2007). Comparative features of human and canine prostatic carcinoma are reviewed elsewhere (Leroy and Northrup, 2009).",

This chemopreventive effect may be partially mediated through the inhibition of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) activity causing the blockade of endogenous prostaglandin E2 production (Fan and de Lorimier, 2007). Canine normal prostatic tissues have failed to express COX-2, but it was detected in 75% to 88% of prostatic carcinomas (L\u2019Eplattenier et al., 2007).

Cytologic evaluation of FNA samples from prostatic carcinoma (glandular type) usually reveals large numbers of deeply basophilic, frequently vacuolated, epithelial cells arranged in variably sized clusters and sheets (Fig. 12-58A&B\n). The nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratio is often high, and anisokaryosis and anisocytosis can be moderate to marked. Nuclei are round to pleomorphic, and nucleoli are large, prominent, and often multiple. Binucleation may be noted. Glandular type prostatic carcinoma and transitional type can be difficult to distinguish cytologically and histopathologically (Baker and Lumsden, 1999). Some acinar structures may be noted in glandular type, which can help to differentiate this neoplasm from transitional type carcinoma (Zinkl, 2008). Moreover, the transitional cells show tailed shapes and only sporadically exhibit vacuolated cytoplasm, as consequences of glandular metaplasia. Neoplastic cells are arranged in discohesive, mostly bidimensional clusters. Nuclei are round to ovoid, with irregularly clumped chromatin, sometimes nucleolated and show moderate to marked anisokaryosis (Figure 12-59, Figure 12-60, Figure 12-61, Figure 12-62\n). Neoplastic canine prostate glands also frequently contain foci of BPH, cystic glandular dilatation, and significant suppurative and lymphoplasmacytic inflammation. Bell et al (1991) reported that a diagnosis of neoplasia was established in 15 of 19 (79%) of samples submitted for cytologic analysis from dogs with histologically confirmed prostatic carcinoma. False-negative cytology results could have been related to small sample size, focal distribution of neoplastic lesions, or concurrent prostatitis and/or BPH. Serum and seminal plasma concentrations of acid phosphatase, PSA, and canine prostate specific esterase have not been shown to be useful in the definitive diagnosis of canine prostatic carcinoma (Gobello et al., 2002).",

The material should be very lightly smeared when preparing the cell monolayer. Alternatively, gentle touch imprints from available tissue may decrease cellular disruption (Baker and Lumsden, 1999).

Presence of multinucleated cells is possible, as the result of cytodieresis imperfecta, a morphologic expression of incomplete separation of germinal cells during subdivision. Mitotic activity is often high. More mature stages of developing sperm are characterized by oval, eosinophilic to pale-staining nuclei, and tails may be noted. Small groups of columnar cells, with indistinct cytoplasm and large round nuclei as single nucleoli, recognizable as Sertoli cells, can be evident. Scattered stellate or caudate Leydig cells, with microvacuolated cytoplasm, sometimes with bluish granules of lipofuscin pigment and round nuclei are sometimes observed (Masserdotti et al., 2005).",

Intranuclear or intracytoplasmic inclusions may be seen in cases of distemper-associated orchitis (Ladds, 1993). Orchitis may also be associated with infection by the dimorphic yeast, Blastomyces dermatitidis. Orchitis has been recently reported in two dogs with Rocky Mountain spotted fever (Ober et al., 2004). Chronic purulent epididymitis associated with Mycoplasma canis infection has been described in one dog (L\u2019Abee-Lund et al., 2003). In cats, orchitis or epididymitis is uncommon and orchitis has been associated with coronavirus infection in one cat (Sigurdardottir et al., 2001) and the isolation of Sporothrix schenckii from a testis in another cat (Schubach et al., 2002). Acute orchitis is characterized by a predominance of neutrophils, some of which may exhibit nuclear degenerative changes. Macrophages, including multinucleated giant cells and lymphocytes, may be seen in chronic inflammatory disease or fungal (blastomycosis) or protozoal (such as Leishmania infantum [Diniz et al., 2005]) infections.",

This tumor has been associated with increased production of testosterone and a high prevalence of prostatic disease and perianal gland neoplasms (McEntee, 2002). Interstitial cell tumors, but not Sertoli cell tumors or seminoma, produce inhibins and 3\u03b2-hydroxsteroid dehydrogenases, which allows discrimination of interstitial cell tumors from other tumors of the canine testes (Taniyama et al., 2001). Cytologic samples from interstitial cell tumors are of variable cellularity. The cells are round or spindle-shaped and usually contain abundant amounts of lightly to moderately basophilic cytoplasm (Fig. 12-72\n). Perivascular arrangement (Fig. 12-73\n) is commonly seen (Masserdotti, 2006). The nuclei are round to oval with fine, reticular chromatin and small, prominent nucleoli. The presence of nuclear pseudoinclusions is observed in half of the cases. Moderate to marked anisokaryosis and variable nuclear-to-cytoplasmic ratios are seen. Numerous small, uniform cytoplasmic clear vacuoles are common (Fig. 12-72). Dark, irregularly shaped cytoplasmic granules may be present in some cells (Zinkl, 2008, Masserdotti et al., 2005).",

However, the cytologist is occasionally presented with seminal material from dogs or cats with infertility or suspected testicular or prostatic disease; thus the ability to recognize certain abnormalities is useful. Gross evaluation, pH and light microscopy such as concentration, motility, and morphology are routinely used to evaluate the principal parameters of dog and cat semen. Concentration is usually determined using a counting chamber. Aqueous Romanowsky or methanolic-Romanowsky stains are often used to assess sperm morphology. In high-quality semen, nearly all of the sperm should be of similar morphology. Spermatozoal abnormalities are considered as primary or secondary and described in Table 12-2\n. Primary abnormalities occur mostly during defective spermatogenesis and are therefore more serious. Secondary abnormalities may occur during passage through the epididymis (defective maturation) or during collection and preparation of the slide (Table 12-2). Severe abnormalities include abnormal size or shape of the sperm head or acrosomal cap, proximal or midpiece protoplasmic droplets, and coiled tails (Figure 12-74, Figure 12-75, Figure 12-76\n). Less severe abnormalities include detached, normal-appearing heads and bent tails (Figure 12-76, Figure 12-77\n). Normal semen samples should have less than 10% and 20% of primary and secondary abnormalities, respectively. Total canine and feline spermatozoal abnormalities should be less than 20% to 30% (Freshman, 2002).",

Normal cytology of the sperm-rich fraction contains spermatozoa, white blood cells (WBC; 2 to 4/HPF), epithelial cells, bacteria, and red blood cells. Increased or degenerate neutrophils or macrophages or intracellular bacteria indicate inflammation and/or infection (Figure 12-77, Figure 12-78\n). If neutrophils exhibit degenerative changes, a search for infectious organisms should be performed. However, culture of the fluid may be necessary for identification of pathogens due to the fact that 55% of clinically meaningful aerobic, anaerobic, or myoplasmic bacterial growth has noninflammatory seminal fluid cytology (Root Kustritz et al., 2005). Normal cytology of prostatic fluid is characterized by small amounts of epithelial cells, bacteria, and WBC (2 to 4/HPF) (Freshman, 2002). Lower urinary tract inflammation and/or prostatitis should also be considered when inflammatory cells are present in semen. The presence of abnormal prostatic epithelium in the semen sample warrants further evaluation of the prostate gland (Zinkl, 2008).\n",

The most often used seminal markers are alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and carnitine. Both components originate from the epididymis in the dog and have the same application as markers of patency of ductal azoospermia. In an azoospermic semen sample, measurement of ALP or carnitine activity is essential in determining if the azoospermia is due to problems with libido, testicular failure, or ductal blockage. A low ALP or carnitine activity indicates ductal blockage, whereas a normal ALP or carnitine activity indicates testicular failure (Gobello et al., 2002, Freshman, 2002).",
