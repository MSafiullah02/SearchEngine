            "text": "Astroviruses are small, nonenveloped, positive-sense RNA viruses with a genome size of 6.8 to 7.9 kb. On the basis of their distinctive star-like structure, the name astrovirus was given to these small round viruses, which are known to cause diarrhea in humans and domestic poultry (Madeley and Cosgrove, 1975). The duck hepatitis virus, which was thought to be a picornavirus (Asplin, 1965), was later renamed as an astrovirus on the basis of its morphology (Gough et al., 1984). Turkey astrovirus (TAstV) was first detected in turkey poults experiencing diarrhea in the United Kingdom (McNulty et al., 1980), and later in the United States (Reynolds and Saif, 1986). Three types of avian astroviruses have been detected in turkeys, 2 of turkey origin and 1 of chicken origin (Day et al., 2007; Pantin-Jackwood et al., 2008a). The turkey-origin viruses are known as turkey astrovirus 1 (TAstV-1) and turkey astrovirus 2 (TAstV-2) (Koci and Schultz-Cherry, 2002), and the chicken-origin virus is called avian nephritis virus (ANV). The prevalence of TAstV-2, TAstV-1, and ANV in commercial turkey flocks approaches 100, 15.4, and 12.5%, respectively (Pantin-Jackwood et al., 2008a). The TAstV-2 has frequently been associated with poult enteritis complex (PEC), poult enteritis mortality syndrome, and poult enteritis syndrome (PES; Barnes et al., 2000; Pantin-Jackwood et al., 2008a; Jindal et al., 2009a, 2010a).",

Another 20 birds were selected from an apparently healthy flock (non-PES flock). The birds were killed by cervical dislocation and then necropsied. The intestinal contents from the 2 groups were each pooled separately and processed as described earlier (Jindal et al., 2009b). Briefly, 10% suspensions of pooled intestinal contents in PBS were centrifuged at 1,200 \u00d7 g for 20 min at 25\u00b0C. The supernatants were collected and examined for bacteria (Salmonella) by culturing; they were found to be negative. We also tested the supernatants for rotavirus, reovirus, and coronavirus with reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR (Jindal et al., 2009c) to ensure that they were only positive for TAstV-2. The position of the bands on the agarose gel at 598, 630, 849, and 1,120 bp was used to confirm the presence or absence of coronavirus, rotavirus, TAstV-2, and reovirus, respectively. To further confirm viral identity, positive PCR products were purified using a QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and sequenced at the Biomedical Genomic Center (University of Minnesota, St. Paul). Sequencing was performed in both directions with the same primers as in the initial RT-PCR reactions. The sequences obtained were aligned with the existing database using the BLAST search tool available online (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov).",

Two birds from each of the 3 groups were killed at 1 d of age and their intestinal contents were examined by RT-PCR to ensure that they were free of enteric viruses, including TAstV. In addition, 1 pool of feces from the floor of each transport container was collected and examined by RT-PCR. The 3 groups of birds were placed into 3 separate isolators, and they were fed a starter diet from d 1 until the end of the experiment (at 22 d of age). At 7 d of age, 5 fecal samples were collected and pooled from the floor of each of the 3 isolators to make 3 pools (1 from each isolator) and examined by RT-PCR to ensure the absence of enteric viruses. At this time, 22 birds each in groups A and B (7 d of age) were inoculated orally (1 mL/bird) with PES and non-PES supernatant, respectively. Birds in group C (n = 22) were given PBS only and were referred to as the negative control group. Six birds in each group were not inoculated in order to serve as sentinel birds. The animal care protocol for this experiment was approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Minnesota (St. Paul).

Pale distended intestines with watery contents, and distended ceca with loose to watery and frothy contents were seen.

The intestinal wall was noticeably thin and the intestine was filled with gas in most birds. Similar changes were also noticed at 11 and 16 DPI.

The clinical findings in poults inoculated with material from the PES flock were consistent with those reported in previous studies (Koci et al., 2003; Tang et al., 2006; Pantin-Jackwood et al., 2008b; Jindal et al., 2009b). The lack of mortality in our study is in contrast to Pantin-Jackwood et al. (2008b) who reported high mortality in turkeys inoculated with 3 different types of TAstV-2. However, our results are consistent with those of Jindal et al. (2009b), who did not report any mortality in experimental birds inoculated with PES material containing rotavirus, TAstV-2, and Salmonella. Mortality may depend on the virulence and dose of the pathogen, and on the age of the bird at inoculation (Yu et al., 2000; Pantin-Jackwood et al., 2008b).",

Though we did not calculate the feed intake in different groups, our daily subjective observation indicated a larger amount of unconsumed feed in the group inoculated with the PES material than that in the other 2 groups. Nighot et al. (2010) reported that TAstV-2 infection induces sodium malabsorption, possibly through redistribution of specific sodium transporters, which results in osmotic diarrhea. In our study, the 16% growth depression in group A birds inoculated with PES material is of considerable economic significance. Barnes et al. (2000) estimated that a 10 to 15% growth depression due to PEC would cause losses of $300 to $400 million annually to the US turkey industry. It is also possible that birds with enteritis are not able to achieve their target weight at marketing age (Odetallah et al., 2001; Jindal et al., 2009c). In fact, a light turkey syndrome has been observed in Minnesota, where turkey weight is 4 to 5 pounds lower at marketing age in some farms. We hypothesize that enteric virus infections at an early age play a role in this syndrome.",

The shedding pattern of TAstV-2 in sentinel birds in our study indicates that an infection induced by this virus may continue for a long period in a flock because of the availability of a sufficiently susceptible population. Though the spread can occur in both types of flocks, it seems that in apparently healthy flocks, this virus may assume a pathogenic role if birds are stressed. The presence of concurrent infections may further complicate the situation. We tested the fecal samples for rotavirus, reovirus, and coronavirus and found them to be negative for these 3 viruses. The inocula and samples were also found negative for Salmonella. Though our samples and inocula were negative for the aforesaid pathogens, the effect of other enteric pathogens in the inocula or poults in causing or increasing the severity of enteritis in experimental poults cannot be ruled out. Although the volume of inocula in both groups was the same, we cannot be certain that the amount of virus present in these inocula was the same.
