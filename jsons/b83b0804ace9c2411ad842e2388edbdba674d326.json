Obviously, we possess no such knowledge for any zoonotic virus or zoonotic disease, but casting the emergence process in this context underscores how disciplinary boundaries are blurred; advances require approaches spanning the spectrum of biological inquiry, and solutions to imminent threats require approaches unbounded by the notion of specific scientific discipline.",

The dynamic circumstances and relative importance of the participants reflect the evolutionary context in which zoonotic agents have become accommodated to, and been accommodated by, their reservoir hosts (H R s) (see the chapters by Cleaveland et al. and by Holmes and Drummond, this volume) , the diversity of reservoir species involved, their geographic ranges and the local dispersion of host and pathogen populations. In turn, historical factors have modified and blurred traditional patterns of species distribution, abundance, and diversity, and are continually transforming the landscape of opportunity on which zoonotic viruses with their H R s mingle with novel, potentially susceptible secondary host species (H S )s (see the chapters by Daszak et al., Field et al., Regnery, and Wang and Eaton, this volume) . The current historical circumstances are unprecedented in their efficiency for continually shuffling an expanding repertoire of zoonotic viruses and hosts, introducing them in novel ecologic circumstances to a wealth of previously unavailable and unexplored niches. Within the last decade, the accelerated pace of rapid translocations of infected H R s or H S s have heralded a sea change in how we view the public health threat posed by zoonotic viruses (Childs 2004) , as testified by the emergence of SARs coronavirus (SARS CoV) ; see the chapter by Wang and Eaton, this volume) , influenza A subtype H5N1 (Peiris et al. 2004 ; see chapter by Webby et al., this volume), West Nile virus (WNV) (Lanciotti et al. 1999) , Nipah virus (NiV) (Chua et al. 1999 ; see the chapter by Field et al., this volume) , and Monkeypox virus ; see the chapter by Regnery, this volume).",

Once sustained transmission occurs within the human host, evolutionary adaptation between virus and host can transform the once zoonotic virus into a distinctive new virus with a new human H R . The new virus associated with humans must be quantitatively and qualitatively different from ancestral strains in genetic and phenotypic characters, in order to designate the emergence of a new biological entity. With HIV and pandemic influenza subtypes, the qualities of the newly adapted viruses to humans are readily apparent in terms of host preference and host pathogenicity (Hahn et al. 2000; Claas 2000) . With SARS CoV infecting humans, the specific genetic changes are less clear-cut (Song et al. 2005) , most probably because the transmission of SARS CoV was curtailed early its relationship to the new human host. Support for this conclusion is based on the genetic differences accrued by SARS CoVs sustained through multiple generations of human-to-human transmission as compared with those viruses with shorter interhuman passages .",

The arboviruses, yellow fever virus, and the four dengue serotypes circulate in a human-tohuman transmission cycle mediated by anthropophilic H V s after introduction by bridging H V s feeding on infected primate H R s (de Silva et al. 1999; Wolfe et al. 2001; Monath 1989; Downs 1982) ; these viruses appear closely related to the wild type viruses circulating in sylvatic cycles, although regional variation is apparent (Bryant and Barrett 2003) . Viral adaptation to the human H R appears in most cases to be critical to developing a virus with pandemic potential (Mims 1991 (Mims , 1995 . The introduction of avian-like gene segments into preexisting, aerosol-transmitted, human influenza A viruses, or alternatively, the introduction of key genetic components into preexisting avian viruses (see the chapter by Webby et al., this volume) may be prerequisite to pandemic influenza A emergence (Claas 2000) . The emergence of SARS into the human population was accompanied by strong and rapid positive selection of different subtypes of virus as indicated by comparisons of sequence data from humans and from palm civets and rhinolophid bats, putative H R s, or intermediate hosts (H I s) for SARS CoV (Lau et al. 2005; Song et al. 2005 ; see the chapter by Wang and Eaton, this volume).",

The relative fitness defined by R 0 is a composite of three terms c , the contact rate or number of contacts per unit time, p , the transmission probability per contact, and d , the duration of infectiousness (see the chapter by Real and Biek, this volume).

            "text": "The underlying feature distinguishing modifying factors (Fig. 1 , right panel) from transition stages in zoonotic virus emergence (Fig. 1, left panel) is that the former requires the substrate provided by the latter on which to act. Modifying Disease emergence can occur at the local and regional level or as a pandemic depending on the nature of the pathogen and the influence of modifying factors. Modifying factors are largely responsible for driving the magnitude and geographic scope of an emergent event, but by themselves are insufficient to lead to disease emergence. Although only a single population source for a zoonotic pathogen is indicated, the reservoir host (H R ) population, the schema is modular and readily accommodates inclusion of vector (H V ) populations and intermediate vertebrate host (H I or H S 1 ) populations antecedent to spillover to humans (see Fig. 1 in the chapter by Childs, this volume). Transition stages, with the exception of contact (Transition 1) and cross-species transmission (spillover; Transition 2), are not strictly hierarchical in the emergence process. Transition stages are shown to the left of the population boxes and the two transitions required for emergence (contact and spillover) are shaded gray. In the center are two population boxes, the top shaded box indicating a H R population, in which a zoonotic virus or some other zoonotic pathogen circulates, and the bottom shaded box indicating the secondary host population (H S ) affected by pathogen spillover (assumed in most instances to be humans). The graded shaded pyramid within the H S population indicates that emergence often proceeds through a gradient of human population sizes and social connectivity. Spillover and human transmission chains in remote villages (apex of pyramid) can lead to spread to urban centers (base of pyramid), at which point a pathogen is assumed to have access to the entire H S population demarcated by the H S box. To the left of the population boxes are Fig. 1 Continued examples of modifying factors. Contact and spillover are sufficient to result in disease emergence at the local, regional, or even continental scale through reiterative introductions, as exemplified by zoonotic diseases such as rabies or West Nile fever. The two solid black lines with arrowheads leading from the H R then directly through the H S to local or regional emergence (the first emergence box) represent reiterative events as a pathway to emergence. Two other transitions not essential for emergence, but critical to pandemic disease emergence, require sustained intra-H S transmission of the zoonotic pathogen (Transition 3) and, potentially, adaptation to the human host (e.g., SARs coronavirus). Sequential human-to-human transmission of a zoonotic pathogen at the local and regional scales is indicated by the series of broken white lines in the H S pyramid. Evolutionary forces can transform a zoonotic agent into a genetically distinct agent adapted to a new reservoir host, establishing the former H S as a new H R (e.g., SIV to HIV; avian influenza to pandemic human influenza). This transition and the modifying factors associated with the geographical location and context of the initial disease outbreak (white arrows in shaded H S cone) can ultimately precipitate a pandemic emergence (e.g., HIV and pandemic influenza). The process of emergence for any zoonotic pathogen can fail at a minimum of three points, indicated by the labeled dashed lines with arrowheads leading out of the H S population box to the right. Zoonotic pathogens may fail to initiate cross-species infection following exposures (top dashed line), fail to generate any additional infections within the H S (second dashed line), or experience epidemic fadeout when sustained human-to-human transmission fails and R 0 decreases below unity (third dashed line). The initial transition to sustained intra-H S transmission is prone to failure when populations are sparse or social connectivity is limited. (Modified from Childs 2004) factors alter the likelihood of a transition occurring and drive the geographic spread and determine the magnitude of morbidity and mortality resulting from a particular instance of emergence.",

            "text": "Abiotic factors alter the potential for contact between H R and H S populations, or infectious intermediaries, and modulate the potential for spillover; zoonotic diseases highly dependent on abiotic factors are often labeled environmentally driven epizootics (Allen and Cormier 1996) . On a global scale, climate change has been increasingly linked to instances of zoonotic disease emergence, with El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) providing the largest interannual signal of climate variation (Wang et al. 1999 ). One hypothesized mechanism by which ENSO triggers increased incidence of zoonotic disease among humans, is through a chain of sequentially induced events referred to as a trophic cascade (Polis et al. 2000) , ultimately leading to increased numbers of individuals among H R or H V populations and increasing the risk of human exposure to a zoonotic pathogen (Nicholls 1986; Kelly-Hope et al. 2004; Bi and Parton 2003; Glass et al. 2002; Anyamba et al. 2001 ). ENSO events have been correlated with increased risk of HPS and plague in the southeastern United States (Glass et al. 2002; Parmenter et al. 1999) , increased infection by Ross River virus in Australia (Lindsay and Mackenzie 1997; Kelly-Hope et al. 2004) , and arthropod-vectored Bartonella bacilliformis and visceral leishmaniasis in South America (Chinga-Alayo et al. 2004; Franke et al. 2002) . Local weather conditions, potentially driven by global climate variation, have been repeatedly shown to influence the emergence of zoonotic and vector-borne viruses. Drought can serve to amplify enzootic transmission of St. Louis virus (Shaman et al. 2002) and possibly Japanese encephalitis (Hanna et al. 1999; Mackenzie et al. 2002) and Ebola viruses (Pinzon et al. 2004 ; see the chapter by Gonzalez et al., this volume), ultimately placing humans at higher risk for spillover. The converse, excessive rainfall, can increase breeding populations of H V s, driving enzootic transmission levels of western equine encephalomyelitis virus, Ross River virus, and Rift Valley fever virus to heightened levels, and ultimately increasing zoonotic virus spillover to humans (Lindsay et al. 1993; Wegbreit and Reisen 2000; Linthicum et al. 1999 ).",

Viruses with high replication rates, high mutation rates, and increased potential for recombination or reassortment may more readily adapt to new fitness landscapes and become transmitted among humans to emerge as pandemic threats (Burke 1998; Nichol et al. 2000) ; examples include HIV and subtypes of Influenza A (Hahn et al. 2000; Claas, 2000 ; see the chapter by Webby et al., this volume). The intrinsic genetic variability in susceptibility to infectious diseases within the human H S (Segal and Hill 2003) is further modulated by an individual's cumulative life experience and history of infection by various pathogens, reflected by acquired immunological memory or, possibly, an individual's ancestry and evolutionary imprint of prior exposure to pathogens (Gillespie 1975; Lipsitch and Sousa 2002) . Furthermore, immunologic function and the susceptibility of individual humans to infection and disease are dynamic and vary with factors such as nutritional status and age (Boelle et al. 2004) .",

In theory, virus evolution is affected by socially structured host populations, such as where some human populations are aggregated in remote villages, with limited opportunity for social interchange. Models of virus transmission which assume homogeneous or freely mixing populations are of limited use in such circumstances. In such settings, modest increases in the number of generations of human-to-human transmission sustained by a new virus prior to fadeout (Fig. 1 , second terminal dotted line) improves the likelihood of virus evolution to a higher average R 0 , and hence emergence (Antia et al. 2003) .",

One trend leads to the rapid evolution of increasingly virulent viruses. When viruses of relatively low virulence are transmitted among dispersed metapopulations of hosts, the result can be a cluster of infected individuals surrounding an index case, which is rapidly transformed into a semi-impermeable barrier of immune individuals (Boots et al. 2004) , effectively terminating additional transmission. Virulent viruses causing lethal infections leave no immune survivors to block transmission and, in the course of removing infected individuals, further enhance the sparseness of the existing social structure. In situations where viruses of relatively low virulence circulate, the introduction of a highly virulent virus strain, either through an infected immigrant or from viral recombination, can alter the evolutionary trajectory of virus-host adaptation favoring selection for increasing virulence and an alternative, evolutionarily stable situation (White et al. 2002; Boots et al. 2004 ).",

Certain bird species sustained WNV viremias of sufficient titer and duration to infect blood-feeding \"bridge vectors\" (Turell et al. 2001; Komar et al. 2003) , maintaining transmission to humans and spreading WNV as migrating birds followed traditional flyways (Peterson et al. 2003) .

The emergence of zoonotic viruses among humans or domestic livestock where our species has drifted into preexisting sylvatic foci of zoonotic viruses is driven by local circumstance, history, and serendipity. The role of livestock, such as horses and pigs, can be pivotal in a transmission chain leading to human infection, as illustrated by the henipaviruses (see the chapters by Daniels et al. and Field et al., this volume) . NiV and HeV first jumped the species barrier to infect pigs and horses, respectively, and only then were transmitted by these H I s to humans (Barclay and Paton 2000; Chua et al. 1999 ). However, these two viruses also demonstrate the importance of transmissibility in the H I s influencing the ultimate emergence of human disease; NiV was readily transmitted among pigs while HeV was rarely transmitted among horses or from horse to human (see the chapter by Daniels et al., this volume) .",

The crowded living conditions within shanty towns are further degraded by poor sanitation and lack of water; these conditions have been associated with the emergence of diseases, notably those involving vector-transmitted pathogens (Gratz 1999; Gubler 2002; Mackenzie et al. 2004) .",

Nowhere has the role of rapid transportation been more evident than with SARS CoV (Table 1 ) , where a presumed focus of human infection in the wet markets of Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China, where live animals or their products are available for purchase, was transformed into a global health problem affecting 27 nations on every populated continent (Heymann 2004 ; see the chapter by Wang and Eaton, this volume). The human SARS CoV appears to have been inadvertently transported to a wet-market, along with an infected H I or H R , on a journey destined to end with human consumption (Bell et al. 2004) . Wildlife farming and an immense network of illegal national and international trade in wildlife has been fueled by human demands for wildlife products of unusual culinary or putative medicinal properties (Bell et al. 2004 ).

Failure to cross the species barrier (spillover) aligns with \"fails in transport\"; failure to sustain transmission, with a transmission potential, R 0 <1, aligns with \"fails to establish\"; and interruption of sustained intra-H S transmission, an average R 0 <1, aligns with \"noninvasion\" by the nonindigenous species. Differences between disease emergence and biological invasion exist, as transitions leading to disease emergence are not strictly hierarchical. Reiteration of contact and spillover (Fig. 1, transitions 1 and 2) at sufficiently high levels can suffice for a disease to emerge, but if an invading species never moves and perishes at the site of its introduction, even if repeatedly introduced to the site, further establishment and spread, prerequisites of invasion, is precluded. In addition to biological factors which establish the setting in which zoonotic pathogens may emerge (see the chapters by Cleaveland et al. and Daszak et al., this volume) , the emergence of a zoonotic agent within human or animal populations must be detected by humans. Too often the presence of a zoonotic agent is first identified by the presence of disease in humans, and surveillance for disease emergence is largely restricted to identifying incident cases of disease in humans rather than monitoring infection or disease among wildlife H R s or H I s (see the chapters by Childs, by Merianos, and by Stallknecht, this volume). The challenges present to designing programs aiming to disrupt transmission of a zoonotic pathogen within a wildlife reservoir host population prior to spillover and disease emergence are discussed in the chapters by Childs and by Stallknecht in this volume.",

The invasion process in Fig. 1 has an organismal or medical orientation, which can be transformed to a population or community orientation by regarding humans, rather than a zoonotic pathogen, as the invasive species. Human invasion of new habitats and new environments is a frequently cited factor in the emergence process of viral zoonoses (Morse 1995; Institute of Medicine 2003) . Where native H R s and H V s and their co-evolved viral pathogens exist in natural foci (Pavlovsky 1957) , enhanced opportunities for novel ecologic interactions await. Initial instances of emergence have proven unpredictable as exemplified by HPS resulting from transmission of hantaviruses maintained by sigmodontine rodent H R s in North America (Monroe et al. 1999) , HIV resulting from transmission of SIVs circulating among nonhuman primate H R s in West Africa (Apetrei et al. 2004) , and NiV and HeV viruses from pteropid bat H R s in Asia and Australia (Field et al. 2001 ). Herein, we stress the organismal-medical orientation, humans colonized or invaded by zoonotic viruses. Human intrusion into novel environments is regarded as an anthropogenic factor which modifies the likelihood of contact and spillover transitions occurring. However, without the preexisting sylvatic zoonotic cycle, human invasion alone would not engender the first case of illness along the path to emergence.",

Although the RNA genomes of these two zoonotic viruses are markedly different in terms of organization, polarity, and replication strategy, both viruses show evidence of reduced positive selection , even where established within novel H R s or H V s . The term \"evolutionary generalists\" has been applied to both viruses as they share, to some extent, the requirement of being able to infect and multiply within cells belonging to different species and, in the case of vector-borne WNV, the need to infect and multiply within avian, mammalian, and insect H R s, H V s, and H S s.

However, the origin of SARS-CoV as a human pathogen arising from direct cross-species transmission of a preexisting, but previously unknown virus (Gibbs et al. 2004; Holmes and Rambaut 2004 ; see the chapters by Holmes and Drummond and by Wang and Eaton, this volume) or as a virus formed from the recombination of existing mammalian and avian coronaviruses (Rest and Mindell 2003; Zhang et al. 2004 ) has been the subject of debate. SARS-CoV is sufficiently distinct in genetic sequence from previously known coronaviruses ) that a long history of preexistence with its natural H R population is surmised (Parashar and Anderson 2004) . Recently, coronaviruses related to SARS-Cov have been amplified by PCR from three communal cave-dwelling species of the genus Rhinolophus in the family Rhinolophidae. Genome sequence analysis indicated that SARS-like coronaviruses among these bats have an almost identical genome organization to those of SARS-CoVs isolated from humans or civets ; see the chapter by Wang and Eaton, this volume). These data suggest that bats serve as the H R of SARS-CoV and that palm civets served as a H S1 in a chain of events leading to infection of humans as secondarily infected H S2 . SARS-CoV's global emergence may be an extraordinary example of a relatively unmodified zoonotic virus, successfully sustained by intrahuman transmission. However, increasing data suggest SARS-CoV was a virus rapidly adapting to its new human host and the rapid and effective public health response terminating its transmission halted an evolutionary dramas in the making (see the chapter by Wang and Eaton, this volume).",

Adaptation to the human host may be mediated by viral preadaptation to a genetically similar intermediate host, as is hypothesized to occur among swine for avian-adapted influenza A subtypes (see the chapter by Webby et al., this volume). Permissive cells for subtype A influenza virus replication in the pig's respiratory track have cell-surface glycoprotein receptors recognized by some avian-adapted viruses, in addition to some human-adapted influenza viruses (Basler et al. 2001 ). In the case of HIV, the H R for SIVs giving rise to HIV-1 was our closest living genetic relative, the chimpanzee ( Pan troglodytes troglodytes ) (Gao et al. 1999) , and the H R for HIV-2 was a sooty mangabey ( Cerocebus atys ) (Hirsch et al. 1989 ), a respectfully close relative of the order Primates. Spillover was enhanced by the enormous population of candidate viruses within the genetically heterogeneous \"quasispecies\" of viruses present in the infected H R at spillover. Sustained intrahuman transmission was accompanied by viral adaptations to the human host, readily detectable and quantifiable by sequence changes in the RNA genome and marked by qualitative phenotypic changes identifiable by host species preference and pathogenic interactions (Hirsch et al. 1989; Gao et al. 1999 ).",

The human lentiviruses, HIV-1 and HIV-2, have evolved and escaped from remote African settings on at least eight independent occasions to emerge as distinctive genetic subtypes responsible for regional or pandemic human disease (Apetrei et al. 2004; B. Hahn, personal communication) . These recognized cases of emergence are certainly not the first instances where SIVs have successfully crossed species and evolved as distinctive HIVs of humans.
