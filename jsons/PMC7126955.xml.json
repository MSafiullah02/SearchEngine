In 2015, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported that lower respiratory infection caused 3.2 million deaths worldwide (World Health Organization (WHO), 2017). In particular, pneumonia mortality rates are substantially higher in children under five and adults over 75 years of age. Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a type of pneumonia that develops in people with limited or no contact with the healthcare system. The incidence of CAP varies by age, country, and gender; however, the clinical impact of CAP is clear that patients with CAP often require hospitalization and CAP increases mortality (Welte et al., 2012, Wunderink and Waterer, 2014).",

Through development of diagnostic techniques, various pathogens can be effectively detected in clinical samples (Huijskens et al., 2013, Jennings et al., 2008), and the clinical characteristics of mixed infection in CAP have been described in several reports (Chiu et al., 2015, Cilloniz et al., 2011, Jennings et al., 2008). A possible correlation between mixed infection and the severity of diseases was reported. However, data on the clinical features of bacterial and viral coinfection, especially in adult patients with CAP are still limited. Therefore, we retrospectively investigated adult, hospitalized patients with CAP and analyzed the incidence, etiology, clinical features, and outcomes of bacterial and viral coinfection in these patients.",

Blood cultures were performed aerobically and anaerobically using the BacT/Alert 3D blood culture system (bioM\u00e9rieux Inc., Marcy-l'Etoile, France). The Vitek 2 system (bioM\u00e9rieux Inc.) was used for bacterial identification. Sputum samples were Gram-stained and examined. Following, they were accepted as suitable for quantitative culture when more than 25 leukocytes per 100\u00d7 microscopic field were visible with few epithelial cells. Suitable sputum specimens were cultured on blood agar plates and MacConkey agar. The specimens of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, cerebrospinal fluid, pleural puncture, and tracheobronchial aspirates were collected and cultured when available. For PCR detection of bacterial and viral pathogens, nasopharyngeal swab specimens were examined using the Seeplex PneumoBacter ACE Detection (PneumoBacter; Seegene, Seoul, South Korea) and Anyplex II RV16 Detection (RV16; Seegene) systems. A qualitative PCR assay, PneumoBacter, could detect six common lower respiratory tract infection pathogens: Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenza, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, Bordetella pertussis, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. With real-time PCR-based RV16, 16 common pathogens causing respiratory infection could be detected, including Adenovirus, Influenza A and B, Parainfluenza virus 1, 2, 3 and 4, Rhinovirus A/B/C, Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) A and B, Bocavirus 1/2/3/4, Metapneumovirus, Coronavirus 229E, NL63, and OC43, and Enterovirus. Antibody test for M. pneumonia (M. pneumoniae ELISA Kit, Zeus Scientific, NJ, USA) was tested in paired serum samples, and a four-fold increment of serum IgG was considered as a causative pathogen. Additionally, HIV screening assay (ARCHITECT HIV Ag/Ab Combo, Abbott Laboratories, Wiesbaden, Germany), urinary Streptococcus pneumoniae antigen test (SD BIOLINE Strep A strip, Alere, MA, USA) and rapid influenza antigen test (SD BIOLINE Influenza Ag, Alere) were performed.",

A P-value of less than 0.05 was considered as a significant difference. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was employed to identify risk factors for bacterial and viral coinfection. To select the final model, we used stepwise backward selection with an entry probability of 0.05 and a removal probability of 0.1.

Our findings indicated that more than half of adult patients with CAP (55.3%) had evidence of infection with one or more bacteria and/or viruses, and 32 patients with CAP (13.6%) could be classified with bacterial and viral coinfection. In another study of 304 adult patients with CAP, bacterial and viral coinfection was identified in 45 patients (14.8%) (Jennings et al., 2008). Among 64 severe CAP patients, the bacterial and viral coinfections were confirmed in 14 patients (21.9%) in our study, and this result was similar with previous reports that showed about 16.6\u201339% in severe CAP or critically ill patients (Karhu et al., 2014, Martin-Loeches et al., 2017, Voiriot et al., 2016). These findings suggested that at least one tenth of adult CAP patients and one fifth of severe CAP patients were suffering from bacterial and viral concurrent infection.",

In this study, the most commonly identified viral pathogen causing concurrent coinfection was RSV, which differs from a previous report (Jennings et al., 2008). We believe that this difference could be caused by many factors, such as different racial backgrounds and geographical factors. However, due to the limited number of coinfected patients available for analysis, we could not confirm how the patient's prognosis might change depending on the combination of causative viral and bacterial pathogens. This problem should be addressed through additional large cohort studies.",

We suspected that structural lung abnormalities would have an effect on the bacterial and viral coinfection; however, it remained unclear how these factors would affect the coinfection. In comparisons between the coinfected group and other groups, there were few differences in baseline characteristics. In physical findings, body temperature, neutrophil percentage and count, and CRP were higher in bacterial and viral coinfected patients with CAP. As for the clinical prognosis, there were no differences in distribution of CURB-65 and PSI. However, the proportion of IDSA/ATS severe pneumonia and mortality rate were higher in the bacterial and viral coinfected CAP group than in the group without coinfection. In addition, our data showed that the concurrent infection of bacterial and viral pathogens was identified as one of the significant risk factors independently associated with mortality. These findings were consistent with the results of previous reports (Cawcutt and Kalil, 2017, Martin-Loeches et al., 2017, Voiriot et al., 2016), and would suggest that the concurrent bacterial and viral infection would be directly associated with more severe symptoms and worse prognosis.",

There are several possible reasons for such results. First, interactions between bacteria and viruses would underlie the pathogenesis of CAP. As well-known synergism exists between influenza and S. pneumoniae (Klein et al., 2016, McCullers, 2006), bacterial-viral interaction would be fatal to pneumonia patients and increase mortality dramatically. Various viral mechanisms, such as disruption of the epithelial barrier, upregulation of adhesion proteins, or dysfunction of the immune system, could facilitate the bacterial infection (Bosch et al., 2013, Morris et al., 2017), and we assume that these synergisms could play a role in worsening pneumonia. Second, most patients with CAP were treated with appropriate antimicrobial therapy; however, antiviral agents were very limited and treatment of adult pneumonia patients with confirmed causative viral pathogens required supportive care. These treatments could not prevent viral replication, and we suspected that it would be associated with worsened outcomes in adult patients with CAP. With the exception of bacterial coinfection in influenza (Chertow and Memoli, 2013, Morris et al., 2017), however, the role of antiviral agents in bacterial and viral coinfected patients with CAP has not yet been elucidated.",

We were limited in obtaining detailed patient information, such as socioeconomic factors, lifestyle, physical and psychiatric status, or previous hospitalization history. Second, although various tests were performed to identify pathogens causing CAP, there were limitations in discovering all causative pathogens. Additionally, there was a possibility that methodological issues could have made it difficult to detect every bacterial and viral coinfection. Third, medical records only tracked the disease histories of patients with CAP during hospital stays. We admit that some clinical outcomes could be misjudged in this study due to voluntary discharge, transfer to other hospitals, or euthanasia. Further large prospective research is needed to resolve the present limitations and confirm the results of this study.",
