The patient was previously treated with a monoclonal antibody against lymphocytes to which he developed allergy and subsequently received high-dose steroids for several weeks before admission. The patient was asymptomatic except for fever on admission, with no dyspnea, the physical examination was unremarkable and there was no hypoxia. The chest x-ray was normal (Fig. 10.1, panel A), while CT revealed diffuse, bilateral ground-glass infiltrates (Fig. 10.2). The patient was admitted to hospital and treated with piperacillin-tazobactam. A few days later the neutrophil count increased to >500/mm3, the patient remained asymptomatic but pyrexial with no apparent source of infection. The antibiotic was discontinued. One day later the patient developed severe dyspnea and hypoxia requiring transfer to the ICU. Chest X-ray demonstrated diffuse bilateral infiltrates (Fig. 10.1, panel B).\n\n\nWhat is the appropriate evaluation?\n\nWhat treatment should be initiated empirically?\n\nShould steroids be discontinued?\n\nWhat is the likely diagnosis?\n\n",

            "text": "The ominous prognosis of cancer patients with or without neutropenia in need of intensive care has led to reservations with regard to admission of cancer patients to the ICU. However, significant improvements in ICU and in-hospital survival of cancer patients in ICU have been demonstrated in studies in recent years [1\u20134]. Risk \u00adfactors for mortality have shifted from those related to the underlying condition to those related to the severity of acute illness similar to other critically-ill patients. Neutropenia per se and the underlying malignancy (solid and hematological) do not have an impact on the outcome of patients in ICU. Recent chemotherapy is associated rather with improved survival [3, 5\u20137], while organ dysfunction, severity of disease scores, need for vasopressor treatment, need for mechanical ventilation immediately or after noninvasive ventilation, no definite diagnosis and a non-\u00adinfectious diagnosis are associated with mortality [1\u20133, 8]. Invasive aspergillosis is also associated with very high mortality rates in ICU (see below). In several studies, admission to ICU in the early stages of sepsis or other acute event was associated with better survival than admission later, after development of organ dysfunction. Performance status is perhaps the most important and only variable relating to the underlying condition that is correlated with ICU death. The prognosis remains guarded for certain cancer patients, including patients after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) with active uncontrolled graft versus host disease, those with relapse of the primary disease after allogeneic HSCT and special cases of solid cancer including pulmonary carcinomatous lymphangitis and carcinomatous meningitis with coma [9].",

It occurs usually later than the initial worsening following neutrophil recovery, days to weeks after immune reconstitution. Diagnosis is difficult and is based mostly on negative cultures and biomarkers for the initial infection and treatment is with corticosteroids.

Beyond the poor bioavailability of orally administered drugs in the critically-ill patient, absorption and side effects of specific antiretrovirals frequently depend on the provision of concurrent oral feeding. Drug interactions are common; for \u00adexample proton-pump inhibitors and histamine-2 blockers are contraindicated with protease inhibitors (PIs). All nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), except for abacavir, require dose adjustment for renal failure. Several PIs require dose adjustment for hepatic impairment [19]. Thus, fixed drug combination usually cannot be used in patients with renal and hepatic impairment; individual drugs must be dose-adjusted and administered separately. Drug-related adverse effects are common, although few may be relevant in the critical care setting. NRTIs (mainly stavudine, didanosine, and zidovudine) may induce lactic acidosis. Abacavir-related hypersensitivity is a serious adverse event and this drug should be administered only after genetic testing for HLA-B*5701.",

The question in this scenario is whether to initiate antiretroviral therapy early while treating the acute infection or after its successful management. Aside from the practical difficulties in the administration of HAART in ICU, there is the fear of IRIS with worsening of the underlying infectious process during immune reconstitution. IRIS can occur between days to weeks after initiation of HAART [19]. Although logically predicted by rising CD4 counts, it can occur before significant CD4 cell count increase or viral load suppression [20].",

Three trials have shown a clinical benefit for early, but not immediate antiretroviral drug initiation (e.g. within 2 weeks of starting anti-infective treatment), for patients mostly with pulmonary tuberculosis and PCP [21\u201323]. One study showed no difference in outcomes for patients with pulmonary and extrapulmonary tuberculoisis [24]. In contrast two trials assessing HIV patients with meningitis showed no benefit or increased harm with early initiation of HAART initiation [25, 26] (Table 10.2). There is no direct evidence on timing of HAART initiation in the critical care setting. Summarizing the evidence from existing trials, it seems that the initiation HAART about 2 weeks after anti-infective therapy directed at the opportunistic infection is reasonable for patients with pulmonary infections, including tuberculosis. This allows the time for patient stabilization, HIV drug resistance testing and involving an HIV specialist in the management and all treatment decisions. With tuberculosis or cryptococcal meningitis, the start of HAART should probably be deferred for longer.\n",

In other patients, HAART can probably be discontinued after consultation with an HIV expert. HIV/ hepatitis B co-infected patients require special consideration.
