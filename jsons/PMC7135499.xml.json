By preventing contamination of hospital personnel's skin, regular clothing, personal items, and medical instruments, pathogen transmission from equine patients to their caregivers can be reduced. Barrier techniques may also be used to reduce the risk of infection of other hospitalized patients from hospital personnel's regular clothing or equipment that might act as fomites and to reduce the risk of infection of hospitalized animals with pathogens from the resident microflora of hospital personnel.",

The epidemic of HIV in the general population and HCWs led to the development of universal precautions. Based on universal precautions, infection control practices are applied to all patients, regardless of known or suspected infectious disease status, and emphasize the prevention of any contact with blood or certain body fluids [2]. In veterinary medicine, there currently are not the same concerns about transmission of bloodborne pathogens to veterinary personnel. Indeed, the attitude toward blood contamination in veterinary medicine is somewhat cavalier. Nevertheless, it is critical to remember that new diseases are emerging at all times and that many of these new diseases are zoonotic. Just because there is minimal concern about bloodborne pathogens of horses at this point in time does not mean that there is no risk posed by exposure to equine blood now or in the future. It is prudent to ensure that adequate precautions be taken now rather than waiting for the infection of large numbers of veterinary personnel to stimulate change, as occurred in human medicine.",

The type of personal protective equipment required for each situation has been left to the discretion of the employee and employer; however, potentially contaminated body fluids are not to reach the employee's work clothes or street clothes, undergarments, skin, eyes, mouth, or other mucous membranes [3]. The level of barrier protection required would thus depend on the risk of contact with body fluids of concern, the potential for splashing or aerosol exposure, the volume of fluid that might be produced, and the duration of exposure [1]. These same points are relevant in the veterinary context. Veterinary hospitals need to be aware of OSHA or equivalent rules to provide a safe workplace and avoid potential liability. Thus, the development of appropriate infection control protocols, including barrier precautions, is required. In general, consideration must be given to the route of pathogen transmission: contact (direct or indirect), droplet, airborne, common vehicle (eg, equipment, medical devices), and vector borne.",

Additionally, outerwear should be changed frequently (at least daily), because gross contamination does not need to be present for pathogen contamination to have occurred. Hospital personnel should change their hospital outerwear before leaving the building; coveralls, laboratory coats, surgical scrubs, and related items should not be worn out of the hospital setting.

Examination gloves that are clean but not sterile are often used when handling wounds, infected body sites, and animals known or likely to be shedding pathogens in body fluids from orifices or on their skin; however, widespread use of examination gloves and protocols regarding glove use are not common. At the Ontario Veterinary College Veterinary Teaching Hospital (OVC-VTH), a policy requiring glove use for any contact with equine patients was instituted in response to nosocomial and zoonotic transmission of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Whether this has reduced the transmission of MRSA or other MDR bacteria at the OVC-VTH is under investigation. Objective data are not available to help develop glove use protocols for veterinary hospitals; however, it is reasonable to recommend that gloves be worn whenever there might be contact with nasal secretions; feces; or discharge from surgical incisions, draining abscesses, or wounds.",

All these factors must be considered when choosing a gown for use in a hospital (nonsurgical) situation. In particular, the ability to resist contamination during anticipated animal contacts, ease of use, and cost are important. The most likely problem in veterinary practice is poor resistance to liquids, especially under direct contact or pressure. In equine medicine, there is a greater likelihood of high-volume contact with fluids (ie, diarrheic horse) or direct contact with patient surfaces that would have moist secretions or excretions (ie, horse with nasal discharge rubbing against personnel). These types of high-risk situations must be considered when choosing an appropriate gown. Additionally, prolonged contact with potentially infectious patients, such as with 24-hour nursing care of neonatal intensive care unit foals, creates additional problems. If gowns do not cover the entire body (eg, gowns that do not cover the lower extremities) and hospital personnel are in prolonged contact situations with foals, the likelihood of contamination is high. Full body gowns may be more appropriate in these situations.",

Although MRSA is not considered to be spread via the airborne route, the main location of colonization of MRSA in hospital personnel is in the nasal passages, and hand-to-nose contact is frequent. Thus, mask use prevents direct contact between the hand and nose, thereby decreasing hand contamination or decreasing the risk of inoculation of the nose after contamination of the hands during contact with a horse. The actual benefit of masks during short-term patient contact situations is unclear.",

Like most other infection control methods, barrier precautions are only effective if used appropriately, and poor compliance is an ever-present concern that can have a negative impact on the entire infection control program. Failure of barrier techniques may involve inherent weaknesses in the items used, inappropriate selection of items, inappropriate use of items, inadequate training of personnel, or the inherent inability of barrier precautions to prevent pathogen transmission completely in all cases. It is important that barrier items do not create a false sense of security. Barrier items are useful but by no means 100% effective at preventing transmission of pathogens. It is critical that veterinary personnel use all adjunctive infection control techniques (ie, hand hygiene) and not rely solely on barriers. The reported variability in the benefits of barrier precautions should not dissuade hospitals from implementing these protocols.",

Independently, Oliver Wendell Holmes concluded that the hands of HCWs spread puerperal fever, and he described methods for limiting the spread of disease [33]. Formal implementation of hand hygiene policies lagged tremendously, however, and it was well into the twentieth century before an emphasis began to be placed on hand hygiene.

Paradoxically, some studies have shown that handwashing with plain soap may increase bacterial counts on the skin [35], [36]. Handwashing with plain soap before intravenous catheter placement was reported to be no more effective than no hand hygiene at reducing the incidence of catheter complications in human patients [4].",

These may contain a variety of antimicrobial substances, including triclosan, hexachlorophene, povidone-iodine, and chlorhexidine [33]. Unfortunately, compliance with handwashing is typically poor. Studies evaluating handwashing frequency in HCWs have yielded disappointing results, with handwashing only occurring after 12.9% to 75% of situations in which it was indicated [30], [37]. In particular, physicians tend to have poor compliance with hand hygiene protocols [27]. Compliance with hand hygiene protocols is a major challenge for infection control programs. Reasons given for poor compliance with hand hygiene include lack of time, poor access to proper handwashing facilities, and skin damage from repeated washing [33], [38]. Skin damage from repeated handwashing is a definite concern in hospital situations. The frequency of dermatitis can be high in personnel who wash their hands frequently. One study reported that 25% of nurses evaluated had clinical signs of dermatitis and 85% had a history of skin problems [38]. Damaged skin is of particular concern from an infectious control standpoint because it can harbor greater numbers of bacteria than normal skin.",

These products have many advantages over antimicrobial soaps, including their spectrum of antimicrobial activity, speed of activity, dermal tolerance, and ease of use. They also eliminate the chance for cross-contamination from water taps and paper towel dispensers [39]. Increasingly, hand hygiene guidelines are recommending the use of these products when gross contamination of hands is not present [33]. Most alcohol-based hand sanitizers contain 60% to 70% alcohol and may be in a gel or liquid form. Recently, it has been suggested that an alcohol concentration of 80% or higher is desirable, and a product containing 85% alcohol is now available [40]. Although there are potential advantages of alcohol-based products in terms of effectiveness against microorganisms, the main advantage is ease of use. Additionally, alcohol-based hand sanitizers can easily be placed throughout the hospital at minimal cost. As well, individual use bottles can be dispensed to health care providers to keep on their person for ease of use even when wall dispensers are not in the immediate area. Sinks, on the other hand, are difficult and costly to add in an established facility.",

Although much of the information obtained in human medicine can be applied to veterinary hospitals, care must be taken with direct extrapolation of human studies. It is logical to assume that horses would have a higher endogenous bacterial load on their skin because of their haired coat and typical housing methods. This would translate into the potential for greater contamination of the skin on hands of veterinary personnel who handle horses compared with human health care providers. Veterinarians typically wear gloves less commonly than their counterparts in the medical field, and there is a somewhat cavalier attitude taken toward hand contamination in veterinary medicine as compared with human medicine.
