Like the WHO, the AAD already adopted a rapid advice guidelines protocol, but this process relies on evaluating a body of evidence, which does not yet exist for Covid-19.",

A recent JAAD study examined the occurrence of upper respiratory infection (URI) for patients treated with various classes of biologic therapies for psoriasis, as a proxy for risk of Covid-19 infection while on a biologic. 3 While we commend the authors for compiling this data, there are several issues with indirect evidence: i) these trials compared biologics to placebo, ii) they were not powered for the outcome of URI, and iii) the similarity of Covid-19 to URI is unknown. Due in part to these concerns, the AAD Covid-19 taskforce published interim guidance that did not distinguish among biologic classes.",

In cardiology, there has been concern over the use of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE)-inhibitors due to an observational study that many patients with hypertension admitted for Covid-19 were on ACE-inhibitors. 4 In the face of uncertainty, societies including the American College of Cardiology took a stance to keep patients on ACE-inhibitors while they await more evidence. 5 When guidelines can no longer be based on the highest level of evidence, then indirect studies, gray literature, case-reports and expert consensus may be the only tools left in our arsenal. We need 3 guidance not just on biologics, but many topics, including scaling up teledermatology programs and managing patients with invasive skin cancers. These changes to dermatology guidelines do not exist in a vacuum; important ethical implications include patient outcomes such as missed melanomas and the loss of employment for practice staff. With so much uncertainty in our medical practice, guidance is needed now more than ever. We should acknowledge the shift from evidence based medicine to reliance on expert guidance, and appreciate the potential for guideline reversal. But in a time of rapidly changing evidence, we must be willing to take on these risks to guide with the goal of maintaining the highest standard of patient care.",
