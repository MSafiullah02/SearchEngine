Hotels are particularly hard hit by these catastrophes. For example, in Hong Kong, occupancy of many hotels has dropped to below 20% (Neuman et al., 2003). To survive under the dual impact of war and disease, many hotels have accelerated their pace to cut commissions paid to travel agents by building web sites that allow guests to book rooms online at a cheaper rate.",

Today, travel agents throughout the entire world are under this threat (Sandoval, 2002). In May 2002, for example, two big chains, Starwood and Six Continents, took the distribution back from commission-based agents by offering customers 10% off the lowest rate that they can find elsewhere on the Internet (The Economist, 2002). All these moves eroded revenue and speeded up the process of disintermediation for travel agencies especially small ones.",

Negative acts are acts of retaliation that may include: the agent terminates or threatens to terminate its working relationship with the hotel; the agent reduce its effort to market the hotel's rooms; or the agent aggressively criticizes the hotel. These negative acts put direct pressure on the hotel to change its behavior by stressing the adverse consequences of the destructive act (Frazier and Rody, 1991). On the other hand, positive acts may include constructively discussing the problem with the hotel to find a win\u2013win solution; or simply passive acceptance by viewing the problem as transitory and that it would work itself out later on (Hibbard et al., 2001).",

Thus, when an agent attributes a hotel's destructive act as strictly beneficial to the hotel only, the agent may harbor greater hostility toward the hotel, even at the expense of some financial sacrifice on its part (Zwick and Chen, 1999). On the other hand, when the destructive act elicits self or external attributions such as \u201cwe are responsible for this\u201d or \u201cthe September 11 event forced the hotel to sell cheap rooms via the Internet\u201d, the agent would be more likely to respond with more constructive actions or support the hotel through passive acceptance. Surprisingly, self and external attributions can be relationship enhancing because the increased communication resulting from these constructive actions would lead to better understanding between the two parties (Hibbard et al., 2001).",

            "text": "The second macromotive factor to examine is the level of interdependence between channel members. Gundlach and Cadotte (1994) and Lusch and Brown (1996) suggest that if channel members have great stakes in the relationship, and both are dependent on each other for profit, retaliation would not be an attractive option to the parties involved. Instead, they would engage in constructive discussions to resolve their differences. In fact, Kumar et al. (1995) find that channel members who are heavily dependent on each other may have their relationship quality improved after the destructive act, and performance may even improve as a result. On the contrary, if the power structure is asymmetric or one member depends heavily on the other to realize its objectives, then the less powerful side is unlikely to use responses that may upset the relationship (Kumar et al., 1998). Furthermore, they may perceive that retaliation is ineffective against the powerful partner, because the latter can afford to ignore them (Hibbard et al., 2001). Therefore, weak agents in situations of power asymmetry may have to respond more passively, hoping that conditions would improve (Frazier et al., 1989). In the case of the hotel industry, hotels still find agents useful for distributing their rooms because online booking remains new to a lot of travelers in Hong Kong, even though there are an increasing number of people who are willing to buy goods and services on the Internet. Hence, to a certain extent, both parties are still dependent on each other for profit. This explains why hotels kept on explaining to agents that the destructive act was only a promotional tactic, and that travelers booking on the web belong to a different market segment.",

A search good can be objectively evaluated from externally provided information that is readily available, but an experience good needs to be personally tried and inspected. Peterson et al. (1997) suggest that for search goods the Internet could serve significant transaction and communication functions because the buyer does not need to try and inspect the good before placing an order. Nowadays, secured payment mechanisms are available for web transactions, and the web can also present promotion-type pictures and information interactively that far transcend largely verbal descriptions provided by staff in retail channels.

For example, both Rosenbluth and American Express sell a range of customizable packages that help clients to make the best use of their shrinking travel budgets. Another alternative is to come up with a totally different business model that adds value to a traveler's traveling experience. Providing travel advice, enhancing customer satisfaction and bundling hotel booking with other related services are just some of the many options travel agents need to consider to fight this trend of disintermediation.

They must recognize each key customer's individual preferences and make extraordinary efforts to satisfy these preferences. They may need to target difficult to satisfy customers who are willing to pay more for highly customized services instead of backpackers who prefer cheap rooms booked in a hotel's web site. They need to look into what had to be done and create the organizational capacities to deliver on the commitment to personalized service, the latter include decisions on what services should be offered, what processes are needed, and what staff need to do or learn to make the process work flawlessly.

These variables include performance, perceptions of relationship quality, dependence, and attributional tendencies. This would enable the hotel to identify agents who would potentially react positively to destructive acts so that hotels could direct destructive acts only to agents who tend to attribute these acts to external competition and hostile business environment factors, or to those who are very dependent on the hotel for profit. These agents would normally react with constructive discussion that might eventually foster the level of trust and communication between the parties.",

If a hotel recognizes that an action is destructive to its agent, the hotel should proactively articulate a perceived or actual outside threat to enhance an agent's attributions to external factors. For example, hotels could stress the threat of drastic decrease in travelers to make the agents attribute any commission cut to the September 11 attacks or the recent SARS outbreak. That is, hotels must estimate likely reactions of its agents before a destructive act, and use their predictions to forewarn, justify, or compensate existing agents for potential losses by honestly communicating the message to them as early as possible. To justify a destructive act, a hotel should also share important market data with the agent and explain why the destructive act is necessary (Folger and Skarlicki, 1998; Hibbard et al., 2001).",
