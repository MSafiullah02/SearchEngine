Tests of lung function in both uncomplicated P. falciparum and P. vivax malaria have demonstrated a decrease in diffusion capacity which has been attributed to a reduction in the pulmonary capillary vascular component of gas transfer\n[4]. Following treatment, gas transfer is progressively reduced due to interstitial and alveolar oedema and is more prominent in P. vivax compared with P. falciparum infection. Sequestration of P. vivax in human lung tissue has not yet been shown, suggesting non-sequestering mechanisms for acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), such as soluble mediators causing endothelial damage, hypoxia and systemic shock, resulting in diffuse alveolar-capillary damage\n[5,6]. Reported in this manuscript is a case of ARDS commencing on day 3 into treatment for uncomplicated P. vivax infection when the patient appeared to be in the recovery phase of the illness.",

In a broad review of the clinical spectrum or P. vivax, ARDS as a single complication has been reported in low numbers over the last 20 years, mainly from high income, non-endemic countries with a low case fatality rate. This is contrary to much higher rates (case fatality rate of 50-67%) from more recent reports from endemic countries of severe vivax with ARDS occurring as part of multiple organ dysfunction/failure\n[15]. The risk of ARDS in relation to uncomplicated P. vivax has not been quantified, while for P. falciparum it has been estimated to be 0.1% (three in 3,300) US Army soldiers in Vietnam\n[16].",

Since then and until the patient in this case died, there were 48,983 prospectively followed pregnancies with a known outcome (birth or miscarriage) and 12 P. falciparum and one P .vivax (the case in point) related maternal deaths, with each species accounting for one ARDS death. Amongst this cohort of pregnant women, malaria screening detected at least one episode of P. falciparum or P. vivax in 4,158 and 4,298 women, respectively. Assuming the case in point was caused by P. vivax the comparative rates of malaria-related mortality were: P. falciparum 2.89 per 1,000 (12/4,158) and P. vivax 0.23 per 1,000 (1/4,298), P = 0.003; whereas the ARDS-related malaria mortality was not significantly different for P. falciparum 0.24 per 1,000 (1/4,158) and for P. vivax and 0.23 per 1,000 (1/4,298) P = 1.000.",

The patient was in late pregnancy, symptomatic, moderately anaemic with known \u03b2-thalassaemia trait and with a relatively high P. vivax parasitaemia. She was treated for uncomplicated malaria infection, took oral artemisinin-based anti-malarials and appeared to be recovering well. Unexpectedly ARDS developed on day 3 after treatment was completed and when trophozoites were no longer detectable on the peripheral blood smear. Although ventilated, she died from complications of ventilation. While no other cause for ARDS was diagnosed in this patient, she did have a low body weight and without autopsy an underlying condition cannot be completely ruled out. While most P. vivax-associated ARDS cases reported in the literature have recovered, they were not pregnant. This case of ARDS-associated mortality may have been related to the original P. vivax infection but this cannot be proven. If it is assumed that the patient\u2019s cause of death was caused by P. vivax-associated ARDS, then the risk of ARDS-related maternal mortality in this setting was similar for P. falciparum and P. vivax infection, contrary to malaria-related mortality which was more than 12-fold higher with P. falciparum.",
