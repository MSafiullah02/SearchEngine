            "text": "This event is considered a disaster, still unfolding, initiated from a political decision to save money, and ending up with acute and chronic illnesses and deaths to residents of a Michigan city, as well as high system remediation and health-related costs to the taxpayer. On April 24, 2014, Flint, Genesee County, Michigan, switched its water supply from Detroit\u2019s system to the Flint River as a cost-saving measure for the struggling, majority-black city on the recommendation of the state-appointed emergency manager. Flint agreed to separate from the Detroit Water and Sewerage Department and go with the Karegnondi Water Authority, including the decision to pump Flint River water. This was to be an interim measure until a new pipeline from Lake Huron was constructed in 2016 to serve the region. Soon after the switch, residents begin to complain about the water\u2019s color, taste and odor, and to report rashes and concerns about bacteria. In August and September 2014 city officials issued boil-water advisories after coliform bacteria were detected in tap water. In October 2014, the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (MDEQ) blamed the cold weather, aging pipes and a population decline. In the same month a General Motors plant in Flint stopped using municipal water, saying it was rusting car parts. On January 4, 2015, the city announced that Flint\u2019s water contained a high level of trihalomethanes, a byproduct from increased disinfection by the city. Though this is in violation of the Safe Drinking Water Act, officials told residents with normal immune systems that they have nothing to worry about. In January 2015, Detroit\u2019s water system offered to reconnect to Flint, waiving a $4 million connection fee but the offer was declined by the emergency manager. By February, State officials continued to play down any water problems saying that the water was not an imminent \u201cthreat to public health.\u201d On February 18, 104 parts per billion (ppb) of lead were detected in drinking water at a Flint home and the federal Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) was notified. The EPA does not require action until levels reach 15 parts per billion, but science indicates that there is no safe level for lead in potable water. Officials from EPA and MDEQ discussed the lead level in the sample, and EPA found that the State was testing the water in a way that could profoundly understate the lead levels. On March 3, 2015, a second testing detected 397 ppb of lead in Flint drinking water. A consultant group hired by Flint, reported that the city\u2019s water met state and federal standards, and it did not specifically report on any lead levels. In May, tests revealed high lead levels in two more homes in Flint. In July, an EPA administrator told Flint\u2019s mayor that \u201cit would be premature to draw any conclusions\u201d based on a leaked internal EPA memo regarding lead. However, in September, Flint was asked to stop using the Flint water supply or consider corrosion control for it, because it was causing lead to leach from the water pipes and children had high levels in their blood. State regulators insisted the water was safe. Nevertheless, on October 1, the Governor of Michigan ordered the distribution of filters, the testing of water in schools, and the expansion of water and blood testing after a briefing on the lead problems with the MDEQ and federal officials. At the same time, Flint city officials urged residents to stop drinking water. On October 16, Flint reconnected to Detroit\u2019s water system, and residents were advised not to use unfiltered tap water for drinking, cooking or bathing. On October 19, the Director of MDEQ reported that his staff had used inappropriate federal protocol for corrosion control, and soon after, the Governor announced that an independent advisory task force would review water use and testing in Flint. On December 9 Flint added additional corrosion controls, and soon after an emergency was declared. At the end of December, the task force found that the MDEQ was accountable for its lack of appropriate action, and the Director resigned. On January 16, 2016, the Governor asked the National Guard to distribute bottled water and filters in Flint, and President Obama declared a state of emergency in the city and surrounding county, allowing the Federal Emergency Management Agency to provide up to $5 million in aid.",

            "text": "Three days earlier the crisis expanded to include Legionnaires\u2019 disease, because of a spike in cases, including ten deaths, after the city started using river water. On January 21, the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services stated it did not have enough information to conclude that the increase in cases was related to the ongoing Flint water crisis, although the. head of Michigan\u2019s Communicable Disease Division had said three months earlier that the number of Legionella cases at that time \u201clikely represents the tip of the iceberg.\u201d As of February 2016, the number of reported cases was close to 100. A Flint hospital official was surprised that Michigan and local health agencies did not inform the public about the Legionnaires\u2019 outbreak in Genesee County in 2014\u201315 until January 13; the hospital earlier had spent more than $300,000 on a water treatment system and bought bottled water for patients. The source of Legionella is not known but it was likely in the Flint River, and possibly extensive flushing of Flint\u2019s colored water, which had undesirable odors and tastes, by residents may have caused chlorine residual in the pipes to be washed away, leaving the pipes susceptible to growth of the Legionella; in addition, aerosols from the extensive flushing from turned-on faucets might have led to close contact between the residents and the pathogen. The investigation of the cause of the illnesses continues with criminal charges laid against Michigan departmental employees.",

To be most effective, have this number monitored 24/7 by staff or an answering service. If possible, the utilization of social media such as Facebook or Twitter should be considered and monitored as many large municipalities (including drinking water utilities) and recreational facilities have an Internet presence. If your agency has social media accounts, consider using this vehicle to further disseminate information regarding waterborne illness clusters or outbreaks. Identify medical care facilities and practitioners and seek their participation. Direct educational activities, such as newsletters and talks at meetings, to stimulate participation in the program. Encourage water treatment utilities and operators of recreational water sites to report suspected complaints of waterborne illness to the appropriate local agencies. Also, encourage private and hospital laboratories to report isolations of parasitic agents (e.g., Giardia, Cryptosporidium), viruses (e.g., norovirus and hepatitis A virus), bacteria (e.g., E. coli (pathogenic), Salmonella, Shigella, Vibrio cholerae), and other agents that may be waterborne. Develop a protocol for notification and coordination with agencies that might cooperate in investigational activities, including 24-h-a-day, 7-days-a-week contacts. A comprehensive contact list should be constructed and updated at least twice a year as individuals may change. Notify and coordinate with state/provincial or district agencies, national agencies that have surveillance and water regulatory responsibilities, and other national and international health agencies, as appropriate. For example, it may be useful to find out the level of participation within a certain jurisdiction in national-level outbreak surveillance programs such as NORS (CDC, 2015) or other national surveillance system.",

For community and non-community supplies in which chlorine is already used, increasing the chlorine dosage and opening hydrants and taps to draw the super-chlorinated water through the whole system might be an option. Increasing chlorine is sometimes not effective because the chlorine contact time is too short or super-chlorinated water does not reach some parts of the system.

The city has a large and complex catchment with nine major dams and several storage reservoirs. About 21,000 km of water main, almost 200 pumping stations and many tunnels deliver water from four main river systems. The water is filtered through eleven treatment plants. Seven are owned by Sydney Water and four are privately owned. These plants provide 90% of Sydney\u2019s drinking water and one plant, Prospect, provides up to 80%. In 1998, the quality of Sydney\u2019s drinking water came under acute review when Giardia and Cryptosporidium were found in the city\u2019s main water supply at the Warragamba Dam. Initially, low levels of these parasites were first detected in the water supply on 21 July, but these were within the acceptable health limits. In days following, much higher levels were recorded, and on July 27 the first \u201cboil water\u201d alert (in which residents were instructed to boil their tap water before use) was declared for the eastern Central Business District of Sydney. However, by late on July 29 high readings were found in samples at the Prospect Filtration Plant, in a reservoir and at a location further down the system, and a \u201cboil water\u201d alert was issued for the south of Sydney Harbour, and on July 30 a Sydney-wide \u201cboil water\u201d alert was issued affecting most of Sydney\u2019s residents. On August 4 the warning was discontinued. However, high levels were again found on August 13 (the second event), although it was believed that most organisms would likely be dead. More positive readings were found on August 14, although at lower levels. Further contamination was identified on August 24 and an extended boil water alert was again declared. This was progressively lifted suburb by suburb until further contamination was reported on September 5 (the third event). A 2-week alert was then instituted, which was finally lifted on September 19. It was determined that the parasitic contamination was caused by low-quality surface water entering the dam. This contaminated source was attributed to moderate rainfall in July, followed by heavy rainfall in August and September which caused intermittent supplies of the raw water to enter the dam. Despite high levels of Cryptosporidium (up to >12,000 oocysts) and Giardia (up to >7600 cysts) being recorded in July and August, 1998, no increase in human cryptosporidiosis or giardiasis was detected in the exposed population.",

The economic and political repercussions were extensive. The cost of the crisis to Sydney Water was estimated at A$33 million which included $20 million paid in rebates to customers, $13 million in lost revenue, water testing and staff costs and at least $2.5 million for damages claims. These costs exclude those relating to improvements to the system and infrastructure. The lack of cases of cryptosporidiosis, giardiasis or other water-related health problems led to suggestions that the parasites were either not an infectious type, or not as extensively distributed. An inquiry after the event revealed the publicity as an exaggeration of fact, with Australian Water Technologies, part of Sydney Water, severely overestimating levels of Cryptosporidium and Giardia present in the water, with the recorded levels exposed to consumers as not harmful to human health. The handling of the crisis by State-owned Sydney Water was heavily criticized, causing the resignation of both the chairman and the managing director, and bringing up issues of private vs. public ownership and scientific uncertainty. The eventual consequence of the State Inquiry was the establishment of the Sydney Catchment Authority in 1999 to assume control of Sydney\u2019s catchments and dams, while Sydney Water maintained responsibility for water treatment and distribution and for sewage collection, treatment and disposal.",

            "text": "In May, 2000, many people in Walkerton, a small Ontario, Canada, community of about 5,000 people, began to simultaneously experience bloody diarrhea and other gastrointestinal infections. On May 8\u201312, torrential rain had unknowingly contaminated the town\u2019s water system, but operators failed to check residual levels for a period of several days, allowing unchlorinated water to enter the distribution system. However, the privately-owned Walkerton Public Utilities Commission insisted there was no problem with the water despite other laboratory tests showing evidence of E. coli contamination. Illnesses began about May 18, with the first death occurring on May 22 and the seventh and last on May 30. By May 21, however, many more cases had been diagnosed, the infectious agent determined to be E. coli O157:H7, and contaminated well water was confirmed as the source of the E. coli; all this allowed the region\u2019s Medical Officer of Health to issue a boil water advisory, warning residents not to drink the tap water. Two days later, laboratory results identified the presence of Campylobacter and E. coli O151:H7 and DNA testing showed that the contaminating source was a cattle farm a short distance from a well used for the water supply. By the time the outbreak was over, >2300 were ill and 7 had died. The people who died directly from drinking the E. coli-contaminated water might have been saved if the Walkerton Public Utilities Commission had admitted to contaminated water sooner. Those in charge of the water utilities at the Commission had no formal training in their positions, retaining their jobs through three decades of on-the-job experience. They were later found to fail to use adequate doses of chlorine, fail to monitor chlorine residuals daily, make false entries about residuals in daily operating records, and misstate the locations at which microbiological samples were taken. Regulations state that water suppliers are required to treat groundwater with chlorine to sufficiently neutralize contaminants and sustain a chlorine residual of 0.5 mg/L of water after 15 min of contact. Had utility operators adhered to the protocol, the disaster most likely would have been averted. The operators knew that these practices were unacceptable and contrary to Ministry of Environment guidelines and directives; they eventually admitted falsifying reports and were sentenced to short jail terms. The Ontario government was also blamed for not regulating water quality and not enforcing the guidelines that had been in place. The water testing had been privatized in October 1996. An enquiry found that the water supply, drawn from groundwater, became contaminated with the E. coli O157:H7 strain from manure from cattle on a farm washing into a shallow water supply well after heavy rainfall. The risk of contamination from farm runoff into the adjacent water well had been known since 1978. Key recommendations from the enquiry included source water protection as part of a comprehensive multi-barrier approach, the training and certification of operators, a quality management system for water suppliers, and more competent enforcement, which were incorporated into Ontario new legislation. The bottom line of the enquiry was that officials and municipal water facilities operators and managers across North America need to recognize public waters are a most valued but vulnerable public resource. Investment in keeping them safe and secure needs to be a community top priority.",

Water used during production, including irrigation, pesticides and fertilizers application and washing, frost protection, harvesting, has long been recognized by food safety scientists as one of plausible and probable sources of the contamination of fresh fruits and vegetables. There have been many outbreaks from produce traced to pathogens being introduced by contaminated irrigation water. Although harvested products are sometimes washed with chlorine solution, pathogens may still survive the process through internalization. E. coli O157:H7 may migrate to internal locations in plant tissue and be protected from the action of sanitizing agents by virtue of its inaccessibility. Experiments have also demonstrated that E. coli O157:H7 can enter the lettuce plant through the root system and migrate throughout the edible portion of the plant. However, this claim has been refuted by others. Salmonella and E. coli can also adhere to the surface of plants, and enter through stomata, stem and bud scars and breaks in the plant surface caused by harvesting and processing. Water containing bacteria can be drawn into the produce if it is immersed in or sprayed with water that is colder than the produce itself. E. coli O157:H7 may also use its flagella to penetrate the plant cell walls and attached to the inside of the plant. Once attached, it may be able to grow and colonize the surface of the plant.

The use of the denominator is vital for most calculations. Caution: Numerous other factors may also explain the outbreak and these should be carefully examined. For example, the households using the Bravo supply may be closer to an unhygienic corner store, drink from a cross-connected public water fountain, or their children may swim in a more polluted pond than the other communities.

As an example, consider an outbreak where everyone consumed only one of two possible types of bottled water. One source, A, contains a pathogen, and B does not.

Fourthly, recovery efficiencies are often poor because microorganisms are stressed by disinfectants or the method is sensitive to interferences from the source waters environment, hence not easily recovered by routine methods. Additionally, recovery efficiencies for viruses and protozoa may be poor because of the interferences of substances within the sample matrix with method reagents (concentrating 1800 L of water down to 200 \u03bcL will also concentrate inhibitory chemicals and substances).

Increase each cell of the pair with the higher product and decrease each cell of the pair with the smaller product, while keeping all marginal totals unchanged.The final P is an \u201cexact\u201d P (probability) and may be reported as such (P = 0.0047). In this example, it is also <0.005 of course, and can be reported in this way if preferred.The Fisher\u2019s test is used when the Chi-Square test is invalid due to any \u201cE\u201d values <5 in a 2 \u00d7 2 table. In all other circumstances, Chi-Sq. is an excellent approximation for the FE test.If original data include a zero in one of the cells, you will calculate only one P value. (The O.R. will be reported as \u201cundefinable\u201d but the direction of the effect will be very clear).This P is calculated for a one-tailed FE test. It is adequate for this application. Two-tailed FE test will require further calculation.Should a relationship NOT meet the critical value for significance (that is, P > 0.05), it is described as \u201cnot statistically significant\u201d. Note that a relationship may be observed, but this result is telling you that it could have occurred by chance alone more than 5% of time if you were to repeat the analysis. That may still require further investigation, but from a statistical standpoint, it cannot be claimed as a statistically significant relationship.\n",
