Recruitment was progressive over 2\u2010years at two metropolitan hospitals (one private and one government\u2010funded). To be eligible to participate, children needed to be healthy, without congenital abnormalities or underlying chronic disorders, and to be born at term (36\u201042 weeks gestation). Participants were able to leave the study temporarily (such as during family holidays) and re\u2010join at a later date. The primary aim of the ORChID study was to describe the nature and timing of viral respiratory and gastrointestinal infections during the first 2\u2010years of life.6, 7, 8 Here, we undertook a secondary analysis of the ORChID database and sample bank to evaluate bacterial carriage.

A final multivariable model was constructed with age (in 4 categories), sex and the variables with consistent differences in univariable analysis (smoking, siblings, maternal education, childcare, season) included as covariables.

Nevertheless, the concomitant carriage was especially striking for H. influenzae, which was detected alone in only a very small proportion of samples.

            "text": "There are, however, important limitations to consider. We did not validate upper airway bacterial detection by nasal swab and PCR against the gold standard of NPS culture. However, our current analyses using previously validated PCR targets resulted in expected bacterial prevalence rates. The specificity of the PCR assays are high, yet the ply\u2010PCR may cross\u2010react with oral streptococci.36 We therefore re\u2010analyzed 34 ply\u2010PCR positives with lytA PCR, of which 31 (91%) remained positive (data not shown). Differentiating between H. influenzae and the closely related respiratory tract commensal, H. haemolyticus can also be difficult, although the latter is uncommonly detected in the nasal cavity and the hpd#3 target gene in our PCR assay is both sensitive and specific for differentiating between the two species.17, 37 Storing nasal swabs in the refrigerator and sending by mail before freezing 4 to 11\u2010days post\u2010sampling results in a 10\u201013% decrease in sensitivity for detecting bacteria by PCR, with some variation according to the bacterial species.11 However, in our study transport times were much shorter (median 3\u2010days, interquartile range, 2\u20104). Another limitation is that the assays lacked serotype/genotype determination for the bacterial detections. Evaluating bacterial species only, underestimates acquisition rates by different bacterial subtypes. Therefore, in the current analysis we focused upon the prevalence when evaluating the overall burden of bacterial carriage in young children. Finally, the ORChID study was conducted in one major subtropical city in Australia and as often occurs with studies of this nature involved smaller, socially\u2010advantaged families. Nonetheless, the findings are valid and prevalence of bacterial detection agrees with cohort studies from other settings18, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24 as do the rates of ARI and virus detection.7, 9\n",
