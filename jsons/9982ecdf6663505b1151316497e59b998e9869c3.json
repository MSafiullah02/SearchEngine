            "text": "Human metapneumovirus (hMPV), a condition recently described in the Netherlands, causes lower respiratory infections, particularly in young children and among the elderly. The objective of this study was to describe the characteristics of hMPV infections in hospitalized infants <2 years of age and to compare them to those of infections caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). A prospective study was conducted on the clinical characteristics of infants admitted to hospital for respiratory infection through 5 years. Simultaneous detection of influenza A, B, and C viruses, RSV, and adenoviruses was performed in clinical samples by multiple reverse transcription nested-PCR assay. The presence of hMPV was tested in all samples using two separate RT-PCR tests. Some respiratory virus was detected in 70.5% of the 1,322 children included in the study. hMPV was found in 101 of the positive nasopharyngeal aspirates (10.8%), and was the most common virus after RSV and rhinovirus. Peak incidence was found in March. Over 80% of children were <12 months. The more common diagnoses were bronchiolitis (49.5%) and recurrent wheezing (45.5%). Fifty-four percent of cases required oxygen therapy and, one percent, assisted ventilation. Thirty percent were co-infections, with clinical characteristics indistinguishable from single infections. Seventy-one hMPV single infections were compared to 88 RSV single infections. hMPV infections were significantly more frequent than RSV in infants older than 6 months (P \u00bc 0.04). Recurrent wheezing was diagnosed more frequently in hMPV patients (P \u00bc 0.001). All other variables tested were similar, in both groups. hMPV was the third most frequent virus after RSV and rhinovirus in infants <2 years of age, hospitalized for respiratory infection, and was associated with bronchiolitis and recurrent wheezing. hMPV predominantly occurred in spring. Co-infections were frequent and clinically similar to single infections and RSV infections.",

            "text": "Human metapneumovirus (hMPV), recently described in the Netherlands, 1 is a RNA virus belonging to the Paramyxoviridae family, subfamily Pneumovirinae, genus Metapneumovirus. Although hMPV was described only few years ago, a 100% seroprevalence has been found in samples obtained 50 years ago. 1 It is, therefore, believed it has been circulating in humans for over five decades. The difficulties in isolating this type of virus from cell cultures have, possibly, delayed its detection as a common pathogen in children's respiratory infections. Over the past 4 years, this virus has been identified in patients with respiratory disease in many countries, including Canada, 2,3 Finland, 4 United Kingdom, 5 Spain, 6, 7 the United States, 8, 9 or France. 10 hMPV is genetically similar to avian pneumovirus, particularly serotype C. Two main groups A and B have been identified to date. The phylogenetic studies conducted by the Dutch group 11 show a high similarity to the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), with which it shares morphological similarities and similar infective capacity and spectrum of disease. Upper and lower respiratory tract infections, from common colds to pneumonia, are attributed to hMPV, with bronchiolitis being the main clinical sign of primary infection. 10 In addition, it seems to play a significant role in recurrent wheezing episodes in the first years of life. 7 From an epidemiological point of view, hMPVinfection appears seasonal in its behavior, with a pattern similar to that of the RSV infection, though, at present, few prospective studies exist on its year-round behavior.",

Nucleic acids from 200 ml aliquots of original samples were extracted as previously described. 15 For reverse transcription and PCR amplification of the M gene, a commercial kit (Qiagen One-Step RT-PCR Kit, Qiagen, Valencia, CA) was used. A subsequent halfnested PCR reaction was performed, using a total of 2 ml from the first reaction products, which were added to the reaction mixture up to a final volume of 50 ml. The amplified products were analyzed by gel electrophoresis, stained with ethidium bromide, and a 687 bp band was obtained.",

Most studies included hospitalized children; but, although some authors investigated the presence of hMPV in samples from all patients enrolled, 16, 19, [21] [22] [23] [24] others did so only with the negative samples. 6, [8] [9] [10] 25, 26 Another potentially confounding factor is the different ages of the children studied; for, though hMPV can infect children at any age, its highest incidence Mean AE standard deviation. is seen in children under the age of 1. Thus, although some series only included children under 2-3 years old, 6, 16, [19] [20] [21] others included children under 5; 8, 9, 26 others, even reported patients whose ages ranged from 0 to 18. 4,10,23,27 In addition, the seasonality of hMPV infections causes the identification rate of the virus to be very different from some studies to others if complete epidemiological seasons are not studied. Most incidence studies investigating the presence of hMPV, solely in negative samples, reported a lower frequency of hMPV. For instance, 4.4% in children under 5, in an Argentinean series, 26 or 6.6% of children-aged 3 months to 12 years-in the French group. 10 In Spain, Vincente et al. 6 found hMPV in 4.1% of children under 3 years old whose virological study came out negative. Pediatric series, where both positive and negative infant samples were studied, found an hMPV frequency similar to ours. 19, 20, 28 In our study, hMPV presence was investigated in 1,322 infants under 2, hospitalized for respiratory infection over 5 years. Overall frequency was 7.6% and 11% of positive samples. These figures could well be an adequate approximation as to the true prevalence of hMPV for this population. This setting's high hMPV frequency reinforces the need for inclusion of hMPV detection processes in the diagnostic routine for respiratory infections, in hospitalized infants, given that hMPV appears to play a more significant role than adenoviruses and influenza or parainfluenza viruses, in this age group.",

Interestingly, in the French, 10 Dutch 16 , and Norwegian 23 series, hMPV prevalence occurred mainly in December and January, as did RSV. Given that complete epidemiological seasons were not included in some of these studies, a degree of caution would appear to be in order, when interpreting these results. Potentially, however, this data could reflect the varied nature of hMPV circulation in different countries.",

Our data suggest that hMPV-related diseases, in infants, are more frequent in those aged <12 months, who, in turn, represent over 80% of our inpatients. From our results, we are able to determine that clinical affectation in infants, under 6 months, is less severe than in older children. Most cases were associated with bronchiolitis or recurrent wheezing. Although the study conducted by Rawlinson et al. 31 attributed a limited role to hMPV in asthma exacerbations in children, other studies found that hMPV was related to asthma exacerbations and wheezing in the pediatric population. 4, 23, 27, 32, 33 Our data clearly indicates that hMPV is associated with recurrent wheezing, certainly in hospitalized children aged <2.",

True hMPV-frequency may be underestimated if its presence is studied only in samples testing negative for other respiratory viruses. This is probably one of the most important factors in explaining the varied hMPV-incidence rates seen in very similar populations. 6, 7 The role of hMPV as a concomitant pathogen in these dual infections has not yet been fully established. Some studies, such as those by Greensill et al., 36 K\u00f6nig et al. 34 , and Semple et al. 37 suggest greater severity of coinfections. However, other series did not report severity differences between co-infections and single infections. 25, 28 In our series, there were no significant differences in diagnosis, oxygen-therapy requirements, length of hospital stay, fever frequency, antibiotic therapy, or in radiological changes, between co-infections and single infections. All of which would appear to suggest that the presence of hMPV in the setting of another viral respiratory infection does not make the condition more severe. However, the role of co-infections in the most severe disease could not clearly be evaluated in our study, seeing as only one patient required assisted ventilation.",

            "text": "A comparative analysis of clinical characteristics in hMPV and RSV single infections suggests that hMPV infections are more frequent in infants over 6 months, compared to RSV. Almost all children suffered fewer respiratory infections, yet recurrent wheezing was diagnosed significantly more frequently in the hMPV group, whereas bronchiolitis was the most common diagnosis in the RSV group. The severity of the disease associated with both viruses was similar, and no differences could be shown either in terms of length of hospital stay, oxygentherapy requirements, and fever frequency, nor in the patient's prematurity or underlying disease history. 19, 30, 38 In conclusion, our study supports both the epidemic nature of hMPVinfection and its significant role as a major pathogen in RTI, in infants under the age of 2. Results obtained to date, lead us to recommending that hMPV be taken into account in the differential diagnosis of acute respiratory infections in hospitalized infants, principally, to ensure that they are distinguished from respiratory syncytial-virus infections.
