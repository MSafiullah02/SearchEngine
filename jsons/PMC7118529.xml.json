Once a study (image files in JPEG format or cine clips in MP4 format) was submitted, the coordinator assigned a case number and posted images to the ISRCC private WhatsApp group. Then, one of the available volunteers generated a report using a standard format as a comment on the post [7]. Access to the private group was strictly limited to the coordinator and volunteer radiologists, who were instructed to access information on their password-protected devices to ensure the confidentiality of information. Disagreements on specific cases were resolved by consensus agreement through radiologists\u2019 discussions in the same post. Participation of expert radiologists in different time zones allowed efficient time coverage for reviewing submitted images.

We realize that using a broader definition of infection to include all positive cases on chest CT will result in a higher number of false-positive cases. We acknowledge the potential overlap of CT imaging features between COVID-19 infection and other viral pneumonia. Nonetheless, our priority was to identify the majority of suspicious cases on chest CT and use rRT-PCR testing in a more selective fashion to minimize resource drain. It is imperative that CT findings should be interpreted in the context of positive exposure history and clinical symptoms, especially in epidemic areas with high pretest probability for disease. Although we were able to meet the current need using 11 volunteers, the increased demand for thoracic radiology expertise might exceed the capacity of traditional or even social media\u2013delivered teleradiology services as the volunteers\u2019 home countries experience an influx of diagnostic cases and are themselves subject to infection. Despite the advantages of use of social media, we are aware of disadvantages in health care settings with respect to data security and privacy protection, and usage requires meticulous and adequate training of clinicians, radiologists, and staff.",
