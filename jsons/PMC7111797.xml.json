Coronaviruses are enveloped viruses with positive sense, 5\u2032 capped and 3\u2032 polyadenylated RNA genomes, that range from 27.6 to 32 kb (Lai and Cavanagh, 1997). Two thirds of the coronavirus genome encodes the replicase activity, including a viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), helicase, and viral proteinases. The remaining one third of the genome encodes the structural proteins and small group-specific ORFs (Lai and Cavanagh, 1997).",

The group I coronaviruses include human coronavirus 229E, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), feline coronavirus, and feline infectious peritonitis virus. The group II coronaviruses include human coronavirus OC43, murine hepatitis virus (MHV), and bovine coronavirus. IBV belongs to the group III coronaviruses, all of which are avian specific. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS CoV) respiratory disease in humans that resembles IBV in poultry may be distantly related to group II coronaviruses (Snijder et al., 2003, Stavrinides and Guttman, 2004). Coronavirus genomes also encode group-specific ORF that have been reported to express in infected cells (Lai and Cavanagh, 1997, Liu and Inglis, 1992, Liu et al., 1991). Functions of these genes are not well understood, however, deletion of combinations of several group-specific genes in MHV resulted in in vivo attenuation (de Haan et al., 2002). Although the functions of the four IBV group-specific ORF, 3a, 3b, 5a, and 5b are not known, a Vero cell passaged IBV mutant with a truncated 3b was viable in vitro and in vivo (Shen et al., 2003).",

Bacterial artificial chromosomes (BAC) and vaccinia virus vectors, both of which can accommodate the large coronavirus genomes, have been utilized to carry a full-length cDNA clone of the genome (Almazan et al., 2000, Casais et al., 2001, Gonzalez et al., 2002, Thiel et al., 2001). A third system relied on the in vitro assembly of a modest number of cloned cDNAs. Instead of cloning the entire genome of TGEV into vectors, Yount et al. (2000) amplified the viral genome into several fragments by RT-PCR and the cloned amplicons were ligated through unique restriction sites for in vitro assembly of the entire genome. This strategy was further modified to construct an infectious cDNA clone of MHV with their \u201cno see'm\u201d technology, in which restriction endonuclease sequences were incorporated into amplicons, such that upon enzyme treatment, the endonuclease sites were eliminated prior to in vitro ligation. The assembled cDNA product was used as template for in vitro transcription to generate genomic RNA (Yount et al., 2002). More recently, this strategy was used to construct a reverse genetic system for the SARS CoV (Yount et al., 2003).",

Five RT-PCR fragments were produced that cumulatively amplified the entire genome of the Vero cell adapted Beaudette IBV strain. Amplicons, overlapping by about 10 nucleotides, were designated A through E and the fragment lengths were as follows; A, 2269 nts; B, 6356 nts; C, 6895 nts; D, 5030 nts; and E, 7058 nts (Fig. 1B). However, consistent with the report that these regions were toxic or unstable in bacteria, difficulties arose in cloning the B and C fragments into bacterial plasmid based cloning vectors (Casais et al., 2001). Therefore, the B and C fragments were each cloned as two smaller fragments B1 and B2, and C1 and C2. Fragments A through C2 were cloned into the pSMART vector and fragments D through E2 were cloned into pCR-XL-TOPO cloning vectors. In order to determine the consensus sequence of the genome, two to five independent clones of each amplicon were sequenced using a panel of internal primers. Clones with consensus sequences were used for in vitro assembly of full-length cDNA template. There were several sequence differences, distributed throughout the entire genome of IBV, between our standard cell adapted IBV strain and the published Beaudette sequence (Table 1\n). The standard parental strain of IBV Beaudette used for these studies had a five nucleotide insertion at position 25,414 between the M and 5a ORFs, resulting in a genome size of 27,613, instead of 27,608 nt. The sequence differences were confirmed by sequencing three independent clones and direct sequencing of RT-PCR products. A nucleotide insertion was found in an intergenic sequence of our strain compared to the original published sequence. In addition, an E amplicon with a single unique nucleotide change of A to G at position 25,793 nt, resulting in amino acid change from Q to R, was used as a marker for the molecular clone. Full-length cDNA was in vitro assembled with amplicons conforming with our established consensus sequence. To increase full-length in vitro ligation efficiency, ordered ligation reactions were used. The appropriately sized ligation reaction products were purified from 1% agarose gels before further ligating with neighboring inserts (Fig. 1C).",

Although many recombinant viruses have been constructed to express EGFP or GFP without known reports that EGFP is toxic to virus replication, EGFP was shown in at least one study to induce cellular apoptosis (Liu et al., 1999). In the current study, it is possible that infected cells died by apoptosis because of high expression of EGFP prior to producing maximum amounts of virus viral replication. This is consistent with the finding that we could detect expression of EGFP before cells showed CPE. Alternatively, manipulation of ORF 5a could affect ORF 5b expression. It has been assumed that gene 5b is expressed by leaky scanning mechanism (Liu and Inglis, 1992). The EGFP ORF contained an appropriate Kozak sequence and may have reduced the expression of 5b.

However, we do not favor this explanation because, contrary to Fisher et al., we had sufficient expression of EGFP, with recombinant virus during the first several passages, to be easily detectable and no sequence similarity could be identified in or around the deleted region between the IBV TRS and the EGFP gene. Non-homologous recombination events during IBV replication likely accounts for the deletion of a gene, such as EGFP, that is not necessary for the viral replication. It is not clear whether the foreign gene itself or its specific location in the viral genome causes this spontaneous deletion event. Furthermore, we cannot conclude whether deletion of the EGFP gene, under the control of the 5a TRS, is a general phenomenon of recombinant IBV or a result of EGFP toxicity.",

Reverse transcription was performed with Superscript II (Invitrogen) and reverse direction primers P1R, P2R, P3R, BEAUSSR, and GNRT (Table 2\n), containing BsmBI and SapI restriction endonuclease recognition sequences. The IBV sequence, as reported in GenBank (accession number M95169), was used for primer design and nucleotide sequencing. Each DNA fragment was amplified from cDNA templates by PCR using Expand Long polymerase (Boehringer Mannheim Biochemical). In order to transcribe RNA using T7 RNA polymerase, the T7 RNA promoter sequence was incorporated into the T7P1F primer. PCR primer pairs used to amplify genomic regions are listed in Table 2. PCR amplification of cDNA fragments was performed using the following conditions; denaturation at 94 \u00b0C for 2 min, 10 cycles at 94 \u00b0C for 30 s, 55 \u00b0C for 30 s, and 68 \u00b0C for 2\u20136 min depending on the size of the fragment and 18 cycles of 94 \u00b0C for 30 s, 55 \u00b0C for 30 s, and 68 \u00b0C for 2\u20136 min (with an additional 20 s for each subsequent cycle). The PCR products were isolated from agarose gels and cloned into pCR-XL-TOPO (Invitrogen) or pSMART (Lucigen, Middleton, WI) vectors, according to the manufacturer's directions.",
