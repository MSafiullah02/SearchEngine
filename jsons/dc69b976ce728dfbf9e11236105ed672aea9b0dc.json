            "text": "The use of stochastic models to study the dynamics of infectious diseases is an important tool to understand the epidemiological process. For several directly transmitted diseases, reinfection is a relevant process, which can be expressed by endogenous reactivation of the pathogen or by exogenous reinfection due to direct contact with an infected individual (with smaller reinfection rate \u03c3\u03b2 than infection rate \u03b2). In this paper, we examine the stochastic susceptible, infected, recovered, infected (SIRI) model simulating the endogenous reactivation by a spontaneous reaction, while exogenous reinfection by a catalytic reaction. Analyzing the mean-field approximations of a site and pairs of sites, and Monte Carlo (MC) simulations for the particular case of exogenous reinfection, we obtained continuous phase transitions involving endemic, epidemic, and no transmission phases for the simple approach; the approach of pairs is better to describe the phase transition from endemic phase (susceptible, infected, susceptible (SIS)-like model) to epidemic phase (susceptible, infected, and removed or recovered (SIR)-like model) considering the comparison with MC results; the reinfection increases the peaks of outbreaks until the system reaches endemic phase. For the particular case of endogenous reactivation, the approach of pairs leads to a continuous phase transition from endemic phase (SIS-like model) to no transmission phase. Finally, there is no phase transition when both effects are taken into account. We hope the results of this study can be generalized for the susceptible, exposed, infected, and removed or recovered (SEIR E I ) model, for which the state exposed (infected but not infectious), describing more realistically transmitted diseases such as tuberculosis. In future work, we also intend to investigate the effect of network topology on phase transitions when the SIRI model describes both transmitted diseases (\u03c3 < 1) and social contagions (\u03c3 > 1).",

More recently, due to the complex circulation of people around the world, many effects are enlarged, increasing the propagation of transmitted diseases. For instance, the cocirculation of interacting infections [5, 6] is very frequent for transmitted diseases such as tuberculosis and AIDS; the reinfection effect [7] seems to become more relevant for some transmitted diseases such as tuberculosis and viral hepatitis for which patients acquire partial immunity.",

Two complementary approaches add trust to the traditional deterministic models based on population-wide random mixing, leading the models from population level to individual level: the network theory [8] and the stochastic dynamics strictly connected to percolation theory [9] . Recent results indicate that, for scenarios of cooperativity such as in interacting epidemics, hybrid first order transitions may occur on epidemic models in Erd\u00f3s-Renyi networks and on d-dimensional lattices with d 4 but do not occur on d = 2 lattices [10, 11] .

In this work, we analyze a stochastic discrete version [15, 16] of a basic epidemiological model on a lattice with coordination number \u03b6 (\u03b6 = 2 and 4), called the SIRI model (susceptible, infected, recovered, infected) [17] [18] [19] , considering the probability of changing the state of a site i depending on its neighborhood.

In this work, since we are interested in analyzing the effect of reinfection for infectious diseases, whose action is smaller than prime-infection action, we consider a particular case of the stochastic SIRI model, for which the reinfection rate \u03c3\u03b2 is linked to the infection rate \u03b2 and it is smaller, i.e., \u03c3 < 1. Note that, in the context of social networks, it is also interesting to analyze the case \u03c3 > 1 as it was done by us and two coauthors in [17] for \u03b1 = 0.",

In Fig. 2(a) , we show the time series of infected individuals resulting from the numerical integrations of system (8) ; the simulations of SMFA make evident that the reinfection effect increases the size of outbreaks in relation to the SIR model, leading from epidemic to endemic behavior until the limit case of the SIS model. This effect is also observed in Fig. 2(b) resulting from the numerical integrations of system (10) indicating that PMFA of the SIRI model leads to smaller peaks of outbreaks than its SMFA. In general, the threshold value of \u03c3 is smaller for SMFA than for PMFA; for that set Moreover, keeping fixed the reinfection effect of the SIRI model, we choose two non-null values of \u03c3 (\u03c3 = 0.8 and 0.2) for comparison of the threshold value of primary infection rate \u03b2 (set up as the control parameter) as well as the intensity of endemics (for SIS and like-SIS models) for the larger value of \u03c3 and the intensity of outbreak (for SIR and like-SIR models) for the smaller value one. In the first case, looking at the density of infected individuals as the order parameter [see Fig. 3(a) ], we set up that the SIRI model generates stronger endemics than the SIS model. It also presents a smaller threshold value of primary infection parameter \u03b2 than for the SIS model in both cases: SMFA (\u03b2 th = 0.05 in contrast to \u03b2 th = 1 for the SIS model) and PMFA (\u03b2 th = 0.1 in contrast to \u03b2 th = 2 for the SIS model). In the second case for which the density of recovered individuals is the order parameter [see Fig. 3(b) ], the SIRI model presents a smaller threshold value of primary infection parameter \u03b2 than for the SIR model in SMFA (\u03b2 th = 0.4 in contrast to \u03b2 th = 0.5 for the SIR model).",

However, the endemic region is larger for \u03b6 = 4 than for \u03b6 = 2. Still for \u03b1 = 0, another very interesting phase diagram is observed for one-site mean-field approximation since there is a subregion of epidemic phase that coexists with no transmission phase (no transmission due to infection); its endemic region is larger than the endemic region for one-site mean-field approximation.",

The results emphasize that PMFA is much better than SMFA to describe the dynamics of exogenous reinfection, leading to a smaller value of p, that means a larger value of reinfection parameter \u03c3 . Moreover, the arisen comparisons of the SIRI model with the limit cases of SIR and SIS models highlight its richness making evidence of the transition from the epidemic to endemic phases: the reinfection increases the peaks of outbreaks until the system reaches the endemic phase. Besides, it also important that, for a fixed non-null reinfection parameter, for any value of primary infection rate \u03b2, the intensity of the epidemics or endemics is stronger than for the limit cases, and its threshold values \u03b2 th are smaller than its values for the SIS and SIR models.",

For both particular cases of exogenous reinfection and endogenous reactivation, the endemic phase is identified for lower values of both the recovered rate and the net result for reinfection in relation to infection (0 < p < 1/2). The next step, still in the context of stochastic dynamics, consists in adding a latent compartment in the SIRI model called the exposed compartment, for which the individual is infected, but not infectious. In order to describe diseases with latent period in a more realist way, we intend to analyze the susceptible, exposed, infected, and removed or recovered (SEIR I E ) model assuming R \u2192 E transition by exogenous reinfection and R \u2192 I transition by endogenous reactivation. Thus, the SEIR I E model should describe, in a more realistic way, diseases with latency period, such as tuberculosis.",

Therefore, we intend to perform a systematic analysis of the SIRI model, for \u03c3 < 1 and \u03c3 > 1, on networks with different topologies.",
