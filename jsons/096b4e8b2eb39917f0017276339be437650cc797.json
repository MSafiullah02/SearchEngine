We show a good agreement between the reported data and the estimations given by our model. We also study the behavior of the outputs returned by our model when considering incomplete reported data (by truncating them at some dates before and after the peak of daily reported cases). By comparing those results, we can estimate the error produced by the model when identifying the parameters at early stages of the pandemic. Finally, taking into account the advantages of the novelties introduced by our model, we study different scenarios to show how different values of the percentage of detected cases would have changed the global magnitude of COVID-19 in China, which can be of interest for policy makers.",

Other works of our group related with the mathematical modeling of epidemics can be seen on the website https://www.ucm.es/momat/epidemics. In this paper, we have adapted that model to the specific case of COVID-19. Only within-country disease spread is considered in this paper for territories with a relevant number of people infected by COVID-19, where local transmission is the major cause of the disease spread. We point out that, when available, the parameters of the model are taken from the literature (see, e.g. [18, 19] ). Undocumented parameters or specific parameters to our approach are identified by using a multi-objective optimization approach, developed in a previous work (see [7] ). We point out that we use a novel approach that relates the disease fatality rate with the percentage of detected cases over the real total infected cases, which allows to study the importance of this percentage on the impact of COVID-19.",

To do that, it uses two procedures at each iteration: reproduction and replacement. Firstly, the reproduction method applies some classical genetic operators (here: selection, mutation, and crossover) to the population of the previous iteration to obtain a new offspring population. Secondly, the replacement procedure decides which solutions from the previous iteration and the offspring populations should compose the population for the next iteration. The main feature of WASF-GA is that this decision is based on preferences, which are defined as reference values for the objectives. Indeed, it classifies the individuals using an achievement scalarizing function (see [39] ) characterized by the L \u221e distance between the objective function values and the reference values with different weights. The considered sample of weight vectors is built following [39] to ensure they are well distributed. As a result, WASF-GA returns a set of solutions covering a region of the Pareto optimal front.",

In particular, it includes a novel approach that considers the fraction \u03b8 of detected cases over the real total infected cases, which allows to study the importance of this ratio on the impact of COVID-19. We also introduced a method to estimate some of the unknown parameters of this model. Additionally, we proposed the use of a filtered version of the data reported by the WHO, in order to smoothly distribute along the previous dates the sudden increase of 17414 cases reported on 17 February 2020. From a general point of view, the outputs returned by the simulation fit quite well the data reported by the WHO. In particular, they estimated reasonably the date and magnitude of the peaks corresponding to the number of new cases, new deaths and amount of hospitalized people. This indicates that the proposed methodology can be used as an useful decision tool for policy makers. However, considering an estimation performed at an early stage of the epidemic could produce poor results. Focusing on the study of the peaks of some relevant curves of the epidemic (e.g. new exposed people, new cases, new deaths and hospitalized people), results show that the control measures in China were efficient to quickly reduce the magnitude of the epidemic. However, due to the transition rates between the disease compartments, the visible impact for the society has a delay of two weeks after the beginning of those control measures.",
