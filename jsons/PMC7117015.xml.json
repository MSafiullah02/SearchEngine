In this context, a spillover effect refers to the phenomenon in which information about brand A influences a consumer's beliefs regarding brand B, even if the impact is not explicit (Ahluwalia et al., 2001). Previous research has demonstrated the presence of spillover effect within the same brand family or product category (Balachander and Ghose, 2003), across product categories (Erdem, 1998), and from one product attribute to another (Ahluwalia et al., 2001). However, researchers have paid little attention to spillover effect at the firm level, which occurs across companies in the same category. For example, negative publicity regarding an Escherichia coli (E. coli hereafter) scare at Wendy's may negatively affect Jack in the Box, because of the indirect influence of negative publicity and the latter restaurant's prior association with E. coli.",

During rival firms\u2019 crises, competitors can grab more market shares (Tsang, 2000, van Heerde et al., 2007) and increase consumer awareness through aggressive advertising (Dawar, 1998). Roehm and Tybout (2006) also find a negative spillover effect, demonstrating that negative consumer perceptions about one brand can spill over to competing brands in the same product category. Moreover, when a firm A has a crisis history, the advantage of being a competitor during a firm B's (rival firm) crisis may be offset by negative associations between the firm A and a crisis of firm B. In this respect, a rival's product harm crisis may become a threat if the firm is associated with a negative past event.",

Situational crisis communication theory posits that a history of crises becomes an important cue for determining reputational threats to firms (Coombs and Holladay, 2001, Coombs and Holladay, 2002). Moreover, existing information on a past crisis can shape consumers\u2019 perceptions of current crises and influence reputational threats. Thus, a history of crises may amplify reputational threats and harm firms\u2019 financial performance, even long after a crisis outbreak is over. Because 59% of all reported foodborne illness outbreaks in the United States are attributed to the restaurant industry (CDC, 2006), it is critical to investigate possible negative spillovers among restaurant firms. To that end, this study examines how negative spillover from unrelated crises influences a restaurant firm with a history of crisis.",

Those incidents caused illnesses and deaths, resulted in negative consumer perceptions of quality, decreased sales revenues, tarnished firm reputations, and lower marketing efficiency (Dawar and Pillutla, 2000, van Heerde et al., 2007). Coombs (2004) suggested that despite its disastrous results, the unexpected and accidental nature of a crisis can serve as a cushion for affected firms in rebuilding consumer trust. However, empirical evidence shows that the media tend to report on past crises in relation to similar crises for very long time. For example, it is common for E. coli-related media reports to cite Jack in the Box as an example, though the event occurred 18 years ago. Fig. 1\ndisplays the number of news articles containing words \u201cJack in the Box\u201d and \u201cE. coli\u201d using LexisNexis database, evidencing that Jack in the Box still appears in media reporting in relation to E. coli up to present.",

Unfavorable attitudes toward a crisis likely diminish over time; however, a longer period between a crisis and a product recall makes it more difficult for firms to regain consumers\u2019 trust (Standop, 2006). Furthermore, Vassilikopoulou et al. (2009) assert that time significantly influences consumers\u2019 perceptions, attitudes, and intentions. Consumers thus perceive less danger and adopt better impressions and future purchase intentions one year after a crisis, such that time helps reduce the negative effects of a crisis on consumer responses. Crisis managers then may expect to observe a time effect, by which consumers are less likely to recall a past negative event over time. Accordingly, a firm may be able to recover from a crisis. Thus, we hypothesize the time influence on negative spillover effect on Jack in the Box as:H2The negative spillover effect from other firms\u2019 food crises on Jack in the Box is stronger when the negative spillover event is closer in time to the 1993 Jack in the Box E. coli outbreak (1993\u20132003) as compared to a negative spillover event that is farther away in time (2004\u20132010).\n",

            "text": "The accessibility\u2013diagnosticity framework offers a theoretical explanation of this negative spillover effect (Feldman and Lynch, 1988). The framework describes how the negative image of one brand spills over to perceptions of other brands if there is a strong association between them. When consumers consider brand A informative about brand B, its image influences perceptions of brand B. The framework also indicates that product similarity increases diagnosticity and accessibility (Feldman and Lynch, 1988). For example, attribute-level similarities have a greater effect than overall product similarity does on consumer perceptions (Broniarczyk and Alba, 1994, Roehm and Tybout, 2006). Moreover, categorization theory asserts that product similarity provides strong cues for categorization, which lead to higher levels of both diagnosticity and accessibility (Mervis and Rosch, 1981, Sujan, 1985). Resonance theory, which explains cognitive-oriented activities in information processing, indicates that greater correspondence induces a stronger resonance effect (Wan, 2008). It also supports the notion that the spillover effect is promoted by product similarity. Thus, when Lei et al. (2008) examined the effects of the strength and directionality of brand relatedness on spillovers within a brand family, they found that negative spillover within a brand family was stronger and more salient with a higher number of associations. Furthermore, Janakiraman et al. (2009) extended the scope of this research to a product category and tested negative spillover effects on competing brands. They found a moderating effect of product/brand similarity on perception spillovers, revealing that perception spillovers occurred when brands were sufficiently similar. Thus, this study proposes the effect of similarity in terms of operation type and type of foodborne illness on negative spillover effect on Jack in the Box:H3The negative spillover effect from other firms\u2019 food crises on Jack in the Box is stronger when the similarity in terms of type of illness between the two events is greater.\nH4The negative spillover effect from other firms\u2019 food crises on Jack in the Box is stronger when the similarity in terms of type of operation between the two events is greater.\n",

The underlying reasons of increase in product recalls include the globalization of production, the increased complexity of products, and closer attention of firms and government agencies (Berman, 1999). Notable examples of product recalls include Tylenol tampering in 1983, Jack in the Box's recall of contaminated beef in 1993, tire recalls of Firestone in 2000, Chinese milk scandal recalling baby products in 2008, and Toyota's recall of 7 million cars in 2009.

When a firm A deals with a crisis, the event may influence the stock returns of a firm B which is in the same industry with a firm A due to the high correlation that exists between firms in the same industry. The market evaluation of a firm A becomes a determinant of evaluation of a firm B by market investors. In this sense, a recall announcement of a hospitality firm A may become a driver influencing market evaluations of a hospitality firm B especially when the firm B has a past crisis history. Considering the positive effect of recall execution in reducing consumers\u2019 risk perception (Dawar and Pillutla, 2000, Siomkos and Kurzbard, 1994), an announcement of a hospitality firm recalling suspected products may be perceived as positive signal by market investors which may reduce negative spillovers on other hospitality firms. In this sense, the recall execution may become a good news for other hospitality firms because investors perceive less risk with product recalls than without recalls. Thus, this study proposes a hypothesis as:H5The negative spillover effect from other firms\u2019 food crises on Jack in the Box is stronger when there is no recall execution as compared to when there is a recall execution.\n",

It is not desirable to use the method when the event dates are not precise and when events are not price-sensitive because the impacts may not be incorporated into stock prices (Brown and Warner, 1980). In addition, although most event studies rely on parametric test statistics, the parametric tests are considered to lack detailed assumptions about the probability distribution of returns. Instead, the use of non-parametric tests such as sign test and rank test is suggested by Cowan (1992) to ensure the results of parametric test statistics. In order to overcome such shortfalls of using event study method, the current study identifies the event dates using Marler Clark's website while cross-referencing the LexisNexis database. To eliminate the confounding effects, treatments are made as explained in the methodology section. Lastly, both parametric and non-parametric tests are performed to confirm the reported test results as suggested by Peterson (1989).",

(2007) examined the impact of product harm crises on marketing efficiency by using Kraft Food Australia's 1996 salmonella food poisoning case. Rittichainuwat (2006) also used a case study of the tsunami that hit Thailand in 2004 to examine how the tourism industry recovers from natural disasters. In turn, this study examines the negative spillover effects reflected in stock returns due to food crises, using a case study of Jack in the Box, by adopting ESM.",

In January 1993, Jack in the Box suffered a major corporate crisis from an E. coli outbreak that gained tremendous media attention and shocked millions of customers. The Jack in the Box E. coli outbreak remains the largest and deadliest food crisis associated with restaurants. It resulted in the deaths of four children and sickened more than 700 people in multiple states. Jack in the Box lost millions of dollars in sales and revenue as a result of the crisis (Braun-latour et al., 2006). As an effort to recover its brand image and regain consumer confidence, Jack in the Box took several responsive recovery actions, including recalling products, closing restaurants, retraining employees, and conducting several nationwide marketing campaigns (Israeli, 2007). By the mid-1990s, those efforts were largely successful such as increases in sales and revenue, and in 1997, the lawsuits came to a close. In 2004, Jack in the Box became a recipient of the \u201cBlack Pearl\u201d award for innovations in food safety and quality. Accordingly, it is frequently considered a successful case of recovering from a food-related crisis. However, are there possible negative spillovers from other firms\u2019 food crises on Jack in the Box? or did Jack in the Box fully recover from the devastating memory of E. coli?",

In addition, with an estimation window of 275 trading days, or one calendar year, ending 20 days before the event, we calculated market returns using an equal-weighted index (Cowan, 2003).

In the current study, AR is calculated as the average value of JACK's stock prices in response to 73 events. We calculated CAR as the sum of daily ARs (Eq. (5)). For example, CAR 1 is calculated as the sum of AR on day 0 and AR on day 1, CAR 2 is the sum of AR on day 0, AR on day 1, and AR on day 2.

Unlike previous studies using a regression analysis for cross-sectional analysis (Borde et al., 1999, Chang and Zeng, 2011), this study used ANCOVA because of dichotomized nature of testing variables as well as the benefit of ANCOVA in showing the pattern of changes in ARs and CARs over time.

The first news report that covered the E. coli scare associated with Jack in the Box was released on January 18, 1993. Beginning with the first day, we calculated CARs by summing daily ARs. For example, the calculated AR for Jack in the Box was \u22121.9018 for January 18, 1993 (t\n0), and \u221211.6767 for January 19, 1993 (t\n1).

Following the same data collection procedure used for JACK, we obtained historical stock prices for the four restaurant firms from CRSP in line with previous literature (Chen et al., 2009). In order to eliminate the confounding effect, any cases within the period of 10 days before and after foodborne illness outbreaks of Wendy's, Darden, Yum, and McDonald's were removed from data prior to the analysis. Those events include, for instance, foodborne illnesses associated with McDonald's in 1998, Wendy's in 2000, KFC in 2002, Olive Garden in 2005, and Taco Bell in 2006. This elimination enables us to remove the possibility of negative spillover of other firms on themselves regardless of the influence of Jack in the Box. The ARs and CARs of the four restaurant firms (hereafter, OTHER) were calculated using the same event windows to determine whether the changes in ARs and CARs for OTHER differed from those for JACK.

Consumers likely perceive stronger linkages between the current crisis and a past crisis if they are similar, which may result in stronger spillover effects on the firm with a crisis history. Therefore, if a crisis occurs in another firm that is similar to the firm's past crisis, a crisis manager must engage in crisis management efforts.

The positive effect of recall execution provides evidence on the indirect influence of a firm's recall announcement which reduces the negative spillover on other firms. Although the current study did not examined the direct relationship between recall execution and negative spillover, the results of CARs responding to recall execution imply that stock returns are positively influenced by others\u2019 recall announcements. When a hospitality firm announces a recall strategy, the recall is perceived as positive by investors which positively influence the market evaluation of other firms in the hospitality industry. The finding on the effect of recall execution is interesting considering previous literature emphasizing the negative consequences of recall announcement on stock returns (Chen et al., 2009, Thomsen and McKenzie, 2001). Although the recall announcement can threat stock returns of a hospitality firm suffering from their own crisis, the recall can be a positive signal to other firms in the hospitality industry. Given the positive consequences of recall execution, effective communication among hospitality firms during crises becomes more crucial to protect each other during one's crisis.",

For example, with regards to the effect of time, similarity, and recall execution, the differences of CARs between two groups were turned into significant after three to seven days since the outbreak date. Such intensified impact of crises was detected earlier by Chen et al.

In addition, the \u201ctime-lag effect\u201d is often found by finance research due to the time consumed for information dissemination to the public, and more importantly, the time spent to allow influences to be incorporated into stock prices. Considering the presence of time-lag effect caused by other firms\u2019 food crises, the impacts are more likely to gradually spread and amplify.

The major contribution of the study is to uncover the presence of negative spillover effect on hospitality firms with past history, which extends the existing theoretical frameworks on hospitality crisis management. The present study shed lights on the hidden long-term impacts from food crises on hospitality firms by providing empirical results opposing the widely known successful story of Jack in the Box. Whether a firm has a past crisis history is considered a critical factor in Situational crisis communication theory (SCCT), influencing the type of appropriate crisis response strategies (Coombs, 2004). Considering that the SCCT model deals with the crisis of own company, the model can be extended by including factors influencing the negative spillover from others\u2019 crises. Further, the appropriate crisis response strategies to others\u2019 crises can be designed accordingly. Moreover, unlike previous research focusing on short-term impacts of crises, the examination on the long-term impact of crisis enriches the crisis-related hospitality literature. The idea of negative spillover effect in a long-term perspective can be further applied to other crises threatening the hospitality industry such as natural disasters and business fraud. In addition, the magnitude of negative spillover effect may differ depending on the type of crises, which may be a focus for future research.",

To avoid this negative spillover effect, crisis managers should deal appropriately with others\u2019 crises, rather than ignoring them. Restaurant crisis managers should first identify the magnitude of the predicted negative spillover by examining the similarity of the ongoing crisis with their own crisis history, in terms of operation or crisis type. In addition, they should examine the seriousness of the crisis, which could drive negative publicity threatening firms during a time of crises. If a firm has a pre-developed crisis management plan, crisis managers should conduct appropriate crisis management strategies, such as communicating with the media and the public. Because social media has become a key business-to-customer communication tool, crisis managers could consider using this method to avoid possible negative spillovers from others\u2019 food crises. Considering the importance of firms\u2019 responses to crises (Siomkos, 1999, Siomkos and Shrivartara, 1993), performing an immediate crisis response may be a key strategy in successful crisis management.",

Using scenario-based crisis management strategies to train managers may enable restaurant and hotel managers to deal more appropriately with an unexpected crisis. In developing crisis scenarios, case studies may be especially effective as a means to predict diverse crisis situations and suggest appropriate response strategies. For example, Braun-latour et al. (2006) examined the childhood memory-based advertising strategy of Wendy's in responding to a hoax driving negative publicity in 2005. This unique advertising strategy helped it recover from its tainted brand image and might be useful when applied to other restaurant brands that suffer ill effects from rumors, hoaxes, and negative publicity. Chien and Law (2003) also investigated the responses of Hong Kong hotels to the SARS outbreak in March 2003, which provided good examples of appropriate responses by hotels during crises. Case studies offer various examples to use in developing scenario-based crisis management strategies. In this sense, the current study provides essential guidelines for restaurant crisis managers by not only warning of the danger of food crises but also offering response strategies when others experience their own crises.",

Restaurant firms should consider their branding strategy as a marketing tool that can not only increase brand awareness but also protect brands in case of crises (Rao et al., 2004). Although corporate branding can be an effective strategy to facilitate brand awareness, it also can endanger the whole brand family when faced with a crisis. In contrast, using a house-of-brand strategy, which allows sub-brands to use different names than the parent company, may protect members of the brand family when just one of them is involved in a crisis. In this sense, the house-of-brand strategy may be effective in minimizing negative spillover on the entire brand family. For example, in 1993, the parent company of Jack in the Box was Foodmaker, which held several other restaurant brands. Although Jack in the Box's crisis was a severe event, the images of other brands were not negatively influenced, because Foodmaker used the house-of-brand strategy causing weak associations among brands. If the parent company had used a corporate branding strategy, the results of the crisis might have been more severe.",

The enhanced understanding on the impacts of such crises on hospitality industry may help crisis managers design effective crisis communication strategies. In terms of methodology, one method of examining the impact of crises on firms may be a longitudinal study which enables researchers to compare consumers\u2019 intentions before and after the outbreak of crises. Despite the difficulty of conducting a longitudinal study, the method may overcome the limitation of the manipulated nature of scenario-based survey by maximizing the reality of survey. Lastly, although the current study used only one company, Jack in the Box, future studies may select more than one hospitality company that had similar crises in the past. For example, there were a number of hospitality companies suffered from foodborne illnesses such as salmonella and E. coli.

Note: The table shows the significance of difference between ARs and CARs of Jack in the Box and Other restaurant firms (McDonald's Inc., Wendy's Inc., Darden Restaurant Inc., Yum Brands Inc.) to 73 food safety events. As a parametric test, one-way ANOVA was performed to test the difference between Jack in the Box and others. Significant FF value indicates the presence of significant differences between two groups (Jack versus OTHER). Additionally, an analysis comparing Jack in the Box and Wendy's which are relatively similar in firm size is performed because the size of five firms varies considerably. The result of the additional analysis confirms that the negative spillover on Jack in the Box was significantly greater than that on Wendy's. *p < .05, **p < .01, ***p < .001.",
