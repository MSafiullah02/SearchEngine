Although the reduction in the sodium current manifests with characteristic electrocardiographic abnormalities, patients with the Brugada syndrome are often healthy and unaware of their genetic predisposition. As a result, the diagnosis of Brugada syndrome is often made after syncope or aborted sudden cardiac arrest. 4 Fever, alcohol, and medications causing sodium channel blockade are well-described provocative triggers that may incite arrhythmia in patients with Brugada syndrome. 5 Here, we report a novel case of syncope due to Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)-induced fever in a patient with previously unrecognized Brugada syndrome.",

Those with a type 2 Brugada ECG pattern and pertinent clinical features require a class I antiarrhythmic drug challenge to induce a type 1 Brugada ECG pattern in order to meet the diagnosis of Brugada syndrome. 9 Discerning the difference between Brugada syndrome and the Brugada pattern with no relevant clinical features is important for patient management. An implantable cardioverter-defibrillator implantation is a class 1 indication in patients with Brugada syndrome who survived a cardiac arrest and/or who have a history of spontaneous sustained ventricular tachycardia. 9 On the other hand, asymptomatic patients with the Brugada ECG pattern but no clinical signs and family history suggestive of Brugada syndrome do not benefit from a defibrillator. 10 Figure 1 The patient's initial 12-lead electrocardiogram in the emergency department.

In addition to standard isolation procedures for patients diagnosed with COVID-19, those with known or suspected Brugada ECG patterns may warrant more aggressive antipyretic therapy and serial screening ECGs. In addition, when managing a febrile patient with syncope, an ECG must be a part of the evaluation. Defibrillator implantation should be strongly considered in individuals with a provoked type 1 Brugada ECG pattern.",
