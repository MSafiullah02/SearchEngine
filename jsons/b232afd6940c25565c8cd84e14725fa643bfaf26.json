Existing dataset search engines typically rely on matching queries to dataset descriptions. However, a user may not have enough prior knowledge to write a query using terms that match with description text. We propose a novel schema label generation model which generates possible schema labels based on dataset table content. We incorporate the generated schema labels into a mixed ranking model which not only considers the relevance between the query and dataset metadata but also the similarity between the query and generated schema labels. To evaluate our method on real-world datasets, we create a new benchmark specifically for the dataset retrieval task. Experiments show that our approach can effectively improve the precision and NDCG scores of the dataset retrieval task compared with baseline methods. We also test on a collection of Wikipedia tables to show that the features generated from schema labels can improve the unsupervised and supervised web table retrieval task as well.",

While for dataset search, each table has values but may lack high quality dataset descriptions. We believe that our schema label generation method can outperform STR in the scenario where text descriptions provide less useful information than the table itself. We also show unsupervised ranking results with Eq. 4 in Table 4 . Unlike Zhang and Balog [16] , we consider page title, section title and caption as a single text field, in order to reduce the number of hyperparameters (field weights). The results show that generated labels are more effective than original labels for table ranking. It is unsurprising because generated labels often include not only original labels but also additional labels that can benefit the ranking model. We also notice that including the data table field achieves better results than not scoring it, which is contrary to the results of dataset ranking. It is also expected since WikiTables are entity-focused and include a lot of text information while data tables from data.gov include more numeric values.",

The framework has two stages: in the first stage, a schema label generator is trained to generate additional schema labels for each dataset column; in the second stage, given a user query, datasets are ranked by their original fields together with generated schema labels. Schema label generation is treated as a multi-label classification task in which each column of a dataset is associated with multiple schema labels. Instead of using hand-curated features, we learn the latent feature representations of schema labels by a CoFactor model in which the dataset-schema label interactions and schema label-schema label interactions are captured. With the schema label mixed ranking model, the traditional ranking scores for text fields (title, description, data rows) and word embedding-based scores for generated schema labels can be used to rank the datasets.",
