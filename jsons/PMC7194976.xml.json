Based on current data, we estimate that over 80% of identified cases are self-limited mild illness. Severe cases occur largely among those aged over 60, while case-fatality rates are highest among elderly people suffering from co-morbidities.2\n",

All entrants must be assessed based on history of TOCC (travel, occupation, contact, cluster-detailed below).

Contact history must also be taken to identify those who may have visited a hospital or emergency room in the previous two weeks. Finally, in the phase of community circulation, a history of encounters with potential clusters should be identified. Importantly, symptoms of COVID-19 including fever, cough, general malaise, influenza-like illness or diarrhea, loss of taste, and skin rashes are contraindicated and as such, people exhibiting such symptoms should be forbidden entry to the facility.

For example, the clean zone itself is divided into distinct compartments to block the potential spread of SARS-CoV-2 throughout the system (Fig. 1). Compartmentalization can be adapted to specific conditions in each LTCF. For example, while ideally compartmentalization in the clean zone may involve separate buildings, compartmentalization can also occur using different floors within one building, or even distinct wards/blocks on the same floor. Each distinct compartment is staffed by designated staff including a HCW and nurse attendant who do not rotate to other compartments. By remaining in only one compartment, the potential for transmission within the LTCF clean zone and beyond is minimized. Ideally, support staff (including part-time staff working in cleaning, laundry and catering) should also be assigned to only one compartment. However, if staffing is insufficient, support staff should be trained in hand disinfection (to block fomite transmission) in addition to daily environmental cleaning and disinfection to minimize the risk of cross-compartment spread.16\n",
