A search for common respiratory pathogens, including Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, and Coxsackie B-virus specific IgM, yielded negative results. A chest CT scan conducted in another hospital 2 days before revealed the presence of a GGO in the right lung, which required further diagnostic workout (differential diagnosis between a tumor and an infectious disease). 18F-FDG PET/CT identified peripheral GGOs with an increased 18F-FDG uptake (SUVmax range 2.2\u20134.6) in the right upper lung (Fig. 1a, b, arrows) and left lower lung (Fig. 1c; arrows). Unfortunately, SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid testing was not performed. Antiviral, anti-inflammatory, and symptomatic treatment for 2 weeks led to complete resolution of symptoms.",

When compared with previous chest CT results, there was evidence of disease progression as shown by a higher number of lesions, which were also characterized by an increased extent and density. There were also multiple FDG-positive lymph nodes in the mediastinum and right hilar region (SUVmax range 3.8\u20135.5; Fig. 4c, arrows). Real-time fluorescent polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for the detection of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid yielded negative findings in two independent measurements. A follow-up chest CT (February 1, 2020) performed after antiviral and anti-infective treatment revealed a significant improvement in the picture (Fig. 4d).",

Notably, all of these lesions showed a high tracer uptake. Although a bilateral involvement of the lung parenchyma can be observed in several benign and malignant lung diseases [7], tumors presenting as GGOs are unlikely to be FDG-avid [8]. The high tracer uptake that characterized COVID-19 pulmonary infections reflects a significant inflammatory burden, similar to that elicited by the Middle East respiratory syndrome or the H1N1 pandemic influenza virus [9, 10]. Although COVID-19 infections do not seem to be accompanied by lymphadenopathy [6], our 18F-FDG PET/CT findings revealed an increased nodal FDG uptake in three of four cases. Although no obvious nodal enlargement was evident, our imaging data indicate for the first time that COVID-19 may cause lymphadenitis\u2014in line with previous data obtained from non-human primates exposed to MERS-CoV [9]. Another interesting finding is that no disseminated lesions were evident in our patients\u2014suggesting that COVID-19 has pulmonary tropism.",

High rates of false-negative findings may be explained by several reasons, including (1) the lack of SOPs for SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid detection, differences in sample handling, storage, and processing, (2) disease stages and different viral loads according to anatomical site (e.g., alveoli versus upper respiratory tract), (3) the lack of independent validation of current testing, and (4) the potential high mutation rates of COVID-19.
