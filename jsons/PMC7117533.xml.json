            "text": "Feline leukemia virus (FeLV), feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), feline coronavirus (FCoV) and feline parvovirus (FPV) are important viral pathogens of the domestic cat and potentially of all wild felids. FeLV is responsible for a degenerative and proliferative disease leading to death and is transmitted by direct contact (Hartmann, 2011). FIV induces an acquired immunodeficiency syndrome similar to AIDS and is mainly transmitted by bites (Hartmann, 2011). FCoV is a ubiquitous virus transmitted by the fecal\u2013oral route and although associated with a benign enteric disease is also the etiologic agent of feline infectious peritonitis, a severe disease affecting the Felidae (Addie et al., 2003). FPV is responsible for a viral panleukopenia frequently fatal in young kittens (Steinel et al., 2001). Several reports have confirmed that these viruses also infect the European wildcat (Felis silvestris silvestris) (Mill\u00e1n and Rodr\u00edguez, 2009), catalogued as vulnerable in Portugal (Queiroz et al., 2005), and the Iberian lynx (Lynx pardinus) (Meli et al., 2009), the most endangered felid species in the world (IUCN, 2007). Canine distemper virus is an important viral pathogen for members of the Panthera genus (Roelke et al., 2008) as well as to Mustelidae family (Thorne and Williams, 1988). Recently CDV was reported as the etiological agent of encephalitis in lynx (Lynx canadensis) in the USA (Daoust et al., 2009) and was also implicated as probable cause of death in an Iberian lynx in Spain (Meli et al., 2010b).",

In view of future efforts towards conservation of threatened species, namely the reintroduction of L. pardinus, a virological survey was conducted to assess the presence of FeLV, FIV, FCoV, FPV and CDV infections in wildcats and feral cats.

Due to FeLV pathogenesis, detection of antigenemic samples confirmed the presence of the disease in the sampled populations. Considering that this study was performed on an opportunist sample, a bias could have occurred, which would partially explain the high FeLV frequency both in wild (25%) and feral cats (33.3%). Although an uneven distribution of the samples was evident, results indicate a higher frequency of FeLV in feral cats, suggesting that these populations might have a greater responsibility in the spread of the virus in wild populations, contrary to what has been suggested by others (Leutenegger et al., 1999, Mill\u00e1n and Rodr\u00edguez, 2009).",

            "text": "Regarding the prevalence of FeLV and FIV our results showed high frequencies for FeLV (25\u201333.3%) but no occurrence of FIV (0%). FeLV is transmitted by direct contact, mainly by saliva and also by vertical transmission. Caring for offspring and territory marking are behaviors that may favor FeLV transmission in wildcats and feral rural populations. On the other hand FIV is mainly transmitted by bites frequent in territorial struggles and mating, with a direct correlation between the animal's behavior and the prevalence of FIV infection (Ishida et al., 1989). Our samples were collected from wild and rural feral cats roaming over territories which are known to be relatively large in these species (Fernandes, 1992, Monterroso et al., 2009), thus minimizing interactions. Interestingly FeLV infection is more aggressive from the clinical point of view, causing anemia, and a severe immunosuppression rendering the animals more susceptible to secondary infections (Hartmann, 2011). In 2007 an important FeLV outbreak occurred in Donana (Spain) causing the death of several lynxes (Meli et al., 2010a). This disease can be considered to be an important threat to endangered species with small restricted populations. This may already be the case for wildcat populations in certain areas of Portugal and would also apply to lynx nuclei in a future reintroduction scenario. The prevalence found in the present study is an important risk indicator and should be confirmed for local areas with a wider sample. The expected values of the disease can be used to estimate sample size. For instance in Vale do Guadiana, presently a potential area for reintroduction of lynx and where an important wildcat population persists (Monterroso et al., 2009), 35% (7/20) LTE samples were positive for FeLV antigen, a remarkably high value. A previous survey conducted in 2007 in SE Portugal, including Vale do Guadiana and Moura Barrancos with samples from 19 rural domestic cats (Duarte et al., 2007) also revealed 21% FeLV Ag positivity, thus confirming high FeLV frequency in wild and feral feline populations in potential reintroduction areas for L. pardinus, reinforcing the need for a thorough evaluation of disease prevalence.",

Wild cats displayed a higher frequency of FCoV RNA (33.3%) and feral cats of FPV DNA (18.2%), confirming the presence of carrier animals within wild populations as already reported (Leutenegger et al., 1999). Considering the pattern of FCoV infection carrier animals are responsible for viral availability in the environment, leading to exposure of susceptible animals whenever they share the same habitat, potentially constituting a disease threat (Addie et al., 2003). FCoV antibodies were not detected in the sampled population of 26 wild cats, including 3 positive viral RNA samples. This finding may reflect the use of serum and LTE mainly collected from decomposed carcasses for the serological screening, raising the possibility of an underestimated frequency of FCoV Ab due to protein denaturation and low sensitivity of LTE for serological testing (Tryland et al., 2006). On the other hand FCoV tend to establish recurrent infections in the cat and antibody detection does not always correlate with virus shedding neither in carrier animals (Foley et al., 1997), nor in Feline Infectious Peritonitis affected animals (Addie et al., 2009).",
