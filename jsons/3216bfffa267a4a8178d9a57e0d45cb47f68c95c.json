First, it is possible that some patients in Key West have HTLV-I antibody because it is a tropical island on the edge of the TSP Caribbean belt. Second, modern society being so mobile, individuals who have lived or traveled to HTLV-I-endemic regions may develop antibody, return to more northern latitudes, and later develop MS independent of their HTLV-I status. Further, it should be expected that MS patients have lifestyles that are similar to the general population. Some will develop HIV antibody as a result of homosexual activity, heterosexual transfer, intravenous drug usage, and transfusion. Careful questioning may identify these individuals.",

Koprowski [personal communication) believes that there is insufficient antigen on commercial plates to detect the possible cross-reactions with yet unidentified retrovirus. He believes that one must greatly overload the plates with antigen to identlfy the possible cross-reacting antibodies. Data from the use of commercial kits indicated that such kits are constructed to be overly sensitive; they identify 1 to 3% of false positives in order not to miss any true positives. Our laboratory has had experience in developing many ELISA tests for serological studies. We find it necessary to titrate the antigen and conjugate with positive and negative serum to get the right concentration of each to ensure maximum sensitivity and specificity. Altering one parameter, such as increasing antigen concentration, may increase nonspecificity and false-positive reaction. IFA is useful in confirming HTLV-I antibody and, by use of proper cell control, in detecting nonspecificity.",

It is possible for some MS patients to have retrovirus antibody that is not related to MS. During the past 10 years, more than ten different possible agents have been suggested as causes of MS [27. Among these are a number of recognized viruses, such as measles, canine distemper, scrapie agent, and coronaviruses, and multiple sclerosis-associated agents of unclear classification, the bone marrow agent, and the chimpanzee agent. The serological evidence for etiological association of a retrovirus with MS seems weaker than that available for measles, rubella, and coronavirus.",

Tropical spastic paraparesis (TSP) has been associated with human T-lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I), and a subacute encephalopathy and neuropathy has been associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Recently, Koprowski and colleagues 111 reported that outbreaks of multiple sclerosis (MS) in Key West, Florida, and in Sweden were associated with increased antibody for human retroviruses. In addition, homology studies under nonstringent conditions using cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cells derived from MS patients reacted with HTLV-I antigen.
