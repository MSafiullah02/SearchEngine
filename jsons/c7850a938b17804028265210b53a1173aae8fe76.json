Methods Collected samples of nasopharyngeal swabs from 2 patients diagnosed with C OVID-19 at the First People's Hospital of Zhaoqing City, each of sample was divided into 5 groups (groupA~E): A:Non-inactivated raw sample; B:75% ethanol inactivation; C:56 \u2103 incubation for 30 min inactivation; D:65 \u2103 incubation for 10 min inactivation; E:Pre-J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f",

The objectives are to compare the effect of the varied inactivation method on CT(Cycle Threshold)results in PCR, conduct correlation and Bland-Altman analysis. Results For the N gene and ORF1ab gene, the CT values of 4 inactivated and Non-inactivated treatment were correlated (P\uff1c0.001). The results of the four treatment methods and specimens without inactivated treatment have shown good consistency. Conclusion The treatment of nasopharyngeal swab specimens using mentioned four inactivated methods had no significant effect on the subsequent detection of the new COVID-19 nucleic acid test. Lab test-persons can flexibly adopt preinactivation methods to ensure the accuracy of virus nucleic acid test results, meanwhile guarantee the safety of lab test-persons.",

At the meantime more than 1000 medical staff were infected in China, resulting in 5 deaths. The First People's Hospital is appointed COVID-19 patients treatment institution in Zhaoqing City. By far it has accepted 20 confirmed cases of new coronary pneumonia patients, out of which 10 cases have been cured and 1 case ended in casualty. According to the COVID-19 Diagnosis and Treatment Plan (6 th Trail Edition), this virus is highly contagious and can spread quickly among population. There is no specific diagnosis and treatment program against the pneumonia caused by COVID-19 (Zhu et al., 2020).",

According to documents such as the in-use guidance for the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19, this virus can be inactivated either at 75% alcohol, 56 degrees incubation for 30 min, or 65 degrees incubation for 10 min according to Chinese expert's consensus(National Health Commission of the People's Republic of China, 2020; Group of experts on medical treatment from Tongji Hospital affiliated of Wuhan Tongji Medical College, 2020; Chinese Society of Laboratory Medicine, 2020). In order to reduce the risk of in-lab infection during the experimental operation, reduce the mental stress of laboratory staff, the high-risk specimen will be inactivated before the lab-test undergoes. However it remains unknown whether the specimen inactivation would affect the subsequent RT-PCR test results or not. Therefore, this study intends to compare 4 different inactivation methods to explore impact of the 4 inactivation methods upon the results of viral nucleic acid PCR detection, and to lower the risk of medical staff in-lab infection while ensuring the accuracy of the test, and eventually to provide new solutions for the laboratory biosecurity environment protection.",

            "text": ").the experimental results, in this particular study, the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient and Bland-Altman analysis method were applied to testify the PCR correlation and coefficiency between non-inactivated samples and samples inactivated using the four methods respectively. As the data analysis results show, for the N gene and ORF1ab gene, the CT values of 4 inactivated and non-inactivated treatment were correlated (P\uff1c0.001). Besides, as the figureJ o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f shown, for the N gene, 12.5% (1/8) of scattered points of 56\u2103/30min inactivated sample, 65\u2103/10min sample, RNA virus-specific preservation fluid sample were distributed outside the 95% trust interval. For the ORF1ab gene, All points are distributed within the 95% trust interval.This indicates that the results of the four treatment methods and non-inactivation treatment have shown good consistency.This suggests that, before conducting viral nucleic acid testing, inactivate nasopharyngeal swab specimens using 75% ethanol, 56 \u2103 30 min, 65 \u2103 10 min, or RNA virus-specific preservation fluid will impose no significant effect on subsequent COVID-19 nucleic acid testing, which can also effectively protect laboratory staff and reduce mental stress at work. Most laboratories tend to use three other inactivation methods as the RNA virus-specific preservation fluid tubes need to be purchased separately. There are also some limitations in this research because only two specimens were analyzed. Furthermore, dilution of the sample may lead to the decreases in detection efficiency. In this case for some specimens with low CT value, the sample size needs to be expanded for further analysis. Besides in this particular study, used only one test kit box is used for analysis, and it is suggested that future researchers should expanded the scope of study, in order to provide up-to-date strategies for virus inactivation.In addition, according to the longitudinal comparison of RNA test results from 20 COVID-19 confirmed cases in the First People's Hospital of Zhaoqing City for nearly 30 days, It is suggested that nasopharyngeal swab nucleic acid test results starts to turn and remain negative two or three week after hospitalized, while cloacal swab results show continuous positive, which signifies that, viruses may have starts metastasis to alimentary canals.
