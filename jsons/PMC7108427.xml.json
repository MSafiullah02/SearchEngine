The prototypic acylguanidine is amiloride (Fig. 1\n), a potassium-sparing diuretic widely used in medicine, which was first described in 1967 by Cragoe et al. [1]. The primary target of amiloride is the epithelial Na+ channel, which it inhibits at nanomolar concentrations [2]. At micromolar concentrations amiloride inhibits several other cellular ion transporters (e.g. Na+/H+ exchanger), enzymes and receptors [2]. The epithelial Na+ channel is an important target in the treatment of hypertension and cystic fibrosis, and the Na+/H+ exchanger is a central factor in growth and invasive properties of many cancer cells and in cell damage following myocardial infarction. For these reasons numerous acylguanidines with increased potency and specificity towards either the epithelial Na+ channel or the Na+/H+ exchanger compared with amiloride have been synthesised 2, 3, 4.",

            "text": "HIV-1 encodes nine proteins that are required for its replication and for manipulation of the host; one of them is an accessory protein Vpu, which is absent from HIV-2 [6]. The established functions of Vpu in infected cells are downregulation of tetherin (also known as BST-2, CD317 or HM1.24) and CD4 [7]. Tetherin inhibits virus release by being incorporated into nascent virions and cross-linking the viral and the cellular membranes. CD4 is crucial for virus entry, but later in the replication cycle it can inhibit assembly, release and infectivity of progeny virions by interacting with viral glycoproteins. Two studies have demonstrated that Vpu contributes to the efficient spread of HIV-1 in vivo. Singh et al. infected macaques with chimeric simian-HIV, expressing either wild-type Vpu, or mutated Vpu that did not downregulate CD4 [8]. The animals producing wild-type Vpu maintained significantly higher viral loads than those producing the mutated protein, which suggested that downregulation of CD4 by Vpu contributes to the pathogenicity of HIV-1 [8]. In another study, Sato et al. infected \u2018humanised\u2019 mice producing human leukocytes, including CD4+ T cells, with wild-type and Vpu-deficient HIV-1 and showed that the wild-type virus propagated more rapidly than the Vpu-deficient virus [9]. Furthermore, they showed that Vpu increased the release of cell-free virions without affecting cell-to-cell HIV-1 transmission [9].",

It forms pentameric cation-selective ion channels in planar lipid bilayers 10, 11. Studies by Ewart et al. at Biotron Limited showed that the ion channels formed by Vpu or its transmembrane domain are blocked by amiloride derivatives HMA and 5-(N,N-dimethyl)amiloride (DMA) (Fig. 1), but not by amiloride itself [12]. HMA was also shown to inhibit budding of virus-like particles from HeLa cells, suggesting a link between the ion channel activity of Vpu and virus release [12]. Subsequent studies demonstrated that HMA and DMA inhibit HIV-1 replication in cultured human macrophages [13]. An ensuing program of chemical synthesis by the Biotron generated a library of approximately 300 compounds, with a leading compound BIT225 (Fig. 1) [14]. BIT225, at 40 \u03bcm concentration, completely blocked the ion channel formed by the Vpu transmembrane domain in planar lipid bilayers, and reduced HIV-1 yield in the supernatant of cultured human macrophages with a 50% effective concentration (EC50) of 2.25 \u03bcm and a selectivity index (a ratio between 50% toxic concentration and EC50) of 126 [14]. No reduction in the yield of extracellular HIV-2, which lacks Vpu, was observed under these conditions, demonstrating that Vpu is indeed the antiviral target of BIT225 [14]. Biotron has recently started stage Ib/IIa clinical trials of BIT225, in which 18 HIV-positive, treatment-naive patients will be administered the drug over 10 days, with other eight patients receiving a placebo. The results are expected in the first quarter of 2012 (Biotron: http://www.biotron.com.au).",

The prevailing hypothesis is that it is because of the inhibition of the ion channel activity of Vpu. However, currently there is no proof that the ion channel activity of Vpu has a role in the virus replication cycle. Published data suggest that it is not required for downregulation of CD4 or tetherin as Vpu mutants without ion channel function retain their ability to downregulate CD4 and tetherin 11, 15, 16. Alternatively, acylguanidines could block Vpu binding to its cellular targets. However, Kuhl et al. have recently demonstrated that BIT225 does not interfere with Vpu-tetherin interaction [17]. Moreover, the compound inhibited HIV-1 yield in CD4+ T-cell lines without affecting tetherin modulation [17]. These data suggest that the antiviral action of acylguanidines is not because of the inhibition of tetherin downregulation by Vpu. A potential effect of BIT225 on CD4 downregulation remains to be investigated. Also, recent studies identified new cellular targets of Vpu, SLAMF6 and CD1d 9, 18, 19. Further work is required to determine which functions of Vpu in infected cells are inhibited by acylguanidines, and whether the inhibition occurs through the blockade of its ion channel activity or through an alternative mechanism.",

It forms hexa- and heptameric cation-selective channels in phospholipid membranes 24, 25, 26, 27, and is required, together with one of the non-structural proteins, NS2, for effective assembly and release of infectious virus 28, 29. In vivo, p7 is essential for HCV infectivity in chimpanzees [30].",

            "text": "Both ion channel and non-ion-channel functions of p7 are required for production of infectious virus. HCV assembly is believed to occur at the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) where viral envelope proteins accumulate 31, 32. Recent studies of Boson et al. demonstrated that co-localisation of the core protein with the envelope proteins at the ER is required for efficient virion assembly, and that p7 and NS2 are the strain-specific factors governing intracellular localisation of core protein in infected cells [33]. Although the ion channel activity of p7 appears unlikely to be involved in the core protein localisation 33, 34, it is crucial for intracellular virus viability. Extracellular HCV virions are acid-resistant, whereas intracellular virus particles have greatly increased acid sensitivity [35]. Proton channel activity of p7 protects intracellular virus particles by preventing the obligate acidification of intracellular compartments [35]. Mutations in p7 abrogating its ion channel activity resulted in complete loss of infectious virus production, which could be partially restored by preventing acidification with the inhibitor bafilomycin A1 [35].",

The current hypothesis regarding the mechanism of antiviral activity of BIT225 is that it is related to the inhibition of p7 ion channel activity, which remains to be confirmed. The compound has recently completed stage IIa clinical trials on 24 hepatitis C patients who were randomly assigned to receive either 400 mg or 200 mg BIT225, or placebo (ratio of 1:1:1), for the first 28 days of their standard treatment with interferon and ribavirin. Preliminary analysis of trial data showed approximately tenfold greater virus reduction in the blood of patients receiving 400 mg dose of BIT225 compared to those receiving interferon and ribavirin only (Biotron: http://www.biotron.com.au).",

The antiviral effect of amiloride and EIPA was because of the inhibition of CVB3 RNA replication, with two individual amino acid substitutions in 3Dpol conferring resistance of the virus to the compounds [55]. Subsequent in vitro studies demonstrated that amiloride and EIPA inhibited enzymatic activity of 3Dpol, affecting both VPg-primed initiation and elongation steps of RNA synthesis [56]. Amiloride acted as a competitive inhibitor, competing with incoming nucleotide and Mg2+ for binding to the active site of the enzyme [56]. There was, however, a marked difference in the rank order of the compounds between inhibition of 3Dpol\nin vitro (EIPA > amiloride > benzamil > HMA, with EC50 of 11 \u03bcm, 20 \u03bcm, 52 \u03bcm and 136 \u03bcm, respectively, in an RNA elongation assay) and inhibition of virus replication in cell culture (EIPA = HMA > benzamil > amiloride, with EC50 of 2 \u03bcm, 2 \u03bcm, 10 \u03bcm and 60 \u03bcm, respectively) (55, 56 and E.V. Gazina, unpublished). There are two potential reasons for this discrepancy. Although 3Dpol is the only target of amiloride and EIPA, additional targets cannot be ruled out for benzamil and HMA. For example, CVB3 protein 2B, a transmembrane protein similar to the viral ion channel proteins described above 57, 58, might be inhibited by HMA and benzamil. Alternatively, there may be large differences in intracellular accumulation between the compounds.",

Importantly, it inhibits viruses for which no antiviral treatment is currently available (i.e. SARS-CoV and CVB3) or targets proteins, which are not targeted by existing antiviral therapies (i.e. HIV-1 Vpu and HCV p7). Unfortunately, HMA has a much higher potency as a blocker of cellular Na+/H+ exchanger [2] than as inhibitor of viral proteins, which rules it out as an antiviral drug. However, the development of BIT225, which is sufficiently potent and specific against HIV-1 and HCV to progress to clinical trials, clearly demonstrates that amiloride derivatives are very useful as a starting point in antiviral drug development. Structure\u2013activity studies on SARS-CoV E and CVB3 3Dpol may also produce potent and specific antiviral drugs in the future, whereas antiviral activity of acylguanidines against Dengue viruses is yet to be demonstrated.",
