A polymicrobial aetiology has been recognized and intentional or accidental trauma has been proposed as a possible source of infection [6, 7]. In addition, several predisposing factors such as diabetes, chronic alcoholism, human immunodeficiency virus, chronic steroid abuse, cytotoxic drugs, lympho-proliferative disease, malnutrition and lower socio-economic status have been associated with the occurrence of FG [8, 9].",

Immediate empiric parenteral antibiotic treatment should be given; this can then be refined, guided by microbiological culture [8, 10]. Usually, repeated debridement is necessary leading to complex wound closure that requires frequent dressing and may need flaps or skin grafts [10]. Different protocols have been reported for postoperative open wound care, but their efficacy has not been properly analyzed and shows a very low level of evidence in the current guidelines [10]. Lack of evidence regarding the role of vacuum-assisted closure (VAC) therapy in FG (level of evidence 4) [10] led us to explore its role in this rare niche of patients.",

Several characteristics of patients with local and disseminated FG managed by VAC or no-VAC treatment were similar. Particularly, no statistically significant differences were found for the following variables (see Table 1): age, distribution of predisposing factors such as obesity (BMI \u2265 30), smoking, alcoholism, kidney failure, neurogenic bladder and pelvic radiotherapy and blood results such as C-reactive protein, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio and procalcitonin. The Fournier Gangrene Severity Index (FGSI) was calculated in all the groups and did not show significant differences (p = 0.13). The most common origin of local FG was urogenital diseases whilst disseminated FG origin was mostly mixed urogenital and anorectal. A median number of two microorganisms was isolated both in patients with local (IQR 1\u20133) and with disseminated FG (IQR 2\u20133) (p = 0.284). The frequency distribution of reported microorganisms in the two FG groups are shown in Fig. 1.",

Beneficial effects of HBO such as an increase in oxygen tension in the infected area have been reported [22\u201324] in very small case series ameliorating the tissue oxygenation [23]. However, HBO is an expensive treatment option without any described improvement in prognosis [25]. Therefore, Wagner et al. suggested an aggressive multimodality therapy based on surgery, antibiotics and VAC could be crucial where other approaches such as HBO may be more expensive and not so helpful [26]. VAC has been criticized to be expensive [27], Ozturk et al. performed a cost analysis reporting that the cost for treating five FG patients with VAC was $8,850 versus $8,800 for conventional treatment of five similar patients [11]. Although there were not significant differences in the costs, this was just a preliminary and not accurate estimation.

In our study, of 92 FG patients, 33 were treated with VAC (19 with local and 14 with disseminated disease) and 59 were treated with conventional approach (43 with local and 16 with disseminated disease).

Regarding the cumulative rate of wound closure, the results at 10 weeks after surgery did not show a statistically significant difference in the local FG group once treated with or without VAC. Conversely, the multivariable logistic regression analysis of 10-weeks wound closure cumulative rate showed that the disseminated FG patients treated with VAC had a higher percentage of wound closure (p = 0.036). Furthermore, comparing the KM Kaplan\u2013Meier survival curves for the OS, a significant difference between patients with local and disseminated FG was found when patients were treated with conventional dressings (OS rate at 90 days 0.90, 95% CI 0.71\u20130.97 vs 0.55, 95% CI 0.24\u20130.78, respectively; p = 0.039) and the Cox proportional hazard regression model highlighted that patients with disseminated FG managed with the no-VAC approach showed the lowest inter-group OS. Thus, our study suggests that VAC may offer an advantage in terms of wound closure at 10 weeks, especially for disseminated cases of FG where an aggressive multimodality approach can be crucial; these patients also have the lowest OS when not treated with VAC, suggesting its possible role in OS.",

In other words, given the retrospective design of our study and the relatively small sample size, conclusions cannot be definitive on the role of VAC therapy on local or disseminated FG patients. Although this is not a prospective trial, the retrospective analysis brought out some elements that seemed to suggest an advantage in the VAC use in disseminated forms of disease in terms of faster recovery and a better OS. These data seem to suggest that in a patient presenting with a disseminated FG disease, VAC therapy may offer an advantage in the context of a multimodal approach. However, given the observational retrospective design of this study and its limited number of patients, we could not provide a decision-making algorithm. Anyhow, defining a clear algorithm was not our endpoint; this aim could be adequately addressed only by a hypothesis-testing randomized clinical trial powered with a proper sample size.",

We reviewed 92 patients and a wide set of variables with a hypothesis-generating and exploratory purpose. This retrospective design did not allow to perform a controlled treatment allocation, and this led to multiple and unavoidable biases (e.g., selection, information). The sample size is limited to 92 cases that are a relatively large sample for this rare pathology, but from a statistical point of view, they can represent a limit to the analysis. A prospective randomized well powered clinical study will help to better clarify the role of VAC in this niche of patients. Unfortunately, prospectively accrue and randomize patients is also difficult since this is typically an emergency situation and does not allow for detailed, thorough anamnesis and enrolling in a trial.",
