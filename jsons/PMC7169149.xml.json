            "text": "On April 16, 2014, the Sewol ferry, owned and operated by Chonghaejin Marine Company (CMC), sank in the ocean nearby Byeongpungdo (i.e., Byeoungpung Island) in South Korea on a voyage from Incheon to Jejudo (i.e., Jeju Island). As a result, 295 passengers on board died and 9 passengers went missing. Since then, many have been questioning the causes of, and the responses to, this accident. Among the causes under speculation is the overloading of cargo and passengers\u2014which was possible due to the construction of extra passenger cabins beyond the original loading capacity of the vessel\u2014triggered by the CMC's intent of profit maximization and compounded by ineffective government oversight of related safety issues. Such ineffective oversight seemed possible mainly because of long\u2010standing ties between a number of government bureaucrats and the CMC. Additionally, conjectures have arisen regarding how improper responses dealing with the sinking and capsizing ferry ship resulted in much preventable loss of life, from a post hoc disaster management perspective. Included amid these conjectures are the lack of professionalism and negligence of duty on the part of the ferry captain and some crewmembers in response to the emergency, and most crucially, the untimely and ineffective rescue operations led by the Korea Coast Guard (KCG).",

Such individual level scrutiny would temporarily lessen public outrage regarding the tragedy, but hamper us from comprehending it more systemically.

According to the report from the special prosecutors released in May 2014, for instance, the KCG could have saved morepassengers had the rescue crew entered the ship immediately after arriving at the site of incident (Korea Board of Audit and Inspection, 2014; Korea Prosecution Service, 2014; Korean Maritime Safety Tribunal, 2014). The captain of the KCG's patrol vessel on duty was given a four\u2010year prison sentence for his negligence in initiating prompt rescue operations. However, the question still remains whether total responsibility can be attributed to the captain of one small patrol vessel. This research probes into systemic cause behind the unsuccessful disaster responses from the KCG. In doing so, we analyze the KCG's aptitudes, attitudes, and behaviors vis\u2010\u00e0\u2010vis its rescue operations in the broader context of Sewol ferry disaster management, while utilizing classic theories of bureaucratic accountability.",

            "text": "As the importance of the role of government bureaucrats has increased in various phases of policy and administrative processes, researchers have begun to direct attention to the concept of bureaucratic accountability (Cleary, 1980). However, a precise analysis of bureaucratic accountability is not an easy task. Definition of accountability is composed of various conceptual components, and the relationships among those components are not only complex but continuously changing, contingent upon various distinctive administrative contexts (Drott et al., 2013; Oliver & Drewry, 1996). In fact, Maggetti and Verhoest (2014) argue that bureaucratic accountability in a particular society or country is a historical construct generated with the establishment of a country\u2010specific bureaucratic institution. This means that the conceptual definition and scope of accountability can be diverse due to the endemic and historical courses of national and institutional development. Nonetheless, accountability is considered one of the most important concepts in public administration (Huber & Rothstein, 2013; Marchant, 2001; Matten, 2004; Rothstein, 2003). More specifically, bureaucratic accountability is an essential standard for government service and is recommended for system wide institutionalization (Mulgan, 2000).",

Rosen (1998) explains that the essence of bureaucratic accountability parallels with the citizens\u2019 interest in how bureaucrats exert power. Similarly, Gormley and Balla (2004) emphasize fairness as a core value embedded into the concept of bureaucratic accountability. They argue that as a group, bureaucrats often are not democratic representatives. Therefore, fairness ought to be the core value of bureaucratic accountability in the formulation of policy decisions and administrative practices. Bureaucratic accountability refers to \u201cdesirable\u201d attitudes, aptitudes, and behaviors of government agencies expected for the pursuit of the welfare of their citizens.",

Synthesizing previous arguments, Romzek and Ingraham (2000, p. 242) further claim that four conceptually distinctive types of bureaucratic accountability (i.e., hierarchical, legal, professional, and political accountability) are often grounded in two fundamental organizational contingencies: (i) degree of bureaucratic autonomy and (ii) source of expectations and/or control over bureaucratic behavior.",

Ideally, government agencies are expected to equally sustain these various types of accountability when performing their organizational tasks. However, in reality, depending on the parameters of the three aforementioned organizational characteristics, agencies\u2019 accountability configurations vary, while, more often than not, disproportionally emphasizing one or two more dominant dimension(s)\u2014or type(s)\u2014of bureaucratic accountability in their daily administrative practices. For example, professional accountability would be considered the most important type of bureaucratic accountability within those government agencies whose primary tasks frequently involve highly scientific and technical matters, such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). Furthermore, within the same government agency, those in top manager positions are more likely than middle managers or street level bureaucrats to emphasize political accountability, while aiming to maintain responsiveness toward key external stakeholders. This discussion is summarized in Table 1.",

            "text": "Historically, the KCG has maintained a very similar character to the South Korean navy, which itself focuses on maritime security rather than emergency management. After independence from Japanese rule in 1945, the \u201cmodern\u201d South Korean navy needed to defend its national sea jurisdiction and later intercept infiltrators sent by North Korea to the South. In addition to sustaining national security through these activities, the navy was also responsible for inspecting Japanese fishing boats crossing the sea border (Roh, 2011) to protect the South Korean fishing industry. However, such practices by the Korean navy could be interpreted as invasive military action as, conventionally, a foreign ship is considered a part of foreign territory, which could generate rising military tension with a neighboring country. Accordingly, the KCG, which used a similar rank system to the Korean navy as a part of the Maritime Police Unit within the National Police Agency in South Korea, was founded in 1953 to substitute for the Korean navy's duties of inspecting civilian ships (KCG, 2013c) while not instigating any unnecessary potential international conflicts. Because of these origins and its organizational nature as a police unit, hierarchical accountability, in which members are judged by how well they obey commands, has long been emphasized within the KCG.2\n",

Following the Korean\u2013Japanese Fisheries Agreement in 1965, however, this inspection role, especially against Japanese fishing boats, gradually waned, as the agreement encompassed the establishment of a clear jurisdictional demarcation of the sea between South Korea and Japan. The KCG instead assumed the tasks of criminal investigation and law enforcement in the sea with the Maritime Police Force Act in 1962 (KCG, 2013c). The KCG increasingly concentrated on policing against violent crime and maritime pollution.",

A temporarily peaceful mood was fostered by the inter\u2010Korean reconciliation and peace agreement in 1992. In 1992, South Korea established diplomatic ties with the People's Republic of China, which inadvertently encouraged the development of an illegal Chinese fishing industry in Korean waters (Roh, 2011). Prior to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, passed in 1994, South Korea had no authority regarding maritime borders, but with this convention, all countries were granted special rights over the use of marine resources in an exclusive economic zone (EEZ) extending 200 nautical miles from their shores (KCG, 2013a). With the recognition of the growing importance of sea resources, the KCG became an independent agency in 1996 as a direct countermeasure against Chinese illegal fishing (KCG, 2013c). Since that period, the primary role of the KCG, as an independent government agency, has remained inspection and patrol. The KCG has expanded the size of its budget 5.2 times since 1996 and established many local branches, including 16 coast guard stations, 87 substations, and 240 local offices, along with the KCG Academy (KCG, 2013c). Meanwhile, the KCG, along with its military origin and continued duty of inspection and patrol, has sustained the hierarchical accountability of its core accountability structure.",

Typically, Korean bureaucracy has been fully supported by political elites. Bureaucrats and political elites have maintained a close communication system for the exchange of exclusive information (Im, Campbell, & Cha, 2013). Likewise, top managers within the KCG organizational hierarchy are typically more responsive to politicians, a key external stakeholder who may hold influence on its organizational sustainability by exercising government budget and personnel decision\u2010making power, than to any other potential stakeholders, such as the issue public or related for\u2010profit or non\u2010profit entities, involved in various administrative practices. Due to such emphasis on political accountability, maritime security, including inspection and patrol, have become the primary priority for the KCG over any other duties to external stakeholders, though the KCG has been responsible for various additional duties, including search and rescue, marine environmental protection, maritime traffic safety management, and maritime pollution response (KCG, 2013a). Three specific contingencies illustrate why the KCG was inclined to prioritize political accountability: (i) the increasing illegal fishing activities of Chinese ships; (ii) the \u201cjurisdictional\u201d conflict with the National Police Agency; and (iii) the dispute over equitable distribution of the increasing police human resources pool allocated by South Korean central personnel authorities.",

This has also been a prime opportunity for the KCG to promote itself. News images, as well as documentary films portraying the hardships of staff patrolling waters against illegal Chinese fishing boats, were produced with the KCG's assistance (Korean Broadcasting System, 2012; Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation, 2011). Shocked by these dire scenes, members of the general public began to call for better equipment for KCG operations, which translated to more justifiable resources for the KCG.4\n",

For example, the KCG's budget for search and rescue missions in 2013 was about 9 million U.S. dollars, which constitutes only 1.6 percent of its total annual budget of 1.5 billion U.S. dollars. Meanwhile, in the same year, the KCG spent approximately 300 million U.S. dollars on maritime security (KCG, 2013c). The KCG's annual report released in 2014 also shows that much of new personnel recruitment was related to the maritime security mission: 3,700 newly hired personnel (42.6 percent of total recruits) were assigned to maritime security. In contrast, only 482 personnel (5.6 percent of total recruits) were assigned to search and rescue functions. In addition, the KCG had purchased heavy vessels and aircraft rather than basic rescue equipment for search and rescue. It turned out later that 52 out of 328 field offices that take first action, when maritime accidents occur, did not have basic rescue equipment, such as patrol boats or jet skis (Korea Board of Audit and Inspection, 2014).",

As discussed briefly, although the term \u201cKorea Coast Guard\u201d has been used since 1991, the KCG resided under the National Police Agency until 1996, the year when it became an independent government agency for the first time. For instance, from 1986 to 1989, the KCG assumed control over incoming and outgoing sea vessels, which previously were under the jurisdiction of the National Police Agency. However, the line of authority and responsibility between the two governmental entities was murky due to a lack of legal clarification during the structural reorganization process. In fact, a policy study regarding the restructuring of the KCG's branch offices led by the Korean Association for Policy Studies (2013) found\u2014through personal interviews\u2014that even some chief officers of the same KCG substation were unclear about their jurisdiction and interpreted it quite differently. One of the main goals of the KCG, as a government entity holding its own organizational \u201csovereignty,\u201d was to establish a clear\u2010cut line of authority and responsibility for itself, independent from the National Police Agency. For that end, the KCG needed more political support from its stakeholders, notably legislators, in exchange for a high degree of political accountability.",

One crewman of the patrol vessel attempted to enter the cabin at 9:49 a.m., when the ship was tilted about 62 degrees.

We are saving the passengers outside one by one.\u201d Four minutes later, the patrol vessel reported again, \u201cWe are anchored alongside the left side of the ferry, but the passengers cannot descend from the ferry because of the steep slope. The ferry is about to sink.\u201d The KCG West Regional Headquarters finally ordered that the crewmen of the patrol vessel go inside the cabin and calm the passengers. However, it was too late and the answer from the patrol vessel was the same: \u201cWe cannot go inside the ferry because of the steep slope.\u201d Then, at 9:57 a.m., the chief of the Mokpo Coast Guard asked the patrol vessel to call over a loudspeaker for the passengers to jump out of the ferry. The reply from the patrol vessel was unaltered: \u201cThe passengers cannot jump from the ferry because the left side is completely sunk. Only rescue by helicopter might be possible.\u201d At 10:05 a.m., the chief of the Mokpo Coast Guard again ordered the crew to call over loudspeaker for the passengers to jump.

This timeline leads to the inference that the orders from the KCG West Regional Headquarters were neither timely nor appropriate during the rescue operations; they should have given the order for rescue crews to enter the sinking ship immediately after the incident was reported. To make matters worse, mainly due to hierarchical accountability concerns, the captain of the patrol vessel did not make any prompt discretionary decisions to rescue the passengers upon arrival at the scene with his rescue team during the vacuum of timely orders passed down the line of command within the KCG's organizational hierarchy (Korean Maritime Safety Tribunal, 2014). Finally, the KCG West Regional Headquarters made delayed orders, but they were not feasible for rescue crews to implement. Again, instead of suggesting and executing alternative means to help those passengers in the sinking ship, the rescue crews responded to their commanders in a passive manner while repeating that the orders were impossible to follow.",

Firstly, the KCG, which was originally a part of the South Korean navy organization, has mainly focused on its inspection and patrol related duties while sustaining the hierarchical accountability inherited from its organizational origin. As a result, the lower ranking officers, such as the crew members of patrol vessel No.123 at the scene of the Sewol ferry accident, did not take any discretionary actions during the crucial but small window of opportunity for their rescue operations due to their choice to continue awaiting delayed rescue orders issued from the upper rungs of KCG's ladder of command and control.",

As a consequence, when encountering a \u201cmundane\u201d rescue operation situation during the Sewol ferry accident, the KCG was not able to function properly and adeptly. In fact, the KCG dispatched all large and medium\u2010size coast guard vessels to patrol the water against illegal Chinese fishing activities, violating the central government's security regulation that more than one medium\u2010size (i.e., 200 ton) coast guard vessel must always be located in the inland sea for emergency situations, which resulted in the lack of resources critical for effective rescue operations at the Sewol ferry scene.

Meanwhile, the second theoretical perspective emphasizes technical and managerial issues that many disaster management organizations are dealing with in their day\u2010to\u2010day practices (Hwang & Park, 2016; Sadiq, 2017; Stark, 2011; \u2018t Hart & Sundelius, 2013). The focus of the earlier research based on this tradition, for instance, includes more practical aspects of disaster management (Cigler, 2009), incident command system of crisis contingencies (Moynihan, 2009), and multi\u2010actor cooperation in planning and responses (Egan & Tischler, 2010; Rosenthal & Kouzmin, 1991).",

More specifically, the KCG, rooted in the command and control system of the Korean navy, has been chiefly influenced by hierarchical accountability. In addition, the KCG has consistently focused on political accountability in the process of organizational development. The KCG's reaction to the Sewol ferry disaster reflected those two types of accountability; there was much concern regarding hierarchical and political accountability, along with legal accountability, in the midst of the accident. Meanwhile, there was no place for considerations regarding professional accountability within the KCG, when it was most needed.",

In spite of such disaster\u2010induced government reform, we expect that the Ministry of Public Safety and Security would not guarantee a much improved response to national disasters.",

One of the key countermeasures to mitigate disasters is to put the right experts in the right place, who have enough training to properly use their technical knowledge and professional experiences. Well\u2010trained experts with professional know\u2010how (and the leeway and capability to improvise split\u2010second independent decisions) are essential for predicting, assessing, and managing various disasters (Kapucu, Augustin, & Garayev, 2009; Koliba, Mills, & Zia, 2011; Richardson, Macauley, Cohen, Anderson, & Stern, 2011). Romzek and Dubnick (1987), for example, claimed that decision\u2010making relying upon professional accountability plays an important role in avoiding management failure in their analysis of the 1986 U.S. space shuttle Challenger disaster. Romzek and Dubnick (1987) also show that the political and bureaucratic accountability which had been developed at NASA in response to institutional expectations were not the appropriate mechanisms to respond to the 1986 U.S. space shuttle Challenger disaster. They insist that this management failure could have been avoided if NASA had made the decision to rely upon professional accountability. Likewise, Romzek and Ingraham (2000) claim that the culture emphasizing bureaucratic accountability rather than professional accountability within the military was one of the main culprits for the Ron Brown plane crash.",

In October 2010, for instance, after a routine food safety screening, the city of Seoul announced that octopus heads contain hazardous amounts of cadmium, a carcinogen that can generate severe negative health effects on the human body, especially on the liver and kidneys. Octopus has long been popular in South Korea (in part for its purported aphrodisiac properties) and such an announcement from the Seoul city government triggered a high\u2010alert reaction\u2014along with considerable confusion\u2014among citizens. In responding to this situation, the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety, a South Korean central government agency, promptly tested the safety of octopus consumption\u2014and other seafood\u2014and announced that all parts of octopus are safe to eat, based upon its test results (Ministry of Food and Drug Safety, 2011). Due to the prompt intervention of the Ministry of Food and Drug Safety\u2014which has long been well known for its scientific expertise on food and drug safety issues along with rigorous lab test methodology\u2014the confusion regarding the safety of octopus consumption among citizens soon boiled down, and no further serious health concerns\u2014due to the related risk perceptions\u2014prevailed.",

Deforestation has been a serious global concern for several decades. In 2007, the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations evaluated South Korea as the only country that has fully achieved successful reforestation after World War II (FAO, 2007). The Korea Forest Service played a critical role in the reforestation process. The chief executive, as well as middle managers of the Korea Forest Service, were appointed based upon their professional merits for forestry management. At the same time, the Forest Training Institute of the Korea Forest Service continually retrained public officers, who sought to acquire and update their knowledge and skills about forestry management (Korean Association for Public Administration, 2009). As a result, the Korea Forest Service, while putting an emphasis on professional accountability in its organizational structure and function, was successful in establishing and implementing a sustainable reforestation plan in South Korea over the past several decades.",
