            "text": "Behavioural economics provides labels for patterns in human economic behaviour. Probability weighting is one such label. It expresses a mismatch between probabilities used in a formal model of a decision (i.e. model parameters) and probabilities inferred from real people's decisions (the same parameters estimated empirically). The inferred probabilities are called \"decision weights.\" It is considered a robust experimental finding that decision weights are higher than probabilities for rare events, and (necessarily, through normalisation) lower than probabilities for common events. Typically this is presented as a cognitive bias, i.e. an error of judgement by the person. Here we point out that the same observation can be described differently: broadly speaking, probability weighting means that a decision maker has greater uncertainty about the world than the observer. We offer a plausible mechanism whereby such differences in uncertainty arise naturally: when a decision maker must estimate probabilities as frequencies in a time series while the observer knows them a priori. This suggests an alternative presentation of probability weighting as a principled response by a decision maker to uncertainties unaccounted for in an observer's model.",

It is one way to conceptualise a pattern in human behaviour of caution with respect to formal models. This is best explained by a thought experiment, in which a disinterested observer (DO), such as an experimenter, tells a decision maker (DM) that an event occurs with some probability. The DO observes the DM's behaviour (e.g. gambling on the event) and finds it consistent with a behavioural model (e.g. expectedutility optimization) in which the DM uses a probability that differs systematically from what the DO has declared. The apparent probabilities, inferred from the DM's decisions, are called \"decision weights.\" We will adopt this nomenclature here.",

As a sanity check, consider the shape of the w(p) (blue curve, right panel Fig. 2 ): for a given value of \u03b1, it is just a power law in p with some pre-factor that ensures normalization. If \u03b1 > 1 it means that the DM uses a greater standard deviation than the DO. In this case, the exponent of p satisfies 1 \u03b1 2 < 1, and the blue curve is above the diagonal for small densities and below it for large densities.",

In such circumstances, caution may dictate that the DM assign to rare events higher probabilities than his estimates, commensurate with his uncertainty in them. This would look like probability weighting to a DO and, indeed, would constitute a mechanistic reason for it. 4 Formalising these thoughts, we find that so long as relative uncertainties are larger for rare events than for common events -which, generically, they are -then an inverse-S curve emerges. See Appendix A for a detailed discussion. Here we make a simple scaling argument and then check it with a simulation. For an asymptotic probability density p(x), the number of events n(x) we see in the small interval [x, x + \u03b4x] in a time series of T observations is proportional to p(x), to \u03b4x, and to T .

First, analytically, by applying the DM's cautionary correction in (Eq. 14) directly to reference probability density functions. Second, by simulating the DM compiling counts of outcomes drawn from reference distributions, from which he estimates probability densities and their uncertainties. The simulation is meant to explore how noisy the effect is when a DM really only sees a single time series. The Python code is available at bit.ly/lml-pw-code-dm-count, and a Jupyter notebook can be loaded to manipulate the code in an online environment at bit.ly/lml-pw-dm-count-b. In both cases, we treat the DO as using the reference distribution to make his predictions of the DM's behaviour. Figure 6 shows the resulting PDFs and CDF mappings generated by settingp(x) in (Eq. 14) to be the probability density functions for a Gaussian distribution and a fattailed t-distribution. Inverse-S curves are found for both distributions and the effect is more pronounced for the fat-tailed distribution. Figure 6 : Mapping PDFs and CDFs with estimation errors. PDFs (left) and inverse-S curves (right) arising when the DO assumes a Gaussian (scale 1, location 0, top line) or a t-distribution (shape 2, location 0, bottom line), and the DM uses decision weights according to (Eq. 14) with T \u03b4x = 10. For the fat-tailed t-distribution (in the bottom line) the difference between p(x) and w(x) is more pronounced. Figure 7 shows the results of a computer simulation of a DM who observes a series of realisations of either Gaussian or t-distributed random variables, which he counts into bins. In the simulation, a probability density,p(x), is estimated for each bin as n(x)/T \u03b4x and its uncertainty, \u03b5 [p(x)], is obtained numerically as standard deviation in eachp(x) over 1000 parallel simulations. The DM's decision weights are then obtained according to (Eq. 13). Again, inverse-S curves are found for both distributions, corroborating our scaling arguments. ",

The DM, of course, has such exposure. Throughout the history of economics, it has been a common mistake, by DOs, to assume that DMs optimise what happens to them on average in an ensemble. To the DM, what happens to the ensemble is seldom a primary concern. Instead, he is concerned with what happens to him over time. Not distinguishing between these two perspectives is only permissible if they lead to identical predictions, meaning only if the relevant observables are ergodic (Peters 2019) .",

The average over the full statistical ensemble (often studied by the DO) of geometric Brownian motion grows as exp(\u00b5t). Each individual trajectory, on the other hand, grows in the long run as exp[(\u00b5 \u2212 \u03c3 2 2 )t].

Let's connect this statement to one about relative uncertainties. The decision weight is arrived at by adding the probability p(x) to its uncertainty \u03b5 [p(x)] and normalising, as we did in (Eq. 13), i.e.This can be expressed aswhere \u03b5[p(x)] p(x) is the relative error, and the denominator of (Eq. 18) is a normalisation constant. If the relative error is larger for small probabilities than for large probabilities, then small probabilities are enhanced more (the summand \u03b5[p(x)] p(x) in the numerator is greater) than large probabilities. The normalisation constant scales down all probabilities equally, and where the enhancement was greater, w(x) ends up above p(x), and where it was lower w(x) ends up below p(x). So, if the relative error is larger for small probabilities, an inverse-S curve emerges.We can say one more thing about this procedure. If an inverse-S curve exists, then p(x) and w(x) cross somewhere, see Fig. 6 . This happens when the relative error attains its expectation value (with respect to the density p). Rewriting (Eq. 18) aswe see that w(x) = p(x) when \u03b5[p] p = \u03b5[p]p .",
