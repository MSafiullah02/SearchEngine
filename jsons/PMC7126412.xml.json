Since proteins function by interacting with other molecules, similarity in the binding patterns of proteins is closely related to similarity in their biological functions. There are two potential ways to infer the function of a novel protein. The first is to recognize a sequence or fold similarity with a protein(s) whose function is known. However, a similar fold does not necessarily imply a similar function. For example, proteins with the same fold, like TIM barrels, can have multiple functions.1 On the other hand, proteins with different folds, like subtilisin and trypsin, can share the same function. The alternative approach, implemented in our method, is to investigate the physico-chemical patterns and shape of the protein molecular surface. Proteins are assumed to perform similar functions if they share similar binding patterns and recognize similar binding partners, even if they have different sequences and (overall) fold homology.",

These are crucial for the development of targeted drug leads like inhibitors. Functional annotation of newly determined structures can be a significant contribution to the Structural Genomics initiative.2.Potential ligands and ligand fragments: analysis of ligands bound to proteins with similar binding sites may provide hints of chemical groups that can be used to develop a drug for the protein target. The method can be used for lead generation and optimization as well as for de novo drug design.3.Prediction of side-effects: proteins with similar binding sites may bind the same drug and therefore may potentially cause side-effects. Thorough investigation of such proteins during the drug design process is important for the development of more specific drug leads.\n",

These techniques model the interactions of the receptor with specific ligands and therefore do not analyze all potential interactions that a specific binding site may form. This is particularly important, since a single protein-binding site may have several binding patterns. Not only can the same binding site bind different ligands with different functional groups, but there is also evidence that at least in some enzymes a single compound can bind in different ways.10., 11., 12. A wide variety of methods have been developed for protein structural alignment.13 Most existing methods describe a protein structure by its C\u03b1 atoms and seek to maximize the overall similarity of the structures. However, when there is no fold similarity between the aligned structures, these methods usually do not provide a biologically significant alignment. Analysis of the similarities between binding sites can complement these techniques, ensuring full exploration of available structural data.",

This algorithm (ASSAM) was recently enhanced to include additional constraints such as: the secondary structures, the solvent accessibility and the disulfide bridges.16 Wallace et al.17., 18. have introduced \u201ccoordinate templates\u201d. These allow recognition of the \u201ccatalytic triads\u201d that are typical for some of the protein families, like serine proteases, triacylglycerol lipases, ribonucleases and lysozymes. Using atomic representation, the geometric hashing technique19., 20., 21. was applied to efficiently compare a query protein to the template of the catalytic triad. This algorithm (TESS) has been recently updated by JESS,22 which is flexible and unconstrained by the template syntax. Binkowski et al.23 have recently presented an elegant approach to assess the similarity of sequence patterns of surface pockets and voids, which are conveniently organized in CASTp.24 Jones et al.25 have reviewed the methods for recognition of functional sites.",

Rosen et al.28 searched for a site on the protein surface that resembles a specific, known active site. The molecular surface was represented using sparse critical points defined by Lin et al.29., 30. The translation and rotation invariant characteristics of pairs of critical points were used as a key for the geometric hashing procedure. In addition, the reliability of surface comparisons in searches for active sites was examined.

Unlike other methods that use the computationally expensive clique detection algorithm (NP-hard),37., 38. our heuristic algorithm is based on efficient hashing and matching of triangles of centers of physico-chemical properties. It introduces a low-resolution representation by chemically important surface points and performs fast scoring of all possible solutions, while retaining the correct ones. Successive scoring schemes, which are applied to smaller numbers of candidate solutions, perform a thorough exploration of the overall similarity of the surfaces as well as of local shapes of the chemically similar regions. We apply SiteEngine to a set of biological applications. First, we introduce a benchmark dataset, which is used to construct two surface description databases: one of complete protein structures and the other of binding sites. We compare between various searching applications that can be performed for recognition of functional sites. Each application is illustrated by examples of successful recognition of specific types of protein binding sites such as estradiol binding, adenine and ATP binding. For each example, we further make some specific predictions by providing a list of proteins recognized to share functional similarities with the query. We provide examples of classification of fatty acid-binding proteins and serine proteases and show the capability of the method to recognize the known similarity of the binding sites as well as of the catalytic residues. At the next stage, we apply SiteEngine to search a non-redundant dataset of all known protein structures. We describe the binding sites that are recognized to be the most similar to our query binding sites and discuss the quality of the predictions obtained. Since SiteEngine searches a complete structure of each protein in a matter of seconds, we find it to be well suited for such large-scale applications.",

The rules for the representation of each amino acid as a set of such centers follow Schmitt et al.35 However, unlike their definition, we do not consider a peptide bond as an aromatic property and we do not estimate the directionality of the H-bonding property. Figure 2(a)\nshows an example of a representation of cavity-flanking residues.

The radius of the sphere determines the region in which the curvature is approximated. We perform two calculations with different definitions of the radius of the sphere.

The hashing stage of SiteEngine is extremely efficient, due to the consideration of the physico-chemical properties of the pseudocenters in addition to the geometrical constraints. As a result, we create less false-positive transformations and therefore greatly reduce the overall number of candidate solutions. We can score each candidate transformation and avoid any loss of competitive solutions due to the low number of votes. This approach allows identification of all candidate transformations that consist of at least three matching pseudocenters.

We included in our data set the proteins used in the study by Kuttner et al.48 Thirty-three of these proteins are complexed with ATP and 11 with other adenine-containing ligands. Other functional families that were included are structurally diverse proteins that can bind estradiol, equilin and retinoic acid. Second, our motivation was to include representatives of important and well-studied structural families so that we will be able to check the classification capabilities and the consistency of our method. We have selected seven different protein families: HIV-1/HIV-2, HIV protease, anhydrase, antibiotics, fatty acid-binding proteins, chorismate mutases and serine proteases.

The dataset contained five proteins which share the same \u201cprotein kinase-like\u201d fold as the query. As expected, all five are recognized as top ranking solutions and the query-binding site is correctly aligned to the binding sites of these proteins. Due to the similarity of the fold, we are able to calculate the RMSD between the locations of the ligands obtained by these solutions. As can be seen, in all cases the RMSD is less than 1.0 \u00c5. The running times measured in this test case emphasize the ability of the method to handle large protein structures. For example, the longest running time (17.3 seconds) was observed for a 980 residue molecule (1mu2) represented by 1714 pseudocenters. The ability to search the complete surface of a molecule of this size highlights the speed of our method.

Our data set contained 16 proteins of the trypsin-like fold and five proteins of the subtilisin-like.

SARS-coronavirus main protease, which cleaves the polyproteins of SARS-coronavirus, is responsible for the virus replication and therefore for the disease.50., 51.

In contrast to serine proteases which have a Ser-His-Asp catalytic triad, SARS-coronavirus main protease functions through a catalytic dyad, Cys-His. Our method has successfully detected the spatial similarity between the histidine residues common to all these proteins. Figure 6(b) presents a superimposition of the complexes of 3tec and 4sgb on the structure of lq2w by the transformation calculated by SiteEngine. As can be seen, the solution obtained provides a good alignment of the catalytic histidine residues of the three proteins.

In order to verify our method, we have searched the database of binding sites with a complete structure of a fatty acid-binding protein (1lib). The location of the binding site in this protein is well known and the database of binding sites contained six binding sites that are very similar to it. SiteEngine was able to correctly select them from the database of binding sites. Table 4 presents the highest-ranking solutions. As can be seen, the six highest-ranking solutions are the binding sites that are known to be similar to the query protein. We have calculated the RMSD45 between the ligands of these proteins when they are superimposed by two transformations: one defined by the superimposition of the C\u03b1 atoms and the other defined by SiteEngine. As can be seen, the RMSD in all cases is very low and even existing techniques like docking4., 5. consider such transformations to be a success. As detailed below, binding sites of fatty acid-binding proteins that did not receive a high rank are known to exhibit a different binding pattern than the query protein. However, all database binding sites that were extracted from fatty acid-binding proteins were correctly superimposed on the region of the query protein known as its binding site. To visualize these results, Figure 7(a)\npresents the superimposition of the ligands from these binding sites on the query protein. No ligand information was used during the search and each ligand is superimposed onto the structure of the query protein using the transformation obtained by the alignment between the database-binding site and the query protein.

In order to show that the query site was successfully located on the surface of each protein, we present the values of the RMSD which were calculated between the locations of the ligands oleic acid, palmitic acid, retinol and retinoic acid present in the query-binding sites extracted from 1lid, 2ifb, lopb, and lcbs, respectively. For each pairwise alignment the RMSD is calculated between the location of the ligand obtained by SiteEngine and the location of the same ligand obtained by the alignment of the backbones (C\u03b1 atoms) of the complete structures. Although no ligand information was used by SiteEngine, it can be seen that the RMSD values in most of the cases are very low. The extreme exception is the alignment of the binding site of 2ifb to the structure of 1lfo. The structure of the liver fatty acid-binding protein is very different from the rest of the family members due to the fact that more than one fatty acid is bound.58 The structural alignment by C\u03b1 atoms leads to an RMSD of 8.2 \u00c5 between the oleate ligand of 1lfo and palmitic acid of 2ifb. SiteEngine aligns these ligands with an RMSD of only 5.5 \u00c5 and it correctly detects the primary-binding site of 1lfo. It must be noted that these results were achieved in spite of the fact that only one best solution was considered for each pairwise alignment.",

In these cases, there is no exact definition for the similarity between two binding sites. A query-binding region may contain features that are not essential for the binding, which may differ in proteins with exactly the same function. The absence of an exact definition of the pattern we are looking for makes the evaluation of such partial solutions even more complicated. Considering the superimposition between the ligands obtained by an alignment between unrelated proteins can also be misleading. Similar binding sites may accommodate ligands that differ in their size and shape and it is not clear what should be the correct superimposition between them. Figure 8(a)\npresents an alignment between the ATP ligands of the hexamerization domain of N-ethylmaleimide sensitive factor (1nsf) and cAMP-dependent protein kinase (1atp) obtained by the alignment of the corresponding binding sites. As can be seen in the Figure, the superimposition of the ligand molecules achieves a good alignment between the ribose parts of the ATP molecules while the orientation of the adenine moieties is different. However, when the binding sites are artificially superimposed using the transformation that aligns the adenine moieties, the distance between the phosphate tails of the ATP molecules is approximately 20 \u00c5 and only six pseudocenters are identified to be similar (as opposed to nine pseudocenters identified by SiteEngine). Therefore, it is not straightforward to identify which solution is the correct one, especially due to the fact that the adenine moiety is known to exhibit two different binding modes.10\nFigure 8(b) presents an alignment between the NAD and ATP ligands of lactate dehydrogenase (9ldt) and the hypothetical protein MJ0577(1mjh) obtained by the alignment of the corresponding binding sites. Once again, the alignment between the binding sites of the proteins provides an alignment between the ribose parts of the NAD and ATP ligand molecules. However, the adenine ring of the ATP is aligned to the nicotinamide ring of NAD (and not to an adenine ring as expected). This solution provides the alignment of 13 similar centers of interaction shared by these binding regions. Moreover, there are two residues (1mjh, His40, Val142; 9ldt, His195, Val32) that are present in both binding sites and have the same spatial locations as well as identity of the amino acid. Since SiteEngine is a software tool it recognizes regions that maximize the similarity; however, it cannot assess the biological significance of the obtained predictions. These need to be further verified by physical experiments and human expertise.",

We have illustrated this application by searching the database with a complete structure of a fatty acid-binding protein.

However, the ranking of binding sites of different size according to their similarity to different regions on the surface of the complete protein is not straightforward. In this work, the ranking was done according to how much of the database-binding site was matched during the search. However, some binding sites received a high rank due to their small size and the fact that some surface patterns have a high probability of appearance on the surface of any protein structure.

These binding sites were correctly located on the surfaces of these proteins and the performance of SiteEngine in these cases was similar to the five top-ranking solutions presented in Table 1. It is interesting to note that only five of the recognized adenine-binding sites are complexed with adenine, while the rest are unbound or accommodate other ligands. Ranked 19 is the correctly recognized binding site of a replication factor C (1iqp) that accommodates an ADP molecule. Figure 9(a)\nshows the correct recognition of this site and Figure 9(b) presents an additional binding site of d-Ala-d-Ala ligase (1iow) that accommodates an ADP molecule and is ranked 31.

Figure 10(a)\npresents the alignment of the binding site of 1o97 to the query. As can be seen, the binding sites are extremely similar and the ligands are perfectly aligned. The recognized similarity of the binding sites in addition to the similarity of the overall structures of these proteins can suggest similarity of their functions. Figure 10(b) presents another example, ranked 7, where SiteEngine has recognized a similarity to an ADP-binding site of arsenite-translocating ATPase ArsA (1ihu). Although the alignment of an ADP substrate of this protein to the ATP of the query is not very good, we have obtained a good alignment of the binding sites as well as of some secondary structure elements. While this protein is classified to a different fold than the query, the similarity, of the secondary structure elements superimposed by the transformation of SiteEngine suggests that the obtained alignment is correct and can assist in deciphering the function of this protein. Another surprising result of this search is the consistency of our presumably false-positive results to what was observed on our benchmark dataset. Six out of 15 top-ranking solutions of this search are oxidoreductases. The alignments obtained in these cases are similar to the one presented in Figure 8(b).

In both cases, these two solutions were followed by a hypothetical protein YggV (1k7k). Although extremely similar to the query, this protein is also a part of the Structural Genomics project and its function is unknown. When searched with a bound form of MJ0226 (2mjp), ranked 4 is a binding site of autoinducer-2 production protein LuxS (1j6w) and ranked 5 is a tandem phosphatase domain of RPTP LAR (1lar). Ranked 6 is a binding site of adenylate kinase with the substrate-mimicking inhibitor Ap5A. This inhibitor can be considered as an ATP molecule coupled to an AMP molecule via the additional phosphate group and its interaction with the protein shows the pathway of phosphoryl transfer.72 SiteEngine has recognized a high degree of similarity of the regions that interact with the phosphate groups, which are aligned by the calculated transformation. A similar alignment is also recognized with the GNP-binding site of a G protein gialphal (1cip, ranked 27), presented in Figure 10(c). This result seems consistent with the suggestion by Hwang et al.71 that this protein can function similarly to the signal sorters of G-proteins. When searched with an unbound form of MJ0226 (1b78), the ranking of the results (other than the top three) is slightly different due to the differences of the surfaces of the bound and unbound forms. Ranked 4 is a copper amine oxidase (1ivw), ranked 5 is a tryptophan indol-lyase (1ax4) and ranked 6 is a farnesyl diphosphate synthase (1uby). Figure 10(d) illustrates the result that is ranked 31, in which we recognize similarity to a UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine-d-glutamate (MurD) ligase (2uag). The obtained alignment of the binding sites provides a superimposition of the ANP substrate of the query to a nucleotide precursor UDP-N-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine (UMA). As can be seen, the rings of the two ligands participate in similar aromatic interactions with a phenyl residue that is present in both binding sites. In total, these binding sites share three residues (1b78 Asn19, Asp73, Phe149, and 2uag Asn138, Asp35, Phe422) that have the same spatial location and identity.",

            "text": "Other limitations that influence the quality of the results are implied by the screening applications and are general to the problem. One is the absence of a clear definition of what exactly is a functional site and what are the features that define it. When the binding site is defined by its contacts with the smaller ligand, a significant amount of information may be missed. As a result, essential features might be ignored and the extracted pattern might be partially aligned to other functionally different binding sites. There is no simple automatic solution to this problem. One possibility is the construction of a database of consensus binding patterns, common to all proteins with the same function. Another problem is assessing the statistical significance of the obtained results. These are strongly influenced by the number of functional sites of the same type present in the searched database. Although the ASTRAL dataset provides a non-redundant coverage of protein structures, it contains many redundancies of functional sites. In order to provide a truly representative statistical evaluation it is essential to consider a non-redundant dataset of functional sites, the construction of which is a future challenge. In order to efficiently address these problems there is a need for methods for multiple structural alignments between binding sites. In the future, we intend to utilize the insights we have gained in the present method for the development of such algorithms.",
