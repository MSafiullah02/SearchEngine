Country-specific rotavirus disease burden data are important for informing decisions regarding rotavirus vaccine introduction into National Immunisation Programmes. However use of passive surveillance data alone has been shown to underestimate rotavirus disease burden in Hong Kong [2], highlighting the need for active rotavirus surveillance [3]. The first phase of the Asian Rotavirus Surveillance Network (ARSN) used a WHO surveillance protocol and was conducted in China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, South Korea, Taiwan, Thailand and Vietnam between 2001 and 2003 [3], [4]. Overall 30\u201355% of hospitalizations for diarrhoea in children aged less than 5 years were due to rotavirus [4], with Hong Kong reporting the lowest percentage (30%) [3]. These Hong Kong rotavirus admissions were associated with significant health care and societal costs [5], and an economic evaluation using a Markov model and 2002 cost assumptions estimated that the introduction of routine rotavirus vaccination at a cost of US$40\u201392 per course could be potentially cost-saving from a government perspective alone [6].",

Corresponding reductions in all-cause gastroenteritis admissions have been in the region of 35% [20]. Universal rotavirus vaccination may also reduce nosocomial infections [21], and provide indirect protection to unvaccinated older children and adults [22]. Although rotavirus vaccines were licensed in Hong Kong in 2006, they have not been included in the territory's universal childhood immunisation programme. The proportion of Hong Kong children that receive rotavirus vaccine through the private sector is unknown.",

However after applying adjustment factors 1, 2 and 3 (derived from laboratory data from one hospital) these estimates increased to 863, 1093 and 1029 respectively, indicating the potential magnitude of under-coding and/or under-testing. Stool specimens were actively collected at four hospitals during the two-year period 2001\u20132003 as part of the Asian Rotavirus Surveillance Network (ARSN) [4]. We previously reported for children below 5 years of age rotavirus incidence rates per 100,000 of 810\u2013880 during this two-year active surveillance period [3]. The corresponding CMS rotavirus diagnosis incidence during this same two-year period was 300 per 100,000. Although our current analysis includes data from the ARSN study period, our results suggest that the adjusted rotavirus incidence estimates were similar during the same period but trended up during the subsequent rotavirus seasons (Fig. 2). The current analysis suggests that between 1.7% (unadjusted CMS diagnosis of rotavirus at one hospital), 2.6% (laboratory confirmed rotavirus confirmed at one hospital), and 3.4% (1.7% \u00d7 2.02) (CMS diagnosis adjusted for under-diagnosis and under-testing with adjustment factor 2) of hospital admissions below 5 years of age were due to rotavirus infection. The ARSN surveillance data estimated a cumulative risk of admission by five years of age of 4.2% (1 in 24 children) [3]. Estimates of cumulative risk of admission by five years of age from the current analysis ranged from 1.4% (1 in 69 children) to 4.5% (1 in 22 children) during the 11 year period from 1 April 2000 to 31 March 2011 (Fig. 3\n).

            "text": "A number of assumptions have been made that should be considered when interpreting our results. First our incidence estimates assumed the proportion of admissions to public HA hospitals and the resident Hong Kong population was constant over the entire study period. In our previous analyses it was assumed that public hospitals catered for 90% of paediatric admissions and that all Hong Kong births utilised the Hong Kong health system [3]. However in recent years there have been two significant changes that challenge these assumptions. With improvements in the economy since the 1997 economic downturn, there has been an increased use of private hospital facilities (Appendix 1). Second there has been a significant increase in the number of cross-border births and these have accounted for up to 50% of all Hong Kong births in recent years. All children born in Hong Kong are eligible to obtain a Hong Kong identity card and access to Hong Kong medical care. There is limited data on the subsequent residence and health care utilisation of these cross border births i.e. some live with parent(s)/relatives in Hong Kong and others return to live in the Mainland, but still potentially seeking medical care in Hong Kong. PWH is in close proximity to the Hong Kong-Mainland border and likely caters for a greater proportion of children moving frequently to-and-fro for medical care, than do other more distant HA hospitals. These limitations mean that our incidence estimates (Table 2) are likely under-estimates rather than over-estimates since they exclude rotavirus admissions to hospitals in mainland China. However countering this is the fact that this analysis did not determine the proportion of children readmitted for the same diarrheal episode and those with nosocomial rotavirus infection, factors that could result in an overestimation of incidence. Also our adjustment for under-testing (adjustment factor 2) assumed that the rotavirus positive rate in untested stools was equal to that in tested stools and could therefore over-estimate true incidence since it is possible that children who are not tested have more mild disease and lower likelihood of rotavirus infection. Population census data were mid-year estimates (January to December), whereas the rotavirus admission data was calculated by rotavirus season (July to the following June). We have also assumed that the adjustment factors derived from one institution, PWH, can be applied uniformly across all the HA hospitals, and that these factors are stable over time. This may not be a valid assumption. Although PWH is one of the largest HA hospitals and one of the two university teaching hospitals in Hong Kong, it accounts for only about 10% of all the public hospital paediatric admissions. It is possible that there may be differences in clinical practices, admission policies and laboratory services between PWH and other HA hospitals and also over time. During the period 2001 to 2003 PWH was one of four HA hospitals to participate in active rotavirus surveillance as part of the ARSN, and it is likely that testing for rotavirus is more frequent at PWH than at some of the other HA hospitals. Ideally having laboratory data from other sentinel surveillance hospitals, that have a policy of routine testing for rotavirus, could strengthen our incidence estimates in future studies.",

Possible reasons for this could include the limited use of vaccine within the private sector. Increased awareness of rotavirus following the ARSN active surveillance period (2001\u20132003) and increased surveillance and infection control measures for respiratory and diarrhoeal diseases following the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2003, could have contributed to the increased testing for rotavirus during the latter part of the study period and improved accuracy of CMS coding. More permissive admission policies could be another explanation for the increased trends in incidence of rotavirus and all-cause gastroenteritis observed.",
