            "text": "Breast cancer, one of the most common cancer in women, is globally diagnosed by physical examination, breast scan and tissue biopsies. A total of 2.089 million new cases of breast cancer were identified in 2018, of which \u223c627,000 cases died. This accounted for approximately 15% of all cancer deaths among women globally [1]. In 2018, the highest numbers of breast cancer cases were reported from Asia (9,11,014) followed by Europe (5,22,512), North America (2,62,347), Latin America and Caribbean (199,734), Africa (1,68,690) and Oceania (24,551) [1]. Although very common in women, breast cancer rarely occurs in men [2]. A vast heterogeneity in breast cancer molecular profiling has been reported [3]. Based on the ER/PR and HER2 expression, breast cancer can be of 4 types: (i) ER/PR+, HER2+; (ii) ER/PR\u2212, HER2+; (iii) ER/PR+, HER2\u2212; and (iv) ER/PR\u2212, HER2\u2212 [4]. The most aggressive breast cancer is ER/PR\u2212, HER2\u2212 (also called triple negative breast cancer, TNBC) because no receptor is present on these tumors. It is estimated that 70% of the breast cancers are hormone receptor positive (70%) and can be treated with corresponding therapies [5,6]. In addition to hormone receptors, other biomarkers used for clinical, pathological and molecular characterization of breast cancer include Ki67, p53, CA153, CEA, BRCA1/BRCA2 etc. [7]. These molecular biomarkers in breast cancer are used for diagnosis, staging and grading, therapeutic intervention, prognosis as well as clinical management of recurrent and metastatic cases [8].",

            "text": "Unlike a decade ago, clinicians today have multiple choices for breast cancer treatment depending on the size, stage, grade, metastatic behavior, aggressiveness and intrinsic molecular subtyping of tumor, age, menopausal status, overall health, comorbidities, and preferences of the patient [[9], [10], [11], [12], [13]]. Chemotherapy, hormone therapy, immunotherapy, radiotherapy, and surgery are the common modalities for breast cancer [10,14]. Primary choice of treatment usually includes surgery with the aim of complete resection of the major tumor mass on the first hand. Breast conserving (lumpectomy) and breast reconstruction surgeries, mastectomy or lymph node dissections are performed initially in the breast cancer patients [15]. Surgery may be preceded with the systemic neoadjuvant therapies in order to shrink the tumor for effective surgery and to maximize breast conservation. For example, in HER2+ cases, Trastuzumab (Herceptin) and Pertuzumab (Perjeta) are given as neoadjuvant therapy and only Trastuzumab is continued post-surgery [16,17]. Surgery is mostly followed by chemotherapy or radiotherapy to further destroy the remnant micrometastatic cancer cells that have escaped the breast or lymph nodes, to decrease the chances of recurrence and to increase the overall patient survival [14,15]. The adjuvant (additional) therapies i.e. hormone or targeted therapy are provided to breast cancer patients depending on the expression of hormone receptor or target protein, respectively [9]. The ER/PR + breast cancer patients are given tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitor together or alternatively after the surgical resection [18,19]. Likewise, trastuzumab (herceptin) is mostly recommended to the HER2+ breast cancer patients [20]. TNBC patients are difficult to treat, with unfavorable prognosis and are generally administered with the standard chemotherapy along with the PARP inhibitors or the DNA-targeting platinum drug (carboplatin) [21,22]. Another strategy is based on the holistic approach of patient recovery i.e. complementary and alternative medicine. In the holistic approach, the patients are advised for several life style changes like exercise, yoga, meditation, acupuncture and/or Ayurvedic treatments in addition to the standard therapies [23].",

Repositioning of old drugs offer rapid transition from bench to bedside as already approved by FDA and other regulatory norms, passed through the clinical trials and are approved for human use. These drugs have well defined pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, dose, side effects, metabolic profiles and targeted molecular pathway etc [29,34]. Here, the clinical development can directly start from the phase II trial to assess the efficacy for new indication/disease target. The successful example of drug repositioning includes Sildenafil (Viagra) and Thalidomide. Viagra was originally launched for hypertension and angina pectoris patients by Pfizer (1980). However, the patients developed penile erections as side effects in phase I clinical trial. The drug was later developed for erectile dysfunctions. In 2012, the total sale of Viagra was 2.05 billion dollars [35]. Similarly, the sedative thalidomide was serendipitously repurposed for erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) in 1964 and for multiple myeloma and other cancers in 1999 [[36], [37], [38], [39]].",

            "text": "Recent advances in genomics, proteomics, transcriptomics and metabolomics have provided vast and deep knowledge about the molecular and metabolic alterations that occurs in cancers. The fundamentals of drug repurposing through the integration of system biology and bioinformatics depends on basic concepts i.e. activity based and in silico drug discovery [40]. Activity based drug repurposing is the experimental approach where the drug candidate is evaluated for the anti-cancer activity directly. The drug that is structurally similar would tend to have similar target, shared biological activity and indications [41]. In the two diseases where same metabolic pathway or signaling is affected, then the drugs that target the specific pathway can be used in both of the diseases irrespective of their structural dissimilarity [26,42]. The drug that shows strong efficiency for any off-target (side effect) in one disease can be explored further i.e. the off-target binding and effect can be used as the novel indication of that drug in some other disease [[43], [44], [45]]. In silico drug repurposing approach is based on the association and/or overlaps in the disease-gene-drug paradigm. The large data about drug-disease, gene expression (microarrays) or protein-protein interactions or gene-protein interactions or signaling pathway mapping, signature matching, genome-wide association studies (GWAS) can be used for providing drug-disease gene association networking by the systematic integration and coordination of computation and bioinformatics, modeling (such as docking for structural modeling), experimentation, statistics, machine learning etc. [[46], [47], [48], [49]]. The various data resources are available that can be used for bio-informatics based exploration followed by experimental validation for any drug repurposing possibilities in any disease. The similar gene expression profile for drug phenotype in patients with different diseases as mapped by connectivity map (cMap), Library Integrated Network based Cellular Signatures (LINCS), expression signatures may have similar therapeutic applications [[50], [51], [52]]. Other important public data resources that are used for network-based drug repositioning includes gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) for drug-drug similarity network [53]; DrugBank [54], online mendelian inheritance in men (OMIM) [55] and GEO [56] for predicting drug-disease network; KEGG [57], STRING [58], BioGrid [59], HAPPI [60] and Reactome [61] for pathway and/or protein-protein interactions; STITCH drug-gene/protein database [62,63], TTD therapeutic target database [64], SFINX for drug-drug interactions [65]; and SIDER for drug side effects [66]. Also, the recently reported \u2018Drug Repurposing from Control System theory (DeCoST)\u2019 is a comprehensive platform for drug repurposing that encompasses various limitations in the previous databases like variation in number of copies of gene of interest, mutations, lack of reference for normal range of gene expression etc. in different diseases [67]. Vigorously exploited \u2018network-based approach\u2019 by integrating the mentioned resources for identifying potential target, pathway and drug has been reported as the most potential way for drug repositioning [68].",

It shows the biphasic effect i.e. at low doses it imparts the immuno-suppressive function and at higher doses it functions as an alkylating agent leading to the death of tumour as well as the lymphoid cells [69,70]. Usually 600 mg/m\u00b2 cyclophosphamide is intravenously (IV) administered to breast cancer patients in combination with other chemotherapeutics (Docetaxel, Paclitaxel, Doxorubicin). The recommended regimens for robustly healthy breast cancer patients include 6 cycles of cyclophosphamide, methotrexate and 5-fluorouracil (CMF) or 4 cycles of adriamycin and cyclophosphamide (AC) [71,72].",

Some of the common anthracyclins are doxorubicin, daunorubicin, epirubicin and idarubicin. These are generally extracted from Streptomyces bacterium. Approved for medical use in 1974, doxorubicin (14-hydroxylated version of Daunorubicin) [79] was originally extracted from Streptomyces peucetius [80]. There was a long lapse of 20 years between first clinical usages of anthracyclins to their proven relevance in breast cancer treatment. However, once established the chemotherapeutic regimens that contained doxorubicin [usual dose: 60\u201375 mg/m\u00b2 intravenously (IV) every 21 days] were used regularly with dose-intense and dose-dense schedules. Some of the regimens containing doxorubicin are AC (adriamycin, cyclophosphamide), TAC (taxotere, AC) and FAC (5-fluorouracil, AC) [81]. Unlike doxil (the PEGylated form of doxorubucin), myocet is the non-PEGylated liposomal version of doxorubicin that is approved for treatment of metastatic breast cancer in combination with cyclophosphamide in Europe and Canada [82].",

Therefore, 5-FU not only inhibits the DNA synthesis in the cell but also inhibits RNA synthesis due to FdUTP incorporation in RNA; leading to highly toxic effects on the growth of rapidly multiplying cells like cancer cells. Klein and colleagues introduced 5-FU for medical use in 1962 for the treatment of self-healing, squamous cell tumors of skin i.e. keratoacanthomas (KAs) [83]. 5-FU was subsequently used for other cancer types including breast cancer [84]. General drug dosage of 5-FU is 500 mg/m2 or 600 mg/m2 IV on day 1 and day 8 of every 28-day cycle (six cycles in total). Lokich et al (1985) first introduced the infusion of 5-FU in combination with methotrexate (M) for breast cancer [85]. Since then various regimes of combination therapy containing 5-FU (F) with other drugs like doxorubicin (A), cisplatin (C), cyclophosphamide (CX) and epirubicin (E) (ECF, CMF, CAF) have been continuously used for treating metastatic breast cancer [86]. The other combinations such as 5-FU with paclitaxel in 1998 [87] and high dose 5-FU/paclitaxel with doxorubicin [88] were found successful for breast cancer treatment.",

Folic acid is converted to dihydrofolate by DHFR, which is then reduced to tetrahydrofolate (THDF) for further action by thymidine synthetase. Methotrexate binding to DHFR decreases the synthesis of purines and pyrimidines in the cells that inhibits the cell cycle progression in S-phase. Methotrexate was discovered in 1940s as a substitute to folic acid, because the cases with decreased leukemic cell count (acute lymphoblastic leukemia) due to dietary deficiency of folic acid were being presented in clinics [89,90]. Methotrexate was first shown to remit breast cancer in 1951 by Jane C Wright [91]. In 1960s and 1970s, methotrexate was being used as single cytotoxic agent for advanced breast cancer treatment [92]. However, Gianni and Bonadonna group (1976) showed the first treatment with 12 cycles of CMF combination in 400 mastectomised women with advanced cancer and positive lymph nodes and reported only 5.3% treatment failure with acceptable toxicity [93,94]. In fact, CMF regimen was the first ever schedule for breast cancer treatment. Further, CMF was found to be equally effective even at 6 cycles. Immunosuppressive activity of Methotrexate has been explored for its clinical use in autoimmune diseases like rheumatoid arthritis [95]. General dosage of CMF regimen is defined as 6\u20138 cycles of cyclophosphamide (600 mg/m2); methotrexate (40 mg/m2), and fluorouracil (600 mg/m2) at 14-day intervals.",

The drug was also used against CVB3, EV71, human rhinoviruses (HRVs), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis C virus (HCV), poliovirus, influenza virus, ZIKV and MERS-CoV [104,105]. It was then pre-clinically tested for its anti-tumour attribute. The drug was approved by FDA for pancreatic cancer in 1995 [106] and for non-small lung cancer in 1998 [107]. Finally, Gemcitabine was approved for metastatic breast cancer in 2004 in combination with paclitaxel [108,109]. After anthracycline-containing adjuvant chemotherapy failure, gemcitabine (1250 mg/m\u00b2 IV infusion over 30 min on Days 1 and 8 of each 21-day cycle) and paclitaxel (175 mg/m\u00b2 on Day 1 as a 3 h infusion before gemcitabine) combination is used as the first-line of treatment against metastatic cancer. Other combinations such as gemcitabine/vinorelbine (GemVin), gemcitabine/cisplatin (GemCis), gemcitabine/capecitabine (GemCap) have also shown increased response rate and overall survival in pretreated metastatic breast cancer patients [110].",

This is because the disease demands molecular dissection at gene and protein level to find newer strategies, appropriate targets and corresponding drugs. This requires a lot of time and the use of high-end techniques by pharmaceutical companies thereby increasing the overall financial investments and eventually the cost of the drug [135]. The antibody-based immunotherapies or cell-based CART therapy, DC vaccine, ACT types of drug treatment might prove promising. However, these therapies are unaffordable by most patients in developed as well as developing countries. This necessitates the development of drugs with higher efficacy, lower side effects and practically lower cost. One of the smart ways is to repurpose an old, existing and approved drug for a newer indication. The advantage of this approach is that the approved drugs have existing information about molecular targets, off- targets, modes of action, safety level and side effects. This would not only save a lot of time that is otherwise required for discovery, designing, clinical trials and approvals of a new drug but also reduce the overall cost of anti-cancer drug. This will cut the cost involved in preclinical development and phase I trial. Further, the old drugs would be off-patent and hence cheaper than the initial costs.",

Bioinformatics tools revealed that the BACH1 expression is significantly elevated in TNBC and the Hemin sensitizes the TNBC to metformin-mediated degradation of BACH1 [136]. The completion of repurposing drug in oncology (ReDO) project has provided evidence for the new uses of 6 drugs for breast cancer.

            "text": "However, some challenges and concerns associated with drug repurposing for breast cancer therapy require thorough consideration. The breast tumor heterogeneity, poorly defined molecular signatures, and poorly identified drug dosage provides a roadblock to the drug repurposing. Moreover, the current strategies often ignore tumor grade. It is crucial to search the new therapeutic strategies for certain very stringent and hard to treat molecular subgroups of breast cancers such as basal subtype, TNBC, MBC and tumors resistant to standard treatment therapy. The molecular alterations in TNBC, MBC, and resistant tumor types should also be thoroughly investigated. Aforementioned BACH1 inhibition by targeting the energy generating mechanism of rapidly growing cells is indeed the novel approach against otherwise resistant- breast cancer. Understanding and targeting the tumour microenvironment instead of tumor itself appears more promising in detailing the heterogeneity in breast cancer patients. The overlapping area that consists of tumour and normal cells in tumor microenvironment should be thoroughly characterized at the molecular level [142,143]. Identifying the molecular basis of super-responders and non-responders also holds valuable insight for deeper exploration [144]. Another area that needs attention while strategizing drug repositioning for breast cancer is personalized medicine i.e. to extend the repositioning strategy to treat upto single patient design, as the patients under same molecular subgroup often presents further variations leading to unexpected response. Structurally similar drugs may, at times, target functionally dissimilar protein hence pathway driven repurposing strategy is better for multi-targeted diseases like cancer. The orphan drugs generally have short or no patent and thus repurposing them is associated with lower cost. Repurposing the off-patent drugs eventually blocks the patenting rights on repurposed drug and hence future investors [145]. Inclusion and exclusion criteria for the selection of trial group for repurposed drug is very crucial as different physiological responses are anticipated in comparison to the original group. For example, the pregnant women (first trimester) with cancer are excluded for thalidomide treatment due to risk of Amelia and phocomelia [146]. Drug companies that expand the repositioning in similar therapeutic areas, such as reusing ovarian cancer drug as breast cancer drug, had success rate of 67% in comparison to 33% success rate when explored in different area [147]. A comprehensive, large-scale data mining and research is required before jumping on to actual repurposing procedure in order to save the time and finances because smallest of errors in computation or simulations can mislead the entire study. Faultless selection of most relevant pharmacological target using most appropriate database (TCGA and METABRIC) for data mining and accurate repurposing strategy is indispensable for the successful drug repositioning for breast cancer. Repurposed drugs mainly include the Phase III clinical trial, which still is the most challenging phase due to the longest duration, huge investments and inclusion of largest number of patients as compared to the Phase I and Phase II clinical trials. The repurposed drug for breast cancers usually does not work in monotherapy but as poly-pharmacology/combinations. The PARP inhibitors are synthetic lethal with BRAC2 mutation [148]. Hence, initially proving the repurposed drug efficacy as single drug agent becomes difficult. The toxicity of repurposed drug in pretreated patients or in combination therapy is unknown. For example, Valproate-doxorubicin treatment caused toxicity-induced death of two patients in a group of 16 cancer patients [149]. The overall success rate of development of new drugs (6%) and repositioning of drugs does not vary much as the ultimate efficacy remains same [150]. Also, the repositioned drug anyhow requires clinical re-assessment for optimizing its efficacy and cytotoxicity if the route of administration or drug dosage is different from the older indication; thereby increasing the overall cost of repositioning scheme. Nonetheless, the animal model used for drug testing does not represent the exact patient phenotype and hence is less predictive of efficacy in real [151]. Despite many benefits of drug repositioning, much attention is required to lower the drug dosage and toxicity without mitigating efficacy and resolve above discussed limitations for cost effective and more efficient drug development.",
