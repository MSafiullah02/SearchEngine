            "text": "Introduction 1 2 At the time of this writing, the novel coronavirus COVID-19 is widely spreading as one in a 3 century pandemic 1 with significant health implications and is responsible for over a million 4 infections worldwide 2-4 . At least 5% of those infected have become critically ill, developing 5 acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) complicated by acute kidney injury and multi-organ 6 failure 5, 6 . Many of these patients require central venous access for renal replacement therapy 7 (RRT). Obtaining access, however, can be complicated by the prone positioning that often 8 employed for the management of severe ARDS. Here we present a case such as this and propose 9 a novel solution to this complex access scenario. In light of these considerations, we elected to place a 50 cm dialysis catheter in this patient's 17 left popliteal vein. Under ultrasound guidance (Figures 1 a &b) , the left popliteal vein was 18 accessed in the popliteal fossa using a micro-puncture technique. We prefer examining the 19 popliteal vein in both cross-sectional and longitudinal access so may avoid any valve and taking 20 care not to injure the tibial nerve which is located superficially neither popliteal artery which is 21 the deepest structure in the popliteal Fossa. A 4 Fr micropuncture sheath was placed, and a stiff 22",

(Figures 2 a, b &c) The 50 cm dialysis catheter (Figure 3 ) was fully advanced. The 1 catheter was then sutured in place, and both ports were flushed easily. At this point, CRRT was 2 immediately initiated without difficulty. The patient ultimately recovered and was transferred out 3 of the ICU several days later. There may be disadvantages to using popliteal venous access for RRT, as well. First, this 17 method of access is highly operator dependent, requiring familiarity with the anatomy of the 18 popliteal fossa and comfort using ultrasound. Secondly, there is a risk of provoking lower 19 extremity deep vein thrombosis with this method, although the risk is presumably similar to that 20 of developing upper extremity or internal jugular catheter-associated DVT. Finally, this method 21 requires the use of a longer dialysis catheter in order to reach the deep central veins, which may 22 limit high flow rates during RRT. In our limited experience, however, we have not found these 1 problems to be significant. 2 3",

            "text": "is a 67-year-old male who initially presented to our facility with acute 14 respiratory failure secondary to COVID-19. Soon after arrival at our facility, the patient 15 decompensated, developing severe ARDS requiring intubation and prone positioning to maintain 16 adequate oxygenation. Over the next few days, the patient developed acute kidney injury with 17 oliguria and severe volume overload. The vascular surgery service was consulted to obtain 18 central venous access for emergent CRRT. Upon our exam, the patient was sedated and 19 paralyzed in a rotating prone-positioning bed. He could not be positioned supine without 20 immediately becoming hypoxic and decompensating. first choice for access in critically ill patients requiring RRT is the internal 2 jugular vein. If the internal jugular veins are not available, our second and third choices for 3 access are the common femoral veins and subclavian veins, respectively. This patient, like many 4 others with severe ARDS from COVID-19, presented a number of barriers to obtaining access 5 for RRT in the acute setting. First, prone positioning eliminates access to the common femoral 6 veins and subclavian veins and makes obtaining internal jugular venous access significantly 7 more challenging, elevating the risk of iatrogenic pneumothorax. Secondly, the close proximity 8 of the internal jugular veins to the patient's airway jeopardizes the dialysis nurses and ancillary 9 staff by increasing their exposure to airway secretions and aerosolized particles, resulting in a 10 heightened risk of viral transmission. Finally, many patients with COVID-19 have required 11 prolonged treatment in the ICU setting, worsening the development of long-term central venous 12 stenosis with internal jugular or subclavian dialysis catheters.",

First, the popliteal vein is easily accessible in patient requiring prone positioning 10 in the setting of severe ARDS, while the internal jugular, femoral, and subclavian veins are not. 11 Secondly, using the popliteal vein for access physically distances medical personnel from the 12 patient's upper airway, reducing transmission of the virus. Finally, using lower extremity access 13 for RRT limits the development of catheter-induced SVC and upper extremity central venous 14 stenosis, which are known to cause long-term AV access failure. 15 16",
