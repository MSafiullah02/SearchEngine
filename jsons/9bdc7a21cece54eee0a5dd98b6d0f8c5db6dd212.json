Rising to this challenge requires organizing ecological information derived from diverse sources and formally assimilating data with models of ecological processes. The study of infectious disease has depended on strategies for integrating patterns of observed disease incidence with mechanistic process models since John Snow first mapped cholera cases around a London water pump in 1854. Still, zoonotic and vector-borne diseases increasingly affect human populations, and methods used to successfully characterize directly transmitted diseases are often insufficient. We use four case studies to demonstrate that advances in disease forecasting require better understanding of zoonotic host and vector populations, as well of the dynamics that facilitate pathogen amplification and disease spillover into humans. In each case study, this goal is complicated by limited data, spatiotemporal variability in pathogen transmission and impact, and often, insufficient biological understanding. We present a conceptual framework for data-model fusion in infectious disease research that addresses these fundamental challenges using a hierarchical state-space structure to (1) integrate multiple data sources and spatial scales to inform latent parameters, (2) partition uncertainty in process and observation models, and (3) explicitly build upon existing ecological and epidemiological understanding. Given the constraints inherent in the study of infectious disease and the urgent need for progress, fusion of data and expertise via this type of conceptual framework should prove an indispensable tool.",

In the 19th century, John Snow (1855) systematically traced cholera mortalities to a shared London water pump in what is now often recognized as the first published epidemiological study (Evans 1976 ). At the time, Snow and his contemporaries were largely unaware of the ecological dynamics that led naturally occurring aquatic bacteria (Vibrio cholerae) to cause epidemic disease. Snow used scientific inquiry based on observations and an implicit spatiotemporal clustering model to demonstrate a connection between cholera cases and water supplies. Today we know that V. cholerae occurs naturally in copepod hosts across many aquatic environments (Colwell 1996) and that the ecology of these copepod communities is an essential component of managing and forecasting cholera epidemics in humans (Lipp et al. 2002 , Colwell et al. 2003 .",

The availability of data and advances in technology in just the past few decades have greatly enhanced our ability to evaluate the ecological dynamics of infectious disease (e.g., Glass et al. 2000 , Ostfeld et al. 2006 and have fostered tremendous progress in dynamic modeling of disease processes (Ferguson et al. 2001 , Keeling et al. 2003 , Ferrari et al. 2008 , Smith et al. 2008 , He et al. 2010 . However, even with the extraordinary advances in data availability, computational power, and algorithms for stochastic modeling, fusing data with mechanistic understanding in ways that Manuscript , Kitron et al. 2006 , Glass 2007 , and is especially problematic in the case of emergent infectious diseases. Emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) are caused by pathogens that have been newly identified (e.g., human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] , severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS] , Lyme disease, H5N1 influenza), have undergone range expansions into na\u0131\u00a8ve populations (e.g., West Nile virus, Dengue fever), or have evolved into more virulent or drug resistant strains (e.g., drugresistant malaria and tuberculosis) (Woolhouse and Dye 2001) . Several recent studies have demonstrated that reported EIDs have increased in recent decades and that a majority of EIDs are zoonotic (vertebrate reservoir) and vector-borne (Taylor et al. 2001 , Wilcox and Gubler 2005 , Jones et al. 2008 . Following declines in the mid-20th century, mortalities in the United States attributed to infectious diseases began to rise in the 1980s, an increase that has been blamed on the spread of HIV and related infections (reviewed by Greger 2007) . It is likely that exponential growth of the human population and human resource consumption (Daszak et al. 2000) , globalization of travel and trade (Karesh et al. 2005) , and changes in climate (Pascual and Bouma 2009) have already and will continue to facilitate this rise in EIDs.",

Available data are often discrete, while the underlying processes are continuous in nature. Numerous approaches have been employed to estimate transmission rates and predict disease intensity from observed disease incidence (i.e., successful transmission events for a fixed spatial and temporal interval). A majority of advances in understanding infectious dynamics have been made in endemic diseases with direct human-to-human transmission because data and understanding of human population dynamics are generally available (Anderson and May 1992 , Bolker and Grenfell 1995 , Ferrari et al. 2008 , He et al. 2010 . Systems that include zoonotic reservoir hosts and vector transmission are more complex than directly transmitted human diseases and require some understanding of the ecological dynamics controlling host and vector populations, as well as the factors that influence disease incidence (Yates et al. 2002 , Ostfeld et al. 2006 , Begon et al. 2009 ). Sick animals are not easily studied in their natural environment and the historical time series that have supported many advances in infectious disease research (e.g., Anderson and May 1992) do not exist for wildlife populations or for newly emergent diseases.",

            "text": "A primary goal of compartmental modeling in epidemiology is estimation of the basic reproductive number, R 0 , the number of new infections created by a single infected individual in a wholly susceptible population. Theoretically, an epidemic can only proceed if R 0 is greater than 1 (Anderson and May 1985) . The parameter estimates that characterize disease transmission can be adjusted to explore how changes in these rates alter the probability that an epidemic will occur as well as its probable duration. Dynamic compartmental models can be valuable tools for assessing the relative importance of critical rates and have been crucial for evaluating vaccination strategies (Anderson and May1985) and controlling emerging human epidemics such as SARS, which we review later. The mathematical structure reflects several underlying biological assumptions, including the nature of transmission and the constancy of rate parameters in time and space. When these assumptions are not correct then the resulting R 0 values can be off by orders of magnitude (e.g., Wonham et al. 2006) . Limitations associated with mathematical modeling of infectious transmission have been reviewed elsewhere (e.g., Wearing et al. 2005) . These models can be very powerful if the biological processes are well defined and demographic and environmental stochasticity are either well-characterized or unimportant for meeting the goal of the research (Hohle et al. 2005 , Britton and Lindenstrand 2009 , He et al. 2010 . However, capturing the stochasticity is especially important when the research goal is to forecast the timing and intensity of disease outbreaks. Recent ''plugand-play'' methods use simulations from flexible classes of compartmental models to generate understanding of complex interactions and stochasticity in dynamic systems (Ionides et al. 2006 , He et al. 2010 ), but currently are applied to understanding direct (human) transmission processes with relatively rich data. Dynamic compartmental modeling may be particularly limited when data are sparse and biological understanding poor, especially when forecasting infectious dynamics of vector-borne and zoonotic disease systems is the goal.",

Advances in remote sensing have greatly increased the amount and scale of data available to characterize environmental variables that can influence the timing and location of disease outbreaks (Kitron et al. 2006) . Observed disease incidence (or host or pathogen abundance) can be readily compared to a suite of variables representing habitat type (Xiao et al. 2007 , Brown et al. 2008 , climate (Brownstein et al. 2003 , Xiao et al. 2007 , and dispersal pathways (Kilpatrick et al. 2006a) . These databased methods can certainly capture the heterogeneity in population abundance and infection dynamics, but may not have enough biological integrity to extend beyond the unique time and place in which data were collected. Phenomenological models tend to rely on the assumption that the abiotic features measured actually determine disease incidence. When the disease is in the process of expanding in range, the abiotic conditions that match its current range might represent only a small subset of those that permit its existence. Thus, the potential for these types of approaches to provide accurate or useful forecasts of disease incidence relies on how well they capture the underlying biological processes that determine transmission rates, which can be difficult to evaluate. Still, phenomenological modeling has undoubtedly provided important insight into the distribution and spread of infectious disease and can be instrumental in defining the broad realm of possible interactions and hypotheses (Kilpatrick et al. 2006a , Xiao et al. 2007 , Peterson and Williams 2008 .",

State-space models, which may also be hierarchically structured, are becoming standard for portraying population dynamics (Tavecchia et al. 2009 , Wang 2009 ), but they have not been widely applied in modeling infectious diseases (Baadsgaard et al. 2004 , He et al. 2010 . The state-space approach to modeling populations can be described as the nesting of two models; an observation equation that relates the observed data to the unobserved but true state of the population, and a process equation that represents understanding of the processes governing the state. The state-space formulation allows for partitioning of uncertainty that arises from our inability to perfectly observe the process (i.e., observation error) and uncertainty that results from the failure of our model to perfectly represent the process (process variance or model misspecification). This is especially important in time series applications where process error propagates over time but observation error does not (Calder et al. 2003 ). If the model is further structured to allow for individual heterogeneity in disease risk (for example) as well as population risk, then it is also hierarchical. Both state-space and hierarchical approaches to data-model assimilation are potentially important avenues for future advances in understanding the infectious dynamics of zoonotic and vector-born infectious disease.",

Human infections with Lyme disease or West Nile virus result when unusual or extreme events that may occur seasonally or sporadically cause critical thresholds to be surpassed (e.g., contact rates, transmission timing, or vector abundance). Our goal is to identify similar characteristics among these diverse pathogen systems that either have facilitated or limited successful data-model integration for inference or forecasting.

Model parameters were estimated from observations of events during the course of the disease, including onset of symptoms, hospitalization, and death or recovery. Assimilation of these data with a modeling framework allowed estimation of epidemiological quantities of interest, in particular, the basic reproductive number, R 0 (Table 1) , and the reproductive number R, the number of infections created by an infected individual in a population containing a mixture of infected and susceptible individuals. The reproductive number is critical to assessing the success of control efforts because it must be ,1 to assure that the epidemic is subsiding. Several data-model assimilation techniques were used to estimate R 0 and R including classical (Lipsitch et al. 2003 ), hierarchical Bayes (McBryde et al. 2006 , Lekone 2008 , and maximum likelihood (Riley et al. 2003, Wang and Ruan 2004) methods. Despite differences in approaches, similar estimates of key parameters were obtained (Table 1) . A critically important result obtained from the parameterized models was the discovery, relatively early in the epidemic, that control efforts would be effective in reversing the exponential increase of new cases (Lipsitch et al. 2003 , Riley et al. 2003 .",

            "text": "There were several lessons from modeling SARS that can be broadly applied to other problems in assimilating data with models of infectious disease. As with any stochastic process, separate realizations of the process, in this case the trajectory of epidemics, differed among locations (Wallinga and Teunis 2004) . Some of these differences can be explained by high levels of heterogeneity in transmission, the phenomenon known as ''super spreading,'' which emerged as a hallmark of the SARS epidemic May 2005, Lloyd-Smith et al. 2005) . Although the average number of infections created by an infected individual was certainly less than 10 (Table 1) , a few, rare individuals infected more than 100 (Riley et al. 2003 , Galvani and May 2005 , Small et al. 2006 ). It appears that hospital environments that failed to isolate infected individuals early in the epidemic caused this heterogeneity: rates of infection in un-isolated hospital environments were an order of magnitude higher than in the non-hospital environment (Kuk and Tan 2009 ). Thus, estimates of infectivity of individuals showed that the three examples of ''super spreading'' actually did not have exceptionally high infectiousness; instead, superspreading events seemed to result from characteristics of the environments where these individuals expressed symptoms (Lloyd-Smith et al. 2005, Kuk and Tan 2009). Heterogeneity in transmission or contact rates must be included as sources of stochasticity in models of disease processes. Failure to do so causes false precision in parameter estimates and in forecasts. Several alternatives for dealing with these heterogeneities in modeldata assimilation have been used in modeling the SARS epidemic. Heterogeneity in transmission may be more accurately captured by increasing the number of states in the model, thereby allowing for differences in transmission parameters for each state. For example Riley et al. (2003) included meta-population structure in their model of the SARS epidemic in Hong Kong. Splitting the infected class into hospitalized and unhospitalized states represents another illustration of this approach (Lipsitch et al. 2003, Wang and Ruan 2004) . A second approach was to employ more realistic models of host contact to better represent heterogeneities resulting from non-uniform mixing of infected and susceptible individuals (e.g., Meyers et al. 2005 , Small et al. 2006 , Zhong et al. 2009 ). Finally, parameters may be defined as temporally varying as the epidemic proceeds, reflecting the heterogeneity in transmission created by public health interventions (Kuk and Tan 2009 ). All of these alternative approaches require expanding the number of parameters to be estimated, which leads to problems with parameter estimation when data are limited (as they inevitably are early in an epidemic). More importantly, all of these strategies for dealing with heterogeneity require sufficient understanding of transmission to represent the heterogeneity in a coherent way within the structure of the model. Rarely will such understanding exist during disease emergence.",

Efforts were made to determine if model results were sensitive to such errors, without formally estimating their magnitude (Lipsitch et al. 2003) . It is well known that there are uncertainties in even the best casereporting data: there are cases that go undiagnosed and those that are misdiagnosed. These errors are most likely to occur early in epidemics, when data are sparse and parameter estimates are most sensitive to errors. This argues that future data-model assimilation could benefit from state-space approaches that formally estimate uncertainty arising from observation error and process variance. The SARS epidemic illustrates both the challenges and the benefits of formally assimilating data with models of emerging infectious disease. Because disease transmission was between humans and because it emerged in nations with relatively well-developed public health programs, data on the progression of SARS were far more extensive than could be expected for many diseases. In other words, the data were about as good as they get for outbreaks of a new disease. Despite the quality of the data, the models that generated inference to understand the epidemic were relatively simple, with few parameters and many simplifying assumptions. This simplicity did not prevent them from being useful, but it does caution excessive optimism for data-model assimilation efforts that involve sparse data and greater inherent uncertainty.",

Although the ancestral transmission cycle of dengue viruses likely included forest primates, human populations are generally believed to be the primary reservoirs for current dengue outbreaks (Gubler 1998) . The predominant vector transmitting dengue to humans is the mosquito Aedes aegypti, a species that lives in close proximity to humans and often breeds in man-made containers. The acute illness manifests as headache, fever, exhaustion, rash, and muscle and joint pains. There are four serotypes of dengue viruses and infection with heterologous serotypes in fairly close temporal proximity may produce more severe disease (dengue shock syndrome and dengue hemorrhagic fever). Although dengue has been endemic in Asia since at least since the 18th century, expansion of the mosquito vectors and global movement of human populations have greatly changed the distribution and intensity of dengue fever, which is now considered an emergent or reemerging disease across Africa, Australia, and the Americas (Gubler 1998) . It is estimated that approximately10 million cases of uncomplicated dengue occur annually, with 500 000 cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever or shock syndrome primarily from tropical and subtropical regions.",

However it is important to note that because humans are the primary dengue host, human behavior may be as important as vector abundance for accurate forecasts of pathogen amplification and disease risk. Models have been useful for understanding dengue transmission and for evaluating control strategies. Dynamic compartmental models for vector-borne diseases affecting humans are generally similar to the SEIR-type mathematical models described above, but with the added complexity of a vector population (MacDonald 1957, Anderson and May 1992) . For instance, Burattini et al. (2008) linked a series of nine differential equations to characterize dengue infection in human hosts and mosquitoes. The authors used this simulation model to evaluate control options and showed that even a dramatic crash in the size of adult mosquito populations may not be sufficient to stop ongoing dengue epidemics (Burattini et al. 2008) .",

For example, climatic conditions are important predictors of dengue amplification due to the tight relationship between mosquito life cycles and temperature and precipitation. Mosquito development from egg to biting adult, survival rate at each life stage, and feeding behavior are all strongly dependent on temperature (Watts et al. 1987 , Rueda et al. 1990 , Focks et al. 1993 . Furthermore, the extrinsic incubation period (EIP) of viral replication within the mosquito depends nonlinearly on temperature and is maximal at temperatures above 348C, while the virus fails to be transmitted at temperatures below 308C (Watts et al. 1987) in the laboratory. Due to the intimate connection between mosquito population dynamics, viral amplification, and climatic variables, much effort has been invested in developing methods to integrate climate data with observations of mosquitoes and dengue incidence. However, while climate data are often available and prolific at broad spatial scales, mosquito data are less abundant and are rarely characterized at the scale of climate data. Local and transient weather patterns and interactions with land cover are likely to control real-time mosquito abundances and can be difficult to ascertain from the available climate data. A formal framework for accommodating mismatches in scale in order to coherently integrate process models, historical disease incidence data, experimental results, and diverse environmental data would greatly advance understanding of the ecological characteristics that control dengue outbreaks, as well as many other vector-borne diseases.",

The authors also included an adaptive cubic spline component to control for the inherent (and potentially confounding) seasonality in weather variables. Johansson et al. (2009) demonstrated that spatial heterogeneity in the shorterterm relationships between weather and dengue transmission might best be understood within the context of spatial patterns in long-term climate characteristics. For example, the cumulative effect of temperature on dengue incidence was greatest in the cooler mountainous areas, while precipitation was most important in the dry southwestern coastal region. Neither temperature nor precipitation was an important predictor of dengue in the region where they were already normally high. The two-stage analysis employed by Johansson et al. (2009) to estimate average global effects and determinants of local variation is an approach that could be applied to a number of other environmentally mediated diseases. This also highlights how simple amalgamation of many studies across space could generate misleading or uninterpretable results.",

In the ensuing 30 years, Lyme disease has spread geographically from a coastal New England focus throughout much of the northeastern and mid-Atlantic regions, and adjacent southeastern Canada.

Borrelia can persist in several wildlife (zoonotic) hosts and amplify whenever conditions allow. Data and understanding of tick biology and the ecological interactions between ticks and their zoonotic hosts are critical to the study of human Lyme disease risk. Humans are not the predominant host in the Lyme disease system (see Fig. 1c ). Humans cannot infect each other or infect ticks. In eastern and central North America, the sole vector of Lyme disease is the blacklegged tick, I. scapularis. Ixodes scapularis ticks feed on vertebrate hosts three times, once each as a larva, nymph, and adult. Larval and nymphal ticks are extreme host generalists that will feed readily from dozens of potential zoonotic host species (Keirans et al. 1996 , LoGiudice et al. 2003 . Ticks that feed from an infected host might acquire an infection, which can persist and be transmitted during the nymphal (if infected as larvae) and adult blood meals. The life cycle of the blacklegged tick typically lasts for two years and includes three blood meals that are often taken from three different host species.",

Ogden et al. (2007) prioritized the importance of tick population dynamics and included a model component to simulate blacklegged tick population change by incorporating rates of survival, development, and host-finding of all life stages, as well as reproduction by adults. The component model for tick population dynamics (Ogden et al. 2005) included 48 different parameters for tick vital rates and two for host availability (white-footed mice and white-tailed deer), and was able to characterize locally observed population fluctuations of larval, nymphal, and adult ticks reasonably well. However, the resultant inference derived from even this complex, ecologically thoughtful model relied heavily on key assumptions. For example, tick population dynamics were most sensitive to mortality rates of immatures (larvae and nymphs), which were assumed to be time-invariant constants. Because of this assumption, warmer conditions that accelerate development automatically resulted in higher densities simply because ticks spent less time subject to constant daily probability of mortality (Ogden et al. 2005) . These models thus predict northward expansion of blacklegged ticks into Canada as a consequence of anthropogenic climate change. However, they are unable to accommodate nonlinear or spatially heterogeneous relationships between climatic conditions and tick demography. For instance, a warmer winter climate could plausibly promote tick survival and population growth in northern latitudes while simultaneously reducing survival and population growth in southern latitudes. As seen in both the previous case study examples, heterogeneity in transmission rates in both space and time is a fundamental determinant of pathogen amplification and transmission that is often overlooked in even the most mechanistically complex modeling approaches.",

            "text": "Phenomenological models have been constructed to examine the spatial and temporal distribution of blacklegged ticks based on abiotic variables that can be remotely sensed. In general, these approaches use presence/absence type data for blacklegged ticks at one location to construct current distribution maps in order to delineate areas with ticks from those without ticks (Estrada-Pena 2002 , Brownstein et al. 2003 , 2005 . Many of these models can capture current tick distribution with high sensitivity and specificity and are often used to predict the spread of Lyme disease risk into all abiotically suitable tick habitats that occur outside the current range. For a pathogen that is in the process of expanding in range (as is Borrelia), the abiotic conditions that match its current range might represent only a small subset of those that permit its existence. When this is true, any given snapshot of these conditions will be highly conservative in predicting the future range. Phenomenological models often fail to meaningfully address biological mechanisms that might affect tick populations and Lyme disease risk. The abiotic variables that enter models are selected not from a priori expectations but from the set of available data that can be produced from remote sensors. Even when high sensitivity and specificity can be achieved, the predictor variables are often biologically uninterpretable and not necessarily sufficient for accurate forecasting. A complex, fourth-order polynomial with minimum winter temperature was found to be the best predictor of habitat suitability for blacklegged ticks in Brownstein et al. (2003) . Such modeled relationships can be highly informative for generating and defining the hypotheses regarding the complex ecological interactions and mechanisms driving spatiotemporal intensity of Lyme disease, but they are not always sufficient for evaluating those hypotheses or for generating accurate forecasts.",

There now exists a large library of related experiments and field observation studies that together generate strong inference (e.g., Plowright et al. 2008 ) regarding the complex ecological interactions that lead to spatiotemporal variability in Lyme disease (e.g., Schmidt and Ostfeld 2001 , Schauber et al. 2005 , Ostfeld et al. 2006 . Synthesis of data sources from a broad group of researchers has shown that the timing and composition of host community dynamics are critical components of Lyme disease amplification and are best understood within the hosts' broader trophic interactions (Fig. 2) . The diverse expertise and field data required to define and understand the relationships in Fig. 2 are clearly only possible through collaborative efforts and careful data-model assimilation. Whitefooted mice are the most competent reservoir for Borrelia burgdorferi and also the host on which the tick vector is most likely to survive while attempting a blood meal (Keesing et al., 2009) . Consequently, high abundance of white-footed mice in midsummer when larval ticks are most active results in ample opportunities for blood meals that are likely to both infect larval ticks and promote survival to the nymphal stage. The population density of nymphs and infection prevalence with B. burgdorferi are correlated with population density of white-footed mice in the previous summer (Ostfeld et al. , 2006 . Summer population density of white-footed mice, in turn, is determined largely by acorn production (genus Quercus) the prior autumn (Elkinton et al. 1996 , Ostfeld et al. 1996 , Jones et al. 1998 . Mouse populations with access to abundant seed resources have high overwinter survival rates, begin breeding earlier in the spring, and reach higher densities at the time ticks are seeking hosts (Wolff 1996 , Ostfeld et al. 2006 . Because of the strong trophic links between acorns and mice and between mice and both ticks and Borrelia, acorn production provides a valuable leading indicator of incidence of Lyme disease in humans two summers later (Schauber et al. 2005) . Because acorn production by populations of oaks can be synchronized over areas of hundreds to thousands of square kilometers (Liebhold et al. 2004) , the predictive power of acorn production at any one site might be high even hundreds of kilometers away (Schauber et al. 2005) .",

Models that can characterize population fluctuations and infection rates for Ixodes ticks can advance understanding of multiple disease systems. Having detailed understanding of why and when tick populations increase and how this relates to human exposures is fundamental to disease management and forecasting. The Lyme disease system presents a clear example of how ecological understanding can be developed through an approach including both empirical field work and mathematical process models and how this broader understanding can inform local and regional public health protection. This system also illustrates that data are still needed to better understand host and vector abundances and demographic processes, at both fine and broad spatial scales. And finally, a formal framework to assimilate these diverse data with biological process models is required to elucidate the spatial determinants of current risk and to forecast future risk in a changing environment. Models that are supported by the abiotic and relevant biotic (e.g., seed production, host availability) data could be used in combination with land-use change models and regional climate change scenarios to predict specific changes in the distribution of ticks and the pathogens they transmit.",

West Nile virus spread rapidly across North America and since 2002, there have been an average 4089 6 2738 (mean 6 SD) human cases reported and 156 6 89 deaths per year (data available online). 6 Persistence of WNV in the environment requires a continuous bird-mosquito-bird cycle that includes amplification of the virus in both the avian hosts and mosquito vectors. Several species of birds may be competent hosts (i.e., can be infected and reinfect a vector; Komar et al. 2003 ) and a subset of those are susceptible to WNV disease (Komar et al. 2003 . Likewise, there are several mosquito species that may play important roles in amplifying and transmitting the virus between birds and to humans (Andreadis et al. 2004 , Kilpatrick et al. 2005 , Turell et al. 2005 . Humans and other large mammals are not necessary for WNV persistence or amplification; they may be infected with WNV if bitten by an infectious mosquito but do not produce sufficient viremia to reinfect a mosquito. As few as one in roughly 100-200 undiagnosed WNV infections is ever reported (Tonjes 2008) , and although human incidence is a readily available data source, disease risk cannot be effectively understood by evaluation of recorded human incidence alone.",

There is a growing library of research detailing the individual components of the WNV disease system: varying competence (ability to become infected and transmit infection) among mosquito vector species (Kilpatrick et al. 2005 , Turell et al. 2005 , Reisen et al. 2006b ) and avian host species (Komar et al. 2003) , strain-specific relationships between temperature and viral replication rates within mosquitoes (Reisen et al. 2006a , vector feeding preference (Andreadis et al. 2004 , Kilpatrick et al. 2006b , host immunity (Fang and Reisen 2006) , spatial heterogeneity in host seroprevalence (Komar et al. 2005 , Bradley et al. 2008 , and spatiotemporal records of human incidence (see footnote 6).

For example, mosquito density (Tachiiri et al. 2006 ) and early-season vector infection rates (Brownstein et al. 2004 ) both seem to indicate increased human risk of WNV infection in late summer. Evidence of WNV infections in avian communities in early and midsummer are also potential predictors of local spillover of WNV into human populations (Eidson et al. 2001 , Guptill et al. 2003 , Nielsen and Reisen 2007 . As in the earlier case studies, the assumption that vector density is positively associated with human disease risk is widely accepted. Thus, when the early-warning signals mentioned above indicate that WNV amplification is occurring, mosquito control programs are most often enacted to reduce local mosquito abundances (e.g., Carney et al. 2008 , Lothrop et al. 2008 . Experimentation to test the efficacy of these early-warning signals or the importance of the biological processes they represent could potentially leave humans at risk and is not ethically feasible. As is the case with most infectious disease research, more creative methods are needed to synthesize the available data with alternative process models to evaluate mechanistic assumptions that characterize disease transmission and define how human risk is minimized.",

Wonham and colleagues (2006) reviewed several published compartmental models of WNV transmission, all of which used a slightly different structure of differential equations to represent transitions between susceptible and infected hosts and susceptible and infected vectors. The authors found that each model was highly sensitive to the assumptions regarding the relationship between transmission rate and abundances of hosts and vectors (i.e., density dependent, frequency dependent, constant) and that allowing animal hosts to transition from infected to immune (versus to susceptible or dead) dramatically changed the predicted R 0 for the disease (Wonham et al. 2006) . Unfortunately, data on host recovery and immunity is rare (but see Komar et al. 2003 , Fang and Reisen 2006 , Nemeth et al. 2008 and potential heterogeneities among recovery rates for species and regions need to be obtained before reliable predictions of R 0 can be made. Jiang et al. (2009) also used the WNV system to demonstrate that parameter estimates (e.g., of R 0 ) from standard dynamic compartmental models are also sensitive to starting conditions (i.e., the initial numbers of infected birds or mosquitoes).",

From the discussion of SARS, it is clear that public health risk can be effectively managed with minimal understanding of zoonotic reservoirs if the transmission pathway important to human epidemics is maintained by direct humanto-human contact (Fig. 1b) . However, lack of ecological understanding of the zoonotic reservoirs and the variables that allowed for the initial spillover transmission to humans may mean that we have little ability to forecast when and where SARS or similar pathogens may jump to humans in the future. When zoonotic reservoirs and vector species are important for pathogen persistence and amplification in the environment (Fig.  1b and c) , it becomes essential to coherently integrate data on vector and host demography as well as infectious dynamics.",

Each of these components is already well established. They have not, however, all been brought together in the context of zoonotic disease for data integration or epidemic forecasting. The conceptual framework presented in Fig. 3 presents opportunities for pooling information from multiple sources while weighting these in a consistent way based on their information content. Importantly, because the component model parts are assembled together conditionally, adding or removing parts and comparing alternative models can be straightforward (Clark 2005 ). We have constructed a framework that combines the advantages of statistical models (i.e., explicit incorporation of data and quantification of uncertainty) with the key features of more traditional epidemiological models (i.e., incorporating mechanistic insights and exploring system dynamics like thresholds for emergence and persistence). Furthermore, the framework characterized by Fig. 3 explicitly relates ecological disease dynamics in zoonotic hosts and/or vectors to human disease prevalence in a stochastic spatial and temporal context.",

However, zoonotic and vectorborne infectious diseases are complex systems and failure to acknowledge the inherent heterogeneity and uncertainty is a major roadblock to advances in ecological forecasting. We are attempting to lay out a general structure that can accommodate the key modeling goals and lessons from the case studies, while providing a context for classifying and comparing models that implement different components of this idealized general model. While the overall conceptual framework is complex, it is built by combining tools that already exist in epidemiology, ecology, and statistics. In just the past decade great strides have been made that address each of the disease modeling goals discussed above. There have been methodological advances in spatiotemporal modeling (Neubert and Caswell 2000, Banerjee et al. 2004) , disease mapping (Biggeri et al. 2006 , Jin et al. 2007 ), dynamic spread models (Hooten and Wikle 2008) , integrating data into dynamic models (Clark and Bjornstad 2004 , Hobbs and Hilborn 2006 , He et al. 2010 , and in developing flexible ''data models'' to accommodate error structures and bias in observations (Congdon 2003 , Ogle and Barber 2008 ). Model choice and validation for complex, hierarchical models remains a topic of current statistical research and we will not address it in detail here. However, in addition to recommending the ''strong inference'' approaches (e.g., Plowright et al. 2008) , we stress that model structure, assumptions, and data support should be evaluated carefully at each stage. Specific model selection and choice methodologies will depend on the model structure and the research goals (Clark et al. 2007 , Craigmile et al. 2009 , He et al. 2010 .",

Each data type can contribute toward understanding and predicting the FIG. 3. A conceptual framework for inference and forecasting vector-borne zoonotic disease. (a) Modeling zoonotic/ecological components requires data models (shaded boxes, dashed lines) to relate observations to ''true'' latent variables and process models, shown in solid lines and unfilled boxes. Relevant data sources include environmental data layers (e.g., temperature, precipitation, habitat measures), and observations of host and vector abundances (counts), as well as observed infection rates. (b) An additional component model can be used to link processes (and uncertainties) in panel (a), to refine inference and forecasting of human disease risk. Data sources include observed human incidence and the data layers that describe bias in human case reporting (e.g., socioeconomic) or alter transmission and infection dynamics (e.g., recreational activities, immunosuppression). latent parameters critical to disease dynamics, but each is also subject to potentially large measurement error. One of the major advantages to using a conditional hierarchical modeling approach is the ability to flexibly accommodate such data types and their different sources of measurement error by explicitly characterizing the relationship between each type of data and the latent parameters they inform (dashed arrows in Fig. 3) . Examples of such data models include likelihood-based mark-recapture models, which have been extended to incorporate among-individual and spatial and temporal variation (Royle and Link 2002, Royle 2009 ), and error rate models for infection assays (Joseph et al. 1995) . Incidence data on human disease are also subject to error (e.g., He et al. 2010) . Lyme disease reports, for example, may be low in areas with recent disease emergence and rise as physician awareness increases (Young 1998 , Chen et al. 2006 . The framework in Fig. 3 allows for such biases to be systematically dealt with; observed disease can be related to true incidence through a data model with a spatially and temporally varying latent parameter to characterize the probability that a case is reported given that it actually occurred. Furthermore, these probability parameters could be regressed on factors identified as important in previous studies, such as time since first disease report in the county, distance from a hospital, and human population density, potentially allowing us to also learn about the sources of reporting error and bias.",

However, a key difference is that the process models in Fig. 3 are both formally fused with data and structured to allow for parameter stochasticity. For example, in a vector-borne disease system we could use a susceptible-infected (SI) model to characterize pathogen movement through susceptible uninfected and infected vectors, and relate the infection process to surveys of vector abundance and infection. The SI model would include a stochastic and potentially spatially and temporally varying transmission parameter, and be implemented as a state-space model in which populations of susceptible and infected vectors are related through data error models to the raw survey data. A more detailed model could then add population structure and could also include an analogous model for primary reservoir hosts. When these process models capture key dynamics of the disease's epidemiology, they will allow us to explore thresholds for disease persistence in a population and test how close to such thresholds real populations tend to be. In Lyme disease, for example, rate of infection of the tick vector appears to be correlated well with local tick abundance (Chen et al. 2006 ). This makes sense mechanistically: in a standard SI model, higher tick abundance means more bites per host, (assuming constant host density), which increases the proportion of infected hosts because each host is ''sampling'' multiple ticks and has a greater chance of encountering an infected one. Higher host infection rates will feed back to increase the rates of infection in ticks, because there will be a higher probability that each tick's blood meal comes from an infected host (Caraco et al. 2002) . So the proportion of infected ticks and tick abundance are dynamically related both directly and through feedbacks, and their nonlinear covariation will inform the process model for infection dynamics to provide inference about the critical latent variables of transmission and amplification rates. As with current dynamic compartment models, the precision and accuracy of the parameters will be directly related to the biological assumptions that structure the model and to the data used to construct the model. However, the structure of this framework will allow us to evaluate data and process structure explicitly through the partitioned process and observation error terms.",

As with many data models, spatially varying parameter models have been extensively studied in the statistics field, but applying them to zoonotic and vector-borne disease and in combination with other hierarchical levels is novel and could make these models more useful for managing and forecasting disease.",

In the conceptual framework we are proposing, the relative risk of human disease occurrence is represented by a latent intensity surface that varies as a function of a few key parameters from the process models characterizing infection in vector and host populations. This disease intensity surface can be then related to hypothesized causal factors such as density and infection rates of vectors, and with environmental factors, including climate and land use, as well as population and behavior data, including contact networks (Farnsworth et al. 2006 ). For spatially aggregated or areal unit data (e.g., county-level disease counts) standard spatial modeling tools include conditional autoregressive (CAR) models that allow correlation among areas defined as ''neighboring'' (Banerjee et al. 2004) . By testing alternative model structures informed by existing information, we should be able to use the proposed framework to identify key links between population processes (the disease organism, the vector, the animal hosts), extrinsic environmental factors (land use, climate), and human infections. The spatial flexibility of the models, to the extent sufficient data are available to support this, will be useful for exploring variation in these relationships in space and time, and for distinguishing relationships that are relatively constant from others that change with environmental gradients or population characteristics. Using models in this exploratory way brings us back around to where epidemiology began with John Snow and the water pump, now with better tools but faced with the harder challenge of finding the key sources and drivers of infection for complex emerging diseases.",

Better understanding of the population dynamics of common host and vector species for pathogens already present in North America (i.e., birds, mice, mosquitoes, ticks) is vital to managing these diseases but may also be important for limiting EIDs still to come. We echo many other researchers in our call for support of long term monitoring and interdisciplinary collaboration (e.g., Crowl et al. 2008) . Public health departments, veterinarians, ecologists and epidemiologists all gather distinctive information that should be integrated (with input from statisticians, mathematicians, and computer scientists) in a model framework like the one proposed here, to produce better mechanistic insights and, eventually, better forecasts.
