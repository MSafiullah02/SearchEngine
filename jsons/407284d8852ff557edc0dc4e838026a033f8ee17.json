Appreciation of pulmonary pathology in the medicolegal context is important as it frequently contributes to the immediate or underlying mechanisms of death. The primacy of the lungs in breathing and their coordinated function with the cardiovascular system means that pulmonary failure can rapidly compromise tissue oxygenation and body chemistry, leading to an alteration in blood pH, hypoxic damage to downstream tissues and ultimately multiorgan failure and death. Moreover, given that the lungs have direct contact with the environment through inhalation and receive approximately 50% of the cardiac output with each beat of the heart, they may be adversely affected by hazardous agents from the outside world or other pathologic processes not primarily located in the lungs. The range of topics discussed herein is limited by design to deaths due to disease and largely foregoes discussion of more forensically relevant issues relating to toxicology or trauma. Furthermore, the content and format of this chapter is not intended to be encyclopedic, but rather attempts to highlight selected issues regarding pulmonary disease of potential relevance to surgical or forensic pathologists who perform medicolegal postmortem examinations.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "is dependent not only on the reduction in size and volume of the lung, but also on the stage of development of the pulmonary parenchyma.

Classically, the flotation or hydrostatic test is utilized, which is based on the premise that en bloc lungs or an individual lung placed in water will float if aerated, suggesting that the neonate had at some point breathed or sink if nonaerated, signifying that the fetus was stillborn [4] . Interpretation of the results of this is fraught with difficulty in and it is not recommended to be used in isolation to make a determination of live birth. Potential causes for false-positive results could include air trapping due to attempted resuscitation or the production of postmortem gases by bacteria during putrefactive decomposition. Gas-producing bacteria may be introduced into the airways, for example, through postdelivery contamination when delivered into a toilet or as a consequence of choramnionitis. Furthermore, we have encountered the circumstance where lungs were examined separately and revealed that one lung sank and the other floated. Moreover, interpreting an increase in the lung's mass as evidence of perimortem breathing, thought to be due to expansion and vascular perfusion of the parenchyma, is also a poor indicator of live birth [4] . Histological sections of the lung may show evidence of alveoli expanded by air following a live birth.

One of the most common causes for sudden and unexpected death is acute, occlusive pulmonary arterial thromboembolism. The origin of intravascular thrombi is typically from deep femoral, popliteal, or crural veins. Sometimes thromboemboli originate from deep pelvic veins, the inferior caval vein, hepatic veins, deep veins of the upper extremities or mural thrombi from within the heart. The cause of deep venous thrombi may be a consequence of an identifiable thrombogenic risk factor(s) ( Table 3 .7). Acute thromboemboli may cause sudden death through occlusion of one or more large caliber pulmonary arteries. In addition, diffuse occlusion of smaller caliber vessels by thromboemboli, located in the more peripheral zones of the lung may also cause sudden death. The number and/or size of acute thrombi that cause sudden death likely depend on the underlying cardiopulmonary reserve of the affected individual. Any combination of proximal and/or peripherally located thromboemboli that cause an acute rise in the right ventricular systolic pressure by 40-50 mmHg can lead to acute heart failure [19] . Moreover, one may consider microscopically dating intravascular thrombi into, for example, recent, organizing, organized, or old thrombi in order to provide comment about the potential chronicity of the embolic process, which could have medicolegal significance. For example, if an individual dies 4 days following a surgical procedure of pulmonary thromboembolism, yet has evidence of organizing and organized thrombi in their pulmonary arteries and deep veins of their lower legs, one may at least suggest that the decedent had underlying thrombogenic risk factors that preceded the surgical procedure.
