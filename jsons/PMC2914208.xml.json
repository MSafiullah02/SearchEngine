These viruses target a variety of tissues and generally cause mild disease. In humans, coronaviruses are responsible for approximately 20% of common cold cases (Larson et al., 1980). However, in 2002, a novel human coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), emerged in the Guangdong Province of China (Kuiken et al., 2003, Rota et al., 2003). SARS-CoV is unlike any other human coronavirus to date, causing severe respiratory disease and death in 10% of infected patients (WHO, 2003).",

            "text": "While many enveloped viruses assemble at the plasma membrane, coronaviruses assemble intracellularly and bud into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) (Klumperman et al., 1994). To produce infectious virus, the envelope proteins must be targeted to the ERGIC for virus assembly. Many coronavirus envelope proteins localize near the assembly site when exogenously expressed alone (Corse & Machamer, 2000, Klumperman et al., 1994); however, others rely on lateral interactions with other envelope proteins to localize to the virus assembly site (McBride et al., 2007, Nguyen & Hogue, 1997, Opstelten et al., 1995). Like other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV encodes 3 envelope proteins, spike (S), envelope (E) and membrane (M) (Marra et al., 2003, Rota et al., 2003). The S protein is the second most abundant protein in the virion envelope. It is a type-I membrane protein that determines host cell tropism and is responsible for virus\u2013cell as well as cell\u2013cell fusion (Cavanagh, 1995, Gallagher & Buchmeier, 2001). The SARS-CoV S glycoprotein is large (approximately 180 kDa) and heavily glycosylated with 23 potential N-linked glycosylation sites (Marra et al., 2003, Rota et al., 2003). The cytoplasmic tail of the SARS-CoV S is palmitoylated (Petit et al., 2007) and contains a weak endoplasmic reticulum retrieval signal that helps it localize to the virus assembly site when co-expressed with SARS-CoV M (McBride et al., 2007). The M protein is the most abundant protein in the virion envelope. M can form homo-oligomers and acts as a scaffold for virus assembly, interacting with S, E and the viral nucleocapsid (de Haan et al., 2000, Hogue & Machamer, 2008). SARS-CoV M has an N-linked glycosylation site, three transmembrane domains and a long cytoplasmic tail (Voss et al., 2006). The E protein is the least abundant protein in the virion envelope although it has an important role in virion budding and release (DeDiego et al., 2007, Fischer et al., 1998, Kuo & Masters, 2003, Machamer & Youn, 2006, Ortego et al., 2007, Ortego et al., 2002). Although the topology and glycosylation of SARS-CoV E is controversial, it has a single hydrophobic domain and is palmitoylated on its cytoplasmic tail (reviewed in (Liu et al., 2007).",

Protein palmitoylation occurs by the addition of the fatty acid palmitate to a protein via a thioester linkage (Resh, 2006a). Protein palmitoylation can greatly increase the hydrophobicity of a protein, which can in turn affect protein activity. Transmembrane proteins are commonly palmitoylated on cysteine residues that are at or near the lipid bilayer (Resh, 2006a). Cytoplasmic proteins can also be palmitoylated, inducing membrane association (Greaves and Chamberlain, 2007). Palmitoylation is generally reversible and can be highly dynamic (Linder and Deschenes, 2007). Addition of palmitate to proteins can greatly influence a protein's trafficking, stability, localization and interaction with other proteins (Delandre et al., 2009, McCormick et al., 2008, Van Itallie et al., 2005). Because of the great versatility of protein palmitoylation, it can be used to dynamically regulate protein function (Baker et al., 2003, Iwanaga et al., 2009).",

Coronavirus S protein palmitoylation appears to be important for cell\u2013cell fusion (Petit et al., 2007), infectivity and virus assembly (Thorp et al., 2006). In addition, for mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), it has been shown that S protein palmitoylation is important for interaction with the M protein (Thorp et al., 2006). Coronavirus E protein palmitoylation is important for E protein stability, virus assembly and production (Boscarino et al., 2008, Lopez et al., 2008). Although many important roles for palmitoylation of coronavirus envelope proteins have been suggested, few studies have analyzed all of the possible palmitoylated cysteine residues with regard to function (Petit et al., 2007). Pharmacological inhibition of palmitoylation is commonly used (Thorp et al., 2006), although this has deleterious effects on general cellular functions since palmitoylation is a common modification (Mikic et al., 2006, Resh, 2006b).",

We confirm previous reports that suggest a role for SARS-CoV S protein palmitoylation in cell\u2013cell fusion and also provide evidence for the importance of palmitoylation in SARS-CoV S partitioning into detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs). Importantly, we show that SARS-CoV S palmitoylation is not necessary for efficient interaction with SARS-CoV M, which differs from published experiments for MHV (Thorp et al., 2006) and suggests a significant difference between the two viruses that may have important implications for virus assembly and infectivity.",

Since the protein acyltransferases responsible for protein palmitoylation are localized throughout the entire secretory pathway (Tsutsumi et al., 2008), it is possible that coronavirus spike proteins could be palmitoylated at the ER, Golgi or the plasma membrane. After glycoproteins are synthesized, their sugars become modified as the protein traffics through the secretory pathway. In the medial Golgi, glycoproteins become resistant to digestion with endoglycosidase H (endo H) (Herscovics, 1999). To determine if SARS-CoV S becomes palmitoylated in a pre-medial Golgi compartment, HEK293T cells exogenously expressing SARS-CoV S were labeled for 30 min with 35S-methionine/cysteine to measure total protein expression or 3H-palmitic acid to measure palmitoylated protein. While 35S-methionine/cysteine labels newly translated proteins, 3H-palmitic acid labels both newly made and pre-existing proteins. After radiolabeled cells were lysed, S protein was immunoprecipitated, denatured and digested with endo H. As expected, upon endo H treatment, there was a population of newly made 35S-labeled S protein that had not yet trafficked past the medial Golgi and was thus sensitive to endo H digestion (Fig. 1A, left). There was also a population of 3H-palmitic acid labeled S protein that was sensitive to digestion with endo H (Fig. 1A, right), indicating that S can be palmitoylated before it traffics through the Golgi en route to the plasma membrane. This result suggests that at least a portion of SARS-CoV S is palmitoylated in a pre-medial Golgi compartment but does not rule out the possibility of additional palmitoylation in a post-medial Golgi compartment.",

HEK293T cells expressing SARS-CoV S or SPN were pulse labeled and chased for various times. Wild-type and mutant S proteins were immunoprecipitated and analyzed. The percentage of protein remaining relative to the zero chase time was calculated for each time of chase. Both SARS-CoV S and SPN had similar half-lives of approximately 2.75 h (Fig. 3\n).

Transmembrane protein trafficking as well as soluble protein translocation to membranes can both be regulated by protein palmitoylation (Resh, 2006a). In fact, palmitoylation of different cysteines on the same protein can lead to dramatic differences in subcellular localization (Roy et al., 2005). To determine if palmitoylation alters the subcellular localization of SARS-CoV S, we performed indirect immunofluorescence microscopy on HEK293T cells expressing SARS-CoV S or SPN. HEK293T cells expressing S or SPN were fixed, permeabilized and co-stained with antibodies to SARS-CoV S and golgin-160 (a Golgi marker). SARS-CoV S and SPN were both present throughout the secretory pathway, with staining at the cell surface and some internal concentration at the Golgi complex co-localizing with golgin-160 (Fig. 4A). To further assess the localization of SARS-CoV S and SPN at the plasma membrane, we performed surface staining on non-permeabilized cells with mouse anti-SARS-CoV S. Subsequently, cells were washed, fixed, permeabilized and then stained for total S protein with rabbit anti-SARS-CoV S. Surface staining of intact cells revealed that SARS-CoV S and SARS-CoV SPN were both present at the plasma membrane (Fig. 4B). These results suggest that blocking palmitoylation does not affect the subcellular localization of SARS-CoV S when exogenously expressed.",

Palmitoylation has been shown to regulate protein\u2013protein interactions (Shmueli et al., 2010). Using the palmitoylation inhibitor 2-bromopalmitate (2-BP) (Thorp et al., 2006) or truncation analysis (Bosch et al., 2005), it has been indirectly shown that palmitoylation of MHV S protein is necessary for interaction with MHV M. When the SARS-CoV S protein is exogenously expressed alone, it localizes to the cell surface. However, when co-expressed with SARS-CoV M, SARS-CoV S localizes to the Golgi complex, co-localizing with M (McBride et al., 2007). To determine if SARS-CoV S palmitoylation is necessary for interaction with M, we performed indirect immunofluorescence microscopy. HEK293T cells exogenously co-expressing SARS-CoV M and SARS-CoV S or SPN were fixed, permeabilized and co-stained with antibodies to SARS-CoV S and SARS-CoV M. Upon co-expression with SARS-CoV M, S was retained intracellularly at the Golgi complex and co-localized completely with M (Fig. 5A). Surprisingly, SARS-CoV SPN was also retained intracellularly at the Golgi when co-expressed with SARS-CoV M (Fig. 5A).",

HEK293T cells expressing SARS-CoV S or SPN in the absence or presence of SARS-CoV M were pulse labeled with 35S-methionine/cysteine and chased for various times. S protein was immunoprecipitated, denatured and digested with endo H. S and SPN had similar trafficking kinetics through the secretory pathway. After 40 min of chase, 70\u201380% of both SARS-CoV S and SPN were resistant to digestion with endo H, implying that 70\u201380% of the pulse-labeled protein had moved past the medial Golgi, presumably en route to the plasma membrane (Fig. 5B). Interestingly, when co-expressed with SARS-CoV M, carbohydrate processing of both S and SPN was dramatically reduced and only 10\u201320% of the labeled protein was resistant to endo H digestion after 40 min of chase (Fig. 5B). Thus, both SARS-CoV S and SPN interacted with M and were retained in a pre-medial Golgi compartment, which is consistent with the previously published cis-Golgi localization of some coronavirus M proteins (Swift and Machamer, 1991).",

            "text": "One of the best known functions of protein palmitoylation is directing incorporation into specific membrane domains that are resistant to extraction with cold Triton X-100. Detergent-resistant membranes (DRMs) are sometimes referred to as lipid rafts and are regions of membrane that are enriched in cholesterol and glycosphingolipids (Brown, 2006). DRMs may represent important signaling centers at the plasma membrane although they can also be found earlier in the secretory pathway at the Golgi (Simons and van Meer, 1988). MHV S is enriched in DRMs and enrichment was reduced by treating cells with 2-BP prior to isolation (Thorp et al., 2006). To determine if SARS-CoV S partitions into DRMs and if that partitioning is dependent on S protein palmitoylation, we isolated DRMs by floatation on a sucrose step gradient after cold Triton X-100 extraction. Fractions were collected and 10% of each fraction was analyzed by SDS\u2013PAGE and Western blotting with antibodies to SARS-CoV S. To identify which fractions contained DRMs, a small portion of each fraction was spotted onto nitrocellulose and incubated with HRP-cholera toxin B which binds to GM1, a glycolipid enriched in DRMs (Brown, 2006). GM1 was primarily present in fraction 4 for both samples (Fig. 6\n, bottom panel). SARS-CoV S was also present in fraction 4 (Fig. 6 top panel) while SPN was completely absent from fractions that contained DRMs (Fig. 6 middle panel). Amido Black staining of the membrane ensured that similar amounts of total protein were present in each lane for both S and SPN (data not shown). It is important to note that the upper fully glycosylated mature form of SARS-CoV S was enriched in DRMs while the immature partially processed form of SARS-CoV S was present in the more dense fractions. These results demonstrate that SARS-CoV S palmitoylation is necessary for S partitioning into DRMs. Approximately 8% of total S protein is at the plasma membrane at steady state by biotinylation (Fig. 4C), and an average of 15% of total S is present in detergent-resistant membranes at steady state. Thus, it is likely that all S at the plasma membrane is present in DRMs.",

However, these studies have either used global palmitoylation inhibitors like 2-BP, which can be toxic to cells (Mikic et al., 2006), or only partial mutagenesis of palmitoylated cysteines. To determine a role for SARS-CoV S cytoplasmic cysteine residues in cell\u2013cell fusion, we compared the fusion activities of SARS-CoV S and SPN in Vero cells, which express the functional SARS-CoV receptor, ACE2. Vero cells expressing SARS-CoV S or SPN were briefly trypsinized to activate the protein for fusion (Simmons et al., 2004). The number of nuclei per syncytia (\u2265 3 nuclei) was counted 24 h after trypsinization. Vero cells expressing SARS-CoV S had extensive syncytium formation with approximately 5 nuclei per syncytia, but syncytium formation was absent in cells expressing SARS-CoV SPN (Fig. 7\n). These results suggest a critical role for S protein palmitoylation in cell\u2013cell fusion.",

However, SARS-CoV S palmitoylation is important for partitioning into DRMs and for cell\u2013cell fusion. Most importantly, SARS-CoV S palmitoylation is not important for interaction with SARS-CoV M. SARS-CoV M retained non-palmitoylated S in the Golgi and reduced the extent of non-palmitoylated S trafficking through the secretory pathway as well as wild-type SARS-CoV S. These results demonstrate a significant difference between SARS-CoV and MHV that may have significant implications for virus assembly and infection.",

Palmitoylation can be dynamic and plays an important role in regulating protein function and activity. In fact, alterations in protein palmitoylation have been shown to affect protein stability, trafficking and subcellular localization as well as protein\u2013protein interactions (Linder & Deschenes, 2007, Lopez et al., 2008, Resh, 2006a, Roy et al., 2005, Thorp et al., 2006, Van Itallie et al., 2005). Transmembrane proteins can be palmitoylated throughout the secretory pathway and cytoplasmic proteins can be palmitoylated at different secretory pathway membranes. Additionally, many important regulatory proteins, signaling molecules and trafficking components have been shown to be palmitoylated (Linder and Deschenes, 2007). In line with the important role of palmitoylation in cellular processes, global inhibition of palmitoylation has deleterious effects on cellular function (Mikic et al., 2006, Resh, 2006b).",

E proteins have 2\u20133 potentially palmitoylated cytoplasmic cysteine residues. The work performed to determine the role of coronavirus E protein palmitoylation used mutagenesis of all potentially palmitoylated cysteine residues, which conclusively implicated or eliminated possible roles for E protein palmitoylation. Coronavirus S proteins contain a cysteine-rich domain in their cytoplasmic tails with at least 7 cysteine residues (Hogue and Machamer, 2008). Coronavirus S protein palmitoylation has been implicated in cell\u2013cell fusion, virus\u2013cell fusion, virus assembly and infectivity; however, studies focusing on the role of S protein palmitoylation have so far mutated only some of the palmitoylated cysteines (Petit et al., 2007, Shulla & Gallagher, 2009) or used pharmacological inhibitors of protein palmitoylation (Thorp et al., 2006). These methods and results led to only a partial disruption of protein palmitoylation and partial phenotypes. Here, we mutated all 9 cytoplasmic cysteine residues to conclusively determine the role of SARS-CoV S palmitoylation.",

            "text": "We constructed a palmitoylation-null mutant protein, SARS-CoV SPN, with all 9 cytoplasmic cysteine residues mutated to alanines, which was not palmitoylated (Fig. 2). The compartment in which envelope proteins become palmitoylated has not been determined for any coronavirus. When SARS-CoV S was exogenously expressed in cells, we identified a population of palmitoylated, endo H sensitive SARS-CoV S (Fig. 1A). This suggests that at least some SARS-CoV S protein is palmitoylated in a pre-medial Golgi compartment. MHV S can also be palmitoylated in an early compartment (van Berlo et al., 1987). However, it will be important to determine if S protein palmitoylation occurs similarly during an infection when other viral proteins are present. Also, we determined that palmitoylation of SARS-CoV S is a relatively stable post-translational modification (Fig. 1B), which appears to be common among palmitoylated viral proteins (Linder and Deschenes, 2007). This does not rule out the possibility that different cysteines may have differential rates of palmitate turnover; however, it does suggest that there is always a population of S protein that is palmitoylated to some extent. Unlike the MHV E protein, disruption of SARS-CoV S palmitoylation did not affect the stability of the protein since SARS-CoV S and SPN had similar half-lives when expressed exogenously (Fig. 3). However, like the E protein, SARS-CoV S palmitoylation does not appear to be important for subcellular localization (Fig. 4) (Boscarino et al., 2008, Corse & Machamer, 2002, Linder & Deschenes, 2007, Lopez et al., 2008). We confirmed previous results published for MHV and SARS-CoV that S palmitoylation is important for cell\u2013cell fusion. However, we show a complete inhibition of cell\u2013cell fusion (not a partial reduction) when cells expressed SPN (Fig. 7). This abolition of cell\u2013cell fusion was not due to a reduction in the amount of SARS-CoV SPN at the plasma membrane (Fig. 4C) but possibly due to an exclusion of SARS-CoV SPN from DRMs (Fig. 6). In fact, DRMs have been implicated in cell\u2013cell fusion events at the plasma membrane (Mukai et al., 2009, Teissier & Pecheur, 2007). Although it is possible that mutating all 9 cysteine residues to alanines dramatically disrupted the conformation of the SARS-CoV S protein, this seems unlikely since SPN was stable, trafficked through the secretory pathway properly (Fig. 5B), had the correct subcellular localization and could still interact with the M protein (Fig. 5A).",

            "text": "Most importantly, we show that palmitoylation of SARS-CoV S is not necessary for interaction with the M protein. Previous results from our lab suggested SARS-CoV S and M could interact in vitro using a recombinant SARS-CoV S cytoplasmic tail purified from bacteria. This recombinant S protein was not palmitoylated, yet it was able to interact with in vitro transcribed and translated SARS-CoV M (McBride et al., 2007). In that in vitro experiment, only the tail of the SARS-CoV S protein was used; here we confirm those results using different in vivo assays using the full length protein. We showed that SARS-CoV M was able to retain SPN at the Golgi complex similarly to wild-type S (Fig. 5A). Also, SARS-CoV M was able to reduce the amount of SPN carbohydrate processing (Fig. 5B) and the amount of SPN at the plasma membrane (data not shown) similar to wild-type SARS-CoV S. These results suggest a significant difference between MHV and SARS-CoV. For MHV, very low concentrations of 2-BP, which only slightly reduced the amount of MHV S palmitoylation, had dramatic results on the ability of MHV S to form a complex with M. This resulted in reduced MHV S incorporation into virions, which led to a reduction in infectious virus (Thorp et al., 2006). MHV S appears to be extremely sensitive to changes in palmitoylation levels, where as SARS-CoV S can better tolerate disruptions in palmitoylation. An interesting possibility is that wild-type fully palmitoylated S and palmitoylation-null S both interact equally well with M, but only partially palmitoylated S protein does not interact efficiently with M protein. It is also possible that an endogenous protein was sensitive to low concentrations of 2-BP in the studies using MHV; this could have subsequently affected MHV S trafficking, localization and/or stability since none of these variables were tested after 2-BP treatment. We attempted to use virus-like particle (VLP) production to determine if SARS-CoV S palmitoylation was important for virus assembly, but the ability of S and SPN to be released from membranous vesicles when expressed alone in 293T cells precluded our ability to determine the contribution of palmitoylation to assembly using this assay. Our results suggest that there would be no difference between S and SPN assembly into virions since both can interact equally well with M; however, it is possible that spike incorporation into virions could depend on more than interaction with M protein. Even if SARS-CoV SPN is well incorporated into assembling virions, overall infection may be limited by the cell\u2013cell fusion defect seen with SPN. Also, recently published work suggests an unexpected role for MHV S cytoplasmic cysteine residues in virus\u2013cell fusion (Shulla and Gallagher, 2009). Here we examined the ability of palmitoylation-null SARS-CoV S to interact with M without complications from virus infection; however, it will also be important to determine the role of S protein palmitoylation in infected cells by inserting the mutations into an infectious clone.",

Identifying palmitoylated SARS-CoV S cysteine residues will prove to be difficult due to the 9 potentially palmitoylated cysteines; a large number of combinatorial cysteine mutations would have to be made to fully uncover the role of each.

            "text": "Although S and SPN are both present at the plasma membrane in similar amounts, SPN is excluded from DRMs. While this is interesting, a more important observation revolves around the amount of SARS-CoV S at the cell surface. Based on our calculations, only 7\u20138% of SARS-CoV S protein expressed in cells is present at the plasma membrane at steady state; however, 15% of total S is present in DRMs. This suggests that all S present at the plasma membrane is in DRMs. Since DRMs form in the late Golgi, it is likely that S is enriched in these domains before trafficking to the plasma membrane. It seems that coronaviruses have evolved multiple mechanisms to control the amount and distribution of S at the plasma membrane. These mechanisms include ER retrieval (Lontok et al., 2004, McBride et al., 2007), endocytosis (Lontok et al., 2004, Petit et al., 2005, Youn et al., 2005), lateral protein\u2013protein interactions (McBride et al., 2007, Opstelten et al., 1995) and sequestration in DRMs (Thorp et al., 2006). It is possible that too much S at the cell surface may compromise a productive infection. In support of this idea, previous work in our lab where the ER retrieval and endocytosis signals of the infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) S protein were mutated in an infectious clone showed massive syncytia formation early after transfection but failed to generate any infectious virus (Youn et al., 2005). This suggests that too much S at the plasma membrane is detrimental to infection, possibly due to premature cell death. Anchoring in DRMs insures that any S that is present at the plasma membrane is functional and fully fusion competent. Thus, only small amounts of S protein at the cell surface are required to ensure efficient cell\u2013cell fusion. It is also possible that MHV relies heavily on S protein palmitoylation for interaction with M because MHV S does not contain an ER retrieval signal. The SARS-CoV S ER retrieval signal presumably increases the possibility of S-M interaction by promoting cycling of S through the budding compartment. Without this mechanism, MHV may rely on palmitoylation to present the S protein cytoplasmic tail properly for interaction with M. It will be interesting to determine the role of IBV S palmitoylation in S-M interaction since IBV S contains a canonical ER retrieval signal.",

Additionally, we conclude that SARS-CoV S palmitoylation is not necessary for efficient interaction with M protein, which is different from previously published results for MHV (Thorp et al., 2006). This suggests there are differences in the requirements for coronavirus assembly that could translate into important differences in virus infection and spread.",
