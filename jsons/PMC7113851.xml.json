In technical analogy to an approach that has been validated for the RNA virus family Picornaviridae (Lauber and Gorbalenya, 2012b), amino acid identity below 90% was found to be discriminatory for the designation of novel CoV species (de Groot et al., 2012). A different criterion, relying on RdRp-grouping units (RGU), also used pairwise amino acid distances, but was restricted to a translated 816 nucleotide RdRp (nsp12) fragment. This was chosen as an amenable approach to account for the partial genomic sequences generated by most PCR-based field studies. It was found that defined alphacoronavirus RGU differed by at least 4.8% and betacoronavirus RGU by at least 6.3% in this RdRp fragment. This allowed a surrogate criterion for species definition in the absence of complete genomic sequences (Drexler et al., 2010, Tao et al., 2012). However, the increase in partial CoV sequences has caused a loss of discriminatory power of these RGU thresholds.",

However, these novel bat viruses also differ by only 5.1% from the established CoV species HKU5, implying that they share sufficient RdRp sequence identity to be classifiable within both an RGU defined either by MERS-CoV or by HKU5. Re-analysis of all available RdRp sequence data for the present paper indicated that the 4.8% threshold previously determined for alphacoronaviruses could be maintained. In contrast, a revised lower threshold of at least 5.1% amino acid sequence distance in this RdRp fragment was necessary to accommodate all betacoronavirus species included in the current ICTV proposal (de Groot et al., 2012) and the novel partial CoV sequences.",

An even bigger increase of overall CoV sequence entries can be observed after 2009. This is likely due to both the advent of next-generation sequencing techniques and changed GenBank policies requiring host information from submitters. Fig. 1B shows that the proportion of bat CoV sequences among the 5489 overall CoV entries containing host information is small, compared to those from hosts such as ungulates, birds and carnivores. Possible explanations for this difference are likely the veterinary relevance of livestock and pet CoVs and the usage of prototype viruses as laboratory models leading to sequence entries, e.g., for BCoV, TGEV, FIPV and IBV. Still, the number of bat CoV entries (n\n = 390) almost equalled that of HCoVs (n\n = 460). However, the lack of host information for HCoVs probably introduces a bias in this comparison.",

The impact of the SARS-epidemic in 2002\u20133 on the number of CoV publications was tremendous, leading to a near four-fold increase to around 700 published studies per year after 2002. Similarly, the identification of SARS-related CoVs in bats led to around 15 studies on bat CoVs per year after 2005. Of note, this figure also shows that scientific publications began to decrease a few years after SARS-CoV disappeared. The emergence of the MERS-CoV is likely to counteract this phenomenon in the years to come.",

Similarly, Hipposideros betacoronaviruses from Thailand, Kenya, Nigeria and Ghana are closely related (Gouilh et al., 2011, Pfefferle et al., 2009, Quan et al., 2010, Tong et al., 2009) and the betacoronavirus HKU9 has been detected in different species of flying foxes in Africa and Asia (Anthony et al., 2013b, Lau et al., 2010b, Tao et al., 2012, Watanabe et al., 2010, Woo et al., 2007). Of note, the detection of both host-specific and -nonspecific mammalian CoVs parallels what can be observed in the avian Coronavirinae genera. For example, infectious bronchitis virus (IBV, genus Gammacoronavirus) has been detected in a wide range of birds, while the recently described deltacoronaviruses appear to be more host-specific (Chu et al., 2011).",

A striking counter-example is the large number of bat alphacoronaviruses that cluster together with the prototype viruses HCoV-229E, -NL63 and PEDV (Fig. 3). Viruses from numerous bat hosts, together with ungulate and human viruses, are contained in this part of the Alphacoronavirus tree, and in contrast to the betacoronaviruses, the designation of clearly separated subclades is challenging.

In line with these differences, a bat SARS-related coronavirus synthesized by reverse genetics was only infectious in cell culture and mice when the spike gene was exchanged by the human SARS-CoV homologue (Becker et al., 2008). Because the RBD of European rhinolophid bat SARS-related coronaviruses was more related to that of the human SARS-CoV than the RBD from Chinese bat viruses (Drexler et al., 2010), recombination may have played a role in the emergence of the human pathogenic virus.",

HCoV shedding in feces is not uncommon (Liu et al., 2004), and there are sporadic reports on CoVs in humans with gastroenteritis, e.g., a case report on BCoV in a pediatric patient leading to the tentative designation Human enteric coronavirus (Zhang et al., 1994).

This is compatible both with the use of bat fecal material or intestinal specimens to detect bat CoVs in almost all published studies and with the high CoV RNA concentrations in the lower intestine of naturally infected hedgehogs (Corman et al., 2013a). Although there are no apparent clinical signs of gastroenteritis (Watanabe et al., 2010) or any other disease in bats, it should be noted that bats appear to raise antibodies against their coronaviruses at high rates (Lau et al., 2010b, Lau et al., 2005, Muller et al., 2007, Tsuda et al., 2012).

Similar phenomena have been observed for other bat-associated viruses, such as the filo-, henipa-, astro- and lyssaviruses (Amman et al., 2012, Drexler et al., 2011, George et al., 2011, Wacharapluesadee et al., 2010). Still, respiratory or vertical CoV transmission cannot be ruled out at this point, mostly due to the necessity of shielding these protected animals from human interference. Hypothetically, one could question whether insectivorous bats that rely on a functional larynx for echolocation of prey could even tolerate respiratory infection. This highly speculative scenario could point to an evolution of bat (corona-) viruses towards infection outside the respiratory tract. Alternatively, it could represent a sample bias due to the rapid death and decay of bats suffering from any respiratory disease that impairs predation, a likely scenario given the very active metabolism of bats, which for example requires insectivorous bats to consume several grams of insects per night (Encarna\u00e7\u00e3o and Dietz, 2006).",

Loss of discriminatory sharpness upon the increment in known CoV genetic diversity will likely limit these approaches, although the ICTV criteria may prove more robust, due to the larger genomic fragments incorporated. From a technical point of view, it should be noted that the extension of the RdRp fragment size used for RGU definitions can be challenging when field specimens contain low RNA concentrations (Corman et al., 2013b, Drexler et al., 2010). A similar difficulty can be observed for the ICTV proposal, which requires the characterization of approximately 50% of a typical CoV genome. The more than 20 unclassified CoV species in the current ICTV proposal demonstrate that this task is not easily fulfilled for viruses which have not been grown in culture (de Groot et al., 2012). Furthermore, both approaches do not incorporate any sequence distance-based data from genomic regions encoding the structural proteins. Besides the technical constraints on characterizing these genes that were stated above, this is likely also due to the poor sequence alignments some of these genes entail. The high variability, e.g., of the Spike gene, complicates the establishment of criteria applicable to the complete subfamily. Still, incorporation of some of the more conserved structural genes, such as the Envelope, Membrane or parts of the Spike and Nucleocapsid genes may prove helpful in carrying out this promising genome-based taxonomic approach.",

These hallmarks require further consideration. First, the large CoV genomes indeed allow for the accommodation of several genes, putatively enhancing virus pathogenicity. For example, the evolutionary origin of the highly variable SARS-CoV accessory proteins is largely unknown, and deletion of these genes strikingly decreases virulence (McBride and Fielding, 2012, Narayanan et al., 2008). Similarly, among CoV genomes, only members of the betacoronavirus clade contain a hemagglutinin-esterase related to that of influenza C viruses (Zeng et al., 2008), compatible with putative inter-viral gene exchange. Still, little is known about how and when CoVs can incorporate novel genes into their genomes. The technical difficulties observed with the usage of CoV-based vectors for heterologous gene expression indicate that, at least in vitro, the introduction of foreign genes into a CoV genome is not an easy task (de Haan et al., 2005, Sola et al., 2003). Additionally, there are many examples of smaller RNA viruses containing numerous accessory genes that enhance virulence, such as HIV-1 at only a third of the typical CoV genome size (Malim and Emerman, 2008).",

In contrast to CoVs, influenza A viruses cause regular epidemics or even pandemics. Still, the large number of zoonotic HCoVs emphasizes their potential to infect animals other than their original mammalian hosts, and demonstrates the value of continuous screening of humans and wildlife for potentially emerging pathogens. However, it should be kept in mind that sequence detection alone does not warrant premature conclusions as to the zoonotic potential of such viruses (Deeks et al., 2013, Drosten, 2013). Authentic risk assessment strategies would, for example, rely on infection experiments employing isolated or synthetically reconstructed viruses. In the specific case of the CoVs, identification of genomic markers associated with the viral potential to switch hosts or with increased pathogenicity may enable alternative studies.
