            "text": "Scholars have identified specific batterer behaviors aimed at sabotaging economic efforts and maintaining economic power and control as a distinct type of IPV (Adams et al. 2013; Stylianou 2018a). Evidence of unique consequences and specific patterns of behavior have led scholars to call for economic abuse (EA) to be considered as a separate form of abuse deserving specific attention to its dynamics, patterns, and impacts (Adams et al. 2008; Postmus et al. 2012, 2018; Stylianou et al. 2013). EA is comprised of tactics that hinder economic self-sufficiency and harm economic self-efficacy through financial exploitation, economic control, and employment sabotage (Adams et al. 2008; Postmus et al. 2012; Weaver et al. 2009). These include preventing or limiting work or school hours, stealing income or cash gifts, harassment at work or school, damaging credit history, and dominating family finances by demanding receipts, preventing access to money, or making unilateral decisions (Adams et al. 2008; Stylianou 2018a; Moe and Bell 2004; Sanders 2015; Voth Schrag and Edmond 2017; Voth Schrag et al. 2017; Voth Schrag et al. 2018; Weaver et al. 2009). These behaviors are linked to employment and housing instability, increased use of public assistance, greater material hardship, and increased economic dependence on abusive partners for financial stability (Adams et al. 2013; Goodman et al. 2009; Voth Schrag 2016). Economic abuse has also been shown to impact the health and mental health of victims of IPV. EA has been linked with negative health outcomes such as gastrointestinal syndromes, psychosomatic symptoms, pelvic problems, and psychological problems, as well as mental health impacts including increased risk of depression (Stockl and Penhale 2015; Stylianou 2018b; Voth Schrag 2016). Data also show that historical experiences of EA can reverberate through survivors\u2019 lives for years due to on-going issues with debt, credit, employment, and economic self-sufficiency (Toews and Bermea 2017; Ulmestig and Eriksson 2017).",

Additionally, a recent study found lifetime prevalence rates of economic abuse among women at 15.7% in an Australian sample (Kutin et al. 2017). However, in the United States few studies have examined the dynamics of EA outside of IPV service settings, and those that have often have used non-standardized measure of EA (Postmus et al. 2018).",

Similarly, Tolman and Wang (2005) found a 10% reduction in work hours over 3 years for survivors. The link between IPV and poverty is particularly concerning because economic hardship can further the cycle of violence, deepening women\u2019s dependence on an abusive partner for basic needs and security for themselves and their children (Adams et al. 2008; Brush 2004; Kutin et al. 2017; Power 2006). Conversely, economic well-being can provide a buffer against on-going dependence on an abusive partner and may be an important pathway to safety from long-term abuse at the hands of a current or future partner (Adams et al. 2013). However, differences in economic impact by type of IPV experiences (physical, emotional, economic, etc.) is less understood.",

            "text": "Social support is the availability of individuals in a survivor\u2019s social network who provide emotional comfort, helpful advice, tangible assistance, and positive social interactions (Coker et al. 2002). Wright (2015) argues that \u201cfriends, family, or acquaintances may provide instrumental or expressive support to victimized women, which may help her to leave the relationship or cope with the victimization\u201d (p. 1335). Higher levels of social support have demonstrated to be related to increased help-seeking and decreased negative outcomes for survivors of IPV (Coker et al. 2002; Doug\u00e9 et al. 2014; Kamimura et al. 2013; Van Wyk et al. 2003). However, research concerning the relationship between social support and economic hardship is limited. Several studies have attempted to look at the moderating effects of social support on the relationship between economic hardship and psychological distress but have not found significant results (Kingston 2013; Manuel et al. 2012; Ayala-Nunes et al. 2018). Alternatively, Simmons et al. (2007) found social support was a strong indicator of economic well-being in rural, low-income, single mothers. Further, in a qualitative study exploring economic abuse and unemployment, survivors identified that one impact of job loss was the loss of emotional support and recognition from colleagues (Ulmestig and Eriksson 2017). However, the role of social support in the lives of survivors of EA and the particular impact of social support in addressing the economic impact of EA remains unclear.",

(Arnold 2009). Dutton and Goodman (2005) argue that a coercive threat must involve both a demand and a credible threat associated with not carrying out the demand. When an IPV survivor believes that the threat or consequence will be carried out, the abusive partner holds both the power of threat and the power of reward (Dutton and Goodman 2005; Stark 2007). Importantly for the current study, CCT posits that IPV survivors will have lower levels of economic stability compared to others, as an abusive partner uses various tactics (including physical and emotional violence and their resulting mental and physical health consequences, as well as tactics of EA) to increase economic dependence in order to enhance their control over all aspects of life (Stark 2007; Postmus et al. 2012).",

After study procedures were approved by the IRBs of the sponsoring university and the community colleges, the study team was provided with a complete roster of currently enrolled students. From this roster, a simple random sample of participants were recruited via their college e-mail accounts to participate in a web-based survey exploring factors influencing their quality of life and educational outcomes. Of female students randomly selected for recruitment, 15% (n = 1358) opened a recruitment e-mail. Fifty-six percent of those then opened the survey link, and 620 (84% of those who opened the survey) consented to participate. Overall, 46% of females who opened the survey e-mail consented to participate, or 12% of females contacted. Of those who consented, 36 were screened out for reporting that they identified as male, nine were screened out for being younger than 18 or not reporting an age to verify their eligibility, and 126 were screened out for not having been in an intimate relationship in the past 12 months. These participants, along with those who failed to complete the demographic questioner (n = 15), were removed from further analysis, leaving a final sample of 435 respondents. To understand the extent to which the sample reflects the broader population of community college students, the demographics of study participants were compared with data for all students enrolled in the community college system published by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES 2017). No significant differences were identified between the study sample and the demographics of the four campuses overall on any of the observed variables (see Table 1).",

The current findings suggest that it could be useful to compliment these programs with efforts specifically aimed at increasing survivors\u2019 safe and secure access to resources which can disrupt material hardship experiences. One such intervention is economic advocacy, which attempts to account for survivors\u2019 material and financial needs in the context of planning for safety from abuse (VonDeLinde 2016). It requires advocates to understand the complexities of credit, debt, banking, taxation, and saving, along with how to connect survivors with resources, make change at systemic levels, and explore unconventional routes for enhancing economic well-being (VonDeLinde 2016). Some of these routes could include evidence based interventions such as Individual Development Accounts, housing first programs, and utility assistance. These programs can complement financial education and advocacy and increase survivors\u2019 access to tangible resources in order to buffer the impact of EA on their overall economic stability and well-being (Baker et al. 2003; Sanders 2015; Sanders and Schnabel 2007).",

Interviews and surveys with survivors reveal a wide array of economically abusive tactics used by abusive partners, including stealing or controlling access to cash and in-kind material assistance (Postmus et al. 2015; Sanders 2015). Service providers can address this challenge to survivors\u2019 economic power by using a Survivor Defined Advocacy framework, which takes an individualized approach to work with each survivor, considering their own unique combination of risks and opportunities (Davies and Lyon 2014). Survivor centered economic advocacy (SCEA) provides a helpful framework for the integration of tangible supports into an individualized and survivor specific safety plan. As defined by VonDeLinde (2016), SCEA is:an alliance between survivors and advocates that addresses both the physical safety and economic safety needs of survivors through reviewing and developing creative strategies on the survivor\u2019s current, past, and future priorities. SCEA builds on the survivor\u2019s strengths and uses the advocates knowledge and experience to enhance the survivor\u2019s comprehensive safety plan. (2016, p. 2)",

This concern is somewhat ameliorated by the fact that, when demographics of survey respondents are compared with the study population on age, part vs. full time status, and race, the survey respondents are similar to the overall student body of the four campuses. However, there is still a chance that study participants vary in systematic ways from study non-participants on un-measured dimensions.
