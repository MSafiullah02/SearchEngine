Seven metrics based on three different passenger-generated datasets are proposed here.

Passengers generate various sort of data throughout their journey, as well as before and after their flight should have taken place. Some of these passenger-generated data are publicly available in close-to real-time and could be used in an aggregated and anonymized fashion to assess the state of the air transportation system. Three such data sources are considered in this paper in order to build passenger-centric metrics: data passively emitted by passenger passports at immigration, data passively emitted by their phones and data actively emitted within social media.",

Later in [6] they calculated passenger delay using monthly data from a major airline operating a hub-and-spoke network. They show that disrupted passengers, whose journey was interrupted by a capacity reduction, are only 3% of the total passengers, but suffer 39% of the total passenger delay. Wang et al. in [7, 8] showed that high passenger trip delays are disproportionately generated by canceled flights and missed connections. 9 of the busiest 35 airports cause 50% of total passenger trip delays. Congestion, flight delay, load factor, flight cancellation time and airline cooperation policy are the most significant factors affecting total passenger trip delay. These studies, based on BTS or airline data, have highlighted the disproportionate impact of airside disruptions on passenger door-to-door journeys, already showing that traditional flight-centric metrics do not capture the full picture.",

These studies were a first validation that passenger-centric data can be used to have a view of the overall health of the Air Transportation System that is complementary to the traditional flight-centric approach. A major weather perturbation impact on passenger experience in airports was studied using this same approach and the study was complemented by an additional passenger generated data source, i.e. social media, in [21] . In Europe, a similar approach was conducted within the BigData4ATM project * by Garcia-Albertos et al. [22] who were able to measure door-to-door travel times of air passengers between two Spanish cities, Madrid and Barcelona, thanks to mobile phone data. However mobile phone data is proprietary data and is not often publicly available for research.

In Europe, Terpstra et al. also studied how a real time Twitter analysis could provide valuable information for the operational response of a natural disaster crisis management with the case of the storm hitting a festival in Belgium [28] . Regarding the air transportation field, most works mining Twitter data focus on airline sentiment analysis, with Breen [29] explaining how to mine Twitter textual data and create sentiment classifiers or Wang et al. [30] proposing an improved airline sentiment classifying method. These works focused essentially on improving the available methods for sentiment analysis without proposing any direct use of their results to improve airline service or passenger satisfaction. Monmousseau et al. in [31] used publicly available social media data created by passengers to accurately estimate and predict the hourly aggregated status of the US air transportation system.

Only Raleigh-Durham International Airport (RDU) closed its immigration service between the US ban of EU travellers and before the US entered a Level 4 travel advisory. It is to be noted that John Wayne Airport (SNA) has no immigration data since January 5 th 2020. Starting March 22 nd 2020, the number of airports not generating any immigration data steadily increases with nine airports shutting down their immigration services in ten days. Another nine airports then stop generating immigration data in ten days starting April 12 th 2020. Figure 1 indicates that BOS does not have any immigration data on April 22 nd 2020 even though it is one of the selected airport of entry for US citizens coming from high-risk areas. This illustrates the fact that the influx of international passengers is so low that they had no arriving international passenger to their immigration service for at least one day.",

The idea behind the airport visitor efficiency score is to incentivize airports to keep the flow of people coming in and out of their airports as fast as possible. The time limit of 60 minutes concerns essentially visitors dropping off or picking up a passenger, and hopefully some passengers on domestic flights, where the overall security screening process is faster than for international flights. Most airlines and airports recommend their passengers on international flights to arrive two to three hours ahead of their flight's scheduled departure time, therefore the idea behind the airport visitor slugginess score is to measure the validity of this recommendation.",

Figure 5 (a) shows the daily evolution of the number of passengers arriving at JFK's immigration and confirms the important huge drop in the number of arriving international passengers to the US from an average 35.6 thousands passengers arriving at immigration a day down to barely 360 passengers a day. Compared to the years 2018 and 2019, with an average of 45.9 thousands passengers, the difference is more important, since the number of passengers arriving at JFK's immigration is usually higher in April than in March. Figure 5 Figure 5 (c) shows the evolution of the daily average load factor (Definition 1). After the lockdown and travel ban measures, the load factor drops significantly from an average of 42.5 before the measures down to around 8.5, which represents a 80% drop. This indicates that after the measures, an immigration booth has about five times fewer passengers to process per hour. Or from the passenger perspective, each passenger has about five times more open immigration booths to take care of them. This has a direct positive impact to the average wait time at immigration for passengers. Figure 5 ",

Delta has the steepest descent but also the sharpest recovery. The case of Alaska Airlines is particular: a #AlaskaHappyHour campaign, which gave the opportunity of winning free flights to Alaska, took place in the beginning of March 2020. This campaign could explain the increase in the expressed mood in passenger tweets between March 1 st 2020 and March 5 th 2020 and could as well as compensate the effect of the travel ban announcement.",

For example, in the case of an important number of cancellations, many passengers will go on Twitter and use the keyword \"cancel\" to express their concerns directly to the airline they were flying with. Figure 9 shows the evolution of the normalized number of occurrences of the keyword \"cancel\" in tweets written by passengers from February 1 st 2020 to April 12 th 2020 for four US legacy airlines and three US low-cost carriers. The normalization is based on the total number of passengers transported by each considered carrier over the year 2018 using BTS data [37] . Figure 9 (a) indicates that the passengers of the four legacy airlines considered are reactive to the international situation; an important increase can already be seen around the date of Italy's lockdown announcement. A second spike then occurs once the US announces that it bans all travellers from the EU, China and Iran, with Delta Air Line passengers being, in proportion, the most vocal on Twitter. This could indicate that Delta Air Line has a greater proportion of its US passengers traveling in the EU at that time. Alaska Airlines had an early spike in the number of tweets containing the keyword \"cancel\" compared to the other legacy airlines. That early spike could be link to the fact that most of the first US cases of COVID-19 were discovered on the US West Coast, which is where Alaska Airlines main hub is located. Figure 9 (b) shows the evolution in the mood expressed in passenger tweets for the three considered low-cost carriers. Passengers of Southwest Airlines are the less vocal in proportion on the matter of cancellation, with a slight increase in number of occurrences of the keyword \"cancel\" in their tweets almost entirely contained within the period between Italy lockdown announcement and the rise to a Level y travel advisory for the US. Passengers of JetBlue Airways have a Figure 9 Number of occurrences of the keyword \"cancel\" in tweets written by passengers normalized by the number of total passengers per carrier over the year 2018 using BTS data [37] behavior similar to legacy airlines in this case. Spirit Airlines passengers waited for the US travel ban announcement to express massively their concerns using the word \"cancel\". Figure 10 shows the evolution of the number of occurrences of the keyword \"cancel\" in tweets written by airline customer sservices from February 1 st 2020 to April 12 th 2020 for the same four US legacy airlines and three US low-cost carriers. Please note that the y-axis scale is different between Figure 10 (a) and Figure 10 For legacy airlines, the behavior shown in Figure 10 (a) is similar for three out of four of the considered airlines. There is a significant increase in the number of occurrences of the keyword \"cancel\" starting the Italy announced its lockdown and that number then slowly decreases. For American Airlines, after a similar increase in the number of occurrences of the keyword \"cancel\", that number does not decrease but fluctuates at a level more important than during the period before the travel restriction measures where announced.",

Figure 11 (a) shows that legacy airlines all have a steep increase in the number of occurrences of the keyword \"refund\" in passenger tweets at the announcement of Italy's lockdown and then a very slow decrease, with Alaska Airlines have an anticipated spike at the beginning of March 2020. Figure 11 that Southwest Airlines increase in the occurrences of the keyword \"refund\" is still lower and resorbs faster than the other low-cost carriers and that the spike for Spirit Airlines passengers starts only at the announcement of the US travel ban. Figure 12 shows the evolution of the number of occurrences of the keyword \"refund\" in tweets written by airline customer services from February 1 st 2020 to April 12 th 2020 for the same seven US airlines. Figure 12 (a) shows the evolution of the number of occurrences of the keyword \"cancel\" within tweets of customer service of the four considered legacy airlines. The initial increase is similar than for the keyword \"cancel\" (Figure 10(a) ), however there is then a second increase towards the end of March 2020, this increase being most visible within the tweets written by American Airlines. From a low-cost carrier perspective, Figure 12 (b) illustrates the same idiosyncracies as in Figure 10 (b): Two spikes around the US announcements for Southwest Airlines, this time with higher fluctuations afterwards, one major spike on March 13 th 2020 for JetBlue and not even one occurrence of the keyword \"refund\" over the whole period for Spirit Airlines.",

Over the period of January to March, the daily average of open booths per hour is significantly higher in 2020 than in 2018 or 2019, with an average of 10.2 for 2018 and of 11.7 for 2019. From a load factor perspective, the situation at IAD is quite similar to the situation at JFK. Figure 6(c) shows the daily evolution of the immigration load factor at IAD.
