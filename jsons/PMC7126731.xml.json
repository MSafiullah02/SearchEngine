During this time it has become widely appreciated that, \u201cCleaning of hard surfaces in hospital rooms is critical for reducing healthcare-associated infections.\u201d2 Unfortunately, the complexity of the interrelated factors necessary to optimize the safety of surfaces in the patient zone remains an evolving challenge. Precisely defining how the impact of various surface cleaning interventions and optimized hand hygiene practice can be validated to develop clinically grounded implementation guidance has yet to be substantially realized.1, 3 Despite such ongoing challenges, it is important to recognize that environmental hygiene represents a critical element of what Wenzel and Edmond define as \u201chorizontal interventions\u201d that are central to mitigating a wide range of HAIs.4, 5 These approaches aim to reduce the risk of infections caused by a broad range of pathogens by the implementation of standard practices that are effective regardless of patient-specific conditions.6 In contrast to the horizontal interventions, \u201cvertical interventions\u201d are pathogen and/or condition specific. They remain important in defined settings and become most cost effective when the indications for their use are most clearly defined. Although vertical and horizontal approaches are not mutually exclusive, there is evolving evidence that horizontal interventions in endemic situations may represent a best use of HAI prevention resources.6 Recent well-designed studies of chlorhexidine bathing and decolonization as well as expanded use of contact precautions in ICUs seem to have significant potential for HAI reduction, at least in certain settings.6 Furthermore, the use of vertical interventions has recently been shown of critical value in optimizing safety with emerging pathogens, such as Ebola virus and the Corona virus associated with MeRS.7, 8\n",

As indicated in Fig. 1\n, hygienic cleaning and hand hygiene as well as interventions related to instrument reprocessing, air quality, water quality, and physical setting design are all horizontal interventions. All these horizontal interventions represent elements of health care hygienic practice. Although these elements have traditionally been discussed independently, their effectiveness in clinical settings is substantially interrelated, in particular environmental hygiene and hand hygiene, as discussed later. The term, environmental hygiene, with respect to health care, can be defined as cleaning activities directed at removing and/or killing potentially harmful pathogens capable of being transmitted directly from surfaces or indirectly to susceptible individuals or other surfaces. As such it consists of both the physical cleaning of surfaces as well as surface disinfection cleaning (see Fig. 1). Although liquid chemistries are well established as the most clinically useful approach to surface disinfection, innovative approaches that may have the potential for complementing traditional liquid chemistry have been developed over the past several years. Each of these aspects of environmental hygiene is discussed in detail whereas the other components of health care hygienic practice (see Fig. 1) are addressed in other articles of this issue.",

Eight similar studies have confirmed an average 120% increased risk of the subsequent occupant becoming colonized or infected with MRSA, vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), Clostridium difficile, pseudomonas, and Acinetobacter.10, 11 As a result of a range of investigations, important insights have been gained into the basic epidemiology of health care surface pathogen transmission, as summarized in Table 1\n.

Unfortunately all these basic culture methods are difficult to use for programmatically monitoring cleaning practice because of the need to determine precleaning levels of contamination for each object evaluated to accurately assess cleaning practice due to the intrinsically low bioburden of health care environmental surfaces.10 For this reason, swab system cultures are used primarily to identify specific pathogens to help clarify the epidemiology of possible environmental hygiene\u2013related outbreaks or hyperendemic transmission problems.46\n",

A recent study confirmed the ability of such a process to evaluate thoroughness of cleaning practice.61 In the study, 10.5% of precleaning cultures were without measureable bioburden using this system before cleaning.

Although nonstandardized fluorescent powders and lotions have been used in a noncovert manner for education,68 the fact that these substances are visible in ambient light precludes their use in programs to objectively monitor cleaning practice as a result of their ability to induce a Hawthorne effect.66, 67 Because fluorescent gel cannot be used to detect the presence or absence of specific organisms, its exclusive use in pathogen-specific outbreak evaluations is not feasible.46 Because the removal of the fluorescent gel represents a physical removal of an applied substance, the possibility has been raised that surfaces may have been effectively disinfected but not necessarily cleaned well and may be flagged as not being effectively cleaned.57 Because the use of liquid disinfectant chemistries involve a concomitant physical cleaning process, that is, wiping the surface, which has been shown to result in the easy removal of the standardized fluorescent gel, such a hypothetical concern seems unwarranted.43, 66 As noted in the 2015 AHRQ technical brief, \u201cFluorescent gel is the most commonly used formulation because it dries to a transparent finish on surfaces, it is abrasion-resistant, and unlike powder, is not easily disturbed. For these reasons, the fluorescent gel formulation has been the most well-studied method to assess surface disinfection and to quantify the impact of educational interventions.\u201d57\n(p14) The report adds that additional advantages of fluorescent surface markers include their \u201crelatively low cost, ease of implementation and their use for direct feedback to the EVS staff.\u201d57\n(p14)\n",

As indicated in Fig. 4\n, after education and ongoing feedback of performance to the EVS staff, cleaning ultimately improved to 89% for the group (P<.001).50 A structured questionnaire by the hospitals completing the project found that the EVS staff at all hospitals appreciated and were enthusiastic about being evaluated, particularly because the program provided them with a new and unique opportunity to show other health care workers how well they were performing disinfection cleaning activities. Approximately half the sites reported that the program led to new senior management recognition of the value of the patient safety oriented work performed by EVS personnel, that the program redefined the EVS role in patient safety, and that the targeting system was valuable for one-on-one training. Twenty percent of the hospitals reported that the study led to identification of opportunities for improving EVS program issues related to manpower resources and communication. A similar number of sites commented on the very favorable response the program received from the board of trustees. Three of 20 sites (15%) noted that the program initially met resistance from EVS management. Three other sites noted that the program resulted in some transient anxiety among the EVS personnel, which resolved once the value of the program and its nonpunitive orientation was understood.",

Although it is not possible to exclude the impact of motivational issues on the decision by some of these sites to withdraw from the program, recent reports have confirmed high levels of administrative pressures on infection preventionists working in acute care hospitals.69 Conversely, 71% of the sites in which the initial assessment disclosed opportunities to improve disinfection cleaning were motivated enough to pursue the study and to achieve cleaning scores of greater than 80%. Furthermore, 27% of the hospitals completing the study independently maintained cleaning thoroughness at greater than 90% for more than 3 years.50 Similar sustainability of cleaning thoroughness (92%) was also found in a group of 14 hospitals in California using the same program for more than a year.70\n",

When viewed in this manner, it becomes evident that the mandates and challenges of these 2 interventions represent an inverse continuum (Fig. 5\n). For example, in the ICU setting, where hand hygiene often becomes logistically challenging and glove use without hand hygiene is frequent, there would be a particularly strong mandate to optimize hygienic cleaning. In contrast, in ambulatory settings, where there are few intrinsic barriers to hand hygiene, enhanced hygienic cleaning practices would not be strongly mandated. In this context, the specific elements of hygienic practice can be characterized along a complexity gradient (Fig. 6\n). By relating these constructs to the various settings (Fig. 7\n), interventions can be defined along the continuum outlined to provide a framework for analyzing and prioritizing the relative cost/benefit of different levels of complementary hygienic practices (see Fig. 7). By characterizing intrinsic patient/personnel risk and setting modifiers, a particular site can be moved up or down diagonally along the range of settings. For example, if an immunologically compromised person was in an ambulatory care setting, it would be reasonable to consider moving to a higher level of hygienic cleaning intervention than otherwise is warranted. Similarly if the patient population in a long-term care setting required only minimal assistance, it would be reasonable to move down the intervention continuum toward noninpatient health care settings. Once the particular features of a setting are defined in this manner, the constructs can be used to develop programmatic interventions that maximize the components of health care hygienic practice for the best cost/benefit to improving patient/personnel safety.",

Because of confounding variables (some known and some unknown) in each study, it has been impossible to specifically quantify the impact of disinfection cleaning on C difficile transmission.89 Even when a single environmental intervention, such as cleaning agent change, is pursued, published studies have not separated the thoroughness of cleaning from the specific cleaning agent being tested.90, 91 For example, it is possible that the novelty of a new cleaning agent resulted in better attention to the process of cleaning. As a result, the improved outcome may have actually been due to the heightened attention to cleaning surrounding the change in disinfectant. To date, only 2 clinical studies have compared the relative effectiveness of 2 disinfectant chemistries while controlling for this phenomenon by objectively monitoring the thoroughness of the hygienic cleaning processes in addition to microbiologic61, 74 and outcomes.74\n",

Similar studies could also be used to clarify the potential benefits of no-touch technologies and self-cleaning surfaces.3, 11, 92\n",
