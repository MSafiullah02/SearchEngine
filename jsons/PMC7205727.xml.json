We here report a case of COVID-19 pneumonia in a patient in Japan whose initial throat polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test result was negative.

She had been staying in the house of her older brother in Wuhan as of December 10, 2019, and did not visit any hospital or the Huanan seafood market in Wuhan, which is suspected as the epicenter of this outbreak. She also denied any contact with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 patients, but had attended a Chinese New Year party on January 18, 2020. Just after arriving in Japan, she experienced symptoms of malaise, throat irritation, fever of 37.5 \u00b0C, and cough, and was admitted to National Center for Global Health and Medicine, Tokyo, Japan. On admission, her body temperature was 37.5 \u00b0C but rose to 38.3 \u00b0C within the first 24 h of hospitalization. There were no abnormal physical findings. Throat swab PCR for COVID-19 on admission was negative.",

At that time, she mentioned that her older brother in Wuhan had tested positive for COVID-19; their final contact was January 19, 2020. She had also received information that one of her neighbors in Wuhan who attended the same Chinese New Year party and sat at the same table was diagnosed with COVID-19. Non-contrast thoracic computed tomography revealed bilateral consolidations and ground-glass opacity on her lung field, which was compatible with viral pneumonia. Considering the contact history, travel history, and clinical findings, we suspected COVID-19 infection and obtained an additional throat swab specimen on day 4 of hospitalization. A positive result for SARS-CoV-2 was obtained on day 6, leading to a final diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia.",

HIV screening was negative. She required oxygen at 2 L/min by nasal canula to maintain 96% SpO2. At this time, her exhaustion, nonproductive cough, and back pain were still present but the diarrhea had resolved. We started a treatment of oral 400 mg lopinavir/100 mg ritonavir twice daily on day 6, and her oxygen demand diminished and cleared on day 7. Although the nonproductive cough continued, exhaustion improved gradually thereafter. After initiation of oral lopinavir/ritonavir, diarrhea and appetite loss were detected, which were regarded as adverse effects of the medication. After day 7, her body temperature never exceeded 37.0 \u00b0C. PCR results for SARS-CoV-2 from throat swab specimens obtained on day 10, 12, 14, 15 were negative, positive, negative, and negative, respectively. The patient was discharged on day 16. Lopinavir/ritonavir was used for a total of 10 days. The overall clinical course while in hospital is outlined in Fig. 1\n.",

This case indicates the possibility of false-negative results for SARS-CoV-2 in PCR examination of throat swabs at the early phase of infection. A previous report [2] estimated the time from illness onset to the first medical visit at 4.6\u20135.8 days. In our case, the duration between onset to obtaining the first specimen was less than 6 h. In addition, the cycle threshold (Ct) value of PCR a pharyngeal swab was reported to be higher than that from a nasopharyngeal swab [3]. Another report related to a familial cluster of COVID-19 with pneumonia suggested that the Ct values of a sputum specimen were earlier (reflecting a higher viral load) than those of the upper respiratory specimen, whereas there was a negligible difference between the nasopharyngeal and throat swab results [4]. These findings indicate that a nasopharyngeal specimen might be a better choice than a throat specimen, and a sputum sample is superior to these options when available. Therefore, clinicians and infection control departments should carefully discuss the downscaling of personal protection equipment and implementing precautions after receiving a negative result of SARS-CoV-19 PCR from a throat specimen obtained in the quite early phase of symptom onset in a patient clinically suspected to be infected with COVID-19.",

There is also a possibility of false-positive result. It is essential to evaluate the pretest probability from the clinical findings, patient's contact history, and local epidemic information. In case if the result of PCR is quite different from the pretest probability, clinicians should re-perform the examination. Therefore, the system to prevent all transmission in the community by detecting all cases by PCR may not be feasible. Alternatively, self-isolation by contact history in non-endemic community and by symptoms in endemic community might be feasible to minimize this ongoing COVID-19 outbreak, not relying on the PCR examination too much.",
