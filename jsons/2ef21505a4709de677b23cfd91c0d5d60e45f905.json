            "text": "The neonatal intensive care unit is an ideal situation to incorporate good infection control policy and practice, since it lends itself not only to the spread of severe infections but also to successful interventions. A collaborative effort between neonatologists and clinical microbiologists who take on the role of infection control can successfully mount a defence against healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) . Clinical liaison between microbiologist and clinician is well established in developed countries, whereas in the developing countries such practices are yet to be widely recognized. One reason could be that microbiology results are often delayed in less technologically advanced laboratories, thus forcing the clinician to make empirical treatment decisions without consulting or depending on the microbiologist. However, technical advancement is not a prerequisite for appropriate selection of empirical antimicrobial agents, infection control practices or formulating antibiotic policies. In an environment where resources are scarce, it only requires determination and professional cooperation for suitable interventions to work.",

The equipment and infrastructure are often limited and doctors are forced to select which babies will be admitted and offered facilities such as ventilators. 4 Few state-owned centres are equipped with neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) and these are scattered across the country. Thus, in developing countries we are dealing with neonates with completely different demographic characteristics. Whereas the minimum gestational age of live-born babies managed in a NICU in developed countries is 25 weeks with birthweights as low as 300 g, the average gestational age of live-born babies in developing countries is !30 weeks with birthweights !1000 g. In a study on anthropometry and body composition of south Indian babies at birth, the mean AE standard deviation (SD) birthweight of all newborns was 2.80 AE 0.44 kg. 5 Financial constraints in developing countries limit the use of technical interventions, due to which very few neonates undergo invasive medical or surgical procedures, unlike reports from developed countries.",

Semiautomated and automated culture systems are available only in a handful of tertiary care centres. The cost of providing these services to patients is borne by the family and is often prohibitive; most clinicians treat patients empirically. Microbiological results are particularly important in neonates as signs of sepsis are often non-specific. Hence, while financial constraints are difficult to resolve, we still have the option to utilize cost-effective, alternative interventions such as infection control, which by reducing the incidence of infection will decrease the overall morbidity and mortality in sick neonates. Successful field trials for home-based neonatal care have already been reported. 2 We need to extend these achievements to healthcare settings.",

Bifidobacteria were isolated from all the neonates. Bacteroides and clostridia were isolated from 78.3%. Enterococci were isolated from all neonates, enterobacteria from 82.6%, anaerobic cocci from 52.2%. Staphylococcus aureus was the predominant species isolated from the umbilicus; it was isolated from 21.7% of neonates on the first day rising to 87% by the sixth day and represented 49% of isolates from this site. Viridans streptococci (31.4% of isolates) were the commonest species recovered from the mouth. They were present from 8 h after birth. The authors also studied the development of microbial flora of preterm neonates. 7 The numbers of infants studied were too small to draw any firm conclusions; their flora predominantly reflected the maternal genital tract. In contrast, preterm and full-term babies born by Caesarean section were slow to acquire colonizing flora as compared to those born vaginally. The skin of infants born by Caesarean section is sterile soon after birth compared to neonates born by vaginal delivery. 8 Bowel colonization of infants born by Caesarean delivery is also delayed. 9 Colonization with bifidobacterium-like bacteria and lactobacillus-like bacteria reached levels similar to vaginally delivered infants at 1 month and 10 days, respectively. Many HAIs result directly or indirectly from patient colonization; studies have shown that hospitalized patients are colonized rapidly with hospital flora. 10 Colonizing flora such as Candida albicans in the gastrointestinal tract, vagina or perineal area, can precede infection when normal body defences are impaired through underlying disease, immunomodulating therapy, the use of invasive devices, or when the delicate balance of the normal flora is altered through antimicrobial therapy. However, antimicrobial therapy to eradicate colonizing micro-organisms such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa is not beneficial and can propagate drug-resistant pathogens. 11 Immune status of the neonate A newborn infant, particularly the preterm infant and to some extent the low birthweight infant, does not have a mature immune system and is often unable to mount an effective immune response. 12 Natural barriers, such as the acidity of the stomach or the production of pepsin and trypsin that maintain sterility of the small intestine, are not fully developed until 3e4 weeks after birth. Membrane protective IgA is missing from the respiratory and urinary tracts, and unless the newborn is breast-fed, is absent from the gastrointestinal tract as well. On a cellular level, there is decreased ability of leukocytes to concentrate where necessary. These leukocytes are less bactericidal and phagocytic. At the humoral level, the newborn has low or non-existent levels of the immunoglobulin antibodies IgM, IgE and IgA. The neonate is born with IgG antibodies acquired from the mother. However, it is important to note that passive transfer of maternal antibodies does not take place till 29 weeks of gestation. This has implications for preterm infants born 25e29 weeks of gestation; they are susceptible to infection despite the mother's antibody status. There is a slow rise of immunoglobulin levels after 3 months of age to levels of older children.",

Indeed, the most common route of spread of nosocomial pathogens is personto-person transmission within the unit and during transfer of patients between units. Such incidents have been linked with outbreaks of bacterial and viral infection in the NICU. 55,58e60 The most common iatrogenic factor contributing to neonatal HAIs is hands of healthcare workers. 22,53,58,61e65 Intervention in the form of simple handwashing procedures and infection control practices has prevented outbreaks, as reported in many studies. 22,42,55,58e60,63,66 During the process of delivery, the neonate is exposed to several sources of microbes. Medical devices such as umbilical catheters, central venous catheters, urinary catheters and endotracheal tubes are commonly used in the NICU. 23, 28, 53, 54, 67, 68 Central venous catheters contributed to 48.9% of HAIs in one study 69 and was a significant risk factor (P < 0.05) in others. 20, 21, 23, 39 The nosocomial infection rate was higher in neonates subjected to device use (r \u00bc 0.26, P < 0.02). 40 About 10.8% of catheterized patients developed hospital-acquired urinary tract infection (UTI). 70 The duration of ventilation was also related to the acquisition of HAI. 71 Reuse of single-use items, a common though unsound practice in many units, has led to outbreaks of HAI. Endotracheal tubes and mucous extraction suction catheters soaked in Hibitane were associated with HAI in the labour room and the special care baby unit. 47 Baby placement services, resuscitation equipment and cleansing solutions have also been implicated in HAI. 72 An environmental risk factor often overlooked is related to the seasonal variation in the incidence of neonatal HAI. Factors such as warm climate have been associated with a rise in colonization rates with Enterobacter spp. 73 Increased humidity and increased environmental dew point at the time of use of nursery air conditioners propagates airborne dissemination of Acinetobacter spp. and has been associated with acinetobacter-related bloodstream infections. 67 Bacteria in ambient air have been reported to colonize the conjunctiva in neonates. 65 Agent factors contributing to HAI relate to the aetiological agents implicated in infection. Infection with drug-resistant organisms plays a significant role in the outcome of HAI in all patients, irrespective of their gestational age and underlying condition. Hospitalization leads to colonization of the skin and gastrointestinal tract with resistant flora found in hospitals and subsequent bloodstream infection, when the skin or mucosa is abraded. Studies have reported that administration of prophylactic antibiotics to neonates can increase the incidence of HAI with drug-resistant pathogenic micro-organisms. About 64.8e100% of neonates presenting with HAI had received prior broadspectrum antibiotics. 16, 30, 54 Clinical presentation of HAIs in neonates A summary of the most commonly reported neonatal HAI is described in Table I . 15, 16, 18, 21, 25, 31, 39, 40, 44, 61, 74, 75 A review of the findings of these studies is hampered by the variation and sometimes lack of denominator data. The reader is advised to study these reports with caution, taking into consideration the limitations mentioned earlier.",

            "text": "It is interesting to note that Gram-negative fermenters (E. coli, Klebsiella spp.) and nonfermenting Gram-negative rods such as Acinetobacter spp. and Pseudomonas spp. have established themselves as predominant causes of serious neonatal infections in the Indian subcontinent (Table II) . In contrast, the predominant organisms isolated from invasive neonatal infections in technologically advanced countries are Gram-positive cocci (coagulase-negative staphylococci, Group B streptococcus). 95 The reason for this difference is probably multifactorial and could be due to gestational age of the babies involved, the use of invasive devices (central vascular catheters and shunts), ambient moisture, humidity and the prevalent flora in the unit. Evidence supporting these risk factors has been discussed elsewhere in the review and probably merits further evaluation. Of all the fungal infections reported in neonatal patients, Candida spp. cause significant mortality and morbidity in the neonatal unit (Table III) and will be discussed in some detail here. Although the source of C. albicans infection in the NICU is often considered to be endogenous, molecular typing studies have shown that nosocomial transmission of C. albicans is the predominant mode of acquisition. 26, 96 The nosocomial acquisition of C. albicans is related to cross-contamination via the hands of healthcare workers or parents and the use of contaminated equipment. 26, 97 In one study, retrograde medication syringe fluids were significantly more likely to be contaminated with candida than other fluids being administered to the infants (P < 0.001). Candidaemia was significantly associated with total parenteral nutrition (P \u00bc 0.04) and retrograde medication administration (P \u00bc 0.02). 98 Central vascular catheters, steroid administration, endotracheal intubation and H2-blockers have also been reported as risk factors for systemic fungal infections in neonates. 66, 82 Other risk factors include prematurity, low birthweight and use of broad-spectrum antibiotics. 36 Complications of candidaemia such as endocarditis and uveitis have been reported in neonates. The onset of endocarditis was related to persistant candidaemia. Fungal endocarditis was present in 13.7% neonates with persistent disease (>5 days of candidaemia) and 3.7% patients with non-persistent disease (OR: 4.19), while uveitis developed in 3.4% patients. Mortality in neonates with persistent disease was comparable to the mortality in neonates with non-persistent disease. 81 Viruses account for about 1% of infections in hospitalized neonates. 85 The most common viral infections are due to enterovirus/parechovirus (Table IV) . Enteroviruses were responsible for the highest mortality and development of serious sequelae. 85 Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the second most common virus causing infections in hospitalized neonates (14e37%). 42,52,60,85e89 Respiratory viruses were diagnosed in 29.5% of neonates on mechanical ventilators; the most frequent was RSV (14.1%), followed by influenza A virus (10.2%). 88 In another study, nosocomially acquired RSV infection was present in 37% of neonates, 54.3% had an underlying condition predisposing to severe disease and 13% died. 52 Human parainfluenza type 3 is the most common cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia after respiratory syncytial virus. Parainfluenza type 3 virus was isolated in six of 17 neonates cultured (five symptomatic patients and one asymptomatic patient). Eighteen of 52 nursing personnel had been ill during the previous week, concomitantly with cough and nasal congestion. 93 Nosocomial transmission of rotavirus in neonates has been reported. 43, 57, 90 The onset of acute diarrhoea due to rotavirus in two neonates was followed by five neonates developing gastroenteritis with the same strain of rotavirus. 90 In another study, in 51% of inpatients with nosocomial gastroenteritis, the causative agent was rotavirus and 26% of those were premature neonates. 43 HAIs and resistance to antimicrobial agents Compared to community-acquired infections, HAIs are often caused by multi-drug-resistant pathogens. In this section we concentrate on reports from the subcontinent and other resource-poor settings. In a retrospective study of bacterial isolates from cases of neonatal septicaemia over a period of 5 years, there was a significant rise in the incidence of drugresistant Acinetobacter spp. and P. aeruginosa. 99 The incidence rate of acinetobacter septicaemia in another study was 11.1/1000 live births. 100 Other studies have also documented Acinetobacter spp. as emerging neonatal pathogens. 23, 33, 101 Susceptibility tests showed that acinetobacter isolates were resistant to two or more antibiotics, most notably to ampicillin (82.5%), cephalexin (69.6%), gentamicin (66.5%) and cefotaxime (47.8%). Most isolates were susceptible to amikacin (82.6%), ciprofloxacin (73.9%) and piperacillin (69.6%). 33 Only about 30% of bacterial aetiological agents of neonatal HAI would be covered by an empirical regimen of ampicillin and gentamicin. 102 Gramnegative organisms causing HAI in neonates were Cause of candidaemia, endophthalmitis, endocarditis, meningitis, peritonitis. Source of infection was central venous catheter. 82 Rhodotorula mucilaginosa 83 Outbreak (N \u00bc 4) of indwelling catheter-related septicaemia in NICU. Related to birthweight, gestational age, duration of parenteral nutrition, antibiotic therapy and prophylactic fluconazole. Rhizopus microsporus 84 Outbreak of cutaneous infection in preterm neonates (N \u00bc 4) . Source traced to wooden tongue depressors used in the nursery as splints for intravenous and arterial cannulation site. The combination of warm, humid conditions in neonatal incubators, particularly in association with occlusive dressings, also favours cutaneous fungal infections.",

In an investigation into the resurgence of bloodstream infections due to C. parapsilosis in one unit, after the institution of fluconazole prophylaxis, primary resistance to fluconazole was not detected. 109 Others propose a twice weekly dosing of prophylactic fluconazole to decrease candida colonization, invasive infection, cost and patient exposure in high-risk preterm infants weighing <1000 g at birth; the lower and less frequent dosing may even delay or prevent the emergence of antifungal resistance. 110 There are reports of C. albicans resistance to fluconazole (12.5%) and amphotericin-B (25%) in studies from India. 80 Newer antifungal agents, including voriconazole and caspofungin, show promise in the treatment of potentially fatal fungal infections in neonates and additional controlled studies are indicated to evaluate their role. 111 ",

This reinforces the need for scrupulous cleaning regimens rather than adopting a policy of routine environmental surveillance. However, environmental cultures may play a role in specific outbreak situations. Outbreak strains of Salmonella worthington were isolated from the baby warmer mattress, baby cot, suction machine bottle and wall of the refrigerator. 114 The role of surveillance cultures to predict the onset of nosocomial infections in neonates undergoing invasive procedures, such as exchange transfusion, has been studied. 29 The authors found that except for staphylococci, the flora from umbilical stump and umbilical vein blood in asymptomatic neonates was similar to the flora from infected neonates.",

In a study from India, there was significant improvement among the kangaroo care group compared with the conventional group, in terms of hypothermia (10/44 vs 21/45, P < 0.01), higher oxygen saturations (95.7 vs 94.8%, P < 0.01) and decrease in respiratory rates (36.2 vs 40.7, P < 0.01).

In a setting where most physicians are reluctant to use first-line agents, due to misleading or lack of sufficient susceptibility data, a qualified microbiologist is indispensable. Communication between microbiologist and neonatologist helps in deciding the most probable pathogen and in initiating the most appropriate antimicrobial therapy. The formulation of a mutually agreed antibiotic policy at community, institutional and national levels is imperative. An infection control team (ICT) comprising an infection control nurse or an infection control trained link nurse in the NICU, a neonatologist/ physician and a microbiologist must actively participate in outbreak management and infection control policy issues. In turn, it is mandatory that microbiologists balance their focus equally on diagnostic as well as clinical microbiology. Microbiological influence and involvement can be enhanced if the microbiologist joins regular clinical ward rounds and helps to raise awareness among healthcare professionals regarding all aspects of infectious disease management. Education and training is an important remit of the ICT. Besides training of healthcare staff we believe it is important to provide training to empower the mother. As the main carer in the family her education is vital; if she can be made aware of the rationale behind the microbiologist or neonatologist's advice, she will be in a stronger position to participate in the wellbeing of herself and the baby.",
