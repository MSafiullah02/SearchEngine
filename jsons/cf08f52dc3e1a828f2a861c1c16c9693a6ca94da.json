The phrase 'blessed by the algorithm' expresses the feeling of having been fortunate in what appears on your feed on various social media platforms, or in the success or virality of your content as a creator, or in what gig economy jobs you are offered. However, we can also place it within wider public discourse employing theistic conceptions of AI. Building on anthropological fieldwork into the 'entanglements of AI and Religion' (Singler 2017a), this article will explore how 'blessed by the algorithm' tweets are indicative of the impact of theistic AI narratives: modes of thinking about AI in an implicitly religious way. This thinking also represents continuities that push back against the secularisation thesis and other grand narratives of disenchantment that claim secularity occurs because of technological and intellectual progress. This article will also explore new religious movements, where theistic conceptions of AI entangle technological aspirations with religious ones.",

However, the contemporary discussion about Artificial Intelligence (AI) can often neglect the cultural influence of religion on such social systems and can occlude continuities of thought with religious conceptions of the world. Furthermore, these conversations can also present AI as a part of a teleological atheist narrative of rationality, or as a part of the larger technological modernity that drives a presumed secularisation of the world (Singler forthcoming). These views are similar in that they see the progress insinuated by our presumed 'modernity', an intellectual and historical category, as a counter to the mores of the 'backward' religious believer.",

Bender states that she begins \"with the view that spirituality, whatever it is, and however, it is defined, is entangled in social life, with history, and in our academic and non-academic imaginations\", and that, \"spiritual forms have thrived and been shaped by entanglements with the secular, including its powerful engagements with science and progress\" (2010, (5) (6) .

This article applies contemporary research methods from the overlapping and collaborative fields of anthropology and digital anthropology. The methodology is anthropological in its study of cultural trends, popular discourse, and personal interactions in a society influenced by the hype and reality of AI. In previous research, I have also been in contact with and interviewed individuals from the groups I am discussing in this article. This research also makes use of a digital, or virtual, fieldsite; digital anthropology often requires boundary-making, and by focussing down onto an 'Internet Event' (Hine 2000, 49) we create a virtual field-site for observation and participation. In this case, the BBtA tweets are the 'event', and this research has involved observing the connections, themes, identities, and motivations at play in this bounded 'moment' as well as noting trends through quantitative methods. This article also rests on the six core principles of digital anthropology as outlined by Horst and Miller (2012, 3-25) which, most simply put, argue for the value and reality of the digital existence for users and anthropological research. A more detailed discussion of digital anthropology and use of its approach appears in my ethnography of the Indigo Children (Singler 2017b, 19-38) .",

            "text": "Other scholars recognise elements of theism in the discourse around AI and its potential impact on our future. Robert Geraci suggests in his 2010 book, Apocalyptic AI: Visions of Heaven in Robotics, Artificial Intelligence, and Virtual Reality, that AI can fulfil the same role in apocalyptic imaginings as a singular theistic god. Bearing in mind that the biblical apocalypse is an optimistic cosmic transformation, he also draws out parallels with the aims of AI, which often describe hopeful aspirations for a world-yet-to-come, an AI eschatology. In an early part of this particular work, Geraci draws on Rudolph Otto's 1917 description of god as mysterium tremendum et fascinans (Otto 1917) , using it to identify a type of awe-inspiring and fearsome being that at different times in our history can be a god, or in our contemporary modern world, AI. Elsewhere, Geraci's work has engaged with virtual worlds, drawing attention to the role of transhumanists, including Giulio Prisco, discussed below, in claiming new potential spaces to practice and evolve religion towards transhumanist ends. In such spaces, including Second Life and the World of Warcraft (the MMORPG-a massively multiplayer online role-playing game), Geraci argues a step closer to the fulfilment of transhumanist salvation is being made-\"a heavenly realm to inhabit\" (Geraci 2014 177) . Twitter is another virtual space, but one dominated by discourse rather than aesthetics and virtual embodiment like Second Life and World of Warcraft. However, this article proposes that the expressions of religious metaphor, parody, and tropes on Twitter as in the BBtA tweets represent continuities of theism, continuities enabled by new technological spaces as well as uncertainties about the nature and the volition of 'the algorithm'.",

Randall Reed pares this kind of god down to three theological characteristics (with long historical and philosophical roots) that often map easily onto our conceptions of AI superintelligences. These are omnipotence, omniscience, and omnipresence (Reed 2018, 7) . Reed also raises the question of omnibenevolence. He notes that AI philosophers such as Nick Bostrom of the Future of Humanity Institute have focussed on the issues of malevolence through \"perverse instantiation\", a failure of value alignment leading to unforeseen damage from a superintelligent AI, such as in Bostrom's famous Paperclip Maximiser thought experiment (Bostrom 2003 ). Bostrom's Orthogonality Thesis from his 2012 paper 'Superintelligent Will' is also relevant; the argument that intelligence is not intrinsically linked to 'goodness', and that an AI could have any number of combination of degrees of both characteristics (Bostrom 2012) .",

The difference, though, is that a superintelligent artificial intelligence may become in fact an entity with god-like power and, therefore, presents a danger to humanity and a challenge to religion\" (Reed 2010, 12) . This argument, however, misses quite how much such 'real world' apocalyptic scenarios and debates about value alignment are products of apocalyptic scientistic cultures themselves, and I find myself in agreement with Geraci on this point. Narratives influenced by existing Science fiction representations of AI also appear in apocalyptic AI thought experiments too and recognising the 'slippage' between fictional representations and non-fictional representations of AI is critical, and also, I propose, increasingly relevant to discussions of AI ethics.",

However, this article is not seeking solutions to value alignment problems, but instead pays attention to the theistic narratives that exist in our conceptions of AI. In which case, any algorithmic polytheism we see is interesting because of how it suggests that technology is encouraging alternatives to the cultural norms of monotheism that these users are likely more used to in a 'western' context. 1 Another of the other interesting questions raised by Reed concerning ideas of god-like AI (and which is a subset of the value alignment/control question) is: \"how do we move a god?\". This article does not seek to address this question from a theological perspective, that is not its methodological approach. Instead, through the BBtA tweets below, we will examine the number of ways people answer this particular question in a modern era with technology like AI in the 'god-space'.",

Certainly, not in comparison to the millions of tweets and retweets some memes and catchphrases can generate, expressing digital 'virality' or success. However, two factors make BBtA an interesting topic of enquiry even given the relatively small corpus of such tweets. First, BBtA tweets involve examples of not only parody, but also of metaphorical language, and even ontological assertions about the way the world really works, and there is slippage between these modes in people's interpretations of the tweets. Thus, the BBtA tweets are a useful starting point for considering the impact of even casual online comments on public discourse. Second, the BBtA expression can be explored for the variety of conceptions of the agency, or super agency, of algorithms/AI, in the public mind, with connections made with other representations of superintelligent AI. 3 This article will primarily explore the second factor, with reference to the first as a much larger offline ethnographic study would be needed to demonstrate the direct effect of the BBtA tweets on the much larger offline discourse. We will, however, note how in one specific tweet (to be called 'the Coleman Lyft tweet') there is a recordable flow of influence from the offline to the online, and we will consider this tweet in more detail below.",

There are discussions online about what factors influence the algorithm, such as location and rating, and how it might be 'gamed' (e.g., Quora 2019). However, as with many systems utilising algorithms for decision making, the process is not transparent to the gig workers. This lack of transparency may well fuel the feeling that the algorithm has agency when gig economy workers are fortunate in the jobs they receive.

Almost all of these answers map onto to familiar theistic interpretations of how to gain a god's/or gods' favour. There are also historical and contemporary precedents for money being involved in transactions with gods/religions. Although, 'selling' your soul in the Abrahamic traditions is ordinarily about doing a deal with the devil, not with god. The theistic cultural currents involved in the BBtA tweets are, therefore, obvious through consideration of their content.

However, parody and metaphor can influence conceptual thinking, belief-systems, and the formation and development of new movements. In previous work on new religious movements (NRMs) I have explored how online discourse-including parody and metaphorical language-can feed into the tripartite Weberian scheme for the legitimation of religion: charisma, rationality, and tradition. Commonly, the study of NRMs has focussed on the first of these, especially in relation to individual leaders originating and growing groups and movements. However, I showed how online conversations can form the basis of a 'new' tradition that can be referred to, leading to a snowballing of legitimation as the conversation online encourages more awareness of the NRM and more conversation about it (Singler 2014 ). In the case of BBtA we saw the spike of tweets and retweets in March 2018 due to the Coleman Lyft tweet, which is then followed by a larger conversation, even at this quite small sample size of 181 tweets overall. We can also recognise that these BBtA tweets exist within a broader, more diffuse and less quantifiable conversation outside of Twitter that also employs theistic tropes, narratives, metaphors, and religious parody about AI. A part of this conversation is the development of specific AI NRMs, which rest upon a bed of popular discourse, parody, and metaphor that imagines AI in theistic ways and which acquire legitimation through that very conversation.",

Professor of Jewish studies and Modern history Hava Tirosh-Samuelson's consideration of the leaders and shapers of the transhumanist and futurist movements recognises Prisco's role in carving out the potential space of online games for his ideas, as we noted Geraci does in Virtually Sacred (2014) above. However, Tirosh-Samuelson also describes Prisco and his transhumanist compatriots as desiring the end of humanity through the rise of the posthuman: \"the major stages of the narrative are largely the same: humanity will reach its perfection when it designs and executes its own collective death, its own suicide\" (2018).
