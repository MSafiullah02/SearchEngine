Yet the report's language is far from a call to arms. Its buzzword slogans about \u201cmore research for better health\u201d trade in mood rather than critical thinking. Colourful but indistinct, the use of \u201cmood\u201d is a way of engineering consent, of selling ideas; a method of getting the audience to feel rather than understand. Furthermore, \u201cmood\u201d is powerfully addictive; those who trade in the word find it irresistible that you never need to define what you mean. We believe that making health policy and systems more evidence-based requires more than mood.",

We learned how Hong Kong used the police department's information system to control severe acute respiratory syndrome, how the Tanzania Essential Health Intervention Project influenced resource allocation at district level, how WHO's Health InterNetwork Access to Research Information initiative bridges the digital divide, how the Meningitis Vaccine Project aims to transfer technology to developing countries, and much more. Case-study boxes are normally used to fill space. In this report, they are apposite and fascinating, bringing application of health research to life. Unfortunately, the report does not offer a convincing discussion on how these practical examples of links between research and health-systems development could be scaled up. The question remains: what happened to the charcoal?",
