The first two parts of the replicase, nsp1 and nsp2 are somewhat enigmatic, but appear to work by interfering with host defenses rather than by directly supporting virus replication. Subunits nsp3\u20136 contain all the viral factors that are necessary to form viral replicative organelles (Angelini et al., 2013), as well as two proteinases that are responsible for processing all of the viral replicase proteins (Ziebuhr et al., 2000). The small subunits nsp7\u201311 comprise the viral primer-making activities and provide other essential support for replication (Donaldson et al., 2007b, Imbert et al., 2006, Miknis et al., 2009).

This is followed by the primer-making activities of nsp7\u201311 which also interact with downstream capping and RNA synthesis factors (Bouvet et al., 2010). Finally, in the proper framework, the RNA-synthesizing enzymes from the C-terminus of the replicase are able to function. While this may be an appealing way to think of the replicase, the reality is probably much more complex. The replicase proteins are all processed from large polyproteins, and therefore are produced at the same time. Because of this, the order in which different proteins are active during the viral replication cycle remains poorly understood.",

More generally, transfected nsp1 mRNA that was capped and polyadenylated decreased host protein synthesis, and the inclusion of actinomycin D (to block new transcription) showed a much stronger inhibition of protein synthesis in the presence of nsp1, demonstrating that that while translation of new transcripts was proceeding (in cells not treated with actinomycin D), translation from pre-existing transcripts was blocked by nsp1. Decreased mRNA levels and decreased translation of pre-existing mRNA, presumably as a result of degradation, were also seen during infection with SARS-CoV.",

A partially schematic model of the nsp3 structure is shown (Fig. 3). Inferring from the presence of PL2pro cleavage sites at both termini of nsp3, the observed glycosylation at positions 1431 and 1434 in the ZF domain of SARS-CoV (Harcourt et al., 2004) and the homologous region of MHV (Kanjanahaluethai et al., 2007). SARS-CoV nsp3 contains two transmembrane spans, placing the first 1395 residues (including the PL2pro domain), and the last 377 residues (the Y domain) on the same face of the membrane (Oostra et al., 2008). The two TM helices probably consist of residues 1396\u20131418 and 1523\u20131545. This transmembrane topology is similar to that proposed for MHV nsp3 (Kanjanahaluethai et al., 2007). Between helices two and three, there is a central, absolutely conserved tetrad of cysteines (CX14\u201318C4\u20135C2C) \u2013 which may represent a Zn finger \u2013 which is likely on the same side of the membrane as the domains N- and C-terminal to the TM region.",

This region of nsp3 adopts a macro H2A domain fold. The putative active site and substrate-binding residues were conserved in its three structural homologues yeast Ymx7, Archaeoglobus fulgidus AF1521 and Er58 from E. coli, and its sequence homologue, yeast YBR022W, a known phosphatase that acts on ADP ribose-1\u201d-phosphate (Appr-1\u201d-p or ADRP). The notable exception is that proposed active site residue Asp90 in YMX7 is an alanine in both the SARS-CoV ADRP (Ala50) and AF1521 (Ala44). Histidine residues in both enzymes proximal to the terminal 1\u2033 phosphate of the substrate (His45 in ADRP and His39 in AF1521) might therefore be involved in catalysis (Saikatendu et al., 2005). Alternatively, the predominant nucleophile in the catalytic site may actually be an Asp or Glu in the conformationally flexible loop 101NAGEDIQ107 in SARS-CoV and the corresponding region in other coronaviral ADRPs (Saikatendu et al., 2005). The former proposition was verified by site directed mutagenesis data in the HCoV-229E ADRP, which showed that residues Asn37, Asn40, His45, Gly44 and Gly48 are part of the active site in the SARS-CoV ADRP (Putics et al., 2005).Box 2Key nsp3 and nsp4 structures\n\n",

            "text": "The role of an ADRP in the coronavirus life cycle may closely parallel that in the eukaryotic tRNA splicing pathway (Culver et al., 1993, Phizicky and Greer, 1993, Saikatendu et al., 2005, Snijder et al., 2003). In coronaviruses, an early post infection event is the transcription of a nested set of sub-genomic mRNAs. Each sub-genomic mRNA contains a short 5\u2032-terminal \u2018leader\u2019 sequence derived from the 5\u2032 end of the genome (Lai and Holmes, 2001a, Lai and Holmes, 2001b, Thiel et al., 2003). The fusion of the two noncontiguous RNA segments is a poorly understood process. It is thought to be achieved by a discontinuous step in the synthesis of the minus-strand and involves transcription regulatory sequences (Pasternak et al., 2001, Thiel et al., 2003). In eukaryotes, pre-tRNA splicing is initiated by cleavage at the splice site by an endonuclease. The resulting tRNA fragments are then ligated to yield mature tRNA that retains the 2\u2032 phosphomonoester group at the splice site (Phizicky and Greer, 1993). Using NAD as an acceptor, a phosphotransferase removes the 2\u2032 phosphate to yield ADP-ribose-1\u2033-2\u2033 cyclic phosphate (Culver et al., 1994). A cyclic phosphodiesterase then hydrolyzes Appr>p to yield Appr-1\u2033-p (Culver et al., 1994) (Martzen et al., 1999). Finally, a phosphatase converts Appr-1\u2033-p into ADP-ribose and releasing inorganic phosphate. While the equivalent for the cyclic phosphodiesterase appears absent in the SARS proteome, the Appr-1\u2033-p phosphatase (SARS ADRP) and an endonuclease (nsp15) are present. Characterization of an Appr-1\u2033-phosphatase-deficient HCoV-229E mutant revealed no significant effects on viral RNA synthesis and virus titer (Putics et al., 2005).",

It auto-PARylates itself, and in case of extreme DNA damage, gets overactivated and depletes the cell of its nucleotide pool. If ADRP binds PAR, then it can bind proteins that are PARylated, including PARP. Indeed, binding the latter may be most beneficial, since it can tether down this protein, slow down apoptosis, and prevent nucleotide depletion, prolonging viral replication and transcription in the infected cell.",

            "text": "Unlike many coronaviruses that encode two papain-like protease, SARS-CoV has a single copy of papain-like cysteine protei ase (PL2pro) that cleaves polyprotein 1a at three sites at the N-terminus (177LNGG\u2193AVT183, 815LKGG\u2193API821, and 2737LKGG\u2193KIV2743) to release nsp1, nsp2, and nsp3, respectively (Harcourt et al., 2004, Thiel et al., 2003). SARS-CoV PL2pro is also a deubiquitinating enzyme; it efficiently disassembles diubiquitin and branched polyubiquitin chains, cleaves ubiquitin-AMC substrates, and has de-ISGylating activity (Chen et al., 2007b, Lindner et al., 2005). Thus, PL2pro may have critical roles not only in proteolytic processing of the replicase complex but also in subverting cellular ubiquitination machinery to facilitate viral replication. Thestructure of a PL2pro construct nsp3:723\u20131037 revealed a ubiquitin fold (residues 723\u2013783; UB2) and a well-ordered papain-like protease catalytic domain (residues 784\u20131036; PL2pro) (Ratia et al., 2006). The catalytic domain adopts the canonical \u201cthumb, palm and fingers\u201d domain architecture. The thumb domain is formed by four prominent helices, the palm is made up of a six-stranded \u03b2-sheet that slopes into the active site, which is housed in a solvent-exposed cleft between the thumb and palm domains, and a four-stranded, twisted, anti-parallel \u03b2-sheet makes up the \u201cfingers\u201d domain. Two \u03b2-hairpins at the fingertips region contain four cysteine residues, which coordinate a zinc ion with tetrahedral geometry. Mutational analysis of the zinc-coordinating cysteines of SARS-CoV PLpro, that zinc-binding ability is essential for structural integrity and protease activity (Barretto et al., 2005). PL2pro has several structural homologues from the cysteine protease superfamily, the most significant being USP14 and HAUSP, both of which are cellular DUBs. The active site of PLpro consists of a catalytic triad of cysteine, histidine, and aspartic acid residues, consistent with catalytic triads found in many PLpro domains. The recent structure of the TGEV PL1pro demonstrates that the coronavirus-like PLpro folds have a common architecture (Wojdyla et al., 2010), and likely arose through gene duplication.",

Although the significance of this domain in these proteins is not well established, it has been demonstrated that the presence of the ubiquitin-like domain in USP14 and Ubp6 serves a regulatory function by mediating interactions between these deubiquitinases and specific components of the proteasome (Hu et al., 2005, Leggett et al., 2002). Comparisons of deubiquitinase activities between wild-type and mutant Ubp6 lacking the Ubl domain reveal that these associations are responsible for a 300-fold increase in catalytic rate and serve to activate the enzyme (Leggett et al., 2002). It is intriguing to consider that the Ubl-like domain of PLpro may instead act as a sort of \u201cdecoy\u201d or \u201clure\u201d to detract cellular ubiquitinating enzymes from other viral proteins, or it may mediate protein\u2013protein interactions between the replicase components.",

Instead, from the structures, it is apparent that the role of the third catalytic residue has been taken over by a conserved water molecule that often lies within hydrogen bonding distance of H41. The role of a conserved \u201ccatalytic\u201d water molecule has long been recognized in many proteolytic cleavage schemes, especially in serine proteases (Perona et al., 1993). The mechanism of substrate hydrolysis is however similar to its cysteine protease cousins, in which the acylation (the first step) is performed by His 41, which acts as a general base and helps the sulfur atom of the catalytic cysteine residue's sidechain to carry out the nucleophilic attack on the backbone C\n000000000000\n000000000000\n000000000000\n111111111111\n000000000000\n111111111111\n000000000000\n000000000000\n000000000000\nO group of the peptide bond to be cleaved (Yin et al., 2007). The first transition state is a tetrahedral intermediate (TI-1). The next step of the cleavage cycle is the implosion (collapse) of this transition state and leaving of the C-terminal half of the peptide product from the active site. At this stage, the other portion of the peptide substrate is covalently bound to the enzyme via a thio-ester linkage. In the other half of the reaction cycle (the de-acylation step), a water molecule that is activated by His41 acts as a nucleophilic hydroxyl ion (OH\u2212), attacks the carbonyl atom of the thioester and releases the N-terminal half of the peptide product, thus regenerating the cysteine. Many excellent and exhaustive studies have based this mechanism of catalysis and the structure of the catalytic site architecture to design several different classes of peptidomimetic inhibitors targeted against Mpro of coronaviruses (including SARS) and other pathogenic viruses. Several Mpro inhibitors have also been structurally characterized (Akaji et al., 2011, Bacha et al., 2008, Chu et al., 2006, Chuck et al., 2013, Grum-Tokars et al., 2008, Lee et al., 2007, Lee et al., 2009, Lee et al., 2005, Shan and Xu, 2005, Shao et al., 2007, Turlington et al., 2013, Verschueren et al., 2008, Wei et al., 2006, Yang et al., 2006, Yang et al., 2003, Yang et al., 2007, Zhang et al., 2010, Zhu et al., 2011).",

The presence of additional non-transmembrane hydrophobic domains near authentic transmembrane domains is a common theme running through the DMV making proteins nsp3, nsp4 and nsp6. IBV and SARS-CoV nsp6 have been shown to activate autophagy, inducing vesicles containing Atg5 and LC3-II (Cottam et al., 2011). MHV Nsp6 is relocalized when it is co-expressed with nsp4 (Hagemeijer et al., 2012), suggesting that the two proteins interact.

Much of the structure derived functional information about nsp7 and nsp8 came from the study by Rao and co-workers (Bartlam et al., 2005, Zhai et al., 2005) who determined the 2.4 \u00c5 resolution crystal structure of the nsp7/8 supercomplex (Fig. 5\n). Eight subunits of nsp7 and nsp8 each form a tight hexadecameric complex. In this complex, nsp7 reveals a tertiary structure that is similar to its solution structure with the minor deviation in that the fourth helix is oriented at a slightly different angle and is more ordered. This is possibly due to its existence as a complex with nsp8 in crystals. SARS-CoV Nsp8 adopts two major conformations described as the \u201cgolf club\u201d and the \u201cbent golf club\u201d fold, which has an extended long shaft domain with three helices (one of which is very long) and a globular core at the C terminus (Zhai et al., 2005).",

Typical extension products were found to be <6 residues long. Nsp8 effectively polymerized poly(rC) and oligo(rC15) templates and poly(rU) to a weaker extent but not poly(rA). This accessory polymerase, which is both catalytically weaker and has a lesser fidelity than the main viral RdRp (nsp12), was potently inhibited with 3\u2032-dGTP and to a lesser extent by ddGTP and 2\u2032-O-methyl-GTP suggesting an avenue for possible therapeutic inhibition.

All of these residues localize on the long \u03b1-helix (the stem of the golf club) and map onto one of several dimer interface regions of the supercomplex. The main function of nsp8 overall appears to be to catalyze the synthesis of short stretches of RNA primers that can be utilized by the primer-dependent main SARS polymerase nsp12. Using dual labeling immunofluorescence microscopic studies, Prentice and co-workers have shown that nsp8 co-localizes along with nsp2 and nsp3 in cytoplasmic complexes, which also contain the protein LC3, which is a general marker for autophagic vacuole (Prentice et al., 2004).",

Nsp9 colocalizes in the perinuclear region along with other components of the replication complex (Bost et al., 2000).

Originally described as a growth factor-like protein on the basis of high cysteine content and sequence homology (Gorbalenya et al., 1989), nsp10 is a highly conserved component of the coronavirus replicase machinery. Reciprocal BLAST searches using various nsp10 homologs identify a region of homology near the carboxyl terminus of polyprotein 1a in more distantly related nidoviruses such as torovirus and the newly identified white bream virus (Schutze et al., 2006). However, no region of nsp10 homology has been noted to date in the ronivirus or arterivirus lineages of the Nidovirales. Bioinformatic analysis of nsp10 does not yield any consistent matches to conserved enzymatic signatures. Thus, the profile of nsp10 more likely fits a role as an auxiliary replicase component, rather than an essential replicase enzyme.",

It was further noted that this defect in nsp10 could not be compensated in cells by co-infection with viruses harboring temperature-sensitive lesions in nsp4 or nsp5, suggesting that coronavirus polyprotein 1a (at least from nsp4 onward) forms a single functional unit important for coronavirus discontinuous negative-strand RNA synthesis (Sawicki et al., 2005). Mutagenesis studies have confirmed the importance of nsp10 for general RNA synthesis and for controlling the ratio of subgenomic to genomic RNA (Donaldson et al., 2007b). Deletion of nsp10 or rearrangement of the genes encoding nsp7\u201310 completely inhibited virus growth, while alteration of the Mpro cleavage site between nsp9 and nsp10 reduced viral growth (Deming et al., 2007). An unexpected finding was that the temperature sensitive lesion in nsp10 correlates with a severe inhibition of Mpro activity at the non-permissive temperature (Donaldson et al., 2007a). From these results it appears clear that the function of nsp10 is closely tied to viral RNA synthesis. Nsp10 is now known to form part of the viral mRNA cap methylation complex (Bouvet et al., 2010) which is discussed below with the viral methyltransferase subunits.",

The palm subdomain of SARS-CoV nsp12 (residues 585\u2013625 and 680\u2013807) forms the catalytic core and contains the four highly conserved sequence motifs (A\u2013D) found in all polymerases and a fifth motif (E) unique to RdRps and RTs (Poch et al., 1989). The core structure of the palm subdomain is well conserved across all classes of polymerases.

DsRNA also significantly enhanced exonuclease activity of the enzyme (Minskaia et al., 2006). DNA and ribose-2\u2032-O-methylated RNA are resistant to cleavage (Minskaia et al., 2006). The activity of nsp14 is strictly dependent on divalent cations (Chen et al., 2007a). Its activity was highest in the presence of Mg2+ or Mn2+, lower in the presence of low amounts of Zn2+ (0.5 mM) and undetectable with Ca2+ or higher concentrations of Zn2+. With Mn2+, the size of the product is slightly smaller than that obtained with Mg2+ or Zn2+, indicating that the metal ions may modulate the configuration of the active site differently (Chen et al., 2007a, Minskaia et al., 2006).",

Recombinant viruses with mutations in the nsp14 active site were defective in growth and RNA synthesis and possessed 15-fold more mutations than wild-type viruses. Nsp14 therefore appears to play a role in error prevention or repair of nucleotide incorporation during RNA synthesis (Eckerle et al., 2007). Recombinant HCoV-229E containing mutations in the active site of nsp14 had severe defects in RNA synthesis and no viable virus could be recovered. Besides strongly reduced genome replication, specific defects in sg RNA synthesis, such as aberrant sizes of specific sg RNAs and changes in the molar ratios between individual sg RNA species, were observed (Minskaia et al., 2006). Sperry et al. (Eckerle et al., 2006, Sperry et al., 2005) have shown that a Tyr\u2192His mutation (equivalent to SARS-nsp14 Tyr420His) in an infectious clone of MHV-A59 shows attenuated virus replication and virulence in mice, also arguing for the importance of this protein as a proof-reading component of the viral replication machinery. Based on temperature-sensitive mutants of MHV, Sawicki et al. (2005) showed that nsp14 is essential for the assembly of a functional replicase-transcriptase complex and appears to affect the positive-strand synthesis, as would be expected for a protein involved in both capping and mismatch repair.",

It is one of the most well studied RNA processing enzyme of the coronaviral replicase with several recent studies focusing on its structural and functional characterization due to its potential importance as a drug target.

This enzyme is a specific marker for coronaviruses as no known homologs of nsp15 exists among other RNA viruses outside of nidovirales. Nsp15 preferentially cleaves the 3\u2032 end of uridylates of RNA at GUU or GU sequences to produce molecules with 2\u2032\u20133\u2032 cyclic phosphate ends (Bhardwaj et al., 2004).

The coronaviral structures have revealed a three-domain architecture (Fig. 6\n). Again not surprisingly, the catalytic C-terminal domain contains a novel fold. The first two domains (residues 1\u2013190) have a topological similarity to methyltransferases forming a \u2018spitting image\u2019 of the SAM-dependent methyltransferase fold as defined in SCOP database (Murzin A, personal communication; Fig. 6). The full length MHV and SARS nsp15 enzymes were shown to be packed as hexamers, their biologically relevant oligomeric state, forming a hollow, toroid shaped structure. Hexamerization is absolutely essential for both metal ion binding and catalytic activity (Guarino et al., 2005). The eukaryotic homolog XendoU from X. levis is much shorter (missing the first two domains) and shares only the conserved catalytic domain. In fact, it was the first structure of this endoribonuclease fold to be structurally characterized. It is a functional monomer in solution. The catalytic center of nsp15 retains features that resemble the active site of an unrelated nuclease, RNase A (Cuchillo et al., 2011).",

            "text": "While the enzymatic activity of nsp15 is now fairly well understood, the role of nsp15 in the coronavirus replication cycle is not. Nsp15 cleaves at uridylates preceded by cytidylate or adenylate residues. When model RNA substrates were 2\u2032-O-ribose methylated, it blocked endonucleolytic activity, indicating a possible functional link between nsp15 and the 2\u2032-O-ribose methyltransferase nsp16. A structure based catalytic mechanism of endonucleolytic activity of nsp15 was proposed by Ricagno et al. (2006b), based on active site similarities with RNAse A. In this model, Lys-289, His-249, and His-234 residues act as the main catalytic triad while Ser-293 and Tyr-342 provide the supporting role by stabilizing the aromatic ring of the nucleotide. Despite structural uniqueness of nsp15, the actual mode of sessile bond cleavage is thought to be very similar to those of several RNAses of this class that share the same catalytic triad e.g., RNAse T1, RNAse A and others. The six active sites of the hexamer are spatially segregated and are thought to function independent of one another. The actual electrostatic contribution of the Mn2+ ion in catalysis is unclear. In XendoU, Mn2+ does not impede either RNA substrate binding of cleavage (Renzi et al., 2006). However, fluorescence experiments indicate that upon metal ion binding, the protein undergoes large structural transitions suggesting an indirect, possibly structural role for metal in either stabilizing the enzyme in a catalytically competent \u201con\u201d state from an otherwise inactive \u201coff\u201d state (Renzi et al., 2006). Drawing analogies with endonuclease EndN, a Zn dependent enzyme, Ricagno and co-workers have hypothesized that, given its proximity to the catalytic site, Y342 might be the residue involved in Mn2+ ion binding by forming a cation-II interactions, assisted by the histidine H249 and the 2\u2032-O-ribose moiety of the substrate. Molecular modeling and docking studies led Renzi et al. (2006) to propose a similar mechanism for endonucleolytic cleavage by the eukaryotic homolog XendoU, wherein the O4 of UMP nucleotide forms a potential hydrogen bond with the catalytic histidine H178 and the pyrimidine ring of the nucleotide involved in stacking interaction with the aromatic ring of tyrosine Y280.",

Nsp16 adopts a canonical S-adenosyl-l-methionine dependent methyltransferase fold, with a central beta sheet framed by a helical clamp and a conserved catalytic KDKE tetrad (Martin and McMillan, 2002). The nsp16 topology matches those of the dengue virus NS5 methyltransferase (Egloff et al., 2002) and vaccinia virus VP39 O-methyltransferase (Hodel et al., 1996). The structure of the nsp16/nsp10 interaction interface shows that nsp10 interacts with and probably helps to stabilize the S-adenosyl-l-methionine binding pocket. This has the effect of making the putative RNA-binding groove of nsp16 longer. The study by Decroly et al. (2011) also demonstrated that the methyltransferase inhibitor sinefungin interacts with the nsp16 active site, and could therefore form the basis of a new generation of inhibitors that attack the coronavirus methylation process. The structure of nsp10 was found to be virtually identical when solved in the presence and absence of nsp16 (Chen et al., 2011, Decroly et al., 2011, Joseph et al., 2006, Su et al., 2006).",

The generic nomenclature that's been widely adopted is m7G(5\u2032)ppp(5\u2032)X(m)pY(m) where m7G corresponds to the modified 7-methylguanosine nucleotide. O-methyltransferases such as nsp16 perform the final step of cap synthesis, which involves adding a methyl group to the first nucleotide following the m7G, and sometimes adding a methyl group at the same position on subsequent nucleotides. While the m7G cap is essential for efficient translation splicing, nuclear export, translation and stability of eukaryotic mRNA, O-methylation is not (Cougot et al., 2004, Lewis and Izaurralde, 1997, Schwer et al., 1998).",

(2011) explored the role of nsp16 methylation in the viral replication cycle and found that O-methylation acts as a recognition marker that helps the host cell to recognize its own RNA species, and respond to incompletely methylated cap structures. Nsp16 makes replication possible by camoflauging newly synthesized viral RNA to resemble host mRNA, which therefore blocks the induction of an interferon response. This suggests that drugs that act on nsp16 have the potential to interfere with viral replication both at the level of inhibition of the replication process, and in promoting intracellular recognition and response to viral RNA species.",

This is the first proteome-scale structural characterization of a coronavirus, and one with a disproportionately large number of singletons. The new folds are significantly contributed by the 16 nonstructural proteins of the replicase machinery, several of which do not have counterparts outside Nidovirales. Ideally, new folds enable us to model sequence homologues, thereby filling out the immediate neighborhood in structure space. This is non-trivial for SARS-CoV proteins, since the new folds are (so far) either true sequence singletons (nsp1, nsp2 nsp3a, sars9b) or found exclusively in Coronaviridae (nsp4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, spike RBD, sars9a).",
