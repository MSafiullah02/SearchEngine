Current knowledge about virulence and pathogenicity of Deformed wing virus (DWV), a major factor in honey bee colony mortality, is limited. With this study, we close the gap between field research and laboratory investigations by establishing a complete in vitro model for DWV pathogenesis. Infectious DWV was rescued from a molecular clone of a DWV-A genome that induces DWV symptoms such as crippled wings and discoloration. The expression of DWV proteins, production of infectious virus progeny, and DWV host cell tropism could be confirmed using newly generated anti-DWV monoclonal antibodies. The recombinant RNA fulfills Koch's postulates circumventing the need of virus isolation and propagation of pure virus cultures. In conclusion, we describe the development and application of a reverse genetics system for the study of DWV pathogenesis.",

Natural populations of European honey bees are threatened or already extinct in many parts of the world. Parasitic infections cause a decline of feral honey bee colonies even in their original habitats [7] . Colony mortality is associated with strong Varroa destructor mite infestation and a rapid decrease of the adult bee population [8, 9] . The mite Varroa jacobsoni, a parasite of the Eastern honey bee (A. cerana), adapted to A. mellifera in the 1950s giving rise to the new species V. destructor [10] . Due to colony and queen bee trade, V. destructor has spread to all continents with the exception of Australia [11] . The global invasion reached central Europe in the 1970s and the USA in the 1980s [8] . Nowadays, bee colony survival depends on human supervision, intervention and regular control measures such as biotechnical or miticide treatments [12, 13] .",

These deformities were closely associated with DWV infections as previously shown using experimental infection of pupae [15] . DWV is present in almost every beehive throughout the year, but DWV symptoms only occur in heavily Varroa infested colonies [16] . Overt DWV infections, characterized by the appearance of DWV symptoms at a colony level, are indicative of a colonies downfall and occur primarily during autumn [17] . There is general consensus that a synergistic interaction between DWV and Varroa mites plays an important role in colony mortality [18] [19] [20] [21] . The Varroa mites' feeding behavior transmits DWV directly into the bees' haemolymph [16, 22, 23] , bypassing the natural barriers of the bees body against conventional vertical and horizontal routes of virus transmission [24, 25] .",

A recent phylogenetic analysis supports the hypothesis that a DWV epidemic started in the mid of the 20 th century coinciding chronologically with the Varroa mites' host switch to A. mellifera [26] . DWV belongs to the genus Iflavirus within the family Iflaviridae. Iflaviruses are members of the order Picornavirales with a Picornavirus-like genome organization and particle morphology [14] . DWV is separated into the three master variants DWV-A, -B and -C [27] . Master variant A contains the classical DWV strains [28] and Kakugo virus [29] , which are responsible for elevated colony mortality [18] . DWV-B includes the strains of Varroa destructor viruses (VDV), which are able to protect colonies by superinfection exclusion against DWV-A [30] . High recombination frequencies between different DWV strains and master variants have been documented in the field [31, 32] . However, only a few genomic sequences of DWV field strains have been deposited in databases and recombination was not proven in vitro using clonally selected viruses.",

Defined cell culture systems, serological reagents, characterized viral strains or clones are effectively missing despite decades of intense research. So far, all studies used bee models and virus isolates originating directly from the field or from propagation in bee infection models. The use of virus isolates from field samples, which had not been plaque purified in cell culture (biological cloning), may result in misleading conclusions. Multiple virus strains, master variants or even species could be present at the same time in such field isolates. The application of reverse genetics allows circumventing virus isolation, clonal plaque purification and production of clonal viruses in cell culture systems. To our best knowledge, no reverse genetics system has been presented for DWV or any other member of the genus Iflavirus. For bee viruses in general, a single publication reported on the generation of infectious transcripts of Black queen cell virus (BQCV) achieved by the assembly of full-length PCR products with a suitable recognition site for the T7 RNA polymerase [36] .

Amplicons from an A-tailing RACE and from a C-tailing RACE reaction were cloned and sequenced to uncover the ultimate 5'-end of DWV-A 1414. The majority of clones from both reactions contained a 5'-end sequence that was longer than any of the publicly available full-length DWV genome sequences (Fig 2A) . As expected, most of the 5 0 -NTR was highly conserved between all DWV strains. However, a 5'terminal stretch of 10 nucleotides was missing from Kakugo virus (DWV-A, AB070959) and at least 21 nucleotides were missing from all other DWV-A genomes and Varroa destructor virus 1 (DWV-B, AY251269, Fig 2B) . A length difference of 14 nucleotides was observed, when comparing DWV-A 1414 (KU847397) to the recently published genomic sequence of DWV-C (ERS657949) [27] . A phylogenetic analysis demonstrated the close relationship between published DWV-A sequences and our Austrian field strain from 2012 ( Fig 2C) . Pairwise identities to DWV-A 1414 are 98.0% for a DWV-A strain from Pennsylvania (AY292384), 97.6% for a DWV-A strain from Italy (AJ489744), 97.4% for a DWV-A strain from Chile (JQ413340.1), 96,7% for Kakugo virus (AB070959), but only 81.4% for Varroa destructor virus (DWV-B, AY251269.2).

A mean viral load of 2.4 x 10 8 GE/bee of rDWV was found in the transfected bee pupae using qRT-PCR. The rDWV was passaged in novel bee pupae using 0.5 \u03bcl of the lysate (1.2 x 10 5 GE) obtained from the transfected pupae. After infection, the mean viral load of rDWV was 2.0 x 10 10 GE/bee in the second and 2.5 x 10 10 GE/bee in third passage. In parallel, we passaged the DWV-A 1414 isolate (wtDWV) using 0.5 \u03bcl of the described crude pupa lysate. A mean viral load of 8.2 x 10 10 GE/bee was obtained from passage three of wtDWV. Mock infected pupae, which originated from the same combs, were used as controls in these experiments. DWV RNA was not detectable in the mock infected controls. A different RT-PCR assay was performed to differentiate between wtDWV and rDWV. The RT-PCR amplicons from rDWV transfected and rDWV infected bee pupae were completely fragmented after BamHI digest (488 and 276 bp) confirming the rescue of recombinant virus and the absence of field virus replication (Fig 5A and 5B) . Western blot analysis of pupae infected with the field virus using the VP1 specific mAb DWVVP1A1 revealed large amounts of mature VP1 (46 kDa) and of an unknown 19 kDa protein, while only a weak signal of VP1 and of the 19 kDa protein was found after transfection of rDWV RNA (Fig 6A) . However, a strong VP1 expression was observed after rDWV infection of pupae in subsequent passages. Interestingly, the mAb DWVVP1B1 showed no reactivity with the 19 kDa protein (Fig 6B) .",

These symptoms are indicative of a DWV infection; however DWV is frequently detected in healthy colonies at the same time. The exclusion of additional pathogens responsible for colony mortality is excessively difficult, taken the lack of classical virological tools into account. The same applies for laboratory experiments reproducing the pathogenicity of DWV, in which certain requirements of Koch's postulates were already fulfilled [15] . Robert Koch defined strict criteria for the establishment of a causative relationship between a microbe and a disease, first published in 1884 [42] . These strict criteria include the isolation of a microbe from a diseased host, its growth in pure culture and the reproduction of the disease in a healthy host after experimental inoculation. Furthermore, the microbe must be re-isolated from the diseased experimental host and identified as being identical to the cultured microbe. Multiple attempts have been made to adapt Koch's postulates to chronic diseases [43] , sequenced-based identification of pathogens [44] , general association of environmental factors and disease [45] , or the role of genes and their products in pathogenesis [46] . Pure virus cultures depend on biological cloning methods in defined cell culture systems, which have yet to be established for honey bee viruses. In this study, we applied molecular cloning to generate a pure DWV inoculum to better fulfill Koch's postulates.",

The ability to genetically manipulate the infectious agent is pivotal for controlled investigations of RNA viruses [47] . Infectious clones exist for a large number of positive-stranded RNA viruses, including picorna-, alpha-, pesti-, arteri-, and coronaviruses with genomes up to 30 kb. Reverse genetics has been a key technique for elucidating viral pathogenesis and the functions of viral gene products [48] . Here, we present the first plasmid based reverse genetics system for a DWV-A genome. Key feature of this DWV-A clone is the identity of the 5'-end that exceeds previous full-length DWV sequences by 10 to 21 nucleotides. Sequence comparison to other members of the family Iflaviridae demonstrates a high diversity of the 5'-terminus [49] . Preliminary bioinformatics analyses suggest a stem loop structure downstream 10 unpaired nucleotides at the very 5'end. Further experiments are needed to unravel function and twodimensional structure of the 5'-NTR. It is noteworthy that the plasmid based copy of the DWV genome originated from a full length PCR product. This approach not only simplifies the construction of the cDNA clone but also warrants that not different-possibly incompatible-fragments of the DWV quasispecies cloud are joined.",

            "text": "The eponymous clinical sign of DWV-A infection of bee pupae is the atrophy or misfolding of the wings, which is caused by vector borne DWV transmission [15, 50] . The unfolding and stretching of the wings represents the first step of a bee's development after molting to an imaginal stage in their holometabolous metamorphosis. Multiple factors might impair the sensitive process of hymenoptera wing development. Unsuitable incubation conditions, pupal injuries, the lack of a cocoon, hormonal disorders [51] and intoxication [52] have been shown to result in the emergence of adult bees with crippled or malformed wings. We were able to reproduce the typical clinical signs of DWV infections using synthetic RNA derived from a plasmid clone of DWV-A. Pathogenicity of the DWV-A clone was assessed by a high titer infection experiment showing a morbidity rate of 90%. In contrast, equivalent infections with the field isolate DWV-A 1414 caused a morbidity of 80%. Differences in the morbidity rate might be due to a clonal infection in case of the recombinant virus, compared to an infection with a cloud of divergent genomes in case of the field virus isolate. The importance of quasispecies for DWV pathogenesis has been put forward in previous studies reflecting the natural situation in most RNA viruses [27] . On these grounds it is exciting that a single genome from the quasispecies cloud is able to reproduce disease. We now can study the speed, complexity and direction of the development of DWV-A quasispecies radiating from a single clone. Further to this, virulence factors, or more likely, virulence associated gene alterations can be investigated in detail.",

Our immunohistochemistry data underlines that DWV injection led to systemic infections affecting all parts of the bee's body. DWV-A was detected in bee heads within the neural and gland tissues, as previously described [29] . In nurse bees, the exocrine glands of the head secrete the royal jelly. Since signals of DWV VP1 were detected in all secretory glands of the head, an evolutional adaptation of DWV to oral transmission is very likely [53] . Nutrient exchange is a continuous process in the bee colony that might contribute to transmission, horizontal infection and persistence of DWV in honey bee colonies [15] . The application of the reverse genetics system will provide a new basis to study the factors of DWV host cell tropism and to investigate the molecular mechanisms behind DWV transmission. ",

The PCR product of pupae transfected with rDWV-RNA (lane A4), infected with passage one rDWV (lane A6) and with passage three rDWV (lane B2) was converted in 488 bp and 276 bp fragments after BamHI digestion. In contrast, the PCR products of wtDWV infected controls (lane A5, A7, and B3) are not cleaved by BamHI. Arrows on the right side indicate the size of the respective visible RT-PCR products and fragments. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0164639.g005",
