However, the combination of 'routine' antibacterial prescribing and belief that the patient expects to be prescribed an antibacterial has created a positive feedback loop whereby the prescriber may feel reluctant to discuss not using antibacterials with many patients. This feedback loop must be broken, and it requires the application of a general practitioner's professional integrity to take this step with each new consultation.",

A direct question to the patient will determine what the patient expects and whether they really expect to be given an antibacterial. If the patient does not expect an antibacterial and you do not feel they require one, the consultation can conclude to everyone's satisfaction. If the patient expects an antibacterial and you believe they do not need one, you have an opportunity to discuss with them why they don't need one.

In this context, it is better to give information that is personalised ('we know now that antibiotics will not help you') than to quote from studies and metaanalyses and systematic reviews. One part of achieving this personalisation is to emphasise the personal risks of taking antibacterials: adverse reactions such as rash, and the risk of becoming colonised with a resistant bacterium that will be harder to treat when they really do need antibacterials. The practitioner may choose to stress the effect on normal flora in terms of thrush (candidia-sis), diarrhoea and selection of a resistant strain or creating a vacuum for a resistant strain to be picked up from someone else.",

Emphasising the positive effects of symptomatic treatments and providing more detailed prescriptions of how these could be used, as well as the value of antibacterials only when they are really necessary, can give the patient some sense of control. One method of achieving this is to write a 'symptomatic prescription' that contains instructions and useful information about the various symptom remedies; this offers the benefits of 'value for money' and 'written information' in the guise of a true script.

This means writing a prescription and suggesting to the patient that they have it filled only if certain con-ditions develop, the most common being 'worse the next day' or 'no better after 2 days' (these are fairly lenient conditions). One sore throat study in the UK used this technique as 1 of 3 arms of a prospective study and showed that more that twothirds of patients did not have their script filled. [12] Another study, in patients with otitis media, combined this strategy with a patient/parent handout and showed a significant reduction in prescribing compared with a control general practice. [13] Directed campaign: Simple but deliberate education campaigns can be effective. [14] One general practice study was able to show that simultaneous education of the prescribers in their practice, and their patients, led to a significant drop in the number of prescriptions (table II) . Patient information was provided through a poster in the waiting rooms, at the time of consultation and by a generic brochure handed to patients who did not require antibacterials for their respiratory tract infection.",

The principal reason for treating streptococcal pharyngitis is to prevent the complications of rheumatic fever and acute glomerulonephritis. There is no doubt that antibacterials can prevent a significant proportion of rheumatic fever. However, rheumatogenic strains of S. pyogenes are now very rare in many populations in developed countries. A metaanalysis has shown no measurable effect on reducing rates of acute glomerulonephritis. [19] The value of antibacterials in preventing suppurative complications such as quinsy, otitis media and sinusitis has also been examined. One systematic review concluded that antibacterials did reduce the rates of these complications but that, because the complications themselves are infrequent, a very large number of patients need to be treated to prevent suppurative complications in a few. [23] Thus, the need for antibacterials at all has been questioned, even in patients with proven streptococcal disease. [23] A group from Canada has recently developed a scoring method to improve the likelihood of distinguishing viral from streptococcal infection [24] (fig.   1 ). This simple method, which can be performed within a minute, is based on history and throat examination, and it offers the potential for the patient to participate, giving them some power to understand the decision-making process. This group has been able to show that antibacterial use can be reduced overall in sore throat prescribing, without prejudicing outcomes.",

[25] In other countries, antigen tests are not relied upon and culture is recommended. If the scoring method is used, the likelihood of streptococcal infection is not high, and thus a throat swab is still useful. If the results of throat swab culture are negative, the correct approach is to notify the patient to cease the antibacterial. Alternatively, the conditional prescribing strategy could be used -a script written but filled only if the culture is positive.

[33] The US rationale is that there is proven benefit in some patients and that at the time of presentation these cannot be distinguished from others who will not benefit. The Dutch approach is quite different, with antibacterials being withheld for 24 to 72 hours, after which time patient contact is made to determine whether there are persistent symptoms [34] (table IV) . Australia has elected to follow the Dutch guidelines in large part. [6] It is widely agreed that amoxicillin is the drug of choice, even though resistance in the 3 important bacteria is common. The rationale is that only a small proportion of patients benefit, that resistance in the main bacterial pathogen, S. pneumoniae, is mostly low level and the pathogen will respond to amoxicillin, and that coverage is superior to that of cefaclor, roxithromycin and cotrimoxazole. In the patients who is allergic to penicillin, choices are more restricted. Second and third generation oral cephalosporins, such as cefaclor, cefuroxime axetil, cefixime, cefpodoxime proxetil, ceftibuten, cefdinir, cefprozil and loracarbef can be used, although all have less activity against strains of S. pneumoniae with reduced penicillin susceptibility than amoxicillin when pharmacodynamic factors are taken into account. [35] Intramuscular ceftriaxone can also be used. Cephalosporins should be avoided if there is a history of anaphylaxis to penicillins. The rates of resistance to cotrimoxazole (>30%) are now too high in most countries for this agent to be recommended. Newer macrolides such as roxithromycin, clarithromycin or azithromycin can be used, but their activity against H. influenzae is limited, and rates of resistance in S. pneumoniae range from 5 to 20% or more.",

[37] In patients who fail to respond to first-line treatment, the drug of choice is amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, as it is assumed that bacteria resistant to amoxicillin are still present. If the patient is penicillin allergic or reacted to amoxicillin in the previous course, all the currently available alternatives are suboptimal. The cephalosporins or macrolides noted in the previous paragraph or cotrimoxazole may be tried, but if failure is a result of penicillinresistant S. pneumoniae, there is a high likelihood of resistance to these agents as well. The new fluoroquinolones such as moxifloxacin or gatifloxacin may be used in adults, but their use in children is restricted by the current nonavailability of paediatric formulations and there is considerable controversy about whether these agents should be used at all in children because of resistance selection in pneumococci.
