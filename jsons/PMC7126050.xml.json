            "text": "Recently, a number of biologically active steroids bearing unusual side chains have been isolated from marine sponges. Whereas NMR methods can generally be applied to solve the stereochemical structure of the steroidal nucleus, the conformationally flexible side chain is less tractable. For this reason, the structures of many new biologically active marine steroids have been reported without full stereochemical assignment of the side chain [1], [2], [3], [4], [5], [6]. In the case of the potent antitumor compound aragusterol A (1), the stereochemical configuration at C-24 of the side chain was determined by the chemical synthesis of the possible isomers [7]. This work showed that the stereochemical configuration of the carbon framework of the side chain was identical with that of the sponge sterol petrosterol (2). Because steroids are biosynthetically derived from sterols, it appears likely that petrosterol (2) occurs in this sponge and serves as the precursor of 1. Petrosterol is a sponge sterol that has been extensively studied by the Djerassi group. Because petrosterol (2) as well as the unnatural C-24,25,26 stereoisomers are known compounds [8], sterol analysis of the sponge may have been useful in assigning the C-24 configuration and could have saved some synthetic effort in the structure determination of aragusterol A (1).",

            "text": "The Caribbean sponge Petrosia weinbergi is another source of structurally unusual, biologically active steroids. Orthoesterols A, B, and C (3\u20135) contain bicyclic orthoesters between the side chain and ring D, and have been reported to be active against feline leukemia virus, mouse influenza virus, and mouse coronavirus [9]. Weinbersterols A and B (6,7), also isolated from this sponge, were shown to be active against feline leukemia virus and human immunodeficiency virus with EC50 values in the micromolar range [10]. Both weinbersterols A and B and orthoesterol B bear a rare cyclopropyl side chain that has also been reported for ibisterol (8), a human immunodeficiency virus-inhibitory steroid from a deep water Topsentia sp. [11], [12], and topsentiasterol E (9), a similar steroid from a shallow water Topsentia sp. [13]. The complete stereochemical configuration of the cyclopropyl side chain has not been reported for any of these compounds. This rare cyclopropyl side chain has previously only been detected once before, in a trace sterol (0.07% of total sterols) from a marine alga [14]. However, all four 24,28-stereoisomers of this cyclopropyl sterol have been synthesized and stereochemically assigned [15], [16]. Based on the precursor\u2013product relationship between sterols and steroids, we have undertaken an analysis of the sterols of Petrosia weinbergi to shed light on the stereochemical configurations of the side chains of the antiviral steroidal metabolites.",

            "text": "It is noteworthy that a cis relationship had originally been proposed for the cyclopropyl methyl and C-23 in 4\n[9]. However, in sterol 13 a trans relationship is found, consistent with its probable biosynthesis from isofucosterol (14) [20]. The cis assignment had been made based on NOE difference spectra of 4, which showed an enhancement of signals at 1.13 ppm (cyclopropyl methyl) and 1.30 ppm (assigned as H-23) after irradiation of the high-field cyclopropyl proton at \u22120.20 ppm [9]. In our NOE experiments with 13, we observed enhancement of similar signals at 1.080 ppm (cyclopropyl methyl) and 1.266 ppm after irradiation of the high-field C-30 cyclopropyl proton (\u22120.247 ppm). However, COSY cross peaks between the 26- and 27-methyl signals (0.985 and 0.954 ppm) and 1.266 ppm show that this signal does not correspond to H-23, but to H-25. It should be noted that our assignment of structure 13 is not made on the basis of a NOE experiments, but is based on comparison with synthetic samples whose absolute stereochemical configurations rest on X-ray crystallography [15], [21].",
