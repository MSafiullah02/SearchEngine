This study describes the clinical profile and recovery pattern of swallowing following inhalation burn injury. All patients admitted 2008-2017 with confirmed inhalation burns on laryngoscopy and managed by speech-language pathology (SLP) were included. Initial dysphagia presentation and dysphagia recovery pattern were documented using the FOIS. Co-presence of dysphonia was determined clinically and rated present/absent. Persistent laryngeal/pharyngeal injury at 6 months was documented using laryngoscopy. Data were compared to published data from a large adult burn cohort. All patients with confirmed inhalation burns during the study period received SLP input, enabling review of 38 patients (68% male; m = 40.8 years). Percent Total Body Surface Area burn ranged 1-90%, 100% had head and neck burns, 97% required mechanical ventilation (mean 9.4 days), 18% required tracheostomy and 100% had dysphonia. Comparing to non-inhalation burn patients, the inhalation cohort had significantly (p < 0.01) higher dysphagia incidence (89.47% vs 5.6%); more with severe dysphagia at presentation (78.9% vs 1.7%); increased duration to initiate oral intake (m = 24.69 vs 0.089 days); longer duration of enteral feeding (m = 45.03 vs 1.96 days); and longer duration to resolution of dysphagia (m = 29.79 vs 1.67 days). Persistent laryngeal pathology was present in 47.37% at 6 months. This study shows dysphagia incidence in burn patients with inhalation injury is 16 times greater than for those without inhalation injury. Laryngeal pathology due to inhalation injury increases dysphagia severity and duration to dysphagia recovery.",

Inhalation injury is well known to be an independent risk factor for mortality and is also associated with significant morbidity, which may be observed as early or late sequelae [7, 8] . Immediately following inhalation injury, risk of respiratory distress and airway compromise frequently necessitate the need for intubation and mechanical ventilation. Patients with significant airway involvement of their burn often develop direct mucosal injury to the respiratory tract, mucosal sloughing, and inflammation ( Fig. 1) , potentially leading to airway obstruction and impaired gas exchange. These physiological changes in addition to higher fluid resuscitation requirements lead to an increased risk for pulmonary and airway oedema, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), ventilator associated pneumonia (VAP), multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) and therefore longer duration of mechanical ventilation and length of stay in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) [9] . Potential late consequences of inhalation injury may also occur. These may evidence as scarring, contracture and stenosis or stricture of the mucosal tissue, with subsequent impacts on physiological function of those structures affected [10] .",

In many cases, complete recovery can be achieved prior to hospital discharge [14, 15] , although a small proportion of patients will experience more severe swallowing impairment with a lengthy and at times incomplete recovery [14, 16] . Initiation of oral intake following burn injury has been documented to take longer in patients identified with dysphagia than in those without [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] with lengthy periods of enteral nutrition often necessary. Resolution of dysphagia after burn injury also follows a variable, and sometimes protracted period of recovery. Burn patients, identified with dysphagia, have been reported to take between 1 and 222 days to achieve their premorbid swallowing function as defined by reaching premorbid oral diet and fluids and no longer requiring the aid of supplementary nutrition, therapeutic or compensatory manoeuvres [14-16, 18, 20] .",

However, no specific sub-analysis of those patients with or without inhalation injury was conducted to determine any differential patterns of dysphagia severity. Considering that increased dysphagia severity and duration to recovery has also been connected to other factors necessary to managing inhalation injury, including endotracheal tube size and duration of intubation and tracheostomy [11, 13, [24] [25] [26] [27] , it is possible that dysphagia severity in this cohort will be even higher than in the head and neck burn population. The application of enteral feeding following burn injury is also necessary, not only as an adjunct to managing nutritional sequelae associated with dysphagia alone but also to ensure adequate nourishment to facilitate wound healing, physical and psychological rehabilitation [28] . Duration of enteral feeding in the general thermal burns population has been shown to be lengthy and often extends beyond the time that dysphagia has resolved [14] [15] [16] 23] . Again, there is high probability this also will be protracted in those with concomitant inhalation injury.",

Firstly, a majority of patients (97.37%) in the current study received intubation and mechanical ventilation with mean duration of 9.37 days, as part of their treatment. Rumbach and colleagues [13] have previously identified that the presence of ICU admission and mechanical ventilation hold positive predictive value at 56.82% and 59.92%, respectively, for the development of dysphagia. Further to this, endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation is well recognised in the literature to be associated with dysphagia [31] with current incidence rates of dysphagia post extubation documented up to 62% [32] . Mechanisms for dysphagia in the intubated population have been proposed to be related to both the underlying medical diagnosis as well as the period of oropharyngeal muscle disuse and associated atrophy [33, 34] . Furthermore, the potential physiological and anatomical damage as a result of the endotracheal tube itself cannot be dismissed. The presence of muscle atrophy and localised endotracheal tube trauma is acknowledged to be probable in the present study population. However, given the rate of dysphagia following inhalation injury exceeds documented rates of dysphagia following endotracheal intubation, this suggests that there are additional processes that are impacting swallow integrity in this cohort.",

Histologically, whilst mucosa of the tongue blade, hard and soft palate appear to be resistant to the development of scar tissue and contractures following thermal inhalation or ingestion burn injury, the floor of mouth, pharyngeal and especially laryngeal mucosa are not [35] . As such, injury to these anatomical sites are associated with elevated risk for the development of scar tissue and contractures with subsequent impact upon motor and sensory function [36] . This may be postulated to represent as a reduction of airway protection during swallowing in addition to a reduction in airway responsiveness should an aspiration event occur. This is supported by the work of Clayton et al. [16, 24, 37] and Rumbach et al.

Severe burn injury frequently induces a hypermetabolic state in burn sizes above 20 percent of the total body surface area, which can subsequently result in loss of muscle mass [28] . In the current study, the mean burn size of participants was 35.28%, thus indicating that a substantial portion of participants in this cohort had a burn size that would result in catabolism, strongly inferring that they may be at risk for acute deconditioning including oropharyngeal muscle atrophy with its resultant effects on swallow physiology. This is also supported by previous work examining the profile of dysphagia following severe burn injury [14, [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] 27] , which documents that the primary characteristics of dysphagia following thermal burn injury include oral and pharyngeal phase deficits with the presence of reduced base of tongue retraction as well as impaired pharyngeal constriction that manifests as pharyngeal retention and elevated aspiration risk.",

Whilst the majority of patients who are cognitively and neurologically intact will learn to adapt to changes in laryngeal anatomy and physiology as it relates to swallowing, should an event occur to compromise that cognitive and neurological level of function, it is plausible to hypothesise that their ability to continue to adapt and compensate following an insult may be compromised.",

Firstly, it is plausible that one cohort may have had issues with wound healing or increased nutritional needs for any one of a number of facets of burn rehabilitation, necessitating increased duration of supplementary nutrition. Secondly, given that these two cohorts were from two independent burn units, it is equally possible that habitual practices of each respective burn unit dietitian may vary slightly. As no specific nutritional parameters were recorded as a primary endpoint in this study, this aspect cannot be controlled for. The severity of dysphagia at the initial assessment of the 2 inhalation cohorts was also found to differ. As there was no significant difference in severity or injury presentation between the two cohorts, the reasons for this difference cannot be explained by the current data available.",

A prospective study of burn patients that includes set time points at which patients could complete a full battery of outcome measures pertaining to swallowing would be beneficial to fully appreciate the specifics regarding patterns of dysphagia recovery and presence of long-term laryngotracheal dysfunction. The small sample size is also a potential issue due to the known high level of heterogeneity in the clinical burn population. As this was a single Statewide service study, the need to involve multi-site data sets from other Statewide services to produce a more robust sample is recognised. However, given that characteristics of the current inhalation cohort did not differ significantly on most parameters from those with inhalation injury reported by Rumbach et al. [14] , which was set in a separate Statewide service within the same country, the authors believe that patterns reported here are potentially true indications of the nature of recovery post inhalation burn injury.",

The authors fully acknowledge that a CSE does not provide the diagnostic information as available from instrumental assessments such as FEES or videofluoroscopy. Recognising the issues associated with a CSE, it is accepted that sub-clinical symptoms of dysphagia may have been missed, or severity of dysphagia not fully appreciated. As such the data presented within this study may be in fact an under-representation of the true incidence and severity of dysphagia. Future prospective studies incorporating regular instrumental assessment are needed to fully understand the influence of damage to the pharyngeal and laryngeal structures on swallow function. The authors also accept that there is debate regarding the added benefit of including cervical auscultation in the CSE and its value in informing on swallow integrity [39] . Auscultation was simply used in this study as an adjunct measure to add to the clinical information being collected on each patient and its limitations are acknowledged. The FOIS scale also has known limitations when applied in this population due to the long-term dependence of many patients on non-oral feeding for reasons other than dysphagia. However, the absence of population specific/sensitive tools limits choice of outcome measures at present.",
