Advances in the sequencing and functional characterization of both pathogen and host genomes have provided a wealth of knowledge to clinicians, epidemiologists and public health responders during outbreaks of high-consequence viral disease. Here, we describe how genomics has been historically used to investigate Ebola virus disease outbreaks and how new technologies allow for rapid, large-scale data generation at the point of care. We highlight how genomics extends beyond consensus-level sequencing of the virus to include intra-host viral transcriptomics and the characterization of host responses in acute and persistently infected patients. Similar genomics techniques can also be applied to the characterization of non-human primate animal models and to known natural reservoirs of filoviruses, and metagenomic sequencing can be the key to the discovery of novel filoviruses. Finally , we outline the importance of reverse genetics systems that can swiftly characterize filoviruses as soon as their genome sequences are available.",

Targeted or unbiased sequencing of individual clinical samples aids in the identification of outbreaks, the determination of outbreak aetiology and the definition of virus transmission chains by identifying chain-defining single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Furthermore, field transcriptomics improves our understanding of host responses to virus infection and will be important in deciphering the differences between asymptomatic and symptomatic disease states and in predicting whether patients with acute and chronic disease will survive 8 . Functional genomics is becoming the tool of choice for the rapid characterization of patient-specific viruses that have not been isolated in culture or that cannot be equitably shared among laboratories across borders 9 . Finally, the genomic analysis of patient-specific viruses also enables precision medicine by predicting the efficacy of available medical countermeasures (MCMs) against these individual viruses.",

As the natural reservoir hosts of all of these viruses remained unidentified, despite extensive ecological studies, filoviruses were thought to be African viruses 1 . This view changed after 1989, when Reston virus (RESTV; of the genus Ebolavirus) was discovered and repeatedly identified as a lethal pathogen of captive crab-eating macaques (Macaca fascicularis) in non-human primate (NHP) breeding facilities in the Philippines 10-12 ( fig. 1 ). However, although RESTV can infect humans, it appears to be apathogenic 13 . RESTV was subsequently considered to be an Asian anomaly to the African filovirus dogma.",

            "text": "Around and after 2008, sequence-based evidence obtained using a range of techniques began to support the hypothesis that RESTV is an Asian virus. RESTV genome sequences were obtained from captive dome stic pigs (Sus scrofa domesticus) in the Philippines and China 20,21 , and RESTV genome fragments were sequen ced from samples from molossid, pteropodid and vespertilionid bats in the Philippines 22 . Next-generation sequencing further enabled the discovery of a highly divergent filovirus, Lloviu virus (LLOV, genus Cuevavirus), in deceased Schreibers's long-fingered bats (Miniopterus schreibersii) in Hungary 23 and in Spain 24 . The Ebolavirus genus was expanded owing to the discovery (via next-generation sequencing) of Bombali virus (BOMV) in molossid little free-tailed bats (Chaerephon pumilus) and Angolan free-tailed bats (Mops condylurus) in Guinea, Kenya and Sierra Leone [25] [26] [27] In short, genomics has clarified that highly divergent filoviruses, frequently with unknown pathogenic potential, are likely to be distributed widely over the African, Asian and European continents in highly diverse host reservoirs ( fig. 2 , Box 1). Furthermore, expanded animal sampling and unbiased host virome sequencing is likely to enable this diversity and distribution to be described in more detail. Of note, the natural host reservoirs of three ebolaviruses that are human pathogens, namely Bundibugyo virus (BDBV), SUDV and Ta\u00ef Forest virus (TAFV), are still unclear. Furthermore, although bats are suspected to be hosts of EBOV owing to the detection of short EBOV genomic fragments and/or antibodies to EBOV in certain bats 32 , no complete EBOV genome has yet been sequenced from any bat sample. The genomic investigation of archived or newly acquired samples could also support or refute the often-repeated hypothesis that Middle African central chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes troglodytes), duiker (Cephalophus spp.) and western lowland gorilla (Gorilla gorilla gorilla) populations are frequently decimated by EBOV infection [33] [34] [35] . Thus, genomics may enable the prevention of future filovirus disease outbreaks by identifying filovirus natural hosts and by limiting host-human contacts as well as the initial introduction of filoviruses into the human population.",

Early efforts relied on exporting positive samples to high-complexity genomic centres abroad 37, 38 (Box 2).

In addition, field laboratories used the iSeq 100 (Illumina), a portable bench-top sequencer with low error rates that can be transported in a suitcase, to obtain complete EBOV genome sequences to determine virus transmission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo 42, 43 . Use of the portable nanopore sequencing technology MinION (Oxford Nanopore Technologies) markedly reduced the time required to obtain the genome sequence from patient samples and enabled the reintroduction of EBOV into Guinea and Sierra Leone to be rapidly confirmed 41 .

However, metagenomic sequencing is limited by the requirement for computational and bioinformatics resources, which are not always readily available under field conditions. Instead, target-enrichment approaches using a wide breadth of bait probes for known pathogenic viruses, including filoviruses, have led to the successful characterization of known viruses in clinical samples from patients with disease of unknown etiology [66] [67] [68] . Moreover, target-enrichment sequencing is more cost-effective than metagenomic approaches. The percentage of sequencing data matching the target pathogen or pathogens can range from 50% to 99% with target enrichment, whereas with metagenomics approaches often <1% of sequencing data matches the target 69, 70 .",

The first application of in-country, real-time genomic epidemiology started well into the EVD outbreak of 2013-2016 in Western Africa; portable sequencing was performed and data were analysed in tangent with up-to-date public health data 41 . The abundance of EBOV genome sequences determined during recent large-scale EVD outbreaks (including the 2013-2016 outbreak and the 2018-present outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo) enabled real-time and retrospective investigations, using median-joining haplotype network establishment and phylodynamic inferences, to reveal cryptic human EBOV transmission chains in humans 42, 49, 72, 73 . In coordination with classical epidemiological data (for example, that obtained by manual contact tracing), individual virus transmission events identified by genomic analysis such as median-joining haplotype networks can be temporally and spatially linked to determine likely transmission pathways, including the mode of virus diffusion and the identification of 'superspreaders' (as reviewed in ref. 45 As the quality and quantity of avail able, complete genome sequences improves, new methods identifying intra-host SNPs may provide more granular analyses of person-to-person transmission than previous techniques 39 . Such SNPs can distinguish between almost identical consensus sequences of two or more patients 75 . However, acute infections resulting from direct contact with a recently infected and symptomatic individual, and for which primary infection occurred <21 days before the onset of symptoms, is not the only route for sustained person-to-person transmission during filovirus disease outbreaks.",

Some of these sites, including the brain, eyes and testes, are immune-privileged Box 1 | Endogenous filovirus elements the bioinformatic analysis of higher animal genome sequences, the number of which is steadily increasing, reveals that a marked percentage of these sequences are derived from ancient retroviruses 142 . Many animal genomes are mosaics that are likely to have evolved through the accidental integration of retroviral genes or gene fragments into germ cell genomes and the subsequent inheritance of this genetic material by descendants. in some cases, these sequences were positively selected for and were (or are still) expressed and their functions were exapted by hosts for novel functions 142 . a famous example of exaptation is the use of the human endogenous retrovirus w-derived syncytin, which was once a retrovirion surface glycoprotein that mediated virion host cell entry but is now essential for placental morphogenesis in pregnant women 143 .",

Prominent examples of negative-sense rNa virus-derived Nirvs are bornavirus sequences, which are found in the genomes of bats, fish, hyraxes, marsupials, primates, rodents, ruminants and elephants 145, 146 , and rhabdovirus sequences, which are found in the genomes of crustaceans, mosquitoes, ticks and plants 147, 148 . interestingly, filovirus-derived Nirvs also appear to be widespread as they have been located in the genome of afrosoricids, bats, eulipotyphlans, marsupials and rodents 145, 149, 150 . the function of these stably inherited filovirus sequences remains to be determined. However, the existence of Nirvs indicates that filoviruses are at least several million years old and that highly divergent mammals were exposed to, and at least occasionally infected by, these viruses and perhaps by the descendants of these viruses that exist today.",

Disease flare-ups or re-emergences were reported in at least nine individuals and attributed to sexual transmission or breast-feeding 84 . Sexual transmission of persistent EBOV was implicated in the initiation of new EBOV transmission chains 49, 73, [85] [86] [87] . Genomic analyses revealed that the evolutionary rate of EBOV persisting in testes during convalescence is reduced relative to the rates of EBOV persisting in blood and plasma 85, 88 . All these observations prompted a notable number of studies of the long-term effects of persistent EBOV infection in EVD survivors. Indeed, EBOV persistence can be accompanied by various sequelae, colloquially often referred to as 'post-Ebola [virus] syndrome' 89 . Studies of EBOV persistence in humans and experimentally in NHPs have revolutionized our understanding of EBOV infection and changed the guidelines of clinical operation as well as the recommendations of the World Health Organization for EVD survivors.",

Genomic centres generally had to allocate a notable portion of space to house and maintain sequencers and transporting sequencers was impractical. For example, Miseq, which is the smallest of the sequencers, weighs 91 kg and occupies ~ 200,000 cm 3 . recently, 'capacity building' efforts have established on-site genomics centres in low-resource settings 39, 40 . However, the international shipping of oversized sequencers that rely on precise optical alignments for functionality can be challenging and cost-prohibitive and may cause irreparable damage to the sequencer. the maintenance and repair of internationally shipped sequencers may also be challenging as they do not come with in-country service contracts from the manufacturers. Moreover, in low-resource settings, trained local staff may not be permanent, and they will periodically require guidance and retraining in sample handling and storage and in how to ensure the continued service and activity of the sequencers. the technological improvements in, and practicality of, portable sequencing technologies have been embraced in recent viral disease outbreaks, including in the 2018-present ebola virus disease outbreak in the Democratic republic of the Congo and a 2018 Lassa fever outbreak in Nigeria. the iseq 100 (illumina) and MiniON (Oxford Nanopore) platforms both conform to on-site field requirements as they are miniature, rapid and easy to use. the ZiBra Zika virus (ZiKv; a flavivirus of the family Flaviviridae) sequencing project in Brazil also demonstrated the feasibility of a 'trailer laboratory', but produced limited complete genome sequences owing to the small amounts of ZiKv rNa in clinical samples 152 . several commercialized mobile laboratories incorporated into trucks or trailers shield equipment and temperature-sensitive reagents from austere conditions while providing ample power and laboratory workspace for sequencing. within such mobile laboratories, smaller PCr thermocyclers, such as the programmable Mini16 thermal cycler with a smartphone (miniPCr bio\u2122), and miniature centrifuges further bolster portability and ease space requirements. Other innovations that limit the need of a 'cold chain' for supplies will greatly improve on-site sequencing in hot climates and remote communities that are prone to outbreaks of ebola virus disease.",

Thus, it is expected that sites of EBOV persistence that are not immune-privileged will be discovered. EBOV can be detected in breastmilk of female survivors of EVD and in various tissues, including the blood and liver, of laboratory mice that have been experimentally infected with EBOV and have partial immunity up to 150 days post-exposure 108, 109 . Persistence in sites that are not immune-privileged has also been recently reported for CCHFV 106 and LASV 110, 111 . Interestingly, CCHFV persists within granulomas of NHP survivors with latent tuberculosis 106 . LASV persists in the smooth muscle cells of blood vessels with vasculitis in both crab-eating macaque and domesticated guinea pig survivors 110, 111 , suggesting that a local altered immunological environment may sustain viral persistence.",

This example indicates the number of days after the initial presentation of symptoms at which an acutely infected male is sampled (day 4) and the day at which he recovers (day 20).

Multiple or even single nucleotide changes may permit EBOV to transverse the blood-brain barrier by directly infecting endothelial cells and microglia cells and establishing a persistent infection 91 .

Transcriptomics offer insight as to why certain factors, such as the source, viral load, and infectivity of EBOV or host genetics, contribute to the range of disease severity and survivorship in patients. Host 'immune gene signatures' in patients infected with EBOV/Mak have been associated with clinical prognosis 8, 118 . Indeed, data generated from 112 patients infected with EBOV/Mak (24 survivors and 88 fatal cases) revealed that interferon response-related genes and acute-phase responses were dysregulated in patients who did not survive 8 . However, natural killer cell populations were increased in EVD survivors, suggesting a crucial role for natural killer cells in controlling EBOV infection. Furthermore, low levels of inflammation and robust T cell responses with an upregulation of cytotoxic T lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA4) and programmed cell death 1 (PD1) expression in T cells also correlated with survival from EVD 118 . Additional transcriptomic studies focusing on the population dynamics of EBOV in infected humans and possibly in naive NHPs will complement earlier characterization of host responses to EVD and provide a greater understanding of the mechanisms of EVD pathogenesis and disease outcome. Bringing transcriptomics tools to the field, facilitated by our ability to perform genomic sequencing in outbreak areas, will allow the promises of precision medicine to be realized in an outbreak setting.",

Classical reverse genetics has focused on the virus rescue of filoviruses based on cloning a reference (that is, a consensus) filovirus sequence or using a replicating filovirus isolate to clone filovirus sequences 61, 62 . However, synthetic reverse genomics can rapidly rescue individual virus haplotypes or genotypes from a virus population in the absence of replicating isolates, using gene and genome synthesis based on sequence information alone. These rescued viruses can be used to evaluate the functional aspects of individual filovirus genome mutations. Thus, functional genomics can facilitate the rapid and precise functional characterization of a newly emerging filovirus or filovirus mutant. Given that natural filovirus isolates must be studied while fulfilling strict biosafety and biosecurity requirements that are frequently not available in areas of filovirus disease outbreaks, the availability of in-country and field-deployable sequencing platforms increases the ability of researchers to gather crucial information about the virus without the need to export biological specimens across national borders. To succeed, field sequencing needs to produce highly accurate finished filovirus genome sequences (for example, sequences that include the complete genomic leader and trailer regions of the virus) from a variety of sample sources 31, 42, 72 . Filoviruses rescued from synthetic reverse genetics systems can then be used to study host adaptation and attenuation as well as the efficacy of therapeutics 118-121 . The de novo generation of EBOV from the ongoing EVD outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (that is, of EBOV/\"Itu\") demonstrates the value of synthetic reverse genetics 9 (fig. 5 ). After the development of modular reverse genetic systems that are even more efficient than those available today, even high-throughput phenotypical characterizations of large numbers of minimally divergent filoviruses are likely to be possible even in the absence of a biological isolate.",

Rapid, high accuracy , complete genome sequences determined in-country are shared with out-of-country collaborators to evaluate key genomic and proteomic changes in Ebola virus (EBOV) that may affect the efficacy of available therapeutics (part a). For example, changes in the double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)-binding site of the EBOV polymerase cofactor viral protein 35 (VP35), a protein targeted by several therapeutics, can be identified from the sequencing data obtained for a new EBOV isolate. Changes in this region of VP35 may compromise the efficacy of treatments. Indeed, if two available therapeutic agents (hypothetical treatment A and hypothetical treatment B) target VP35, reverse genetic systems can produce replicative EBOVs de novo that contain the changes identified in VP35 (part b). These replicative EBOVs can then be used for the in vitro and in vivo therapeutic evaluation of both hypothetical treatments; data obtained using this approach can inform on which treatment is potentially more efficacious against the EBOV isolate causing the outbreak.",

Furthermore, the possibility that a more virulent or less treatable virus may evolve during such experiments and be accidently released is a concern, which is why Institutional Biosafety Committees are cautious in approving experiments aimed at creating such viruses.

Advances in large-scale and timely data generation encourage future genomic studies to go beyond consensus-level pathogen genome sequencing during an outbreak. For example, persistent infections in immune-privileged sites of survivors can be characterized using single-cell sequencing technologies. Additionally, an increased focus on host responses in an infected individual and the contribution of host genome characteristics to disease outcome and transmission would potentially further benefit the development of MCMs and improve the outbreak response. Complete pathogen-host genomic investigations could be applied to infected individuals, NHPs and known natural host reservoirs of filoviruses.

We hypothesize that the characterization of the EBOV population in individuals who did not benefit from treatment in the PALM trial might help elucidate the reasons for this failure. A clear demonstration of the power of genomics for this purpose was the investigation of two NHPs that succumbed to experimental EBOV exposure despite experimental treatment with MB-003, a cocktail of three mAbs. Two clusters of genomic mutations (a cluster of five non-synonymous changes in one animal and a cluster of four non-synonymous changes in the other) reduced the binding of the three mAbs to EBOV GP 1,2 ( fig. 6 ). Viral isolates obtained after MB-003 treatment recapitulated the observed 'escape' phenotype. The mutations, all located in the EBOV glycoprotein (GP) gene, abrogated antibody binding to GP 1,2 . Although this study was restricted in size, it highlights mechanisms by which EBOV can evade immuno therapies. First, adaptation to a selection pressure can occur rapidly. Second, methods to monitor the appearance and phasing of viral mutants that can escape immunotherapies are crucial. Third, with the use of reverse genetics systems, scientists can acquire pertinent information on the therapeutic efficacy of sequence-based MCMs during an ongoing outbreak of EVD 9 (fig. 5 ). For example, phenotypical changes resulting from clade-defining non-synonymous mutations (for example, alanine to histidine substitution at residue 547 in nucleoprotein or isoleucine to methionine substitution at residue 78 in viral protein 35, both in EBOV/\"Itu\") or positively selected non-synonymous mutations identified in the ongoing outbreak can be investigated.",

Following a zoonotic transmission event, sequencing the Ebola virus (EBOV) genome in real-time can help epidemiologists pinpoint the likely route of infection and of transmission during an outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD). A theoretical median-joining haplotype network of the Nord-Kivu/Sud-Kivu/Ituri Province EVD outbreak caused by EBOV/\"Itu\" in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (provinces are indicated on the map) provides different hypotheses that may explain person-to-person transmission events. A consistent number of genomic changes occurring in a specific window of time can indicate acute transmission events (that is, transmission via close contact with an individual with EVD, bottom left). The detection of transmission depends on diagnostics and sampling frequency. When sampling frequency is low , flare-up cases of EVD can appear with limited epidemiological data and with an unexpectedly large number of differences to earlier sampled haplotypes, which may point to undetected transmission networks (middle left; indicated by dashed lines).",

Therapeutic monoclonal antibodies, such as MB-003, neutralize EBOV, and infected patients subsequently recover. However, such treatment can also create a 'therapeutic bottleneck' in which intra-host diversity alters to select genotypes that only harbour the escape variant that continues to replicate in current and future hosts. b | The evolution of EBOV intra-host populations over time, pre-treatment and post-treatment, and the genomic bottleneck , can be visualized by estimating a phylogenetic tree (notable events along the tree are indicated by colourless circles).
