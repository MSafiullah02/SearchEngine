Our aims are first to evaluate Tunisian control policies for COVID-19 and secondly to understand the effect of different screening, quarantine and containment strategies and the rule of the asymptomatic patients on the spread of the virus in the Tunisian population. With this work, we show that Tunisian control policies are efficient in screening infected and asymptomatic individuals and that if containment and curfew are maintained the epidemic will be quickly contained.",

Since March 22, Tunisia has experienced a turning point and general health containment has begun. Tunisia's strategy of containment and targeted screening corresponds to the first WHO guidelines, the aim being to detect clusters by diagnosing only suspicious persons and then to trace the people who came into contact with the positive cases. This method is now showing its limitations. The mass screening carried out in some countries shows that asymptomatic patients or those who develop only a mild form of the disease may exist in significant numbers. So what is the rule of the asymptomatic patients on the spread of the virus in the Tunisian population and does containment and mass screening strategies are sufficient to control the spread of the virus in the Tunisian population?",

Infection is considered possible even when in contact with a person with mild symptoms. In fact, in the early stages of the disease, many people with the disease have only mild symptoms. It is, therefore, possible to contract COVID-19 through contact with a person who does not feel sick. Subsequently, in this work, we consider susceptible individuals, noted S, who are infected first go through a stage where they are infected but asymptomatic, noted As for unreported asymptomatic infectious. This stage appears to be particularly important in the spread of COVID-19. The individuals then develop symptoms and become symptomatic infectious, so either enter directly into a quarantine stage, noted Q, corresponds to reported symptomatic infectious individuals, or go through a moderate or severe infectious stage, noted I for unreported symptomatic infectious and then can go through the quarantine stage or not. Finally, the infection ends and the individuals are then immunized, denoted R or dead, denoted D.

During the period of curfew, the rate of infection \u03b11 is divided by 100. In Figure 4 (a), it can be seen that, for the chosen policy to maintains a 12-hour curfew for 100 days, the epidemiological peak in terms of the number of reported infected is reached after about 50 days with a value equal to 953. After the peak, we observe a slow decrease in the number of reported infected persons. On the other hand, in the more restrictive case of18 hours curfew, the peak would be reached more quickly after 27 days with a more rapid decrease.

We note that the simulated death curve overestimates the observed curve. This may be due to the mortality of unreported infected and therefore the surplus corresponds to unreported COVID-19 mortality, which makes the optimization of the model's variables for deaths imprecise. Moreover, the model predicts 228 deaths at the end of the epidemic in the current case (12 hours curfew). In the case where the curfew was 18 hours, the number of deaths would be 84.

With this work, we suggest that if containment and curfew are maintained, short-term projections could be more optimistic. The fact that the epidemic is quickly contained tends to show that the number of undeclared infected is low, which may suggest that our model is efficient for the evaluation of undeclared cases. In fact, we show that at the time of the epidemiological peak, the number of unreported infected persons constitutes at most 1/3 of the infected population. However, this will need to be confirmed by a field evaluation. Moreover, using Tunisian data, the optimization algorithm fixes the rate at which asymptomatic enter in 8 .

This expresses the good performance of the control policy of the Tunisian government. Indeed, in Tunisia, the control policy consists of an intense isolation campaign targeting sick individuals and their relatives. An effort of testing was carried out in a targeted manner, similar to snowball sampling. This approach enabled to have a major screening effort on infected and asymptomatic individuals. Finally, the model was successfully able to predict the time of the peak at the end of April.",
