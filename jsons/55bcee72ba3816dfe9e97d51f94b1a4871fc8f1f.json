However, as with all \"simple\" concepts, the devil is in the details. In this case, as somebody put it correctly in the three challenges afflicting all efforts in drug development: Delivery, Delivery, and Delivery. The first delivery aspect is to deposit an aerosol DNA bearing particles at the correct site in the lung, maintaining DNA integrity in lieu of shear forces necessary to produce aerosol droplet sizes suitable for inhalation. The second is to enable the uptake of DNA carrier systems by, if possible, the \"correct\" target cells. The last aspect is related to obtaining successful transfection, i.e., the successful expression and processing of the protein encoded in the DNA delivered. For all three of these stages, technologies have been developed over several decades.

In this case, the aerosolization was achieved by nebulization in what turned out to be a rather inefficient process. Application of aerosol had to be maintained for a total duration of 4-5 h, aerosolizing 6 mg of total DNA, of which only about 10 mg was finally deposited in the lung.

The degree of deacetylation of chitosan ranges from 40 to 98%. Different molecular weights (range of >100,000 to <2,000 Da) and viscosity grades are on the market. The primary amino function affords the possibility of easily altering the chemical modification of chitosan. The pK a value of this amino group was determined to be around 6.5 and does not vary significantly, even for different degrees of N-acetylation. Hence, chitosan is positively charged and soluble in acidic solutions, whereas unmodified chitosan is insoluble at physiological pH values (7.2-7.4). Chitosan has been considered to serve as a vector for gene delivery [60] due to biocompatibility and biodegradability [5] . A study dedicated to unravel the relationship between the structure of chitosan, i.e., its molecular weight and degree of deacetylation, its toxicity in vitro, and transfection efficiency after intratracheal administration in mice was performed recently [34] . It was shown that the percentage of deacetylation must be greater than 65% to achieve stable complexes with plasmid DNA, and achieve transgene expression.
