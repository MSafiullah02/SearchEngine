            "text": "Chloroquine (N\u2019-(7-chloro-4-quinolyl)-N,N-diethyl-pentane-1,4-diamine) was introduced more than 50 years ago for the prophylaxis and treatment of malaria. Except in special patient groups, the use of this inexpensive drug has gradually declined because of widespread resistance and the risk of mortality with overdoses. Chloroquine is now only used for malaria therapy in less developed countries or as a comparator for preclinical testing [1]. Although it has lost its preeminent position in malaria therapy, there is ample clinical evidence that chloroquine, and its derivative hydroxychloroquine, are effective for the treatment of lupus erythematosus, even during pregnancy. Chloroquine and its analogs have also been shown to modify cell differentiation and induce apoptosis in different cancer cell lines, giving hope that they will prove useful adjuncts to cancer chemotherapy [2]. As an autophagy inhibitor, chloroquine co-medication strongly enhanced in vitro tumor proliferation rate of docetaxel-loaded PEG-b-PLGA micelles [3], and it also played as a chemical sensitizer in doxorubicin and chloroquine coencapsulated liposomes [4]. Chloroquine gels have been developed as microbicides against HIV-1 infection and exerted a dose-dependent anti-HIV-1 activity in vitro [5]. Because of the potential for broader clinical use, there is likely to be ongoing development of chloroquine, and hence a need for a more rapid and efficient detection method for monitoring drug concentrations and preclinical research.",

            "text": "Although many analytical methods have been developed for the detection of chloroquine, most of these use expensive solid phase extraction (SPE) columns [7\u20139] or require time-consuming liquid\u2013liquid extractions (LLE) combined with extra preacidification operation [10\u201312] and/or prealkalization [10\u201313] procedure and then processed to an ultraviolet detector [7\u201313]. Brief summary of existing HPLC methods for the analysis of chloroquine since 2005 have been concluded and presented in Table 1. Singhal P et al. [14] published an LC\u2013MS/MS method for the detection of chloroquine in dog plasma for the first time. A structural analog instead of deuterated isotope internal standard (IS) and a simple protein precipitation by methanol were employed in this study. A traditional reversed-phase C18 (RP18) column was combined with regular mobile phase containing methanol\u2013water (75:25, v/v, 2.5 mM ammonium acetate, pH 4.6). The analysis method for chloroquine was quick, simple and sensitive. However, the absolute recovery of the one-step protein precipitation extraction was unusually rather low (\u02dc19%), which could be related to the matrix effect (not discussed in the assay) since chloroquine could be eluted along with matrixes in the form of salt in current column and mobile phase system. Generally, a traditional RP18 column was hard to reserve solar or basic compounds such as chloroquine. Most of the aforementioned methods used gradient elution [9,13] or relatively high proportion of aqueous phase [8,10\u201312] to retain the analytes. Still, these methods have obvious drawbacks, including a requirement of large injection volumes (up to 100 \u03bcl), long analysis times (especially combined with gradient elution), low sensitivity and limited selectivity, and therefore make it not suitable for fast and robust detection.",

            "text": "HILIC was first introduced by Alpert in 1990 [15] and is an attractive complementary tool for the analysis of small polar/ionic compounds. In addition to the hydrophobic interactions exploited in traditional RP chromatography, HILIC takes advantage of polar partitioning, hydrogen bonding, ion exchange interactions and weak electrostatic interactions, making it especially suitable for the retention and separation of polar compounds [16]. Compared with traditional RP columns, HILIC columns show better retention and more symmetrical peak shapes for basic and polar compounds. HILIC on polar stationary phases typically uses an organic-rich solvent containing 5\u201340% water as the mobile phase, which enhances MS sensitivity. Because of their versatility, HILIC separations have recently gained popularity for the analysis of polar drugs in complex sample matrices [17].",

In almost all published chromatography methods, strong ion-pairing reagents are added to the mobile phase in order to inhibit secondary retention [8,10,11,13], but these buffer salts could cause problems by crystallizing in the desolvation process during MS detection.

            "text": "Chloroquine has a strongly basic tertiary amine group (Figure 1, pKa 10.47 [20]) that readily interacts with silanol groups in the stationary phase of RPLC columns, probably resulting in secondary retention and consequent broad peak shapes (>1 min). The C18 column was the most frequently used columns in previously published research [7\u201310,12\u201314] and we have investigated the peak shape and response of several C18 columns in the optimization process. With additives of 5 mM ammonium formate and formic acid (0.015\u02dc0.1% formic acid) in mobile phase system consisting of acetonitrile and water, chloroquine did not reserve on an Eclipse Plus C18 column (5 \u03bcm, 100 \u00d7 4.6 mm, Agilent, USA) and the retention time remained almost unchanged (\u02dc1.8 min) with different proportion of acetonitrile ranged between 13 and 70%. The introduction of methanol-water system or acetonitrile-methanol-water system combined with the Eclipse Plus C18 column could not improve the retention behavior (\u02dc2.0 min). The basic compound of chloroquine seems to elute quickly as the form of salts in C18 column and C8 column with the appearance of H+ in mobile phase. The remove of H+ in mobile phase prolonged the reservation of chloroquine in Eclipse Plus C18 column (2.6 min), ZORBAX SB-C18 column (3.5 \u03bcm, 150 \u00d7 4.6 mm, Agilent, USA, retention time 3.3\u20133.5 min), Eclipse XDB-C18 column (5 \u03bcm, 150 \u00d7 4.6 mm, Agilent, USA, retention time \u02dc5.5 min) but exerted extremely broad peaks. Since chloroquine contains a highly polar tertiary amine that is likely to interact with silanol groups in the stationary phase of aforementioned RP columns, the deprivation of formic acid in mobile phase possibly related to broad peak shape in our research. Moreover, the wide asymmetrical shapes with long peak trailing, even at high percentages of acetonitrile, suggested the potential for long-term accumulation of analytes on these columns, possibly related to fast consume of columns and unexpected interfering signals in subsequent injections. In almost every published chromatography method, strong ion-pairing reagents were added to the mobile phase to inhibit secondary retention [8,10,11,13], which could cause problems by crystallization of nonvolatile salts in the desolvation process during MS detection. Thus we employed extra additives such as H+ to improve peak shape and enhance ionization efficiency in the analysis of chloroquine. We have compared chromatographic behaviors of chloroquine in mobile phase system containing different composition of methanol, acetonitrile, water and formic acid in Proshell 120 EC-C18 column (2.7 \u03bcm, 100 \u00d7 4.6 mm, Agilent, USA), ZORBAX SB-C18 column and Eclipse XDB-C18 column. Mobile phase consisting of acetonitrile-methanol-water-formic acid exerted narrow but slightly asymmetric peaks (half width about 0.5 min) of chloroquine and the analyte retained weakly in ZORBAX SB-C18 column (retention time 2.8 min) and Eclipse XDB-C18 column (retention time \u02dc3.3 min). A high proportion of organic solvent containing acetonitrile (\u02dc60%), methanol (\u02dc30%) and 0.1% formic acid (\u02dc10%) gave a comparatively well-shaped peak (half peak width 0.6 min, still broad) on the Agilent XDB column (retention time of 3.25 min) but this still did not meet our requirements. In conclusion, all analytes showed weak retention on these RP columns, regardless of solvent composition, confirming that traditional RP columns are not able to adequately retain chloroquine and that secondary retention was likely to have occurred between analytes and columns.",

This procedure, however, remains controversial since it irreversibly changes the character of the column and an alkaline mobile phase is needed to elute the analytes. Some researchers have inhibited secondary retention by increasing the ionic strength of the mobile phase by adding reagents such as perchloric acid [12], phosphoric acid [11] or phosphate buffer [13]. Although this method can be successful with some detection methods, it is not recommended for LC\u2013MS/MS because nonvolatile acids and buffer salts could crystallize during the desolvation procedure and damage the mass spectrometer. In the present study, we tried to optimize the mobile phase and column for LC\u2013MS/MS, and to identify conditions suitable for high-throughput detection. As the proportion of formic acid in the mobile phase was increased to 0.2%, the peak shapes showed some improvement since basic analytes tended to form salts at lower pH and showed less interaction with the stationary phase. High concentrations of formic acid could improve the peak shape, however, coelution of matrix and solvent interfere with detection of the analytes and we chose to use a more polar column to retain chloroquine and other basic analytes as salts. HILIC provides an alternative to HPLC for separating polar compound [17]. As with ion chromatography, for basic compounds such as chloroquine, HILIC gives good peak shapes (no tailing) and reasonable retention times compared with traditional RP columns [22]. Thus an HILIC Plus column (4.6 \u00d7 100 mm, 3.5 \u03bcm, Agilent) was chosen as separation column in our research.",

We employed a compromised flow rate of 0.5 ml/min here and tried to balance the retention and signal response by adjusting mobile phase component. The retention time of chloroquine on underivatized HILIC columns was longer when the mobile phase contained a higher proportion of organic solvent.

Gradient elution could realize better separation between analytes and interfering components whereas gradient elution usually requires balance time as long as half an hour in HILIC columns to obtain steady column pressure. A good balance of retention time, peak shape and matrix effect was achieved on an HILIC Plus column (3.5 \u03bcm, 100 \u00d7 4.6 mm) and current mobile phase consisting of methanol and water.",

We have developed a simple, highly sensitive and rapid method for the determination of chloroquine and used this method for high-throughput analysis of chloroquine in a PK study. Future works should however address issues such as flow rate, which in the present method is far less (0.5 ml/min) than the optimal flow rate in LC, to achieve balance retention time and efficient spray. We believe a postcolumn flow diverter could improve the situation in some degree. In addition, since only two pigs were included in the PK study, the sample size is too small for statistical analysis. As such an increased number of test animals are needed in subsequent research.",
