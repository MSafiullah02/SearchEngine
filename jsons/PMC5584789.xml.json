Singer (Singer, 1971) and popularized the following year (Singer & Nicolson, 1972). This \u201cfluid mosaic\u201d model proposes the free lateral diffusion of membrane proteins, which assume a long-scale random distribution in the two dimensional homogenous lipid fluid phase (see Figure 1(A)\n). One fundamental departure from this theory has been pivotal in shaping membrane research from the 1980s. Rather than being strewn randomly throughout a homogenous cell plasma membrane, proteins and lipids were proposed to be laterally heterogeneous, distributed in discrete patches. While researchers worldwide were embracing this view of cell membranes, to this day there remains deep division in the community: what are the driving forces behind plasma membrane heterogeneity?",

The ability of glycosphingolipids to self-associate and form discrete patches (reviewed in (Thompson & Tillack, 1985)), was then understood to also encompass protein distributions. Glycosphingolipid self-association in the Golgi could form patches with which membrane proteins would combine, and these mixtures could theoretically be transported to the apical membrane, mediating the sorting of sphingolipids and proteins in polarized epithelial cells (Simons and van Meer, 1988, Simons and Wandinger-Ness, 1990). Biochemical analyses appeared to support this model\u2014the association of (glycophosphatidyl inositol) GPI-anchored proteins along with glycosphingolipids in cell lysate insoluble detergent fractions was taken as evidence of lipid\u2013protein complexes in native membranes (Brown & Rose, 1992). In 1997 came a popular stating of one theory of lipid\u2013protein complexes in the cell plasma membrane: the lipid raft model (Simons & Ikonen, 1997).",

            "text": "This model postulates that particular subsets of lipids can self-organize, forming discrete patches within the plasma membrane (see Figure 1(B)), believed to be enriched in cholesterol, sphingolipids, and GPI-anchored proteins. The affinity of particular species of membrane proteins for these self-organizing lipids would determine their inclusion into these patches, and in doing so, determine the spatial patterning of proteins in the cell plasma membrane. Sphingolipid self-association would occur through weak interactions between their head groups. Furthermore, cholesterol helps fill gaps between lipid molecules to reduce water permeability (Finkelstein & Cass, 1967). The result (within the context of the model) is phase-separated liquid ordered (Lo) domains (i.e., \u201clipid rafts\u201d) enriched in sphingolipids, cholesterol, and GPI-anchored proteins, within a surrounding liquid disordered (Ld) fluid phase enriched in unsaturated lipids and other proteins (Simons & Ikonen, 1997). The revised raft model posits that nanoscale assemblies of sphingolipids, cholesterol, and proteins are fluctuating, but can be stabilized into larger platforms important for signaling, viral infection, and membrane trafficking (Simons & Gerl, 2010). While these assemblies are now theorized as being dynamic and of variable size, the basic concept remains that preferential interactions between cholesterol, sphingolipids, and specific proteins are the central mechanism driving local heterogeneity of the cell plasma membrane (Simons & Gerl, 2010).",

            "text": "The lipid raft model is closely linked to the idea that membrane lipids can self-segregate into domains. In particular, separation of bilayers into Lo and Ld phases was proposed to explain membrane lateral heterogeneity in biological membranes (Brown and London, 1997, Brown and London, 1998a, Brown and London, 1998b, Simons and Ikonen, 1997). This idea is based on observations that in the absence of membrane proteins, and depending on lipid composition, temperature, and buffer conditions, artificially created lipid bilayers can separate into coexisting Lo, Ld, and/or solid (gel) phases (Honerkamp-Smith et al., 2009, Tanford, 1978, Veatch et al., 2008, Veatch et al., 2006, Veatch and Keller, 2003a, Veatch and Keller, 2003b, Veatch and Keller, 2005, Veatch et al., 2004). Giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) (Angelova & Dimitrov, 1986), which are composed of a single bilayer, have been used extensively as a lipid model of liquid-ordered and liquid-disordered domains (Almeida et al., 2005, Bagatolli and Gratton, 1999, Bagatolli and Gratton, 2000, Bagatolli et al., 2000, Baumgart et al., 2007, Bagatolli et al., 2003, Baumgart et al., 2003, Baumgart et al., 2007, Dietrich et al., 2001, Korlach et al., 1999, Veatch, 2007, Veatch et al., 2008, Veatch et al., 2006, Veatch and Keller, 2005). GUVs made from a mixture of 1:1:1 (unsaturated lipid:saturated lipid:cholesterol), for example, can be made to phase separate at or close to physiological temperature. In general, due to differences in fatty acid chain order and/or length, saturated and unsaturated lipids will under many conditions separate into liquid and gel phases unless sufficient sterol (cholesterol) is present to prevent demixing (Stottrup et al., 2004, Veatch and Keller, 2002, Veatch and Keller, 2003a, Veatch and Keller, 2003b). Intriguingly, disruption of interactions between the cell plasma membrane and the cortical actin cytoskeleton in a process called \u201cblebbing\u201d (Keller et al., 2002, Tank et al., 1982) has been shown to lead to lipid phase separation in bilayers attached to or derived from cells (Baumgart et al., 2007, Veatch et al., 2008). Thus, cell membranes can be caused to phase separate, but whether phase separation occurs in unperturbed cell membranes, and if so, under what conditions and on what length scales, is still unclear.",

Proteins act as individual units each wrapped in a sphingolipid\u2013cholesterol lipid shell (see Figure 1(C)); these lipid shells do not form a distinct lipid phase, but are thought to be mobile units in the membrane. However, larger scale lipid domains (such as caveolae and \u201clipid rafts\u201d) are proposed to have a characteristic Lo phase, and proteins in lipid shells would have an affinity for these domains due to the compatibility of lipids in the shell and the Lo phase of the lipid domain. Interactions between shelled proteins and those already in lipid domains may influence their time of residence in the domain, as may ligand binding.",

The actin-based \u201cmembrane skeleton\u201d (MSK), or \u201cfence\u201d, creates compartments with diameters of 40\u2013300 nm (Kusumi et al., 2012), and various transmembrane proteins bound to these actin filaments act as \u201cpickets\u201d, which span the bilayer. Short-term diffusion of membrane lipids and non-MSK-bound membrane proteins can be confined within these compartments (see Figure 1(D)), with longer term trajectories punctuated by \u201chop\u201d movements between adjacent compartments (termed \u201chop diffusion\u201d) (Fujiwara et al., 2002, Kusumi et al., 2012). More recently, the model has been amended to include lipid rafts and protein oligomers, such that entire assemblies of proteins and lipids together may move within a compartment, but still be confined by the picket fence (Kusumi, et al., 2012).",

            "text": "Originally used to describe the distribution of GPI-anchored proteins in native cell membranes, this theory was developed to explain indirect observations which suggested these proteins existed either as monomers or in small, immobile, dense clusters, with an approximate average of four molecules per cluster (Sharma et al., 2004). These nanoclusters were reported to be transient and continually remodeling. However, they do not join or coalesce into larger domains, and the ratio of monomers (80%) to clusters (20%) is independent of total expression levels (Goswami et al., 2008). The authors propose the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane is abutted by a system of \u201cshort\u201d (although estimated as \u223c250 nm in length) actin filaments arranged in \u201casters\u201d, (see Figure 1(E)) which are formed by actin treadmilling and myosin contractility. Myosin contractility results in the barbed (or plus) ends of actin filaments pointing toward aster centers. In regions rich with myosin-bound actin filaments, peripheral actin filaments can be aligned with these other filaments, and pulled toward the most actin dense regions (the centers of asters). The authors posit that these forces are transmitted to (for example) GPI-anchored (exoplasmic leaflet) proteins, and proteins which bind F-actin, which are advected along with these filaments toward the centers of asters, forming nanoclusters at aster cores. Thus actin treadmilling and actin\u2013myosin contraction would drive dynamic nanoscale clustering of proteins at the cell surface (Gowrishankar, Ghosh, Saha, Mayor, & Rao, 2012). The theoretical basis for this model is further discussed below.",

We theorize that it is membrane-associated molecules which signal to induce local actin organization, and that these new actin platforms immediately adjacent to the membrane modulate the clustering of membrane proteins and/or lipids (Gudheti et al., 2013). This model does not discriminate between different hypotheses explaining the initial formation of membrane clusters (depicted in Figure 2(A)). We propose that when proteins are recruited into expanding membrane clusters they do so because of protein\u2013protein interactions (either through other cluster proteins or by binding to actin filaments), or because actin filaments affect their mobility through steric interactions. The recruitment of new molecules into the cluster subsequent to local actin remodeling must, in some cases at least, contain a method by which this recruitment is differential, thereby sometimes favoring recruitment of \u201clike\u201d proteins into preexisting membrane clusters. This model is further discussed in Section 3.1.",

In many ways and for many years, membrane research has been prevented from achieving this goal. The lack of adequate methodology has resulted in only indirect measurements being used, which has often provided insufficient evidence to discriminate between competing models. As membrane domains are widely theorized as being submicron and dynamic, their visualization with light or electron microscopy (EM) has remained indefinite. In the absence of direct images of membrane domains, the above models of membrane organization have been incompletely tested. Many experimental approaches are controversial in their ability to distinguish membrane domains. For example, cold low density detergent-insoluble fractions of lysed cell membranes have been extensively used as a determinant of lipid rafts (from (Brown & Rose, 1992) to (Recktenwald et al., 2015)), however their representation of domains in native cell membranes is tenuous and yet to be verified (Edidin, 2003, Kraft, 2013, Lichtenberg et al., 2005).",

            "text": "Relying on cholesterol dependence to define raft-associated processes is also problematic. The cholesterol dependence of membrane domains is often tested by perturbing cholesterol, which is known to alter phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate (PIP2) availability, and in turn the organization of the actin cytoskeleton (Kwik et al., 2003), as well as other fundamental cellular processes such as endocytosis (Borroni et al., 2007). Additionally, perturbing cholesterol with cyclodextrins can result in phospholipid redistribution, and these drugs can interact with membrane proteins (Zidovetzki & Levitan, 2007). Additional hypotheses of cholesterol-mediated scaffolding of signaling proteins can also explain cholesterol dependence in lipid raft-free models of protein organization (see review in (Kraft, 2013)). Furthermore, cholesterol was found not to be enriched in membrane clusters of sphingolipids in fibroblast cells (Frisz, Klitzing, et al., 2013), and even in GUVs made from ternary lipid mixtures, the concentration of cholesterol was only modestly enriched in the Lo phase compared to the Ld phase (Veatch et al., 2006). Thus, despite its involvement in an abundance of biological functions and diseases (Maxfield and Menon, 2006, Maxfield and Tabas, 2005, Michel and Bakovic, 2007, Pichler and Riezman, 2004, Rojo et al., 2006, Saini et al., 2004, Song et al., 2014, Tabas, 2002), the roles of cholesterol in membrane lateral organization require further clarification. While the importance of cholesterol and other lipids has been heavily investigated in the field of membrane organization models, clearly membrane and cytoskeletal proteins also play a crucial role in cell membrane biology.",

For example, a recent revision of the fluid mosaic membrane model envisages that actin fences, lipid rafts, and lipid shells (among other factors) can be congruous and all contribute to the segregation of integral membrane proteins (Nicolson, 2014). However, some aspects of these models are mutually exclusive: actin filaments in the \u201cactive composite\u201d model are proposed as being \u223c250 nm long (Gowrishankar, et al., 2012), which would presumably result in asters with diameters \u223c500nm, too large to be bounded by actin membrane compartments of \u2264300 nm diameter proposed by the \u201cpicket fence\u201d model (Kusumi et al., 2012). Moreover, some tenets of these models are directly competing. For example, the \u201clipid shell\u201d model hypothesizes that GPI-anchored protein clustering results from Lo phase coalescence between lipid shells and lipid domains (Anderson & Jacobson, 2002). Conversely, the \u201cactive composite\u201d model hypothesizes that GPI-anchored protein clustering results from these proteins advecting with the movement of actin filaments toward the centers of actin asters (Gowrishankar et al., 2012). These are two very different mechanisms, each proposed to explain the same phenomenon, namely the clustering of GPI-anchored proteins.",

If transmembrane proteins bound to F-actin are advected along with treadmilling actin filaments, and these filaments have their barbed ends pointing toward the center of an aster, then the motion of the transmembrane proteins will be toward the periphery of the aster, rather than toward the center (i.e., the treadmilling of actin will push the actin-bound transmembrane protein toward the actin filament pointed end, which is at the aster periphery).

Studies of protein dynamics are highly informative, but considering the importance of the cytoskeleton, methods which can image multiple species (e.g., cytoskeletal and integral membrane proteins) simultaneously are highly desirable. Single particle tracking (SPT) can fulfill this role when combined with another microscopy method, or when adapted to allow multiple species to be tracked simultaneously (Weigel, Simon, Tamkun, & Krapf, 2011). This approach has already provided valuable information on the apparent restriction of Fc\u03b5RI receptors by the actin cytoskeleton (Andrews et al., 2008), and this technique is a great tool for gathering precise information on dynamics of very small numbers of molecules. However, SPT tends to be used to quantify motions of individual particles, rather than specifically for imaging. The use of homo-F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer (homo-FRET) in describing cell surface distributions of proteins is also a powerful and dynamic method (Gowrishankar et al., 2012, Sharma et al., 2004), yet is limited in length scales to less than roughly twice the F\u00f6rster radius (i.e., <10 nm) and to diffraction-limited scales (i.e., >200 nm), blocking direct observation of the size and shape of membrane domains.",

For practical purposes, the numerical aperture of a lens is limited to \u223c1.45\u20131.65 and using the mean of the visible wavelengths of light (\u03bb = 550 nm), the value of r0 is \u223c200\u2013230 nm.

In STED, the fluorescence of molecules is interrupted (outcompeted) by stimulated emission so that the emission of fluorescent molecules not at the precise center of the focal volume can be quenched and the effective focal volume size reduced to a few tens of nanometers, or even smaller, in either two or three dimensions (Hein et al., 2008, Meyer et al., 2008).

These probes, often fluorescent proteins or dyes, are characterized by their ability to exhibit changes to their fluorescent properties, such as transitions from an inactive dark state to an active fluorescent state, when illuminated with a particular wavelength of light (often in the blue or ultraviolet wavelength range). Two lasers are typically used in combination, an activation laser to convert inactive (nonfluorescent) molecules to an activated state and a readout laser to drive the activated molecules to emit light. Since the activation of the fluorescent probes is a stochastic process, with probability proportional to the activation laser intensity, using low activation laser intensity can cause a small subset of the total population of fluorescent molecules in the sample to be activated at any given time. This subset of activated molecules will fluoresce when excited with a readout laser and then photobleach or return to a dark state. With low density of active molecules, there is a high probability that each fluorescent molecule will be resolvable from the others. When this occurs, each molecule can be localized by finding the centroid of the image or by fitting the image with an appropriate function, such as a two-dimensional Gaussian. The process of activation, readout, and photobleaching of the fluorescent probes can be repeated until there are no more fluorescent molecules in the sample or until a desired number of molecules has been recorded (Betzig et al., 2006, Hess et al., 2006, Rust et al., 2006).",

FPALM and PALM initially used fluorescent proteins (Betzig et al., 2006, Hess et al., 2006) while STORM initially used antibodies conjugated to organic dyes to label structures of interest (Rust et al., 2006). The intracellular introduction of antibodies generally requires cell membranes to be permeabilized in some manner, a consideration when STORM is used for live cell studies. However, organic dyes have the advantage of being relatively bright and photostable, especially in the presence of an oxygen scavenging system. This allows for resampling of the same fluorophore several times before photobleaching. While this increases sampling density, and potentially resolution, this resampling can result in overcounting of the number of localized molecules in the sample. Fluorescent proteins, by comparison, sometimes emit fewer photons before photobleaching. Such characteristics reduce the rates of overcounting, but fewer detected photons per molecule can also limit localization precision and, in the presence of background, the number of molecules identified. However, fluorescent proteins are expressed by the cell, eliminating the need to introduce large antibodies through the cell membrane, and they also do not require use of reducing agents in the imaging buffer. Since these localization methods rely on constructing an image from many localized point sources, labeling density and specific probe photophysics tend to be the most limiting factors.",

SOFI can be applied to many fluorescence imaging modalities provided that the fluorescent label used has two or more distinguishable states (for example, a bright and dark state), and that each molecule switches stochastically and independently of the others. To achieve enhanced resolution, a movie of a fluorescently labeled sample is acquired, and an n-th order autocumulant is calculated, effectively filtering the acquisition such that only highly correlated fluctuations remain. This results in an image with greatly reduced background and a resolution that is the square root of 2 better than the diffraction limited case. Alternatively, cross-cumulants may be used instead for even larger increases in resolution (Dertinger, Colyer, Vogel, Enderlein, & Weiss, 2010). SOFI can be used in 3D imaging applications (Dertinger, Xu, Naini, Vogel, & Weiss, 2012), with living samples (Geissbuehler et al., 2014), and has been demonstrated with organic dyes (Dertinger, Heilemann, Vogel, Sauer, & Weiss, 2010).",

In uPAINT, highly specific fluorescent ligands are added to the sample via solution just before imaging. The ligands bind to target proteins of interest and, with an appropriately chosen concentration, are sparse enough to be localized. Excited fluorophores will eventually photobleach but are stochastically replenished by ligands from solution. An oblique laser illumination profile is used to excite the fluorophores in order to limit the focal volume, reduce background, and prevent bleaching of out of focus molecules. uPAINT is well suited to tracking single molecules for many time steps, and multiple dye molecules can be bound to a single ligand to further increase tracking duration (up to tens of seconds). uPAINT has been used to examine up to two species simultaneously (Winckler et al., 2013). Typical localization precisions are within the range of 40\u201350 nm (Giannone et al., 2010). Since the fluorescent labels are added exogenously to the sample, careful optimization of ligand concentration, laser intensity, and imaging rate is essential.",

The K-function quantifies the number of objects (e.g., imaged proteins or lipids) of a given type found within a circle of specified radius from each other object of the same type (or a different type for co-distribution measurements) and normalizes the amplitude by the overall density such that an amplitude of zero corresponds to a random distribution (Ripley, 1977). The PCF quantifies the number of probes at a given distance from each other molecule, normalizes by the area of each ring and the average molecular density, and averages over all molecules, such that an amplitude of 1 corresponds to random. Typically, these tests are performed over a range of radii in order to determine whether there is any clustering of the probes and if so, to elucidate properties such as mean cluster radii or mean cluster density (Gudheti et al., 2013, Hess et al., 2005, Philimonenko et al., 2000, Plowman et al., 2005). There are other tests to measure spatial heterogeneity such as the Getis G statistic (Getis & Ord, 1992), which includes different normalizations and weighing parameters dependent on molecular spatial position. These differences result in increased sensitivities to certain cluster parameters (Itano et al., 2014).",

Single-linkage cluster analysis (Sneath, 1957) defines all molecules within a user-defined distance of any other molecule in the set to be within the same cluster. This type of algorithm is useful because it precisely defines the set of molecules within each cluster, and thus the localized coordinates of those molecules can be quantified directly (Bar-On et al., 2012, Gudheti et al., 2013). The nearest neighbor distance distribution can also be used to determine the local density of the clustered probes. This information allows for comparison of cells that have been treated to disrupt or enhance clustering (Hess et al., 2005) or for comparison of nonclustered probes in different regions of the plasma membrane (Stryer, 1978, Zacharias et al., 2002). Additionally, an angular histogram (the angle between a molecule and its two nearest neighbors) reveals any preferential orientation of probes within the cluster. Orientational order can result from hexatic phases or interactions with other cellular components which may induce ordering of the proteins, such as cytoskeletal components (Hess et al., 2005).",

            "text": "We instead briefly discuss some regulatory influences of the anionic membrane phospholipid, phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2). By binding to PIP2, ABPs can be targeted to membranes (e.g., spectrin; see review in (Boguslawska, Machnicka, Hryniewicz-Jankowska, & Czogalla, 2014), ezrin/radixin/moesin proteins and talin (Barret et al., 2000, Hao et al., 2009, Jayasundar et al., 2012, Saltel et al., 2009) and annexins (Hayes et al., 2009, Martin-Belmonte and Mostov, 2007)). PIP2 binding is also considered a necessary step in the activation of many ABPs (Wu et al., 2014), such as ezrin/radixin/moesin proteins (Yonemura, Matsui, & Tsukita, 2002), and Arp2/3 (via WASP) (Higgs & Pollard, 2000). However, PIP2 binding may also inhibit the cross-linking of actin by filamin (Furuhashi, Inagaki, Hatano, Fukami, & Takenawa, 1992), the bundling of actin by \u03b1-actinin (Fraley et al., 2003) and the severing of actin by cofilin (van Rheenen et al., 2007). Additionally, PIP2 may be in return regulated by ABPs (e.g., talin (Di Paolo et al., 2002)). PIP2 also regulates signaling cascades upstream of ABPs and actin remodeling, and helps coordinate actin organization in a variety of contexts (see reviews by (Rocha-Perugini et al., 2014, Saarikangas et al., 2010, Sun et al., 2013)). See Section 3.4.2 for further discussion of PIP2 imaging.",

By understanding the spatial and functional relationships between ABPs, actin, and the membrane, we can better understand exactly how cell systems are able to coordinate a staggering array of varied and distinct molecular processes at the membrane. Before assessing the future opportunities in this field, we first summarize the techniques which have led us to this point.",

Kenworthy et al. used FRAP very effectively to distinguish between membrane models with and without cytoskeletal interactions (Kenworthy et al., 2004), and discovered that the slow diffusion of the cholera toxin subunit B (CTxB) is due to confinement by the actin cytoskeleton (Day & Kenworthy, 2012). FRAP and SPT have been used together to identify anomalous diffusion of clustered membrane receptors, suggesting interactions with the cytoskeleton (Feder, Brust-Mascher, Slattery, Baird, & Webb, 1996). FRET has been used to investigate the coclustering of putative raft and nonraft markers (Chichili & Rodgers, 2007) and Goswami et al. were able to quantify an association between GPI-anchored protein clustering and cortical actin remodeling using homo-FRET (Goswami et al., 2008). However, neither FRET nor FRAP visualize (subdiffraction sized) cluster geometry directly, so results must be interpreted in terms of some kind of model, and FRET microscopy does not directly access clustering on length scales between \u223c10 and 250 nm.",

FCS uses the fluctuations in a fluorescence signal to measure molecular concentration, diffusion coefficient or transport rate, and molecular transitions between bright and dark states (Hess, Huang, Heikal, & Webb, 2002). FCS of lipid probes in cell membranes demonstrated anomalous diffusion (Schwille, Korlach, & Webb, 1999) consistent with cytoskeletal interactions or nanodomains. FCS measurements of diffusion as a function of observation volume size (Wawrezinieck, Rigneault, Marguet, & Lenne, 2005) have been very effectively used to quantify GPI-anchored protein clustering, and results also suggest that cytoskeletal interactions mediate membrane lateral organization (Lenne et al., 2006). Lasserre et al. used similar FCS measurements to quantify protein nanodomains related to activation of signaling pathways related to Akt and phosphoinositide-3 kinase, which can regulate the actin cytoskeleton (Lasserre et al., 2008). A super-resolution version of FCS which uses STED to confine the observation volume (Eggeling et al., 2009) has demonstrated that sphingolipids and GPI-anchored proteins are transiently trapped in small cholesterol-dependent complexes of <20 nm in size, while phosphoglycerolipids are not.",

Dual color FPALM has shown that clusters of influenza hemagglutinin (HA) can either be colocalized with, or completely exclude, the ABP cofilin (Gudheti et al., 2013). Sequential dual color PALM/dSTORM imaging has revealed a tight spatial association between the post synaptic density and Arp2/3, which is functionally reliant on the Rho GTPase Rac (Chazeau et al., 2014). Dual-color PALM has shown that actin and GPI-anchored proteins (which have extensively been used to demonstrate aspects of various models of membrane organization (see Section 1.1)), cluster on the nanoscale without appreciable colocalization, until antibody cross-linking stimulates formation of GPI-anchored protein clusters many microns in size which do associate with actin (Sengupta et al., 2011). Dual-color STED imaging of PC12 membranes has shown that mesoscale membrane clusters contain many species of protein which are further spatially organized within a single cluster, and these clusters exclude, and are strikingly bordered by, actin and spectrin (Saka et al., 2014).",

            "text": "The insights into membrane organization afforded by super-resolution microscopy, along with observations from decades of membrane research provide the basis for our cluster feedback model (see Section 1.1), whereby the relationship between (1) membrane proteins and lipids (including PIP2), and (2) actin and ABPs is bidirectional. The differential regulation of ABPs by membrane-associated molecules can induce the local formation and reorganization of actin filaments. These actin filaments can then work to locally alter the distribution and diffusion of membrane molecules, creating clusters of proteins and lipids in membrane domains. This model builds on ideas published in a range of membrane protein clustering contexts (Chichili and Rodgers, 2009, Gowrishankar et al., 2012, Gudheti et al., 2013, Jaumouille et al., 2014, Viola and Gupta, 2007, van Zanten et al., 2009). Experimental evidence for this model has come from observations that (1) increasing actin stability can increase coclustering of membrane proteins (e.g., (Chichili and Rodgers, 2007, Gudheti et al., 2013)), (2) ABPs are differentially localized with respect to clusters of membrane proteins (Chazeau et al., 2014, Gudheti et al., 2013, Saka et al., 2014), and (3) altering ABP expression can be sufficient to modulate membrane protein mobility (Pore et al., 2013) and clustering (e.g., (Alvarez-Guaita et al., 2014, Chazeau et al., 2014). Feedback has been demonstrated by, for example, work showing that Fc\u03b3 receptor activation can influence actin polymerization, which in turn affects Fc\u03b3 receptor mobility (Jaumouille et al., 2014), and in the T-cell activated remodeling of F-actin, which in turn mediates the organization of plasma-membrane bound signaling proteins (see review in (Kumari, Curado, Mayya, & Dustin, 2014)). Upstream regulators of ABPs have also been measured with respect to membrane protein organization, such as the elegant dual color NSOM study demonstrating that ligand binding of integrins induces clustering of, and colocalization with, GPI-anchored proteins (van Zanten et al., 2009). We hope to see more studies using super-resolution microscopy to directly image actin, membrane proteins, and the ABPs themselves, so that we may further test hypotheses of membrane protein\u2014actin/ABP feedback predicted by the cluster feedback model.",

Similarly, actin can contribute to many processes which alter spatial organization of membrane proteins (e.g., endo- and exocytosis). Single species imaging of membrane proteins with or without ABPS (or actin disrupting drugs) can test for effects on membrane protein distribution, but cannot easily determine how. Better understanding of mechanisms can come from simultaneous imaging of the membrane protein and the ABP (and/or actin) being investigated. Research into other membrane platforms, such as focal adhesions, has been aided by super-resolution microscopy elucidating (for example) movement of single talin molecules with respect to \u03b2-integrins (Rossier et al., 2012) and the organization in three dimensions of multiple ABPs with respect to the membrane (Kanchanawong et al., 2010).",

The development of photoactivatable lipid tags (e.g. Mizuno et al., 2011) has already allowed exciting super-resolution imaging of membrane lipids (Abe et al., 2012, Honigmann et al., 2013), yet many opportunities for multichannel lipid/actin/membrane imaging remain relatively unexplored. Studies which visualize and analyze the three-dimensional organization of the membrane and actin cytoskeleton will continue to be extremely fruitful. We are now in a golden age of microscopy, where dreams of visualizing the precise dynamic steps of cellular function, including the previously enigmatic process of organizing membrane domains and the associated actin cytoskeleton, are now becoming reality. Studies combining super-resolution techniques will allow us to finally see, in three dimensions and real time, how many different players dance together to organize cellular membranes.",

            "text": "Even though direct optical imaging of membrane domains with diffraction limited techniques is not always possible, many properties of viral assembly and function can be uncovered through indirect imaging methods. FRET microscopy has reported the association between viral proteins and putative lipid raft markers (Engel et al., 2010), and FRET has been quite useful in quantifying clustering of many membrane proteins on length scales <10 nm (Karpova et al., 2003, Kenworthy, 2001, Kenworthy, 2005, Kenworthy and Edidin, 1998, Kenworthy et al., 2000). FRAP (Elson, Schlessinger, Koppel, Axelrod, & Webb, 1976) has yielded insight into mechanisms of diffusion of viral membrane proteins at the cell membrane (Kenworthy et al., 2004), and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) has revealed how lipid phase changes as a function of temperature help protect viral stability (Polozov, Bezrukov, Gawrisch, & Zimmerberg, 2008). However, FRET is insensitive to length scales from \u223c10 to 200 nm, NMR does not provide an image, and FRAP does not give direct information about spatial organization below the diffraction limit. Using super-resolution imaging, investigators have been able to directly quantify shapes, sizes, and densities of membrane protein distributions, as well as the degree of spatial overlap between different species of proteins at the nanoscale (Gould et al., 2008, Gudheti et al., 2013, Gunewardene et al., 2011, Hess et al., 2007, Shroff et al., 2007). These capabilities have allowed researchers to answer previously inaccessible questions about viral assembly, viral protein trafficking, and viral interactions with host cell components, which help build our understanding of the infection process, and have the potential to reveal new anti-viral drug targets.",

            "text": "The influenza virus is responsible for tens of thousands of deaths annually. Influenza can use host cell proteins to aid in infection, and mass spectrometry has shown that a number of host cell proteins are also preferentially incorporated into influenza virus released from infected cells (Shaw, Stone, Colangelo, Gulcicek, & Palese, 2008), leading to the question of how these associations occur. Some answers may be found with the influenza membrane protein hemagglutinin (HA), which is crucial in many steps of viral infection. HA binds sialic-acid containing cell surface receptors (Skehel & Wiley, 2000); HA catalyzes membrane fusion necessary for viral entry (Biswas et al., 2008, Chernomordik et al., 1998, Skehel and Wiley, 2000, Skehel and Wiley, 2002, Wiley and Skehel, 1987); and clustering of HA in the viral membrane is crucial for fusion to be accomplished (Bentz, 2000, Chernomordik et al., 1998, Chernomordik et al., 1997, Kozlov and Chernomordik, 1998, Kumar et al., 2001, Takeda et al., 2003). HA assembles with other viral components before budding (Nayak, Hui, & Barman, 2004), and in the late 1990s, biochemical experiments were able to show that the influenza virus buds from areas of the host membrane where viral components including HA and certain cell lipids are concentrated (Scheiffele et al., 1999, Scheiffele et al., 1997). HA dynamics have been investigated with SPT, which helped elucidate the HA-dependent mechanism by which viral RNA traverses the nuclear envelope (Babcock et al., 2004, Lakadamyali et al., 2003), and FRAP experiments measured the diffusion coefficient of HA \u223c0.1 \u03bcm2/s, and suggested an immobile fraction (\u223c25%) of HA (Kenworthy et al., 2004). While these experiments have greatly helped shape our understanding of influenza infection, they have not fully clarified the nanoscale organization of viral and host cell components during infection.",

Super-resolution microscopy has also been used to determine the spatial distribution of the host cell protein CD81 (tetraspanin), which is recruited to assembling influenza viruses, and is concentrated at the growing tip and budding neck of progeny viruses (He et al., 2013). CD81 can control the progression of membrane protein distributions in, for example, immunological synapse formation (Rocha-Perugini et al., 2013), and form complexes with a number of signaling proteins and other master regulators such as the integrins (Berditchevski, 2001). Tetraspanin redistribution by influenza may be one method by which the virus is able to reorganize other host cell membrane proteins on the surface of budding virions.",

            "text": "One other host cell protein which is greatly exploited by influenza, and viruses in general, is actin (Radtke, Dohner, & Sodeik, 2006). While it was shown that HA clusters (which are necessary precursors of viral budding (Scheiffele et al., 1997)) can persist over timescales of at least tens of seconds (Hess et al., 2007), high-speed FPALM showed that fluctuations in area, perimeter, and shape of these clusters can occur on timescales as short as 0.1 s (Nelson et al., 2014) leading to the question of how clusters are able to persist. Multicolor FPALM imaging in live cells has shown that HA mobility decreases with increased cortical actin density. Along with the discovery of two distinct populations of HA, one with low (non-zero) mobility and confined motion on 100\u2013200 nm length scales (Gudheti et al., 2013), these findings suggest that local actin is influencing the dynamics of this membrane protein. Colocalization of HA clusters with actin clusters and the increase in HA cluster size upon treatment with actin-stabilizing jasplakinolide treatment do not seem consistent with a picket-fence description (Gudheti et al., 2013). Moreover, the intriguing nanoscale differential anti- and colocalization of HA and ABPs, including cofilin (which is strikingly excluded from some HA clusters, yet strongly colocalizes with others), suggests the relationship is more involved than HA molecules simply being confined between actin fences (Gudheti et al., 2013). Rather, these insights made possible by super-resolution microscopy suggest a dynamic \u201ccluster feedback\u201d between membrane HA and the underlying actin cytoskeleton (see Section 1.1 and Figure 2). Understanding these HA organizing mechanisms could be vital in identifying novel antiviral drug treatments, and understanding the HA/actin/ABP interplay may illuminate cellular processes which are used to organize the distributions of many other membrane proteins.",

Understanding of the molecular dynamics involved in HIV infection and replication is critical for developing future medical treatments for infected individuals, as well as for preventing infection. Formation of the HIV immature capsid (and in turn budding, release, and maturation of the virus) depends on formation of a polyprotein assembly of the HIV protein group-specific antigen (Gag) (Lingappa, Reed, Tanaka, Chutiraka, & Robinson, 2014). Live cell sptPALM was used to compare the dynamic behaviors of Gag and the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) G protein (Manley et al., 2008). This allowed researchers to build dense \u201ctrajectory maps\u201d of many different proteins to help understand the dynamic behavior of individual proteins, and entire populations and assemblies, in the plasma membrane. While the distributions and mobility of Gag and VSV-G proteins differed greatly, they were both found to be consistent with results obtained through diffraction-limited techniques (Jouvenet et al., 2006, Kenworthy et al., 2004). Using STORM, researchers revealed that Gag recruits and corrals the HIV viral envelope protein (Env) into large immobile clusters on the plasma membrane, in a process dependent on the Env cytoplasmic tail (Roy, Chan, Lambele, & Thali, 2013). STED has also elucidated this relationship, revealing that clustering of Env on viral envelopes changed as a function of viral maturity, and that this clustering required the Gag-interacting Env tail (Chojnacki et al., 2012). Using sptPALM and PALM images, micro-RNA overexpression was shown to reduce Gag mobility, and also reduce Gag cluster size and density (Chen et al., 2014), which could in turn affect the clustering of HIV-1 Env and overall infectivity of the virus.",

            "text": "Ground-breaking progress in our understanding of virus infection has already emerged from the use of super-resolution microscopy. In particular, the manipulation of host membrane protein organization by viruses has been shown, at the nanoscale, to be imperative for some steps in viral infection. These microscopy methods could also be employed to help understand currently unknown mechanisms in past and rising health threats such as pox viruses (e.g., smallpox and vaccinia), coronaviruses (e.g., SARS), and filoviruses (e.g., Ebola and Marburg viruses). There are at least six membrane proteins known to be associated with the currently unclear process of virion formation in the vaccinia virus (Liu, Cooper, Howley, & Hayball, 2014). In filoviruses, the proteins responsible for viral assembly and virion production have been identified, but the mechanisms of interaction with the host cell remain unclear (Stahelin, 2014). Understanding the interplay between host and viral membrane protein organization at the nanoscale with super-resolution microscopy will undoubtedly continue to rapidly improve our understanding of virus infection, and so aid in the development of targeted and efficacious antiviral therapies. Super-resolution microscopy has also been used to study the defenses mounted by cells upon viral infection (see Section 3.4.1 for more detail on immune cells). FPALM imaging of zebrafish cells showed that snakehead rhabdovirus (SHRV) infection resulted in downregulated caveolin expression, which in turn dispersed the clustering of a zebrafish type I interferon receptor (IFN-R) homolog, the clustering of which was crucial for the innate immune response (Gabor et al., 2013). Exciting recent developments now show that FPALM can be used in vivo to image membrane structures within living zebrafish (Gabor, Kim, Kim, & Hess, 2015), suggesting that changes in membrane organization during viral infection, and many other possibilities, can now be investigated in vivo.",

While these experiments provide invaluable information about the viral life cycle, they explore only a part of the full story. More research into the organization and dynamics of the virion envelope during binding, entry, and uncoating, could provide additional insights and help identify new antiviral drug targets. As many entire virions can be smaller than the diffraction limit, questions relating to the organization of host cell and viral proteins within the virion itself require the ability to image nanoscale structure. Super-resolution can see at the nano- and virus-scale, and we can now resolve host cell proteins (and lipids) in living cells as they are commandeered by the virus. These capabilities are well suited for understanding infection, so we can better develop methods to combat it. We look forward to seeing in real time at the nanoscale exactly how viruses use, abuse, and steal our membranes and associated proteins for their own infective purposes.",

STED imaging indicated nucleoids were of a uniform size and shape and were themselves clustered (Kukat et al., 2011); however, PALM imaging indicated a great variability in nucleoid sizes and shapes, and suggested physical interactions between nucleoids and the IMM (Brown, Tkachuk, et al., 2011).

Importantly, this allowed the imaging of a distinct time series in receptor organization. Prior to antigen addition, IgE-bound Fc\u03b5RI receptors are uniformly distributed throughout the membrane. Within 2 minutes of antigen addition, the mobility of receptors slows dramatically and the receptors themselves are laterally confined. It is not until 5 minutes post antigen addition that receptors organize into \u223c70 nm clusters, which are too small to resolve using conventional microscopy. Furthermore, the mobility of single receptors after antigen addition was highly dependent on the surrounding receptor density, even before strong clustering occurred. Single receptors reversibly associated with small and slowly moving receptor clusters soon after antigen addition, and before calcium mobilization, suggesting initial signaling promoted these molecular associations. Antigen-mediated clustering could be reversed; addition of an antigen-competitive monovalent ligand restored the uniform distribution of receptors in nonantigen-treated cells. This elegant and robust study is a fine example of the profound biological insight which can be gained from carefully quantified super-resolution data.",

            "text": "One long-standing question has faced immunity research for years: how can NK cells pass a cannonball through the eye of a needle? NK cells (and cytotoxic T cells) can directly eliminate virus-infected or tumor cells through specialized secretory lysosomes known as lytic granules (Bryceson et al., 2011, Lieberman, 2003), with diameters around 250 nm (Brown, Oddos, et al., 2011). Confocal studies suggested granules were secreted through a large (many microns in diameter) central clearance in an otherwise hyperdense actin barrier (Orange et al., 2003). Recent super-resolution imaging of NK cells showed actin filament accumulation at the IS upon NK cell stimulation, which is not centrally cleared as previously thought ((SIM; Brown, Oddos, et al., 2011; STED; Rak et al., 2011)). Rather, the holes in the actin mesh (only present upon cell activation) are only large enough to accommodate a single granule (Brown et al., 2012, Brown et al., 2011, Rak et al., 2011). Two-color STED showed the close spatial association of actin and granules adjacent to the IS (Mace & Orange, 2012a), and that the actin ABP coronin aided actin hole formation, facilitating granule secretion through the otherwise dense actin cortex (Mace & Orange, 2014). So, the lytic granule cannonball can pass through, not because of a large barrier clearance, but because the eye of the dense actin mesh needle locally expands to accommodate it. This fundamental change in ideas is due to the insight made possible by imaging advances: \u201cThe use of super-resolution imaging was critical to the identification of the granule-sized clearances formed in response to activating signal\u201d (Mace & Orange, 2012b).",

ZAP-70 and Lck mediate the phosphorylation of the scaffolding proteins linker for activation of T-cells (LAT) and SH2 domain-containing leukocyte protein-76 (SLP76) (for review see (Le Floc'h & Huse, 2015)). These multimolecular signaling complexes (along with other associated effectors and adaptors) can further group into microclusters, and these complexes and microclusters drive signal amplification and underpin T-cell activation (for review see (Sherman et al., 2013)).

In resting T-cells, plasma membrane-bound TCR and LAT were shown with single color PALM to precluster into independent \u201cprotein islands.\u201d Following T-cell activation, these islands appeared to concatenate, forming TCR and LAT microclusters, respectively (Lillemeier et al., 2010). Further use of dual color PALM also indicated that TCR and ZAP-70 resided in separate clusters which mixed upon T-cell activation (Sherman et al., 2011). Surprisingly, the same study indicated that clusters of LAT and TCR decreased in their spatial overlap upon T-cell activation (Sherman et al., 2011). Similarly, dual-color PALM imaging of ZAP-70 and another of its substrates, SLP-76, indicated that ZAP-70 and SLP-76 clusters segregated as a function of time after activation (Hsu & Baumgart, 2011).

Dual-color dSTORM and PALM imaging suggested that T-cell activation involved docking of subsynaptic vesicles and subsequent localized delivery of LAT molecules to plasma membrane activation sites, forming new, immobile LAT clusters (Williamson et al., 2011). Dual-color PALM showed SLP-76 accumulation at the rims of LAT clusters in activated T-cells (Sherman et al., 2011), and dual color dSTORM-TIRF imaging showed that upon T-cell activation, phosphorylated (p)LAT formed vesicular fusion-dependent \u201csignaling nanoterritories,\u201d elongated pLAT nanoclusters adjacent to (within 20 nm), but spatially segregated from clusters of phosphorylated SLP-76 (Soares et al., 2013). Conversely, pLAT that was preclustered in the plasma membranes of resting T-cells (in morphologically distinct circular nanoclusters) rarely associated with pSLP76 (Soares et al., 2013). These results suggest that two different populations of LAT exist; with (1) activation induced fusion of vesicular LAT to the plasma membrane predominantly contributing to signaling complexes, and (2) preexisting plasma membrane-bound LAT clusters remaining relatively inert with respect to signal transduction.",

Imaging by tracking single molecules with STORM has shown that individual BCRs, and BCR microclusters, each exhibit reduced mobility in ezrin deficient cells (Pore et al., 2013). Imaging with dSTORM showed for the first time that BCR isotypes IgM and IgG, and the co-factor CD19, are differentially assembled into preformed clusters on the naive B-cell plasma membrane (Mattila et al., 2013). Antigen activation induces a local coalescence of nanoclusters of BCR and the cofactor CD19, with the membrane spanning molecular organizer CD81 (tetraspanin) determining reorganization. Mattila et al. propose that CD19 is sequestered from BCR nanoclusters by CD81, and B-cell activation induces actin remodeling which allows CD19 to converge with BCRs and elicit cell signaling (Mattila et al., 2013). The alterations in the clustering of these proteins occur at the nanoscale, without alterations to their global distributions. These studies highlight the insights allowed by super-resolution in understanding immune processes which are otherwise invisible (see review by (Grove, 2014)).",

Mammals produce seven different types of phosphoinositide, each of which is found in a different domain of the membrane, and each of which is differentiated by the location of the phosphorylation of the inositol ring (Di Paolo & De Camilli, 2006). Phosphoinositides are involved in, and regulate, an immense number of cellular events, including cell signaling, membrane transport and regulation, cytokinesis, and organelle distinction (Di Paolo & De Camilli, 2006). They can do this by directly binding to proteins, by activating proteins upstream of structural change, and by mediating a number of signaling pathways. One particularly important phosphoinositide is phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-biphosphate (PIP2), which is also one of the more prevalent subspecies (Liu & Bankaitis, 2010). Of particular interest in membrane organization research, PIP2 has the potential to be a master regulator, as it can function to remodel the actin cytoskeleton in many different ways (see Section 3.1 for more detail), and may be a functional conduit between membrane proteins, lipids, and membrane-associated actin. Though these lipids are essential for cellular functionality, data suggest that PIP2-mediated processes are altered by nanoscale spatial distributions not resolvable by conventional microscopy. Super-resolution microscopy has allowed nanoscale investigation to begin.",

Ideally, probes would emit very large numbers of photons (i.e., >105) before switching to a dark state or bleaching, they would have minimal blinking on millisecond and microsecond timescales (as this can lead to erroneously increased estimates of molecule number), and probes would not disrupt biological function. Of course, increased numbers of detected photons can in principle improve localization precision, although many other factors are involved at length scales below 20 nm, such as localization errors due to emission dipole orientation effects (Enderlein, Toprak, & Selvin, 2006), camera pixel heterogeneities (Pertsinidis, Zhang, & Chu, 2010), and sample/stage drift (Mlodzianoski et al., 2011). However, to gain substantial increases in imaging speeds, using probes with high peak emission rates (i.e., 106 photons detected per molecule per second), may be the most important (and perhaps overlooked) property. While organic dyes can emit very large numbers of photons, they are still limited in emission rate by blinking, flicker, and saturation. Furthermore, very little data on maximum emission rate per molecule is available\u2014most studies focus on number of detected photons, measured extinction coefficient and quantum yield, which do not address emission rate at saturation. To optimize use and choice of probes, there is considerable need for systematic photophysical studies of probes used for localization microscopy, such as those being carried out by Markus Sauer (van de Linde & Sauer, 2014), Carlos Bustamante (Lee, Shin, Lee, & Bustamante, 2012), Dominique Bourgeois (Avilov et al., 2014), and others.",

Development of increasingly efficient algorithms for larger numbers of spatially overlapping PSFs is of great interest, and can enable live cell imaging with speeds fivefold faster or more, especially when coupled to use of labels with high emission rates (Huang et al., 2013). In addition, high-speed cameras capable of imaging the action are also crucial, and recent developments in sCMOS and EMCCD sensor technology and electronics for readout have helped the field tremendously. We look forward to the ongoing technological advances in sensor development which allow for faster acquisition, and so facilitate greater temporal resolution.",

As all interactions between light and a biological sample can potentially cause disruption of biological function, super-resolution techniques (including both STED and localization-based methods) seem to be particularly susceptible; the high intensities often used are expected to cause more damage, and the short length scales typically of interest are also more likely to manifest changes (however subtle). Notwithstanding, there is very little consensus in the field related to the intensity or dose thresholds for photodamage. Currently it seems that each group has their own method for testing for possible photodamage, and there seems not to be any standardization, making generalizations extremely difficult. Thus there is considerable need for systematic exploration of this crucial issue. Once better understanding of the most common damage mechanisms has been established, methods can be developed to mitigate photodamage while still allowing nanoscale structures to be imaged.",

Current work in the field is helping to overcome these challenges, so it is likely that in the near future, localization microscopy will become used more widely for quantification of molecular numbers, information which is not directly accessible by a number of other techniques. Moreover, discovery and engineering of new methods to tag cellular molecules (e.g., reductions in the size of tags, whether fluorescent proteins or antibodies) will bring us closer to the prospect of imaging with minimal disruption to cellular function.",

Simultaneous multicolor imaging can be limited by the spectra of probes used to tag them. New tags (e.g., new species of photoactivatable proteins, or newly engineered organic dyes) are emerging which are less overlapping in their emission spectra. Also emerging are new ways to reliably identify tagged species when there may be spectral overlap (including ratiometric analyses, but also the development of color recognition in sensor systems). Together these advances bring us toward simultaneous super-resolution imaging of five or more species in living cells.

While this can be useful, there is much more to be learned from studying the three-dimensional structure of the membrane and its interactions with the actin cytoskeleton. Not only can this strategy be helpful in discerning differences between models of how membrane proteins are regulated in their spatial distributions, but also it can allow a fuller understanding of the richness of cellular functions and interactions which are possible in such systems. For example, considering the actin cytoskeleton as its native three-dimensional self allows for ABP coupling between actin, membrane proteins, lipids, lateral organization, and three-dimensional membrane topology. That is to say, both proteins and lipids are clearly important. Likewise, as many cellular organelles have three-dimensional structures and complex membrane topologies, it is clear that we must approach such systems three-dimensionally, while also further investigating how lateral organization (i.e., domains) can occur within the membrane. Thus, there are a number of challenges to solve as we endeavor to understand membranes. Just a decade ago, many of these challenges seemed insurmountable.
