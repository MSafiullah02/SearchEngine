            "text": "Antigen-presenting cells (APCs) of the innate immune system include macrophages (M\u00d8s), dendritic cells (DCs) and B cells. These cells capture and process foreign antigens for presentation to T cells enabling efficient host defence and immunological memory. B cells are well equipped to recognize and take up a wide variety of antigens due to the presence of somatically variable surface immunoglobulins. DCs and M\u00d8s, however, rely on germ-line encoded cell-surface receptors to distinguish between harmless self antigens and pathogen-derived antigens against which immune responses are desirable [1]. Over the past number of years our understanding of APC cell surface receptor biology has increased greatly. In addition to the well-characterised opsonic receptors for \u03b3-immunoglobulins (Fc\u03b3Rs) [2] and the complement receptors, such as complement receptor 3 (CR3) 3., 4., APCs of the myeloid lineage express an array of non-opsonic pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), which have evolved to recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) [5], including lipids, carbohydrates and proteins. In addition to this, APCs express receptors such as those of the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily 6., 7., 8., which mediate interactions with host cells to regulate immune responses.",

Although the TLRs play a central role in alerting APCs to the presence of pathogenic material it is not clear whether they are capable of capturing and taking up antigens [10\u2022], and this function appears to be met by other families of PRRs, most notably the C-type lectin receptors (CLRs) [11\u2022] and the scavenger receptors [12].",

CLRs also bind soluble self antigens, leading to immune tolerance and maintenance of endogenous glycoprotein homeostasis [13]. Furthermore, co-operation between TLRs and CLRs has been demonstrated and it seems that appropriate immune responses rely on the interaction of many different antigen sensing and sampling mechanisms [14].",

It was subsequently also shown to bind ICAM-2 on vascular endothelial cells, regulating DC migration [27]; both of these interactions occur through N-linked high mannose structures (typically consisting of between five and nine terminal mannose units). Mannose-dependent interactions also account for the ability of DC-SIGN to bind HIV [28] and a plethora of other pathogens, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Candida albicans, Helicobacter pylori and Schistosoma mansoni\n[29\u2022\u2022]. DC-SIGN discriminates between ligands not only on the basis of primary mannose groups, but also via secondary binding sites, which accommodate carbohydrates with distinctive geometry conferred by linkage to the primary monosaccharide moiety [30\u2022\u2022]. This probably explains the differences in ligand affinity between DC-SIGN and other apparent mannose-specific CLRs such as MR. Further specificity can also be achieved through multimerisation of the receptor at the cell surface [31]; indeed, tetramerisation of DC-SIGN facilitates high-affinity binding to high mannose oligosaccharides, such as those found on HIV [32\u2022].",

            "text": "Despite the obvious ability of DC-SIGN to recognize pathogens, the contribution of this receptor to host defence is unclear. As ligands for DC-SIGN also bind many other CLRs, specific monoclonal antibodies have been used to assess the fate of ligands targeted through individual receptors [33]. Such studies indicate that DC-SIGN targets antigens to late endosomal/lysosomal compartments for degradation and presentation to T cells. Paradoxically, it has been reported that a range of viruses, including HIV [34], hepatitis C virus 35., 36., the recently discovered coronavirus responsible for severe acute respiratory disease [37\u2022], and dengue virus 38., 39. can exploit DC-SIGN to protect virions from the normal pathways of lysosomal degradation and presentation to T cells. In the case of HIV, this interaction allows efficient transinfection of CD4+ T cells in secondary lymphoid organs [34]. More recently, however, Moris and colleagues [40] have challenged this view by showing that, in DCs and DC-SIGN transfected cells, the majority of HIV virions are rapidly degraded in endosomal or lysosomal compartments. Although this pathway normally leads to MHC-II-restricted presentation of epitopes, DC-SIGN-dependent MHC-I-restricted presentation was also evident. It is probable that not all virions are targeted in this way and a small proportion might escape to the cytoplasm or other non-endosomal/non-lysosomal compartments allowing subsequent transinfection of T cells. In addition, as DCs and M\u00d8s express many different mannose-specific CLRs, it is likely that virus uptake by these cells proceeds through multiple routes [41].",

Dectin-1 contains an immunotyrosine activatory motif (ITAM) within its cytoplasmic tail that is required for interactions with the TLR2 signalling pathway. Independently of TLR2, the ITAM is also required for cytoskeletal rearrangements triggered through dectin-1 preceding phagocytosis [64]. The precise signalling pathways initiated following tyrosine phosphorylation within the ITAM are not well understood. Although it was initially predicted that they might be similar to those seen with other ITAM-bearing receptors, such as the Fc receptors for IgG, a new study suggests that this is not the case and it is likely that dectin-1 responses act through a novel signalling pathway [64].",

            "text": "Interestingly, the intracellular fate of ligands captured through dectin-1 appears to be associated with their size [64]. Receptors such as MR rapidly recycle between the cell surface and lysosomal vesicles where ligands are released and degraded allowing MR to traffic back to the cell surface [20]. Other receptors such as Fc\u03b3R undergo de novo synthesis and are degraded in lysosomes together with their cargo [65]. Dectin-1, however, has features of both types of trafficking depending on the ligand used. When stimulated with smaller ligands such as laminarin, the receptor recycles to the cell surface but when larger ligands such as glucan phosphate or zymosan are used cell surface dectin-1 expression is reduced [20]. The mechanism of this trafficking is unclear at present but might have significant implications for our understanding of the biological effects of dectin-1 ligands in vivo as well as our understanding of antigen handling by the innate immune system.",

These receptors permit interactions with pathogens and endogenous soluble proteins as well as cell-surface ligands expressed by T cells and anatomically distinct endothelial cells, such as those found in secondary lymphoid organs. Langerin (a), a type-II C-type lectin expressed exclusively by Langerhans cells, binds mannose-type ligands and delivers material to unique Birbeck granules. DC-SIGN (b), another type-II C-type lectin is expressed by both macrophages and DCs. It interacts with endogenous molecules, such as ICAM-2, on endothelial cells as well as ICAM-3 on T-cells, mediating intercellular adhesion. In addition, DC-SIGN binds pathogen-associated mannose-type carbohydrates found on viruses, bacteria and fungi. Multimerisation of DC-SIGN and other such receptors at the cell surface might facilitate high-affinity ligand binding. BDCA-2 (c), is a C-type lectin expressed exclusively by human plasmacytoid DCs and appears to play a role in regulating type-I IFN production by these cells, although ligands for this receptor are yet to be identified. Dectin-2, a murine C-type lectin which demonstrates sequence similarity with BDCA-2 has a role in regulating UV-induced tolerance. This might be due to interaction with an as yet unidentified ligand on CD4+CD25+ T cells. Mannose receptor (MR) (d), is a multi-functional type I receptor expressed by macrophages, DCs and endothelial cells. CRD 4 is the primary ligand-binding site for both endogenous and pathogen-derived mannosylated ligands. The CRD mediates interactions with sulphated carbohydrates found on endogenous ligands such as sialoadhesin and CD45. MR also mediates intercellular adhesion and can bind lymphocyte-expressed L-selectin. Dectin-1 (e), is a non-classical C-type lectin found primarily on macrophages, DCs and neutrophils. It binds \u03b2-glucans in a Ca2+-independent manner. Ligand-induced signalling mediated by the cytoplasmic ITAM motif leads to phagocytosis and pro-inflammatory cytokine production in co-operation with TLR-2.",
