In addition, birds become susceptible to secondary pathogens, such as Escherichia coli (King and Cavanagh, 1991).",

Due to their ease and correlation with serotype, genotype tests (dot blots, DNA probes, DNA sequencing, serotype-specific RT-PCR, and RT-PCR/RFLP) have become widely used. Although the genotyping tests are rapid, room for improvement remains. In particular, elimination of post RT-PCR manipulations (gel electrophoresis, gel purification of DNA, restriction enzyme analysis, sequencing, etc.) would decrease the cost and overall assay time. Recent technological advances in the field of real-time nucleic acid amplification could be used to negate the need for post RT-PCR manipulations.",

Basically, RNA is extracted from a biological sample, incubated in the presence of a complementary chimeric oligonucleotide (5\u2032-DNA:2\u2032-O-Me-RNA-3\u2032), and cleaved by RNase H at the site of hybridization due to the formation of a DNA:RNA duplex (Bogdanova et al., 1995, Yu and Steitz, 1997). The total amount of RNA in the sample (uncleaved) and the amount of residual RNA following specific hybridization of the chimeric oligonucleotide and cleavage by RNase H is quantified by RRT-PCR. Then, the ratio of total RNA to cleaved RNA is calculated to determine the specificity of the chimeric oligonucleotide for the target RNA. We describe the use of SRRQ to differentiate IBV isolates representing five different serotypes.",
