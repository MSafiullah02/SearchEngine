A further timeline is used to classify all infections diagnosed in the hospital setting as nosocomial, with onset 48 hours after the patient is admitted to the hospital, and community-acquired infection, with onset at the time of admission or within 48 hours of admission. The latter definitions of infection may be artificial in the setting of CTTX as some infections, although related to healthcare and immunosuppression, may not occur within the established time-line of nosocomial infections. To fully appreciate the impact of the potential source of infection, we propose using the categories of nosocomial (after 48 hours of hospitalization) and community-acquired (prior to 48 hours of hospitalization) with the added category of community-acquired \u201ctransplant-related\u201d infections. This category would include infections by pathogens acquired by the CTTX patient prior to time of transplantation and that are clearly related to the immunocompromised state of the CTTX patient after transplantation that may increase the risk for specific bacterial pathogens that are not common in the community. These pathogens may be related to the donor or the recipient via pre-transplant colonization of the respiratory or gastrointestinal (GI) tract and can be therefore regarded as \u201ctransplant-related\u201d in this setting.12, 13 It is also to be noted that community-acquired pneumonia may be transplant-related if caused by organisms that are typically associated with transplants (e.g., fungal, multidrug-resistant or atypical bacteria).",

Frequent use of empirical anti-bacterial agents prior to specimen collection and the possibility of concurrent allograft rejection make the use of standard guidelines, as presented by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) for healthcare-associated infections (HCAIs), difficult to apply.2 In addition, some microbiologic diagnostic procedures may not be routinely practiced at many transplant centers and this may limit the employment of diagnostic criteria for infections that require quantification of bacterial colony-forming units per milliliter in the bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples. This methodology has not been validated in the immunocompromised host and is not standardized across institutions. Further, the thresholds proposed may underestimate the episodes of bacterial pneumonia in the CTTX population,20 where early empirical intervention with anti-microbial agents prior to obtaining the samples with suspected pneumonia is common practice. Presence of endobronchial stents in lung transplant recipients further complicates the picture in defining various clinical syndromes.",

A distinction should be made between non-invasive and invasive ventilation.2Aspiration pneumonia should be considered if the criteria are fulfilled for pneumonia (Table 1a). The cause of this type of pneumonia should be noted.3Multiple or concurrent episodes of post-transplant pneumonia may occur. To determine a new episode in a single patient, resolution of the initial infection must be determined by clinical, laboratory or histologic evidence. The isolation of a new pathogen alone is not indicative of a new episode of pneumonia. In contrast, a second pneumonia may develop in a patient after single lung transplantation. Here, the contralateral lung may develop an \u201cindependent\u201d pneumonia by another organism.4Sputum samples are frequently contaminated with airway colonizers (e.g., coagulase-negative Staphylococcus and Enterococcus spp), and therefore must be interpreted cautiously.5The interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) serum test is not recommended for diagnosis of acute tracheobronchitis disease, although a positive result is an indication of latent disease or recent infection and a useful screening test if baseline IGRA testing is performed prior to transplantation.25\n6Episodes of airway colonization are not recorded as infections.7Histologic representation of chronic graft rejection may not impact the diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia. Therefore, it is not included as criteria for pneumonia definition.26\n8The definition of \u201cpossible pneumonia\u201d category allows recording of pneumonia after lung transplantation even if required diagnostic procedures were missed, which may occur with prior anti-microbial treatment or delay in diagnostic testing, etc.9In lung transplant recipients, it is desirable to always give additional information if evidence of acute graft rejection exists either by clinical or by histopathologic diagnosis.10It is possible to have concurrent infections\u2014pneumonia with sinusitis or anastomotic tracheobronchitis.11Quantification of organisms in BAL is not considered essential for the diagnosis of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).27 However, invasive diagnostics may help withdraw anti-bacterial therapy, which may prevent further emergence of multi-resistant organisms in future.28, 29\n12The category of bacterial tracheobronchitis is classified into probable and proven categories. They can only be diagnosed in the presence of bronchoscopic findings. We have refrained from using the term microbiogically negative tracheobrochitis as it requires more evidence.13Endobronchial stent\u2013associated tracheobronchitis or bronchial anastomotic infections, both fungal and bacterial, are categorized as probable (Table 2).\n14No attempt is made to redefine atypical mycobacterial infections or pulmonary tracheobronchitis in lung transplant recipients and the use of existing definitions from European and North American societies are encouraged until further data emerge.30, 31, 32, 33\n15It is preferable to document the use of antibiotics in patients with pneumonia at the time of culture data collection.\n",

Further, with the use of molecular diagnostic and deep gene sequencing techniques, novel respiratory viral pathogens, such as human metapneumovirus, human coronaviruses and bocavirus, have been identified.43, 44 These discoveries have led to the expansion of the repertoire of respiratory viral pathogens and infections to be considered in any research of the impact of respiratory viral infections after CTTX. Characteristic histopathologic changes on lung biopsy specimens when these viruses are present have not been identified by these methods, such as with CMV and herpes simplex virus (HSV), but efforts continue, demonstrating the multidisciplinary approach to the accurate diagnosis of infection in this population.

Asymptomatic viral shedding in the upper oropharynx by CMV is distinguished from active CMV disease in these definitions and will assist in further assessing the role of CMV in CTTX. In early studies, the recovery of CMV by viral culture in the absence of tissue diagnosis was considered diagnostic of CMV pneumonitis.49, 50 However, further studies did not suggest that CMV recovery from BAL was predictive of subsequent CMV pneumonitis.51, 52, 53, 54, 55 With the advent of sophisticated molecular diagnostics, the recovery of CMV from BAL became more specific and reproducible compared with conventional or shell-vial culture,53 and additional studies suggested that CMV viral load in BAL fluid may be correlated with invasive CMV pneumonia.2, 56, 57 However, the utility of CMV viral load in BAL in predicting CMV pneumonitis remains uncertain in studies to date.",

Diagnosis of fungal infection based on histology alone may not be as accurate due to the concomitant presence of acute or chronic rejection in these individuals.24 Similarly, it is not only the unique clinical syndromes of fungal infection that set them apart from the other immunocompromised hosts, but the diagnostic utility of non-invasive testing also is different. Serum galactomannan has markedly lower sensitivity (30%) in lung transplant recipients as compared with other immunocompromised hosts.63, 64 Similarly, the sensitivity of other serologic markers such as serum cryptococcal or coccidiodal antigen, histoplasma urine antigen may be variable.65, 66, 67, 68 The use of BAL for GM has resulted in sensitivities of >66% when a 0.58 or 0.66 optical density (OD) index was used as a cutoff.69, 70 A higher cutoff (1.5 OD) yielded better results in one study.71 We suggest the use of BAL GM in the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis (IA) in lung transplant recipients. Similarly, fungal PCRs, especially from BAL specimens, are more likely to be less sensitive for the diagnosis of disease than BAL specimens from other immunocompromised hosts owing to colonization of the airways. Cell wall components of fungi have also been used in the diagnosis of fungal infections. Currently available \u03b2-glucan is non-specific and is negative in cases of cryptococcosis and zygomycosis.72 In a recent study of lung transplant recipients, serum \u03b2-D-glucan sensitivity was reported to be 93%, whereas specificity was merely 71%.73\n",

            "text": "The Mycoses Study Group (MSG) and the European Organization for Research and Treatment (EORTC) recently updated the definitions of fungal infections in immunocompromised hosts.3 These definitions represent an excellent attempt to standardize the reporting of fungal infections in studies. However, they fail to address the unique nature of clinical syndromes in lung transplant recipients, particularly colonization, tracheobronchitis and bronchial anastomotic infections.8, 74, 75 Also, the radiologic presentation of invasive mycoses in cardiothoracic organ transplant recipients may not conform to the classical \u201chalo sign\u201d presentation in neutropenic or stem cell transplant recipients (Figure 2).76 Moreover, the definitions do not account for the differences in the sensitivity of serologic tests, particularly galactomannan in lung transplant recipients.69, 70, 77, 78 In addition, the category of possible fungal infection might not be applicable in lung transplant recipients owing to a multitude of possible diagnoses in these patients. The American Society of Transplantation (AST) also put forward a set of definitions to be used in the study of these infections in SOT recipients.1 The AST definitions do take into account some unique clinical syndromes in lung transplant recipients but lack the detailed description of clinical syndromes. Reported studies of fungal infections in lung transplant recipients used diverse definitions.14, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83 The following sets of definitions are proposed to standardize the reporting of fungal infections, particularly mold and yeast (endemic mycoses, Candida spp and Cryptococcus spp) infections in CTTX recipients, especially among general and lung transplant recipients. The isolation of non-pathogenic molds or other non-pathogenic fungi in BAL or sputum is not believed to satisfy the microbiologic criteria for the diagnosis of probable invasive fungal infections in these patients without histologic confirmation (Tables 4a\nand 4b). However, these definitions of fungal infections do not address Pneumocystis jiroveci infection, which has previously been adequately defined for use in CTTX.1\n",
