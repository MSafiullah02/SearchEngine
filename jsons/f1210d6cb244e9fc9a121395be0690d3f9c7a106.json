We describe the clinical course of 4 patients with Down syndrome during an outbreak of COVID-19. In all four patients, disease course was severe, warranting hospital care in three patients, with fatal outcome in one patient. Another patient receives supportive care in our institution. Our case series is the first report on probable increased risk of life-threatening disease course of COVID-19 in patients with Down syndrome. Proper surveillance, the adherence of social distancing, and the use of personal protective equipment will be essential in reducing morbidity and mortality in our patients.",
