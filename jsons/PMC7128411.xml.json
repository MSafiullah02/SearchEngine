Until recently, this latter option was the official choice of European decision-makers, to the point that the ECID concept (a centralised structure with walls) seemed to be politically dead.5 However, minds have changed after the bioterrorism and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) episodes.6, 7 The ECDC is aiming in the right direction, in the sense that it will be a centre with walls. However, it is too timid a project to fulfil its mission. Planned staff will be 70 in 2007, which is totally inadequate: the National Center for Infectious Diseases (NCID) at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) employs more than 1500, and even the French Institut National de Veille Sanitaire (INVS) is staffed by 250. The ECDC could be worse than nothing if it becomes an excuse for European decision makers to take no further action.",

First, surveillance and training activities will be based on the most recent scientific advances. Conversely, surveillance activities keep researchers in constant contact with the practical problems of the field. Second, critical size. Not only is the overall European investment effort in infectious diseases research far lower than the US one, it is also poorly coordinated and jeopardised by rivalries between nations. Only by combining our efforts can we match the US investment. For this vital field, we must reproduce what was done successfully for space research (European Space Agency, ESA) and particle physics (European Centre for Particle Physics, CERN). If we do not, European research in infectious diseases will remain",
