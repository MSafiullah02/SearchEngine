In general, quantitative and semiquantitative approaches can be applied to tissues to produce scores that enhance the rigor of data. \u201cQuantitative\u201d scores are derived from measuring tissue parameters often using manual techniques or by using specialized software to analyze digital images3,16,17 and yield a discrete numeric value on a continuous scale (eg, 0.3, 1.25, 4.5, etc.). In contrast, \u201csemiquantitative\u201d scores are assigned by an observer based on predefined morphologic criteria,3 and these whole number scores are, by definition, less precise than quantitative scores because they approximate relative changes. Semiquantitative scoring can be applied to macroscopic and microscopic tissue changes, allowing generation of robust data that are amenable to statistical analysis and evaluation of experimental groups. The goals of this paper are to introduce investigators to key ideas in reproducible semiquantitative scoring of tissues and guide them in finding additional resources for more detailed discussions and examples. For the remainder of this paper, \u201cscores\u201d and \u201cscoring\u201d will refer, unless otherwise specified, to semiquantitative methods.",

While annotated images and descriptive text may show apparent differences between groups, semiquantitative scores can provide a comprehensive overview of tissue changes for group comparisons. Lastly, semiquantitative data can be used to guide, corroborate, and validate observations or data obtained from other assays.",

Here, the goal is to evaluate the safety of the material being tested (ie, hazard identification and risk assessment) rather than to assess potential treatment efficacy. To support future clinical trials, all toxicity studies must be performed according to guidance documents from various regulatory agencies, such as the Food and Drug Administration. Additionally, the usage of consistent diagnostic terminology for each organ system in rodents and large animals is strongly recommended.9,21 Collaboration with experienced toxicologists and toxicological pathologists is highly encouraged before investigators plan these types of studies to ensure the current regulatory guidelines are followed. Unless specified, the remainder of the paper will focus on foundational concepts for semiquantitative scoring emphasizing nontoxicologic translational studies (Table 1).\n",

It can be helpful to revisit proper techniques for tissue collection as well as the different options available for fixation and storage because tissue handling variables can influence staining quality.3,4,27,30 Staining techniques can also vary in consistency as a function of stain choice and by staining protocol. For example, the planning phase for a hypothetical experiment involving viral-induced inflammation in the lungs of a mouse should address whether there is sufficient tissue for multiple tests (eg, bronchoalveolar lavage, paraffin, and OCT embedded tissues, PCR, microarray, protein quantification, and viral culture). Novice investigators might make several invalid assumptions (eg, homogenous virus distribution in lungs, bronchoalveolar lavage collection does not affect other analyses, murine lung size will allow for ample tissue sampling, etc.) that can lead to incomplete and/or skewed data.4 Early consultation with all key collaborators (especially pathologists) at the time of experimental design will ensure all needs are accounted for (eg, appropriate amount and type of tissue allocations) to prevent oversights.",

For example, tissue harvest from a large cohort of animals will likely produce a wide range of times from onset of the experimental day until necropsy. If animal in one treatment group were necropsied early, before starting on the other group, tissue parameters such as liver glycogen stores (especially in fasted animals) could be affected and create artifactual group-specific bias. Randomization of all the groups (animals and their tissues) can mitigate bias introduced by the experimental procedures. Other examples of variables that could render a study nonrandomized include differential housing of subjects (single vs group) or subject/sample processing order. Any variable that is not randomized across treatment groups has the potential to confound the data.",

Masking (also known as blinding) is a method to keep the observer from knowing the treatment groups when assigning tissue scores. Experts at every level (even pathologists!) are at risk of having their judgment subliminally influenced by information cues from the study. Masking significantly reduces this possibility. There are several methods to mask observers to the experimental groups, each with advantages and disadvantages that have been previously reviewed.3,4,40 Briefly, comprehensive masking prevents the observer from knowing any details about the study design, treatments, or grouping of samples at initial examination. This approach may seem unbiased and even useful upon first glance, but in reality can easily lead to false negatives and skewed interpretations. An alternative approach to comprehensive masking is group masking. Here, the study design, treatments, and goals are all transparent to the observer; however, the samples are each assigned into de-identified groups, so that the observer does not know which group had specific treatments. A final example is that of postexamination masking. In this approach, full transparency and access are allowed to all study-related information and slides. This is an important step, especially in new or poorly characterized models, to avoid missing subtle or unexpected treatment-related changes. Once the decision is made to score the tissues, the slides are masked to the observer and scores assigned. Masking should be a standard component that is defined in the methodology of all studies that use semiquantitative scoring. For each of these approaches, the observer should evaluate the scores and tissues after scoring in a nonmasked fashion to give confidence in the scoring system and interpretation of the results.",

First, the range of levels is recommended to be about 4 to 5; fewer than this decreases sensitivity to detect group differences and more than this reduces repeatability3,5,6,43 Second, each progressive level should have well-defined descriptors (such as the percentage of tissue affected, as in the example above). Descriptors that are vague and subjective, such as 0 is normal, 1 is mild, 2 is moderate, and 3 is severe, should be avoided or include additional information to clearly discern each level. Score descriptors in an ordinal system can be defined by multiple lesion parameters (eg, inflammation, proliferation, necrosis), but in these situations reproducibility can sometimes be limited. Therefore, separating each lesion parameter into its own ordinal scoring system is often preferred. Third, ordinal scores are inherently discontinuous data that are not normally distributed (bell-shaped) and require nonparametric statistical analyses. Data that are normally distributed should be analyzed with parametric analysis (eg, paired or unpaired t tests). Many statistics software packages include tests for normality for determining whether a given statistical test will be valid for the dataset. It is not appropriate to use parametric analysis to analyze data derived from ordinal scoring systems.3,4,46",
