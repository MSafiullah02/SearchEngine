            "text": "With its abrupt outbreak and rapid spread, coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been an unprecedented challenge to the health-care system in China. More than 40,000 health workers from all over the country were called upon and dispatched to the Wuhan metropolitan area, the origin and center of the epidemic where the medical system was overwhelmed. Among the 78,064 confirmed cases at the time of this writing, more than two-thirds were from Wuhan, more than 8,000 are in serious condition, and more than 3,000 Wuhan healthcare workers have been infected. [1] [2] [3] [4] In this large-scale mobilization of medical resources that has been the focus of media coverage for months, a key word frequently mentioned was that most physicians and nurses dispatched to Wuhan were from the department of \"PCCM.\" PCCM stands for pulmonary and critical care medicine. The term remains somewhat unfamiliar and even foreign to Chinese people, as well as to much of the rest of the world. PCCM as a combined concept has, for a long time, been a \"peculiarly American hybrid.\" 5 Facing the sudden disastrous COVID-19 epidemic, characterized by lung infection rapidly leading to a critical condition, a well-trained PCCM specialist is the professional best suited to take on this challenge. The Chinese PCCM team has been undoubtedly serving as the mainstay from the very beginning, in defending and winning the fight against this pandemic. How did a \"peculiarly American hybrid\" become a well-established medical specialty and, in fact, pioneered in the subspecialty training (fellowship) in China? The American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) has made an unparalleled contribution to this matter.",

            "text": "Following the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic in 2003, Chinese leaders in the field began to recognize the importance of incorporating critical care into the practice of respiratory medicine. After careful consideration, they decided to adopt the US model of PCCM, which has proved to be successful, both in terms of addressing real-world situations and attracting promising candidates to the profession. 6 The mission of CHEST encompasses medical education and international collaboration. In 2013, the Chinese Thoracic Society (CTS) and CHEST published an historical joint statement, declaring a collaboration in developing the PCCM subspecialty in China. 7 The China-CHEST PCCM fellowship program was launched in 2014. Curriculum and rotation structure were thoroughly planned, adapting the US model to the Chinese needs and culture. Seemingly coincidentally, the medical aspects required in the management of patients with COVID-19 encompass almost the entire curriculum content. [7] [8] [9] Experts from CHEST visited and provided hands-on training to faculties at each participating hospital. Under the supervision of a joint steering committee consisting of leading experts from CHEST and China, 54 PCCM fellows from 12 leading hospitals have since graduated from the program. 7, 8 In December 2016, the National Health Commission of China announced that formal subspecialty training (ie, National Fellowship) would become an integrated component of the postgraduate medical education system in China, and PCCM was selected as one of three pilot subspecialties. The China-Chest PCCM Fellowship naturally transitioned to the Chinese national program. Currently, more than 900 PCCM fellows are enrolled in 79 programs across China. 9 In line with the development of a PCCM fellowship program, a detailed standard for creation of a PCCM department was established by the CTS and the Chinese Association of Chest Physicians in 2018, consisting of six components: organization of the department, scope of practice, essential space and equipment, faculty and staff, administration body, and culture. Inclusion of medical and respiratory ICUs was emphasized as a main component of a PCCM department. By September 2019, more than 1,600 hospitals in China had participated and become compliant with requirements set forth by the PCCM Department Standardized Construction Program. 9 Thus, prior to the outbreak of the COVID-19 epidemic, the Chinese PCCM field had already become a wellorganized profession. Its highly respected leaders and a core team qualified by using an established set of standards have attracted a large number of enthusiastic applicants.",

With a huge number of asymptomatic potential virus carriers, the initial policy of home isolation was not sufficiently effective and was complicated by growing fear and helplessness. Chen Wang, current president of the Chinese Association of Chest Physicians and former president of the CTS, initiated the construction of converted hospitals for the purpose of isolation and monitoring. Large public venues such as stadiums and college/school dorms were converted into preliminary medical facilities to admit suspected carriers and verified patients who remained asymptomatic or only mildly symptomatic. The facilities were named Fang Cang hospitals, a name derived from the concept of military container shelters. The goal was to admit at the earliest time all those who should be 2 General Interest Commentary and Announcement isolated or monitored. Within a matter of days, 16 such facilities were functioning at capacity, with 13,000 admissions in Wuhan alone.
