Recently, there is enhanced quality guidance on clinical trial reporting of safety outcomes through adherence to the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines [1, 2]. However, there is scant literature on standardized ways to statistically analyse the safety outcomes in clinical trials. Although there exist some general regulatory guidelines on safety data analysis, such as International Conference on Harmonization which recommend descriptive statistical methods supplemented by confidence intervals [3, 4], the proposed statistical methods rarely account for the complexity of the collected safety data, e.g., recurrent adverse events (AEs). Effective solutions to statistical analysis of safety data in clinical trials may need to be tailored to specific indications (set of diseases with similar characteristics) since safety data collected are also influenced by the medical condition under study. Absence of standardized guidelines for safety data analysis in specific settings may limit the ability to draw rich conclusions about the safety of the investigational product, based on collected data. Standardized guidelines can simplify integration of safety information from multiple outcomes across RCTs [5] and would ensure optimal use of data in developing the safety profile of the investigational product.",

The safety endpoints may include clinical and laboratory defined AEs. Laboratory-based AEs are defined based on standard cut-off points for measures such as vital signs (e.g., body temperature), hepato-toxicity measures (e.g., bilirubin level), cardio-toxicity measures (e.g., electrocardiograms), and other tests relevant to the medical indication being studied [5]. The safety endpoints may be correlated within patients and over time such that failure to account for this in an analysis may yield biased estimates and false inference. Furthermore, time to occurrence of the safety endpoint may be very informative in profiling the drug safety. Such data present statistical analysis and interpretation challenges due to the complexity in structure [6]. For instance, in the case of multiple, repeatedly measured, safety outcomes, false positives may arise from multiple statistical testing if appropriate longitudinal or time to event methods and/or multiplicity adjustments are not considered.",

Occurrence of (even mild) AEs due to a drug would lead to non-adherence, leading to informative censoring. The dropping of the patients from the study generates missing data that may lead to biased results if poorly accounted for. Therefore, safety data analysis accounting for missing data is useful to facilitate identification and characterization of the safety profile of the drug as early as possible. Other analysis challenges include lack of adequate ascertainment and classification of AEs, and limited generalizability of results [9] since some AEs cannot be pre-specified at study design stage.",

One of the special settings in safety data assessment is the use of drugs to prevent adverse outcomes in pregnancy, currently referred to as intermittent preventive treatment of malaria in pregnancy (IPTp). For example, the World Health Organization recommends that pregnant women receive routine treatment with anti-malarial drugs to clear any malaria infection that is present and also to prevent infection in the weeks after administration [10]. Recent review indicates that methodological issues in studying anti-malarial drugs in pregnancy have prevented firm conclusions on the safety of new anti-malarial drugs in pregnancy [11]. Previous efforts have attempted to standardize safety assessment methodology for anti-malarial drug trials in pregnancy, including study designs and data collection [12, 13]. However, literature remains limited in describing the standard practice in the statistical analysis of safety data that are collected on anti-malarial drugs during pregnancy trials.",

Specifically, appropriate statistical analysis of safety outcomes can improve development of anti-malarial drug safety profile. This can be achieved through sufficient use of the data generated during the RCT which provides a comprehensive drug safety insight.

ISTp refers to intermittent rapid diagnostic testing (RDT) for malaria in pregnant women followed by treatment of RDT-positive cases with an effective artemisinin-based combination therapy, and IPTp is given to pregnant women regardless of their malaria status.

The MiPL is an excellent scholarly source of articles on malaria in pregnancy that enabled the review to capture both indexed and non-indexed articles beyond the searched databases. Additional searches included reference lists of the identified trials and relevant reviews to identify trials potentially missed in the database search. The year 2010 was selected since it is when CONSORT guideline updated and emphasized on appropriate statistical analysis and reporting of clinical trials [15]. Conference proceedings were not included because they usually contain abstracts that do not give detailed analysis of the presented results and they are not rigorously peer-reviewed. The review focussed on published studies only so no experts or abstract publication authors were contacted for unpublished data. The key search items included: malaria, anti-malarial drug, pregnancy, efficacy safety or tolerability. The detailed search strategy is presented in Additional file 2: Table S2. The search was customized per database. Based on PRISMA procedure, after removing duplicates, two reviewers (NP and ANK) independently screened titles and abstracts initially before arriving at a final list of eligible articles. Based on the eligible studies list, full text articles were retrieved. The references were managed using Endnote X7.1 (Thomson Reuters).

The findings are useful to advance the development of standardized guidelines for safety data statistical analysis in analysis in anti-malarial drugs in pregnancy trials and related fields.

The information loss may lead to reduction in statistical power to detect safety signal if it exists. Valid longitudinal methods (used without restriction on cut-off points) can address the information loss by exploiting potential within-subject correlations for the repeated clinical laboratory measurements [19\u201321]. Furthermore, the longitudinal methods can provide the basis for developing improved cut-off points tailored to pregnant women in malaria-specific settings. To ensure improved uptake of such methods, future work needs to strive towards making the results from the longitudinal methods feasibly interpretable to the medical practitioners.",

Adjusting for known prognostic covariates is useful to control for confounding that can be introduced due to imbalance when assessing if treatment is independently associated with safety outcome(s). Of secondary interest, covariate adjustment also preserves type I error [22]. Such adjustment for potential confounders (e.g., age) in safety data analysis are suitable in clinical trials with at least moderate sample size, unlike small sample sizes that lead to unstable estimates. Of specific interest in this review, the Poisson model was more suitable in the context of rare AEs which usually have low event rates [21, 23]. Since Poisson regression assumes a constant rate of occurrence of a rare event, it is not ideal for other multiple transient AEs that were common or recurred and would vary in occurrence overtime [24]. Alternatively, mixed effects models could be considered to characterize the safety events over time since they capture patient-specific effects [25, 26]. Whenever time to AE occurrence information is available, survival analysis models may also be preferred to characterize the time to AE occurrence. For recurrent safety events, that may induce dependence, methods that extend the Cox regression model may be preferred; such models include survival mixed effects models (e.g., frailty models) [4].",

If per protocol analysis is used to address non-adherence there is potential selection bias since it destroys the balance due to randomization. Although CONSORT recommends ITT, as an alternative for analysis of safety endpoints, non-adherence cannot be explicitly addressed with ITT approach since it ignores dropouts, withdrawal or loss-to-follow up for various reasons including safety concerns; ITT-based inference ignores causal effect of the actual treatment received [27]. Patient withdrawal or dropout due to AEs can induce informative censoring useful in quantifying anti-malarial drug safety. For example, if a patient withdraws due to vomiting after taking an anti-malarial drug, their obstetric efficacy outcomes such as birth weight may appear as missing data. In the context of anti-malarial drug for malaria prevention, even mild AE can lead to drug non-adherence. Since the patient has no disease symptoms, they would judge it less costly for them to discontinue the drug than continue experiencing AEs. Hence, inclusion of information on treatment/trial completion status in relation to anti-malarial safety would enrich development of the safety profile of anti-malarial drug in pregnancy. Although study completion status, anti-malarial drug safety and missing data may be interlinked, missing data received limited attention such that the few trials that considered efficacy missing data did not explicitly explore the potential link. Studying such complex associations requires statistical methods that can appropriately estimate the pathway from the anti-malarial chemoprevention to study completion. Advantageously, methods based on causal inference framework, such as mediation analysis [28\u201331] could be adapted/extended to assess the influence of the AEs on non-adherence in RCTs.",

Although the statistical approach for safety assessment was mainly on superiority hypotheses (for both the superiority and non-superiority trials), clinical and statistical justification of assessing safety based on superiority hypotheses may be invalid. Superiority hypotheses concentrate on the absence of difference in drug safety effect/risk between or across the treatment arms which may be challenging [16]. For example, when comparing high AE incidences, non-significant difference (when using a superiority hypothesis) would not necessarily translate to a conclusion that a drug is safe and well-tolerated since sometimes all compared treatment arms may have high AE incidence. Perhaps, drug safety evaluation should strive to prove that there is no risk beyond a protocol-defined/hypothesized priori clinical safety margin (i.e., no excessive safety risk). Based on the findings in this work, researchers are encouraged to consider defining safety margins in safety assessment of anti-malarial drugs. Since safety is mostly a secondary outcome, it is not straightforward on how to define a non-inferiority margin and the appropriate analysis population. Currently, it is still unclear and debatable how to implement this, such that further research is needed [5].",

This review concurs with a recent review that has noted that inappropriate handling of multiple test is prevalent, although their review focussed on four high impact journals, AE in general and a short time of review period [38]. Issues raised in this review include time-dependence of AEs, informative censoring due to discontinuation of treatment because of AEs, safety graphs, and repeated occurrence of AEs and multivariate longitudinal structure of laboratory data that yields complex correlation. This is an ongoing work whereby further analysis will be explored to address the identified statistical issues above.",

Descriptive statistical methods and dichotomization of continuous outcomes are predominant which may lead to loss of useful information. The definition of analysis population and informative presentation of results are not standardized. Overall, the results suggest that choice of a statistical method(s) to use should be jointly driven by the scientific question of interest, epidemiological/clinical plausibility of the method and structure of the raw data. Further work in addressing the highlighted gaps can enhance drug safety decisions and conclusions.",
