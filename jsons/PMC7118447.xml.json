Microglia act as the major immune cells in the central nervous system. In response to brain injury or during neurodegenerative processes, microglia are activated by secreting growth factors, proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor\u2010\u03b1 (TNF\u2010\u03b1) and nitric oxide (NO), and reactive oxygen species [[3], [8], [9], [10], [11]]. Although microglial activation is necessary and important for host defense, over\u2010activation of microglia is neurotoxic. Studies have shown that microglia activated after ischemic stroke will produce cytokines to trigger neuronal death in response to ischemic injury [[6], [12]]. They also found that the inhibition of inflammation would prevent the progressive brain loss following a stroke. Thus, to develop the agents that reduce microglial activation and their proinflammatory responses is considered an important therapeutic strategy for neuroinflammatory disorders such as cerebral ischemia, AD, and PD.",

            "text": "\nToona sinensis (TS), a well\u2010known Chinese herb, is widely available in Asia. All parts of TS, including its root, bark, petioles, leaves, fruits, and seeds, have been used for medicinal purposes [[13], [14], [15]]. The leaves of TS are a popular vegetable amongst vegetarians in Taiwan. It also serves as an ingredient in some Chinese and Malaysian recipes. In the field of traditional Chinese medicine, the leaves of TS have been used for treating enteritis, dysentery, diabetes, infection, and itch, with no irreversible side effects observed after treatment [16]. Recent studies have also revealed that the aqueous extracts of TS leaves (TSL\u20101) have a variety of biological functions, including: (1) antioxidant activities [[17], [18]]; (2) the lowering of blood sugar levels via mediating adipose glucose transporter [[19], [20]]; (3) the alleviation of liver fibrosis via reducing tumor growth factor\u2010\u03b21 and collagen [21]; (4) the inhibition of coronavirus replication in severe acute respiratory syndrome [22]; (5) the decrease of steroidogenesis in mouse Leydig cells [23]; and (6) the inhibition of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)\u2010induced angiogenesis in vascular endothelial cells [24]. In addition, TSL\u20101 has antiproliferative properties in human lung cancer cells [[25], [26], [27], [28]], oral squamous carcinoma cells [29], and human premyelocytic leukemia cells [30]\nin vitro. Furthermore, there was no acute lethal effect even at a maximal oral tested dose of 5000 mg/kg of body weight in mice [[31], [32]]. Interestingly, one of these findings demonstrated that daily dietary supplement of TSL\u20101 in senescence\u2010accelerated mice (an AD model) improved brain degeneration caused by the incidence of \u03b2 amyloid plaques [17]. This points to the possibility that TSL\u20101 may pass through the blood\u2013brain barrier to affect the central nervous system. Recent studies have also found that the appearance of amyloid plaques in the brain coincides with a dramatic phenotypic activation of the surrounding microglia, which release proinflammatory cytokines and neurotoxic substances, for disease progression [[33], [34]]. Liao et al.'s findings [17] indicated that TSL\u20101 supplement in aged mice had a potential effect on neuroinflammation due to the recruitment of activated microglia in amyloid plaques. Therefore, this study aimed to examine whether TSL\u20101 would modulated neuroinflammation\u2010associated diseases such as AD through microglia. At the same time, because the systemic administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS, a heat\u2010stable bacterial cell wall component) in mouse brain, causing amyloid protein accumulation and neuroinflammation, was being used to study the underlying mechanisms of AD [[35], [36], [37]], we tested the potential anti\u2010inflammation effect of TSL\u20101 in the in vitro model of LPS\u2010induced microglial activation system.",

Reverse osmosis water was added to TS leaves at a proportion of 4 L of reverse osmosis water to 1 kg of leaves. The mixture was boiled for 30 minutes, after which the leaves were removed and the remaining liquid concentrated over low heat and filtered with a sieve (70 meshes). The filtered concentrate was lyophilized with a Virtis apparatus (Gardiner, NY, USA) to obtain a crude extract. The crude extracts were centrifuged at 1400g for 12 minutes, and the supernatant\u2010labeled TSL\u20101 (an advanced bioactive fraction of TS) was used for this study. The extracts were then concentrated in a vacuum, freeze\u2010dried to form a powder, and stored at \u221220\u00b0C for subsequent analysis.

When the iNOS production at 24 hours after LPS treatment was determined, the addition of TSL\u20101 at 0 hours and 1 hour after LPS treatment still exhibited an inhibitory effect on LPS\u2010induced iNOS production (0 hours: 47.5%; 1 hour: 50.18% of LPS alone). However, the addition of TSL\u20101 at 2 hours after LPS treatment showed no obvious inhibitory effect on iNOS production.",

NO production and iNOS expression were significantly inhibited by TSL\u20101 in a concentration\u2010dependent manner in the microglial BV\u20102 cell line. This anti\u2010inflammatory effect of TS was also evidenced by inhibiting TNF\u2010\u03b1 release. Moreover, the cell viability assay showed that treatment with TSL\u20101 alone did not have cytotoxic effects at concentrations of 5\u201350 \u03bcg/mL, whereas TSL\u20101 significantly inhibited those inflammatory factors stimulated by LPS. In this connection, we suggest that TSL\u20101 might have a potent antineuroinflammatory activity via the inhibition of LPS\u2010stimulated production of TNF\u2010\u03b1, NO, as well as iNOS protein in microglia.",

The results indicated that even post\u2010treatment with TSL\u20101 (50 \u03bcg/mL), later than LPS application, is effective in the reduction of NO release and iNOS protein level. Accumulating evidence indicates that iNOS is the most important contributor to NO production in the brain after inflammatory assault, compared with other isoforms of NOS, namely eNOS and nNOS [[42], [43]]. Furthermore, a novel approach with NO\u2010donating nonsteroidal anti\u2010inflammatory drugs develops a safe profile that strongly reduces their untoward side effects without altering the anti\u2010inflammatory effectiveness [[44], [45], [46], [47]]. These findings correlate the important role of NO in the function of the central nervous system. In the central nervous system, activated microglia are the major cellular source of iNOS. Therefore, the inhibitory effect that TSL\u20101 exerts on iNOS might be beneficial not only in the protection of neurons but also as therapy through microglia.",

More than eight compounds, including gallic acid, methyl gallate, ethyl gallate, kaempferol, kaempferol\u20103\u2010O\u2010b\u2010D\u2010glucoside, quercetin, quercitrin, quercetin\u20103\u2010O\u2010\u03b2\u2010D\u2010glucoside, and rutin, have been isolated from TSL\u20101, as previously described [[30], [48]]. Of these compounds, gallic acid isolated directly from TSL\u20101 has been demonstrated to possess effective antioxidant activity against various oxidative stress such as leukemia, atherogenesis, prostate cancer, oral carcinoma, and angiogenesis in the liver, kidney, and testis [[18], [24], [29], [30], [49], [50]]. Quercetin purified from TSL\u20101 specifically elevates the activities of antioxidant enzymes only in the testis [50]. In the central nervous system, gallic acid and quercetin have also been found to reduce neuronal damage by inhibiting microglia\u2010mediated NO release, TNF\u2010\u03b1 production, and oxidative stress [[51], [52], [53], [54], [55]]. Therefore, it is reasonable to infer the potential therapeutic effect of TSL\u20101 or its compounds, such as gallic acid or quercetin, on the suppression of inflammatory\u2010related neuronal injury and oxidative stress in neurodegenerative diseases.",

            "text": "The application of traditional Chinese herbs for medicinal use has attracted attention in recent years. Increasing evidence has suggested that Chinese herbs have therapeutic effects on neurodegenerative diseases such as PD and AD through their anti\u2010inflammatory features [[56], [57], [58]]. These traditional Chinese medicines, such as the extracts of Tripterygium wilfordii Hook. f. and Anemarrhena asphodeloides Bunge, or the more recently studied grape seed extract, have been shown to promote neuronal survival and neurite growth, to facilitate functional recovery after brain injury, and to act as inhibitors of neuroinflammatory toxicity of activated\u2010microglia. However, it has been proposed that an exacerbated inflammatory response was responsible for causing the impairment in the phagocytosis of amyloid protein deposits by microglia in the AD brain. In this connection, the discovery of agents that are capable of increasing amyloid protein uptake by phagocytic cells is of potential therapeutic interest for AD. In fact, with amyloid \u03b2 treatment, the blockade of chloride intracellular ion channel 1 will stimulate amyloid \u03b2 phagocytosis in microglia while inhibiting iNOS induction and TNF\u2010\u03b1 production [[59], [60]]. In the present study, pretreatment with TSL\u20101 has proved protective against LPS\u2010induced microglial activation. Treatment with TSL\u20101 at 0 hours and 1 hour post\u2010LPS treatment also exhibited similar degrees of antineuroinflammatory effect comparable to that observed with pretreatment. Therefore, it is likely that the attenuation of LPS\u2010stimulated NO release and NO production are at least partially responsible for neuroinflammation of TSL\u20101. However, the potential effect of TSL\u20101 in modifying microglial activation with enhancing amyloid \u03b2 clearance needs to be addressed.",

Because therapeutic agents from herbal sources are usually perceived as being natural and devoid of side effects. It is reasonable to consider TSL\u20101 as another potential therapeutic agent that works by inhibiting the inflammatory response of microglia in neurodegenerative diseases. To confirm its effect, further studies in in vivo animal models are necessary.",
