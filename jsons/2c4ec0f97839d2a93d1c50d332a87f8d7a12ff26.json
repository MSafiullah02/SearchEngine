We report temporal detection frequency for common respiratory viruses in air sampled from a university campus in Hong Kong, where 28 000 undergraduate and postgraduate students as well as 7000 staff interact daily. IAVs and IBVs were detected at higher frequencies than other respiratory viruses. A recent study that collected nasopharyngeal swabs of 2685 tourists in New York City reported a higher detection frequency for HRV and HCoV than IAV at 3.2%, 2.4%, and 0.2%, respectively [6, 7] . To attain a comprehensive understanding on the potential transmission modes for respiratory viruses, future studies should sample concurrently from humans and their surrounding environment.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 682, "end": 685, "text": "[6,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 686, "end": 688, "text": "7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}, {"text": "Influenza A(H3N2) and B viruses that caused epidemics in Hong Kong during the study period were detected in air sampled on campus prior to the peak influenza activity in the community but not afterwards, which may reflect changes in susceptibility of the population to the epidemic strain.

Low copies of vRNA (below LoQ) were detected from 80.7% (71/88) of the nonsubtypable samples and from 65.5% (19/29) of the H1 or H3 subtypable samples by rRT-qPCR (\u03c7 2 test, P = .154). Similarly, most IBV-positive samples (80.6% [25/31]) contained low copies of viral genome that were below the LoQ. Detection of HRV, RSV, and HCoV in air was limited. Among 270 NIOSH samplers applied from week 41 of 2016 to week 18 of 2017, vRNA of HRV, RSV, and HCoV was detected in 2.2% (6/270; cycle threshold [Ct] >37.4), 0.4% (1/270; Ct = 39.3), and 0% (0/270). During the same period, IAV, IBV, or both were detected at 20.7% (56/270), 3.0% (8/270), and 1.1% (3/270), respectively. Although the detection frequency for HRV, RSV, and HCoV were significantly lower than that of IAV in air (\u03c7 2 test, P < .001), HRV was detected at higher frequency than other respiratory viruses among clinical samples collected from symptomatic patients in Hong Kong [33] (Supplementary", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF1": {"text": "Quantity and Size Distribution of Respiratory Virus-laden Particles in Air Sampled From a University CampusAbbreviations: NIOSH, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health; rRT-qPCR, quantitative real-time reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF2": {"text": "Univariate Analyses on Factors Associated With the Detection of Influenza Viral RNA in Air Indoor CO 2 concentration was categorized into high, intermediate, and low based on the numeric data distribution: high (upper 33% percentile), intermediate (middle 33% percentile), and low (lower 33% percentile).", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF3": {"text": "Multivariable Analyses on Factors Associated With the Detection of Influenza Viral RNA in Air aOR (95% CI); P Value aOR (95% CI); P Value aOR (95% CI); P Value aOR (95% CI); P Value Crowdedness (No. of occupants on site) a Sampling performed on teaching days vs holidays was highly associated with numbers of occupants on site (\u03c7 2 test, P < .001); as such, crowdedness (number of occupants on site) was included in the multivariable analysis.
