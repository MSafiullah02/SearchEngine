Government guidance aside, many companies acted early and self-imposed social distancing and remote working on their employees if their roles allowed it; for example, the only research that can take place on University College London campuses is that which is in the immediate national interest, i.e. research on COVID-19 [21]. Pharmaceutical and medical technology companies are also prioritising their research and development towards COVID-19, working on diagnostic tests, vaccines and/or therapies [22]. Given this and that most new technologies are developed onsite in laboratories, COVID-19 will likely impact the development of future technologies.

When committees do meet, they will need to be quorate and may require in camera sessions because of confidential discussions regarding price. There has been quick uptake of videoconferencing software, but there are some concerns regarding the security of these platforms [23]. Additionally, it may be that there is less patient participation in these virtual HTA committees, those with certain medical conditions and possibly individuals without computer skills may not be able to participate in the same manner that they would when in a face-to-face meeting.",

While NICE COVID-19 guidelines appear to have been issued devoid of formal economic appraisals, it would be unusual for policy makers to adopt treatments and preventative approaches without assessing both effectiveness and cost effectiveness. Different HTA agencies have different levels of oversight, for example, in Australia and New Zealand, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee and Pharmaceutical Management Agency (PHARMAC), respectively, review both pharmaceuticals and vaccines, but in the UK, NICE reviews pharmaceuticals while the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) assesses vaccines [34]. This introduces the potential for different agencies to apply different standards to the many COVID-19 interventions; indeed, NICE has different reference cases for public health interventions and health technologies.",

Health economists are no strangers to modelling and extrapolating trial data, or making and testing assumptions to undertake HTAs (see [37] for a COVID-19 modelling example); but assumptions should never replace the opportunity to collect actual data, particularly to go beyond clinical outcomes of hospitalisations to consider quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). Early HTA can inform research and development during the initial stages of clinical research \u2014 potentially important with so many competing treatments being trialled \u2014 and help address uncertainty [38]. It is likely that such therapies will be fast tracked through any HTA process (and thereby delay other topics), but faster appraisal may mean drugs are approved that are neither clinically nor cost effective, or there is a greater chance of a negative recommendation as the committee considers there are too many uncertainties.",

The majority of investment in COVID-19 has to date been new funding, i.e. not at the expense of the current healthcare budget although arguably at the expense of the wider economy. This and the various stimulus packages that have been announced globally are the result of quantitative easing and/or government borrowing. In the short run, these stimulus packages will allow the economy and healthcare systems to function, but a global recession is highly likely, and consumer and business confidence will take a hit. Venture capital funding may be difficult to secure, which will add challenges for the life sciences sector bringing new innovations to market.",

Therefore, a well-functioning HTA system (as many countries have) will be critical. What is not clear is whether governments will constrain the budgets of HTA agencies, which would be reflected in part in them facing a lower threshold of cost effectiveness. Given the perceived inflexibility across countries of the threshold [41, 42], and the disconnect between adoption decisions and budget impact (for example, NICE does not face the opportunity cost of its decisions, NHS England does [43]) it may be that HTA needs to focus its efforts on \u2018technology management\u2019 rather than \u2018technology adoption\u2019 and evaluate divesting in inefficient services or low-value healthcare [44]. Alternatively, HTA agencies in response to financial uncertainty may become more risk averse, which could be further magnified given the evidence base they will evaluate may be more uncertain because of the current disruption to clinical trials. It may be that faced with such a situation, HTA agencies and other healthcare funders will rely more heavily on other coverage decision approaches such as risk sharing arrangements or managed access schemes [45]. These innovative market access policies may be accompanied by innovations in pricing arrangements, including outcome-based payments [46], thereby promoting patient access despite the uncertainty in the evidence base and an aversion to risk at times of financial crisis [47].",
