RS domain variants, such as serine and arginine\u2010rich motifs or arginine\u2013aspartate or arginine\u2013glutamate dipeptide\u2010rich domains, are also found in many nuclear proteins. In addition to the RS domains, SR splicing factors often contain one or more RNA recognition motifs. SR proteins function in both constitutive and regulated splicing via binding to cis\u2010elements of pre\u2010mRNA or interaction with other splicing factors. The RS domain interacts with both proteins and RNAs [1, 2, 3]. In particular, intermolecular interactions between SR proteins, which are important for spliceosome assembly and splice site determination during pre\u2010mRNA splicing, are mediated by their RS domains [3]. The RS domain also acts as a nuclear localization signal and targets SR proteins to nuclear speckled domains, where splicing factors are concentrated, for storage [1].",

RS domain phosphorylation can modulate protein\u2013protein and protein\u2013RNA interactions of SR proteins [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. Reversible phosphorylation of SR proteins is important for assembly and function of the spliceosome and for proper regulation of alternative splicing, and also controls their subnuclear localization and nucleocytoplasmic transport [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6].

Functional investigation of this E2 protein has indicated that its RS\u2010rich hinge domain can facilitate splicing of the transcripts made via transactivation by E2 itself [9].

This core protein is a phosphoprotein, and its function may be modulated by phosphorylation [10, 18, 19, 20]. The C\u2010terminal region of the core protein contains several nonconsecutive RS dipeptides as well as three SPRRR repeats (Fig. 1). Analysis of an HBV strain has revealed that phosphorylation mainly occurs at the SPRRR repeats [10]. Another report shows that the core protein C\u2010terminal domain may be phosphorylated by SRPK1/2 in host cells [13]. However, a more recent study revealed that although SRPK1/2 could suppress viral replication by interfering with pre\u2010genomic RNA packaging, the kinase activity appeared to be dispensable [20]. Therefore, the role of SRPK1/2 in HBV core protein phosphorylation, if any, remains to be investigated.",

The nucleocapsid (N) protein is the most abundant viral protein produced throughout viral infection, and plays multiple roles in the viral life cycle, including in viral encapsidation, replication and transcription [21]. Both the N\u2010terminal and C\u2010terminal domains of the N protein contribute to nucleic acid binding, and the latter is additionally involved in oligomerization [22, 23, 24]. Coronavirus N proteins of different species share limited similarity with each other, but all contain an R/S\u2010rich segment in the central region (Fig. 1). Phosphorylation may occur at multiple sites within this R/S\u2010rich motif [12, 25, 26]. Experimental analyses have indicated that various cellular kinases, including cyclin\u2010dependent kinases, GSK, casein kinase II, mitogen\u2010activated protein kinases, and SRPKs, may phosphorylate coronavirus N proteins [11, 12]. We have recently observed that the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS\u2010CoV) N protein redistributes to cytoplasmic stress granules in response to environmental stress [12]. However, such redistribution can be prevented by overexpression of SRPK1, which suggests that SRPK1 targets the N protein in cells [12]. Nevertheless, heterogeneous phosphorylation of the N protein may indicate its dynamic phosphorylation status and perhaps multiple functions during viral infection [27].",

Recent evidence suggests that phosphorylated infectious bronchitis virus N protein preferentially recognizes viral RNA over nonviral RNA [22]. We recently reported that phosphorylation of the SARS\u2010CoV N protein within the RS motif moderately impairs its multimerization [12]. Therefore, it is possible that the phosphorylation status of coronavirus N protein determines its activity in viral RNA transcription and packaging. Moreover, coronavirus N protein may also influence various cellular processes. Coronavirus infection causes cellular translation shutoff in the host, probably via the activity of the N protein [28]. Our recent report shows that the SARS\u2010CoV N protein can suppress translation, and that this activity depends on the RS motif of SARS\u2010CoV N protein, but is attenuated by its phosphorylation [12]. Therefore, we speculate that coronavirus N protein contributes to viral infection\u2010induced translation inhibition, which can be governed by the level of N protein phosphorylation.",

Cellular SR proteins bind to an intronic element of the IIIa pre\u2010mRNA to inhibit exon IIIa inclusion. E4\u2010ORF4 interacts directly with the SR proteins ASF/SF2 and SRp30c.

This IRES\u2010mediated translation can be stimulated by an optimal dose of the core protein [39, 40]. The core protein interacts directly with a cellular RS domain\u2010containing protein, DDX3 [41, 42, 43]. DDX3 is a phylogenetically conserved member of the DEAD box RNA helicase family, and is involved in various mRNA metabolic events, including pre\u2010mRNA splicing, mRNA export and mRNA translation [44, 45, 46, 47, 48]. Coincident with the HCV core\u2013DDX3 interaction, a mild activation of HCV IRES\u2010mediated translation has been observed after overexpression of DDX3 [48]. Moreover, it has also been shown that depletion of DDX3 from human hepatoma HuH\u20107 cells decreases HCV RNA expression [49]. Therefore, DDX3 not only interacts with an HCV protein but may also modulate viral activity. Notably, upregulation of DDX3 has been observed in hepatocellular carcinoma [50].

As described above, the adenovirus E4\u2010ORF4 protein recruits PP2A to dephosphorylate SR proteins, and thereby activates IIIa pre\u2010mRNA splicing [35]. The HSV ICP27 protein instead interacts with and inactivates SRPK1, which also results in hypophosphorylation of SR proteins and hence pre\u2010mRNA splicing inhibition [30]. Moreover, adenovirus infection induces de novo synthesis of ceramide followed by nonapoptotic cell death, and adenovirus E4\u2010ORF4 can act through this ceramide signaling pathway to modulate SR protein phosphorylation levels [72]. This is reminiscent of the scenario of FAS ligand\u2010induced ceramide accumulation, which results in dephosphorylation of SR proteins and, hence, changes in alternative splicing patterns [73]. Similarly, infection of vaccinia virus induces dephosphorylation and inactivation of SR proteins [74]. Vaccinia virus encodes its own dual\u2010specificity PP, VH1, and thus its infection causes more severe dephosphorylation of SR proteins than adenovirus and HSV [74].",

Through the RS domain or R/S\u2010rich motifs present in viral proteins, a virus may efficiently make use of the cellular splicing machinery to benefit its own gene expression. Phosphorylation of the RS domain can modulate the biological function of viral SR proteins, which may in turn impact on viral gene expression or other activities (Fig. 2). Moreover, through interactions with cellular SR proteins or by modifying their phosphorylation status, several non\u2010SR viral proteins may interfere with cellular gene expression at the post\u2010transcriptional level (Fig. 2). Cellular SR proteins and their cooperative or antagonistic factors may play a critical role in the life cycle control of viruses, which involves a series of alternative splicing events for expression of viral genome or proteins. However, if the expression of these host factors is spatially or temporally controlled, viral RNA splicing patterns may differ between cell types and differentiation stages. Nevertheless, there is still much to learn about how viruses undergo alternative splicing in various host cell environments.",

Although this process is not yet well understood, cellular SR proteins have been implicated as antiviral targets or therapeutic agents. When tethered to a pre\u2010mRNA, a synthetic RS repeat\u2010containing peptide is able to rescue defective splicing caused by mutations in the cis\u2010regulatory element [76]. Indole derivatives have been used to reduce HIV\u20101 RNA synthesis and viral particle assembly by specifically interfering with the splicing activity of ASF/SF2, which is involved in the expression of HIV\u20101 viral proteins [77]. To modulate the phosphorylation level of SR proteins, SR protein kinase inhibitors have recently been developed [75]. An inhibitor specific to SRPK1/2 can suppress HIV expression, perhaps by inactivating SRp75 [69]. Moreover, downregulation of a specific SR protein using RNA interference may be useful in manipulating viral activity. Certainly, a more comprehensive understanding of post\u2010transcriptional regulation governed by viruses will benefit the future development of antiviral strategies.",
