Among these\npulmonary diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease claimed 3.0 million lives\nin 2016, while lung cancer caused 1.7 million deaths (1). Since current treatments of these diseases have limited\nefficacy, many studies are being conducted to find novel effective treatments.\nThough most lung diseases are considered to be the product of a variety of\nendogenous and exogenous influences, and less obviously are associated with gene\nreplacement therapy. Abnormal conditions are likely to arise from an imbalance\nbetween destructive and protective mechanisms. Nucleic acids can be a new class of\ntherapeutics to reconstitute a homeostatic balance by overexpression of protective\ngenes or the suppression of damaging genes, which offers new strategies for the\ntreatment of respiratory diseases (2).\nThe mesh-like network of blood vessels in the lungs, coupled with easy access\nthrough the pulmonary airways, enables the lungs to be targeted by both intravenous\nand topical routes. The latter fact makes the lung unique compared with other\norgans, allowing specific lung sites such as alveolar cells and bronchial epithelium\nto be exclusively targeted for different therapeutic applications (3). In this review, we focus on nucleic\nacid-based therapies for pulmonary diseases. We discuss the hurdles nucleic acids\nface for translation into clinics and recent progress in the product into clinical\ntrials.",

After introduction into the cytoplasm, siRNAs interact with multifunctional\nprotein Argonaute-2 and form the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), where one of\nthe strands is degraded and the other strand (mostly antisense) is left as a guide\nto recognizing target mRNA sequences. Subsequently, mRNAs which are perfect or\nnearly perfectly complementary to the siRNA antisense strand are cleaved by the\nactivated RISCs (9). The specific gene\nsilencing effect of siRNAs makes them indispensable tools for target identification\nand validation in drug discovery and development (10). In 2018, Onpattro (patisiran) infusion became the first\nFDA-approved siRNA drug. It is for the treatment of peripheral nerve disease caused\nby hereditary transthyretin-mediated amyloidosis in adult patients. Onpattro is\ndesigned to interfere with RNA production of an abnormal form of the protein\ntransthyretin.

Tumor suppressor miRNAs (e.g., let-7, miR-34 families, and miR-15/16) are\nresponsible for suppressing oncogenes and are mostly downregulated in cancer.\nRestoration of their normal function can be achieved by miRNA replacement via administration of synthetic miRNA mimics\nfunctioning similarly to the endogenous counterparts.

Hence, the first barriers that nucleic acid drugsvia these two routes encounter are\nblood and respiratory tract (Fig. 1). Parenteral administration of unmodified nucleic acids has\nbeen set back by their very short half-life in the bloodstream, serum\nnuclease degradation, quick renal clearance, and poor biodistribution. The\nparenteral route also exposes the whole human body to nucleic acids, which\nmay hamper the delivery efficiency to target tissues or organs (22). To avoid enzymatic degradation and\nrenal clearance, local drug administration routes have been proposed to\ndirectly deliver the drugs to the site of interest. Pulmonary administration\nreveals a strong potentiality as it could transport therapeutic agents to\ndiseased lung tissue in a non-invasive manner. While the degradation by\nnucleases is negligible comparing to systemic administration, delivery\nthrough the airway could be hampered by physiological barriers. The\nmucociliary clearance action, the surface liquid that covers the airway and\nmacrophages along different parts of the airways, limits the transport of\nnucleic acids to the site of action (23). The highly viscous mucus layer in the airways traps\nand prevents nucleic acids reaching the underlying epithelium and propelled\nthem out with the impact of cillated cells (24). Thus, the development of particles that could\nefficiently penetrate the mucus barrier, without compromising its protective\nproperties, is a clear challenge for improving pulmonary drug delivery\n(25).",

Intracellular nucleic acids\nare transported in early endosome vesicles where various nucleases exist and\nthe pH further reduce to 4.5 in the process to late endosomes and lysosomes,\nand most nucleic acids degraded in the endosome before reaching the site of\naction (27). The classic\napproach has been to use small-molecule endosomolytic agents like\nchloroquine to disrupt endosomes and release entrapped oligonucleotides from\nendosomes. Two similar types of small molecules have been reported recently\nwith the help of a high-throughput screen of chemical libraries. These\nmolecules substantially enhanced the pharmacological activities of\noligonucleotides both in cell culture and murine model (28,29). Although these endosomolytic agents significantly\nenhanced the delivery efficiency, they currently display a narrow\ntherapeutic window for clinical use.",

            "text": "Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the\nUSA and worldwide (62). According\nto the difference in histology, 87% cases of lung cancer are classified as\nnon-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and 13% cases are small cell lung cancer\n(SCLC). In addition to SCLC and NSCLC, malignant pleural mesothelioma is a rare\nform of lethal cancer developing in the tissue lining of the lungs (63). Current treatments for lung cancers\ninclude surgical resection, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and targeted drug\ntherapy, but these existing therapeutics have limited efficacy, and survival\nrate of NSCLC patients has remained low (63). Therefore, studies on target treatment of lung cancers\nwith selective nucleic acid against oncogenic pathways have drawn intensive\ninterest and some of them have entered clinical practice. Custirsen (OGX-011) is\na PS-ASO inhibitor of clusterin, an anti-apoptotic chaperone protein upregulated\nin cancer cells in response to chemotherapy and might mediate resistance\n(64). Preclinical data showed\nthat custirsen significantly decreases clusterin production, increases the\nsensitivity of lung cancer cells to chemotherapies, and inhibits tumor growth in\nlung cancer models. In the phase 2 trial of custirsen in patients who were\ntreated with a combination of a gemcitabine/platinum doublet, serum clusterin\nlevels were notably reduced. A larger randomized phase 3 study is needed to\ndemonstrate the potential survival benefit of custirsen in patients with NSCLC\n(65). Imetelstat (GRN163L) is a\n13 base phosphoramidate oligonucleotide conjugated to a 5-palmitoyl lipid group\nagainst the RNA component of telomerase, an enzyme responsible for maintaining\ntelomere length and crucial for the indefinite growth of tumor cells. Blocking\ntelomerase with imetelstat leads to antineoplastic effects. In a phase 2 study,\nimetelstat failed to improve progress-free survival rates in advanced NSCLC\npatients with diverse telomere. But there was a trend toward survival\nimprovement for patients with shorter telomeres. Further investigations on short\ntelomeres as predictive biomarkers are warranted for clinical development of\nimetelstat (66).",

Tumor suppressor miRNAs in lung cancer include let-7 family,\nmiR-34/449 family, miR-15/16, miR-200 family, and miR-205; oncomiRNAs in lung\ncancers include miR-17~92 cluster, miR-21, and miR-221/222 (62). There are two approaches for miRNA\nmodulators to act as cancer therapies: exploiting antisense-based inhibitors of\noncogenic miRNAs or replacing downregulated tumor suppressor miRNAs with\nsynthetic miRNA mimics (69). To\ndate, there are two tumor suppressive miRNA mimics of miRNA-34 (MRX34; Mirna\nTherapeutics Inc.) and miRNA-16 (TargomiRs; EnGeneIC Ltd.) that have entered\nclinical trials. MRX34 is a synthetic version of miR-34a encapsulated in\nliposomes. miR-34a is a tumor suppressor often expressed at reduced levels in a\nbroad range of cancer types, which functions to downregulate the expression of\nmore than 30 different oncogenes across multiple oncogenic pathways\n(70). But immune-related\nserious side effects caused termination of the trial of MRX34. TargomiRs are\ndouble-strand synthetic miR-16-based microRNA mimics delivered by EnGeneIC Dream\nVectors which are deprived from nonliving bacterial minicells with a targeting\nmoiety (71,72). The miR-16 family has been implicated\nas tumor suppressor in a range of cancer types, and their primary targets are\ngenes (e.g., BCL2, CDK1, and JUN) involved in cancer progression. In vitro and in\nvivo studies showed that the restoration of expression of miR16\nin malignant pleural mesothelioma induced the apoptosis of tumor cells and\ninhibited tumor growth. Long-term survival after a short treatment period was\nobserved in the phase 1 study. However, the safety issue and early signs of\nactivity of TargomiRs still warrant further clinical trials (71).",

Besides,\nthe current drugs fail to stop or reverse the airway remodeling and some of the\ndrugs followed with concerns of long-term adverse effects, which means there are\nunmet needs for better drugs (75,76). Choi et\nal. developed a novel therapy combining traditional drugs with novel\ntherapeutics. In the regimen, dexamethasone (DEXA) was attached to PEIs to act\nas a controller ingredient to control the airway inflammation. While siRNA\nagainst vitamin D binding protein, which is a responsible molecule of allergic\nasthma, was delivered by DEXA-PEI at the same time (77). This multi-target treatment effectively\nreduced the airway inflammation and secretion of inflammatory factors. Asthma is\na complex disease associated with the interaction between genetic, epigenetic,\nand environmental parameters, involved with a plethora of cells and cellular\nfactors (59). One direction for\ndeveloping new drugs to treat asthma is to target central pathways to the\npathogenesis of the disease, and nucleic acid-mediated therapies silencing the\nspecific effector or the upstream regulator can be a potential approach.\nRibosomal protein S3 (RPS3) was found to bind to the subunit of NF-\u03baB complex\nand enhance the downstream inflammatory effect.

For example,\ndownregulation of miR-20a, 28-3p, 34c-5p, 100, and upregulation of miR-7 and 21\nhave intimate association with COPD development (30). MicroRNAs were also found to play an important role in\nCOPD muscle dysfunction and mass loss (87). Elevated miR-424-5p expression in patients with muscle\nwasting might contribute to the inhibition of protein synthesis and loss of\nmuscle mass (88). It was\ndemonstrated that miR-422a, as a suppressor of TGF-\u03b2 signaling by reducing the\nexpression of SMAD4 protein, might attribute to the maintenance of muscle mass\n(89).",

            "text": "Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a\ngenetic disorder giving rise to the functional failure of the cystic fibrosis\ntransmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) protein, which acts as an epithelial\nchloride channel. The interaction of CFTR and epithelial sodium channel (ENaC)\nis responsible for the homeostasis of the airways epithelial surface. The\ndeficiency or flaw of CFTR leads to hyperactivity of epithelial sodium channel.\nReduced chloride secretion and increased sodium absorption subsequently result\nin mucus dehydration, chronic infection, and airway inflammation (5,90). Using antisense oligonucleotides that correct the basic\ndefect at the mRNA level could restore the crucial balance between ENaC and\nCFTR. A recent study exploited aerosol delivery of ASOs in CF-like mouse models to inhibit ENaC activity by\ntriggering RNase H1-dependent degradation of Scnn1a mRNA, which encodes the ENaC\n\u0251 subunit. This strategy effectively reduced goblet cell hyperplasia and\nreversed CF-like symptoms, demonstrating that\nan ENaC antisense therapy may provide a potential therapy for CF (91). The drug QR-010 is a single-stranded antisense RNA-based\noligonucleotide sequence designed to hybridize the sequences adjacent to the\ndeleted F508 region in the CFTR mRNA to restore the full function of CFTR\nprotein in patients with the F508del mutation. Preliminary studies in cell\nculture and mouse F508del model showed improved chloride efflux after QR-010\ntreatment (92). Data showed that\ntopical administration of QR-010 to the nasal epithelium improved CFTR function\nby measuring the nasal potential difference of F508del CF subjects (93). A\nphase1b study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of\nQR-010 is ongoing in CF patients with\nhomozygous F508del cystic fibrosis.",

The mild form of ARDS\nis termed as acute lung injury (ALI). It is suggested that approximately 2~8\ncases of ARDS per 100,000 population per year. ALI is more common, with rates up\nto 25 per 100,000 per year reported (95). The common risk factors conclude sepsis, trauma,\npneumonia, and toxic inhalation (95). Current ARDS therapy is to improve impaired gas exchange and\nlung mechanics by anti-inflammatory drugs, bronchodilators, and mechanical\nventilation, which show limitation in controlling the disease progression. As\nresearchers digging into the mechanisms of ARDS, crucial regulatory agents\nparticipating in the initiation and progression of ARDS, like miRNAs and\ncytokines, have become appealing therapeutic targets. It was found that murine\nALI models treated with ASOs against miR-155 gained the enhanced recovery of ALI\nas evidenced by the reduction of BAL protein and pro-inflammatory cytokines, and\nthe number of BAL cells (96). NF-\u03baB\nis a family of DNA binding proteins involved in the expression of\npro-inflammatory factors and thus the development of ARDS. Depletion of NF-\u03baB by\nspecific siRNA targeted NF-\u03baB p65 in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI rat\nmodels effectively reduced levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines and\nameliorated symptoms induced by LPS (97). In vivo\nadministration of the siS1PLyase/HMGB1A/R3V6 complex reduced the S1PLyase level\nand weakened the inflammatory response and apoptosis in an LPS-induced ALI\nmodel, indicating that siS1PLyase and HMGB1A have a synergistic therapeutic\neffect for ALI (98).",
