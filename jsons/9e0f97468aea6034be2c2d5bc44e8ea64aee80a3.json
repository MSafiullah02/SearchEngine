            "text": "Here we would like to share our experience of airborne precautions for bedside fiberoptic bronchoscopy examination. The pandemic COVID-19 has become a global threat with 170,0 0 0 confirmed cases globally as of Mar 16, 2020. In China, there were 80,0 0 0 comfirmed cases, in which 3226 were critically ill patients. 3 The mortality rate for the critically ill patients were reported as over 50% by World Health Organization. 4 One key reason might be the difficulty with expectoration of secretions. Autopsy showed that the alveolar cavity of patients with COVID-19 was full of serous and fibrin exudate. 5 The typical pathologic change was clear membrane formation. Methods to decrease retention of secretions in critically ill patients include percussion, a prone position and endotracheal suctioning. However, since endotracheal suction catheters only reach the main bronchus but not the smaller airways, fiberoptic bronchoscopy has been suggested for diagnosis and treatment when necessary. 6 This procedure has been shown to improve respiratory function which can lead to recovery. In addition, a higher rate of confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 was noticed compared using throat swab. 7 Beside the existing value of fiberoptic bronchoscopy in diagnosis and treatment, the potential risk to the health care givers during this procedure should be considered. Aerosol contamination of the environment is increased because the patient's upper respiratory tract is exposed for an extended period. Airborne and contact precautions are critical for the health care team. In addition to strict environmental precautions, decontamination of equipment is another consideration. Tongji Hospital is the largest hospital in central China, and it is a designated center for care of critically ill patients with COVID-19. After the outbreak of the epidemic, two general wards were converted to temporary intensive care units (ICUs) with 72 beds for critical cases of COVID-19 in February 2020.",
