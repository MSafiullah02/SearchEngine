As of July 2007, renovations to the VGH emergency department increased the number of patient beds from 22 to 28 and improved isolation capabilities with sliding doors between most beds. LGH, a 335-bed community hospital, also providing 24-hour emergency services, was renovating the emergency department during the survey and temporarily was without negative pressure ventilation (NPV) or isolation rooms.",

First, the difference in response rates between facilities and occupation groups might have led to disproportionate representation in the results presented. Second, the cross-sectional survey method only evaluates perceptions at 1 point in time, and results are entirely self-reported. Despite these limitations, quantitative and qualitative data presented from the perspective of the algorithms' end-users help identify specific recommendations for improvements to patient safety and occupational health. Further studies may consider incorporating objective outcome measures to accurately estimate use and compliance.",
