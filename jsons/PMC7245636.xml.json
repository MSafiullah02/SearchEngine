On 7th January 2020, a previously unidentified betacoronavirus, later named SARS-CoV-2 virus (or the disease named COVID-19), was identified by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC) as the aetiological agent [1]. The SARS-CoV-2 probably derived originally from bats, and amongst coronaviruses known to infect humans, is most closely related to, but distinct from, the SARS coronavirus. The clinical manifestations of COVID-19 virus infection include asymptomatic infection, mild upper respiratory symptoms, severe viral pneumonia with respiratory failure, and even death. Although the risk of severe illness is not yet clear, hospitals in areas with significant community transmission have experienced a major increase in the number of hospitalized pneumonia patients, with the frequency of severe disease in hospitalized patients being as high as 30% [2\u20134]. The progression from prodromes (usually fever, fatigue, and cough) to severe pneumonia requiring oxygen support, mechanical ventilation, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is most commonly seen in the second week following onset of symptoms of a viral infection [2]. The kinetics of viral replication in the respiratory tract has not been well characterized, but this relatively slow progression provides a potential time window and opportunity for antiviral therapies to influence the course of the disease.",

            "text": "Remdesivir (GS-5734) is a monophosphoramidate prodrug of an adenosine analogue (GS-441524) and has broad action against a range of RNA viruses [5]. It has been identified as the most promising therapeutic agent for evaluation in the treatment of COVID-19 by an expert committee convened by the WHO R&D Blueprint [6]. The primary mechanism of action is the intracellular incorporation of the pharmacologically active nucleoside triphosphate form into nascent RNA chains by the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, causing premature RNA chain termination [7\u20139]. In vitro experiments have shown that remdesivir inhibits bat coronaviruses, endemic human coronavirus (OC43, 229E), and the human pathogenic coronaviruses MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and COVID-19 [10\u201313]. Remdesivir has shown preventive and therapeutic effects in a mouse model of SARS-CoV [10]. In a MERS-CoV mouse model, prophylactic and therapeutic administration of remdesivir improved lung function, decreased lung viral load, and reduced severe lung pathological findings [14]. Remdesivir has also shown prophylactic efficacy in MERS-CoV-infected Indian rhesus monkeys (personal communication: Gilead Sciences, Inc.).",

Further clinical experience was obtained through a randomized controlled trial in patients with Ebola virus disease. In this trial 175 patients received intravenous remdesivir with a loading dose on day 1 (200 mg in adults, and adjusted for body weight in pediatric patients), followed by a daily maintenance dose (100 mg in adults) starting on day 2 and continuing for 9 to 13 days. The only reported serious adverse event (SAE) was that of one patient who experienced hypotension that resulted in cessation of the remdesivir loading dose, followed rapidly by cardiac arrest. However, the cause of death could not be distinguished from the patient\u2019s underlying severe Ebola virus disease [15].",
