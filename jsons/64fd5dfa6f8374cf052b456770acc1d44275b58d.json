Complement system activation can be initiated by three different pathways-classical, alternative, and lectin pathways-resulting in a proteolytic cascade, which culminates in multiple biological processes including opsonization and phagocytosis of intruders, inflammation, cell lysis, and removal of immune complexes and apoptotic cells. Furthermore, it also functions as a link between the innate and adaptive immune responses. The lectin pathway (LP) activation is mediated by serine proteases, termed mannan-binding lectin (MBL)associated serine proteases (MASPs), which are associated with the pattern recognition molecules (PRMs) that recognize carbohydrates or acetylated compounds on surfaces of pathogens or apoptotic cells. These result in the proteolysis of complement C2 and C4 generating C3 convertase (C4b2a), which carries forward the activation cascade of complements, culminating in the elimination of foreign molecules. This chapter presents an overview of the complement system focusing on the characterization of MASPs and its genes, as well as its functions in the immune response.",

The immune system exhibits innate and adaptive responses that cooperate together to facilitate appropriate host defense. Innate immunity provides the first line of defense by recognizing specific patterns present on the surface of microbes (PAMPs, pathogen-associated molecular patterns) or damaged cells (DAMPs, damage-associated molecular patterns) through innate pattern recognition molecules and receptors (PRMs and PRRs, respectively). The effectors of innate immunity include epithelial barriers, phagocytes and natural killer cells, cytokines, and a whole complex of proteins known as the complement system [1, 2] .",

Most of the soluble proteins circulate in functionally inactive forms called proenzymes or zymogens, which share identical domain organization and overall structure, but differ in enzymatic properties and physiological significance in health and disease [1] . Upon proteolytic cleavage, inactive proteins become activated, resulting in a proteolytic cascade that culminates in multiple biological processes such as opsonization and phagocytosis of intruders, inflammation, cell lysis, and removal of immune complexes in addition to being a link between the innate and adaptive immune responses [3] . Furthermore, the complement system plays an important role in the removal of apoptotic cells by recognizing damaged or altered self-components, thereby contributing to tissue homeostasis and preventing autoimmunity [4, 5] . However, excessive complement activation may be deleterious and is associated with tissue damage in certain diseases. Conversely, insufficient activity has also been associated with susceptibility to infection and autoimmune diseases [6] . Complement system is also involved in noninflammatory functions in the brain, such as basal and ischemia-induced neurogenesis [7] and synapse remodeling and pruning [8] . Further, the complement system also interacts with the coagulation system, although the precise molecular mechanism underlying the interaction has not been elucidated [9] .",

The regulatory proteins, both, soluble proteins (such as Factor H and Factor I) and proteins on host cell membranes (such as CR1, CD46, CD55, and CD59) are necessary to ensure that complement activation is not exacerbated or deficient to prevent tissue damage or physiological disorders, respectively [6] .",

            "text": "Complement activation can be initiated by three different pathways: classical, alternative, and lectin pathways [9] . Each pathway is activated by different components that converge in the formation of active enzyme complexes (C3 and C5 convertases), followed by the assembly of the terminal pathway and MAC (C5b-9), which is inserted into to the target cell membrane to lyse the cell. Complement activation also results in the release of chemoattractants (C4a, C3a, and C5a), which are potent inflammatory molecules, and opsonins (C3b and C4b), which mediate phagocytosis ( Fig. 18.1) . Serine proteases play an important role in human physiology and pathology, activating each other to promote initiation and amplification of the complement cascade [10] . They present a common domain containing the catalytic triad of histidine, aspartic acid and serine residues [11] . The serine proteases of the complement system include Clr (85 KDa) and Cls (85 KDa) of the classical pathway (CP), , and alternative pathway (AP). CP typically requires an antigen-antibody complex on pathogen surface and binding to C1 complex (C1q, C1r, and C1s) for its activation. LP recognizes mannose-terminating glycan or acetylated residues on pathogens leading to MBL/ficolins/collectins-MASP complex activation. Both pathways induce the formation of C3 convertase, C4b2a. AP is permanently activated at a low level by spontaneous hydrolysis of C3 into C3(H2O). Lack of complement inhibitors on pathogens induces AP activation by the C3bBb assembly. Complement activation leads to opsonization and phagocytosis of pathogens owing to C3b and C4b deposition, bacterial lysis by C5b-9 complex formation, and inflammation by C4a, C3a, and C5a, leading to recruitment of immune cells, endothelial and epithelial cell activation, and platelet activation (Table 18 .1) [12] .",

In the absence of antibody, C1q can also directly recognize other molecules of the bacterial cell wall, viral envelope membrane, C-reactive protein, etc. [1, 14] . Autocatalytic activation of the serine protease C1r leads to subsequent activation of C1s, that in turn cleaves C4 and C2 into larger (C4b, C2a) and smaller (C4a, C2b) fragments to form the enzyme complex C4bC2a (C3 convertase) [4] . The formation of C3 convertase leads to C3 activation and formation of C3a (anaphylatoxin) and C3b (opsonin), with C3 as the convergence point of the cascade [15] . C3b exposes an internal thioester bond that allows stable covalent binding to hydroxyl groups of any carbohydrates and proteins on the target surface. C3 convertase activity is very efficient, leading to the formation of approximately 1000 molecules of C3b that are able to bind to targets in the vicinity [16] . This process allows pathogens to be recognized as foreign bodies, resulting in phagocytosis and complement activation. Subsequently, additional C3b molecules bind to C3 convertase forming the C5 convertase (C4bC2aC3b) that cleaves C5 in to C5a and C5b, initiating the terminal pathway and assembly of MAC ( Fig. 18 .1) [4, 17] .",

The AP activation occurs on the surface of foreign bodies at a low level by the spontaneous hydrolysis of the internal thioester bond in C3, leading to the formation of C3b analog, C3(H2O). Factor B binds the C3(H2O) and is then cleaved by Factor D, generating a distinct C3 convertase (C3bBb) that further cleaves C3 molecules. In the presence of an activating surface (e.g., a bacterial cell wall), C3b is protected from inactivation by regulatory proteins such as Factors I and H. However, in the AP, a more active C3 convertase (C3bBb) is formed instead, which is further stabilized by properdin. In contrast to other pathways, AP functions as an amplification loop providing a strong positive feedback activation of C3, thereby increasing the production of pro-inflammatory mediators [18] . In fact, 80-90% of pathological complement activation in disease is driven by the AP [19] . Furthermore, the alternative convertase assembly may also be initiated by non-covalent attachment of properdin to some target surfaces ( Fig. 18 .1) [20, 21] .",

This pathway was further characterized by using proteins isolated from rabbit liver and serum; however, its function remained unclear initially [23, 24] . In 1992, Matsushita and Fujita reported that MBL and MASPs activated the LP, which was a landmark study on the mechanism of LP activation [25] . Thus far, 6 different PRMs that initiate the activation of the LP have been identified: 3 ficolins (M-ficolin, L-ficolin, and H-ficolin, also known as ficolin-1, ficolin-2, and ficolin-3, respectively), and 3 collectins (MBL, collectin 11 or collectin kidney-1 or CL-K1, and collectin 10 or colletin-L1or CL-L1). Similar to AP, the LP may be activated in the absence of immune complexes by the binding of PRMs to carbohydrates or acetylated compounds on the surfaces of pathogens (PAMPs) or apoptotic cells (DAMPs) ( Fig. 18 .2). The PRMs form complexes with the serine proteases, MASPs (MASPs [26] [27] [28] . Upon binding of PRM/MASP complexes to appropriate targets, MASPs get activated from pro-enzymes (zymogens) to active forms catalyzing the cleavage of C4 and C2, to generate C3 convertase (C4bC2a), which carries the complement activation cascade forward, culminating in the elimination of microbial intruders by phagocytosis or cells lysis [29] . The terminal pathway occurs in a similar manner in all three activation pathways and results in the assembly of the MAC, initiated by the interaction of C5b with C6 and C7 molecules, yielding the C5bC6C7 (C5b-7) complex. The membrane insertion event is initiated upon binding of C8 to C5b-7 complex. Subsequently, 12-18 copies of C9 molecules bind to the C5b-7, forming the lytic pore (C5b-9) inducing cell death by causing imbalance in cell osmolarity ( Fig. 18 .2) [14, 30] . Multiple MACs are required for complement-mediated lysis of nucleated cells; however, in erythrocytes it has been demonstrated that a single pore could cause cell lysis [31] ( Fig. 18. 3). Newly formed C5b reacts with C6 to form the stable C5b6 complex. Binding of C7 results in a hydrophobic complex that targets the membrane (mC5b-7). Membrane insertion is initiated upon binding of C8 (C5b-8) after which 12-18 copies of C9 polymerize to form the pore-forming ring structure to induce lysis of microbial membranes",

The regulatory domain is followed by the module with the catalytic activity (B-chain), the serine protease (SP) domain [33, 34] . The CCP2 and SP domains are connected through a linker peptide (also termed the activation peptide), where an Arg-Ile bond is cleaved through autolysis when MASP/PRM complexes bind to pathogens, linking the A-and B-chain connected via a disulfide bond [33] . All MASPs are generated from two genes.

MASP-1 and MASP-3 regulatory domains (CUB1-EGF-CUB2-CCP1-CCP2) are encoded by exons 2-8 and exons 10 and 11, while the SP domain is encoded by exons 13-18 and exon 12 in MASP-1 and MASP-3, respectively. MAp44 lacks the SP domain but shares the first four domains (CUB1-EGF-CUB2-CCP) with MASP-1 and MASP-3 that are encoded by exons 2-8. Exon 9 is unique to MAp44 [39, 43] . The mRNA encoding MASP-1 is largely observed in the liver, while mRNA for MASP-3 is primarily observed in the liver and cervix, followed by bladder, brain, colon prostate, and placenta [39] . The highest expression of MAp44 is observed in the heart; it was weakly expressed in cervix, colon, and liver [39] .",

This serine protease plays a central role in the initiation of the LP, by carrying out the activation of MASP-2. It is considered a promiscuous protease since its substrate binding groove is wide and resembles that of trypsin rather than early complement proteases [51] . Recent findings supported MASP-1 as an essential component of the LP, whose concentration is 20-fold higher than MASP-2 in the plasma. MASP-1 undergoes autoactivation to subsequently activate MASP-2 efficiently-acting in a manner analogous to that of C1r and C1s in the CP, being responsible for 60% of the C2 cleaved and C3 convertase formation [52, 53] . MASP-1 autoactivation seems to control the initiation of the LP [54] , but does not cleave C4, being not capable of generating C3 convertase by itself, although direct activation of C3 by MASP-1 can occur at a relatively low efficiency [55, 56] .",

The ancient origin of MASP-1 and its thrombin-like activity suggests its involvement in a coagulation-based defense mechanism in the early evolution of innate immunity [68] . Interestingly, components of the coagulation cascade amplify complement activation in such a manner that both complement and coagulation cascade are interconnected through an important crosstalk [9] .

All the implicated mutations are predicted to damage the SP domain, eliminating the enzymatic activity [49, 75] . According to Venkatraman et al., this disorder is probably a result of structural defects caused by disruption of Ca( 2+ ) binding during biosynthesis of CL-K1, causing structural changes in the protein and in the consequent CL-K1/MASP-3 complexes [76] . In this context, MASP-3 also cleaves IGFBP-5 [73] , regulating physiological processes in kidney, bone, among others, and interestingly, is expressed in the craniofacial region during mouse embryonic development [49] .",

The rs72550870 (T > C) responsible for the Asp > Gly substitution in residue 120 (p.D120G) occurs in the CUB1 domain [82] and affects both MASP-2 and MAp19 leading to a reduced serum concentration by eliminating the binding to MBL and ficolins and affecting complement activation [83] . The MASP-2 levels in heterozygous p.D120G healthy subjects is about half of those in subjects with the wild-type allele [82] . The rs12085877 (G > A) leads to an amino acid substitution (p.R439H) in the MASP-2 serine protease domain leading to a reduction in MASP-2 concentration in heterozygotes. MASP-2 with the p.R439H polymorphism is able to bind to MBL, however, showing reduced enzymatic activity in the MBL-MASP2 complexes [84, 85] . Several other MASP2 polymorphisms, including rs7548659 (G > T) in the promoter region, rs61735600 (C > T) and rs56392418 (G > A) in exon 3, rs2273344(C > T) in intron 4, rs9430347 (T > C) in intron 5, rs17409276 (G > A) in intron 9, rs12711521(C > A) and rs2273346 (A > G) in exon 10, and rs12085877 (C > T) and rs1782455 (G > A) in exon 12, were found to be associated with the modulation of serum levels [84] [85] [86] [87] . Some of them were associated with the susceptibility to leprosy [87] , hepatitis C [88] , malaria [89] , bacterial infections after orthotopic liver transplantation [90] , Chagas disease [91] , rheumatoid arthritis [92] , tuberculosis [93] , rheumatic fever [94] , and endemic pemphigus foliaceus [95] .",

Nevertheless, subsequent analysis demonstrated that despite the homology, MASP-2 was entirely different in assembly and function to C1s [56, 68, 96] with a 1000-fold higher catalytic activity and could be inhibited by C1-inhibitor 50-fold more rapidly [97] . The almost identical substrate specificity of MASP-2 and C1s is mediated through different group of enzyme-substrate interactions, and it is very probable that the major functional difference between them is reflected in the different loop structures of the two enzymes [96] .",

The non-catalytic domain is responsible for the binding of the protease to the recognition molecules, such as MBL. The catalytic domains are responsible for protein conformation and help to ensure the narrow selectivity for protein substrates by restricting access to the substrate binding [36, 56, 96] .
