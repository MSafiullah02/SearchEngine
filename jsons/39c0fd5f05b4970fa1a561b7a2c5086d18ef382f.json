            "text": "Difficulties assessing and predicting the current outbreak of the severe acute respiratory 5 syndrome coronavirus 2 can be traced, in part, to the limitations of a static description of a dynamic 6 system. Fourier transforming the time-domain data of infections and fatalities into the frequency 7 domain makes the dynamics easily accessible. Defining a quantity like the \"case fatality\" as a spectral 8 density allows a more sensible comparison between different countries and demographics during an 9 ongoing outbreak. Such a case fatality informs not only how many of the confirmed cases end up as 10 fatalities, but also when. For COVID-19, knowing this time and using the entire case fatality spectrum 11 allows determining that an outbreak had entered a steady-state (most likely its end) about 14 days 12 before this is obvious from time-domain data. The lag between confirmations and deaths also helps to 13 estimate the effectiveness of contact management: The larger the lag, the less time the average 14 confirmed person had to infect people before quarantine. 15 16 Motive: The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2[1] is currently spreading around the 17 world in an epidemic wave. To fight the epidemic itself as well as to mitigate collateral damage done 18 by mass quarantine measures[2], it is key to assess the situation quickly and accurately. Much 19 information can be already determined during the outbreak, thereby allowing to assess effectivity and 20 necessity of countermeasures. We show here how to gain critical information using only the time series 21 of reported confirmed and fatal cases. 22",

Mainly two 23 numbers are communicated to describe the currently ongoing COVID-19 outbreak: the number of 24 \"confirmed cases\" and the number of \"deaths\" [3]- [5]. The problem is that in a time-dependent 25 situation, each number may change rapidly. It is usually more important to know the timing at which 26 the numbers are reported than the numbers themselves. 27",

(which was not certified by peer review) : medRxiv preprint The fraction of infected persons who end up dying should remain constant, unless radical 31 improvements in treatment happen. This is the infection fatality ratio, an important quantity. If one 32 has a good estimate of the infection fatality ratio in one country, one can estimate the infections in 33 another country from the number of deaths recorded there. However, in an ongoing outbreak, the 34 infection fatality ratio is fundamentally different from dividing the number of deaths that have 35 occurred up to now by the number of infections up to now, because people do not die instantly from 36 the infection. To illustrate this point, we do the following thought experiment: \"A condition is fatal in 37 100 % of the cases. 100 people have acquired the condition by now. How many of them are dead?\" 38 The answer is: Between 0 and 100, depending on when the condition was acquired and how fast it 39 leads to death. The timing is more important than the fatality of the condition. 40 In an ongoing outbreak, we cannot know the actual rate of infections; we can only know the numbers 41 of reported confirmed cases and deaths. To understand a number, one has to understand the question 42 it answers[7]. The number of confirmed cases reported today answers the question: \"In how many 43 cases have people been tested, confirmed positive in a laboratory, with this confirmation having been 44 reported today?\" This question is quite complicated. The number of confirmed cases depends on 45 several factors. The actual number of infected people is only one of them; usually the number of 46 tests[8] and the day of the week are important. The number of deaths answers the question: \"How 47",

A large case fatality lag indicates a low infection quarantine lag, which means the confirmed cases had little time to infect other people before being quarantined.",

We note that even under the simplifying 70 assumptions of no changes in testing, reporting, or treatment of the disease over time, we are left with 71 complicated convolution integrals over the infections, which themselves change exponentially over 72 time. About 200 years ago, Fourier[10] faced the same problem in the description of heat transport, 73 where heat and temperature also change exponentially over time (and space). His work lead to the 74 development of the Fourier transformation, which simplifies the description of a time-dependent 75 phenomenon ( ) by transforming it into a spectral density \u0303( ) in the frequency (f) equation (2) replaces the convolution in the time domain with a simple 78 multiplication in the frequency domain. 79 \u0303( ) =\u0303( )\u0303( ) =\u0303( )\u0303( )\u0303( ) (5) 80 \u0303( ), \u0303( ) and \u0303( ) are the deaths, confirmations, and infections happening at a frequency . \u0303( ), 81 \u0303( ) and \u0303( ) =\u0303( )\u0303( ) are the infection confirmation ratio, the case fatality and the 82 infection fatality, respectively.

We use 7-day floating averages to 143 suppress statistical noise. The most important assumption for the merit of this comparison is that 144 deaths and confirmations behave linearly with respect to each other, i.e., that more confirmations do 145 not lead to a change in case fatality. We call this comparison \"ex. Hubei standard\" and perform it for 146 two places which perform widespread testing and where the outbreaks are more recent: South Korea 147 (seen in fig. 2) and Germany (fig. 3). In summary, the \"ex. Hubei standard\" calculates the number of 148 infected from the number of deceased, using the case fatality of China. 149 For Korea, the ex. Hubei standard shows an increase to a hundred possible confirmations per day 150 around day 25, ca. 10 days before the Koreans actually find and confirm several hundreds of infected 151 each day. When the Koreans do, though, they find more than the Chinese would have in the same time 152 period. This indicates that a few thousand infected people had gone unnoticed for ca. one week, but 153 then the Koreans identified most of them.

            "text": "contact tracing, which means a single confirmation at a time triggers several confirmed 160 contacts soon after. This allows confirmations (and, more importantly, quarantine of infected) to 161 outpace infections, beating exponential growth by faster exponential growth. We note that contact 162 tracing only leads to nonlinearity of the overall response if no new hidden clusters continuously form 163 to be contact-traced later. Nonlinearity is not a good explanation for the discrepancies after day 45, as 164 no surges in confirmations happened after the ex. Hubei standard alleged further possible 165 confirmations in Korea. This would imply Korea having lost most of its capabilities to confirm cases, 166 while still managing to curb the spread of the disease. We consider this unlikely and therefore we 167 search for possible causes for differences in the case fatality. We look at how the case fatality of South 168Korea differs from China ex. Hubei. In South Korea about twice as many people (2.2 \u2022 10 \u22122 compared 169 to 0.9 \u2022 10 \u22122 ) people die after confirmation, but they also die much later than in China.This contradicts 170 what we would expect from either more infections among the risk group or worse health care; in either 171 case more people should die sooner but we observe that more die later. Similarly, false positive 172 confirmations in China cannot explain the observed combination amplitude and lag. A complicated 173 interplay between those factors cannot be ruled out as an explanation without very detailed data. A 174 simpler and therefore better[16] explanation for the observed discrepancy is that China reports only 175 the cases that have certainly died from the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, while 176 South Korea reports everyone who died while not having yet recovered from the virus. A rapid disease 177 progression is characteristic for the severe acute corona virus [14], [17], hence one would expect 178 characteristic cases to die quickly, as they do in China. The risk groups for a severe case of coronavirus 179 infection are elderly people with pre-existing health conditions[17]. These are people with a low 180remaining life expectancy. This means many risk group patients would be expected to die from other 181 causes than the coronavirus before they would have had time to fully recover. It takes three to six 182 weeks for severe cases to recover[18]. For a group of random people with an average life expectancy 183 of 2 years (without CoViD-19 infection) we can estimate that a fraction of 4 \u2022 10 \u22122 of them will die 184 within one month 2 . This makes differentiating between a death from Corona virus and \"random\" death 185 increasingly difficult, the later the death occurs.

The Germans found about 191 1/4 of the cases that the Chinese would have found, provided they reported the same amount of 192 deaths. Since the German timing seems to be very similar to the Chinese (ex. Hubei) it is not surprising 193 that the case fatality amplitude corrected by the lag from China ex. Hubei has fluctuated around a 194 constant of 4.4 \u2022 10 \u22122 since the first death in Germany. By now the spectral averaged case fatality has 195 reached a similar level. This example illustrates the futility of using the instantaneous case fatality 196 ratios as the case fatality amplitude of about 4 \u2022 10 \u22122 in Germany at day 50 was expected when 197 accounting for the lag known from China, while the instantaneous case fatality lay at 0.1 \u2022 10 \u22122 . We 198 note that a day change in the lag would have resulted in an absolute change in estimated case fatality 199 amplitude by 1 \u2022 10 \u22122 at day 50, but now it will only change by 0.1 \u2022 10 \u22122 for a 1 day different lag. We 200 note that at this point, most of the data is still from the rising flank of the outbreak, hence we cannot 201 distinguish if Germany is reporting patients dying very late similarly to Korea or to China, since most 202 late deaths have not occurred yet. While a sizable fraction of deaths has yet to occur in Germany, very 203 little new infections will (provided no major changes are induced in the behaviour of the Germans). 204 This is what the observations of constant spectral case fatality estimates in recent days tell us. Germany 205 is entering a steady-state, as did China on day 25. Since we have observed that the outbreak is 206 Fig. 3. a) Time traces of reported rates of confirmed (blue, left axis) and deaths (red, right axis) in Germany.

The lag allows us to differentiate between 3 testing 237 schemes: Germany and China ex. Hubei have lags on the order of 10 days and few fatalities per case, 238 because they managed to even test many people with mild symptoms relatively soon. Italy and 239 Belgium had restricted testing mainly to suspected cases with severe symptoms. Since severe 240 symptoms are fewer and take ca. 4 days [14] to develop, lags are below 5 days, and case fatalities are 241 several times larger. However, this testing policy has been somewhat consistent throughout the 242 outbreak. Hubei and Iran are the third type of response. Here the lag is negative.
