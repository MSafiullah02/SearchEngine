As of April 20th, 2020, the infection has spread to 210 countries with a total of 2,314,621 confirmed cases and 157,847 deaths worldwide, according to the World Health Organization (WHO) (https://covid19.who.int/). The CoVs are a large family of single-stranded RNA viruses (+ssRNA) that can cross species barriers and cause illnesses in humans ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (1). Coronaviruses were first described in 1966 by Tyrell and Bynoe who named them based on the crown-like morphology of the spherical virion with surface projections that resemble a solar corona. Among the four CoV sub-families (alpha\u2010, beta\u2010, gamma\u2010, and delta\u2010coronaviruses), SARS\u2010CoV\u20102 belongs to the B lineage of beta\u2010CoV and is closely related to the SARS\u2010CoV. The widely reported initial clinical sign for case detection is pneumonia but gastro-intestinal and asymptomatic infections are also being reported in children (2). ",

Asia: the five countries reporting most deaths are Iran (5,118), China (4,636), Turkey (2,017), Indonesia (582) and India (543). America: the five countries reporting most deaths are United States (US) (40,682), Brazil (2,462), Canada (1,580), Mexico (686) and Ecuador (474). Europe: the five countries reporting most deaths are Italy (23,660), Spain (20,453), France (19,718), United Kingdom (16,060) and Belgium (5,683). Oceania: the four countries reporting most deaths are Australia (70), New Zealand (12), Guam (5) and Northern Mariana Islands (2). Interestingly, countries like the US, Spain and Italy have more fatalities than China, the epicentre of the outbreak with a much bigger population. In addition to several factors such as the preparedness of countries like South Korea and Japan due to their earlier fight against SARS and MERS, the emphasis these countries put on developing in vitro diagnostics and therapeutics against the disease (4), co-operation of the public (5), small but significantly contributing factors such as sense of Life Worth Living (Ikigai) in Japan (which actually has been proven to decrease the risk of mortality (6)) etc., which potentially decreased fatalities in these countries compared to Italy, Spain, USA etc., cross-protection against COVID-19 conferred by the encephalitis vaccine also seems to be a key parameter worthy of further investigation. This connection is well illustrated by comparing the large number of fatalities in Italy with the small number of deaths in their neighbouring country, Austria (452 deaths) (3), where, unlike Italy, encephalitis vaccination is included in its national immunization schedule (7). This hypothesis is further supported by several additional reports. ",

            "text": "Viral-induced encephalitis is associated with four different kinds of viruses i. Arboviruses (e.g., eastern equine encephalitis, Japanese encephalitis (JE), La Crosse encephalitis, St. Louis encephalitis, western equine encephalitis, West Nile virus encephalitis), ii. Enteroviruses (e.g., coxsackievirus, polioviruses), iii. Herpes viruses and iv. Other viruses such as measles, mumps, and rubella, which cause secondary encephalitis (8). Of these, JE is the leading cause of viral encephalitis worldwide, with an estimated 50,000 cases and 15,000 deaths annually. It is a member of the genus Flavivirus, which also includes the dengue, yellow fever and West Nile viruses and is transmitted by Culex mosquitoes. In northern Europe and northern Asia, flaviviruses causing encephalitis have evolved to use ticks as vectors because of their abundance in cooler climates and hence the encephalitis caused by flavivirus is termed tick-borne encephalitis (9). It is interesting to note that CoVs, though primarily recognized as respiratory pathogens, are also encephalitis-inducing infectious agents; especially, HCoV-229E, HCoV-OC43, and SARS-CoV, which possess neuroinvasive properties and their viral RNA has been detected in human brains. A few years after the 2002-2003 SARS-CoV epidemics, associated viral particles were identified in the brain tissue of infected individuals with central nervous system (CNS) issues associated with oedema, neurodegeneration, and gliosis. The viruses accessed the brain through the olfactory bulbs, where they infected neuronal cells, and induced a lethal disease in an area of the body with restrained immune infiltration (8). Immunization with inactivated JE vaccine (INV) and live attenuated vaccine (LAV) induces a cross-immune response that confers cross-protection against dengue viruses (DENVs) (10). Tripartite motif-containing (TRIM) proteins are active players in antiviral innate immunity and overlapping molecular determinants govern the antiviral activities of TRIM56 against infections by yellow fever virus (YFV), dengue virus serotype 2 (DENV2) and human CoV (HCoV-OC43) (11). The neuroinvasive properties of SARS-CoV2 may also underlie respiratory failure in patients with COVID-19 (12). Furthermore, a case of meningitis was recently attributed to COVID-19 in Japan (13).",
