Unlike DNA viruses, RNA viruses lack the ability to detect and repair mistakes during replication [1] and, as a result, their mutation rate can be as high as 1 mutation per each 1,000-100,000 bases copied per replication cycle [2]. Many of the mutations are well tolerated and passed down to descendants, producing a family of co-existing related variants of the original viral genome referred to as quasispecies, a concept that originally described a mutation-selection balance [3-7].",

Millions of single-stranded fragments are sequenced by synthesizing their complementary strands. Repeatedly, nucleotide reagents are flown over the fragments, one nucleotide (A, C, T, or G) at a time. Light is emitted at a fragment location when the flown nucleotide base complements the first unpaired base of the fragment [13,14]. Multiple identical nucleotides may be incorporated in a single cycle, in which case the light intensity corresponds to the number of incorporated bases. However, since the number of incorporated bases (referred to as a homopolymer length) cannot be estimated accurately for long homopolymers, it results in a relatively high percentage of insertion and deletion sequencing errors (which respectively represent 65%-75% and 20%-30% of all sequencing errors [15,16]).",

In particular, due to the lower mutation rate and longer conserved regions, HCV quasispecies are harder to reconstruct than quasispecies of HBV and HIV. Additionally, the QSR problem is made difficult by the limited read length and relatively high error rate of high throughput sequencing data generated by current technologies.",

As noted above, de novo assembly methods are designed to reconstruct a single genome sequence, and are not well-suited for reconstructing a large number of closely related quasispecies sequences. Haplotype assembly does seek to reconstruct two closely related haplotype sequences, but existing methods do not easily extend to the reconstruction of a large (and a priori unknown) number of sequences. Computational methods developed for population phasing deal with large numbers of haplotypes, but rely on the availability of genotype data that conflates information about pairs of haplotypes. Metagenomic samples do consist of sequencing reads generated from the genomes of a large number of species. However, differences between the genomes of these species are considerably larger than those between viral quasispecies. Furthermore, existing tools for metagenomic data analysis focus on species identification, as reconstruction of complete genomic sequences would require much higher sequencing depth than that typically provided by current metagenomic datasets.",

Mapping based approaches to QSR are naturally preferred to de novo assembly since reference genomes are available (or easy to obtain) for viruses of interest, and viral genomes do not contain repeats. Thus, it is not surprising that such approaches were adopted in the two pioneering works on the QSR problem [24,25]. Eriksson et al. [24] proposed a multi-step approach consisting of sequencing error correction via clustering, haplotype reconstruction via chain decomposition, and haplotype frequency estimation via expectation-maximization, with validation on HIV data. In Westbrooks et al. [25], the focus is on haplotype reconstruction via transitive reduction, overlap probability estimation and network flows, with application to simulated error-free HCV data. Recently, the QSR software tool ShoRAH was developed [26] and applied to HIV data [27]. Another combinatorial method for QSR was also developed and applied to HIV and HBV data in [28], with results similar to those of ShoRAH. Our contributions in this paper are as follows:",
