The trafficking of CXCR4and CCR5-expressing leukocytes occurs in a wide range of diseases with diverse etiologies that affect a variety of tissue sites, including the central nervous system (CNS) . Because most antiretroviral therapies are unable to efficiently cross the blood-brain barrier (Boffito et al. 2006) , the CNS retains special status as a potential viral reservoir during HIV-1 infection. It is therefore imperative to consider how targeting HIV-1 coreceptors impacts on leukocyte trafficking into the CNS, as it could influence the incidence, progression and severity of advanced HIV-1 infection, including the development of HIV-1-associated neurological diseases. For example, as HIV-1-infected immune cells are believed to bring virus in to the CNS (Fischer-Smith and Rappaport 2005) , enhancement of leukocyte trafficking into the CNS could lead to increases in CNS viral replication and dissemination. Alternatively, increased parenchymal entry of immune cells might promote the induction of demyelinating disease via enhanced entry of myelin specific T cells into the CNS (Hellings et al. 2002; Holz et al. 2000; Lunemann et al. 2004; Muraro et al. 2002) . Additionally, the prevention of leukocyte trafficking by receptor antagonism could lead to increased susceptibility to lethal opportunistic infection, as was observed in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients treated with natalizumab, a humanized monoclonal antibody against a4-integrin, an adhesion molecule shown to be essential for the migration of leukocytes into the CNS (Adelman et al. 2005) .

The coordination of this movement begins in the secondary lymphoid tissue where leukocytes are primed with information regarding antigen specificity, become activated, and up-regulate molecules that can direct their infiltration into specific target tissues. The general sequence of events leading to leukocyte entrance into inflamed tissue is a well-defined process involving selectins, integrins and chemokines (Butcher and Picker 1996) . The first step in this sequence involves a family of molecules that bind sialylated carbohydrates known as selectins, which are expressed on the activated endothelium and mediate the \"capture and rolling\" of lymphocytes along the vascular wall. The rolling motion of a lymphocyte is converted to firm adhesion by the combined action of integrins and chemokines. Integrins are expressed by lymphocytes, and endothelial cells express their carbohydrate ligands. Integrins undergo conformational changes in response to activation of G-protein-coupled chemokine receptors, which are also expressed by trafficking lymphocytes (Johnston and Butcher 2002; Springer 1994) . Chemokine ligands, which comprise a large family of proteins that generally direct lymphocyte extravasation into tissues, thus accomplish directed homing of lymphocytes. Although the molecular patterns required to enable trafficking from the circulation into the CNS are incompletely understood, three important molecules, intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1 (Laschinger and Engelhardt 2000) , and P-selectin (Piccio et al. 2002) appear to play essential roles in this process. ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and P-selectin are all expressed by activated endothelial cells during induction of disease or by treatment with the inflammatory mediators tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-a), CD40 ligand (CD40L), lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and IL-1b (Ubogu et al. 2006) . After the CNS endothelium is activated, the expression of P-selection and ICAM-1 mediate the capture of circulating T cells through interactions with P-selectin glycolipid (PSGL)-1, and lymphocytefunction-associated antigen (LFA)-1 (integrin aLb2), respectively (Biernacki et al. 2001; Bullard et al. 2007; Piccio et al. 2002) .

The BBB is comprised of a network of various cell types and modifications that contribute to maintaining its immune-privilege status including endothelial cells joined by tight junctions, their encasement by pericyte-embedded basement membranes and an additional barrier comprised of glial cell foot-processes. These modifications create an additional area through which leukocytes must exit to gain parenchymal entry known as the perivascular space, which is unique to the CNS (Ballabh et al. 2004) . Under normal conditions, this formidable barrier is effective at limiting the trafficking of leukocytes from the blood into the CNS parenchyma. However, when the BBB is compromised, immune cells are able to gain access to the CNS. The extent of BBB penetration and leukocyte entrance depends upon disease etiology (Frohman et al. 2006) . Despite differences in the extent of parenchymal entry during infectious or autoimmune diseases, infiltrating leukocytes first accumulate in the perivascular spaces. The perivascular infiltrate is therefore the cardinal lesion associated with all neuroinflammatory diseases. Control of immune infiltration of the CNS poses a unique dichotomy in which its limitation is greatly desired for the treatment of MS, but might also be detrimental during infectious disease where leukocytes are required to clear pathogens. Understanding the specific mechanisms regulating the trafficking of leukocytes across the blood-brain barrier is therefore paramount in developing therapies that prevent or promote inflammation within the CNS.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 138, "end": 156, "text": "(Lucas et al. 2006", "ref_id": "BIBREF83"}, {"start": 638, "end": 659, "text": "(Ballabh et al. 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 976, "end": 997, "text": "(Frohman et al. 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Leukocyte Trafficking into the CNS"}, {"text": "The HIV-1 coreceptors CXCR4 and CCR5 bind to ligand members of a family of molecules known as chemokines, or chemotactic cytokines.

CXCR4 is also expressed constitutively throughout the CNS and can be found on endothelial cells, oligodendrocytes, microglia, and neurons (Klein and Rubin 2004) . In the absence of inflammation, CXCL12 and CXCR4 direct the movement and proliferation of and recognition between a variety of resident neural cells types during CNS development (Lu et al. 2002; Pujol et al. 2005; Stumm et al. 2003) . Neurophysiologic roles for these molecules in the adult CNS have not been established. During inflammatory conditions, however, expression of CXCL12 is altered (McCandless et al. 2006; McCandless et al. 2008a) , suggesting that its role in the CNS is not limited to a developmental one. Because CXCR4 is ubiquitously expressed on leukocytes, it is likely that BBB expression of CXCL12 affects the trafficking of leukocytes, including CD4+, CD8+ T cells and macrophages (Bleul et al. 1996b; Klein and Rubin 2004) . Much of the work studying inflammatory-induced CXCL12 has been done in the context of autoimmune neuroinflammation, such as MS and its murine model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), during which endothelial cells, neurons, microglia, and astrocytes have all been shown to increase their expression of CXCL12 (Ambrosini et al. 2005; Calderon et al. 2006; Krumbholz et al. 2006; McCandless et al. 2006; McCandless et al. 2008a ). In compliment, increased numbers of CXCR4-expressing T cells and macrophages traffic to and infiltrate the CNS during MS, leading to demyelination and neuronal injury (Frohman et al. 2006; Prat and Antel 2005) . More recent studies have examined the roles of CXCL12 and CXCR4 during encephalitis due to neurotropic viruses, such as the West Nile virus (WNV) and in the context of neuroAIDS (Langford et al. 2002; McCandless et al. 2008b; Peng et al. 2006) .

Consistent with this, CCR5 has been detected on HIV-infected macrophages within both the CNS and the peripheral blood in individuals with advanced disease.

The overall frequency of CCR5-expressing perivascular macrophages was positively correlated with severity of HIV-1-induced neurologic disease, whereas the frequency of CXCR4-expressing macrophages did not correlate with disease severity (Vallat et al. 1998 ). CCR5 expression was also significantly enhanced in HIV-1-specific CD8 T cells taken from cerebrospinal fluid versus peripheral blood of HIV-infected patients without neurologic disease (Shacklett et al. 2004) . Ligands for these receptors (CXCL12, CCL2, -3, -5) were found to be expressed by activated astrocytes (Peng et al. 2006; Sanders et al. 1998) , suggesting that turnover of macrophages may increase during neuroinflammatory states. Characterization of chemokine receptors found on T lymphocytes and monocytes in brain sections from subjects with various neuroinflammatory diseases, however, revealed that CCR1 and CCR5 are present on perivascular and parenchymal monocytic cells whereas only CCR5 was present on parenchymal macrophages (Trebst et al. 2003) . These findings suggest that CCR5-expressing mononuclear cells, macrophages, and microglia contribute to progression of neurologic disease of individuals with AIDS by promoting virus entry and replication within the CNS. As CCR5 was also found to be expressed by normal microglia in nonencephalitis brain specimens, this receptor may play a role in the physiologic turnover of these cells, although this remains a topic of much debate (Ajami et al. 2007; Mildner et al. 2007 ). Using a coculture of endothelial cells and astrocytes that models several aspects of the human blood-brain barrier, Weiss et al. (1999) examined the mechanism whereby the HIV-derived factor Tat, a protein that activates viral gene expression (Deng et al. 2002) , may facilitate monocyte transmigration. HIV-1 Tat induced significant expression of CCL2 by astrocytes and upregulated expression of CCR5 on human monocytes (Weiss et al. 1999) . Although they demonstrated that transmigration across an in vitro BBB model could be inhibited by antiCCL2 antibodies, others have shown that antiCCR5 and antiCCR1 also both abrogate monocyte migration in similar models suggesting that a variety of inflammatory processes could augment monocyte migration into the CNS (Ubogu et al. 2006 ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 390, "end": 413, "text": "(Bonwetsch et al. 1999;", "ref_id": "BIBREF23"}, {"start": 414, "end": 434, "text": "Sanders et al. 1998;", "ref_id": "BIBREF133"}, {"start": 435, "end": 453, "text": "Vallat et al. 1998", "ref_id": "BIBREF162"}, {"start": 694, "end": 713, "text": "(Vallat et al. 1998", "ref_id": "BIBREF162"}, {"start": 902, "end": 925, "text": "(Shacklett et al. 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF139"}, {"start": 1030, "end": 1048, "text": "(Peng et al. 2006;", "ref_id": "BIBREF121"}, {"start": 1049, "end": 1069, "text": "Sanders et al. 1998)", "ref_id": "BIBREF133"}, {"start": 1462, "end": 1482, "text": "(Trebst et al. 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF159"}, {"start": 1919, "end": 1938, "text": "(Ajami et al. 2007;", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1939, "end": 1958, "text": "Mildner et al. 2007", "ref_id": "BIBREF103"}, {"start": 2078, "end": 2097, "text": "Weiss et al.

Within these infiltrates, CCR5 localized specifically to cells within microglial nodules Westmoreland et al. 1998) . This model has further demonstrated that CCR5 expression on blood monocytes and brain microglia and/ or macrophages distinguishes animals that develop encephalitis from those that do not (Marcondes et al. 2008) .

Because IL-15 treatment of acute SIV infection of rhesus macaques also led to an increase in the viral set point and acceleration of disease, the authors speculated that the decreased percentages of peripheral CCR5-expressing CD4+ T cells might indicate that the trafficking of these cells into tissue increases infection. Interestingly, one of the IL-15-treated animals developed neuropathological signs of early SIV encephalitis with increased mononuclear cell infiltrates and parenchymal microglial nodules, suggesting that increased expression of CCR5 on virally infected mononuclear cells promotes viral entry and neuropathology (Mueller et al. 2008 ).", "cite_spans": [{"start": 487, "end": 512, "text": "Westmoreland et al. 1998)", "ref_id": "BIBREF170"}, {"start": 702, "end": 725, "text": "(Marcondes et al. 2008)", "ref_id": "BIBREF89"}, {"start": 887, "end": 907, "text": "(Mueller et al. 2008", "ref_id": "BIBREF107"}, {"start": 1710, "end": 1730, "text": "(Mueller et al. 2008", "ref_id": "BIBREF107"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Macaque Model"}, {"text": "MS, a chronic demyelinating disease of the CNS, is the most common cause of nontraumatic disability among young adults (Frohman et al. 2006) .

Clinically, MS is characterized by variations in the progression of disease over time, which has led to three clinical classifications of the disease. Relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS), the most common presenting form of MS, is a stable condition interrupted by recurrent attacks of temporary neurological disability. RRMS often evolves into secondary-progressive MS (SPMS), in which patients no longer remit but rather progressively deteriorate and accrue neurological disability. Primary-progressive MS (PPMS) follows a continuously declining course beginning at disease onset. In MS, it is generally accepted that acute inflammatory lesions begin with breakdown of the BBB (McFarland and Martin 2007), leading to the formation of perivascular infiltrates of mononuclear cells, parenchymal penetration by myelin-specific T cells, and subsequent recruitment and activation of monocytes/microglia that cause demyelination and axonal damage (Hauser et al. 1986; Huseby et al. 2001; Prat and Antel 2005; Ransohoff et al. 2003) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 119, "end": 140, "text": "(Frohman et al. 2006)", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 1347, "end": 1367, "text": "(Hauser et al. 1986;", "ref_id": "BIBREF69"}, {"start": 1368, "end": 1387, "text": "Huseby et al. 2001;", "ref_id": "BIBREF74"}, {"start": 1388, "end": 1408, "text": "Prat and Antel 2005;", "ref_id": "BIBREF124"}, {"start": 1409, "end": 1431, "text": "Ransohoff et al. 2003)", "ref_id": "BIBREF128"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "CNS Autoimmunity"}, {"text": "A variety of proinflammatory chemokines, including ligands of both CXCR4 and CCR5, are detected within the CNS of individuals with autoimmune neuroinflammatory diseases.

In normal CNS tissues CXCL12b expression occurs along the abluminal surfaces of CNS endothelial cells where leukocytes, which ubiquitously express the receptor CXCR4, engage it when attempting to enter the CNS. The polarized expression of CXCL12b acts to localize mononuclear cells to perivascular spaces during neuroinflammation, thereby limiting their entry into the CNS parenchyma. This subcompartment retention, which is analogous to the role of CXCL12b in lymphoid compartments, could be an integral component of CNS protection from the pathologic consequences of lymphocyte-induced glial cell activation. Consistent with this, in both humans and mice with CNS autoimmune disease, BBB expression of CXCL12b increases and relocates across the inflamed venules, allowing the egress of leukocytes from CNS perivascular spaces into the parenchyma, leading to glial activation and demyelination.

While autoreactive CD4+ and CD8+ T cells have been shown to play roles in CNS demyelinating diseases in murine models, gd T cells have recently come to the forefront as important participants in the initial induction of EAE (Lees et al. 2008; Odyniec et al. 2004; Smith and Barnum 2008; Szalai and Barnum 2004; Szalai et al. 2005) . Interestingly, gd TCR+T cell lines derived from MS patients, compared to lines derived from healthy control subjects, expressed lower levels of CCR5 but higher levels of ligand (CCL5), suggesting the presence of an autoregulatory loop (Murzenok et al. 2002) . Additional CCL3 and CCR5 expressing cells present within MS lesions are foamy macrophages and activated microglia (Balashov et al. 1999; Simpson et al. 2000; Sorensen et al. 1999) . In a study by Trebst et al. (2003) , 70% of CSF CD14+ monocytes derived from MS patients during exacerbations were found to express CCR1 and CCR5, regardless of the stage of disease, versus <20% of circulating monocytes. CCR1/ CCR5 expressing monocytes were found in perivascular infiltrates and at demyelinating edges of lesions. While early lesions contained CCR1/CCR5-expressing monocytes and CCR1/CCR5 negative microglia, those examined at later stages contained macrophages that expressed only CCR5. The authors suggest that a subset of CCR1+/CCR5+ blood monocytes traffic into the CNS where, in the presence of ligands they are retained and, which upon further activation, down-regulates CCR1 and upregulates CCR5. A recent study identified four patterns of demyelination in active MS lesions. In all four of these patterns, infiltrating monocytes coexpress CCR1 and CCR5. The characteristics of pattern II lesions suggested a primary inflammatory mechanism of myelin injury, while pattern III lesions showed features consistent with oligodendrocyte degeneration. In pattern II lesions, the number of cells expressing CCR1 significantly decreased while CCR5 increased in late active compared with early active demyelinating regions. In striking contrast, numbers of cells expressing CCR1 and CCR5 were equal in all regions of pattern III lesions (Mahad et al. 2004) . Support for the role of CCR5 in the trafficking of CD4 T cells and macrophages during CNS autoimmunity also comes from studies using viral models of demyelination. Intracranial infection of the coronavirus mice with mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) results in an immune response-mediated demyelinating disease that serves as another model MS. During MHV-induced demyelination, CD4+ T cells amplify demyelination by attracting macrophages into the CNS following viral infection by mechanisms that are not yet understood. In studies using mice with targeted deletion of CCR5, virus-specific CD4+ T cells were unable to traffic into the CNS which led to higher CNS viral titers early during infection (Glass and Lane 2003b) . CCR5 is not, however, required for the trafficking of virus-specific CD8+ T cells in this model as there were no differences in trafficking patterns of CCR5\u2212/\u2212 CD8+ T cells. On the contrary, loss of CCR5 led to increased activity of virus-specific, cytotoxic CD8 T cells and eventual viral clearance that was no different from wildtype mice (Glass and Lane 2003a) .

During relapse, CD4 and CD8 cells within the CSF are enriched for CCR5 while during remission, CCR5 alone is reduced in CSF CD4 T cells suggesting that CCR5 expression on those particular cells is a marker of disease activity (Misu et al. 2001) . Treatment with immunosuppressive drugs alters the numbers of CCR5expressing T cells in the periphery. Both cyclophosphamide and glatiramer therapy, for example, reverse the increase in the percentages of IFN-g-producing CCR5 expressing T cells in MS patients (Allie et al. 2005; Karni et al. 2004 ). In addition, treatment with methylprednisolone can decrease the percentages of CCR5-expressing CD4 T cells in the peripheral blood (Martinez-Caceres et al. 2002a ).

In addition, administration of a CXCR4 antagonist early in the course of CNS infection led to increased parenchymal penetration of WNV-specific CD8+ T cells, enhanced viral clearance and improved survival from 10 to 50%. Interestingly, the augmented numbers of infiltrating CD8+ T cells was associated with decreased glial cell activation, suggesting that T cell entry into the CNS for the purpose of viral clearance does not necessarily lead to inappropriate immune activation and pathology.

One group has now published two reports that associate deficiency of CCR5 with symptomatic WNV infection. In one report, which examined WNV infection and carriage of CCR5D32 in cohorts of patients from Colorado and Arizona, loss of CCR5 was associated with increased neuroinvasive disease (Glass et al. 2006) . In a metaanalysis of the Colorado and Arizone cohorts plus two additional cohorts from Illinois and California, homozygosity for the CCR5D32 allele was found to be higher in patients with symptomatic WNV infection (Lim et al. 2008) . The discrepancy in the severity of WNV infection associated with CCR5D32 homozygosity between the two studies was blamed on underpowering as the small sample sizes were unable to show such an association for a gene found in populations of European descent with allelic frequencies ranging from 0 to 0.29 (McNicholl et al. 1997 ). In addition, neither study demonstrated any impact of CCR5D32 homozygosity on age incidence in symptomatic, WNV-infected patients. Depicted are proposed models for CXCL12-mediated regulation of T cell egress from perivascular spaces in the context of autoimmune and WNV encephalitides. In autoimmune disease, CXCR4-expressing T cells express the cytokine IL-1b (McCandless et al., 2009) , which binds its receptor, IL-1R, on endothelial cells. This induces the intracellular uptake of CXCL12 via unknown mechanisms, allowing T cells to exit from the perivascular space. In the case of WNV encephalitis, IL-1b is not expressed within the CNS (Cheeran et al. 2005; Kong et al. 2008 ) and T cells remain localized to perivascular spaces until late in the course of disease when CXCL12 levels are down-regulated and T cells begin to enter the parenchyma (McCandless et al. 2008b) Carriage of the CCR5D32 allele, however, may be a risk factor for severe infections with flaviviruses, in general. Kindberg et al. (2008) performed CCR5D32 genotyping among Lithuanian patients with tick-borne encephalitis (TBE), an often fatal infection caused by the TBE flavivirus (TBEV). As with WNV, TBEV in most individuals induces a self-limited, febrile illness with influenza-like symptoms while certain individuals, for unknown reasons, develop severe meningoencephalitis. In the Kindberg study, a significant increase in CCR5D32 allele prevalence was observed in patients with TBE compared with nonTBE aseptic meningoencephalitis subjects and healthy subjects were seronegative for TBE. Carriage of the CCR5D32 allele was also associated with increased clinical severity of disease, although individuals with CCR5D32 were not members of the group with the most severe symptoms (Kindberg et al. 2008) .

If CCR5 antagonism does prove to be efficacious for the prevention of neuroAIDS, based on the virologic studies in animal models described above, its use would not be recommended if alternative immunotherapeutic agents that promote CD8 T cell-mediated clearance of HIV-1 were developed and implemented. Therefore, use of CCR5 antagonists will need to be continually reevaluated through animal model experimentation as novel therapeutic targets emerge and are translated into new drug treatments for HIV-infected patients.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusions"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF0": {"ref_id": "b0", "title": "T-cell properties determine disease site, clinical
