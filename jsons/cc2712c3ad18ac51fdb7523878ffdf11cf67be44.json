Because university sustainability depends upon the enrollment and retention of students, the effective integration of ICT plays a critical role in maintaining a competitive advantage. Previous research has discussed both the external and internal barriers that affect the process of technology integration, such as resources, training, and personal attitudes (Ertmer 1999; Nura et al. 2011) . Research also advocates technology integration with pedagogical practices, rather than merely teaching certain technologies (Wang et al. 2014; Ambrose et al. 2010) . While the examination of processes and outcomes of technology integration from faculty members' perspectives is critical, Stensaker et al. (2007) highlighted the importance of toplevel administrator support for organization-wide technology integration initiatives. Professional development organizations are often the best equipped to implement technology initiatives. However, there is a lack of empirical evidence as to whether current professional development centers (PDCs) are providing optimal technology training initiatives for their faculty and students. This study articulates the PDC leaders' opinions about and their first-hand experiences in improving the technology integration process by addressing the following key research questions: First, how are information & communication technologies employed at flagship university professional development centers? Secondly, what are the barriers to implementing information and communication technologies at flagship universities?", "cite_spans": [{"start": 165, "end": 187, "text": "(Stensaker et al. 2007", "ref_id": "BIBREF44"}, {"start": 550, "end": 563, "text": "(Ertmer 1999;", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 564, "end": 581, "text": "Nura et al. 2011)", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 708, "end": 726, "text": "(Wang et al. 2014;", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 727, "end": 747, "text": "Ambrose et al. 2010)", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 872, "end": 895, "text": "Stensaker et al.

The role of a flagship university is one that often meets world-class university standards as defined by the leading ranking systems.

Many HEIs are utilizing technology as one of the key initiatives in their professional development programs. However, current literature indicates various purposes for and ways of using technology by different institutions. Studies show that technology integration strategies differ across disciplines and curricular domains (Eynon 2005; Hsu et al. 2013) . For example, Eynon (2005) found that the most common use of technology within higher education institutions was to provide students with a range of online resources. She also examined other academic motivations, such as enhancing the educational experience for students; compensating the changes happening in higher education, such as the increasing student numbers and demand for flexible learning opportunities; and personal interests and enjoyment. In contrast, other studies have found that the majority of teachers still use technology passively as a \"learn-from\" medium (Wang et al. 2014; Siefert et al. 2019) . Bigum (2002) described this passive adoption of technology practices as \"domesticating\" the computer in classrooms.

After examining eight world-class universities' faculty development centers, Jacob et al. (2015) concluded that instead of merely applying technology for its own sake, higher education institutions should implement technology to enhance teaching and learning endeavors. Further, Albion et al. (2015) argue that the integration of technology can be the educational innovation (as opposed to solely supporting or enhancing an existing endeavor). Some innovative pedagogical practices require teachers to implement technology to create an environment that supports learners' cognitive processes in problemsolving. These cognitive processes can provide learners a variety of critical, creative, and complex thinking opportunities (Wang et al. 2014 ). Ertmer and Ottenbreit-Leftwich's (2013) study suggested that the ultimate instructional and learning goal is to engage students in authentic problem-solving through the support of technology, rather than merely integrating technology into classrooms. Prestridge (2010b) concluded that ICT professional development should move from infrequent technology integration within a curriculum to a model that enables teachers to see the transforming potential of ICT, which is to integrate technology in promoting students' substantive cognitive learning and problem-solving competencies.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 208, "end": 221, "text": "Becker (1994)", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 404, "end": 423, "text": "Jacob et al.

Digital literacy includes teachers' broad views of the information era and consideration of constructing technology teaching models (Krumsvik 2008 ). The gap between research outcomes and technology usage in teaching is a result of the lack of transformation. This gap can also be described in terms of the relationship between research and practice or the complement between theoretical knowledge and experiential knowledge. For decades, there have been debates about the relationship between research and practice in education (Bereiter 2014) . As a relatively new element of teaching, computer technology integration can be a driving force behind pedagogical innovation (Kozma and Vota 2014) . Recent theoretical research and case studies suggest that the combination of research and practice is the optimal way to fill this gap between research outcomes and technology usage in teaching (Guri-Rosenblit 2002; Bereiter 2014) .

Nura et al. (2011) surveyed 312 higher education institution members of staff in Sokoto state, Nigeria, about their acceptance of the adoption of technology in human resource management. Results showed that when education professionals believe using technology will increase their effectiveness and job performance, they are more likely to put effort into learning about that technology. Palak and Walls (2009) found that even in those schools with rich technology, teachers' strong traditional beliefs impeded the use of technology in teaching and learning. Therefore, examining teachers' inner drive to implement technology and how higher education institutions help to stimulate teachers' inner drive is crucial to implementing ICT in education. Little and Housand (2011) stated that support from school administration can ensure sufficient time and resources devoted to a professional development initiative. Albion et al.

Few of the reviewed research studies examined how a central professional development organization or programs can provide guidance in the process of implementing ICT.
