In particular, for predator-prey ecosystems, infectious diseases coupled with predator-prey interaction to produce a complex combined effect as regulators of predator and prey sizes. In many ecological studies of predator-prey systems with disease, it is reported that the predators take a disproportionately high number of parasite-infected prey (e.g. Van Dobben, 1952; Vaughn & Coble, 1975; Temple, 1987) . Some studies have even shown that parasite could change the external features or behaviour of the prey so that infected prey are more vulnerable to predation (see, e.g. Mech, 1970; Holmes & Bethel, 1972; Schaller, 1972; Krebs, 1978; Dobson, 1988; Peterson & Page, 1988; Moore, 248 Y.-H.

They discovered several interesting cases where the disease infection in prey could promote coexistence. For example, under certain parameter values, the greater vulnerability of the infected prey allows the predator population to persist when it would otherwise become extinct. Moreover, there is a case where predation on the more vulnerable prey can cause the disease to die out when it would remain endemic without the predators.",

            "text": "Most of these previous studies focussed mainly on parasite infection and in prey only, although some studies did consider infection of predator through eating prey (e.g. Anderson & May, 1986; Hadeler & Freedman, 1989; Venturino, 1994) or spread of disease in the predators (Venturino, 2002) . Venturino (2001) also studied the dynamics of two competing species when one of them is subject to a disease, but the disease cannot cross the species barrier. However, the recent outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and animal-to-human transmission of avian influenza (H5N1) demonstrated the possibility of infectious disease caused by a microorganism crossing the species barrier between different species by enlarging its host range (Klempner & Shapiro, 2004) , including that of between prey and predator populations. Klempner & Shapiro (2004) made further distinction between what they termed as 'small step to man' and 'giant leap to mankind'. The former describes a minor alteration in the microorganism's host range resulting in intermittent human infections without human-to-human transmission as in the 1997 H5N1 avian influenza outbreak that occurred in Hong Kong that results in six fatal cases including young infants (Meslin et al., 2001) , while the latter describes the dreaded scenario of pandemic spread of the disease among humans (e.g. the feared human-to-human transmissible mutation of H5N1 leading to a global avian influenza pandemic). The recent SARS coronavirus presents a 'middle ground' of the two extremes crossing from animals to human host with limited (or inefficient) human-to-human transmission. The potential threat of an influenza pandemic also led to recent interest in scientific research to understand how and why some pathogens become capable of crossing host species barriers (Kuiken et al., 2006) . Hadeler & Freedman (1989) had previously studied a predator-prey model with parasite infection where the disease is allowed to cross the species barrier. Moreover, assuming that the predators could get infected by eating prey and the prey could obtain the disease from parasites spread into the environment by predators, they obtained a threshold condition above which an endemic equilibrium or an endemic periodic solution could arise in the case where there is coexistence of the predator with the uninfected prey. Furthermore, they also showed that in the case where the predator cannot survive only on the prey in a disease-free environment, the parasitization could lead to persistence of the predator since the predators could only survive on the prey if some of the prey were more easily captured due to being diseased, provided a certain threshold for disease transmission is surpassed.",

On the contrary, the present model includes the possibility (case 5) of a highly infectious disease (R 0 > R * 0 > 1) driving the predators to extinction when the predators and prey would have coexisted without the disease (R 1 > 1), which further highlights the possibly damaging role played by a disease that infects both predators and prey.

For control of avian influenza epidemic in birds, vaccination has been suggested as an option for the prevention of bird infections (Lee & Suarez, 2005) and is being used by some countries like China on a historically massive scale in an attempt to prevent a potentially massive influenza pandemic (Cyranoski, 2005) . However, the present difficulty in implementation, risks and delays involved in a massive bird vaccination program made it considerably less efficient and effective as an option for prevention (Normile, 2004) . It has even been suggested that a possible source of the continuing H5N1 pandemic threat may be that the pathogenicity of H5N1 viruses is masked by bad agricultural vaccines (Webster et al., 2006) . Vaccination and culling had both been modelled in recent years for the control of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) epidemics (e.g. Woolhouse et al., 1996; Woolhouse, 2003; Chowell et al., 2006; Hutber et al., 2006) . Culling has traditionally been used in the prevention of animal disease outbreaks, sometimes in combination with other measures and mixed success (Courtenay et al., 2002) . Many of the above-mentioned studies on impact of control measures for FMD include culling as a major component, which has been found to be especially effective and remains to be the method of choice for disease control of FMD. Interestingly, Hadeler & Freedman (1989) showed, under their modelling assumptions, culling the predator to lead to extinction of both predator and prey populations, perhaps indicating the complexity involved in modelling control measures in a predator-prey system.",

Moreover, this interaction between humans and birds might not be best represented as a predator-prey interaction with Holling type-II functional response, which would require substantial modification in our model that is beyond the scope of this study.",

Moreover, since E B is the unique asymptotically stable equilibrium of (3.1) and on the boundary of the first quadrant which is the feasible region for (3.1), E B must be globally asymptotically stable for (3.1). Part (ii) of the lemma follows trivially from Jacobian of E B .For (iii), we proceed to show that E B is globally asymptotically stable for (3.1) as follows. First, suppose that (\u03c6 1 (t), \u03c6 2 (t)) is a solution of the system (3.1) which starts at a pointThus, the solution cannot become infinite between x and the line L: S = K , and must cross L at a point y = (K , y 2 ) with x 2 < y 2 < \u221e. Now, let U be the region bounded by P 1 = y 2 , P 1 = 0, S = x 1 and S > 0 and the line segment x y. From the analysis of flow direction on the boundary of U , we can see that U is an invariant set with respect to the system (3.1). Since there is no positive interior equilibrium, the system has no any periodic solutions. Thus for any solution starting in U , its positive limit set is E B . Furthermore, since the region U is arbitrary, it follows from Brauer & Nohel (1969) (Lemma 5.4, p. 212 ) that E B is globally asymptotically stable for (3.1).Under the above assumptions, this implies that the system (3.1) has a unique limit cycle that is globally asymptotically orbitally stable.",
