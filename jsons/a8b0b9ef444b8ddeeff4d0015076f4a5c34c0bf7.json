Despite significant improvements in the survival rates of children younger than 5 years around the world, pneumonia remains a leading killer of children globally [1] . A majority of the 1 million pneumonia deaths per year in children <5 years old occur in low-and middle-income countries; most of them are clustered in Africa [1] . Laboratory diagnostics, such as bacterial cultures and respiratory viral testing, are often lacking in these resource-poor settings [2] , which contributes to the dearth of accurate epidemiological data and an unnecessary use of antibiotics, especially outside of tertiary care hospitals. A broad-scope assay that provides an unbiased description of a wide array of respiratory pathogens in children in developing countries is needed.",

Because of the similarities of these 2 viruses, our assay was unable to differentiate them from each other. Because almost half of the patients in whom RV was detected were asymptomatic in other studies [6] , the role of RV as a lower respiratory tract pathogen remains uncertain. However, current advances in molecular diagnostic techniques have revealed the presence of RV in the lower respiratory tract, and its role in lower airway diseases is increasingly being reported [5, 7] . As in other studies [8, 9] , RSV was detected in a significant proportion of children in our study. Children with RSV were found to be younger and to have more severe respiratory symptoms than children with a different viral infection, which is consistent with previous reports in the literature [9, 10] . Influenza was detected in fewer than 3% of the participants, and we found no apparent seasonal peak in this 2-year study. Because tropical climates usually lack identifiable fall, winter, spring, and summer seasons, the incidence of viral respiratory pathogens might not be similar to those in temperate climates. In Ghana, we found a clear increase in the incidence of RSV and MPV during the rainy months and a marked decrease in the dry season, which might be an effect of more crowding during the rainy season, because it is often seen during the winter months in other settings.",
