Atypical pneumonia (SARS) was first reported from Guangdong Province, China in late 2002. SARS caused a global pandemic in 2003 with approximately 10% (774/8098) case fatality rate (CFR) [2]. SARS-CoV has not circulated in humans since 2004. MERS-CoV was first reported from Saudi Arabia in 2012 and has continued to infect humans with limited human-to-human transmission, leading to a CFR of approximately 34.4% (858/2494) in 27 countries, according to the most recent WHO reporti. Both SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV are zoonotic viruses. They use bats as their natural reservoirs and transmit from bats to intermediate hosts (e.g., palm civets for SARS-CoV, dromedary camels for MERS-CoV), leading to infection in humans [2,3].",

            "text": "Similar to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 is an enveloped, single-stranded, and positive (+)-sense RNA virus, belonging to the beta-CoV genera in the family Coronaviridae [4]. The genome of this and other emerging pathogenic human CoVs encodes four major structural proteins [spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N)], approximately 16 nonstructural proteins (nsp1\u201316), and five to eight accessory proteins. Among them, the S protein plays an essential role in viral attachment, fusion, entry, and transmission. It comprises an N-terminal S1 subunit responsible for virus\u2013receptor binding and a C-terminal S2 subunit responsible for virus\u2013cell membrane fusion [2,3]. S1 is further divided into an N-terminal domain (NTD) and a receptor-binding domain (RBD). SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV bind angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) while MERS-CoV binds dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4), as receptors on the host cell expressing ACE2 (e.g., pneumocytes, enterocytes) or DPP4 (e.g., liver or lung cells including Huh-7, MRC-5, and Calu-3) [2,3,8]. Phylogenetically, SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to SARS-CoV, sharing approximately 79.6% genomic sequence identity [4]. During infection, CoV first binds the host cell through interaction between its S1-RBD and the cell membrane receptor, triggering conformational changes in the S2 subunit that result in virus fusion and entry into the target cell (see human CoV life cycle in Figure 1A) [2,3].",

For example, the human neutralizing mAbs S230.15 and m396 were isolated from SARS-CoV-infected individuals. They neutralize human and palm civet SARS-CoV infection by interacting with the RBD, thus blocking binding between the viral RBD and the cellular ACE2 receptor [9]. Other human mAbs, such as S109.8 and S227.14, have cross-neutralizing activity against multiple human, palm civet, and raccoon dog SARS-CoV infectious clones, protecting mice against four different homologous and heterologous SARS-CoV strains [10]. Human nAb 80R (scFv or mAb) neutralizes SARS-CoV infection by blocking the RBD\u2013ACE2 interaction, although its protective efficacy has not yet been reported [11]. A variety of SARS-CoV RBD-specific mouse neutralizing mAbs are sufficiently potent to block RBD\u2013ACE2 binding, thus neutralizing viral infection in ACE2-transfected HEK293T cells [12]. Despite their strong neutralizing activity and/or protection in cells or animal models, none of these SARS-CoV nAbs has ever been evaluated in clinical studies. Thus, to determine potential cross-neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 infection, such studies should be vigorously undertaken.",

            "text": "However, since SARS-CoV-2 is closely related to SARS-CoV and since their S proteins have high sequence identity [4], researchers have attempted to discover SARS-CoV nAbs with potential cross-reactivity and/or cross-neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 infection. Notably, a SARS-CoV RBD-specific human neutralizing mAb, CR3022, could bind SARS-CoV-2 RBD with high affinity and recognize an epitope on the RBD that does not overlap with the ACE2-binding site [13]. In addition, sera from convalescent SARS patients or from animals specific for SARS-CoV S1 may cross-neutralize SARS-CoV-2 infection by reducing S protein-mediated SARS-CoV-2 entry [14]. Moreover, SARS-CoV RBD-specific polyclonal antibodies have cross-reacted with the SARS-CoV-2 RBD protein and cross-neutralized SARS-CoV-2 infection in HEK293T cells stably expressing the human ACE2 receptor, opening avenues for the potential development of SARS-CoV RBD-based vaccines that might eventually prevent SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV infection [15]. It is also possible that SARS-CoV RBD-targeting nAbs might be applied for prophylaxis and treatment of SARS-CoV-2 infection in the current absence of SARS-CoV-2-specific vaccines and antibodies. However, robust testing lies ahead.",

            "text": "SARS-CoV-2 continues to infect people globally with the concomitant urgency to develop effective nAbs as prophylactic and therapeutic agents to prevent and treat its infection and control its spread. Studies from SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have demonstrated that many fragments (S1-NTD, RBD, S2) in S proteins can be used as targets to develop nAbs. Still, RBD-specific antibodies have greater potency to neutralize infection with divergent virus strains, suggesting that the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 can also serve as an important target for the development of potent and specific nAbs. Cocktails comprising antibodies specific for RBD and other regions in the S protein may further improve the breadth and potency of nAbs against SARS-CoV-2 and its escape-mutant strains. Human sera from convalescent patients have been used to treat COVID-19, but lessons learned from SARS show that some non-nAbs targeting the non-RBD regions in the S protein may cause an antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) effect on viral infectivity and disease, as well as other harmful immune responses [2]. On a positive note, some anti-SARS-CoV nAbs have shown cross-reactivity or cross-neutralizing activity against SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro. Thus, overall, research on SARS-CoV- and MERS-CoV-specific nAbs should provide important guidelines for the rapid design and development of SARS-CoV-2-specific nAbs.",

(A) Life cycle of highly pathogenic human CoVs. These CoVs enter host cells by first binding to their respective cellular receptors [angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV-2 or SARS-CoV and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) for Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV] on the membranes of host cells expressing ACE2 (e.g., pneumocytes, enterocytes) or DPP4 (e.g., liver or lung cells including Huh-7, MRC-5, and Calu-3) via the surface spike (S) protein, which mediates virus\u2013cell membrane fusion and viral entry. Viral genomic RNA is released and translated into viral polymerase proteins. The negative (\u2212)-sense genomic RNA is synthesized and used as a template to form subgenomic or genomic positive (+)-sense RNA. Viral RNA and nucleocapsid (N) structural protein are replicated, transcribed, or synthesized in the cytoplasm, whereas other viral structural proteins, including S, membrane (M), and envelope (E), are transcribed then translated in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and transported to the Golgi. The viral RNA\u2013N complex and S, M, and E proteins are further assembled in the ER\u2013Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) to form a mature virion, then released from host cells. (B) Potential targets of nAbs against SARS-CoV-2 and other pathogenic human CoVs. (a) Human CoV receptor binding and membrane fusion process. The CoV first binds a viral receptor (ACE2 or DPP4) through the receptor-binding domain (RBD) in the S protein, followed by fusion of the virus with cell membranes via the formation of a six-helix bundle (6-HB) fusion core. NTD, N-terminal domain. (b) Potential targets of nAbs on the S protein of human CoVs. Monoclonal antibody (mAb), antigen-binding fragment (Fab), single-chain variable region fragment (scFv), or single-domain antibody [nanobody (Nb) or VHH derived from camelid heavy chain antibody (HcAb)] binds to the RBD, S1 subunit (non-RBD, including NTD), or S2 of the viral S protein, blocking binding between the RBD and the respective receptor (for RBD-targeting nAbs), interfering with the conformational change of S (for S1-targeting nAbs), or hindering S2-mediated membrane fusion (for S2-targeting nAbs), leading to the inhibition of infection with pathogenic human CoVs in the host cells.
