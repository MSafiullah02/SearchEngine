However, the investment of resources in primary care institutions is not based on the actual medical demands of the public. This study analysed primary care utilization to provide targeted guidance for the improvement of primary healthcare delivery in China. Methods: We extracted outpatient visit data from all community healthcare centres in Shanghai from 2014 to 2018. Diseases were then classified according to ICD-10 codes. The disease spectrum (frequency, proportion, rank) was stratified by sex, age, and region. Results: Most primary care outpatients were female (58.20%), 60-79 years old (57.91%), and in suburban regions (62.18%). Chronic diseases accounted for the majority (91.41%). Hypertension, chronic ischaemic heart disease, diabetes, and acute upper respiratory tract infections were the top four disorders for primary care visits regardless of sex. In the group aged 0-18 years, symptoms, signs and abnormal clinical and laboratory findings not elsewhere classified accounted for 37.96% of the top 20 reasons. Acute upper respiratory tract infections were the most common diseases in the groups aged 0-18 (11.20%) and 19-39 (11.14%) years. However, hypertension was the most common disease in the group aged > 39 years old (> 20%). There were more outpatients with respiratory and digestive diseases in suburban areas than in urban areas. In addition, problems associated with medical equipment and other healthcare deficiencies were relatively more common in suburban areas (suburban: 4.13%, rank 5; urban: 2.29%, rank 10).",

The public tends to go directly to secondary and tertiary public hospitals instead of primary care institutions because of the high quality care in hospitals. To promote the medical capabilities of community healthcare institutions, China is actively learning from Western countries, enacting healthcare reform and vigorously developing general practices in communities. In the community healthcare institutions in China, usually the general practitioners provided health service for the patients, and the patients should pay for the service each time when they seek the treatment. For patients with various health insurance, namely urban social insurance for workers, urban social insurance for citizens, new rural cooperative medical insurance, self-paying or other, the reimbursement ratio showed a decreasing tendency in that order. However, the current health insurance hasn't played important role in restricting patients' behaviour [1, 2] . The ageing of society and the accompanying high incidence rates of chronic diseases [3] have led primary healthcare institutions to prioritize the prevention and treatment of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs). This finding is consistent with the results of the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013 [4] , which showed that the disease burden was dominated by NCDs, affecting years lived with disabilities (YLDs) in all regions except sub-Saharan Africa. In the past 20 years, NCDs have been the focus of researchers and policy makers worldwide.",

However, there is no accurate evidence supporting this prioritization of conditions and the consequent allocation of medical resources in community healthcare institutions. The limitations of the existing studies are as follows: first, there is a lack of high-quality institution-level disease spectrum evidence [3, 5] . Usually, the conclusions drawn were primarily based on data from the CDC surveillance system in China [1] [2] [3] . However, these data are sampled and are usually targeted at the cause of death and the morbidity rates of specific diseases, including some infectious diseases and a small proportion of chronic diseases, such as cancer. Second, although existing research has studied disease patterns, few have explored the characteristics of those patients who primarily seek service in community institutions [5] [6] [7] [8] . To increase the accuracy of the morbidity rates of broader categories of infectious diseases and NCDs, increasing numbers of studies are beginning to focus on the high-level data, such as inpatient and outpatient electronic health records (EHRs), which are collected from healthcare institutions. Yu et al. elucidated the spectrum and characteristics of severe NCDs in eastern coastal China by analysing the longitudinal EHRs from inpatients in 12 general tertiary hospitals [5] . In 2017, the Health Bureau of Chongqing city in China analysed the characteristics of inpatients with cancer based on EHRs from all secondary and tertiary hospitals [9] . However, there is a lack of service demand and healthcare delivery in primary care institutions.",

However, unlike in the younger age groups, in those older than 40 years, cardiovascular and circulatory diseases and endocrine and nutritional metabolic diseases were the most common. For instance, cardiovascular and circulatory diseases were the most common disease system for visits and accounted for 33.33, 40.61, 43.86% of the visits in the groups aged 40-59 years, 60-79 years, and older than 80 years, respectively. Visits for chronic respiratory diseases (ranked 1 to 2, accounting for 33.09 to 10.48% of all outpatient visits as age increased) and digestive diseases (ranked 3 to 5, accounting for 12.96 to 7.51% of all outpatient visits as age increased) were both common in all age groups. Furthermore, compared to the proportion in the group of outpatients aged 0- 18 years, the proportions of musculoskeletal diseases were relatively higher in the other age groups, ranking fourth to fifth. Among outpatients of all ages, the proportion of those with neoplasms in the community was relatively low. Comparatively speaking, the proportion of outpatient visits for injuries and poisoning and the proportion for communicable disorders were higher in the group of outpatients aged 0-18 years. Figure 3 shows that in the group of outpatients aged 0-18 years, symptoms that affected health without diseases or injuries accounted for 37.96% of the top 20 disorders for outpatient visits. Among NCDs, acute upper respiratory tract infections were most common among the groups of outpatients aged 0-18 (n = 315,876, 11.20%) and 19-39 years (n = 980,678, 11.14%). However, as age increased, the number of outpatients with this condition decreased. Normal pregnancy supervision (n = 271,510, 3.08%, rank 7), inflammation of the vagina and vulva (n = 151,058, 1.72%, rank 12), and menstrual disorders (n = 118,727, 1.35%, rank 20) were more common in the group aged 19-39 years than in the other groups. Among the patients aged > 39 years, hypertension was the most common disease (accounting for 20%). Meanwhile, diabetes and chronic ischaemic heart disease were also more relatively common in that age group. In addition, gastritis and duodenitis were relatively more common in the age groups older than 18 years (ranked 6 to 9).",

            "text": "Overall, visits for NCDs accounted for the majority of visits in our study. The fact that the proportions of visits for cardiovascular and circulatory diseases and chronic respiratory diseases were the highest may be associated with air pollution in Shanghai, as it has been proposed by many researchers that exposure to high levels of ambient particulate matter (PM) is related to the incidence of these diseases in China [11, 12] . Among cardiovascular diseases, hypertension and chronic ischaemic heart disease were the most common reasons outpatients sought care in community healthcare centres, especially among outpatients older than 18 years. This is consistent with the morbidity rates of chronic diseases in the \"Monitoring report of chronic diseases and their risk factors in Shanghai\" released by the Shanghai CDC, which reported that 28.4% of residents over 18 years old in Shanghai had hypertension in 2012 [13, 14] . These diseases should be paid particular attention when improving the medical capacity of community healthcare centres. Chronic respiratory diseases were common in both males and females and in various age groups (ranked 2). In the group aged < 39 years, the situation was more serious. In other cities in China, chronic respiratory diseases are severe and common due to air pollution [15] [16] [17] , and they have constituted a serious problem for many years [18, 19] . Data from a systematic review study with source from 17 provinces showed that for the outpatients between 0 and 18 years in community healthcare institutions, the number of respiratory diseases outpatients were the top one [20] . However, it ranked 2 for this age group in our study. This difference can be explained that many of the community health centres in Shanghai didn't have pediatric departments, and patients would love to choose the higher level hospitals due to its good access to these medical service. By comparing with other counties, we found that in the GBD study in 327 regions, the global incidence and prevalence rates of respiratory diseases, including chronic respiratory diseases and acute upper respiratory infections, were not the highest among all studied conditions. Additionally, in high-income developed countries, the estimated loss of YLDs due to respiratory diseases was much lower than that in low-income developed countries, regardless of sex or age [21] . This may be due to air pollution, which is positively associated with the admission of respiratory patients in developing countries among different age groups; this association is especially strong in vulnerable groups (children and elderly individuals) [22] [23] [24] . However, the fact that community health centre visits were frequently for acute upper respiratory tract infections was ignored in terms of public healthcare resource allocation [25] . In contrast, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and community-acquired pneumonia, which were rarely the reasons for visits to community healthcare centres, were afforded substantial attention from the government. This indicates that more resources should be allocated to the treatment of acute respiratory infections, especially in the relatively younger population. In this study, diabetes was more common in the group aged over 40 years than in the younger age groups. This was in accordance with the healthcare resource allocation policy. The group aged 0-30 years was more likely to suffer from digestive diseases than other age groups. The high proportion of outpatient visits for digestive diseases may be due in large part to the irregular eating habits that form part of the fast-paced lifestyle in Shanghai [26, 27] . However, digestive diseases have not received much attention in public health policies.",

Major success in preventing and treating these diseases in Shanghai may be primarily attributed to the efforts to prevent and control HIV, childhood infectious diseases, pneumonia, etc. The treatment and prevention of these diseases were the major objectives of the \"Public Health Action of the Shanghai Government\" (launched by the government to prevent major public health problems following the SARS outbreak in 2003 and focused on the control of both communicable diseases and NCDs) [29] .

The relatively low proportions of outpatients with these conditions may not be due to the actual incidence of these diseases but rather to the poor service in the community healthcare centres. For instance, the number of outpatients with neoplasms in this study was small, possibly because patients with these diseases directly visit higher-level hospitals. Interestingly, in our study, we found that symptoms affecting health but without diseases or injuries was a relatively common disease, especially in the groups aged 0-18 years (rank 1) and 19-39 years (rank 2). This indicated that general practitioners cannot diagnose many patients who seek medical services. Meanwhile, problems associated with medical equipment and other healthcare deficiencies were more common in suburban areas. Together, these findings suggest that disease diagnosis and treatment should be improved in the younger and suburban populations.",

However, because the referral system is not strict under the loosely regulated insurance system, more patients are inclined to initially visit higher-level hospitals. Community health care institutions are usually defined as playing a main role in disease prevention and control [32, 33] . Much work still needs to be done regarding the improvement of the medical functionality of community health care centres and the prevention and treatment of endemic diseases, which represents a gap between China and high-income countries [34, 35] . Based on the disease spectrum among outpatients in all community healthcare centres in Shanghai, we suggest that the delivery of primary care should be evidence-based and targeted at the services most commonly utilized by vulnerable groups.",

Second, due to the statistical power, there may be disease spectrum disparities between this study and other domestic and international studies. Further published results from the outpatient data are expected.
