            "text": "When Chai started working at the News Probe department at CCTV in 2001, she was a twenty-four-year-old \u201cliterary and artistic youth\u201d (wenyi qingnian \u6587\u85dd\u9752\u5e74) whose inspiration predominantly came from \u201cromance fiction and popular songs,\u201d as she would reflect more than a decade later. \u201cLiterary and artistic youth\u201d in the Chinese context refers to people in their twenties to forties who love literature, travel, photography, and arts and who speak sentimentally and tend to lose touch with reality.1 Chai admitted self-mockingly that these qualities made her sail through her earlier job at a Hunan radio station, where she read listeners\u2019 letters on the air for an evening program called \u201cGentle Night\u201d (Yese wenrou \u591c\u8272\u6eab\u67d4). Throughout Chai\u2019s career, she has never hesitated to self-criticize this unpractical aspect of her identity, underlining how it clashes with her journalistic mission of exposing some of the most hidden and complex realities in China. However, noticeably Chai has never lost her sentimentality, neither have her audiences and readers failed to recognize it. When Chai\u2019s Insight came out in 2013, some of her disapproving readers denominated her Chai Huiyin \u67f4\u5fbd\u56e0, alluding to Lin Huiyin \u6797\u5fbd\u56e0 (1904\u20131955), one of China\u2019s celebrity intellectuals known for her literary talent and romantic relations with several high-achieving men. The denomination poignantly recognizes Chai\u2019s literary talent while also reprehends her self-promotion in the book\u2019s much publicized press release.",

            "text": "Some other audiences and readers have also faulted Chai for her connections with powerful men. \u201cWhy are your friends all old men?\u201d asked one of Chai \u201cfriendlier\u201d audiences in the book release conference. Hinting unfairly that Chai\u2019s success had to do with gender-based favoritism rather than her capability, such questionings nevertheless drive home the fact that China\u2019s news corresponding had been male-dominated when Chai started her career at CCTV. Chen Meng \u9673\u867b (1961\u20132008), Chai\u2019s recruiter to CCTV, was a widely respected reformer in China\u2019s news apparatus, radically envisioning and implementing many groundbreaking changes in the CCTV news since the early 1990s. Similarly, Chai\u2019s partner Bai Yansong \u767d\u5ca9\u677e (b. 1968) was then a newly established media personality appreciated for his candid, sharp, and thoughtful approach to news reporting. Bai created, produced, and anchored \u201cHorizon Connection,\u201d through which Chai had her CCTV debut. Chai described in the first chapter of Insight the many mistakes she made at this onset of her CCTV career, highlighting, not without literary dramatization, how her colleagues\u2019 challenges and mentoring made possible her professional growth. Significantly, all of these nineteen colleague-mentors were men. Although Chai also mentioned two additional women colleagues in passing, they did not contribute to her professional development. A woman called Sister Lei \u96f7\u59d0 attempted to be a matchmaker, arranging Chai with another colleague. Chai also heard that some CCTV executive remarked that she looked like Jing Yidan \u656c\u4e00\u4e39 (b. 1955), an award-winning hostess of economy-related programs. Chai\u2019s colleagues interpreted this remark as the executive\u2019s approval of Chai\u2019s hire. The deep irony here is that to some of her seniors and her colleagues alike Chai\u2019s look seemed to matter more than her quality.",

            "text": "Chai\u2019s lack of female role models was further complicated by the unprecedented changes in the CCTV news itself. Since the early 1990s, a new documentary movement had begun shaping in China. Filmmakers and television professionals took advantage of the spread of video technology and hoped to \u201copen up new public spaces for discussion of social problems and dilemmas in the post-socialist era\u201d (Berry et al. 10). Consciously distancing themselves from the official propagandistic news and culture production mode, filmmakers and media professionals both inside and outside the state-owned film studios and television stations started experimenting with \u201ca more spontaneous mode of documentary\u201d (Berry et al. 5) that focused on the experiences of people marginalized by China\u2019s modernization. They used hand-held cameras to record unrehearsed and unscripted pieces of realities\u2014\u201cMy camera doesn\u2019t lie\u201d was one of their slogans2\u2014and later went as far as completely democratizing video making itself and letting the voiceless record themselves.3 In news reporting, Oriental Horizon (Dongfang shikong \u6771\u65b9\u6642\u7a7a, est. 1993) combined investigative journalism and news-documentary realism and quickly became a hit. Chai\u2019s seniors Chen and Bai were both deeply involved in the formation of Oriental Horizon. Bai anchored the news magazine and became its spokesperson. Chen famously verbalized the catchphrase\u2014\u201cTelling the common folks\u2019 own stories\u201d (jiangshu laobaixing ziji de gushi \u8b1b\u8ff0\u8001\u767e\u59d3\u81ea\u5df1\u7684\u6545\u4e8b)\u2014for Life Space (shenghuo kongjian \u751f\u6d3b\u7a7a\u9593), the hallmark segment of Oriental Horizon. The path-breaking nature of the news programs that Chai joined meant that she had no models to follow and must come to an understanding of what news meant to her and her audiences through both soul searching and hand-on experiences.",

            "text": "All these uncertainties made Chai feel unprepared and vulnerable. Apparently, she felt like an impersonator, a syndrome many professional women share in an unsupportive working environment. As she wrote in Insight, she kept dreaming about days of her cheating in a vision test in fourth grade by memorizing the last line on the test poster. She also tried to hide herself in the crowd when the station anchors gathered for a group photo. When simultaneously interviewing three guests on the phone from the newsroom\u2014with images of the guests to be edited in later due to technological restrictions\u2014Chai felt disconnected and instead became highly conscious of her own gestures. She was too anxious to breathe and had to deep breathe in the restroom. She also found herself resorting to clich\u00e9d phrases such as \u201cLet\u2019s hope for the prompt arrival of a democratic and law-governing society\u201d to safely conclude some of her news corresponding so that she could run away from it. Naturally she found strength through withdrawing to literature, where she felt most at home. Clarice Starling, the twenty-four-year-old F.B.I. trainee in Thomas Harris\u2019s novel The Silence of the Lambs, became her alter ego. In the novel, Starling starts with the need to prove herself in the male-dominated bureau but eventually transforms into a confident agent resolved to serve nobody but the silent women victims of cannibalism. It was the single thought that \u201cNothing can make Starling afraid\u201d which kept Chai sitting at her newsroom in spite of the perceived failures at the beginning of her CCTV career, as she confessed with hindsight in Insight.",

            "text": "When Chai was interviewed for her CCTV position, she was asked, \u201cWhat concerns you the most when you do news?\u201d She answered, \u201cThe human in the news.\u201d It was this constant concern for the human when suddenly confronting disastrously inhuman situations in 2003, which helped Chai breakthrough from her earlier frustration and develop her own news reporting and commentating style. Within the two months from February to April 2003, Chai found herself doing on-the-spot reporting from two of China\u2019s most distinctive locations, the remote Uygur area devastated by a 6.8 magnitude earthquake that caused more than two hundred deaths, and the political and cultural capital Beijing plagued by an outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic, with more than nine hundred confirmed cases and more than two thousand probable cases by mid and late April. Chai would later call these experiences a turning point of her career. \u201cAll started with uncertainty. You don\u2019t have time to deliberate on what questions you want to ask. Only from uncertainty can one forget all about oneself. It was in this situation that I found what I really wanted\u201d (Li). As disasters are unpredictable and destructive, disaster reporting involves a larger extent of on-the-spot improvisation and spontaneity. This gave Chai much-needed agency to explore her media persona. In what follows, I analyze Chai\u2019s SARS coverage from four angles, focusing on how her disaster reporting credited her as a journalist.",

Disasters are unnegotiable and the stakes are high, with humans stuck in liminality and caught in intensive emotion. This sets up a great background for great storytelling, the core of great news reporting. As a CCTV reporter, Chai had privileged access to this stage. She was on her way to Uygur half an hour after the earthquake and was able to get to its center by taking a military transporter (Chai 16). Her prompt first-hand experience filled in the need for the latest information to keep her audiences updated and to facilitate coordinated disaster-relief. Because the transmission of this information itself can mean the difference between life and death for victims, as media visibility may expedite relief action, this type of reports generally tends to be treated as more valuable. Moreover, in an age when social media did not yet exist, television news were the predominant means by which people were informed about the disasters. All these factors made it possible for Chai\u2019s coverage to get the immediate attention of the largest possible number of audiences.",

Precisely because disasters have great potential of causing social instability, the Chinese government tended to execute strict control of disaster news release and sometimes opted for a cover-up. Just months before the SARS outbreak, Western media warned how China\u2019s \u201ccatastrophic mismanagement of its AIDS crisis\u201d (Kristof), which was largely caused by illegal blood collecting in Henan Province, will result in unprecedented deaths if the official cover-up continued. The SARS outbreak seemed to have been treated in a similar fashion in the beginning, with the Chinese media instructed to propagandize that the situation was under control and there was no need to be \u201cpanic\u201d (konghuang \u6050\u614c). But an unexpected turn-around took place on 20 April 2003, when China\u2019s health minister Zhang Wenkang \u5f35\u6587\u5eb7 (b. 1940) and Beijing mayor Meng Xuenong \u5b5f\u5b78\u8fb2 (b. 1949) were fired for \u201cmishandling the matter.\u201d The firing may have been necessitated by the governmental need to fully publicize the seriousness of the epidemic in order to discourage mass travels anticipated for each May. It created the impression that government officials were held accountable and the people\u2019s \u201cright of knowing\u201d was reinstated. Chai\u2019s reporting on SARS, which began three days before the firing and aired several days thereafter, coincidentally provided a timely outlet for people to exercise this newly vindicated \u201cright of knowing.\u201d More than 70 million people watched the 35-minute special report in which Chai, covered by white insulating clothing and gauze masks, entered the quarantined sections of Beijing hospitals where SARS patients were treated and, for the first time since the outbreak, interviewed.",

            "text": "Chai became the face of SARS reporting not only because of her strong work ethics\u2014\u201cIf I were to have a child in the future and he asked me, \u2018Mom, what were you doing when SARS broke out?\u2019 I cannot just say, \u2018I was watching TV.\u2019 I really cannot just say that!\u201d Chai reflected later (Chai 21)\u2014but also because that the ways that she conducted the interviews pioneered a profound transformation of Chinese reporters from a detached information transmitter into an empathetic individual capable of co-experiencing what the interviewees were experiencing. Amid the life-threatening public health crisis, everyone was equally vulnerable; some of the first causalities of the epidemic were health professionals. Chai\u2019s awareness of her own vulnerability and her refusal to succumb to it made her not only a credible reporter but also a relatable and likable individual. The high risk that she took highlighted the worthiness of the \u201cright of knowing,\u201d and the idea of a slender and young woman confronting deadly viruses for the sake of public understanding was immediately heart-warming and guilt-provoking. In fact, in the first interview when Chai\u2019s team had to let her enter the quarantined area alone with a hidden audio recorder\u2014the cameramen were banned because there was no way to insulate and sanitize their heavy equipment\u2014the left-behind camera lingered on her back and the glass door that she entered through for an extended time. This camera\u2019s gaze is meta-narratorial in its recognition of its own limits and its concern for Chai. That Chai did not stop at where the camera had to stop helped construct her as a credible reporter seeking nothing but truth, truth that she deemed more important than her life. In this process, Chai has also transformed from the insecure girl disconnected with the news that she was commentating into a dedicated reporter fully immersed in the news in its making. At the same time, her own sense of insecurity has also been subliminally transcended. The epidemic reveals that being vulnerable is an integral and universal part of human experience and embracing it rather than denying it is the only way to survive or to thrive.",

            "text": "Through the SARS reporting, Chai developed her own distinctive style of news probing. In the succeeding hospital visits, she treated her interviewees as fellow human beings and encouraged them to share their feelings. When talking to a patient, she said, \u201cUnderstandably there are currently a lot of fear about the disease. Can you tell us from the perspective of a patient what it feels like to have this disease?\u201d By discussing fear with the patient, the target of the fear, Chai was including rather than excluding the patient in the construction of SARS discourses and also insisting that the humanity of the patient rather than the virality of the patient should be emphasized. The patient\u2019s subsequent description, which highlighted that this disease was not so different from other more common diseases in its identifiable pattern of development, serves to demystify the virus. In fact, this patient was so comfortable with sharing her feelings with Chai that she expressed that she felt for the nurses and doctors who took care of her. She said, \u201cThey wore thirty layers of gauzed masks but they still got infected. They take care of us but then they cannot go home. This is really hard on them!\u201d That a patient infected with a deadly virus can feel empathy for her caregivers only shows how humans are deeply connected when facing their vulnerability. Throughout the report, Chai effortlessly created contexts for her interviewees to talk about their feelings. \u201cCan you go home after work?\u201d she asked a nurse this seemingly obvious question. As the interview went on, the audience learned what going home actually meant for the nurse: she and her fianc\u00e9 had to postpone their wedding ceremony and had not seen each other for more than a month. This episode reminded people how life had been interrupted by the epidemic but it also emphasized how the epidemic had made people care even more for others. In another occasion, Chai asked a doctor, \u201cYou knew the risk of working here, but why did you volunteer to stay?\u201d Visibly getting emotional in spite of the cover of insulating clothes and masks, the doctor recognized her own vulnerability but insisted that the virus only makes humans more connected. \u201cI could be one of them,\u201d she said plainly. This message about shared burden is all the more powerful because it comes from a quarantined hospital room, a space designated to separate people. At the end of the report, Chai asked a patient who almost died of the infection but was on her way to recovery, \u201cHave you ever thought what you want to do the most when you are discharged?\u201d The patient seemed shocked to face this question and stuttered, \u201cAi-ya\u2026I\u2019ve thought too much [about this]\u2026Life is really, really\u2026I have a new understanding of life now.\u201d Chai\u2019s ability to arouse feelings made her SARS report a heart-warming piece about humanity, community, and connectivity. She also exemplified how a reporter\u2019s personality can memorably shape the ways that stories unfold.",

            "text": "Chai left the CCTV in 2014 and returned to the public sphere in 2015 with her documentary Under the Dome, which uses a TED talk format to combine personal testimonials, graphs and data, animation, and interviews to investigate the causes of China\u2019s air pollution. Because the film was taken down from online shortly after its release, many assumed an antagonistic relation between Chai and the official censorship. But such an assumption is reductive and unhelpful in explaining Chai\u2019s dynamic engagement with authorities. Just as Chai had used the CCTV as a platform for her investigative journalism, she had also used the network and resources developed from her CCTV career to gather insiders\u2019 information and win interview opportunities for this film. Many also assumed that Chai had left CCTV to develop an independent voice\u2014Chai\u2019s fans often asked how she could have, for so long, \u201cheld fast to\u201d (jianshou \u5805\u5b88) her ideals while in CCTV\u2014but I would like to argue that it was the ongoing changes in CCTV that made possible and sustained Chai\u2019s rise. Chai\u2019s book Insight clearly shows how her career is about negotiating with media conventions and creatively testing the boundaries of governmental control. \u201cMany things exist only because there were people who believed in them,\u201d Chai wrote in 2013, showing how she perceived her work to be a force to push for the realization of ideals through navigating through the system, rather than a force to attack and invalidate the system itself (Chai 155\u2013173). The production and circulation of Under the Dome demonstrates that Chai has been consistent with her active negotiation with powers rather than suddenly shifting her self-positioning to subvert those powers.",

Earlier on, she had covered environmental topics such as sandstorms, polluted rivers, and problems caused by trash burning and coking plants, during her CCTV career. The beginning of Under the Dome particularly referenced her earlier coverage of how the coal mining and coking plants in her hometown Shanxi Province \u5c71\u897f had become a public health hazard. One of the most memorable moments of this segment was when a six-year-old local girl confessed that she had seen neither a blue sky nor a piece of white cloud in her whole life. Inspired by Al Gore\u2019s Inconvenient Truth, Chai aimed to unpack the information that she discovered and made them accessible and memorable.7 Throughout the documentary, she kept reassuring her audiences that she, just as everyone else, was also ignorant of the concepts, data, graphs, and discourses on the smog. The film is simultaneously a piece of scientific popularization (kepu \u79d1\u666e) and public relation (gongguan \u516c\u95dc), intending to dispel myth about the smog and call for some collective pressure upon the government for reform. Specifically, the timing of the documentary\u2019s online release (28 February 2015) corresponded with the annual \u201cTwo Conferences\u201d (3 and 5 March 2015), which Chai had earlier reported, in a particularly important year when discussions at the conferences were anticipated to shape China\u2019s key policymaking in the many years to come.

She then engaged her audiences visually, another powerful tool of TED talks (Gallo), showing a picture of her toddler confined at home peeking at the heavy smog outside the window (Image 3.2). \u201cI panic when my daughter smiles to me [because of the smog she is breathing in],\u201d Chai stated, turning a mother\u2013daughter bonding moment into a nightmarish battle that she has no way to win. Chai embraced her vulnerability in the most resolutely desperate form here: she was a helpless mother that did not know who her enemy was and how she could fight back. Notably Chai is drawing on a biological discourse (her being a mother) to justify her exploration of the environmental discourse, making it possible to interpret the documentary through the lens of ecofeminism.8 For instance, earlier ecofeminists defended animal rights as a biological calling, indicating that women have more compassion for animals (Ropers-Huilman ix).\n",

Considering reason and nature as being separated and incompatible, some audiences stated that Chai lacked scientific proof to link her baby\u2019s tumor to the smog. One of China\u2019s most rebellious artists, Ai Weiwei \u827e\u672a\u672a (b. 1957), went as far as calling Chai a \u201cbrain-damaged mother\u201d and further insulted that \u201cthose who comprehend the notion of smog only through Chai\u2019s womb must be brain-damaged, too\u201d (Cui 32).

Chai reveals how China\u2019s excessive coal consumptions, ineffectively regulated automobile emission, inferior oil quality, flawed policymaking dominated by petroleum companies, and powerless environmental agency have collectively contributed to the smog hazard. She not only explored what caused the problems but also explained how they caused the problems, situating the environmental problems into larger historical contexts. For instance, she revealed how China\u2019s energy industries have inherited policymaking privileges from the state-regulated economy era and conveniently translated this political status quo into economic gains in the market-driven economy. She also revealed many gray areas in automobile and industrial emission controls, showing how state and local environmental agencies have been marginalized by recent state-level policies that heavily prioritize economic development. Chai also referenced the lessons of London and Los Angeles in their tough recovery from air pollution, driving home her points about the worrying long-term damages caused by short-term economic gains. Chai\u2019s interviewees are all insiders of the government, the law reinforcements, the industries, and the academia. Each of them is not only dissatisfied with the situation but also remarkably critical of the existing systems. Chai provided a platform for them to candidly express themselves and to contradict each other\u2019s claims, shedding light on how unclearly defined governmental functions, intertwined with prevalent self-interests and lack in transparency, have collectively led to non-action and dangerous numbness to the urgency of this problem. Chai did not claim originality for these information, but she firmly pushed the publicity of these information in a systematic manner so that reform could become possible.",

            "text": "The banning of Under the Dome should be situated in the context of how the Chinese government has become increasingly responsive to public discourses. When facing environmental issues, the state actually also has a high stake. Environmental issues pose a challenge to the sustainability of China\u2019s economic model and can potentially mobilize people and escalate into a threat to the \u201charmonious society\u201d (hexie shehui \u548c\u8ae7\u793e\u6703) that the Chinese government hopes to build. The government therefore must take them seriously. In this context, Chai\u2019s film could be useful for the state to vent out people\u2019s frustration and to test the possibility of reform. With frequent, unprecedented changes happening in all aspects of Chinese society within a short period of time, it is not uncommon for practices to precede regulation in post-socialist China, as new changes demand new regulations. The rise and fall of Chai\u2019s documentary apparently follows a familiar pattern: as something independently produced, the documnentary rose from the margin of China\u2019s media apparatus, suddenly became viral and mainstream (the documentary received 117 million views within 24 hours), and eventually faced state\u2019s regulation because of its popularity. In this case, the state stepped in to shut down the online circulation of Under the Dome in order to contain potential damages, for the film could make people interpret the smog as a \u201chuman-caused catastrophe\u201d and finger point at the state, whose legitimacy has largely depended on aggressive economic development that devastated the environment. But pulling the documentary offline does not mean that Chai\u2019s work does not have any meaningful impact upon the government. Notably the Chinese government finally began incorporating environmental factors into the evaluation of state and local officials\u2019 work in 2016.",

            "text": "The various attacks of Under the Dome provide a useful lens into how the construction of environmental discourses in China is radically contested and unavoidably linked to political and economic discourses. Firstly, some audiences criticized Chai for prioritizing environmental issues over economic development. They further claimed that this tension reflected the conflicted interests between the \u201cwell-off middle-class elites,\u201d to whom Chai belongs, and the poor who presumably could benefit from aggressive economic development. When there are many people struggling with basic food and housing issues, they declared, it is insensitive and pretentious for Chai to discuss clean air as a human right. This criticism of Chai is driven by an anxiety about modernization, which the state has effectively used to justify its economic ambition, and will be a continuous burden of China\u2019s environmental movement. Secondly, some specifically attacked Chai\u2019s elitist status, showing how the Chinese society has been stratified and how the tensions among different social classes have intensified as a result of China\u2019s uneven development. That Chai\u2019s daughter was born in America seemed to fuel this criticism, triggering heated debate about whether she was hypocritical to give birth to an American citizen while also claiming she deeply cared about China. Some, justifiably concerned about the urban and rural gap, also argued that Chai\u2019s campaign against smog may divert limited sources from more serious environmental issues, such as polluted lands and water in the countryside, that have plagued powerless farmers. Thirdly, Chai\u2019s film has also suffered nationalistic interpretations fueled by conspiracy theory. Critics stated that Chai\u2019s self-declared \u201cpersonal war against the smog\u201d was actually a Western smear of China\u2019s economic miracle. Presumably the film received funding from Western powers\u2014while in reality Chai used the royalty of her book to self-produce the film\u2014in order to sabotage China\u2019s economic development through portraying the smog as a negative result of that development. Under the Dome triggered an intensive, renewed interest in Chai\u2019s 2005 interview of Ding Zhongli \u4e01\u4ef2\u79ae (b. 1957), a geologist and fellow of the Chinese Academy of Science. Clearly, the interview demonstrates how Chai\u2019s neoliberal perspective\u2014she emphasized universal standards, co-existence, and shared environmental burden across the world\u2014clashes with Ding\u2019s China-centered perspective. Ding articulated with powerful elocution that the right for emission (paifangquan \u6392\u653e\u6b0a) equals the right for economic development (fazhanquan \u767c\u5c55\u6b0a) and that each Chinese people should be allowed to have a fairly calculated amount of emission when compared to their Western counterpart. Ding\u2019s openly admitted patriotism gave the impression that Chai lacked it in her emphasis on the shared burden of the international community and her insistence that environmental issues transcend international politics, making Under the Dome even more politically suspicious for some of its Chinese audiences.",

            "text": "\nThe abbreviation is \u201cwenqing\u201d \u6587\u9752. Some also translated the term as \u201cthe cultured youth.\u201d The use of the term has a clearly negative undertone. When one uses this to refer to oneself it often intends to humorously self-disparage. A stereotypical female wenqing usually wears cotton clothes and shoes, reads literary works by Eileen Chang \u5f35\u611b\u73b2 (1920\u20131995) and Haruki Murakami (b. 1949), watches arthouse movies, listens to non-mainstream music, carries professional cameras, drinks coffee, and loves to travel. She also embraces romantic fantasies and indulges in sentimental self-reflection. A stereotypical male wenqing tends to be quiet and mature, capable of commanding language and echoing others\u2019 feelings, and leans toward spirituality and perfectionism.The line was originally from Lou Ye\u2019s \u5a41\u71c1 (b. 1965) film Suzhou River \u8607\u5dde\u6cb3 (2000) and became associated with China\u2019s underground filmmaking through Solveig Klassen and Katharina Schneider-Roos\u2019s 2003 documentary with the same title. The underground filmmakers interviewed in this documentary, including Zhang Yuan \u5f35\u5143 (b. 1963), Wang Xiaoshuai \u738b\u5c0f\u5e25 (b. 1966), Jia Zhangke \u8d3e\u6a1f\u67ef (b. 1970), Li Yu \u674e\u7389 (b. 1973), were later called \u201cthe urban generation\u201d or \u201cthe Sixth Generation\u201d and their works characteristically adopt the documentary style.A prominent example is Wu Wenguang \u5433\u6587\u5149 (b. 1956), whose independent documentary Bumming in Beijing: The Last Dreamers \u6d41\u6d6a\u5317\u4eac (Liulang Beijing, 1990) was widely considered the inaugurating piece of New Documentary Movement in China. In 2005, Wu co-founded the Caochangdi Workstation \u8349\u5834\u5730\u5de5\u4f5c\u7ad9 and coordinated villagers to record \u201cfolk memories\u201d (minjian jiyi \u6c11\u9593\u8a18\u61b6) of grassroots democracy in China.The Chinese Journalists\u2019 Day was first established on 8 November 2000 to commemorate the 63th anniversary of China Youth News Reporters\u2019 Association (Zhongguo qingnian xinwen jizhe xiehui \u4e2d\u570b\u9752\u5e74\u65b0\u805e\u8a18\u8005\u5354\u6703, est. 1937, renamed All-China Journalists Association \u4e2d\u83ef\u5168\u570b\u65b0\u805e\u5de5\u4f5c\u8005\u5354\u6703 in 1957). The eight award-winning journalists in 2003 were Chen Feng \u9673\u5cf0 (b. 1972), Ji Huiyan \u5180\u60e0\u5f65 (b. 1951), Jiang Xue \u6c5f\u96ea (b. 1974), Wang Keqin \u738b\u514b\u52e4 (b. 1964), Zhu Yu \u6731\u7389 (b. late 1960s), Zhao Shilong \u8d99\u4e16\u9f8d (b. 1967), Qu Changyang \u66f2\u9577\u7e93 (b. late 1960s), and Chai Jing \u67f4\u975c.A public intellectual is an intellectual who has \u201cpublicly criticized or deviated from party policies\u201d and is viewed as \u201cthe conscience of society\u201d (Goldman 660). According to Goldman (661\u2013662), there were no laws to protect public intellectuals in Chinese history and some of the intellectuals that Mao persecuted and that were later rehabilitated in the 1980s were the earliest public intellectuals in post-Mao China. Although contemporary Chinese public intellectuals have been silenced or purged continuously, they have been able to spread their ideas through private publishing, the internet, and working out contracts with Hong Kong and foreign media since the reform. In September 2004, Southern People\u2019s Weekly (Nanfang renwu zhoukan \u5357\u65b9\u4eba\u7269\u9031\u520a) published a list of China\u2019s \u201cTop Fifty Public Intellectuals.\u201d The list included contemporary media people such as Dai Huang \u6234\u714c (1928\u20132016), Hu Shuli \u80e1\u8212\u7acb (b. 1953), Wen Tiejun \u6e29\u94c1\u519b (b. 1951), Wu Si \u5434\u601d (b. 1957), Xie Yong \u8c22\u6cf3 (b. 1961), and Yang Jinlin \u6768\u9526\u9e9f (b. 1954).Zhu Jun\u2019s show led to a series of public discussion about \u201ctriggering emotions,\u201d which mostly focused on his motivations and sincerity. In 2005, he became a target of vehement criticism after Cui Yongyuan \u5d14\u6c38\u5143 (b. 1963), one of China\u2019s best known media people, mentioned in an interview that one of his CCTV colleagues had some very disrespectful comments on the crying interviewees\u2019 of a talk show; many linked Cui\u2019s remarks to Zhu\u2019s show and accused Zhu of this presumed wrongdoing. In a 2014 interview, Zhu dismissed this link and argued that triggering emotions actually requires powerful emotional involvement and is a \u201cserious business\u201d (yansu de shi \u56b4\u8085\u7684\u4e8b).Chai\u2019s reference to Al Gore was not always positive, though. In Insight, Chai mentioned that she imitated Lesley Stahl\u2019s interview of Al Gore at CBS \u201c60 Minutes\u201d in her own coverage of a polluted water case in Fujian \u798f\u5efa (Chai 176). Specifically, Stahl asked Gore \u201cSo you\u2019re gonna grow your beard back?\u201d at the end of an eight-minute interview about whether Gore intended to run the 2004 president race. Chai noted that Stahl\u2019s question intended to expose how a politician cannot provide a straight answer even to the simplest question. Chai concluded her own interview of an official who tried to brush away the pollution issue by asking him, \u201cSo you said you cannot smell [the pungent air]?\u201d The official answered, \u201cMy nose is not as sensitive as yours,\u201d and Chai smiled, as Stahl did at the end of the Gore interview.Cui Shuqin was the first critic to propose an ecofeminist reading of Chai\u2019s documentary.\n\n",
