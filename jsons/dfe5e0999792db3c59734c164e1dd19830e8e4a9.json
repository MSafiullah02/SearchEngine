Cases have now been detected in almost all countries in Asia, Australia, Europe, and North America. As of March 16, 2020, laboratories in Italy have diagnosed more than 27,000 people affected by the disease, with 2,158 deaths. Many infected patients do not have symptoms, so it is difficult to estimate the case fatality rate. In patients hospitalized for severe symptoms, the case fatality rate is around 15%. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] Elderly patients with severe comorbidities are at higher risk for mortality. Children and young adults rarely have symptoms, but they can carry the virus.",
