Besides SARS, there are many kinds of infectious diseases, such as tuberculosis, cholera, and influenza, that challenge our vulnerable world frequently. According to data from World Health Organization (WHO), about 1 billion people worldwide are affected by one or more infectious diseases. Each year, almost 9 million people are killed, many of whom are children under five; furthermore, some infectious diseases cause life\u2010long disability.2 The situation is serious for developed and developing countries alike. In addition to naturally occurring diseases, biothreats and biochemical warfare agents also pose a threat,3 as exemplified by the anthrax spores attacks through the US mail system in 2001. Unfortunately, our knowledge of infectious diseases is still inadequate in terms of fully predicting and controlling epidemic events. One of the important factors hampering the control of infectious disease is a lack of effective diagnosis; in order to stop the infectious diseases and biothreats before they spread, it is of critical important to develop diagnostic tests that are fast, cheap, miniaturized, accurate, and suitable for the direct use in developing countries, remote areas, and for global surveillance.4 In the past decades, much progress has been made to address this problem; most serious epidemics have been contained through global alerts and cooperation.",

Coincidentally, nanotechnology provides an excellent platform in the nanometer range (1\u2013100 nm) to improve the detection and identification of infectious diseases and biothreats.

Then, Storhoff's group expanded this method to the detection of unamplified mecA in methicillin\u2010resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA; the first outbreaks of infection occurred in Europe in early 1960s, and it has since spread worldwide)8 genomic DNA samples.9 Just like Mirkin's colorimetric assay, two types of DNA probes were immobilized on gold nanoparticles and used to hybridize to adjacent regions on the mecA sequence. In the presence of mecA target, a red\u2010to\u2010purple color change was observed because of the target\u2010induced aggregation of gold nanoparticles. This result confirmed that this method is selective enough to identify the specific target in the presence of total genomic DNA isolated from MRSA. While, as a negative control, the total genomic DNA from methicillin\u2010sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) strains did not bring any color change. An impressive detection limit was obtained and as few as 20 000 targets could be detected specifically in total bacterial genomic DNA without any signal amplification. Lai's group developed a similar method to identify Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) and MTB complex (MTBC). Impressively, they collected 600 clinic sputum specimens and detected the relative DNA targets. Through comparing the results to the traditional culture and biomedical methods, their assay showed a 96.6% sensitivity and 98.9% specificity towards detection of MTBC, and a 94.7% sensitivity and 99.6% specificity for detection of MTB.10 After developing the gold nanoparticle\u2010based assay for tuberculosis, Baptista et al. estimated the overall cost was less than $0.35 per sample, which is much cheaper than for other molecular methods.11\n",

As a successful integration, Chan et al. combined DNAzyme amplification with colorimetric coupling of surface plasmons of gold nanoparticles for point\u2010of\u2010care detection of infectious diseases.12 This method is based on a catalytic DNAzyme which is much cheaper and more stable than its protein counterparts. Furthermore, the simple colorimetric readout ensures this method is instrument\u2010free. As shown in Figure\n\n2\n, without the genetic target, the DNAzyme is disassembled into two parts (A and B) and has no cleavage activity on its substrate DNA strands (linker DNA); then, the gold nanoparticles conjugated with complementary strands to linker DNA can be bridged together and form aggregates, so the color turns blue. If the target is present, the components of DNAzyme assemble together and catalyze the cleavage of multiple linker DNAs; then, the gold nanoparticles disperse well because of the absence of the linker DNAs, so the color remains red. By rational design of the recognition arms and linker DNA, this method can be easily generalized to other DNA targets. They detected multiple DNA targets for infectious diseases (gonorrhea, syphilis bacteria, malaria parasite, and hepatitis B virus) in a multiplexed manner. This method inherently requires no complex equipment, expensive reagents, or complicated operations, making it suitable for point\u2010of\u2010care diagnosis.",

In an initial state, the stabilized gold nanoparticles dispersed well in solution and had red color. In the present of cholera toxin, the binding of cholera toxin and lactose induced the aggregation of gold nanoparticles, which broadened the surface plasmon adsorption band; as a result, the color changed to deep purple.

Thus, the double helices were separated from the gold nanoparticles due to electrostatic repulsion. As a result, the aggregation of gold nanoparticles and a color change were observed.14 A similar mechanism was later used by the same group to detect human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); however this time they used gold nanorods instead and achieved a detection limit of 100 pm.15\n",

Usually the antibodies are physically adsorbed onto the surface of gold nanoparticles without losing their binding activity. Sia and co\u2010workers demonstrated a useful and reliable diagnostic device based on antibody\u2013gold nanoparticle conjugates21 (Figure\n\n3\n). First, they immobilized the capture antibodies on a biochip. Then, HIV antigen, the antibody\u2013gold nanoparticle conjugates, silver reagents, and washing buffer were delivered serially through a microfluidic device. The silver solution was used as signal amplification (silver reduction produces amplified signal on gold nanoparticles). Thus, an assay was completed within 20 min.

To further prove the success of their detection, they tested their device in Rwanda (the HIV prevalence is about 3% nationally and even higher \u2013 8% \u2013 in some areas such as Kigali). A small volume of unprocessed whole blood (less than 1 \u03bcL) from patient was used and 70 specimens were collected. They obtained sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 96%.

They obtained a high sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 94%. These results showed the excellent accuracy of their detection in complicated samples with different infection statuses.

In these molecular assays, the targets usually are biomarkers in pathogens; thus, to obtain these biomarkers, multiple extraction and separation steps are required that slow down the speed of detection and limit widespread use in remote settings. To overcome this, a new trend to directly identify the intact pathogens is emerging and recently has been attracting increasing interest. With a simplified process, the direct identification of intact pathogens is rapid and quite straightforward.",

By using the excellent light\u2010scattering of gold nanoparticles, Li's group developed a simple and rapid counting method based on dark\u2010field imaging of E. coli. The whole detection process could be finished within 15\u201330 min which is impressive, and the detection limit was 2 \u00d7 104 colony forming units (CFU) per mL.34 Specifically, they used anti\u2010DH5\u03b1 strain polyclonal antibody modified gold nanoparticles as probes (the antibody and the gold nanoparticle were covalently bridged through 11\u2010mercaptoundecanoic acid.). These probes directly bound to the target E. coli DH5\u03b1 with satisfactory selectivity (Figure\n\n4\n). As a control, another strain of E. coli BL21 and Rosetta were used. Through manual counting, they found that 77% of E. coli DH5\u03b1 was targeted by the gold nanoparticles probes, while less than 15% was targeted for the other two strains. The possible reason for the non\u2010specific binding to other strains may be the relatively poor specificity of the polycolonal antibody. If some monoclonal antibodies or aptamers could be used, this method may be improved in specificity.",

For some infectious diseases, the lack of fast, cheap, sensitive, and specific biosensors is still a major problem. With the development of nanotechnology, we are happy to see recent advancements in the detection of infectious diseases. The application of color changes of gold nanoparticles provides a quite straightforward way to identify antigens and nucleic acids just using the naked eyes. This is potentially important for the screening of infectious diseases all over the world. In some resource\u2010limited countries and remote areas, this is equally important because it is an instrument\u2010free method and a power source is not required. On the other hand, the signal amplification through gold nanoparticles improves the sensitivity of biosensors which can be used effectively in the earliest stage of the infection. The direct idendification of pathogens provides a quite straightforward way to detect infectious diseases, which is very important for the control of diseases before they spread.
