The behavior of each of these two processes has been explored independently of one another for the last decades, and many of their propagation properties on diverse complex topologies are well established already (see [2] and [3] for recent reviews on opinion formation and epidemic spreading, respectively). However, less attention has been paid to a possible case scenario where the dynamics of opinions interact with that of the disease spreading. In fact, it is hardly expected that these two dynamics are isolated in real societies but rather depend on and affect each other, since they both run at the same time on the same population: an individual can transmit a disease to a colleague while having a conversation and exchanging ideas or opinions on a given topic. Then, the following questions arise: Does the dynamics of opinion formation have an impact on the extent and prevalence of the epidemic? Does the disease spread facilitate the ultimate dominance of one opinion, or does it rather hinder the consensus of opinions?",

            "text": "In an attempt to explore these questions, we study in this article how opinion formation and disease spreading processes affect each other, using two simple models as a proxy of each process: the voter model (VM) and the contact process (CP). The VM was originally introduced as the simplest system of interacting particles that can be exactly solvable in any dimension [4\u20136], and is one of the most studied models for opinion consensus. In this model, individuals can take one of two possible positions or opinions on a given issue, and are allowed to update them by adopting the opinion of a randomly chosen neighbor. The CP, on its part, has been extensively studied to explore the spread of an infection in a system of interacting agents [7], where infected agents can transmit the infection to susceptible neighbors in a lattice [8] or a complex network [9], and they can also recover at a given rate. The CP exhibits a continuous transition from a healthy to an endemic phase when the infection rate exceeds a threshold value. To model the interaction between the two dynamics we implement the framework of multilayer complex networks [10\u201312] that consists of a set of complex networks interrelated with one another, which allows us to study systems composed by many interdependent processes. In the present study we consider that the opinion dynamics takes place on a network of social relations\u2014formed by individuals that influence each other on a social issue, while the disease spreads on a network of physical contacts\u2014formed by people having daily face-to-face contacts. All individuals are in both layers of networks, but the pattern of connections between them may be different in each layer. The overlap of connections is taken as a measure of the coupling between the two networks.",

The different combinations of connections may correspond to different types of relationships between two individuals. For instance, two close friends can have both a contact and social tie, as they can see each other at work every day and also interchange ideas on a political issue. But it can also happen that individuals are connected by only one type of tie, e.g., two colleagues having a contact or proximity relation because they work in the same place but never talk about politics, or two friends that never meet but discuss political ideas by electronic means (phone, Facebook, Twitter, email, etc).",

[13,14] the authors analyzed how the awareness of a disease affects the epidemic spreading on a multiplex network, by using the unaware-aware-unaware and the susceptible-infected-susceptible cyclic models, respectively. The interplay between opinion formation and decision making processes was studied in [15] using two interconnected networks. Another work considered two political parties (two interacting networks) that compete for votes in a political election [16]. In a recent article [17], the authors studied the dynamics of the voter model on bilayer networks with coevolving connections, while in [18] the same authors explored whether it is appropriate to reduce the dynamics of the voter model from a two-layer multiplex network to a single layer. A recent work [20] considers a complex threshold dynamics that competes with a simple susceptible-infected-susceptible dynamics on two interconnected networks. All the works listed above explore the interplay between two social or two epidemiological processes that are alike. However, there is a lack of specific studies on the interplay between opinion and disease dynamics.",

            "text": "In this article we show that the dynamics of opinions has striking consequences on the disease spreading and vice versa. The nature of the healthy-endemic transition observed in the CP, as the infection probability increases, is largely modified by the dynamics of the VM. The transition changes from continuous to discontinuous when the disease and opinions are coupled, showing a jump in the disease prevalence at the transition point, where the magnitude of the jump increases with the coupling. Also, a discontinuous transition from an endemic to a healthy phase is found when the coupling overtakes a threshold value. In addition, we find that the dynamics of the CP has important consequences on the dynamical properties of the VM. The diffusion of opinions is slowed down by the disease in a nontrivial manner as the coupling increases. This leads to consensus times that vary either monotonically or nonmonotonically with the coupling, for a large range of the model's parameters. We develop a mean-field approach to study the time evolution of macroscopic quantities, which takes into account state correlations between neighbors in the same network (pair approximation). This approach reveals that the interdependent system of opinions and disease can be thought of as two independent systems, with external parameters that depend on the coupling. Specifically, the opinion dynamics can be approximated as the dynamics of the VM on an isolated network, with an effective probability of opinion transmission that decreases with the coupling and the prevalence. Analogously, the disease spreading is approximately described by the CP dynamics on an isolated network, with an effective infection probability that decreases with the coupling and the fraction of neighbors with different opinions.",

The overlap of links is measured by the fraction q (0\u2264q\u22641) of links shared by both networks.

To build this particular topology, we start by connecting the same pairs of nodes at random in both networks until the number of links reaches the overlap value q\u03bcN/2. Then, the rest of the links (1\u2212q)\u03bcN/2 are randomly placed between nodes in each network separately, making sure that the chosen pair of nodes in one network is not already linked in the other network.",

On the one hand, we assume that each individual is less influenced by its partner when she/he is sick, because the sick partner normally stays at home or at hospitals, reducing physical contacts between them. This makes social relations (and the interchange of opinions) less likely when at least one of the two individuals is sick. Thus, we consider that a social relation takes place with probability 1.0 if both social neighbors are healthy, and with a reduced probability po\u22641.0 when one or both are sick. In case they have a social contact but not a physical contact (they do not see each other but discuss ideas by electronic means), the disease state is not supposed to affect the probability of social interactions between them. Therefore, the social interaction probability is not reduced by the disease and, for simplicity, is set to 1.0 as in the case of healthy neighbors.",

            "text": "On the other hand, we consider that physical contacts (and therefore infections) between the two social and contact neighbors are more likely to happen when they share the same opinion. This is a consequence of a sociological mechanism called homophily [21\u201323], i.e., the tendency for individuals to interact with similar others. The effects of homophily in the propagation of cultural attributes in a society were studied by Alxerod using an agent-based model [21], in which the probability that two neighboring agents interact is proportional to their cultural similarity (the number of shared attributes). Following this idea, we assume that the contact probability between the neighbors when they have the same opinion is higher than that when they have different opinions. Therefore, we set to 1.0 the contact probability of same-opinion neighbors and denote by pd\u22641.0 the contact probability between opposite-opinion neighbors. Once they have a physical contact the infection is transmitted with probability \u03b2, leading to effective infection probabilities \u03b2 and \u03b2pd\u2264\u03b2 in each respective case. In a situation where there is a contact but not a social connection between two neighbors (they see each other but they do not talk about politics), opinions are not expected to affect (neither increase or decrease) the contact probability. Therefore, this can be considered as an intermediate situation respect to the two cases mentioned above, where the contact probability should be smaller than 1.0 but larger than pd, leading to an infection probability between \u03b2 and \u03b2pd. However, for simplicity we assume that the contact probability in the absence of a social relation is the same as that in homophilic relations (1.0), and thus the infection probability takes the value \u03b2. This approximation and the one mentioned above for the social interaction probability have the advantage of reducing the number of free parameters, allowing for a deeper analysis of the model which already exhibits a very rich behavior as we shall see.",

In Fig. 3 we show the stationary fraction of infected nodes averaged over many independent realizations of the dynamics, \u2329\u03c11stat\u232a, as a function of the infection probability \u03b2. For this first set of simulations we used po=pd=0, which corresponds to the extreme case scenario where opinions cannot be transmitted across contact neighbors (nodes connected by a contact link) that are infected, and infections are not allowed between social neighbors (nodes connected by a social link) with different opinions. Different curves correspond to different values of the coupling parameter q and network size N, as indicated in the legend. We observe that, for q=0.4 (diamonds) and q=0.7 (triangles), \u2329\u03c11stat\u232a decreases smoothly with \u03b2 until a point \u03b2qc that depends on q, where it suddenly decays to a value close to zero. The sudden decrease in \u2329\u03c11stat\u232a becomes more abrupt as N increases, leading to a discontinuous change of \u2329\u03c11stat\u232a at \u03b2qc in the thermodynamic limit (N\u2192\u221e). This behavior is reminiscent of a discontinuous transition. We also see that the jump in \u2329\u03c11stat\u232a decreases with q and vanishes for the uncoupled case q=0, where the transition becomes continuous, in agreement with the known behavior of the CP on isolated networks.

Solid lines in Fig. 4 correspond to results for networks of size N=104.

            "text": "As we explain below, the origin of the nonmonotonic behavior of \u2329\u03c11stat\u232a is in the dynamic nature of the infection probability during each single realization, which can take two possible values: either the value \u03b2pd=0 across a contact link that overlaps with a +\u2212 social link, or the value \u03b2 otherwise (simulations correspond to pd=po=0). In other words, the infectivity across a given link i\u2212j may switch between 0 and \u03b2 over time, depending on the opinion states of nodes i and j. This gives an average infection rate over the entire system that fluctuates according to the evolution of the fraction of +\u2212 links, \u03c1+\u2212(t), in one realization. We shall exploit this observation in Sec. IV to develop a mean-field (MF) approach for the evolution of the system. In panels (b) and (c) of Fig. 4 we plot \u03c11 and \u03c1+\u2212 in a single realization of the dynamics, for q=0.4 and two values of \u03b2. For \u03b2=0.60>\u03b20.4c [panel (b)] we observe that \u03c11 displays large variations up to a time T\u22434570 (vertical dashed line) where \u03c1+\u2212 becomes 0, after which \u03c11 fluctuates around a stationary value \u03c11stat\u22430.255 (horizontal dash-dotted line), while for \u03b2=0.57<\u03b20.4c [panel (c)] \u03c11 rapidly decays to zero, before \u03c1+\u2212 reaches zero. When \u03c1+\u2212 becomes zero [panel (b)] only ++ or \u2212\u2212 links remain and, therefore, the disease dynamics behaves as the one of the standard CP with infection probability \u03b2=0.6 across all links, reaching the stationary value \u03c11stat(q=0,\u03b2=0.6)\u22430.255. We can say that after time T the disease dynamics uncouples from the opinion dynamics. Indeed, panel (b) also shows \u03c11 in a single realization on an isolated network (q=0) with \u03b2=0.6, where we observe a very quick decay to a stationary value that overlaps with the one for the coupled case q=0.4. Therefore, as we can see in Fig. 3, the value of \u03c11stat in the endemic phase of the coupled system (\u03b2>\u03b20.4c) is the same as in the uncoupled case. Then, at the transition point \u03b20.4c\u22430.58>\u03b20c\u22430.53, \u03c11stat jumps from the value \u03c11stat(q=0,\u03b20.4c)\u22430.22 corresponding to the uncoupled system, to the small value \u03c11stat\u22430.027, showing a discontinuous change. This particular behavior of \u03c11stat is the origin of the discontinuous transitions for q>0 shown in Fig. 3.",

            "text": "In Sec. IV we develop a MF approach that allows us to estimate the stationary fraction of infected nodes \u03c11 [see Eq. (11)]. The theoretical approximation from Eq. (11), shown as a dashed curve in each panel of Fig. 5, describes a continuous transition with \u03b2, in contrast with the discontinuity found in numerical simulations (solid symbols). This is because the MF approach assumes an infinitely large system (N=\u221e) where finite-size fluctuations are neglected, while simulations correspond to the limit of very large (but still finite) systems (N\u226b1). Fluctuations in finite networks ultimately drive the system to an absorbing state in which all nodes are susceptible (\u03c11=0) and have either opinion + or \u2212 (\u03c1+\u2212=0), i.e., an opinion consensus on a completely healthy population. Therefore, fluctuations play a fundamental role in the discontinuous nature of the transition because, as previously discussed, the stationary value of \u03c11 in a single realization depends on whether \u03c1+\u2212 becomes zero before \u03c11 does. To gain a better understanding of the results obtained from the MF theory we run simulations on very large networks. Open circles in Fig. 4 correspond to single realizations on a network of N=106 nodes, for the same values of \u03b2 as for networks with N=104 nodes (solid lines). We observe that curves for N=106 decay monotonically with time to a stationary value denoted by \u03c11,\u221estat (only shown for \u03b2=0.6), which agrees with the minimum of the nonmonotonic curves for N=104. We need to note that these states are not truly stationary, in the sense that \u03c11 exhibits a very long plateau (outside the shown scale) but eventually increases and reaches the same stationary value \u2329\u03c11stat\u232a of the curves for N=104. We have checked that the length of the plateau diverges with N, and thus is infinitely large when N=\u221e. Therefore, we take \u03c11,\u221estat as the stationary value when N=\u221e. In Fig. 5 we observe that the numerical values \u03c11,\u221estat (open symbols) agree reasonably well with the theoretical approximation from Eq. (11) (dashed curves) for the three values of q, even though the agreement worsens as q gets larger. We also see that \u03c11,\u221estat decays continuously as \u03b2 decreases and becomes zero at the same value \u03b2qc of the transition in the thermodynamic limit corresponding to \u03c11stat (filled symbols). That is, the healthy-endemic transition is continuous in an infinite system.\n",

            "text": "Up to here we have studied the response of the system when the infection probability is varied, for a fixed coupling. We now explore the effects of having a varying coupling on disease prevalence. In Fig. 6(a) we plot \u2329\u03c11stat\u232a on two coupled networks of N=104 nodes (circles), and \u03c11stat in a single realization on networks of size N=106 (squares), as a function of the coupling q, for \u03b2=0.6. The upper curve for N=104 shows an abrupt transition from an endemic to a healthy phase as the coupling overcomes a threshold value q0.6c\u22430.5. To explore this behavior in more detail, we show with dots the value of \u03c11stat in every single realization for three values of q. For q=0.2, all dots fall around its mean value \u2329\u03c11stat\u232a\u22430.26, while for q=0.8 they are at \u03c11stat=0. At the transition point q0.6c the distribution of dots is bimodal, i.e., dots are around \u03c11stat\u22430.26 and at \u03c11stat=0, giving an average value \u2329\u03c11stat\u232a\u22430.165. This is evidence of a discontinuous transition. The reason for this discontinuity is the nonmonotonic time evolution of \u2329\u03c11\u232a [see Fig. 6(b)], similarly to what happens when \u03b2 is varied, as shown before. The only difference with this previous studied case is that, as \u03b2 is fixed, the stationary value of \u03c11 in single realizations does not change with q, but is either \u03c11stat=0 or \u03c11stat\u22430.26, in agreement with the binomial distribution. The former situation happens in realizations where \u03c11 hits zero before \u03c1+\u2212 does, while the later corresponds to realizations where \u03c1+\u2212 becomes zero and thus the two dynamics get uncoupled, after which \u03c11 reaches a stationary value similar to 0.26 corresponding to q=0. Figure 6(a) shows that the transition with q is continuous in an infinitely large system (squares). One can also check that the stationary value \u03c11stat for a given q in an infinite system agrees with the minimum of the corresponding \u2329\u03c11\u232a vs. time curve of Fig. 6(b). This behavior is akin to the one shown in Fig. 4(a).\n",

As the fraction of +\u2212 links decreases faster when opinions are copied at a higher rate, one expects an increase of the effective infection rate and, consequently, an enlargement of the endemic phase.",

As the transmission of opinions between neighboring nodes is more difficult when at least one of them is sick, we are particularly interested in studying to what extent the disease slows down opinion diffusion over the social network, and how that depends on q,\u03b2,po, and pd. A way to quantify this is by looking at the time to reach opinion consensus. In Fig. 8 we show how the mean consensus time \u03c4 varies with the coupling q, for infection probability \u03b2=0.6 and various values of po and pd. For a better comparison with the voter model on an isolated network, \u03c4 is normalized by the mean consensus time \u03c40 when the networks are uncoupled (q=0). Symbols correspond to MC simulations, while solid lines are the analytical approximations from Eq. (17) obtained in Sec. IV. Here we present results for \u03b2 above the critical point of an isolated network \u03b20c\u22430.53 because for \u03b2<\u03b20c the effects of disease on consensus times are negligible. This happens because for \u03b2<\u03b20c and any value of q the disease quickly disappears on the contact network and, as all nodes are susceptible, the dynamics of opinions is decoupled from the disease dynamics, reaching consensus in a time very similar to the one in the uncoupled case (\u03c4\u2243\u03c40).\n",

This is a consequence of the competition between two different mechanisms that directly affect opinion transmission. One is the link overlap between the two networks that is proportional to q, and the other is the disease prevalence that decreases with q, as we explain below. The opinion transmission through a social link that overlaps with a contact link is slowed down when at least one of the two nodes is infected and po<1. Therefore, the overall delay in opinion transmission caused by the total overlap tends to increase with q, and so does \u03c4. This effect explains the initial monotonic increase of \u03c4 as q increases from 0, in all curves. However, as q becomes larger a second effect becomes important: the fraction of infected nodes decreases with q [see inset of Fig. 8(a)], due to the coupling with the opinion dynamics that reduces the effective infection probability as discussed in Sec. III A. Then, lower disease prevalence translates into fewer social links affected by the disease and, therefore, into a smaller opinion delay. This effect tends to reduce \u03c4 with q.",

For instance, in Fig. 8(a) we observe that the three curves for po=0.0 have a quite different behavior. For pd=1.0 the effect of prevalence does not vary with q, given that \u03c11stat is independent of q [inset of Fig. 8(a)]. Then, \u03c4 increases monotonically with q as the overlap increases. For pd=0.5 the prevalence effect increases with q (\u03c11stat decreases), becoming dominant for q above 0.8 when \u03c4 decays, and leading to a nonmonotonic behavior of \u03c4(q). Finally, for p0=0.0 we observe a nonmonotonicity similar than that of the pd=0.5 curve, but with the addition that \u03c4 becomes very similar to \u03c40 for all values of q>0.6. This is because \u03c11stat becomes zero above q\u22430.583 and thus the disease has no effect on opinions, leading to consensus times similar to the ones measured in isolated networks. These behaviors for the po=0.0 case are also observed for other values of po, as we show in Fig. 8(b) for po=0.5. We see that the shape of the curves for pd=0.0, 0.5, and 1.0 are analogous to the ones of Fig. 8(a) for the corresponding values of pd. However, consensus times are smaller for the po=0.5 case because the delay in opinion transmission is reduced as po increases.",

A second observation is that \u03c4 decreases with the likelihood of opinion transmission po, as explained before when we compared \u03c4 in Fig. 8(a) with Fig. 8(b). A third observation is that \u03c4 approaches a value independent of pd when \u03b2 goes to 1.0. This is because for \u03b2=1.0 (recovery probability equals zero) and a fixed value of q and po, all nodes are infected at the stationary state, independently of the value of pd, and thus consensus times are the same for all pd. As we see in Fig. 9(b), the case q=1 and po=0 is special because \u03c4 diverges as \u03b2 approaches 1.0. This happens because in this situation the transmission of opinions is only possible between connected nodes that are both susceptible, which vanish in the \u03b2\u21921.0 limit, leading to divergent consensus times. A rough estimation of how \u03c4 scales with \u03b2 can be obtained by assuming that \u03c4 is proportional to the time scale associated with the opinion transmission across two given neighboring nodes in the social network, i and j, with opinions + and \u2212, respectively. As q=1,i and j are also neighbors in the contact network. Starting from a situation where i and j are infected for high \u03b2, the opinion transmission happens after both nodes recover. Therefore, \u03c4 is determined by the time it takes the 1-1 contact link to become a 0-0 link, which scales as (1\u2212\u03b2)\u22122. In Sec. IV we derived a more accurate expression for \u03c4 that exhibits this quadratic divergence in the \u03b2\u21921 limit, shown in the inset of Fig. 9(b) by solid lines.\n",

            "text": "In order to study how the opinion dynamics affects the disease prevalence, we find the fraction of infected nodes at the stationary state \u03c11stat from Eqs. (3) and (5). We start by setting the four time derivatives to zero, substituting \u03c110 by 2(1\u2212\u03b2)\u03c11/\u03b3\u03b2 from Eq. (5a) into Eq. (5b), and solving for \u03c11. After doing some algebra we obtain two solutions, but only one is stable depending on the values of the parameters. The nontrivial solution\n(7)\u03c11stat=(\u03bc\u22121)\u03b3+\u03bc\u03b2\u2212\u03bc(\u03bc\u22121)\u03b3+1\u03b2\u22121corresponds to the endemic phase, where a fraction of nodes is infected, and is stable only when the numerator \u03bb\u2261(\u03bc\u22121)\u03b3+\u03bc\u03b2\u2212\u03bc is larger than zero. For \u03bb<0 the stable solution is \u03c11stat=0, corresponding to the healthy phase where all nodes are susceptible, while \u03bb=0 indicates the transition point between the endemic and the healthy phase. The expression for \u03c11stat from Eq. (7) is still not closed because it depends on \u03c1+\u2212, through the prefactor \u03b3. From Eq. (3b) we see that the fraction of +\u2212 social links reaches a stationary value given by the expression\n(8)\u03c1stat+\u2212=2(\u03bc\u22122)(\u03bc\u22121)\u03c1+(0)[1\u2212\u03c1+(0)],where we used \u03c1+=\u03c1+(0) given that \u03c1+ remains constant over time, as mentioned before. We notice that \u03c9 does not affect the stationary value of \u03c1+\u2212, which remains the same as in the original VM [29]. For a symmetric initial condition on the social layer (\u03c1+(0)=1/2), as the one used in the simulations, we have \u03c1stat+\u2212=(\u03bc\u22122)/[2(\u03bc\u22121)]. Replacing this last expression for \u03c1stat+\u2212 in Eq. (6) we obtain the following expression for \u03b3:\n(9)\u03b3=1\u2212q(1\u2212pd)(\u03bc\u22122)2(\u03bc\u22121).Finally, plugging Eq. (9) into Eq. (7) we arrive at the following approximate expression for the stationary fraction of infected nodes in the endemic phase:\n(10)\u03c11stat=2(2\u03bc\u22121)\u2212q(1\u2212pd)(\u03bc\u22122)\u03b2\u22122\u03bc2\u03bc\u2212q(1\u2212pd)(\u03bc\u22122)\u03b2\u22122.For a network of mean degree \u03bc=10 and pd=0, Eq. (10) is reduced to the simple expression\n(11)\u03c11stat=19\u22124q\u03b2\u22121010\u22124q\u03b2\u22121,which is plotted in Figs. 5 and 6 (dashed curves). As the MF theory is meant to work for infinitely large systems, we also plot for comparison the numerical results obtained from simulations for very large networks (open symbols). We observe that, in all cases, the estimated theoretical value of the fraction of infected nodes from Eq. (11) is larger than that from simulations. As we explain below, this due to the fact that correlations between opinion and disease states are neglected by the MF approach. We first notice that an infection event 0\u21921 between two neighbors connected by a social and a contact link is only possible when the states of nodes are +1 and +0 (a ++10 pair) or \u22121 and \u22120 (a \u2212\u221210 pair), because pd=0 in Figs. 5 and 6. Then, it is expected that ++ social links are negatively correlated with 10 contact links and positively correlated with 11 and 00 contact links, given that same-opinion neighbors tend to infect each other and thus, at a given time, they are more likely to be either both infected or both susceptible. However, the theoretical approximation assumes that ++ social links are uncorrelated with 10 contact links (see Appendix A) and, therefore, the estimated probability of finding a ++10 pair is larger than that obtained when negative correlations are considered. The same conclusion also holds for \u2212\u221210 pairs. This leads to a theoretical overestimation of the number of ++10 and \u2212\u221210 pairs and, consequently, to a larger rate of infections which increases the disease prevalence respect to numerical results, as we see in Figs. 5 and 6.",

            "text": "As mentioned in Sec. IV, in infinitely large systems \u03c1+ remains constant over time [see Eq. (3a)]. However, in finite systems \u03c1+ fluctuates until it reaches either value \u03c1+=1 (+ consensus) or \u03c1+=0 (\u2212 consensus), with both configurations characterized by the absence of +\u2212 social links (\u03c1+\u2212=0). A typical evolution of \u03c1+\u2212 towards the absorbing state can be seen in Fig. 4(b) for q=0.4 on networks with N=104 nodes. That is, consensus is eventually achieved in finite systems due to the stochastic nature of the opinion dynamics, which leads the social network to a state where all nodes share the same opinion. In a single opinion update \u03c1+ may increase or decrease by 1/N with the same probability \u03c9\u03c1+\u2212/2, calculated as the probability \u03c1+\u2212/2 that a node and an opposite-opinion neighbor are selected at random, times the probability \u03c9 of opinion adoption. Therefore, the stochastic dynamics of the VM can be studied by mapping \u03c1+ into the position of a symmetric one-dimensional random walker on the interval [0,1], with a jumping probability proportional to \u03c9\u03c1stat+\u2212/2 and a step length of 1/N. Starting from a symmetric configuration with N/2 nodes with + opinion [\u03c1+(0)=1/2], the walker reaches either absorbing point \u03c1+=1 or \u03c1+=0 in an average number of steps that scales as N2. Then, given that the walker makes a single step in an average number of attempts that scales as 1/\u03c9\u03c1stat+\u2212, and that the time increases by 1/N in each attempt, we find that the mean consensus time scales as\n(14)\u03c4\u223cN\u03c9\u03c1stat+\u2212.As we see in Eq. (8), \u03c1stat+\u2212 is independent of the disease prevalence \u03c11 and, therefore, the prevalence affects \u03c4 only through the effective copying probability \u03c9, which sets the time scale associated to opinion updates. From Eq. (4) we see that \u03c9 equals 1.0 when the layers are uncoupled (q=0) or when po=1.0, and thus the dynamics of opinions is exactly the same as that of the original VM. However, \u03c9 is smaller than 1.0 in the presence of coupling (q>0) and po<1.0, and thus the evolution of the dynamics is \u201cslowed down\u201d\u2014on average\u2014by a factor 1/\u03c9>1.0, given that opinions are copied at a rate that is \u03c9 times smaller than in the uncoupled case. As a consequence, \u03c4 increases by a factor 1/\u03c9 with respect to the mean consensus time in the uncoupled case \u03c40=\u03c4(q=0)\u223cN/\u03c1stat+\u2212, that is,\n(15)\u03c4\u03c40\u22431\u03c9.To obtain a complete expression for the ratio \u03c4/\u03c40 as a function of the model's parameters we express \u03c9 in terms of \u03c11stat, by substituting into Eq. (4) the stationary value of \u03c110 that follows from Eq. (5a), \u03c110stat=2(1\u2212\u03b2)\u03c11stat/\u03b3\u03b2. This leads to\n(16)\u03c9=1\u2212q(1\u2212po)1+1\u2212\u03b2\u03b3\u03b2\u03c11stat.In the healthy phase \u03c11stat=0, thus \u03c9=1.0 and \u03c4=\u03c40. In this case, the theory predicts that the disease has no effect on the time to consensus because there are no infected nodes that can affect the opinion dynamics. However, having a value \u03c11stat>0 of infected nodes in the endemic phase has the effect of reducing \u03c9 or, equivalently, increasing \u03c4 with respect to \u03c40. Plugging into Eq. (16) the expressions for \u03b3 and \u03c11stat from Eqs. (9) and (10), respectively, and reordering some terms, we obtain the following expression that relates \u03c4 and \u03c40 in the endemic phase:\n(17)\u03c4\u03c40\u22431\u2212q(1\u2212po){2(\u03bc\u22121)\u2212q(1\u2212pd)(\u03bc\u22122)\u03b2}{[2(2\u03bc\u22121)\u2212q(1\u2212pd)(\u03bc\u22122)]\u03b2\u22122\u03bc}\u03b2{2(\u03bc\u22121)\u2212q(1\u2212pd)(\u03bc\u22122)}{[2\u03bc\u2212q(1\u2212pd)(\u03bc\u22122)]\u03b2\u22122}\u22121.In Fig. 8 we plot in solid lines the ratio \u03c4/\u03c40 vs. q from Eq.

A possible explanation of these discrepancies can be given by analyzing how correlations affect the estimated number of different types of connected nodes, as we have done in Sec. IV A for disease prevalence. If we take the p0=0 case, we see that an opinion change due to an interaction between two social and contact neighbors happens only if both nodes are susceptible, that is, when they have states +0 and \u22120. Then, as the theory assumes that +\u2212 social links and 00 contact links are uncorrelated (Appendix A), the estimated probability of finding a +\u221200 pair is larger than that in simulations, given that +\u2212 social links are expected to be negatively correlated with 00 contact links. This negative correlation is due to the fact that susceptible neighbors tend to align their opinions and, therefore, they are more likely to be in the same opinion state at a given time. This leads to an overestimation of the number of +\u221200 pairs and, therefore, to a larger rate of opinion transmission. This has the overall effect of speeding up consensus, decreasing the theoretically estimated mean time to reach consensus with respect to the mean consensus time measured in simulations, as we see in Fig. 8.",

As explained in Sec.

This competition can be seen quantitatively in Eq. (16) for \u03c9, which has three factors that depend on q and affect \u03c4.

The magnitude of the change in the disease prevalence at the transition point \u03b2c increases with q.
