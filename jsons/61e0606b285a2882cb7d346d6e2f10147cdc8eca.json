This impact has extended beyond patient care to include logistics, administration, and distribution of increasingly limited health care resources. Based on the collective experience of the CAR T-cell Consortium investigators, we review and address several questions and concerns regarding cellular therapy administration in the setting of COVID-19 and make general recommendations to address these issues. Specifically, we address (1) necessary resources for safe administration of cell therapies; (2) determinants of cell therapy utilization; (3) selection among patients with B cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas and B cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia; (4) supportive measures during cell therapy administration; (5) use and prioritization of tocilizumab; and (6) collaborative care with referring physicians. These recommendations were carefully formulated with the understanding that resource allocation is of the utmost importance, and that the decision to proceed with CAR T cell therapy will require extensive discussion of potential risks and benefits. Although these recommendations are fluid, at this time it is our opinion that the COVID-19 pandemic should not serve as reason to defer CAR T cell therapy for patients truly in need of a potentially curative therapy.",

Two anti-CD19 CAR T-cell products are currently approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and other international regulatory agencies: axicabtagene ciloleucel (axi-cel; Yescarta \u00d2 ; Kite/Gilead) for the treatment of adult relapsed/refractory (R/R) diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) [2] , and tisagenlecleucel (tisacel; Kymriah \u00d2 ; Novartis Pharmaceuticals), both for adult R/R DLBCL [3] and pediatric R/R ALL [4] . Additional FDA approvals for DLBCL, mantle cell lymphoma, and myeloma are expected in the coming months. To better evaluate cellular therapy treatment strategies, investigators from 8 US academic institutions formed the CAR T-cell Consortium to pool resources to aid the evaluation and optimization of cellular therapy treatment. This group has previously presented data on the safety, efficacy, and resource utilization of cellular therapy in the commercial setting [5] . Through this collaboration, we strive to advance cellular therapy strategies to enhance patients' survival and quality of life.",

These challenges extend to the delivery of potentially life-saving complex treatments, such as CAR T cell therapy. To harmonize opinions on the use and management of CAR T cell therapy during the COVID-19 pandemic, experts from the CAR T-cell Consortium convened to formulate consensus recommendations. In this report, we review the numerous facets of CAR T-cell treatment, including patient selection, delivery, and prioritization of resources during the current COVID-19 pandemic. Although each recommendation might not be uniformly applicable, it is paramount that each treatment facility carefully review internal policies and procedures, and modify and potentially adopt these recommendations as needed to best fit a center's needs.",

Similarly, cellular therapy services should be able to quickly respond to a pandemic, or other major incident, through a centralized and coordinated response that takes into account the unique needs and priorities of the health system. Along with the clinical and logistical complexities inherent to cellular therapy, in the era of COVID-19, or a similar pandemic, additional anticipated challenges include staff shortages due to potential exposure, limitation of resources in personal protective equipment, hospital beds, intensive care unit (ICU) beds, and mechanical ventilation, as well as potential delays in shipment of cellular therapy products. Therefore, careful assessment, planning, allocation of resources, and utilization of existing infrastructure is essential. This mandates a coordinated effort between the cellular therapy program and their hospital's emergency planning group.",

Initiate lymphodepleting chemotherapy only following CAR T cell product receipt onsite, given the potential impact on supply chain operations. Inpatient resources: encourage virtual team rounding and perform one examination per patient per day, if appropriate. In selected patients in whom an exam is unlikely to inform assessment and management, consider forgoing the physical exam. Housing: Ensure a clear plan as to where patients will be housed during the immediate 4 weeks surrounding their CAR T cell therapy, if not returning home. Outpatient follow-up care: Perform outpatient visits via telemedicine, when feasible. Radiology and laboratory services: Minimize all nonessential lab work and radiology appointments. Pharmacy: Preferentially use oral over parenteral administration when appropriate. Pandemic-specific considerations: Ensure the continuous availability of a cellular therapy team member with the capacity to respond to COVID-19 issues. Establish a center-specific workflow for COVID-19-positive patients. Consider creating COVID-19-specific inpatient units with dedicated rounding teams.",

Similarly, high grade (grade 3-4) CRS rates seen in the ELIANA registration trial for tisa-cel were 48%, compared to 14% during recent commercial use [23] . Reasons for lower rates of severe CRS may include earlier referral patterns, where the proportion of refractory patients with high disease burden may be lower. Additionally, earlier CRS intervention with tocilizumab may play a role. A recently published prospective trial of preemptive tocilizumab administration met its predefined study endpoint of 1/3 reduction in grade 4 CRS in patients with a high disease burden, suggesting that earlier CRS management might reduce the risk of severe CRS [24] .

We suggest delaying patients who test positive for a minimum of 14 days from symptom resolution, if feasible, with consideration of interim testing. Whether repeat testing at the 14-day milestone will predict future illness is unclear. After a 14 day delay, options include proceeding with cellular therapy, retesting, and, if positive, considering chest imaging before proceeding or further treatment delays. Proceeding with CAR T cell therapy in an asymptomatic COVID-19-positive patient or in a patient recovering from COVID-19 should be done in collaboration with local infectious disease colleagues and in accordance with current CDC and ASTCT guidelines. Tocilizumab (Actemra \u00d2 ; Genentech), a recombinant monoclonal antibody to the IL-6 receptor, has become the mainstay in management of patients experiencing advanced (grade >2) CRS after CAR T cell therapy [32\u00c035] . FDA approval of tocilizumab was granted based on retrospective data demonstrating that the majority of patients with severe or life-threatening CRS responded to treatment with 1 or 2 doses [36] . Since regulatory approval, there has been a shift toward earlier intervention with tocilizumab in light of data showing a decrease in the severity and duration of CRS without a signal of reduced CAR T cell efficacy [33\u00c035,37] . There are a growing number of anecdotal reports of a possible benefit of tocilizumab in patients with severe respiratory symptoms from COVID-19 [38\u00c040] . Indeed, there are accounts of tocilizumab reducing the duration and severity of COVID-19 symptoms and even permitting weaning from ventilatory support [39] . This has led to the initiation of several clinical trials and the off-label use of tocilizumab in symptomatic COVID-19 patients. This raises a concern that the supply of tocilizumab may become limited, prompting rationing among patients with COVID-19 and patients with other FDA-approved indications.",

In addition, we recommend strongly considering the practice of early tocilizumab use at the onset of grade 2 CRS. Patients undergoing CAR T cell therapy are receiving potentially life-saving treatment; therefore, it is paramount to ensure the availability of tocilizumab to mitigate serious toxicity and the need for advanced supportive care measures. Thought has been given to reducing the dose of tocilizumab in the absence of adequate studies to determine optimal dose and frequency in CRS. Early phase I and II trials of tocilizumab demonstrated efficacy and significant declines in surrogate inflammatory markers with doses as low as 4 mg/kg [41, 42] ; however, subsequent pharmacokinetic studies revealed the observed mean maximum concentration of tocilizumab after the first dose was 41% lower in patients with CRS than in patients with systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis, suggesting faster clearance of tocilizumab in patients experiencing CRS [36] . Therefore, we would not recommend altering the FDA-approved dose at this time. We do, however, recommend that no more than 2 doses of tocilizumab be administered per patient, because the overwhelming majority of patients with grade >3 CRS in the FDA cohorts responded by the second dose. It is surmised that responses may be even higher with early administration. When managing CRS, it is imperative that treating centers be mindful of the potential for limitations in tocilizumab supply. Although many clinical trials of unproven benefit are on hold during the COVID-19 pandemic, we believe that rational studies of CRS prevention and treatment should continue because they may provide significant advantages to patients by improving safety, limiting the need for scarce intensive care support, and preserving a possibly limited supply of tocilizumab. We acknowledge that these assessments and recommendations are fluid and may require modification as tocilizumab availability changes.",

Such measures can alleviate pressure on constrained healthcare resources and optimize care delivery to other high-acuity patients. Other strategies to mitigate exposure include providing referring providers with a detailed overview of the cellular therapy treatment course, highlighting the expected duration of care at the certified treatment center, and expected date of transition back to their community. Similarly, treating institutions should formulate a long-term care plan to help guide continued management by community oncologists.

While the incidence of COVID-19 in the community continues to rise, patients with R/R DLBCL and ALL remain a significant unmet medical need. CAR T cell therapy has emerged as a standard and potentially curative approach for these R/R patients, yet the COVID-19 pandemic presents unique challenges to its implementation and management. Proceeding with CAR T cell therapy during the pandemic will require dedicated discussions of the risks/ benefits while balancing the uncertainty of the near future. If a patient is in need of CAR T cell therapy, and can likely benefit, we affirm that treatment should be provided. There is an assumption that we can wait out this infection crisis, but there are no reliable data demonstrating that this reduction will happen or when it will occur. In a competition for resources, those with R/R DLBCL and ALL will fail when compared with the sheer number of COVID-19-infected patients; therefore, clinicians must continue to strongly advocate for this treatment and their patients. Today, a deferral of CAR T cell therapy, although with temporary intent, could prove to be permanent and thus eliminate an otherwise potentially curative therapy.
