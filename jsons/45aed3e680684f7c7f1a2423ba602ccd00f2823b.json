However, since the beginning of industrialization era, focus on economic development has caused detrimental effects on the environment. Last two centuries have witnessed changes in global environmental factors such as rise in temperature leading to global warming, depletion of stratospheric ozone layer, loss of biodiversity and marked degradation in air and water quality due to atmospheric pollution, thereby causing upsurge in infectious and noninfectious diseases. Environmental health has emerged as an important part of medicine. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that 24% of global disease burden and 23% of all deaths can be attributed to environmental factors. Deaths from heart disease, cancer, respiratory disorders and many vector-borne diseases such as malaria, dengue, chikungunya and cholera have increased due to changes in climate, especially in developing countries. Besides limited attention to sanitation, hygiene, as well as quality of food and drinking water, factors such as deforestation, increasing vehicular traffic, migration from rural to urban areas, decreasing water resources and inadequate drainage systems contribute to increase incidence of diseases. The need of the hour is to sensitize ourselves about the way our ecology is being degraded and the health effects it is causing. A holistic view is needed to address the problem of environmental health where agriculture, animal husbandry, public health, water safety and air pollution need to be looked at in a combined manner for education, planning and resource allocation.

For thousands of years, man has lived in harmony with their natural surroundings. Environment has played a crucial role in his economic, social and cultural behaviour as well as on his health. The role of environment in various diseases has been well documented, both in communicable and non-communicable diseases. Since the dawn of industrialization era in Europe 400 years ago and its subsequent spread to the rest of world, economic development and physical comfort for mankind have increased at a tremendous pace. This increase is perhaps the most rapid over the last three decades. Often this has been done, knowingly or unknowingly, at the cost of our environment. The last 200 years have witnessed a sharp increase in the global temperature from its levels around 4000 years ago, owing to industrialization (Mann et al. 2008; Marcott et al. 2013) . Moreover, other concerns such as depletion of carbon fuels at alarming rates, damage to the ozone layer and rise in seawater levels, combined with global warming, have damaged our environment extensively, leading to changes in the aquatic biodiversity and to the extinction of many species of plants and animals (Thomas et al. 2004) . Increase in urbanization has led to loss of dense forests. Air pollution has risen to the extent that many big cities in the world have a highly toxic air quality. However, very little has been done by various governmental and non-governmental agencies with almost no visible results. The need of the hour is to sensitize the scientific community, as well as the common man, about the way our ecology is being degraded and the health effects it is causing and to suggest ways to get remedies for this situation.",

Almost 42% of acute lower respiratory tract infections in developing countries are attributable to environmental factors.

Water pollution occurs when energy and substances are released and degrades the quality of water for other users. Anything that is added to water, which is more than its capacity to break it down, constitutes water pollution. Anthropogenic activities such as industrial waste effluents, sewage disposal and agricultural activities are some of the major causes of water pollution (Manivasakam 2005; Tilman et al. 2001) . Chemical pollution of surface water causes major health problems as it can be used directly for drinking or it may contaminate shallow wells, used for drinking. Ground water, which is much deeper, has very few pathogens as it gets filtered when it passes through many underground layers. It can be polluted by toxic chemicals such as fluoride and arsenic which may be present in the soil or the rock layers. Similarly, pollution of coastal water can cause contamination of sea food (Guleria 2013) . Changing environment has a serious effect on safe water, affecting not only human health but also changing the ecology of plants. The global effect of water pollution has not been studied in detail and is limited to mainly outbreaks of waterborne infections or certain chemical toxins in limited areas, such as arsenic in drinking water in Bangladesh, 'Minamata' disease in Japan, etc. (Argos et al. 2010; Harada 1995) . The burden of waterborne diseases is grossly underreported in India due to lack of data, poor surveillance and reporting. According to a report from the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, nearly 40 million people are affected by waterborne diseases such as diarrhoea, enteric fever, amoebiasis and helminthic infestations, every year. WHO estimates >330,000 deaths annually, in India alone, due to contaminated water consumption. Moreover, floods and droughts also affect human health. Floods lead to physical injury as well as spread of waterborne diseases such as diarrhoea, enteric fever and viral hepatitis. Overcrowding occurs and sanitation is affected, leading to respiratory infections. Diseases such as malaria and dengue may turn into epidemics. On the other hand, drought leads to lack of sanitation, decreased food production and ultimately malnutrition.",

High levels of carbon monoxide are extremely dangerous to humans, more so because it is colourless, tasteless and odourless and therefore cannot be detected by humans. Early symptoms of carbon monoxide include weakness, headache, nausea, dizziness, confusion, disorientation and visual instability. Carbon monoxide quickly enters the blood stream and forms carboxyhaemoglobin which causes more systemic effects. It reduces oxygen delivery to the tissues and may have a serious health threat to those with underlying heart disease (Badman and Jaff\u00e9 1996) . Prolonged or severe exposure may result in lethal arrhythmias, electrocardiographic changes, pulmonary oedema, various neurological symptoms as well as death, most likely due to cardiac failure.

But now it is becoming clear that persistent exposure to high levels of air pollution may also lead to heart disease. This is especially true for particulate matter. Inflammation in lungs also causes inflammation in the blood, leading to atherosclerosis and an increase incidence of coronary artery disease that may be fatal (Fig. 6.1 ). Many well-conducted studies have demonstrated a 12-25% higher risk of coronary artery disease in individuals exposed to high levels of air pollution, for many years (Cesaroni et al. 2014; Miller et al. 2007 ). This increased risk has been linked to higher levels of PM2.5 in the ambient air. Studies have also looked at subclinical atherosclerosis, which is the pathological process associated with coronary artery disease. A positive association between subclinical atherosclerosis in the carotid and the coronary arteries has been observed with long-term exposure to high levels of air pollution (K\u00fcnzli et al. 2010; K\u00fcnzli et al. 2005) . There is therefore now a significant body of evidence linking air pollution to cardiovascular diseases and increased mortality. Many investigators argue that air pollution should now be considered as a preventable risk factor like smoking and dyslipidemia for the development of coronary artery disease, and steps should be taken to bring down the exposure to air pollution.",

            "text": "Indoor air pollution and its effect on human health are important as individuals spend more than 50% of their time indoors. Cooking is an integral part of indoor human activity. The WHO has estimated that about 50% of the world's population, or about 3 billion people, still uses solid fuel for their household energy needs. Of these, about 2.4 billion people use biological material (wood, charcoal, crop waste and dung), and the remaining use coal. In India, about 58% of the population has been estimated to depend upon wood, and about 11% depend upon dung for energy. Although this number is slowly decreasing and moving towards the use of other fuels such as liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and kerosene, it is still very significant. In India in 2010, of the 1.2 billion people, about 700 million still used solid fuel for cooking or heating. Many studies over the last three decades have documented the link between solid fuel exposure and different respiratory diseases. Lim et al. (2012) estimated more than 100 million premature deaths per year due to indoor air pollution, because of solid fuel used for cooking purposes. Exposure to high concentrations of harmful substances in smoke during use of biomass fuel causes significant illness amongst homemakers and young children. It has been shown that biomass fuel is a less efficient means of energy production and a number of carcinogenic constituents are released during biomass combustion (Chafe et al. 2014; Smith and Sagar 2014) . Inhalation of these particles in high concentration leads to 'lung overloading' and sustained inflammation. This results in the release of reactive oxygen that causes Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage. Indoor smoke produced due to burning of solid fuel contains many pollutants. Particulate matter, nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, benzene, 1.3 butadiene, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, free radicals and volatile organic compounds are many of the toxic substances that have been found in smoke produced by burning solid fuels. Chronic exposure to these harmful substances leads to lung fibrosis and subsequently the development of lung cancer. The evidence for the development of lung cancer due to biomass exposure has been shown in experimental animals, but the evidence in humans is not that strong.",

It comprises of a wide range of equipments and devices falling under 'hazardous' and 'non-hazardous' categories such as computers, mobile phones, refrigerators, washing machines, air conditioners, personal stereos, consumer electronics, etc., that are discarded by users (Puckett et al. 2013) . Pollution due to electronic and electrical waste has rapidly grown over the last decade due to progressive increase in production of electronics, lack of proper disposal facilities in India and dumping of e-waste from developed countries. In 2010 alone, India generated about 0.4 million tons of e-waste (double the amount as compared to 2006), which is progressing rapidly. E-waste may contain many toxic substances which may be harmful to the environment and human health. This can have a significant economic and social impact on society. Iron and steel constitute about 50% of the e-waste followed by plastics (21%), nonferrous metals (13%) and other constituents (10%). Others include nonferrous metals like copper, aluminium, silver, gold, platinum, palladium, etc. The presence of elements such as lead, mercury, arsenic, cadmium, selenium and hexavalent chromium, with flame retardants beyond threshold quantities of e-waste, classifies them as hazardous waste. Manual recycling of e-waste is done predominantly via the unorganized sector, and the work force involved consists predominantly of individuals with low literacy and hardly any training to protect themselves from ill effects and to identify warning signals of toxicity. Accordingly, a significant percentage of health problems due to e-waste results from direct contact with harmful materials and inhalation of toxic fumes. Moreover, these materials may get accumulated in the food and water and are consumed. Heavy metals such as lead can cause kidney failure, neurologic manifestations and hypertension. Mercury toxicity can lead to central and peripheral nervous system damage and hepatic and renal toxicity (Guleria 2013) .",

A holistic view is needed to address the problem of environmental health where agriculture, animal husbandry, public health, water safety and air pollution need to be looked at in a combined manner for education, planning and resource allocation. General population should also be made aware about the ways to reduce harm to our environment. Intergovernmental efforts should be made to check climate change, avoid deforestation and use alternative sources of energy like solar energy instead of petroleum products. Ultimately, as embedded in its definition, ecosystem is a community, and unless all people in community put efforts to conserve it, no amount of individual effort can suffice. Therefore, a close teamwork between scientists, public health professionals and administrators is needed for integrated vertical and horizontal planning.",
