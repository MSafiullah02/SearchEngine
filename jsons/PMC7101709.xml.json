            "text": "Dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is characterised by ventricular chamber enlargement and impaired myocardial function and is one of the leading indications for heart transplantation [40]. Besides genetic predisposition, cardiac viral infections and inflammation play a causal role in the disease process [25, 34, 40]. Furthermore, autoimmune disorders resulting in activation of the cellular and humoral immune response have been implicated in the development of DCM [11, 29]. Antibodies against numerous cardiac proteins have been identified in these patients, indicating an active role in the pathogenesis by virtue of triggering the disease process or by aggravating myocardial contractile dysfunction [28, 45]. Furthermore, in asymptomatic relatives of patients with DCM, detection of cardiac autoantibodies predicts disease development [8, 9]. The pathogenic potential of autoantibodies has been proved in animal models by active immunisation as well as by transfer of antibodies directed against the corresponding epitopes, both leading to dilation and dysfunction of the ventricle [21, 27]. Supporting the functional role of cardiac autoantibodies in DCM, pilot studies showed that the depletion of immunoglobulins from the plasma of patients by immunoadsorption with subsequent immunoglobulin G substitution (IA/IgG) resulted in significant haemodynamic improvements, such as an increase in cardiac index, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) as well as relief of symptoms [16, 17, 49, 50], and improvement of endothelial function [6]. Furthermore, a decrease in activated T-cells and an increase in regulatory T-cells have been shown to be associated with haemodynamic improvement after IA/IgG, revealing a link between cellular and humoral immunity [7]. Recently, cardiac autoantibodies were also detected in a subgroup of peripartum cardiomyopathy patients and may point to similarities in some of the pathophysiological processes, thus also indicating that removal of these antibodies might be a therapeutic option not only in DCM but also in peripartum cardiomyopathy [22].",

Hence, the molecular effects triggered by therapies are of particular interest to understand the underlying mechanisms of haemodynamic improvements. Changes in therapy-related myocardial gene expression patterns have been investigated in patients with heart failure (HF) treated with left ventricular assist device (LVAD) [23, 39] and cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) [42, 53]. Improvement of ventricular function was associated with significant expression changes in a set of myocardial genes involved in maintenance of contractility for CRT [53, 54] and remodelling for LVAD [19]. With respect to medical treatment, another study [37] demonstrated that in patients suffering from idiopathic DCM, improvement in LVEF after treatment with beta-blockers was associated with favourable expression changes of genes encoding sarcoplasmic-reticulum calcium ATPase2\u03b1 (SERCA2\u03b1) and the \u03b1 and \u03b2 isoforms of myosin heavy chain.",

Patients had not suffered from active infectious diseases, cancer, chronic alcoholism, postpartum cardiomyopathy, or HF due to known origins (e.g. primary valvular disease). All patients received stable oral medication for HF according to ESC guidelines [13, 47, 52] and medication was kept stable for the duration of this study with exception of dose adjustments for diuretics (Table 1, see Online Resource Supplemental Material ESM 1). Among all patients, we excluded coronary heart disease by angiography as well as acute myocarditis by endomyocardial biopsy (EMB), in accordance with Dallas criteria and immunohistological stainings [2, 12, 31, 38]. Myocardial biopsies were obtained for clinical reasons for diagnosis of DCM according to guidelines [12, 47] and for assessment of myocardial infections and inflammation after IA/IgG at baseline and during follow-up after 6 months (follow-up, FU). Transcriptome (n = 33) and proteome (subset, n = 23) analyses were performed from endomyocardial biopsies which were no longer needed for routine diagnostics.\n",

Moreover, the number of patients with myocardial inflammation decreased significantly among the responders from BL (n = 14) to FU (n = 6, p = 0.026), and serum NT-pro BNP level was significantly decreased (1035 to 463 pg/ml, p < 0.004) in this group 6 months after treatment compared with BL (Fig. 2). In non-responders, these parameters did not change significantly. The grade of fibrosis in Masson Trichrome stained EMB tissue sections as evaluated by light microscopy did not change in any of the two groups after IA/IgG (Table 2). Individual patient data are shown in Fig. 2.\n\n",

In total, IA/IgG-associated gene expression changes pointed to a rather diverse pattern than an alteration of a defined pathway. Since inflammation and fibrosis are known parameters associated with DCM progression and affected by IA/IgG (Table 2), data were adjusted for these cofactors to screen for effects independent of these two cofactors. We observed a stronger influence of the adjustment for inflammation and fibrosis on the data of responders compared with non-responders (see Online Resource ESM 5 Supplemental Fig. S3). The adjustment for the factors inflammation or fibrosis revealed a decrease in the number of significantly regulated genes and the corresponding p values in responders but triggered only marginal changes in non-responders.

Surprisingly, according to this study, none of these pathways was affected by IA/IgG, neither in responders nor in non-responders (see Online Resource Supplemental Material ESM 15, ESM 5 Supplemental Fig. S5). Only a few genes described as altered in DCM previously [1] were inversely affected in expression after IA/IgG in responders (seven genes: LTBP2, RGS4, SERPINE2, SH3GL2, TAGLN, FAM124A, MRO) and non-responders (six genes: ACTG2, MRO, IDS, MTHFD2L, CREB5, GLG1), respectively (see Online Resource Supplemental ESM 15 and Supplemental Tables ESM 2 and ESM 3).

These findings are in line with observations by Margulies et al. who studied the molecular changes in human pre- and post-LVAD samples [39]. Only a minor proportion of HF-associated alterations exhibited normalisation indicating morphological and functional improvements without reversing pathological expression patterns [39]. Margulies et al. hypothesised that many HF-associated changes in transcript levels have only a limited role in regulation of cardiac structure and function and may represent epiphenomena [39]. In line with this observation, global heart failure-related gene expression patterns were largely unaffected by cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) [4]. However, dyssynchrony-induced expression changes were reversed in a region-specific manner for transcripts and proteins with metabolic and cell signalling function by CRT [4].",

            "text": "Improvement of heart function in the responder group after IA/IgG was associated with a reduced LVIDD, a decrease in inflammation as determined by the number of infiltrating immune cells, and a decreased serum NT-pro BNP level. NT-pro BNP is stimulated by pathophysiological stressors, such as hypoxia, biomechanical stretch or ventricular hypertrophy [56], and is accepted as a biomarker reflecting the severity of HF [46]. The significant downregulation of NPPA and NPPB after IA/IgG that was found in responders exclusively might thus reflect differences in myocardial function of the patient subgroups. CORIN, the gene encoding atrial natriuretic peptide-converting enzyme, which catalyses the conversion of NT-pro ANP and to a lesser extent also NT-pro BNP [14], was found at significant higher levels after IA/IgG in responders compared with BL. Furthermore, CORIN was expressed at higher levels after IA/IgG in responders compared with non-responders which might explain in part the reduced NT-pro BNP levels in this patient subgroup. In a murine DCM model, overexpression of CORIN was associated with improved cardiac function, reduced myocardial fibrosis, and prolonged survival [20]. These observed beneficial effects of increased corin levels might be secondary to the effects of processed natriuretic peptides ANP and BNP. Besides regulation of intravascular blood volume and vascular tone, BNP and ANP also display cardioprotective effects by inhibition of inflammation and cardiac fibrosis, and thus, each of these mechanisms may also influence the progression of dilated cardiomyopathy [43, 55]. Especially, BNP is assumed to act locally as an anti-fibrotic factor by inhibiting collagen synthesis and proliferation of cardiac fibroblasts which, in turn, inhibits cardiac fibrosis [20, 43, 44].",

            "text": "In our study, major alterations were found for extracellular matrix components which were predominantly pronounced in responders and fit well with the observation of a decreased left ventricular diameter indicating myocardial recovery. After IA/IgG, responders showed lower expression of different collagens (Fig. 6) compared with non-responders. Furthermore, in non-responders, lumican levels increased but not in responders (Fig. 7). Increased expression of lumican in the myocardium of patients with HF was recently reported, and a pathophysiological role affecting extracellular matrix (ECM) was suggested by initiating increased ECM collagen cross-linking and cardiac fibrosis [15]. Furthermore, lower expression in responders than in non-responders after IA/IgG was found for the heart failure marker and ECM component periostin which is associated with myocardial fibrosis in human failing hearts [57]. Animal experiments already revealed that inhibition of periostin gene expression resulted in a significant increase in survival rate accompanied by an improvement of LV function [30]. In addition, responders showed a downregulation of the fibrosis-associated gene CTGF [35], which is induced by growth factor TGF-\u03b2 [10]. Expression of TGF-\u03b2-dependent genes and levels of proteins, such as fibronectin (FN1) and different collagens (COL1A1 and COL1A2) [10], were significantly different (Table 3) in responders and non-responders after IA/IgG. Although no direct association of IA/IgG with TGF-\u00df mRNA and protein levels was detected, a higher TGF-\u00df activity in non-responders was predicted independently for proteome as well as transcriptome data. The difference in the molecular remodelling might be caused by a higher expression of latent transforming growth factor binding protein 2 (LTBP2) in non-responders, which was recently described as a new biomarker for heart failure [3]. LTBP2 is part of the latent TGF-\u00df1 complex. As a further component of the extracellular matrix, LTBP2 seems to contribute directly to myocardial remodelling and fibrosis, which was more pronounced in non-responders than in responders 6 months after IA/IgG. Improved LV function after LVAD implant therapy was also associated with reduced transcript levels of pro-fibrotic genes COL1A1 and COL3A1 as well as fibronectin 1 [18]. For extracellular matrix components, similar results were obtained in an LVAD implant study with patients suffering from cardiomyopathy. However, despite reduced levels of mRNA for TGF-\u00df1, CTGF, COL1A1, and COL3A1, only a modest reduction in tissue fibrosis was monitored between pre- and post-LVAD tissue samples by mechanical unloading [33]. Intriguingly, continuous-flow LVAD support is associated with increased myocardial fibrosis as well as circulating pro-fibrotic markers [36] and might emphasise the need of an earlier LVAD implantation for improvement in advanced HF. As a result of CRT\u2014a therapeutic intervention against the loss of ventricular heart function in DCM patients\u2014upregulation of contractility regulating genes, such as sarcoplasmatic reticulum calcium ATPase 2\u03b1 (ATP2A2), phospholamban (PLN), beta-1-adrenoreceptor (ADRB1), and apelin (APL), was reported [26, 42, 53]. However, these genes were not found to be changed after IA/IgG irrespective of the responder status in our study (see Online Resource ESM 5 Supplemental Fig. S6). Our transcriptome and proteome data indicate differences in ECM remodelling instead of increase in expression or level of contractile proteins after IA/IgG.",

Therefore, at least in theory, the changes in myocardial gene expression and proteome observed in responders may reflect differences in the natural course of disease rather than the effect of therapeutic intervention with IA/IgG. In this context, responders and non-responders display differences in disease duration. Therefore, it may be argued that differences in gene regulation after IA/IgG found in responders and non-responders are related, at least in part, to the significant differences in disease duration with better myocardial recovery in patients exhibiting shorter disease duration. Compared with non-responders, the less advanced disease process in responders is also mirrored by significantly lower LVIDD at baseline. However, we consider it unlikely that the molecular differences observed are primarily attributable to differences in disease stages, because the same molecular differences between responders and non-responders are also seen in patients of both subgroups having similar disease duration (see Online Resource ESM 5 Supplemental Fig. S7). The total number of subjects available for the study as well as for the validation of results by qRT-PCR approach limits the power of the analyses. However, the study is based on paired comparisons of samples of the same patients, which greatly reduces the overall variability. The gene expression and protein analyses data overlap only to minor extent (see Online Resource ESM 5 Supplemental Fig. S8), but the results point to a common result\u2014a difference in the myocardial remodelling and fibrosis. One reason is the lower coverage of the proteome by the LC\u2013MS/MS analysis in comparison with the transcriptome accessible by microarray analyses. Furthermore, it is known that mRNA and protein levels do not essentially correlate, because the latter one depends, e.g. on mRNA stability, translation rate, protein degradation rate, and other factors.",

Improvement of LVEF, LVIDD, and NYHA classes, and inflammation status were accompanied by reduced serum natriuretic peptide levels and lower expression of TGF-\u00df dependent extracellular matrix components and fibrosis markers in responders. A few single molecules clearly show different expression pattern/protein levels in the patient subgroups, e.g. LTPB2, CORIN, periostin, and transgelin, but the importance or even causative role of those molecules in the functional recovery process in responders has to be shown in the future studies. IA/IgG did not normalise DCM-associated expression profiles reported earlier [1, 24]. In contrast to other studies on therapeutic intervention effects in DCM patients [26, 42, 53], normalised neurohormonal activity and beneficial LV remodelling in the responder group were not accompanied by a positive effect on molecules of the Ca2+-handling. A placebo-controlled multicentre study on IA/IgG therapy is still in progress (NCT00558584). Analysis of this data will show if IA/IgG is a potential treatment option for a subset of patients suffering from dilated cardiomyopathy, and material of this patient cohort might be useful to verify the findings of this pilot study.",
