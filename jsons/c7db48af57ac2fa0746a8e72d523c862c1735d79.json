This paper discusses the impact of coronavirus infection on cancer diagnosis and treatment in two leading cancer centres in Pakistan. It also describes the effect that preparations for the expected surge in cases in Pakistan over the next few weeks have had on cancer care. There is an urgent need to evaluate the effect of delays in diagnosis and treatment on cancer stage and treatment, and to decide how to minimise these during likely future cycles of lockdown over the coming months and years.",

Numbers remained low initially, before increasing rapidly as some 3,000 religious pilgrims returned to Pakistan, with many having been infected abroad. The authorities were, and continue to be, heavily criticised for a somewhat chaotic and disjointed initial response, but most of these individuals were quarantined, albeit in sub-optimal conditions. Further increases were seen through March, 2020 as Pakistanis overseas, primarily in heavily infected countries in Europe and in the US, rushed home before travel became impossible or as actual or feared job lay-offs forced them to do so. A recent paper by Bhutta et al [3] suggests that evidence of low-level community spread may have started to emerge by early March, 2020.",

Educational institutions, offices and many businesses have been closed for more than 4 weeks at the time of writing. Today, most of the country has been in a state of partial lockdown for over 2 weeks, but authorities have been reluctant to impose a complete lockdown for fear of the economic havoc this is likely to wreak on a society where up to 25% of workers are daily-wagers. Recent data from India suggests that such fears are probably well-founded [4] . Balancing the risks of COVID-19 against the risks of real economic deprivation, and starvation, is an unenviable task many governments in low-and middle-income countries will face in the weeks and months ahead.",

Economic uncertainty, restrictions on travel and curtailment of 'normal' clinical activity in hospitals as a result of the COVID-19 crisis complicates it further. At SKMCH&RC, Lahore, we have just under 200 inpatient beds and are not, therefore, a large hospital by public-sector standards. It made little sense for us to offer ourselves up as a quarantine centre, or as a 'general' hospital to admit patients with relatively mild disease, since there are several 1,000+ bed hospitals in the city that have greater capacity to offer such services. Instead, we felt we ought to play to our strengths and offer higher-end services that are in short supply in Lahore and in Pakistan generally. One of the key areas which is woefully lacking (all across the world) is ICU beds and ventilators. We, therefore, devised a plan to expand our ICU in Lahore from 11 to 15 ventilated beds, and then, using available resources, to 35 ventilated beds. An inpatient floor, comprising 50 beds, has been converted to an ICU, to allow this expansion. We have offered to provide manpower, supplies and space, by conversion of a second similarly-sized unit, to double this number again, to 70 ventilated beds. This latter expansion is contingent on the provincial government giving us equipment (primarily ventilators and cardiac monitors) to operationalise these beds. In order to do all this, we temporarily suspended intake of new cancer patients-most were unable to travel, in any case-and rapidly curtailed cancer follow-up visits. Booked elective surgery was brought forward, with surgeons being asked to complete as many procedures as possible by the end of March, 2020. Emergency surgery, all chemotherapy and radiation treatment continue, for now.",

Everyone coming to the hospital, and now also all members of staff, undergoes initial screening for symptoms commonly associated with COVID-19 infection, including fever, cough and breathlessness, as they enter the Hospital campus. All those with such symptoms are referred to a temporary triage and assessment centre, which has been established adjacent to, but outside, the main hospital building. Following further assessment here, all those who meet the case definition undergo testing for coronavirus and are either sent home with instructions to self-isolate until their results are available, or are admitted to hospital for further treatment, as needed. This facility is equipped and staffed so as to ensure that all immediate care needed, including testing facilities and plain radiography, up to and including immediate intubation, are constantly available. The triage centre is open 24 hours a day and is now seeing upwards of 150 patients per day although only a small number have needed admission to the hospital, so far.",

This is especially relevant to our large population of cancer patients, whom we are trying our best to protect from this infection. We have created separate entrances to the hospital, and separate routes within the buildings, for cancer patients to access areas they need to be in, such as the chemotherapy bays, cancer inpatient units, and so forth. Learning from the Italian experience, it might theoretically be possible, if the number of patients being admitted rises substantially, to designate hospitals, or parts thereof, as being for patients with definite COVID infection (red) versus for patients suspicious for COVID (yellow) versus for definite non-COVID patients (green), thus allowing clear segregation of patients to occur early on in the course of the disease.",

Pakistan has a very good mobile-phone network, with estimates suggesting that approximately 90% of Pakistanis live within areas that have cell-phone coverage and more than half of all Pakistanis having access to a cell phone. Pakistan has the highest mobile penetration rate in the South Asian region [5] and so we have had over 95% 'attendance' rates, with more than half of these consultations being carried out using WhatsApp video calls. A significant proportion of our patients do not have smartphones, and so we are forced to communicate with them by 'old-fashioned' voice calls, using the mobile network. Nevertheless, the response has been overwhelmingly positive, with many patients expressing relief that they have not been abandoned. Where investigations are needed, these are ordered online and a screenshot (or SMS message) is sent to the patient, with instructions to have these carried out at one of our collection centres. Prescriptions for drugs are sent out in a similar manner, following appropriateness review by clinical pharmacists, but patients are being forced to buy their medication themselves, whereas most would ordinarily have received them for free at the Hospital. Courier services are also currently closed, preventing us from sending medication to patients. There is already disquiet amongst treating clinicians as to whether our indigent patients will be able to purchase their medication in the current climate, not only for financial reasons, but also because of the expected disruption of drug supply chains.",

In some cases, treatments recommended have had to be changed to reflect the current reality of what is possible and available. Thus, a number of patients with hepatocellular cancer considered suitable for ablative therapy or for chemoembolisation have instead been asked to start oral sorafenib, a much more expensive proposition, but one which does not require immediate visits to the hospital. Similarly, those completing neo-adjuvant chemotherapy are having to wait longer than normal for planned surgery, and may need to have additional cycles of chemotherapy to tide them over the increased waiting time. Individual chemotherapy cycles have been spaced out, and radiation treatments are being given in a more compact manner, with fewer fractions, where possible.",

While we would normally perform approximately 800 elective surgical procedures for cancer each month, since the lockdown 2 weeks ago, less than 20 emergent surgical procedures have so far been performed. We are concerned that the number of patients presenting with a need for emergency surgery will increase over the next few weeks.
