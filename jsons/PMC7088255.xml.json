            "text": "Staphylococcus aureus colonizes the nasal mucosa of approximately 30% of individuals. It is associated with a wide range of infections including skin and soft tissue infections (SSTIs, such as bullous impetigo, abscesses, furunculosis, and staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome), systemic or fatal infections [such as blood stream infection (BSI), endocarditis, and pneumonia], and toxin-associated diseases (such as toxic shock syndrome and food poisoning) [1\u20134]. Historically, several classes of drug-resistant S. aureus have emerged [5\u20137]. They include penicillin G-resistant S. aureus, which produced penicillinase (PCase, penicillin-hydrolyzing enzyme) in the mid 1940s, and multidrug-resistant S. aureus (which was resistant to penicillin G, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, and erythromycin) in the late 1950s. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), isolated in 1961, continues to be a life-threatening multidrug-resistant bacterium, changing its resistance patterns by acquiring resistance to each new antimicrobial agent. Such MRSA has been a major cause of nosocomial infections, and thus is alternatively called hospital-acquired MRSA (HA-MRSA). In addition, since the period from 1997 to 1999, another class of MRSA has become a major concern worldwide as an emerging pathogen in the community [8\u201311]. This new class of MRSA is called community-acquired MRSA (CA-MRSA).",

In turn, it can be selected by low levels of antimicrobial agent use in the community [12\u201314]. By contrast, MRSA in hospitals carries some other SCCmec types or exhibits multiple drug resistance, i.e., it imposes a high biological cost. Therefore, it has to be selected by high levels of antimicrobial agent use in hospitals to overcome the biological cost (in turn, transfer to the community is restricted) [12, 15, 16]. Moreover, CA-MRSA must have high colonization and infection abilities to distribute among healthy individuals in the community.",

Generally, ST typing [and analysis of the clonal complex (CC) to which each ST type belongs] is a standard for genotyping (Fig. 1). Typing is based on the seven housekeeping gene sequences, with the allelic profile (allele no. representing the ST type) and CC obtained from the MLST website (http://www.mlst.net/) and eBURST software (http://eburst.mlst.net/), respectively. In contrast, spa typing targets a single gene (spa), and the spa type is given through a public spa type database (http://tools.egenomics.com/) and the Ridom Spa Server (http://spaserver.ridom.de/), but with different assignment (e.g., spa1 for the former and spat008 for the latter). Each ST type clone contains some spa variants. The agr type is determined by PCR; two methods are reported, demonstrating types I\u2013IV. There are subtypes in agrI. Coagulase typing is conducted using an antiserum kit (Denka Seiken, Tokyo, Japan), determining types I\u2013VIII. Attempts have been made for coagulase gene (coa) typing by PCR, but with incomplete results. Coagulase types well correlate with ST types. SCCmec typing is performed by multiplex PCR targeting the mec and ccr (recombinase gene) complexes or targeting even the junk regions, determining types I\u2013VIII. There are subtypes in SCCmecII, III, and IV. Generally speaking, SCCmec I, II, and III are of HA-MRSA, while SCCmecIV and V are of CA-MRSA [9, 12, 15, 16, 29\u201332].\n",

Yet such limited numbers of MRSA clones, emerged, have disseminated worldwide, resulting in the current epidemics in hospital settings [42, 43]. Invasive MRSA epidemics were especially noted in the US and Japan in the late 1970s to early 1990s [5\u20137], when some second-generation cephems (such as cefoxitin and latamoxef) were widely used. These pandemics were followed by MRSA episodes in Europe. Some are still continuing.",

In Hungary, southern Germany (ST228-I) and New York/Japan (ST5) clones have appeared recently, instead of the Hungarian clone (ST239) [47]. In Hong Kong, three major clones, the Hungarian clone (ST239), New York/Japan clone (ST5), and ST45 clone, have appeared recently [58]. The TW clone, a variant of ST239 MRSA, was recently noted as the cause of an outbreak in an intensive care unit (ICU) in London [59, 60]. The association with bacteremia of TW was four times higher than that of other common MRSA clones (such as EMRSA-15 or EMRSA-16). Therefore, it was described as highly transmissible MRSA [59, 60]. ST239 HA-MRSA is a growing MRSA group, which includes at least nine members (EMRSA-1, EMRSA-4, EMRSA-7, EMRSA-11, and the Brazilian, Portuguese, Hungarian, Viennese, and Russian clones), and is widely spreading in Asia, South America, and Eastern Europe [44, 61\u201366].",

These patients complain of a severe pain due to unusually large abscesses. On the other hand, impetigo, the most common SSTI disease, which occurs in superficial skin, is related to PVL-negative CA-MRSA. A study of nasal MRSA carriers (53% positive for USA300) among American soldiers has shown that 29% of nasal MRSA carriers developed SSTI 1 year later. Of the nasal MRSA carriers who developed SSTI, 97% were positive for USA300, indicating that more than 50% of nasal USA300 carriers developed SSTI [98]. This strongly suggests that nasal carriage of MRSA is a risk factor for SSTI; however, the significance of nasal carriage may be varied among the clones. Especially, nasal USA300 carriers may be the high-risk group for SSTI.",

Typical symptoms of CA-MRSA-associated community-acquired pneumonia (MRSA-CAP) include high temperature, arterial hypotension, hemoptysis, rapid aggravation to the point of septic shock, and the need for ventilatory support [105]. In the US, two pediatric fatal cases (ages of 13 years and 12 months) due to necrotizing pneumonia of CA-MRSA (USA400) were reported in 1997 and 1998, respectively [8]. Fatal MRSA-CAP caused by PVL-positive ST30 CA-MRSA in a 1-year-old boy has been reported in Japan [92]. Most importantly, co-infection of influenza patients with CA-MRSA is associated with severe pneumonia with high fatality. In the US during the 2003\u20132004 influenza season, USA300- and USA400- caused pneumonia among patients with seasonal influenza or influenza-like disease (mean age 21 years, range 3 months\u201362 years) showed approximately 30% fatality [94]. In Consensus Guidelines, the American Thoracic Society and Infectious Diseases Society of America emphasized that CA-MRSA pneumonia, as well as SARS and novel influenza, should be paid attention to as life-threatening CAP [95]. In 2009, outbreak of the novel swine origin influenza A (H1N1) occurred worldwide. Fatal co-infection of a 42-year-old sailor with swine origin influenza virus A (H1N1) and PVL-positive ST30 CA-MRSA has already been reported in Hong Kong [106]. Therefore, for all age groups, pneumonia due to co-infection with influenza virus (including novel swine origin influenza virus A) and CA-MRSA should be given serious attention.",

ST59 CA-MRSA from Taiwan carries a unique SCCmec structure (initially designated as SCCmecVII and currently reclassified as SCCmecV) that involves two distinct ccrC genes [32, 137]. In contrast to the initial common understanding that CA-MRSA is generally resistant to only \u03b2-lactam agents, it was multiple drug-resistant to tetracycline, kanamycin, streptomycin, erythromycin, clindamycin, and chloramphenicol. ST59 CA-MRSA carries a PCase plasmid with a tetracycline resistance gene (tetK), composite transposon-bearing streptomycin resistance gene (aadE), kanamycin resistance gene [aph(3\u2032)-III], and erythromycin/clindamycin resistance gene (ermB) [32]. In contrast to many other cases [in which the chloramphenicol resistance gene (cat) is carried by a plasmid], the cat gene in the Taiwanese clone is located in the chromosome. PVL-negative ST59/SCCmecIVx strains with the same multiple drug resistance pattern are present in Taiwanese hospital settings [32]. Recently, a very similar PVL-positive ST59/SCCmecVII strain was found in Japan [138].",

ACME (type I) in USA300 appears to originate in S. epidermidis, a representative skin-colonizing bacterium [12]. ACME contains two operons associated with pathogenesis, arc (encoding for the arginine deaminase pathway), and opp3 (encoding for the oligopeptide permease system) [12, 72]. Arginine deaminase is a virulence factor of Streptococcus\npyogenes, and plays a role in (e.g.) survival at low pH, inhibition of human peripheral blood mononuclear cell proliferation, or invasion [147, 148]. Oligopeptide permease is associated with (e.g.) MRSA growth and infection [149]. ACME is also found in certain strains of ST5 (USA100) and ST59 (USA1000), but such ACME lacks one possible virulence component (the opp3 operon) found in USA300 [12].",

Short sequence repeats (SSRs), consisting of eight amino acids, are located between the Fc binding domain and transmembrane domain and are used for spa typing [18\u201320]. Structures of SSRs could vary the virulence of Spa by changing the distance of the Fc binding domain from the cell surface. It is also known that Spa activates tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 signaling of human airway epithelial cells through the Fc binding domain, resulting in release of IL-8 [164].

            "text": "PVL is considered as an immunoresistant factor due to its cytotoxity against human PMNs and monocytes [195]. Possible association of PVL with necrotizing lesion development has been described. PVL, a member of staphylococcal two-component pore-forming toxins, consists of PVL-S (284 amino acids, 32 kDa) and PVL-F (301 amino acids, 34 kDa) (Fig. 6a) [196\u2013199], which can be purified from bacterial culture supernatants as a monomeric form [173]. Crystal structures of PVL-S and PVL-F water-soluble monomers were reported in 2004 [199] and 1999 [196], respectively. Sequences of those crystal structures were identical to those of the PVL gene core sequence (in ST30 CA-MRSA and others) in Fig. 7 [32, 200, 201]. PVL-S monomer, but not PVL-F monomer, can bind to PMN membrane with high affinity in vitro, indicating that PVL-S mediates receptor binding [202]. PVL-S and PVL-F assemble into the channel complex on cell membrane and induce necrosis of PMNs and monocytes within 30 min (Fig. 6b). Based on studies of PVL and its homologues [196, 203, 204], deduced channel complexes are hexamer-octamer. Amino acid substitutions have been identified by phyrogenetic analysis of the PVL gene (Fig. 7). Some of those are located at the PVL-S surface contacting adjacent PVL-F or membrane and membrane spanning regions of PVL-S (Fig. 6a), and may alter receptor binding of PVL-S or channel formation. Neither PVL-S nor PVL-F alone induces necrosis even at more than ten times higher concentrations (Fig. 6b). PVL also induces apoptosis of PMNs within 4 h (Fig. 6c) through mitochondrial pathway (cytochrome c/caspase-9/3 cascade) [195].\n\n",

Despite its presence in patients\u2019 infected tissue and in vitro cytolytic activity, the role of PVL in necrotizing lesion development is still controversial. Subcutaneous injection of rabbits [205] and nasal injection of murine [163] with purified PVL developed necrotizing lesions, respectively. Nasal injection of murine with PVL-positive S. aureus, but not its PVL-knocked down mutant, also induced necrotizing pneumonia with PMN infiltration, tissue necrosis, and hemorrhage [163]. A synergistic effect of PVL and Spa was proposed. Brown et al. have indicated the importance of PVL in CA-MRSA (USA300)-induced muscle lesions and necrotizing pneumonia in the murine model and protective effects of PVL immunization [206]. These data suggest the role of PVL in lesion development. In contrast, Voyich et al. [207] and Bubeck Wardenburg et al. [208, 209] provided counterevidence. They showed no significant difference in virulence (e.g., abscess volume, lesion size, mortality) between PVL-positive CA-MRSA and its PVL-knocked down mutants in the murine models (skin abscess, dermonecrosis, pneumonia, and bacteremia). Actually, necrotizing fasciitis caused by PVL-negative MRSA has also been reported clinically [210].",

In the S gene, 6 of 11 were non-synonymous substitutions, which change amino acids; all of the amino acid changes occurred in the mature S component. In contrast, in the F gene, of five synonymous substitutions (which do not change amino acids), only one caused amino acid change in the mature F component. The facts that amino acid changes accumulate in the S component and the F component is highly conserved strongly suggest that the S component plays a role in receptor bindings in tissues and the F component plays a role as a toxic component. This result is consistent with a previous notion, obtained by purified component analysis, that the S component acts as a receptor binding, while the F component acts as a toxic component.",

            "text": "The PVL gene is found in various MSSA and MRSA clones. Phylogenetic analysis of the PVL gene is summarized in Fig. 7b [32, 200, 201]. The PVL gene has been identified in 12 ST types. Genes encoding the PVL component with different amino acid sequences are distinguished by different colors. Based on phylogenetic tree analysis, the core sequences could be those of the ST30/ST1335 (single locus variant of ST30)/ST50 group\u2014ST30 includes CA-MRSA and MRSA in the 1980s and 1990s, and ST50 includes CA-MSSA associated with SSTIs; the ST30/ST1335/ST50 group could be an origin of various PVL gene sequences. The same PVL amino acid sequences as those of the ST30/ST1335/ST50 group can be found in ST1, ST22, ST25, ST59, ST80, ST121, and ST1010 (although the gene nucleotide sequences were divergent from those of the ST30/ST1337/ST50 group). However, it should be noted that there existed distinct PVL amino acid sequences in ST30, ST1, and ST8. Distinct PVL amino acid sequences are also found in five other minor cases (Fig. 7b). Based on the previous data of PVL and its homologues [32, 173], and amino acid changes in PVL crystal structures[196\u2013204] and deduced mode of action of PVL are shown in Fig. 7C. In PVL-S, a change at His68 is located at the bottom surface of rim domain (blue, Fig. 7c), suggesting the effect on receptor binding. Of four amino acid changes located in \u03b2-sandwich domain (yellow, Fig. 7c), Val27, His148, and Asn233 are located on the surface contacting adjacent PVL-F. These three, as well as one more change at Phe129 located in pre-stem (membrane spanning) domain (green, Fig. 7c), may alter channel formation. In contrast to PVL-S, Val 11, only one amino acid change in PVL-F, is located at the loop-out region of \u03b2-sandwich domain (Fig. 7c). Therefore, PVL-F is functionally conserved, suggesting that PVL-F may play a critical role in PVL activity in addition to channel formation.",

Since SCCmec is inserted at the attachment site (att), which is located at the right end of orfX, all SCCmec structures contain the att sequence at both ends. SCCmec contains core structures consisting of a mec complex representing methicillin resistance and a ccr complex. The locations of primers used for previous typing are shown in Fig. 9 (arrows). On the other hand, retyping recommended by the committee is determined by the mec complex and ccr complex, located to the right side of the mec complex. In some cases, SCCmec type III is linked to SCCmercury (HG). SCCmec type IVa (of USA300) is linked to ACME. SCCmec types II and III carry the peptide toxin gene (PSM-mec) [180].

ST59 clones showed multidrug resistance (MLSB, tetracycline, or chloramphenicol), indicating similar characteristics to PVL-positive ST59 seen in Taiwan [32]. PVL-negative CA-MRSA isolates were also isolated and showed ST8/SCCmecIVx [262], which has typical characteristics of PVL-negative CA-MRSA in Japan [141]. Recently, after PVL-negative ST88/SCCmecIV CA-MRSA was reported in Japan [250], a similar PVL-negative ST88/SCCmecIVA CA-MRSA has also been isolated in Guangzhou, a city adjacent to Hong Kong [264]. A PVL-negative ST59/SCCmecIVA CA-MRSA was isolated in this study as well.",

In addition, one strain of PVL-positive worldwide CA-MRSA was isolated. Its genotype was ST30/spa19/SCCmecIVc [139]. A multidrug-resistant ST239 clone, described above, has been isolated from outpatients, in addition to inpatients, in Russia, indicating that the multidrug-resistant ST239 clone is spreading even in the community. This may be, in part, because the patients in Russia can obtain antibiotics without doctor\u2019s prescription in the community. Therefore, selection pressure by antibiotics in the community is slightly higher than that in other countries like Japan or the US, suggesting that different criteria for CA-MRSA should be considered. However, further study is needed.",

In addition, human PVL-positive CA-MRSA clones have been isolated from companion animals [274, 276]. Sing et al. [274] have reported a recurrent infection case of PVL-positive ST80 CA-MRSA through intrafamilial transmission among households and cat. To prevent recurrent infections, the eradication of MRSA from companion animals, as well as patients and their households, is important. Other than the ST80 clone, transmission of the USA300 strain from a cat has also been reported [276].\n",

ST398 clones with SCCmecIV or V, as animal-associated CA-MRSA clones, have been widely spreading among livestock [269, 286\u2013290, 292] and companion animals (e.g., horses) [293]. ST398 clones were originally known as non-typeable MRSA in PFGE due to methylation of C-residues in the SmaI recognition site [294]. Currently, transmission of those animal clones to farmers and their households has been noted (Table 3). Furthermore, isolation of the ST398 clone from a patient, family member (carrier), and nurse (carrier) who was taking care of that patient has also been observed, indicating possible transmission from human to human [268]. Those ST398 clones were PVL-negative. However, PVL-positive ST398 CA-MRSA has also been isolated from a human patient with abscesses in China although there had been no description of contact with animals [261].",

They all seem to have been driven by high levels of antimicrobial agent use in hospitals. The concept of MRSA infection has drastically changed since the late 1990s, when CA-MRSA was noted worldwide. CA-MRSA is well adapted to the community and triggers even unexpected cases of diseases for clinicians. Apparently, new countermeasures against the emerging threat (such as active surveillance of CA-MRSA in high risk groups, such as children and their families, and its eradication) must be considered and constructed.",
