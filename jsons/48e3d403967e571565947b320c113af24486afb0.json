CRS is grade 1-2 in the majority of patients but may be severe in 12-47% of patients [37] . CRS typically presents within the first 6 days following CAR-T cell infusion as fever as defining feature followed by hypotension, tachycardia, hypoalbuminemia with capillary leak and weight gain, and consumptive coagulopathy [36, 38] . Immune effector cell associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) with a varied symptom profile may also be observed with later onset: during an episode of CRS or shortly after its resolution [36, [38] [39] [40] . ICANS can also occur in patients who did not develop CRS and this observation in addition to the separate timeline of development has resulted in the separation of ICANS from CRS in the consensus grading system as a distinct toxicity [39, 41, 42] . CRS may also be observed after other tumour-directed immune therapies, including the bi-specific T-cell engager drug, blinatumumab [37] .",

Twelve to 31% of patients admitted to hospital will eventually develop severe hypoxemic respiratory failure and require critical care support [5, 6, 9, 43] . Severe COVID-19 disease, as per WHO-China working group definition, includes the following: respiratory frequency \u226530/minute, blood oxygen saturation \u226493%, PaO2/FiO2 ratio <300, and/or lung infiltrates >50% of the lung field within 24-48 hours [44] . Critical disease is defined as severe COVID-19 with any of the following: respiratory failure, septic shock, and/or multiple J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f organ dysfunction/failure [44] . While multi-organ failure is frequently reported in this population, marked organomegaly has not been reported. One of the emerging facets of severe COVID-19 is the association with a hypercoagulable state. D-dimer elevation was recognised early on in the pandemic to be an important prognostic marker for predicting severe disease and mortality [43] . Klok et al. have reported a 31% incidence of thrombotic complications in COVID patients admitted to the ICU including demonstration of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in 27% of patients [45] . Increased thrombotic risk is seen with many inflammatory states and reflects overlap in the regulation inflammation and thrombosis [46] . The profound activation of thrombotic pathways may be a unique feature to COVID-19 compared to other CSS, but remains to be confirmed in further studies.",

Mouse models of SARS-CoV suggest that delayed type I interferon signaling promotes accumulation of pathogenic inflammatory macrophages leading to hypercytokinemia, vascular leakage, and impaired T cell responses [60] . Deleting the IFN-gamma receptor or depleting macrophages protected mice from lethal infection without affecting viral load, supporting that the inflammatory response may contribute more to severe disease pathology than direct viral effects [60] . In a subset of patients with COVID-19, disease severity seems to correlate with inflammatory markers commonly implicated in other cytokine storm disorders including IL-2R, IL-6, IL-10, and TNF cytokines [7, 8, 10] . In patients with COVID-CSS, development of sepsis, need for intubation, and ARDS, are accompanied by worsening inflammatory markers and are observed between 7-14 days after illness onset consistent with clinical deterioration due to inflammatory sequelae [43] . An autopsy series from 6 patients who died from COVID-19 demonstrated IL-6 production by virus-infected macrophages present in lymph nodes and spleen tissue, suggesting that viral -infection leading to macrophage production of IL-6 was the initial trigger for inflammatory dysregulation [61] .",

Siltuximab, a monoclonal antibody directed against IL-6, in a placebo controlled trial has shown reduction in tumour burden and symptomatic response in a third (34%) of patients with responders having sustained disease control up to 6 years of follow-up [71] . Tocilizumab, a monoclonal antibody directed against the IL-6 receptor, has demonstrated similar improvement in symptoms and biochemical markers of disease activity in a single J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f arm study [72] . Anti-IL-6 therapy is well tolerated for many years in patients with disease response, though relapses may be common following cessation of therapy [32, 72] .",

            "text": "As IL-6 levels correlate with disease severity in hospitalized COVID-19 patients, anti-IL-6 therapy has been one of the first treatment strategies explored during the pandemic [7] [8] [9] [10] . There have been several published case reports, as a well as two larger case series f rom China, using tocilizumab as a treatment for severe COVID-19 demonstrating biochemical efficacy with decrease markers of inflammation, but the impact of clinical outcomes such as time in intensive care and mortality compared to supportive care, remains unknown [74] [75] [76] [77] [78] [79] . A recent large series of 100 consecutive patients with severe COVID-19 demonstrated clinical stability or improvement in 77% of patients following administration of tocilizumab [80] . A press release for CORIMUNO-TOCI (NCT04331808), a multi-centre, open-label randomized controlled trial of tocilizumab in moderate and severe COVID19 has suggested positive results and with the study currently under peer-review [81] . Optimal timing of tocilizumab J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f initiation is unknown, but there is sound rationale that earlier treatment in patients demonstrating a pathologic inflammatory response may ameliorate immune-mediated lung injury. Repeated doses of tocilizumab, similar in strategy to its use in CAR-T cell related CRS, may be reasonable for patients with refractory COVID-CSS. Serious risks of tocilizumab in the short term include a small risk of bowel perforation, acute hepatic failure, and osteonecrosis of the jaw [82, 83] . Case reports of hypertriglyceridemia and candidemia following tocilizumab infusion for COVID-19 have been reported [84, 85] . There is a concern that the use of tocilizumab in COVID-19 could increase the risk of secondary infections and delay viral clearance, as was postulated in the report of 2 cases of viral myocarditis following tociluzumab for COVID-19 [86] . These safety concerns should be thoroughly evaluated in future studies. Clinical trials of tocilizumab, siltuximab, and sarilumab (an IL-6 receptor blocker) are currently being conducted in patients with moderate and severe COVID-19 though trials specifically evaluating these agents in the COVID-CSS population are not yet planned.",

The use of JAK inhibitors is attractive as the medications are well tolerated, have short half-lives, and have the potential to target numerous inflammatory cytokine signaling pathways simultaneously. While ruxolitinib has been the agent most studied in HLH other JAK inhibitors may have potential advantages. Baricitinib, an oral JAK1/2 inhibitor that is currently approved for treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, was recently identified by Artificial intelligence-based technology as a potential immunomodulatory treatment strategy for SARS-CoV-2 [104] . At therapeutic doses baricitinib is predicted to inhibit clathrin-mediated endocytosis and viral entry into cells by blocking the AP2-associated protein kinase 1 (AAK1) [104] . AAK1 regulates endocytosis in numerous cell J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f types expressing ACE2, the receptor that mediates SARS-CoV-2 viral entry, including lung AT2 alveolar epithelial cells [104] . Because any agent that dampens the inflammatory response could lead to a potential loss of immune-mediated viral control, the potential anti-viral effect makes baricitinib an attractive investigational therapy over agents that target disordered inflammation alone. Of concern with baracitinib is the increased risk of thrombosis which may increase the rate of thrombotic complications already observed with COVID-19 [105] . Clinical experience with COVID-19 is limited, but a pilot study of 12 patients has demonstrated improvement in fever, dyspnea, and hypoxia with an lower rate of ICU admission than historical control [106] .

In HLH, data available in pediatric patients demonstrate moderate IL-6 elevation though it has not been useful in distinguishing HLH from sepsis or other inflammatory conditions [112] . Idiopathic MCD is conceptualized as a primarily a disorder of IL-6 elevation, though serum IL-6 levels in iMCD may be normal or only mildly elevated. Response rates to IL-6 blockade do correlate with baseline IL-6 levels in iMCD, but many patients with low IL-6 levels will improve with therapy while patients with high IL-6 levels can show no response [32, 71] . IL-6 levels peak with disease flares in iMCD and can be used to monitor disease course, but once IL-6 blockade is initiated serial monitoring is not useful. Tocilizumab and sarilumab block the receptor for IL-6 leading to clinical improvement while serum IL-6 levels will remain stable or increase [72] . Similarly, IL-6 levels cannot be accurately interpreted for 12-18 months following the last dose of siltuximab. CAR-T CRS demonstrates substantial increases in IL-6 that correlates with severity of CRS and may be orders of magnitude greater the levels reported for iMCD, and HLH [38, 71, 112] . In COVID-19 IL-6 levels have been high for patients with more severe and fatal disease [7, 8, 10, 111] . In our institutions experience with COVID-CSS observed levels of IL-6 have been in the range of ~100-5000 pg/mL (manuscript under review).",
