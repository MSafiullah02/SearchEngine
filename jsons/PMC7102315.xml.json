Dengue is the most important mosquito-borne viral disease affecting humans worldwide. Symptomatic dengue virus infection can present with a wide range of clinical manifestations, from a mild febrile illness to life-threatening shock syndrome [1\u20137]. Scrub typhus is a mite-borne infectious disease caused by Orientia tsutsugamushi. Scrub typhus is an acute febrile disease characterized by a typical primary necrotic lesion (eschar), generalized lymphadenopathy, rash, and non-specific symptoms such as fever, headache, myalgia, and cough. Severe complications include prominent encephalitis, interstitial pneumonia, acute respiratory distress, myocarditis and pericarditis, cardiac arrhythmia, acute renal failure, acute hepatic failure, and acute hearing loss [8\u201313]. For both dengue and scrub typhus, acute respiratory failure (ARF) is a serious complication [14, 15].",

Only a few cohort studies on adult dengue patients and adult scrub typhus patients complicated with ARF have been published [14, 15, 21]. Furthermore, no cohort study comparing the clinical differences between adult dengue and scrub typhus patients with ARF has been published. This may have resulted in a lack of wide-spread awareness of ARF in adult dengue and scrub typhus patients. Consequently, clinicians are likely not aware of the potential for ARF when treating adult dengue patients and adult scrub typhus patients. This study provides relatively rare data regarding the clinical differences between the potential for ARF when treating adult dengue patients and adult scrub typhus patients.",

The cardinal features that distinguish DHF from classic dengue are as follows: (1) increased vascular permeability (plasma leakage syndrome); (2) marked thrombocytopenia (<100,000/\u03bcL) associated with a bleeding tendency; and (3) hepatomegaly and/or abnormal liver function [22]. Additionally, plasma leakage syndrome is the most specific and life-threatening feature of DHF [23]. Plasma leakage syndrome and extreme depression of the platelet count associated with bleeding tendency frequently occurs between 3 and 7 days after illness onset [24]. In this study, all 18 adult dengue patients with ARF were intubated between day 2 and day 8 (mean 4.6 \u00b1 2.0 days) after illness onset. This finding is similar to the clinical course regarding plasma leakage syndrome occurring in dengue patients with DHF.",

As previously mentioned, all cases of acute renal failure were observed before ARF occurred in our study.",
