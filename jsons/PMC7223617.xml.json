Data were sampled (sampling frequency 50 Hz), digitized (12 bits), processed, and stored on the computer using software designed in-house for this purpose. Time-averaged (mean) values of pressures were calculated using time integration of waveforms for 5-s intervals. Time-averaged Vs, Vd, and Vm were calculated after spectral filtration to reduce the influence of noise and averaged within 5-s periods. Digital Fourier analysis was used to correlate corresponding values of arterial blood pressure and CBFV. CPPe was then calculated as CPPe = MAP \u00d7 Vd/Vm + 14 [27]. CrCP was determined as the intercept point of a regression line between arterial systolic and diastolic pressures plotted along the x-axis and the systolic (Vs) and Vd flow velocities plotted along the y-axis [28\u201330].

A third patient experienced refractory intracranial hypertension with an ICP of 45 mmHg.

One limitation of TCD use in general is the considerable variation that can be seen between different operators. It would therefore be imperative that all operators at a single institution would have to undergo regular evaluation to ensure minimal variation in technique and results of their TCD examinations. This would help to ensure accurate and interpretable results when repeated examinations are done on a single patient over time by multiple operators. Furthermore, as CPP is highly dynamic and can fluctuate widely within minutes, improved technology that allows for continuous reliable TCD measurement and subsequent real-time non-invasive CPP calculation in children would be required in order to use the technique as anything other than a one-time screening tool.",
