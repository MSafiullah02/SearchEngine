            "text": "The tourism industry is prone to crises as it is highly fragmented and complex with many interdependencies among its sectors. These interdependencies mean that a crisis in a tourism sector will have repercussions in the others. Henderson (2007, p. 8) argued that a transport accident, a hotel fire or a street riot in which tourists will be caught up will impact tourist arrivals in a destination with impacts on accommodation, attraction and transport providers as well as a number of other tourism stakeholders such as tour operators, travel agents and the destination's tourism authorities. Similarly, events that are not directly connected to tourism may have a huge impact on tourism sectors as witnessed in the 1997 Asian financial crisis (De Sausmarez, 2004), the 2001 World Trade Centre terrorist attack (Ito & Lee, 2005), the SARS epidemic (Pine & McKercher, 2004), the Indian Ocean tsunami (Rittichainuwat, 2006). It is noteworthy, however, that most crises do not occur suddenly. Mitroff (1988, p. 18) observed that \u201clong before its actual occurrence, a crisis sends off a repeated and persistent trail of early warning signals\u201d which could be picked up at a time where there is still opportunity to prevent it from occurring or to take measures that will minimise its impact. These early warning or crisis signals are pieces of information indicating deviation from normalcy (e.g., financial indicators exceeding a threshold, abnormal patterns of social behaviour, etc.) that may escalate and lead to a crisis. For example, a receding ocean following an earthquake felt in the coast may be an indication of an approaching tsunami, an unusually increased number of patients with respiratory problems admitted in a hospital may be an indication of an emerging epidemic and an increased number of clashes between religious sects in a destination may indicate possible political unrest. Early detection of these signals and timely response to them might have saved a good part of the 230,000 lives claimed by the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, of the 41% of tourism GDP that Hong Kong has lost due to SARS in 2003 or of the more than $600 million Bahrain has lost due to the cancellation of the Formula 1 Grand Prix in 2011.",

Small changes in the parameters of a crisis may ultimately cause enormous changes in its outcome as minute initial differences are magnified and transformed by the dynamical processes at work (\u201cbutterfly effect\u201d, Lorenz, 1993) rendering the crisis extremely sensitive to the initial conditions of its evolution (Paraskevas, 2006). This sensitivity underlines the importance of early interventions in crisis development and, therefore, of processes able to capture the crisis dynamism through the detection, transmission and interpretation of the signals it emanates. With this thinking, Mitroff (1988) proposed a five phase (\u201cfive mechanisms\u201d \u2013 in his terms) crisis management model: signal detection; preparation/prevention; containment (damage limitation); recovery; and learning. This model pre-supposes a signal detection mechanism for better crisis preparedness and even prevention of a crisis.",

These studies have contributed a lot in evaluating the impact of crises on tourism (e.g., Blake & Sinclair, 2003; Eugenio-Martin, Sinclair, & Yeoman, 2005; Pizam & Fleischer, 2002), addressing particular aspects of crisis management, mainly destination recovery (e.g., Beirman, 2003; Israeli & Reichel, 2003; Prideaux, 2004) or focussing on lessons learned from crises (e.g., De Sausmarez, 2004; Henderson, 2003a, Henderson, 2003b; Miller & Ritchie, 2003). However none of them has looked at crisis signals and what Mitroff (1988) calls \u201ccrisis detection mechanism\u201d. Even the few studies that propose more strategic approaches to tourism crisis/disaster management (Faulkner, 2001; Ritchie, 2004) just touch upon crisis signal detection. Key research questions such as how should a signal detection mechanism be designed, what types of detectors it should use and for what signals it should look and where, largely remain with no answer.",

A study with significant contribution in understanding the impact of terrorism in tourism was undertaken by Pizam and Smith (2000) who did a comprehensive analysis of terrorism events around the world during the period between 1985 and 1998. These researchers described the crisis events in detail offering authors' analyses and participants' insights about the crises under investigation as well as evaluation of its impacts on the economies of different destinations leading them to suggestions about the need for post-crisis response and actions to minimise the impacts of crises on tourism organizations and destinations.",

Researchers in this stream also identified the importance of the development of crisis management teams, disaster management plan testing, employee training for crises and the protection of guests from disasters (Brewton, 1987; Burby & Wagner, 1996; Drabek, 1995) at the post-crisis stage. Significant contributions were made by these researchers who studied the damage limitation practices of tourism organizations. This stream is taking a more reactive approach to crisis management thus completely ignoring the possibility of crisis signals and their detection.",

            "text": "The third stream of crisis management research highlights the importance of pre-crisis stage and argues that both hospitality organizations and tourist destinations need to understand the causes and consequences of previous crises in order to plan and prepare themselves for the future ones. The main focus of researchers in this stream has been the phenomenon of global terrorism (Cushnahan, 2004; Stafford, Yu, & Armoo, 2002; Taylor & Enz, 2002; etc.) as well as the two great epidemics (Foot and Mouth Disease and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) which affected tourism not only in the UK, Southeast Asia and Canada but globally (Coles, 2003; Henderson, 2004; Kim, Chun, & Lee, 2005; McKercher & Chon, 2004; Ritchie, Dorell, Miller, & Miller, 2004; Sharpley & Craven, 2001; etc.). Natural disasters ranging from hurricanes in the US (Chandler, 2004) to wildfires and floods in Australia (Armstrong, 2005; Armstrong & Ritchie, 2005; Faulkner & Vikulov, 2001) and to the devastating Indian Ocean Tsunami (Carlsen, 2006; Henderson, 2005; Rittichainuwat, 2006; etc.) have also been investigated. The study of these crises was aiming mainly at evaluating the industry's response and at identifying best practice to be used in similar situations in the future (Armstrong, 2005; Henderson, 2003a, Henderson, 2003b; Henderson, 2004; Johnson-Tew, Lu, Tolomiczenko, & Gellatly, 2008). Scholars in this stream maintain that learning from the previous crises is crucial for the management of a crisis. Although this stream sets a good foundation in understanding the importance of preparedness by learning from the previous crises as well as potentially best practice in crisis response, the relevant studies do not propose a holistic crisis management strategy or a framework capturing the different \u201cmechanisms\u201d of crisis management, thus leaving signal detection largely out of their discussion.",

Drawing on insights from the broader disaster management literature, Faulkner (2001) produced a generic model for analysing and developing tourism disaster management strategies. Prideaux (2004), evaluated Australia's response to tourism disasters in 2001, using Faulkner's (2001) framework and concluded that response would be far more effective should the government adopt such a framework, whereas Miller and Ritchie (2003) applied the model on the outbreak of Foot and Mouth Disease in UK and found that, due to the nature of the disaster, it would serve only as an analytical tool rather than a preventative tool for tourism organizations. Following this study Ritchie (2004) proposed a more \u2018holistic\u2019 strategic approach to crisis management which starts with proactive pre-crisis planning, goes through strategy implementation and ends with evaluation and feedback. These frameworks have set a solid foundation based on which other researchers attempted to built their own disaster management models such as the one proposed by Hystad and Keller (2008) which draws from both these frameworks and the researchers experience from the Kelowna forest fires or the one proposed by Paraskevas and Arendell (2007) which aims at mitigating terrorist attacks to a destination. The models proposed in this stream touch broadly upon the concept of crisis signal detection and some make reference to early warning systems, however, they do not provide answers to key questions such as how these detection systems should be designed, where the scanning for crisis signals should take place, what types of detectors they should use and how the captured signals should be transmitted to the decision making centres. The following section draws upon the signal detection literature in order to conceptualise these questions.",

            "text": "Environmental scanning is employed by organizations to make sense of the environment in which they operate and is a function strongly supported by business strategy authors, despite potential challenges and deterrents that a formal approach to it may present (Huffman, 2004; Okumus, 2004). Lozada and Calantone (1996) suggest that the scanning could be both structured and unstructured (spontaneous) by combining ad hoc external networks with a more formal system for information collection. Huffman (2004, pp. 47\u201348) extends this suggestion by asking for \u201ccollective intuitions to synthesize a picture of future threats\u201d, \u201cmore power \u2026 to lower level managers who are the first ones to see the writing on the wall\u201d and a need for organizations \u201cto reduce their vulnerability\u201d. Considering that the scanning effort may be both structured and unstructured (Lozada & Calantone, 1996) or passive and active (Farh, Hoffman, & Hegarty, 1984), it is useful to evaluate the organization's environment that should be scanned. The largest part of the business strategy literature (e.g., Aguilar, 1967; Fahey & King, 1977; etc.) divides these environments into internal (consisting of the organization's structure, culture, and resource variables), task (which includes industry force variables) and general or societal (which comprises economic, technological, socio-cultural, and political-legal variables affecting the organization). A relatively different, and perhaps more useful for the present study, perspective on the exploration of the information environment is proposed by Alberts, Gartska, Hayes, and Signori (2001) in their research on information warfare operations who suggest a division in 3 domains: physical, informational and cognitive. In an organizational context, the physical domain encompasses the entire environment, and the organization intends to influence directly or indirectly, e.g., safe production processes and customer service, sound fiscal operations, employee training and development, competitive environment (with all its components), suppliers, and customers. The information domain contains all elements required for the creation, exploration and dissemination of information as well as its transformation to explicit/tacit knowledge. Within this domain all environmental scanning outputs are gathered through scanning activities undertaken by various detectors within and outside the organization and may have a variety of forms and different degrees of sensitivity (e.g., data from a direct organization/customer encounter, market analyses, situation reports, regional/national per capita consumer expenditure, competitive intelligence). The cognitive domain is the place where \u201cperceptions, awareness, understanding, beliefs, and values reside and where, as a result of sense-making, decisions are made\u201d (Alberts et al., 2001, p. 13). von Lubitz and Wickramasinghe (2006) include in this domain human factors that affect operations, such as education, experience, political inclinations, social attributes (behaviours and peer interactions), commitment, loyalty, open mindedness and intuition of organizational members involved in the relevant activities.",

Technical detectors can be devices or machines that monitor critical for the organization functions or data received by its internal or external environment and are able to identify changes in them. Human detectors can be members of the organization or people external to the organization that have access to data pertinent to its functions and are willing to transmit these data to the organization's decision making centres. They may be people specifically assigned to signal detection even if this may not be their full-time occupation (Regester & Ladkin, 1997). Although Cobb (2003, p. 81) suggested that as much as 80% of information needed by the organization already exists inside it, an effective signal detection system should include a wide network of external detectors. It is important, at this point, to make the distinction between external detectors who are members of the organization detecting signals in the external environment and those who are independent from the organization. Several authors (Choo, 1998, 2002; Gilad, 2004) warn that organizational culture, perspective, conventional wisdom, and implicit assumptions within the organization usually hamper the ability of the former to detect the full range of signals available in the environment, whereas external independent detectors are able to detect and capture trends or discontinuities way before these manifest themselves clearly in data available to everyone.",

There are two broad categories for signal capture methods: case definition methods and pattern recognition methods. Case definition methods use previous experiences to define an \u201cevent of interest\u201d and thus track those signals considered of greatest importance (Aamodt & Plaza, 1994; Langseth, Aamodt, & Winnem, 1999). Scanning for signals based on the organization's risk assessment and vulnerability analysis would fall into this category. On the other hand, pattern recognition methods (Schalkoff, 1991) would be extremely useful in identifying signals (or sets of signals) that deviate from the expected baseline (routine) and often result in unknown or unimaginable crises. The possible outcomes of the detector's signal evaluation may be one of the following:1.The detector captures and registers as valid a signal from an emerging threat (true alarm \u2013 hit)2.The detector captures and rejects as noise (or non-signal) a signal from an emerging threat (missed alarm \u2013 type II error)3.The detector captures and rejects as noise (or non-signal) a signal which is noise4.The detector captures and registers as valid a signal which is noise (false alarm \u2013 type I error)\n",

            "text": "An \u2018optimal\u2019 detection performance would mean a maximum rate of hits with a minimum rate of false alarms. According to Swets (1988), the diagnostic accuracy depends on its sensitivity and on the signal specificity. Swets argues that improvement in sensitivity usually occurs at the loss of signal specificity, in other words the number of false alarms (type I errors) may increase significantly. Consequently, for any type of threat a signal detection system can either minimise the missed alarms or minimise the false alarms but never both. The optimal level of sensitivity relative to specificity depends on the consequences of false and missed alarms and they are almost never symmetrical (Puranam, Powell, & Singh, 2006). These consequences are not fundamental properties of the detection process itself but are specific to the threats for which the detection is undertaken. For example, The Economist (2000, pp. 91 93) states \u201c\u2026 it costs some $450,000 to prepare a kilometre of coastline for a coming storm\u2026\u201d. An alarm that initiates highly disruptive action (e.g., closure of business, evacuation of premises, transfer to back-up facilities, etc.) may be perceived as having high economic and emotional cost. If this cost is prohibitive, the organization may weigh heavily the probability of false alarms when setting the sensitivity threshold. Other scholars too debate against a high sensitivity threshold, in that it may cause the \u2018cry-wolf phenomenon\u2019 (adapted from Aesop's fable) or \u2018false alarm effect\u2019. Breznitz (1984), for example, talks about \u201cthe credibility loss [of a crisis signal detection system] due to a false alarm\u201d (p. 11). Crisis and disaster management theorists, however, argue that in real life situations public response to an alarm is not diminished, if the basis of a false alarm is understood (Dow & Cutter, 1998; Drabek, 1994).",

The dynamics of signal transmission between organisational members can be explained by the social exchange theory. In Social Exchange Theory, which has been successfully applied to social psychology, it is argued that relationships providing more rewards than costs lead to mutual trust (Emerson, 1981). Exchange relationships that are based on reciprocity and mutual attraction (Granovetter, 1985) enhance the knowledge flow leading to more effective organisational functioning (Tsai & Ghoshal, 1998). In particular, social relationships and exchange between the members of organizations stimulate creative ideas and new knowledge (Clercq, Dimov, & Thongpapanl, 2010) and such knowledge in turn can increase an organisation's ability to respond to the changes in a dynamic and hostile environment (Kim, 1998; Kim & Mauborgne, 1998).",

The latter criterion is exactly what Patton (2002) means by \u2018criterion of importance\u2019. Access was gained to a population that met the three first criteria, through the Global Council on Safety, Security and Crisis Management of the International Hotel and Restaurant Association (IH&RA) in 2006. The Global Council at the time consisted of corporate level executives specialised in the area of crisis and risk management (indicative titles: Senior Director Crisis Management & Business Continuity; Vice President Risk Management; Vice President Corporate Safety and Security; Director Corporate Security; Director of Safety and Security; Chief Security Officer) and CEOs of smaller national and international hotel chains.

This process, also known as \u2018member checking\u2019, adds both internal (authenticity check) and external validity (transferability) to the overall study (Lincoln & Guba, 1985). The verified interview transcripts were coded and analysed using N-Vivo 7 which enabled us to identify themes and categories and to organise the responses according to these. In order to ensure the reliability of the analysis, we followed the accepted practice of employing third parties to perform the same analysis independently (Paraskevas, 2001). Two academics in risk management were engaged with the task to read, sort and classify the interview findings. The resulting classifications did not show significant differences from the one produced by us. To further ensure reliability with a test\u2013retest reliability check, the two analysts were invited to perform the same task for a second time, eight weeks later. The two analyses resulted in a 96 per cent agreement which is considerable higher than the prescribed level of acceptance for exploratory research, which is \u201cin the order of 0.6\u201d (Paraskevas, 2001).",

            "text": "In this study, we aimed at the recall of the \u2018one\u2019 crisis that was so significant (shaping their view of crisis management) for the participants, that they had to think it over and over again many times in their lives with all its details. Table 1 shows that these critical incidents cover a wide range of events with a reasonable degree of overlap or similarities (9/11, hurricanes, etc.). In almost all cases (except 9/11 and the car bombing) the participants admitted that there were adequate warning signals prior to the crisis which were either ignored or misinterpreted. In order to justify their claim, the participants were probed to offer details about these signals and in all cases they did (statistics, metrics, reports, etc.). However, in spite of their admission of warning signals, they did not all categorically label their crisis as \u201cpredictable\u201d but used expressions such as \u201ccould possibly be predicted\u201d, \u201cthere were some signs that might have led us to a prediction\u201d, etc. (Participants B and G). The ability to make meaningful use of these signals depends on individuals (arrogance, fatalistic approach to life, denial of crisis or mere inability to understand the threat) but, according to most participants, predominantly on the culture of the organization. They have all emphasised the need for a crisis signal detection culture as part of an organization-wide crisis culture that should be embedded at all levels of the organization and by which everyone who notices an abnormality is responsible to report it to a decision making centre. Such culture distinguishes a \u2018crisis averse\u2019 from a \u2018crisis prone\u2019 organization. Having said that, they all agreed also in that not every crisis is predictable or emits warning signals. Participant B stated that a pre-condition for effective detection and response to an emerging crisis is the in-depth understanding of threats and risks the organization is facing. This, according to B \u201cis the cornerstone of our crisis management actions; we know that we cannot be possibly prepared for everything but our aim is to be able to limit the damage from the unthinkable\u201d. Such understanding, however, is not always possible, due to the complexity of certain crises (as in the case of Katrina \u2013 Participants I and K) or because the organizations involved are unable to capture the full scale of cause and effect (Participants B and K used the term \u201ccrisis puzzles\u201d) as the effect may be the result of multiple causes or one cause may have multiple effects. Participant B stressed the need of a wide range of detectors paralleling signal detection with a radio: \u201cif you are tuned to only one frequency, you will catch the signals broadcasted only in that frequency\u201d. Pointing out that they had all the crisis signals for a hurricane and they were prepared for it, Participant K stated that they could never expect a \u201cpackage of three crises in one: hurricane, flood and social unrest\u201d. In other cases (e.g., 9/11) crises may simply be unthinkable (all participants used this term during the interviews). Several participants (A, B, J, L, M, P) also noted that some crises may be known for quite some time and emit clear signals but as they continuously evolve together (co-evolve) with the prevention/mitigation measures in a form of \u201carms race\u201d (e.g., terrorism, cybercrime, etc.), their final form and impact cannot be easily predicted. Participant F made the point that signals may be there but are not always specific. She further argued that in most cases where crisis signals exist, they point towards a \u201crange of possible courses\u201d that a crisis may take.",

The participants used terms such as \u201cstructured\u201d, \u201cplanned\u201d, \u201ctargeted\u201d and \u201crobust\u201d to differentiate this type of signal detection process from the passive, ad hoc capture of crisis signals from random sources. A good part of the participants (A, B, C, D, G, H, N and P) related this condition with formal risk assessment and business impact analysis practices and emphasised the development of specific indicators for emerging threats.

Other detectors that could be part of the core signal detection network might be non-specialist detectors not directly employed by the organization such as regular suppliers, key customers, government agencies (non-specialist because their primary function is not the one of signal detection) and specialist detectors such as vendors of intelligence services (business intelligence, internet scanning, press clipping and media monitoring services, etc.) formally employed by the organization. A second part of the organization's signal detection network is a set of short-lived random networks that can provide useful information and warning signals when a situation arises. Normally, these networks are formed \u2018ad hoc\u2019 by customers (participants A, D, F, G, O), competitors (participants B, D, E, F, N) or vendors specialised in crisis-specific services (participants D, E, I, J, O) such as security, disaster recovery, business continuity, crisis counselling, etc. and last only for a short period of time when an issue is evolving into a crisis.

Participant F suggested that her revenue manager should be able to identify a subtle but unusual spate of cancellations when a viral online rumour got out about racist practices in their hotel chain, way before this escalated into a full blown crisis. Several participants noted that organizations fail to learn from crisis experiences because they do not have established mechanisms needed to formalise, codify and share the lessons learned. Others (A, C, D, G, M) talked about the need for the creation of a crisis knowledge database (some used the term \u2018repository\u2019) which will help both the detectors and the decision makers in the organization to identify similarities with past crises when an abnormality occur. Participant O emphasised that such a database would also offer a \u2018repertoire\u2019 of responses thus enabling a faster reaction of management to a given series of crisis signals. However, although many participants agreed in principle with the idea, they dismissed it from a practical point of view. Participant I argued that \u201csuch a database will be impossible to be created by one organisation; we are not the CIA!\u201d When prompted about a \u2018repertoire\u2019, Participant L was very sceptical saying that it may limit response to more complex crises: \u201cthis matching of information approach will direct us respond according to what this repertoire suggests rather than the crisis we actually experience. When your only tool is a hammer, all problems will look like nails.\u201d Other respondents though suggested that some forms of crisis knowledge databases already exist, mentioning organizations such as FEMA and OSAC who also issue warnings when they capture signals indicating abnormalities in certain geographic locations and gave examples on how they were exploiting this \u2018knowledge\u2019.

However, at the same time the Army Corps of Engineers insisted that they were no levee breaches and FEMA was claiming that they were coping. With several communication gaps due to the hurricane itself the hotels could not really understand what signals were genuine and what not. However, in such situations another challenge with signal capturing is the one described by participant N as \u201cthe cocktail party effect\u201d in which the detector may focus on a particular set of signals, ignoring completely others that may exist. Participant L illustrates this by stating when describing a case of a group food poisoning in a hotel in South East Asia that \u201cthe crisis was not caused because we did not see the warning signs. In this part of the world food hygiene standards are not always the highest possible and we got slack in maintaining a good level in all our kitchens.

Most participants argued that, with the advances in information and communication technology, the transmission of signals should not present many problems even for organizations whose crisis maturity level is quite low.

Strong supporters of \u2018abundant and redundant\u2019 communication platforms were participants C, D and P who gave several examples of the platforms they use, however, it is noteworthy that these are all very large international hotel groups. Participant B stressed the need for availability of multiple connections as, in his experience, \u201c\u2026if you have only a couple of communication lines, signals will be congested and eventually lost\u201d.

Participant J, although agreeing in principle with the concept, dismissed the idea unfeasible for his organization stating that the cost of decision support technology or expert groups required went beyond their crisis management budget. This view was shared by several participants who argued that the collation and sense-making of the signals is done anyway by the decision makers in the end of the signal detection network.

This literature offers empirical evidence that people, in hindsight, have the tendency to believe that some events were more predictable than they actually were. Clearly, the distinction between predictable and non-predictable crisis is a difficult task since it largely depends on the availability of an adequate quantity and quality of pre-crisis signals. The participants linked these signals with varying degrees of predictability, confirming the view that crisis events cannot simply be predictable or unpredictable but lie in a continuum of predictability (Tetlock, 2005). However, the participants conceded that it is not the mere existence of these signals that makes a crisis more or less predictable but the ability firstly of the detectors and, most importantly, of the decision makers to interpret these signals and trigger the responsive action.",

Consistent with the work of Scheaffer et al. (1998), participants reported departmental tribalism, silo mentality and cognitive arrogance as factors that hinder signal detection. Gilad (2004) argued that \u201cfunctional silos\u201d (p. 17) are a consequence of organizations failing to integrate their different functional areas. He also posited that quite often organizations create information \u201cfirewalls\u201d (p. 254) within them when some signals detected in the environment are deemed too sensitive to be broadly shared or certain channels for transmission of such signals are cumbersome to use. Bazerman and Chugh (2006) used the term \u201cbounded awareness\u201d that occurs when \u201ccognitive blinders prevent a person from seeing, seeking, using, or sharing highly relevant, easily accessible, and readily perceivable information during the decision-making process\u201d (p. 88). The question of priorities is also equally important. Participant L admission that they had all the warnings but concentrated in the \u201cwrong priorities\u201d reflects a not uncommon perception of some managers that it is preferable to avoid a cost (of responding to a series of warning signals) in the present when the benefits of this action may appear in the longer term or when the reward for responding is uncertain.",

The ideas of leading and lagging indicators as warning signals for known crises are also consistent with the approaches proposed by the traditional crisis and disaster management literature (Berg & Pattillo, 1999; Kaminsky et al., 1998; Sornette, 2004). However, as the participants indicated, in complex situations and in newly emerging crises these signal detection approaches are not adequate. When considering the topic of environmental scanning, most participants admitted that their signal scanning activities are looking for \u2018ground truth\u2019, for \u2018what is out there\u2019 (physical and informational domains) and not \u2018what will possibly be\u2019 in the terms of Alberts et al.

However, the identification and classification of networks in this study departs from the traditional literature which broadly divides the detectors into internal and external, technical and non-technical (human). Focusing the discussion on human detectors, one can notice that, for example, Turner (1976) talks about members and non-members of the organization, Mitroff (2004) talks about internal detectors and gossip networks on the one hand and external communities, special interest groups and industry trade groups on the other and Regester and Larkin (1997) about specially appointed internal detectors. During the interviews it was made clear that the participants did not assume clear boundaries between the organization and its external environment but considered these boundaries as blurred and dynamic. When considering employees, suppliers and customers as detectors one has to accept that they are also part of other special interest groups as well as of the wider community. Their family members and their friends may work for competitors, the government or industry regulators and through their relationship they may be able to scan a different set of signals. Contracted specialist service providers may be considered at the same time as internal and external detectors. In the current study the participants used as criteria their specialism on crisis signal detection and the strength of relationship with the organization (formal/strong, informal/weak).",

Such a database is consistent with Mitroff's (1988) model which includes a learning mechanism as well as with other models proposed by crisis management scholars such as Heath (1995) and Gonzales-Herrero and Pratt (1998). The idea of a continuously evolving point of reference for detectors (and decision makers) to facilitate the recognition of signal patterns or even enable them define a case as an emerging crisis was further elaborated by Mitroff (2004) who suggested that organizations need \u201cworld-class Crisis Learning Centers\u201d (p. 20) to study patterns associated with past crises (own and others'), distil critical lessons from them and ensure that these will shape the organization's crisis planning in order to reduce the potential for future crises. Clearly, however, the cost implications of such an endeavour make it rather a desirable \u2018add-on\u2019 rather than an essential element for the signal detection system. The proposition of an industry-level (or UNWTO-level) knowledge database appears to be more realistic; however, there are still important practicalities to be taken into consideration, such as the difficulties in the codification and storage of complex multi-dimensional crisis information (e.g., the 2004 hurricane Katrina or the 2011 Tohoku earthquake) or the possible bias in terms of responsive action that the information retrieval system may cause as a result of this codification (not every crisis is the same crisis). In any case, normally knowledge is local, so that any single detector or manager cannot have knowledge of the entire organization and its universe as a whole. Experts will notice signals that non-experts will not, people working inside the organization will notice things that externals will not and vice versa. In that way, local knowledge added piece by piece can fill in for the holistic knowledge a database can provide.",

Seeger, Sellnow, and Ulmer (2003, p. 68) called this type of signal bracketing \u201cselective attention\u201d and related it with the detector's background, history, previous commitments, capacity, ease, or with the prominence of some signals. And second, the need for crisis signal fusion (collation) as the first step towards sense-making and consequently decision making about crisis response. Normally when the integrated information reaches the response centre, it is compared with a repertoire of existing crisis experiences and knowledge thus validating (or not) the potential threat. The proposed fusion hubs should have or develop the competence to sense complete patterns where signals are ambiguous and data incomplete through a constant reconfiguration of mental models using \u2018bricolage\u2019, scenario planning and mindfulness in order for them to reach a state of a \u2018collective mind\u2019 (Weick & Roberts, 1993). Once such level of competence is achieved, the crisis response team will be able to consciously respond to crisis signals based more on their shared sense of purpose and less on their \u2018repertoire\u2019 of responses.",

However, the extant research has not yet explored in depth the significant component of crisis management called crisis signal detection. Using basic concepts and ideas from Signal Detection Theory and the generic crisis management literature, we developed a conceptual framework for a three-stage process of crisis signals detection consisting of signal scanning, signal capture and signal transmission to the crisis response centre.

Hubs may perhaps offer the benefit of filtering signals from noise and collating them in a way that may facilitate the decision makers to make sense of them, however, this is done at the expense of a timely response and it may cause the loss of important signals in the process. Therefore, the emphasis should be put more in the availability of communication platforms for the detectors to transmit the captured signals to the decision makers rather than on complex, sophisticated (and expensive) \u2018fusion hubs\u2019 and filtering mechanisms. Ultimately, the successful signal detection depends more on the \u2018collective mind\u2019 and the shared sense of purpose within the organisation rather than on predetermined repertoires and databases. Consistent with the social exchange theory principles discussed earlier in the paper, the first and most basic stage of crisis signal detection may simply be the sharing of time sensitive information and existing knowledge in an opportune fashion (for example the DHS's \u201cSee Something - Say Something\u201d campaign for terrorism). However, social exchange theory alone cannot capture the complexity of signal detection since, at more advanced levels of maturity, signal detection and the \u2018collective mind\u2019 move from the opportune transmission of \u2018what is\u2019 to identifying \u2018what could possibly be\u2019 and where the signals of known and unknown crises could be captured.",

            "text": "These findings have particular significance to tourism organisations since, due to their high interconnectivity with all aspects of society (political, economic, social, technological and environmental), they are more vulnerable to crises and are affected by every possible disruption from normalcy whether this is political or civil unrest, a natural catastrophe, economic recession, etc. Therefore, these findings may help practitioners who embark in the design of crisis management mechanisms in creating a basic framework of actors and conditions for the effective detection of crisis signal in their organization. The findings will help them identify detectors they can employ, scanning approaches, scanning domains and issues to be taken into consideration in the three stages of the detection process. For academic researchers, apart from the deeper exploration of three stages of the crisis signal detection, this study opens a wide range of areas for further investigation. For example, of great interest would be to investigate how the \u2018crisis culture\u2019 to which the participants in this study so often referred to can be developed and embedded throughout an organization. Another interesting area for research would be to investigate how a detection network can be populated and maintained, what strategies could be used for detector recruitment and engagement in both core and \u2018ad hoc\u2019 networks and how can these detectors could be maintained active and productive. Moreover, the scanning methodologies and approaches in the three organizational domains (physical, informational and cognitive) will differ significantly and this is an area that offers a wide scope for further research. One obvious direction for research would be to examine the efficacy of these methodologies in case studies of actual crises. The issue of crisis knowledge management appears to be another interesting avenue of research with significant implications in the design and exploitation of a signal detection system. Also, this study is based only on insights and views of corporate executives. Practitioners at other levels of the organization, i.e., regional VPs, area managers, hotel general managers and chief security officers may not completely share these views and may offer different insights on crisis signal detection in general or in particular aspects of it such as detection network, reliability of \u2018ad hoc\u2019 detectors, attributes of \u2018core\u2019 detectors, etc. Finally, it is worth pointing out that early interventions may prevent a crisis but may also merely change its course and, as a dynamic phenomenon, evolve in a different form of crisis. Further interventions may cause further evolution of the crisis and this process of co-evolution offers scope for the exploration of all crisis management components through the lens of chaos and complexity theories.",
