These viruses can infect the respiratory, gastrointestinal, hepatic, and central nervous system of humans, livestock, birds, bat, mouse, and many other wild animals (Wang et al. 2006; Ge et al. 2013; Chen et al. 2020a, b). It first emerged in southern China in late 2002 and due to its fast transmission rate among humans, it immediately led to a global pandemic in 2003. More recently it has created havoc around the globe from December 2019 onwards, spreading over 100 countries and affecting thousands of people (Remuzzi and Remuzzi 2020). For this reason, it has been considered as a major public health threat in the twenty-first century (Zhong et al. 2003; Cui et al. 2019).",

The administrative and scientific communities of China still are working towards the etiology, prevention and control, and drug development for the epidemic. On January 12th, 2020, the World Health Organization provisionally named the new virus as 2019 novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) that later on renamed as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2 (Gorbalenya et al. 2020). The continuous evolution and transformation of CoVs lead to sudden outbreaks to the different parts of the world suggesting that it may pose a serious global health hazard in a very short period. In today\u2019s changing climate and ecological balance, and the human-animal interactions, there is an increased risk of CoV disease outbreaks. This makes an utter requirement to focus on efficient measures to fight against CoVs.",

As for now, several proofs indicate that CoV transmission occurs via \u201czoonotic spillover,\u201d a term indicating the transmission of a pathogen from a vertebrate animal to a human host. Although the mechanism of such transmission is not very clear and therefore it is a matter of concern, certain factors determine zoonotic spillovers such as behavioral characteristics of CoV and the susceptibility of a human host (Plowright et al. 2017).",

Since the last few decades, CoV has evolved to adapt to bind the receptors to enter inside the host\u2019s cells through its surface glycoproteins.

The murine coronavirus strain JHM (MHV-JHM or MHV4) that codes for an extremely fusogenic spike protein may accomplish the infection via cell-to-cell spread mechanisms by giving up the known receptor-dependent entry route (Gallagher et al. 1992, 1993). In another study, MHV-JHM was found to infect CEACAM\u2212/\u2212 (carcinoembryonic antigen-cell adhesion molecule) mice severely, a phenotype that was mapped specifically to the JHM strain spike protein (Miura et al. 2008). Based on these results, it can be assumed that there is an existence of a receptor-switching mechanism in CoVs leading to spike modularity and its tendency for recombination. Another speculation can be derived here about the higher fusogenic potential of the spike protein that minimizes its dependency on receptor-based cell entry (Nakagaki and Taguchi 2005; Graham and Baric 2010). The SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 may have followed one of these mechanisms as depicted in Fig. 4.2.\n",

Based on these studies it was understood that bats may have played a natural host for SARS-CoV while civets acted only as an intermediate. One more study exposed the coexistence of varied SARSr-CoVs in bat populations inhabiting one cave of Yunnan province, China, that was also the first information regarding human ACE2 (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) as a receptor for bat SARS-like coronavirus (Ge et al. 2013; Hu et al. 2017). Further, it has already been known that the coronavirus genome frequently undergoes recombination (Lai and Cavanagh 1997), suggesting the high possibility of the emergence of new SARS-CoV through recombination of bat SARS-CoVs existing in same or another bat caves. Cui et al. (2019) speculated the production of SARS-CoV direct progenitor via recombination within bats, and thereafter it passed on to the farmed civets and other mammals leading to virus infection to civets by fecal-oral transmission. These virus-contained civets transported to the Guangdong market where they infected market civets and further mutated before affecting humans.",

Such phenomena may be responsible for the series of recombination within the S gene and around ORF8 leading to the origin of SARS-CoV direct progenitor.

The probability of animal-to-human transmission is ruled by various factors such as the dynamics of disease in an animal host, level of virus exposure, and the susceptibility of human population. All these factors can be summarized into three major stages that depict the way of virus transmission. The primary stage defines the pathogen pressure on human host, i.e., the amount of virus interacting with humans at a particular instant regulated by virus prevalence and dispersal from the animal host, followed by its survival, development, and distribution outside the animal host. In the next stage, the behavior of humans and vector defines the chances of viral exposure, the route of entry, and the dose of the virus. The last stage is influenced by genetics, the physiological and immunological status of the human host along with stage two factors determining the possibility and severity of infection (Plowright et al. 2017). The aforementioned stages create a barrier for transmission of the virus to the next level, and spillover necessitates the virus to surpass all barriers to establish an infection in the upcoming host.",
