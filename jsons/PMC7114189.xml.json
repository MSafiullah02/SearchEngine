For example, influenza A virus infects up to 20% of the U.S. population each year, causing approximately 36,000 deaths (http://www.cdc.gov/flu/keyfacts), and poses the continuing threat of a global pandemic that could kill millions (Johnson and Mueller, 2002). Dengue virus is endemic to tropical regions around the world and is reported to infect 80 million people each year, causing 500,000 cases of dengue hemorrhagic fever (Halstead, 2007). Newly emerging RNA viruses also endanger public health as evidenced by the 2002\u20132003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), caused by a novel coronavirus, that claimed the lives of over 800 people after spreading to more than 30 countries (Drosten et al., 2003, Peiris et al., 2003, Satija and Lal, 2007).",

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) classify a number of RNA viruses, including Ebola, Marburg, Lassa and Machupo viruses, as Category A bioterrorism agents. High mortality rates, ease of production, potential dissemination by aerosol and lack of effective countermeasures characterize these pathogens. For example, although not a natural mode of human-to-human transmission, filoviruses are highly infectious via the aerosol route (Leffel and Reed, 2004). There are reports investigating the stability of lyophilized Marburg virus, and the ability to aerosolize these samples for lethal infection of non-human primates (Bazhutin et al., 1992, Leffel and Reed, 2004).",

Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) are single-stranded DNA oligonucleotides that inhibit translation or mediate RNase H-dependent degradation of complementary target RNAs. The introduction of small, double-stranded RNA oligonucleotides (siRNAs) mediates the cleavage of target transcripts through activation of the RNA interference pathway. Small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs), expressed from DNA or viral vectors, also enter the RNA interference pathway after being processed into siRNAs. These reagents are being aggressively pursued as therapeutics for a variety of ailments, including viral infections. Viral genomic RNA, or viral mRNA molecules, can be directly targeted with the aim of disrupting viral replication and disease progression. In this regard, there is continuing preclinical success in using nucleic acid-based techniques to treat viral infections in laboratory animals (Bennink and Palmore, 2004, Lee and Rossi, 2004, Lim et al., 2006, Warfield et al., 2006). Here, we review various experimental oligonucleotide-based therapies and describe recent efforts to target RNA viruses (Table 1\n).",

The ASO must be long enough to confer target specificity and to form a DNA/RNA hybrid of sufficient stability. However, as length increases, there is a greater probability the ASO will bind with partial complementarity to a non-target sequence. Typically, specific base-pairing interactions between the ASO and target transcript result in the RNase H-mediated degradation of the target RNA and a subsequent reduction in the protein product of the targeted gene (Fig. 1\n). RNase H activity in mammalian cells is ubiquitous, constitutive, and is thought to normally play a role in DNA replication and transcription (Busen et al., 1977, Busen, 1980, Eder et al., 1993, Turchi et al., 1994). When targeted to ribosomal entry sites in the 5\u2032 untranslated region of mRNA, ASOs with particular chemical modifications (discussed below) can inhibit translation in the absence of mRNA degradation.",

            "text": "Unmodified oligonucleotides are highly unstable in vivo (in circulation and within cells) due to rapid nuclease digestion. Therefore, ASOs are routinely customized with chemical modifications that increase stability and confer other desirable attributes. For example, Fomivirsen (Vitravene\u00ae, ISIS-2922) is an FDA-approved ASO antiviral drug with phosphodiester linkages that are modified by replacing a non-linking oxygen with a sulfur atom (phosphorothioate modification) (Fig. 2\n) (Orr, 2001, Geary et al., 2002). Phosphorothioate-modified ASOs are poor substrates for nucleases and thus show increased stability, increased serum half-life, and greater tissue retention. Although improved in terms of stability, these highly charged oligos have decreased affinity for their target mRNA, are not taken up efficiently by cells, and readily bind to serum and intracellular proteins, which may lead to diminished activity or off-target effects such as triggering of the complement cascade (Stein and Krieg, 1994, Krieg and Stein, 1995). Additional modifications to the 2\u2032 position on the ribose ring have been developed to increase affinity to target mRNA and provide further resistance to degradation (Prakash and Bhat, 2007). Nucleotides with 2\u2032 modifications, such as 2\u2032-O-(2-methoxy)ethyl (2\u2032-MOE), are not substrates for RNase H cleavage when bound to their target RNA (Fig. 2). Therefore, to retain this property, ASOs are often designed with 2\u2032MOE \u201cwings\u201d: five 2\u2032-MOE-modified nucleotides on each side of approximately 10 central nucleotides without 2\u2032 modification.",

For example, high doses of phosphorothioate-modified ASOs can activate the complement cascade, possibly through an interaction with the serum protein factor H (Jason et al., 2004, Chan et al., 2006). In an effort to reduce such unwanted effects, third-generation ASO reagents, phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers (PMOs), have been developed, in which the ribose ring of the nucleotide backbone is replaced with a morpholine ring (Fig. 3\n) (Summerton, 2007). Additionally, negatively charged intersubunit linkages are replaced by uncharged phosphorodiamidate linkages. The presence of an uncharged nucleotide backbone greatly reduces interactions with serum and cellular proteins, which limits off-target toxicities. PMO modifications also confer high stability and solubility, both desirable qualities for use in the clinic. PMOs bind to target mRNA sequences with higher affinity than other ASOs but do not mediate the catalytic degradation of target RNA transcripts via RNase H (Summerton, 1999). Instead, PMOs are typically designed to target ribosome entry sites, the AUG start codon, splice junctions, or sites of critical RNA secondary structure, and thus reduce target protein levels by interfering with translation or mRNA processing (Fig. 1).",

Despite these research efforts, effective compound delivery is still a major hurdle that must be overcome before ASO compounds find broad utility in the clinic. It is perhaps telling that the only ASO drug approved to date by the FDA, Fomivirsen, is administered locally into the confined space of the eye. Furthermore, despite some success of this ASO in the clinic, its use is now limited due to significant side effects (Mercorelli et al., 2007).",

P-PMOs are generally well tolerated by animal recipients, although toxicity can be observed as the dose increases (Amantana et al., 2007, Tilley et al., 2007). The nature of the treatment regimen may affect P-PMO toxicity. For example, Burrer et al. (2007) observed no treatment-associated toxicity when P-PMOs were administered to healthy mice.

The human genome encodes specialized, non-coding transcripts termed microRNAs (miRNAs) that regulate the expression of cellular genes (Bartel, 2004, Ying et al., 2006). The first miRNAs discovered have a role during development in Caenorhabditis elegans (Lee et al., 1993, Reinhart et al., 2000). It is now estimated that 30% of all mammalian protein-coding genes, and diverse cellular processes, are regulated by miRNAs (le Sage and Agami, 2006). Long, polyadenylated primary miRNA transcripts, containing a hairpin structure with sequence homology to the target gene, are first processed in the nucleus to yield a shorter miRNA precursor (pre-miRNA). Pre-miRNAs are then shuttled to the cytoplasm where they are further processed by Dicer to yield mature, short, double stranded miRNAs (Lee et al., 2003). These are loaded into the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) where they guide hybridization to the target mRNA. Binding of an activated RISC complex to a target transcript leads to transcript degradation or inhibition of translation (Sontheimer, 2005).",

Alternatively, small hairpin RNAs (shRNAs) can be expressed from transfected DNA plasmid vectors or from replication-deficient viral vectors (i.e., adenovirus, and lentivirus, among others). siRNAs are loaded directly into the RISC to mediate target hybridization and cleavage (Fig. 1). In contrast, shRNAs are cleaved by DICER before incorporation into the RISC. Sequence-based rules for designing siRNA molecules with optimal activity are becoming increasingly sophisticated and are available to the general research community (Elbashir et al., 2002, Henschel et al., 2004, Pei and Tuschl, 2006, Shah et al., 2007).

Phosphorothioate linkage and 2\u2032-O-methyl sugar modifications protect siRNAs from nuclease digestion and help prevent off-target stimulation of the type I interferon system (Sioud, 2007). In the pursuit of systemic and targeted delivery, siRNAs have been delivered within liposomes or conjugated to antibodies, cholesterol, RNA aptamers, or peptides (de Fougerolles et al., 2007). A recent report demonstrates the feasibility of organ-specific delivery of siRNA when given intravenously (Kumar et al., 2007). The authors utilized the ability of rabies virus glycoprotein G (RVG) to bind acetylcholine receptor on neuronal cells. A peptide from RVG shows neuronal cell specificity, and when conjugated to siRNA, enables delivery into this cell type. Importantly, RVG-siRNA, when administered to mice intravenously, is delivered to the brain, without accumulating in spleen or liver (Kumar et al., 2007). Although a highly successful siRNA delivery method in this animal model, it remains to be studied whether this general approach is safe in humans.",

However, in some cases, this could account for observed treatment-induced toxicity. Grimm et al. (2006) using a total of 49 different shRNAs expressed from an adeno-associated virus vector, achieved high-level shRNA expression in mouse liver after intravenous injection. Forty seven percent of treated mice died within 2 months. Interestingly, morbidity correlated with an observed decrease in liver miRNA levels. The authors demonstrate that high-level shRNA expression can saturate, and interfere with, components of the endogenous miRNA pathway. Specifically, this saturation may involve the protein exportin-5 and occur at the level of miRNA nuclear export. In contrast, systemic administration of siRNAs can achieve gene silencing in the liver without toxicity and without a disruption in liver miRNA processing (John et al., 2007). One obvious explanation is that introduced siRNAs bypass early processing steps of miRNAs and shRNAs, and are loaded directly into the RISC complex. John et al. (2007) demonstrated siRNA-dependent silencing of liver-expressed transcripts, without a decrease in liver miRNA levels or a disruption in liver miRNA target-gene expression. Importantly, positive safety results have been achieved in phase I and II clinical trials for locally delivered siRNAs. These treatments include bevasiranib (Cand5), a siRNA for intravitreal inoculation, which targets vascular endothelial growth factor (Acuity Pharmaceuticals), and ALN-RSV01, an intranasally delivered product that targets the transcript for the nucleocapsid protein of respiratory syncytial virus (Alnylam Pharmaceuticals).",

            "text": "Two preclinical studies have been published investigating PMOs as a treatment for EBOV infection, with both showing efficacy in animal models. PMOs were designed to inhibit translation of EBOV VP35, VP24, and L transcripts (Warfield et al., 2006). All three PMOs showed activity using an in vitro translation assay and reduced viral titer in cell culture. In a similar study, a different VP35-specific PMO also reduced virus yield in cell culture (Enterlein et al., 2006). This PMO targeting VP35 was conjugated to an arginine-rich peptide (P-PMO), or left unconjugated, and tested in a mouse model of EBOV infection. Five hundred micrograms of VP35 PMO or P-PMO was delivered to mice by intraperitoneal injection (i.p.) 24 h and 4 h before EBOV challenge. With this treatment regimen, VP35 PMO protected 75% of the mice from lethal infection, while 100% of the P-PMO-treated mice survived. Similarly, 100% of mice survived when treated with VP35 P-PMO 24 h after EBOV challenge. A more comprehensive investigation of VP35, VP24, and L PMOs utilized three animal models to test for efficacy (Warfield et al., 2006). In mice, VP35 and VP24 unconjugated PMOs provided complete, and near complete, protection, respectively, when delivered by i.p. injection twice before EBOV infection. Importantly, a combination treatment of all three PMOs, given 24 h after EBOV infection, provided complete protection. Surviving mice developed an immune response to EBOV and were protected from subsequent challenge. In guinea pigs, maximum efficacy was seen when the combination treatment was given 96 h postchallenge, compared to treatment with a single PMO given closer to challenge; probably due to differences in pharmacokinetics and bioavailability between treatment regimens. Finally, anti-EBOV PMO treatment was investigated in rhesus macaques (Warfield et al., 2006). Monkeys were administered a single PMO (VP35) or a combination of three PMOs (VP35, VP24 and L) from 2 days before, through 9 days after EBOV challenge by a combination of parenteral routes. No monkeys treated with the single VP35-targeting PMO survived EBOV infection, but two of four monkeys receiving the combination PMO treatment survived lethal EBOV challenge. A third monkey in this treatment group remained aviremic, but succumbed to a secondary bacterial infection.",

SNALP-encapsulated siRNAs against EBOV L gene were efficacious in a guinea pig model of EBOV infection when given daily by i.p. injection, beginning 1 h after challenge. Viremia was not detected in any of the siRNA-treated animals, although two of five siRNA-treated guinea pigs died (compared to five out of five dead control animals).

Although the presence and significance of an endogenous RNAi antiviral response in mammalian cells is still under scrutiny, it has been well established in plants, insects, and nematodes. It is now suggested that EBOV VP35 has RSS activity, as this protein can inhibit shRNA-mediated silencing of luciferase expression in cotransfection assays (Haasnoot et al., 2007). This RNAi inhibition by VP35 could not be attributed to interferon (IFN) antagonism, as this effect was also observed in Vero cells, which have a defective interferon pathway. Additionally, VP35 can functionally complement a mutant HIV-1 Tat protein. HIV-1 Tat exhibits RSS activity that is required for viral replication (Bennasser et al., 2005, Haasnoot et al., 2007). It is tempting to speculate that siRNA or ASO/PMO treatments targeting RSS protein encoding sequences, whether as part of a pool or as individual compounds, will be more efficacious than treatments that do not reduce RSS protein levels. This will likely be an important area of investigation in the near future.",

These areas of the genome form critical secondary structures that are necessary for viral replication (Khromykh et al., 2003). Deas et al. (2005) identified a peptide-conjugated PMO (PPMO) targeting a highly conserved 3\u2032 sequence element that exhibited potent anti-WNV activity in cell culture. In a subsequent report, this PMO was redesigned to achieve perfect complementarity to this sequence element in WNV, JEV, and St. Louis encephalitis virus (SLEV) (Deas et al., 2007). The redesigned oligo was effective against all three viruses in cell culture. PPMO and PMO targeting this 3\u2032 sequence element were then tested in a mouse model of WNV infection. Although mice could tolerate higher doses of the PMO, compared to PPMO, this reagent did not protect virus-infected mice. In contrast, the PPMO, even when given at a more than 10-fold lower dose, increased survival and improved clinical correlates in mice infected with WNV. One can speculate that the conjugated peptide improved cellular uptake of the PMO and in this way improved efficacy.",

Antisense phosphodiester and phosphorothioate oligos can successfully decrease expression of viral proteins PB2 and PA in cell culture (Hatta et al., 1996, Hatta et al., 1997). Phosphorothioate oligos targeting PB2 have also shown efficacy in vivo. Lipid encapsulated ASOs targeting the AUG start codon of PB2, given IV, protected mice from lethal challenge with influenza A/PR/8/34 (Mizuta et al., 1999). This treatment effectively reduced viral RNA levels in mouse lung, decreased viral titers in the lung, and limited damage to lung tissue. More recently, it was reported that 2\u2032-O-methyl-modified ASOs targeting NS1, delivered intranasally, protected chickens from lethal H5N1 infection (Wu et al., 2008). PMOs have also been designed and found to inhibit multiple strains of influenza A virus (Ge et al., 2006). Peptide-conjugated PMOs (P-PMOs) were designed to bind to the AUG start codon region of four genes (PA, PB1, PB2, and NP). Additional P-PMOs were designed to target four terminal regions of the NP gene, which should interrupt viral RNA/RNA interactions required for RNA synthesis. Six of eight P-PMOs successfully inhibited H1N1 production in Vero cells. Based on these results, two P-PMOs were tested for activity against a panel of influenza A subtypes, including the highly pathogenic H5N1. Notably, pretreatment with P-PMOs targeting the start codon of PB1, or the terminal region of NP, effectively inhibited H5N1 growth in MDCK cells. Postinfection protocols also showed some success (Ge et al., 2006).",

In both studies, siRNA or shRNA treatment reduced viral titers in lung tissue. shRNAs against NP and M2 also increased survival in mice infected with influenza A strains H1N1 or H5N1. Another group also has demonstrated that siRNAs targeting PA and NP can reduce influenza A virus production in the lungs of infected mice and increase survival (Tompkins et al., 2004). Combination treatment with PA and NP siRNAs provided 100% protection from lethal challenge. Importantly, this same antiviral activity was seen against multiple strains of influenza A, including H5N1.

A recent report of peptide-mediated, organ-specific delivery of siRNA after systemic administration is an important advance. Such delivery methods have the potential to increase the efficacy of many ASO and siRNA compounds. The development of systemic and postexposure treatment regimens will be critical for the successful and widespread use of these compounds.
