Despite intensive therapy he died on the 13 March after being transferred to Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China.

Also encouraging, said President Blakeney, are the increases in funding for the Magnet, career ladders, geriatric-training grant and facultydevelopment provisions of the act.

Several other candidate vaccines based on different HIV subtypes are being tested by other public and private organizations, mostly in the United States and Europe, but also increasingly in developing countries, where a total of 22 vaccine candidates have been or are being tested including in Brazil, Haiti, Kenya, Peru, Thailand, Trinidad and Tobago, and Uganda. At least one of these candidate vaccines is expected to enter Phase III trials this year in Thailand, with results available four years later. The WHO/UNAIDS HIV Vaccine Initiative was established in 2000 to facilitate the development and evaluation of appropriate HIV vaccines, ensuring that once they are developed they are affordable and available to all people in need. According to UNAIDS and WHO, an estimated 42 million people are living with HIV/AIDS worldwide, of which close to 30 million live in sub-Saharan Africa. An estimated 5 million people were newly infected with the HIV virus in 2002.

The commentator suggests that in addition to being useful in endemic countries, this test will also enhance our preparedness for bioterrorism.'With this test, the rapid and costeffective diagnosis of bubonic and pneumonic plague could easily be achieved by health workers in remote sites', said lead author Suzanne Chanteau from the Pasteur Institute and the Ministry of Health in Madagascar. 'Use of the test could help to reduce mortality (through rapid and efficient treatment of patients), morbidity (by rapid implementation of preventive measures), and insecticide resistance of fleas (through rational use of expensive insecticides).' The diagnostic test, which takes up to 15 minutes, uses monoclonal antibodies to the F1 antigen of Yersinia pestis. While detecting F1 antigen at concentrations as low as 0AE5 ng/mL, this test also detected 41AE66% more infections than did bacteriological methods, and 31% more infections than did ELISA. Sensitivity and specificity were both 100%, positive predictive value was 90AE6%, and negative predictive value was 86AE7%.In an accompanying commentary, David Dennis and May Chu from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Georgia, praise this study for its comprehensive evaluation in health centres in Madagascar where plague is endemic.'It is anticipated that it will soon be available in plague-endemic areas world-wide, providing opportunities for validations under various conditions', they write. ''In addition, the test\u2026is expected to fill an important need in bioterrorism preparedness and response. ",
