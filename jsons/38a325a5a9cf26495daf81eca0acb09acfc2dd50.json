            "text": "Aminopeptidase N (E.C. 3.4.11.2) is a membrane-bound metalloproteinase expressed in many tissues. Although its cytoplasmic portion has only eight amino acids, cross-linking of CD13 by monoclonal antibodies (mAb) has been shown to trigger intracellular signaling. A functional association between CD13 and receptors for immunoglobulin G (Fc\u2425Rs) has been proposed. In this work, we evaluated possible functional interactions between CD13 and Fc\u2425Rs in human peripheral blood monocytes and in U-937 promonocytic cells. Our results show that during Fc\u2425R-mediated phagocytosis, CD13 redistributes to the phagocytic cup and is internalized into the phagosomes. Moreover, modified erythrocytes that interact with the monocytic cell membrane through Fc\u2425RI and CD13 are ingested simultaneously, more efficiently than those that interact through the Fc\u2425RI only. Also, co-cross-linking of CD13 with Fc\u2425RI by specific mAbs increases the level and duration of Syk phosphorylation induced by Fc\u2425RI cross-linking. Finally, Fc\u2425RI and CD13 colocalize in zones of cellular polarization and coredistribute after aggregation of either of them. These results demonstrate that CD13 and Fc\u2425RI can functionally interact on the monocytic cell membrane and suggest that CD13 may act as a signal regulator of Fc\u2425R function.",

Three distinct types of classic Fc\u2425Rs have been described: one with high-affinity for Fc\u2425RI and two low-affinity receptors, Fc\u2425RII and Fc\u2425RIII [1, 2] . Cross-linking of Fc\u2425Rs by IgG-opsonized particles or IgG-containing immunocomplexes triggers an intracellular cascade of biochemical events that leads to a variety of important cellular functions such as phagocytosis, immune regulation, cytolysis, and transcriptional activation of cytokine-encoding genes, which initiate inflammatory responses related to protection against bacterial infection, autoimmunity, and hypersensitivity [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] .",

In the hematopoietic system, CD13 is expressed on stem cells and during most developmental stages of myeloid cells [12] , and for this reason, it is widely used as a marker of myelomonocytic cells in the diagnosis of hematopoietic malignant disorders. Furthermore, CD13 participates in angiogenesis regulation [13] , cellular motility, and dendritic cell (DC)-induced T cell activation [14] . CD13 is also a receptor for human coronavirus 229E and other enteropathogenic coronaviruses [15] and participates in human cytomegalovirus infection [16, 17] . Moreover, the possibility of CD13 being a receptor for the coronavirus responsible for the severe acute respiratory syndrome has been suggested recently [18] . Because of its ectopeptidase activity, CD13 has been implicated in the regulation of vasoactive peptides, neuropeptide hormones, and immunomodulating peptides such as interleukin-6 and -8 (IL-6 and IL-8, respectively) [19 -22] .",

[24] in 1989 proposed that the Ca \u03e9\u03e9 increase induced by anti-CD13 monoclonal antibodies (mAb) in the human monocytic cell line U-937 could result from mAb-induced formation of membrane complexes between the antigen (CD13) and the Fc\u2425Rs. The involvement of Fc\u2425Rs in CD13-mediated signaling was deduced from two observations: the effect could not be reproduced using F(ab)\u0408 2 fragments of the antibody, and the magnitude of this effect varied according to the isotype of the anti-CD13 antibody tested [24] . However, the conclusion that CD13 signals through Fc\u2425Rs has been challenged by the observation that inhibition of the enzymatic activity of CD13, which in principle would not alter the formation of the CD13-Fc\u2425R complexes, blocks the CD13-mediated signal, although other reports showed that enzymatic activity is not required for CD13-mediated signaling [26, 27] .",

These opsonized erythrocytes aggregate both types of Fc\u2425Rs expressed on the monocytic cell membrane (i.e., Fc\u2425RI and Fc\u2425RII). To visualize CD13 at different stages of the process, we stopped phagocytosis by transferring the assay tubes into ice or fixing cells with 1% PFA at 4\u00b0C.

In the initial steps of phagocytosis ( Fig. 1, E-H) , CD13 was concentrated in the zones of the membrane starting to internalize the erythrocytes (Fig. 1E , white arrows), seen in yellow in the projection (Fig.  1H) . Green fluorescence outside of the two visible erythrocytes (Fig. 1, G and H) corresponds to other erythocytes barely visible at this plane of slicing. Figure 1H corresponds to a single projection obtained by rotating the data of the original image around the x-axis.

To determine the specificity of this CD13-mediated phagocytosis, we preincubated cells with a mAb specific for CD33, another highly expressed molecule in U-937 cells, or with an unrelated IgG1 mAb (anti-DNP), and both conditions resulted in phagocytic indexes not significantly different from those obtained when the cells were incubated without antibodies (Fig. 3A) , although as expected, EBS-Ab bound to cells preincubated with the anti-CD33 mAb. Furthermore, CD13mediated phagocytosis of EBS-Ab depended on the amount of anti-CD13 mAb bound to monocytes (Fig. 3D) .",

Redistribution of CD13 to these zones is probably an active process, as incubation of monocytic cells with IgG-opsonized erythrocytes at 4\u00b0C does not induce redistribution of CD13. This also suggests that CD13 redistribution is related to the initiation of the internalization process and induced by signals generated by the Fc\u2425RI aggregation rather than simply to the binding of IgG-opsonized erythrocytes. Moreover, a significant fraction of CD13 molecules is internalized into the phagosomes with IgG-opsonized erythrocytes, suggesting a role for CD13 in phagocytosis. Additionally, some CD13-associated red fluorescence is also observed in the cytoplasm after phagocytosis. This may be attributable to endocytosis of CD13 occurring simultaneously to the phagocytic process. In this regard, Lohn et al. [33] reported endocytosis of CD13 at 37\u00b0C after occupation of the active center of CD13 with a mAb. Yet, another explanation for the presence of cytoplasmic CD13 can be the retrotranslocation of CD13 to the external phagosomal membrane (as suggested by CD13 distribution in Fig. 2A) and later, to the cytosol (Figs. 1M and 2C). Houde et al. [34] have shown retrotranslocation of phagosomal contents to the external phagosomal membrane (*) Statistically significant difference comparing Fc\u2425RI \u03e9 CD13 with Fc\u2425RI alone; P \u03fd 0.05.

Peripheral blood monocytes and U-937 cells preincubated with the anti-CD13 mAb or its F(ab)\u0408 2 fragments were able to ingest EBS-Ab, but cells preincubated without anti-CD13 mAb or with other murine mAb of the same isotype specific for another highly expressed molecule of monocytes (CD33) or for a nonrelated antigen (DNP) do not ingest EBS-Ab. Furthermore, increasing doses of anti-CD13 mAb go along with a parallel increase in phagocytosis of EBS-Ab by monocytes. These findings show that phagocytosis of EBS-Ab is mediated specifically by CD13. Thus, CD13 is not only able to positively modulate Fc\u2425RI-mediated phagocytosis, but under certain circumstances, it is able to mediate phagocytosis to an extent similar to that of Fc\u2425RI (Fig.  3D) , which might suggest that the increased phagocytic index observed when both molecules are engaged results from the sum of the individual phagocytosis. However, we cannot be certain of whether the effect of CD13 on Fc\u2425RImediated phagocytosis when both receptors are coaggregated is additive or synergistic. One point that might suggest that it is not an additive event is that the magnitude of the effect is not directly proportional to the phagocytic index observed with CD13 alone. Conversely, for a synergistic effect to be invoked, one would expect that at a given point, the phagocytosis obtained by engaging CD13 and Fc\u2425RI should be significantly higher than the sum of the phagocy- tosis mediated by each receptor alone, and this was never observed. Nevertheless, the finding that CD13 is able to modulate Fc\u2425RI-mediated phagocytosis is noteworthy regardless of the synergistic or additive origin of the phenomenon.",

From the dose-response curve (Fig. 3D) , optimal CD13-mediated phagocytosis occurs at concentrations of anti-CD13 mAb close to those required for saturation, indicating that an important fraction of CD13 should be engaged for phagocytosis to proceed. Whether these levels of CD13 engagement could be achieved in vivo is uncertain. Thus, CD13 participation in phagocytosis could be more relevant when CD13 is not the only receptor involved, especially when opsonization of the target is suboptimal.",

This clearly shows that coaggregation of CD13 results in a modification of the biochemical signal elicited by Fc\u2425RI cross-linking. The absolute requirement of Syk during Fc\u2425R-mediated phagocytosis is well established [35] , and thus, it is tempting to propose that this effect could be related to the increased phagocytosis observed when the particle is able to cross-link Fc\u2425RI and CD13. It is interesting that cross-linking of CD13 alone does not induce changes in the level of Syk phosphorylation, suggesting that CD13 cross-linking only affects the level of Syk phosphorylation when it is coaggregated with Fc\u2425RI. As CD13 was able to mediate phagocytosis, the biochemical pathways involved in this phenomenon are apparently independent of Syk phosphorylation. These results are in line with those of Navarrete Santos et al. [23] , who showed that inhibitors of tyrosine kinases were not able to block the initial Ca \u03e9\u03e9 peak induced by CD13 cross-linking in monocytes.",

Moreover, when aggregation of Fc\u2425RI is induced by an anti-Fc\u2425RI mAb and a secondary antibody, part of the CD13 population redistributes to the zones of Fc\u2425RI aggregation. Conversely, aggregation of CD13 by anti-CD13 and secondary antibody induces an almost complete redistribution of Fc\u2425RI in peripheral blood monocytes and U-937 cells.

The in vivo significance of the functional interaction between CD13 and Fc\u2425RI remains to be established. An intriguing possibility is that CD13 establishes interactions with pathogen-derived molecules and that when CD13 and Fc\u2425Rs bind to their ligands (i.e., an IgG-opsonized and CD13 ligand-containing pathogen), a positive modulation of the Fc\u2425R-mediated signal occurs. Although a natural ligand for human CD13 on the surface of a phagocytable pathogen has not been described, its role as a viral receptor is well known, and in the insect Manduca sexta and other insect species, CD13 binds the Cry1A(c) toxin of Bacillus thuringiensis [36] .

Finally, molecules known to be substrates or inhibitors of CD13 could be regarded as ligands in that they may trigger CD13-mediated signals, which given the extent of CD13 substrates described, would be of great relevance in vivo.",

Fc\u2425Rs as well as other MIRRs, such as BCR, TCR, and Fc\u03b5RI, are mostly excluded from lipid rafts but translocate into them upon clustering [44 -48] . Furthermore, there are indications that coreceptors influence the residency of MIRRs in rafts [49] . Preliminary results in our laboratory show colocalization among Fc\u2425RI, CD13, and ganglioside M1 in the zones of polarization (unpublished results). Thus, it is tempting to suggest that CD13 could modify the affinity of Fc\u2425Rs for rafts maintaining their residency there for longer periods of time. This could explain the prolongation in the peak level of Syk phosphorylation that we have observed, as Src family kinases responsible for the initial phosphorylation of tyrosines of the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif reside predominantly in these membrane domains, and Syk itself has been shown to relocate into rafts after Fc\u03b5RI aggregation [50] . Furthermore, the population of CD13 colocalizing with Fc\u2425RI during phagocytosis could correspond to that associated with rafts, taking into account that a role for lipid rafts has already been demonstrated in phagocytosis [51] .",

Cells were fixed, and CD13 was detected by incubation with TR-labeled F(ab)\u0408 2 fragments of mAb anti-CD13. (D) Redistributed CD13 in the zone of contact with erythrocytes. (E-H) U-937 cells were incubated with FITC-IgG-opsonized erythrocytes for 60 min at 37\u00b0C. Cells were chilled, and CD13 was detected by incubation with TR-labeled F(ab)\u0408 2 fragments of mAb anti-CD13. CD13 is visualized in the zones of the membrane in contact with erythrocytes (E, white arrows). Cell membranes are out of focus (see transmitted light, F), impeding detection of distribution of the rest of the population of CD13 molecules in this slice. Erythrocytes are fluorescent in the green channel (G). (H) Projection shows in yellow sites of colocalization of Fc\u2425R (IgG-opsonized erythrocytes) and CD13 (arrows). (I-L) U-937 cells were incubated with TR-labeled F(ab)\u0408 2 fragments of anti-CD13 mAb at 4\u00b0C before phagocytosis, washed, and incubated with FITC-IgG-opsonized erythrocytes for 90 min at 37\u00b0C. Noninternalized erythrocytes were lysed before observation in the confocal microscope. Erythrocytes internalized into phagosomes (J, K) are surrounded by CD13 (I). (J and L) Colocalization of the CD13-red signal with FITC-IgG-labeled erythrocytes in the phagosomes. (M-O) Similar experiment as that shown in I-L but with erythrocytes opsonized with nonlabeled IgG. CD13 is seen inside the phagosomes (M). No fluorescence is seen in the green channel (O).
