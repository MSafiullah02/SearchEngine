Furthermore, mothers with high separation anxiety (which challenges their ability to facilitate secure attachment) have infants with more nocturnal waking and lower sleep efficiency [11].

Previous research has shown that attachment anxiety is a risk factor for depressive symptoms [21] and that sleep disturbance is recognized as a symptom of depression, and it is known that depressive symptoms contribute to perceived ill health, physical symptoms and sick time [22]. We posed these questions in a secondary analysis of a database from a study of chronic stress in health-care workers [23].",

Bivariate relationships were tested between each combination of global sleep quality, attachment anxiety, depressive symptoms and health indices (physical symptom score, perceived general health and recent sick days) using Spearman's rank-order correlations. Post hoc tests of the relationship between attachment insecurity and the proportion subjects above a screening cutoff of global sleep quality (score>5) [26] were conducted to illustrate clinical significance. The hypothesis of mediation was tested using a series of regression analyses [31]. The analysis was then repeated substituting attachment avoidance for attachment anxiety.",

Since the independence of these dimensions when measured by the ECR-R has been confirmed in several studies [33], their relationship in this study is likely a characteristic of the study sample. A higher than expected intercorrelation suggests that hospital workers who are higher in one dimension of attachment insecurity tend to also be higher the other dimension. Shaver and Mikulincer [34] understand the co-occurrence of attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance (also called \u201cfearful attachment\u201d) as the result of a failure of avoidant defenses in the face of overwhelming stress. In other words, the co-occurrence of these dimensions of attachment insecurity is found in individuals who are predisposed to an avoidant response to attachment stressors (rather than an anxious\u2013preoccupied response), who then experience circumstances in which the avoidant response fails to protect them from underlying attachment-related anxiety. This formulation might help to explain the strong relationship between the dimensions of insecurity in this study, particularly if health-care workers differ from other cohorts in being more prone to avoidant and less prone to anxious\u2013preoccupied responses to attachment stressors. In that case, health-care workers who express attachment insecurity would tend to vary along a single dimension from secure to fearful (combined attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance) because it would be relatively unusual for them to express attachment anxiety alone. Although this speculation conforms to the common sense assumption that anxious attachment styles are not adaptive for those who work in hospitals and thus are underrepresented in a group of veteran (median years of experience=20) hospital workers, there is no evidence from other research that the attachment patterns of health-care workers differ from those found in the general population. Further studies of the adult attachment characteristics of health-care workers may clarify this finding. Since sex differences in adult attachment styles are modest [35], the correlation of attachment anxiety and attachment avoidance is not explained by this study being restricted to women.",

The clinical importance of this link is emphasized by the proportion of health-care workers meeting the screening cutoff for possible sleep disorder.

The pattern of these analyses was similar for these two measures of physical health. In each case the contribution of attachment anxiety to explaining variance in reported physical health is reduced by adding global sleep quality to the model and is rendered nonsignificant by entering depressive symptoms into the model. Depressive symptoms account for substantially more of the variance in indices of physical symptoms than is accounted for by attachment anxiety alone or by global sleep quality. Thus, depressive symptoms mediate the link between attachment anxiety and physical symptoms more strongly than global sleep quality does and make a further contribution to physical symptoms that is independent of attachment insecurity and global sleep quality. In order to interpret this pattern, it is useful to refer to the results of previous research. First, attachment insecurity is a risk factor for both depressive symptoms and the syndrome of major depression [21], [40]. Second, both attachment anxiety and depressive symptoms are known to be consistently related to physical symptoms [3], [22]. Thus, the strong mediating relationship of depressive symptoms is expected. What this study asks, beyond the latter relationship, is what role impaired sleep might have. It appears that impaired sleep is related to both attachment insecurity and to physical symptoms but is not as strong a mediator as depressive symptoms.",

With respect to temporal order, a mediating process must follow its cause (independent variable) and precede its effect (dependent variable) [41]. The cross-sectional study design does not allow us to test the assumption that attachment style is a stable variable that precedes sleep disturbance. Previous research indicates that adult attachment patterns are usually sufficiently stable over time to be considered trait phenomena [33], which therefore are likely to temporally precede the state phenomena of impaired sleep quality, depressive symptoms and physical symptoms. However, sleep disturbance among health-care workers is also a chronic phenomenon. Furthermore, the relationship between disturbed sleep and impaired health is complex and bidirectional. Prospective research is required to confirm the temporal sequence of the relationships found in this study. Evidence from previous research suggests that impaired sleep and depressive symptoms may have a bidirectional relationship and that chronic sleep impairment and depressive symptoms increase in concert with each other in health-care workers [42]. The current study cannot tease apart the interrelationship of sleep and depressive symptoms. Furthermore, it is not known prior to replication studies if the findings of this study can be generalized to other groups of people, given that there are several characteristics of the current cohort that are special (i.e., women in health-care professions, many of whom are shift workers).",
