The particle concentration inside the buffer room reached the level comparable with that after self-purification, which was about 0.3% of the concentration in the ward. There was no trend of increase for the particle concentration in the buffer room when the pressure difference is zero. On the contrary, this appears the different trend which was related to the residual influence by door opening, entrance and exit of people.Under the condition of the same original particle concentration, when the negative pressure difference changed from 0 to \u22126 Pa, the maximum outward leakage of pollution was converted from 4810 pc/L at 0 Pa to 2832 pc/L at \u22126 Pa, which was equivalent to the reduction rate of 41%. When the pressure difference changed from 0 to \u221230 Pa, the reduction rate was 62%. Table 2.6 shows the dimensionless concentration ratio in outward leakage airflow, which was related to the subtraction of the background concentration from the stable concentration in outward leakage airflow. It is shown from Table 2.6 that during the entrance and exit of people, the concentration ratios were comparable under the pressure difference \u22126 and \u221230 Pa. The concentration ratio under the pressure difference \u221230 Pa was (0.041 + 0.053)/2 = 0.047, while that under 0 Pa was (0.025 + 0.027)/2 = 0.026. The corresponding reduction rate was only 45%, which did not match the variation of pressure difference.\nWhen no people exits or enters with door opening and closing, the difference between the cases 0 and 30 Pa is trivial.\n",

Temperature difference also exists for such effect. With daily experience, air flows in and out with the effect of temperature difference, which cannot be weakened or offset by pressure difference. This will be explained later in detail. Therefore the pressure difference is not the only measures to prevent the invasion or outward leakage of pollution.

When the temperature indoors is larger than outdoors, or even the temperature difference is as small as 0.1 \u00b0C, the air flows outwardly at the upper region and inwardly at the lower region.

For example, the size of the bacteriophage in the processing of the monosodium glutamate factory is about 2\u20135 \u03bcm. Selleris and Herniman investigated the foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) in the natural world. Although the size itself is only 25\u201330 nm, after sampled with cascade liquid impactor, 65\u201371% of the airborne particles containing virus have sizes larger than 6 \u03bcm, and 19\u201321% have sized between 3 and 6 \u03bcm, and only 10\u201311% have sizes smaller than 3 \u03bcm. Therefore, is the number of particles containing virus with size 0.01\u20130.1 \u03bcm (or the virus particles with size 0.01\u20130.1 \u03bcm) too less [12]?",
