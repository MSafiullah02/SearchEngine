However, prolonged mechanical ventilation is associated with higher neonatal mortality and increases the risk for bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) [1, 2]. Failure of elective extubation has been independently associated with prolonged need for oxygen and ventilator support, longer hospitalization, and increased mortality. Prolonged endotracheal intubation is a major risk factor for airway injury possibly leading to tracheomalacia [3]. Each additional week of intubation and mechanical ventilation has been associated with additional risk of neurodevelopmental impairment [1, 4]. Hence, a reduction in the duration of endotracheal mechanical ventilation through a strategy that facilitates earlier, safe and successful extubation might be expected to improve the overall outcome of preterm infants.",

This asynchrony can result in an infant \u201cfighting the ventilator\u201d and higher requirements for inspired oxygen and ventilatory support. Preterm infants who are electively extubated to conventional modalities (e.g., nasal continuous positive pressure (nCPAP) or NIPPV) have a high likelihood of requiring reintubation [5]. Of the two, NIPPV has been shown to be superior to nCPAP in reducing the incidence of extubation failure (typical RR 0.70, 95% CI 0.60\u20130.80) and need for reintubation 48 h to 7 days after extubation (typical RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.65\u20130.88). The authors concluded that synchronization may be important in delivering effective noninvasive ventilation [5]. Synchronization of an infant\u2019s respiratory effort with ventilator inflation has been associated with improved oxygenation and carbon dioxide elimination [6]. It is reasonable to postulate that improved synchronization of inspiratory efforts with positive pressure inflations will allow use of lower inspired oxygen concentration and PIP, reduce ongoing lung injury caused by barovolutrauma or hyperoxia, and thereby increase the duration of sustained extubation.",

            "text": "NAVA is a newer ventilation technology that uses the patient\u2019s respiratory drive (as quantitated by the electrical activity of the diaphragm (Edi)) to control the timing, duration, and magnitude of the PIP of each breath. NAVA has been reported to increase patient-ventilator respiratory synchrony [7, 8] and unload the respiratory muscles [7, 9]. NI-NAVA has also been shown to be effective without PEEP and despite high excessive leaks (75%) of tidal volume [10]. Optimizing NAVA management protocols holds promise to facilitate and maintain successful elective extubation and thereby reduce the total duration of ventilator support. Because extubation failure is associated with significant respiratory setback, the ability to maintain extubation in a preterm infant may have significant positive impact on an infant\u2019s overall health. However, no trials have yet compared the rates of successful initial extubation between infants managed with NI-NAVA to infants managed with nCPAP or NIPPV. In fact, only one randomized controlled trial has compared NAVA with conventional ventilatory modalities [11]. In this trial we aimed to compare the success rate of initial elective extubation in preterm infants managed after extubation on NI-NAVA and NIPPV.",

Because we did not have historical data on extubation failure rates for infants managed in our unit with NI-NAVA or NIPPV and because this was a pilot (feasibility) study, we did not perform a power analysis. By recruiting 15 infants in each arm, we hoped to identify a sufficient difference that would justify a larger pivotal trial that could then be powered to demonstrate a clinically significant improvement in the primary efficacy outcome measure. We anticipated that it would not be possible to consent the parents of all eligible infants. We received IRB approval to collect data on these eligible but nonenrolled infants during the study period. Because the study only defined extubation and reintubation criteria and all infants (enrolled or not) were managed according to the study/institutional protocol we felt that outcome assessment of these infants would provide additional relevant information. Statistical support was provided by the Center for Health Equity and Quality Research at UFCOM. All analyses were performed on an intent-to-treat approach. Continuous variables were summarized using means, medians, and standard deviations. Categorical variables were summarized using counts, proportions, and percentages. The primary outcome was compared between the two groups using chi-square test or Fisher\u2019s exact test. Secondary outcomes were compared using Wilcoxon rank sum test (continuous variables) or chi-square/Fisher\u2019s exact test (categorical variables). The level of significance was set at 0.05. All analyses were performed using SAS\u00ae for Windows Version 9 (SAS\u00ae Version 9.4 for Windows, Cary, NC: SAS Institute Inc.; 2008).",

Clinicians will gravitate to ventilatory strategies that are demonstrated to forestall invasive ventilation, facilitate earlier elective intubation, and/or reduce the total days of invasive ventilatory support [18]. A recent Cochrane review compared the effectiveness of NIPPV and nCPAP after extubation [5]. The meta-analyses demonstrated a statistically and clinically significant reduction in the risk of meeting extubation failure criteria (typical RR 0.70, NNTB 8, 95% CI 6\u201313) and subsequent reintubation (typical RR 0.76, NNTB 10, 95% CI 7\u201320) in favor of NIPPV [5].",

More effective synchronization using NAVA may allow adequate gas exchange to occur at lower peak airway pressures and hence NAVA might be expected to reduce cumulative lung barovolutrauma. Preliminary studies of NAVA have been promising but randomized controlled trials (RCT) to confirm this efficacy are still limited. A recent Cochrane review found only one RCT that compared NAVA to patient-triggered time-cycled pressure-limited ventilation and found no significant difference in duration of mechanical ventilation or, rates of BPD, pneumothorax, or IVH [11]. This study reported lower peak PIP in the NAVA arm. This trial included moderately preterm infants (28\u201336 completed weeks\u2019 gestational age) and did not report any data specifically related to the success of elective extubation [21]. To our knowledge, no trial has compared the rates of successful elective extubation in infants managed with NI-NAVA vs infants managed with conventional ventilator modalities after extubation. Our study is the first reported RCT that has compared NI-NAVA to NIPPV with respect to achieving a successful initial elective extubation in preterm infants as young as 24 weeks\u2019 gestational age.",

These rates equalized by 12 days after elective extubation. Our study adopted \u201csuccessful extubation\u201d as a primary outcome defined as continuous extubation for 120 h after the initial elective extubation. This definition is consistent with the one adopted in a secondary analysis of the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Neonatal Research Network\u2019s Surfactant, Positive Pressure, and Oxygenation Randomized Trial [1]. However, no consensus exists on a common definition of what duration of sustained extubation would best define extubation success, with reported durations ranging from 72 h to 7 days [22]. A longer window of observation would identify a greater number of reintubated infants but in many cases later reintubation is done for reasons unrelated to the initial respiratory condition (e.g., late-onset sepsis and NEC). In fact, a recent systematic review of studies undertaken to define the ideal duration of extubation success in preterm infants less than 1000 g at birth did document that reintubation rates steadily increased with prolongation of the window of observation without any plateau (p = 0.001) [23].",

These authors concluded that clinicians should attempt to extubate extremely low birth infants managed on low ventilator settings, even when success is not guaranteed [28]. Similarly, an earlier study of 262 preterm infants with gestational age \u226428 weeks intubated on day of life 1 noted that infants extubated after 7 days of age were more likely to develop BPD or to meet the combined outcome of BPD and/or death. Infants who were extubated early but required later reintubation had a lower incidence of BPD/death compared with infants who were extubated later [29]. In our study, the time to first reintubation after the initial elective extubation was a median of 18 days in the NI-NAVA group and a median of 4 days in the NIPPV group.

            "text": "Mechanical ventilation is an established risk factor for BPD. Alveolar overdistention, intra- and extra-pulmonary air leaks and injury to small airway epithelium are manifestations of barovolutrauma caused by invasive mechanical ventilation [30]. Damage to the vocal cords and subglottic area as well as abnormal tracheal development are potential adverse effects of an indwelling endotracheal tube. Ventilation strategies in preterm infants that aim to protect the lung and small airways from injury have in common the goals to minimize ventilator pressures and achieve physiologically appropriate tidal volumes. Timely removal of the endotracheal tube that results in sustained extubation will reduce the risk of injury to the large airways and vocal cords and surrounding structures. In this light, it is notable that study infants extubated to NI-NAVA were managed with significantly lower PIPs than infants managed with NIPPV. This finding is consistent with previous studies that have shown that preterm infants on invasive NAVA were managed on lower PIP compared with conventional ventilation [19, 31]. One of these studies that used a crossover design showed that NAVA-ventilated infants also were managed with lower FiO2 and IMV rate, achieved a lower PCO2, and demonstrated greater compliance compared with pressure-controlled ventilation [31]. A second randomized crossover study reported that PIP and work of breathing, but not the fraction of inspired oxygen or mean airway pressure, were lower for infants on NAVA compared with infants managed with conventional ventilation [32]. The only other randomized trial that compared NAVA with standard ventilation also reported use of a lower PIP (p = 0.02) with NAVA [21].",

In fact, at the time we conceived this study, the literature provided no guidance concerning extubation success rates for NI-NAVA. Our protocol did not specify NI-NAVA management beyond the study period nor did it fully define ventilator management of infants extubated to NIPPV. Hence, variability in NIPPV management and/or physician bias due to the unblinded nature of the randomized treatment could have affected the primary study outcome and variability in management of both modalities might have affected secondary outcomes. The study lacked a sophisticated automated continuous analysis of the pressures and instead we relied on the EMR for PIP values averaged over each 24-h period.",
