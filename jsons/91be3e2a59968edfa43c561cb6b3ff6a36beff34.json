The attendance was about 250 contacts, with many questions raised during the conference. The presentation was very instructive and brain storming. After the conference, and based on current evidence, we developed the hypothesis that the general management of the infection of SARS-CoV-2 should be revised. The considerations that we will present are purely clinical and do not take into account the logistic setting of hospital beds [1] . We would like to raise 3 questions.",

NIV most often fixes the pO 2 and helps maintaining PO 2 /FiO 2 ratio (P/F) in a reasonable range, but in many cases this improvement is just temporary and acute respiratory failure develops [4] .

Evidence from the H1N1 outbreak strongly suggest that in many or most cases NIV is ineffective and that early intubated patients have a better prognosis [5] . In Wuhan, 76% of a small group of critically ill patients were non-responsive to NIV [4] . It should be considered that any attempt to re-balance the respiratory function with NIV can cause a delay in intubation. Direct evidence on the consequences of delayed intubation in COVID-19 patients is not yet available. However, contacts with emergency room doctors, trained in my department at the University of Naples Federico II, who are managing patients with COVID-19 confirmed the same experience as with H1N1: early intubated patients seem to exhibit better outcome (personal communication). Analyses on retrospective data on this matter are urgently needed.",

Hundreds of scientists are now working on different pharmacologic/immunologic approaches, in order to fight the viral invasion. These include specific anti-viral drugs, molecular targets to inhibit cell entry and vaccines. Another approach, which was proposed at the time of the Ebola outbreak, focuses on increasing the host resistance against the viral invasion [6] . The administration of convalescent sera [7] , anti-inflammatory agents and specific cytokine-inhibition by administration of tocilizumab (a monoclonal antibody blocking IL6 and approved for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis) were tested with some apparent success in Wuhan [8] and in Naples, Italy. A clinical trial with tocilizumab has been recently approved for COVID-19 in Italy. Several trials are on-going on all these possibilities, as reported in the COVID-19 Science Report of University of Singapore (https://sph.nus. edu.sg/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/COVID-19-Science-Report-Therapeutics-23-Mar.pdf).",
