            "text": "Taiwan has been acclaimed for a relatively low number of coronavirus disease (COVID-19) confirmed cases and case-fatality rates by its timely and fast response to the COVID-19 pandemic [1]. Taiwan activated the Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) for the COVID-19 outbreak after the first case was confirmed on January 21, 2020, in Taiwan, and this center responsible for executing control policies including border control, surveillance, quarantine, and resource allocation to prevent the spread of COVID-19 in communities [2]. The crucial factor that renders these control measures successful is comprehensive, precise, and timely contact tracing to identify and manage the potential secondary cases and to interrupt further onward transmission. However, the conventional epidemiological contact tracing, which relies on personal interviews is labor-intensive and time-consuming, may not be feasible when dealing with a pandemic with rapid propagation such as COVID-19. To enable more efficient and effective contact investigation, several digital databases such as electronic health records, phone-based GPS, card transaction, records, and closed-circuit television have been applied in South Korea [3]. Other contributory factors that are effective and efficient to contain transmission are quarantine, isolation, and surveillance of disease progression of COVID-19 after contact tracing. To achieve these two aims, a systematic and efficient big data method, using digital technology, sensor data, and claimed health insurance data, may strengthen the conventional contact tracing and disease surveillance and inform the following control measures or mitigation plan. The scientific society in Taiwan thus called for an innovative and integrated approach by making use of current digital technologies and big data on sensor and claimed health insurance to reach the aim of precision prevention for outbreak and surveillance of disease outcome among these contacts.",

The first entry restriction on foreigners from pandemic areas such as China in response to COVID-19 was initiated on January 28, 2020. The government also kept watch on the cruise ships coming to Taiwan, which included the Diamond Princess cruise ship docked at Keelung harbor in Taiwan, on January 31, 2020.

The mobile position method might not be as exact as GPS but the latter may infringe on individual confidentiality. The contact locations were ascertained on the basis of the roaming signals with time of exposure over 30 minutes from multimobile base stations between 5 AM and 8 PM that were recognized as the major tracking routes. Based on the mobile signal registered to the base stations of five domestic telecom operators, the first challenge was to identify the 3000 passengers out of all tourists in Keelung area. According to the record, the cruise was moored at the harbor from 6 AM to 6 PM. We then checked the data between 1 hour before and 2 hours after the cruise docked at Keelung harbor.

We noted an age-standardized relative ratio of 0.929 (95% CI 0.923-0.935) for the contact population diagnosed as having respiratory syndrome, relative to the general population. Similarly, there was a lower risk for pneumonia among the contact population compared with the general population (age-standardized relative ratio 0.915, 95% CI 0.869-0.963).

When facing the global crisis of an emerging infectious disease such as COVID-19, rapid response and immediate interventions for preventing the outbreak are essential. Smart contact tracing with big sensor data on mobile position data and its connected mobile phone can provide information in a timely manner and help crisis management under such a situation. In this study, we demonstrated how smart contact tracing can be applied to the contact history between Taiwanese people and the possible infected passengers who disembarked from the Diamond Princess cruise ship just before the outbreak of COVID-19 on the cruise ship.",

Although over 190 contact persons per traveler might not be realistic, increasing the targeted contact population with no harm was acceptable as a step against COVID-19 spread in this emergency situation. Moreover, it should be noted that providing accurate, timely information for decision making is crucial during the crisis. It had been a few days since the exposure of infected hosts had occurred. Contact tracing and management using information technology had to be quickly implemented without delay. This is one of the advantages of using big data technology for analysis. In terms of fighting against COVID-19, similar big data technologies have been applied in the spatial tracking of patients for tracking virus transmission and potential spatiotemporal exposure, to support the epidemiological investigation with rapid analysis [11].",
