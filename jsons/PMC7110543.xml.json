These factors, combined with the common use of antibiotics among pilgrims, make the etiology of pneumonia during Hajj complex, and hence standard guidelines for the management of the disease may not always work during this mass-gathering event.",

This may be of importance, as organisms not included in the panel such as M. tuberculosis, Enterobacteriaceae, P. aeruginosa, and fungi, have been reported as causative agents of pneumonia during Hajj.3, 17, 18 Also, we only used sputum samples for identification, and no microbiological investigations of other samples (e.g. blood) were performed to confirm the cause of pneumonia. Finally, some of the organisms identified may have been respiratory tract colonizers and not the causative agents. In this context, a strength of our study is that the sputum samples were obtained on admission and before the start of antibiotic therapy. Collecting sputum samples after the start of antibiotic treatment would have been of little value as it would have detected mainly respiratory tract colonizers.",

However, we detected a variety of pathogens in sputum samples of the patients, with most samples containing more than one agent. This observation, along with previous reports on CAP in Hajj, indicates that typical pneumonia treatment regimens may not work well during the Hajj season due to the wide variety of organisms that may be involved. This may necessitate more active investigations into the causes of pneumonia for identification and sensitivity testing in order to provide optimal treatment and a good outcome. Molecular methods can be a quick and sensitive means to determine the possible causative agents. Pneumonia is a significant illness during Hajj and interventions to reduce its burden during the pilgrimage should be adopted. Measures to reduce respiratory tract infections during Hajj are already in place.31 Other strategies may include improved respiratory tract infection surveillance and optimization and dissemination of recommendations for adult vaccination.32, 33 Continuous surveillance for MERS-CoV during Hajj and outside the pilgrimage season is crucial to monitor the MERS-CoV situation in Saudi Arabia.",
