[5] [6] [7] Gene 3 is functionally tricistronic, 8 expressing three proteins, 3a, 3b, and 3c, the latter being the structural E protein of IBV. 9 Expression studies have indicated that translation of the E protein is initiated as a result of ribosomes binding to a structure formed by the preceding 3a and 3b sequences. 10, 11 Gene 5 is functionally bicistronic and expresses two proteins, 5a and 5b, which are expressed in IBV-infected cells. 12 To investigate the requirement for the 3a, 3b, 5a, and 5b proteins for replication, we have used our reverse genetic system [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] to produce isogenic recombinant IBVs (rIBVs), after site-specific mutagenesis of the appropriate sequences, with specific modifications in genes 3 and 5.",

AY646283), all contain a tricistronic gene 3 and a bicistronic gene 5, the latter located between the M and N genes. The conservation of the gene 3 and 5 sequences in IBV and IBV-like viruses, isolated from other avian species, indicate they may play a role in the virus replication cycle. In order to determine whether the 3a, 3b, 5a, and 5b proteins are required for the replication of IBV, we have used a number of alternative ways to oblate the expression of these gene products. We modified the IBV genome corresponding to gene 3 by scrambling the 3a and 3b initiation codons, either singly or together, and by deleting the sequence corresponding to 3a3b. We have shown that 3a is no longer produced after scrambling of the AUG or deletion of the sequence (Unpublished data, Hodgson et al.) . We modified gene 5 by scrambling the 5a and 5b initiation codons, either singly or together, and by scrambling the sg mRNA 5 TAS preventing expression of the sg mRNA. We have shown that sg mRNA 5 is no longer produced after scrambling of the TAS and that 5b is no longer produced after scrambling of the AUG. 16 Comparison of the growth kinetics of the rIBV with Beau-R, on CK cells, showed that there were no differences (Fig. 4) , demonstrating that neither the IBV 3a, 3b, 5a, nor 5b proteins are essential for replication per se; they can be considered to be accessory proteins. We have rescued a rIBV that lacks expression of 3a and 3b, after deletion of their sequences, and lacks expression of 5a and 5b after scrambling of the gene 5 TAS indicating that both sets of gene products are dispensable in vitro.
