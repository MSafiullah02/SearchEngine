Hypothermia, acidosis, and hypocalcemia should be avoided. Blood products are continued where clinically indicated while awaiting return of graft function. In situations of treatment-resistant nonsurgical bleeding, the off-label use of factor VIIa (90 IU/kg) has been shown to be of potential benefit [36]. Etiological factors leading to bleeding include underlying poor graft function and coagulopathy, massive transfusion, poor hemostasis, inadequate product replacement, heparin release from the implanted graft, and post-reperfusion syndrome [19]. In patients with portal hypertension, fibrinolysis and thrombocytopenia may also be contributing factors.",

Graft failure requiring retransplantation after 7 days can be termed delayed PNF. Petrowski and Busuttil categorize risk factors into donor, procurement, and recipient related [44]. Donor factors include advanced donor age, liver macrosteatosis, and warm ischemia after circulatory death. Procurement factors include poor organ flush or cooling after cross clamp, inappropriate preservation, and cold ischemia >12 h. Recipient factors are poor vascular inflow, prolonged warm ischemia, retransplantation or cardiac arrest after reperfusion [44\u201346].

Presentation is similar to PNF with central nervous system (CNS) changes, resistant coagulopathy, oliguria, hypoglycemia, and elevated transaminases. Treatment is supportive involving administration of FFP, dextrose to control hypoglycemia, hemodynamic support, and correction of metabolic disturbances. Novel supportive therapies have been described using prostaglandin E1, N-acetylcysteine, and liver assist devices [19, 44].

Early doppler ultrasonography is routinely used to evaluate artery patency. Contributing factors include hemoconcentration, hypercoagulability, poor arterial flow, increased sinusoidal resistance, and anastomotic stenosis [19]. Divided into early and late thrombosis, the former usually presents with problems related to graft function. Late thrombosis (>30 days post transplant) [47\u2022] often presents with biliary complications and a milder clinical course. HAT has been reported to occur in up to 9 % of adult recipients [44] with an increased incidence in children and grafts where size discrepancy exists between donor artery and native vessel [19, 48]. Operative exploration is the gold standard for diagnosis with surgical treatment including thrombectomy with anastomotic revision, aortic conduit graft, or arterial/vein interposition graft [49\u2022]. Endovascular treatment using intra-arterial thrombolysis, embolization, or percutaneous transluminal angioplasty has lower success rates but may be appropriate in some patients [50, 51].

Preoperative predisposing factors include increased disease severity, high-grade encephalopathy, large volume ascites, pleural effusions, severe pulmonary artery hypertension, and pre-existing hypoxia from ventilation/perfusion mismatch or hepatopulmonary syndrome [55\u2022]. Intraoperatively, a large volume transfusion, positive fluid balance, and excessive use of fresh frozen plasma or platelets may contribute to pulmonary edema and potential lung injury [56]. Postoperatively, respiratory dysfunction may arise from atelectasis, pleural effusion, volume overload, infection, adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and transfusion-related acute lung injury [55\u2022].",

Pneumonias require isolation of responsible microorganism with prompt instigation of appropriately targeted antibiotic therapy [55\u2022]. Ventilation parameters should be tailored to the patients underlying dysfunction. For pulmonary edema and ARDS, low tidal volumes (6 mL/kg), avoidance of alveolar overdistension, and lower plateau airway pressures are beneficial [1]. PEEP should be set to improve oxygenation without restricting liver outflow. Debate exists as to whether high PEEP impairs liver blood outflow [1]. Saner et al., however, showed that PEEP up to 15 cm H2O did not decrease hepatic vein outflow or portal blood flow [57].",
