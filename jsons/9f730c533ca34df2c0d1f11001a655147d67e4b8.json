Results: Compared to molecular detection, the sensitivities of serum IgM and IgG antibodies to diagnose COVID-19 were 48.1% and 88.9%, and the specificities were 100% and 90.9%, respectively.In the COVID-19 group, the IgM-positive rate increased slightly at first and then decreased over time; in contrast, the IgGpositive rate increased to 100% and was higher than IgM at all times. The IgM-positive rate and titer were not significantly different before and after conversion to virus-negative. The IgG-positive rate was up to 90% and not significantly different before and after conversion to virus-negative. However, the median IgG titer after conversion to virus-negative was double that before, and the difference was significant.",

Moreover, the IgG titers of the three positive patients in the control group were only weakly positive. In the COVID-19 group, IgM and IgG were also both found to be positive in one case before laboratory confirmation for the first time. Therefore, COVID-19 should be considered when serum IgM or IgG is positive. In the COVID-19 patients, the IgG-positive rate (88.9%) was found to be higher than the IgM-positive rate (48.1%) before conversion to virus-negative by molecular detection. Interestingly, three IgG-negative patients were also IgMnegative in this study. The duration from symptom onset to this serological test in these three patients was 0 days, 5 days, and 8 days, respectively. Furthermore, it was observed that serum viral antibodies increased only slightly in the early stage of the disease. Hence, it may be that serum viral antibodies have not been produced yet and could be undetectable. Zhang et al. found that the IgM and IgG positive rates were 50% and 81% on day 0 (the day of first sampling) and increased to 81% and 100%, respectively, on day 5 . Thus, COVID-19 cannot be excluded at an early stage when viral serological testing is negative. The IgM-positive rate showed a trend to increase at first and then decline; however, the IgG-positive rate increased and then became stable over time. Furthermore, the IgG-positive rate was consistently higher than the IgM-positive rate, and this phenomenon was also observed in the study by Zhang et al. (2020) . There were two patients with both IgM and IgG negative after oral swabs were negative twice. The interval between laboratory confirmation and serological testing was 10 days for one of these patients and 14 days for the other. A lag period was found, as antibodies specifically targeting MERS-CoV would normally appear between 14 and 28 days after the illness onset (Al Johani and Hajeer, 2016) . Therefore, we cannot infer whether viral antibodies have not been produced yet or have turned negative, because of the use of only one serological test. As well as the high positive rate, we found that the IgG titer after conversion to virus-negative was double that before. In this study, these COVID-19 patients were discharged soon after oral swabs were negative on two occasions. Whether higher antibodies titers in SARS-CoV-2 infection are associated with better outcomes needs to be studied further.",
