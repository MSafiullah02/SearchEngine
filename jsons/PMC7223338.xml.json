            "text": "Chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) are synthetic receptors that redirect lymphocytes to recognize and eliminate cells expressing a cognate target ligand1. CAR T cells targeted at cancer cells are the most widely studied form of this technology. Following the demonstration of remarkable response rates in patients with large B cell lymphoma or acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL)2\u20135, adoptive transfer of autologous CD19-targeted CAR T cells became the first therapeutic approach with a genetic engineering component to be approved by the FDA for use in the USA6,7. Investigators are attempting to broaden the therapeutic benefits of CAR T cells by combining them with numerous other types of anticancer therapies (previously reviewed elsewhere8) or through innovations in CAR design to address the safety and production issues associated with the currently approved agents as well as to enhance their efficacy and overcome treatment resistance. In parallel, novel CAR engineering strategies are being developed to expand the clinical successes achieved with CAR T cells to patients with other malignancies, including solid cancers. In this Review, we provide an overview of basic CAR design and discuss emerging strategies to engineer safer and more effective CAR T cells for the treatment of haematological and solid cancers.",

            "text": "The antigen-binding domain is the extracellular portion of the CAR that recognizes the target antigen and redirects the specificity of CAR-expressing lymphocytes accordingly (Fig. 1). The antigen-binding domains of CARs have traditionally been composed of the variable heavy (VH) and variable light (VL) chains of monoclonal antibodies, connected by a flexible linker to form a single-chain variable fragment (scFv)9. The (Gly4Ser)3 peptide is the most commonly used linker, exploiting glycine residues for flexibility and serine residues for solubility and resulting in a properly folded scFv capable of antigen recognition and binding10. CARs classically contain scFvs targeting extracellular antigens of cell-surface proteins expressed by cancer cells, thus enabling major histocompatibility complex (MHC)-independent T cell activation; however, MHC-dependent, T cell receptor (TCR)-mimic CARs that enable the recognition of intracellular tumour-associated antigens (TAAs) have also been described11\u201314. CARs have also been engineered with scFvs that bind to soluble ligands present in the tumour microenvironment (TME), such as transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF\u03b2)15, in order to convert an immunosuppressive signal often present in solid tumours into a potent T cell activator.",

For example, the mode of interaction between the VH and VL chains, and thus the relative position of the complementarity-determining regions, can affect the specificity and affinity of the CAR for its target antigen19. Importantly, scFv affinity for the target antigen is a fundamental determinant of CAR function and should be high enough to effectively recognize tumour cells and induce CAR signalling and T cell activation; however, excessively high affinity can lead to activation-induced cell death (AICD) of the CAR-expressing cell and, potentially, toxicities20\u201325. Adding to the complexity of CAR design, the use of different scFvs with similar affinities for the same target protein can have dissimilar effects on CAR T cell function18. Target antigen density and epitope location are also crucial factors to consider in identifying an ideal scFv for CAR engineering in order to optimize binding of the CAR to its target. Finally, certain scFvs are associated with ligand-independent tonic signalling, which has been shown reduce the efficacy of CAR T cell therapy in preclinical models by leading to terminal effector T cell differentiation, exhaustion and/or AICD17,26.",

The transmembrane domain used influences the stability and function of the CAR45,46. For example, CARs containing the CD28 transmembrane domain are more stable than those harbouring the transmembrane region of CD3\u03b647. Interestingly, however, the CD3\u03b6 transmembrane domain mediates CAR dimerization and incorporation into endogenous TCRs, which might facilitate CAR-mediated T cell activation45. CAR T cells with CD8\u03b1 hinge and transmembrane domains have been shown to release less IFN\u03b3 and TNF and are less susceptible to AICD than those in which these domains are derived from CD28 (ref.36).",

The vast majority of CARs activate CAR T cells via CD3\u03b6-derived immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs. However, signalling mediated by these motifs alone is insufficient to induce productive T cell responses and results in limited in vivo T cell persistence and activity48; a co-stimulatory signal is necessary for optimal T cell function, metabolism and persistence. T cells with CARs containing co-stimulatory domains in addition to activation domains produce IL-2 and can proliferate upon repeated antigen exposure49. The most widely studied co-stimulatory domains are derived from CD28 or 4-1BB (CD137), and CAR T cell products utilizing either of these domains are FDA approved6,7. CD28-domain CAR T cells and 4-1BB-domain CAR T cells are both associated with high response rates in patients but have different functional and metabolic profiles50. T cells expressing CARs with CD28 domains differentiate into effector memory T cells and predominantly utilize aerobic glycolysis, whereas 4-1BB-containing CAR T cells differentiate into central memory T (TCM) cells and have increased mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative metabolism51. T cells with CARs containing alternative co-stimulatory domains have demonstrated efficacy in preclinical models but have not yet been tested in patients. These domains include those derived from MYD88 and CD40 (ref.52), OX40 (CD134)53,54, inducible T cell co-stimulator (ICOS)55, CD27 (refs56,57) and killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptor 2DS2 (KIR2DS2; combined with co-expression of TYRO protein tyrosine kinase-binding protein, also known as DAP12)58.",

The degree and kinetics of CAR T cell activation is influenced by the overall tumour burden, the level of antigen expression on the tumour cells, the affinity of the scFv (or other antigen-binding domain) for the antigen and the co-stimulatory elements included in the CAR, along with other factors64,65. Thus, the therapeutic window of CAR T cell activation will be different with different CARs and will need to be established for each CAR using careful dose-escalation schedules in phase I trials.

Thus, the choice of co-stimulatory domain offers a modifiable variable in CAR design that can potentially be tailored to the tumour type and burden, the target antigen and antigen density, and the specific CAR scFv used. Inclusion of a 4-1BB co-stimulatory domain might be sufficient and less toxic in patients with a high disease burden and/or with tumours with a high antigen density (resulting in a high CAR scFv avidity); however, a CD28 domain might be needed to reach the required threshold of T cell activation in the context of a low total surface antigen density and/or a CAR with a low-affinity antigen-binding domain.",

In preclinical models, inhibition of the macrophage-activating and monocyte-activating cytokine GM-CSF using the antibody lenzilumab increases CAR T cell activity while decreasing the risk of CRS, and mutational inactivation of GM-CSF in the transduced T cells has similar effects69,70. Similarly, preclinical evidence implicates IL-1 released by monocytes and/or macrophages in CAR T cell-associated CRS and ICANS71,72. Accordingly, IL-1 receptor antagonists, either administered systemically or secreted from engineered CAR T cells, ameliorate CRS and neurotoxicity in mouse models of leukaemia or lymphoma treated with anti-CD19 CAR T cells71,72. In addition, myeloid cell-specific deletion of tyrosine hydroxylase or inhibition of this enzyme using metyrosine reduces circulating catecholamine and, in turn, cytokine levels after anti-CD19 CAR T cell therapy in a mouse model of lymphoma73. Further modification of these pathways through CAR T cell engineering could provide opportunities to reduce the toxicity of these agents. Alternatively, CARs can be engineered to recognize bi-specific adapter molecules that also contain moieties that bind to receptors expressed on cancer cells (for example, folate receptors), thus bridging CAR T cells and cancer cells (Fig. 2Aa); dosing of these short half-life, small-molecule adaptors can then be controlled dynamically in order prevent or terminate CRS74,75.",

Accordingly, dasatinib rapidly and reversibly prevented CAR T cell activation and, when administered shortly (3 hours) after cell infusion, markedly reduced mortality from CAR T cell-induced CRS in a mouse model of lymphoma82.

            "text": "Successful use of CAR T cells in the treatment of patients with B cell malignancies has been associated with B cell aplasia and resultant hypogammaglobulinaemia owing to CAR T cell-mediated eradication of CD19+ B cell progenitors in the bone marrow83. This widely observed toxicity of anti-CD19 CAR T cells is well tolerated and treatable with periodic infusions of intravenous immunoglobulins to replace antibodies that would otherwise have been produced by the patient's B cells. The potential for less tolerable on-target, off-tumour toxicities with agents targeting other candidate TAAs limits the clinical use of many CAR T cell products. In a clinical trial of a carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX)-targeted CAR T cell product involving patients with renal cell carcinoma, multiple patients developed liver enzyme abnormalities84. These adverse effects were attributed to CAR T cell infiltration into the CAIX-expressing bile duct epithelium and were prevented in subsequent patients through the administration of an antagonistic anti-CAIX monoclonal antibody84, providing strong evidence of on-target, off-tumour toxicities. Much more alarmingly, a patient receiving HER2-directed CAR T cell therapy for metastatic colon cancer developed respiratory distress and pulmonary oedema 15 minutes after cell infusion, which progressed to multiorgan failure and death85. The mechanism of this toxicity was speculated to be mediated by recognition of HER2 in non-malignant lung tissue by CAR T cells, triggering a systemic cytokine storm85. Of note, HER2 is expressed at low levels in many non-malignant tissues, and the antibody trastuzumab, on which the CAR was based, has known on-target, off-tumour effects86. All other elements of the trial protocol, including the history of agents targeting HER2, the type of retrovirus used to generate CAR T cells and the T cell dose, were determined based on clinical experience to be safe85, supporting the evidence suggesting that CAR T cell responses to HER2 expressed on non-malignant lung cells caused the toxicity. However, the onset of symptoms only 15 minutes after infusion is uncharacteristic of T cell-mediated responses. Moreover, the clinical presentation resembled acute respiratory distress syndrome85, which often occurs as a result of inflammation from a source outside of the lungs (for example, the bloodstream or pancreas, or as a sequelae of transfusion-related lung injury), and therefore the cytokine storm could potentially have resulted from an immune process unrelated to the CAR interacting with HER2 in lung tissue. HER2-targeted CARs used in trials involving patients with sarcoma have been better tolerated, with no reported CRS or ICANS87. Nevertheless, similar episodes of pulmonary oedema, including one fatal event, have occurred in patients with glioma after treatment with a CAR T cell product targeting EGFR variant III (EGFRvIII)88, although, again, without definitive evidence of a specific interaction of the CAR with EGFR expressed on non-malignant lung cells. Less severe pulmonary toxicities have also been observed in a trial of CAR T cells targeting carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 5 (CEACAM5), specifically in all of four patients who received a high CAR T cell dose (a total of 0.33\u20133.89 \u00d7 109 viable cells) and intensive preconditioning with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine89. These toxicities were hypothesized to be attributable to interactions between CAR T cells and non-malignant CEACAM5-expressing cells in the lung; however, no definitive evidence of such interactions was established and no gastrointestinal toxicities were observed89, despite the known expression of CEACAM5 in the gastrointestinal tract. Considering the variations in co-stimulatory domains, conditioning regimens, cytokine administration and CAR T cell dosing used in these studies, and that some of these toxicities are hard to distinguish from general cytokine-related toxicities, establishing whether the clinical complications reflect on-target, off-tumour effects is difficult. Nonetheless, technologies designed to limit on-target, off-tumour toxicities could provide opportunities to generate more clinically effective CAR therapies, and numerous approaches are currently in development90. These strategies are predicated on the targeting of antigens more specific to the tumour, optimizing the interaction of CARs with cancer cells relative to non-malignant cells (Fig. 3Aa\u2013d), introducing the requirement for multiple antigens or the absence of a specific antigen (logic-gated CARs) (Fig. 3Ba) and/or limiting the spatial and temporal activity of CARs (Fig. 3Bb).",

Antigens expressed at higher levels on tumour cells than on non-malignant cells could potentially be targeted using lower-affinity scFv CARs, thereby ensuring that only the tumour cells with a high antigen density can provide interactions of sufficiently high avidity to activate CAR T cells. The feasibility of this approach has been demonstrated in preclinical models, across a range of different antigens, although downregulation of the target antigen has been identified as a mechanism of resistance23,91,92. In one preclinical study in which the affinity of a ganglioside GD2-targeted CAR was dramatically increased through a single amino acid substitution in the antigen-binding domain93, mice developed fatal encephalitis attributed to the interaction of CAR T cells with GD2+ cerebellar tissue that has not been observed with the lower-affinity GD2 CAR in preclinical models or clinical trials. This finding illustrates the profound effects that subtle changes in the scFv can have on the therapeutic window of CAR T cells.",

            "text": "Synthetic biology paradigms have also been used to increase the specificity of CAR T cells for tumour cells based on the detection of multiple antigens in order to overcome the lack of unique tumour-specific antigens. The synNotch system94 involves the use of a synthetic Notch receptor engineered to recognize one TAA, activation of which induces the expression of a second construct encoding a CAR specific to a second TAA and containing T cell activation domains \u2014 thus creating an \u201cAND\u201d logic gate requiring the simultaneous presence of two cell-surface antigens for CAR T cell activation (Fig. 3Ba). This system has been used to target tumour cells expressing the antigen ROR1 (ref.95), which is also present on essential bone marrow stromal cells and in other tissues; gating for expression of epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) or B7-H3 as secondary antigens was demonstrated to increase the tumour-cell specificity and reduce the risk of toxicities in animal models, compared with traditional CAR T cells targeting ROR1 alone95. However, the slow activation kinetics of such logic-gated CAR T cells might limit the efficacy of this approach. A similar logic-gating effect can be achieved by linking the CD3\u03b6 and co-stimulatory domains to separate receptors, each recognizing different antigens (thus utilizing a first-generation CAR construct in combination with a chimeric co-stimulatory receptor) (Fig. 3Aa). The promise of this approach has been demonstrated in preclinical models of prostate cancer96, breast cancer97 and other experimental systems98. An analogous approach involves the use of secondary chimeric cytokine receptors for tumour cell-derived cytokines, such as IL-4, to restrict T cell activity to tumour tissue90,99 (Fig. 3Ad), although with the drawback that these inflammatory cytokines are not strictly tumour specific. A related strategy is predicated on the use of inhibitory CARs, which are engineered to inhibit T cell activation upon binding to an antigen expressed on non-malignant cells but not tumour cells, thus ensuring that productive signalling by a co-expressed activatory CAR only occurs in tumours. Instead of co-stimulatory domains, the inhibitory CARs contain inhibitory domains derived from immune-checkpoint proteins, such as cytotoxic lymphocyte protein 4 (CTLA-4) or programmed cell death 1 (PD-1), thereby co-opting the intrinsic immune-checkpoint signalling pathways of T cells100 (Fig. 3Ab).",

Transient expression of CARs can be achieved by using mRNA rather than integrating DNA vectors to transduce T cells with the CAR construct21,102. Potentially toxic CAR T cell products can also be controlled using various \u2018on-switches\u2019, including pharmacological agents that mediate transient activating structural changes of the CAR constructs such as dimerization of different peptide chains containing dissociated, trans-acting activatory and co-stimulatory domains103,104 (Fig. 2Ab).",

Thus, engineering strategies are being developed to address this issue, including altering the co-stimulatory domain of the CAR to decrease the intensity of the signal, for example, by mutating some of the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs within the CD28 domain124\u2013126. Modulation of the co-stimulatory signal can also be achieved through co-expression of ligands for auto-stimulation and trans-stimulation of CAR T cells. For example, seeking to combine the rapid activatory kinetics afforded by the CD28 co-stimulatory domains and the better persistence associated with the 4-1BB domain, Zhao et al.127 demonstrated that co-expression of 4-1BBL on CAR T cells with CD28 co-stimulatory domains results in armoured CAR T cells with a longer duration of persistence, decreased expression of exhaustion markers and a high CD8+ to CD4+ T cell ratio compared with CAR T cells expressing only CD28-based or 4-1BB-based CARs (Fig. 4Bb). These 4-1BBL-expressing CAR T cells are currently being tested in clinical trials in patients with relapsed CD19+ haematological malignancies (NCT03085173)128.",

Several technologies have been developed to create universal CARs for which adapter elements are used as ligands to enable the targeting of multiple antigens with a single CAR T cell population (Fig. 4Ac). For example, avidin-linked CARs (named biotin-binding immune receptors) in combination with biotinylated antibodies can be used not only to control CAR T cell activity similar to a safety switch but also to target multiple antigens, either sequentially or simultaneously132,133. Similar approaches involve the use of CARs with scFvs that recognize a fluorescein isothiocyanate fluorophore conjugated to TAA-binding molecules in order to target multiple antigens simultaneously134\u2013137. Likewise, CARs that incorporate Fc\u03b3Rs as the antigen-binding domain enable the use of therapeutic TAA-binding antibodies to target multiple antigens with a single CAR molecule138. In the SUPRA (split, universal and programmable) CAR system139, leucine zipper motifs are used to match CARs (zipCAR) with free scFvs (zipFv), again enabling simultaneous targeting of multiple antigens as well as the inclusion of multiple antigen logic gates and attenuation of CAR T cell activation (the CAR T cells are only active when zipFv are present). These and other technologies might provide a means to successfully target heterogeneous solid tumours in patients while minimizing off-tumour toxicities.",

In patients, CAR T cells have been infused directly to tumours at various anatomical sites, including the brain27, breast102, pleura140 and liver141,142, in order to avoid the requirement for recruitment from the blood, with some promising responses observed. Local infusion of CAR T cells might also limit on-target, off-tumour toxicities143. This general approach might be limited to single tumour lesions or oligometastatic disease and might be more resource intensive than more established local therapies; however, locally delivered CAR T cells have the potential to expand and traffic to other tumour sites and to promote responses of endogenous immune cells against tumours. Indeed, in two patients who received infusions of T cells transduced with mRNA encoding an anti-mesothelin CAR, one of whom received both intravenous and regional infusions, evidence of an evoked antitumour humoral response involving multiple additional antigens was detected140. Similar results have not yet been widely reported in studies involving the intratumoural delivery of CAR T cells, but this result illustrates the potential to use localized delivery to initiate systemic antitumour immune responses. Nevertheless, many metastatic solid tumours are not amenable to localized therapy and thus efforts to engineer CAR T cells with an intrinsic ability to traffic to sites of disease are underway.",

Similarly, forced expression of CCR2b, which is the receptor for CCL2 (a chemokine overexpressed in multiple types of solid tumours), increased the infiltration of anti-GD2 CAR T cells into neuroblastoma xenograft tumours by more than tenfold147 and anti-mesothelin CAR T cell infiltration into mesothelioma xenografts by more than 12-fold, with associated increases in antitumour activity148.",

In one study, FAP-targeted CAR T cells caused cachexia and bone toxicity via effects on FAP+ stromal cells in the bone marrow and had limited effects on the progression of various tumour types in immunocompetent mice149. However, in another study using immunocompetent mouse models, FAP-targeted CAR T cells with a different anti-FAP scFv decreased tumour growth when administered in combination with a vaccine, without severe toxicities150.

Anti-GD2 CAR T cells engineered to degrade heparin sulfate proteoglycans in the ECM through expression of heparinase had an improved capacity to infiltrate xenograft tumours in mice and prolonged survival as compared with CAR T cells lacking heparinase expression151. Other ECM-degrading enzymes are also under exploration for a role in CAR T cell therapy152. Caution is warranted, however, following the observation that addition of the pegylated form of the ECM-degrading enzyme hyaluronidase (PEGPH20) to chemotherapy decreased the overall survival of patients with pancreatic adenocarcinoma in one trial153, although this effect was not seen in a second trial using a different chemotherapy regimen154. Of note, patients who received PEGPH20 in these trials required low molecular weight heparin supplementation to compensate for an increased risk of thromboembolic events, presenting the possibility that T cells engineered to modify the ECM might also increase the risk of such events. Thus, while ECM modification is an exciting frontier in CAR T cell therapy for solid tumours, caution is warranted given the complicated and currently unpredictable effects of ECM-modifying enzymes.",

While multiple inhibitory signals can be present in the TME, the best characterized pathway involves PD-1. PD-1 is an immune-checkpoint receptor expressed on activated T cells and, when bound by PD-L1, which can be expressed by tumour cells as well as other cell types, induces T cells to adopt an exhausted, ineffective phenotype. Inhibition of the PD-1 pathway can result in dramatic clinical benefit in patients with certain types of cancer155. Notably, expression of PD-1 and other inhibitory receptors has been demonstrated to be a mechanism of CAR T cell dysfunction156, and numerous groups have demonstrated increased efficacy of CAR T cell therapy with coadministration of antibodies that inhibit the PD-1 pathway in preclinical models157 and in subsets of patients with ALL158 or diffuse large B cell lymphoma159. Similarly, dramatic antitumour responses have been observed in a subset of patients who received anti-PD-1 antibodies following mesothelin-targeted CAR T cell therapy160.",

            "text": "Rather than use CAR T cells in combination with established immune-checkpoint inhibitors, researchers have demonstrated successful strategies to genetically engineer disruption of the PD-1 pathway into CAR T cells themselves (Fig. 4Da). For example, anti-mesothelin CAR T cells transduced with a truncated, dominant-negative PD-1 receptor lacking intracellular signalling domains, which is able to bind to PD-L1 but is incapable of conveying inhibitory signals, resist PD-L1-induced exhaustion and prolong survival in mice bearing xenograft pleural mesotheliomas as compared with CAR T cells lacking this decoy receptor161. An alternative approach involves PD-1 switch receptors, in which the extracellular domain of PD-1 is fused to the transmembrane and intracellular signalling domain of CD28. Accordingly, these switch receptors transduce an activating co-stimulatory signal when stimulated by PD-L1 as well as acting as dominant-negative inhibitors of immunosuppressive signalling via endogenous PD-1 molecules in T cells162\u2013164 or CAR T cells165 used for adoptive cell therapy, thereby enhancing efficacy in various preclinical models. CAR T cells have also been engineered to secrete antagonistic IgG1 antibodies that can bind to PD-L1 on tumour cells and antigen-presenting cells, which prevents T cell exhaustion and recruits NK cells that can mediate antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity to tumours, as demonstrated in a mouse xenograft model of renal cell carcinoma166. Similarly, CAR T cells engineered to secrete antagonistic anti-PD-1 scFvs have enhanced functionality and prolong survival in xenograft167,168 and immunocompetent syngeneic mouse models of PD-L1+ haematological or solid cancers167. Notably, these scFvs can also bind to and prevent suppression of endogenous bystander T cells in the TME167, demonstrating the potential for combining CAR T cell technologies with immune-checkpoint inhibition as a means of both enhancing CAR T cell function and enlisting endogenous antitumour T cell populations.",

For example, arginine has important roles in T cell function181, and competition with cancer cells and other cells of the TME for this amino acid might result in suppression of the antitumour activity of T cells. Accordingly, pre-treatment of TCR-transgenic T cells with arginine in vitro increased the antitumour activity of these cells after infusion into mice with melanomas expressing the cognate antigen181. Intriguingly, elevated potassium levels in the TME have been shown to influence nutrient uptake by T cells, resulting in metabolic shifts and epigenetic changes that preserve T cell stemness and inhibit the differentiation of these cells towards effector phenotypes182. Correspondingly, in vitro pre-treatment with potassium increases the persistence and antitumour activity of adoptively transferred human T cells in mouse xenograft models182. In another example of modification of T cell metabolism to overcome aspects of the metabolically hostile TME, expression of the antioxidant enzyme catalase enables T cells to overcome granulocyte-mediated oxidative stress in vitro183. As these examples illustrate, modifying and engineering T cell metabolic pathways might provide new opportunities to increase the efficacy of CAR T cells in patients with solid tumours.",

Regardless of the number of TAAs targeted, antigen escape is always a concern with CAR T cell therapy and thus recruitment of endogenous immune cells might be necessary to propagate the antitumour immune response. Augmenting CAR T cells to secrete stimulatory cytokines that not only foster the proliferation, survival and antitumour activity of T cells but also alter the immune milieu of solid tumours is an area of active investigation. Indeed, numerous cytokines have been explored to create such forms of armoured CAR T cells (Fig. 4Db), which are also known as T cells redirected for universal cytokine killing (TRUCKs)184.",

IL-12 has a multifaceted role in the immune response, including activation of both T cells and NK cells. Subsequently, genetic modification of CAR T cells to express IL-12 resulted in increased cytotoxicity and resistance to Treg cell-mediated inhibition in vitro, better engraftment without preconditioning chemotherapy and enhanced antitumour activity in vivo185. IL-12 expression also resulted in dramatic CAR T cell expansion from limited numbers of cells isolated from umbilical cord blood samples, introducing the possibility of generating CAR T cells from small volumes of cord blood for patients with haematological malignancies undergoing allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT)115. In a subsequent study186, IL-12-secreting CAR T cells targeting MUC16ecto, which is the membrane-retained portion of the serum cancer biomarker mucin-16 (CA-125), were subsequently shown to have increased antitumour activity in xenograft or immunocompetent syngeneic mouse models of ovarian cancer187. In these models, the IL-12-secreting armoured CAR T cells had an increased proliferative capacity, better survival and greater cytotoxicity than the parental, unarmoured CAR T cells and were also more resistant to apoptosis and PD-L1-induced dysfunction187. Together, these data supported the initiation of a clinical trial of MUC16ecto-targeted, IL-12-secreting CAR T cells in patients with ovarian cancer (NCT02498912)188. In mice xenografted with carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)-positive and CEA\u2013 colon cancer cell lines, IL-12-secreting, CEA-targeting CAR T cells have greater anticancer activity than their counterparts lacking IL-12 secretion through promotion of macrophage-mediated killing of the antigen-negative tumour cells189. Similarly, IL-12-secreting CARs targeting VEGFR2 have increased efficacy in multiple mouse models of well-vascularized solid cancers190. In these models, CAR T cells also altered the immunosuppressive TME by targeting VEGFR2-expressing myeloid-derived suppressor cells; however, the overall antitumour effect was dependent on the expression of the IL-12 receptor on host cells other than T cells and B cells190. Notably, lethal toxicity has been observed in clinical trials with systemic IL-12 infusions191, and life-threatening haemodynamic instability was observed in a clinical trial of IL-12-secreting tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes192; however, expression of IL-12 by CAR T cells via different gene-expression cassettes, for example, from internal ribosome entry sites or promoters with inducible nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) binding motifs, can result in lower levels of IL-12 production193,194. Thus, preclinical results have demonstrated the therapeutic promise of IL-12-secreting CAR T cells, although drastic dose-dependent variability in immune responses and toxicities are concerns that must be considered in ongoing and future clinical trials.",

In comparison with unarmoured anti-CD19 CAR T cells, the expansion and antitumour activity of armoured CAR T cells expressing IL-15 were increased, with decreased apoptosis and PD-1 expression, in mouse xenograft models of Burkitt lymphoma and in patient-derived B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) samples in vitro195. Secretion of IL-15 by anti-IL-13R\u03b12 CAR T cells and by anti-GD2 CAR T cells has subsequently been shown to increase the survival of mice bearing orthotopic glioma xenografts196 and metastatic neuroblastoma xenografts197, respectively. In a mouse xenograft model of leukaemia, a modified form of IL-15 tethered to the cell membrane of CAR T cells enhanced the anticancer activity and persistence of these cells, engendering them with a memory-like phenotype, and prevented disease relapse198. Moreover, fusion of the IL-15 receptor signalling domain to the CD28 co-stimulatory signalling domain of an anti-CD19 CAR resulted in the generation of CAR T cells with enhanced in vivo persistence in preclinical models and induced complete remission in one patient with ALL199. Thus, IL-15 can enhance the persistence and activity of CAR T cells in vivo, although limited evidence of the effects on the TME in immunocompetent models is available for this cytokine. Additionally, concerning exogenous cytokine-independent in vitro clonal expansion has been observed following transduction of mature human lymphocytes to express IL-15, suggesting a potentially dangerous autocrine loop200. Moreover, mice with near-ubiquitous overexpression of IL-15 develop leukaemia with a T cell or NK cell phenotype201. Clinically, toxicities, such as hypotension, thrombocytopenia and elevations in serum aspartate transaminase and/or alanine transaminase levels, have been observed with systemic administration of IL-15 (ref.202). Given that the half-life of the recombinant IL-15 used in this trial was <3 hours, IL-15 produced continuously by CAR T cells might have different pharmacokinetic and toxicity profiles. Nevertheless, engineering strategies using nanogels to \u2018backpack\u2019 large quantities of IL-15 onto CAR T cells have revealed that high doses of IL-15 can be delivered to tumour sites without systemic toxicities, at least in preclinical models203.",

This personalized approach to anticancer therapy has been associated with remarkable successes in the clinic, although generating CAR T cells in this way limits the number of patients who can benefit from this therapy, for several reasons. First, harvesting sufficient numbers of T cells from patients with cancer can be difficult, as many patients are lymphopenic as a sequalae of the disease or previous chemotherapy. In paediatric patients, chemotherapy also decreases the percentage of naive T cells in peripheral blood, which are important for the clinical activity of CAR T cells214, and low levels of this T cell subset can lead to production failure215. Second, autologous CAR T cell products have a lengthy and individualized manufacturing process that might not be feasible for patients with advanced-stage cancer, in whom the disease might progress during manufacturing4,5. Finally, failure of CAR T cell production can also be attributable to the characteristics of the apheresis product216. For example, disease-related dysfunctions of T cells217, such as those described in patients with CLL218,219 or solid tumours220, can result in unsuccessful manufacturing or inferior products that lead to poor response rates in patients.",

In patients with haematological malignancies, HSCT is commonly performed, and CAR T cells produced from the original human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-matched allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell donors have been used. Indeed, the treatment of patients with persistent B cell malignancies following allogeneic HSCT using donor-derived leukocytes expressing CD19-directed CARs has led to complete and partial remissions221\u2013223. GVHD has developed in a subset of patients in a few of these studies222,223, although some of these events might have been attributable to prior treatment, and allogeneic CAR T cell therapy has been associated with a lower rate of GVHD than that expected with traditional donor lymphocyte infusion. The CAR constructs used in these studies had a CD28 co-stimulatory domain, and findings in preclinical models have suggested that CARs with a 4-1BB co-stimulatory domain are associated with a greater risk of GVHD than those with a CD28 co-stimulatory domain224. Partially HLA-matched donor-derived viral antigen-specific T cells are a second potential source of allogeneic T cells for transduction with CAR constructs50. These CAR T cells lack alloreactive potential because the TCR is virus specific and reportedly have promising activity in patients with relapsed B cell leukaemia after allogeneic HSCT225.",

Deletion of the \u03b1 chain through targeted disruption of the TRAC locus has been the most common GVHD-avoidance strategy to date228. The \u03b2 chain is encoded by two TRBC genes (TRBC1 and TRBC2) and, therefore, knocking out this subunit is potentially more complicated.

These breaks are subsequently repaired by the non-homologous end joining or homologous recombination DNA repair pathways, which can be exploited to disrupt, and thereby prevent, the expression of the target gene. CAR T cells have been modified using ZFN to eliminate the expression of the TCR \u03b1 or \u03b2 chains (and thus functional TCRs)229, or the HLA-A230 or \u03b22 microglobulin (\u03b22M)231 subunits of MHC I; these CAR T cells did not cause GVHD in preclinical models. Transcription activator-like (TAL) effector nuclease (TALEN) technologies have also been used to knockout the TCR232, and TALEN-edited anti-CD19 CAR T cells have induced remissions in infants with B cell ALL, with no GVHD observed233. Fusion proteins comprising a meganuclease conjugated with a TAL repeat DNA recognition domain (termed megaTAL) have also been used to disrupt \u03b1\u03b2TCR228. However, these gene-editing methods require the design of specific pairs of nucleases, which has limited the widespread use of these systems. Alternatively, the CRISPR\u2013Cas9 platform has been used to prevent the expression of the TCR \u03b1 chain234,235 or a combination of the TCR \u03b1 and \u03b2 chains, \u03b22M and PD-1 (refs231,236) in CAR T cells. Deletion of \u03b1\u03b2TCR and \u03b22M has also been successfully achieved using a combination of the CRISPR\u2013Cas9 and TALEN platforms, termed Cas-Clover237. Insertion of the CAR gene construct into the TRAC locus has also been achieved using CRISPR\u2013Cas9 in preclinical models, thereby knocking out the TCR and inserting the CAR in one step238; this feat has also been achieved using an engineered I-CreI homing endonuclease and an adeno-associated virus donor template239. These approaches have the dual advantage of eliminating the endogenous TCR, thereby reducing the risk of GVHD and thus facilitating the use of allogeneic CAR T cells, whilst simultaneously enhancing CAR T cell function by reducing tonic signalling and ensuring uniform cell-surface levels of CAR expression as well as efficient recycling of internalized CARs back to the cell surface.",

Naive T cells have been generated from haematopoietic stem cells present in donor bone marrow or cord blood samples, embryonic stem cells or induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells through culturing with stromal cells and Notch ligands, commonly the OP9 mouse bone marrow stromal cell line and Delta-like ligand 1 (DLL1) or DLL4 (ref.242). Preclinical studies with CAR-expressing T cell precursors have demonstrated in vivo maturation of these T cells, with no GVHD observed243,244. Importantly, donor T cells that have been reprogrammed to restore pluripotency and create CAR iPS cells are capable of self-renewal and can be banked245. Indeed, a single cell-derived CAR iPS master cell line, FT819, has been created by dedifferentiating peripheral T cells into iPS cells followed by biallelic disruption of the TRAC locus with the CAR gene246,247. This strategy has resulted in a well-defined, expandable cell product derived from a single source with no native TCR and with expression of the CAR under transcriptional control of the TRAC endogenous regulatory elements.",

Indeed, transformation of T cells into malignant clones, owing to insertional mutagenesis involving either activation of endogenous proto-oncogenes by viral promoters or disruption of tumour-suppressor genes, is a well-anticipated theoretical risk of any gene therapy. Such transformation through insertional mutagenesis has not been described in patients to date, although viral insertion into genes has been observed clinically in lentivirally transduced CAR T cells used in the treatment of a patient with CLL248. Specifically, the CAR gene was inserted into the TET2 loci and led to a clonal expansion of T cells248; this clonal T cell population eventually contracted spontaneously, but this event highlights the risk of treating patients with genetically modified cells. As experience with adoptive cell transfer accumulates, however, researchers are becoming more comfortable with this risk, and a first-in-human trial has been initiated to evaluate an NY-ESO-1-directed transgenic TCR T cell product with multiple CRISPR\u2013Cas9 gene edits to remove endogenous TCR and PD-1 (NCT03399448).",

In preclinical and clinical studies of CAR T cells, investigators have used reference sequences from a myriad of molecules within each of these domains. The antigen-binding domain is usually a single-chain variable fragment (scFv) molecule derived from a monoclonal antibody (mAb; from mouse anti-human CD19 antibodies, for example, in the currently FDA-approved CAR T cell products). The intracellular signalling domain generally contains a T cell activation domain derived from the CD3\u03b6 chain of the T cell receptor as well as co-stimulatory domains that often comprise immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif-containing regions of CD28 or 4-1BB (also known as CD137 and TNFRSF9). CAR gene constructs can be further modified to engineer CAR T cells with expression of an \u2018armour\u2019 protein, which is typically a cell-surface or secreted immunomodulatory molecule that enhances T cell function or favourably modifies the tumour microenvironment. Variation of each of these component parts of CAR constructs enables fine tuning of the functionality and antitumour activity of the resultant CAR T cell product, and CARs with various designs are being developed to improve the safety and efficacy of these therapies across various cancers.
