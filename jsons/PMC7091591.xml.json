            "text": "Complement activation is a physiological defense mechanism which induces rapid destruction and phagocytosis of inoculated microbes and foreign bodies. Complement activation can occur by antigen\u2013antibody complexes (classical pathway) and directly after plasma contact with a number of microbial components or foreign surface (alternative pathway).34 The majority of adults carry antibodies against adenoviral hexon group antigens56 due to previous adenoviral infections. The direct inoculation of viral particles into the circulation in such individuals will usually induce the formation of antigen\u2013antibody complexes and subsequently complement activation. Factors influencing the number of antigen\u2013antibody complexes will depend on the route of administration (systemic or local), the virus dose, the amount and type of pre-existing antibodies and the activity of regulatory proteins. During the early phase of complement activation, the anaphylatoxins C3a and C5a are generated. These mediators induce a broad variety of inflammatory reactions, such as IL-1 and TNF release,789 activation of neutrophilic granulocytes and macrophages,10 contraction of pulmonary vasculature,11 changes in vascular permeability,12 and platelet aggregation.13 Systemic activation of the complement system, as known from patients suffering from sepsis, severe burns or injuries, could induce autodestructive inflammatory reactions, such as adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or multiple organ failure (MOF).1415161718 Both types of clinical symptom complexes have been observed in the patient who died during the OTCD trial, which suggests an involvement of the complement system. In this article, we will discuss prophylactic measures which might help to control or avoid excess activation of the complement system after adenoviral gene therapy in humans.",

Reaction was stopped after 90 min by addition of 1/10 vol 0.1 M EDTA and C3a-desArg levels were determined by ELISA (Figure 1).

After challenging plasma (blood) samples with 5 \u00d7 107 and 5 \u00d7 108 particles/ml, a moderate generation of C3a-desArg (180\u2013430 ng/ml and 460\u2013700 ng/ml, baseline <140 ng/ml) was determined, while a substantial further increase in complement activation was measured after incubation with 5 \u00d7 109 and 5 \u00d7 1010 particles (2300\u20134900 ng/ml and 8800\u201324000 ng/ml) Figure 1. The presence of cellular components of the blood reduced the level of complement activation by about 20% (data not shown). Comparing C3a-desArg levels of plasma samples containing neutralizing antibodies and those without neutralizing antibodies revealed higher levels of activation in the first group (about 20 900 ng/ml versus 9300 ng/ml). The data show that antibody-dependent complement activation does also occur in the absence of neutralizing antibodies.",

This finding suggests a strict antibody-dependence of complement activation in human plasma. To further verify the role of pre-existing antibodies for complement activation in this system, immunoglobulin was removed from citrate plasma samples by gel filtration on protein-G sepharose. The filtration procedure itself induced some complement activation, but after removal of the immunoglobulins, the addition of virus particles no longer induced C3a release (Figure 3). After reconstitution of Ig-depleted plasma with polyvalent immunoglobulin (containing an average amount of neutralizing anti-Ad antibodies at a titer of 1/256) to a concentration of 2.5 mg Ig/ml (about 20% of physiological Ig serum concentration), the previous responsiveness to adenovirus challenge was demonstrated. Complement activation via the classical pathway by adenovirus was confirmed in an additional experimental system. Plasma samples were incubated with adenoviruses in the presence of EGTA. The calcium-binding capacity of EGTA blocks the antibody-dependent classical pathway of complement activation, whereas the alternative pathway remains unaffected, thus allowing differentiation of both pathways. EGTA blocked the virus-induced complement activation completely Figure 3. These findings reveal that the alternative, ie antibody-independent pathway of complement activation after challenge with adenoviruses, is not relevant in human plasma.",

Before virus application, the level of all anti-adenoviral antibodies should be determined. Measuring only the titer of neutralizing antibodies provides no information about the total amount of relevant, ie complement-activating antibodies. The individual differences in complement reactivity against adenoviruses (up to a factor of 5) will make it difficult to define a dose threshold which would reliably exclude uncontrolled complement activation. It might be more appropriate to define an individual threshold performing in vitro complement studies with patients\u2019 plasma before gene therapy, in a kind of bedside test to predict the amount of in vivo activation to be expected. Patients showing a strong in vitro reactivity could benefit from appropriate pharmacological measures. Prophylactic steroid treatment will have no influence on the extent of complement activation, but steroids are known to reduce subsequent inflammatory reactions, like cytokine release and macrophage activation.2324 C1-esterase inhibitors have been proven for many years to be beneficial for the treatment of hereditary angioedema. They are currently tested as a protective measure against complement-mediated inflammatory tissue damage252627 and would help to avoid or reduce adenovirus-induced complement activation.",
