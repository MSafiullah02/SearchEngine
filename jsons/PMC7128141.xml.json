Despite preclinical demonstration of protection by GLS-5300 against radiological and histopathological pneumonia after MERS coronavirus challenge in rhesus macaques,10 it remains difficult to interpret the relevance of the immunogenicity parameters that were assessed in humans in the phase 1 trial given our poor understanding of protective natural immune responses. Modjarrad and colleagues sought to bridge this gap in a post-hoc analysis by obtaining samples from ten individuals who had recovered from natural MERS coronavirus infection during the 2015 outbreak in South Korea (convalescent serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cell samples were obtained at a mean of 19\u00b78 months [SD 0\u00b77] after the original MERS diagnosis). Anti-S1 and neutralising antibody titres following natural infection were significantly higher than vaccine-induced responses in the acute phase, but were not different to vaccine in late convalescent samples and at similar post-vaccination timepoints.",

Despite many challenges for development, the platform technologies on which vaccines such as GLS-5300 are based hold promise against novel pathogen threats because of the rapidity with which they can be formulated and manufactured; four MERS coronavirus vaccine candidates that have started phase 1 trials are based on different platform technologies.6 Completion of the phase 1 trial of GLS-5300 represents an incremental but important step in the development of vaccines against emerging viral global threats.",
