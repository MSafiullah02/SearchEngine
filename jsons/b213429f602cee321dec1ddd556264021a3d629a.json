Unreported results from HI tests performed in our laboratory on sera collected from the general population in 1963-1965 also confirm these general findings.

Other studies have also noted the heterogeneity of antibody responses with known or presumed coronavirus infection. Mclntosh (12) reports that fourfold or greater HI antibody rises to OC 43 were found among 14 per cent of 70 paired sera obtained from volunteers before and after infection with coronaviruses other than OC 43. Extension of these observations of heterotypic rises to yet unknown strains cannot be excluded. The absence of data on isolation of coronaviruses during our study places severe restrictions on assigning OC 43 as the sole etiologic agent.

The frequency of preexisting antibody among subjects with seroconversions was essentially the same for groups reporting or not reporting illness. Only seven of the 31 cases with preexisting antibody had titers of 1:20 or greater. Comparison of HI and CF tests. HI and CF test results were compared on 44 paired sera from children showing seroconversion to coronavirus strain OC 43 (table 4). Of 44 paired sera, 28 (64 per cent) showed fourfold or greater rises by CF compared with 100 per cent by HI. Thus, 16 cases of illness (36 per cent) would have gone undetected if only the CF test had been used. The reciprocal GMT for acute and convalescent sera for the HI test was <10 and 56 as compared with <8 and 19 for the CF test. Clinical syndrome. Complete clinical histories were available for 43 of 44 children. The major presenting complaints of the 43 children with respiratory illness and HI seroconversion to strain OC 43 were sore throat (30 per cent), cough (30 per cent), coryza (19 per cent), and fever (9 per cent) (table 5).

Other types isolated from organ culture had an indefinite relationship with MHV and OC 38 and OC 43 strains. Kaye and Dowdle (5) have also shown a relationship between OC 38 and/or OC 43 strains and MHV by CF and HI tests. Antibodies to MHV in human sera from patients with respiratory illness have been demonstrated by Hartley et al. (11). Mclntosh et al. (10), in a seroepidemiologic study of coronavirus infection in children, found a moderate overlap of antibody response (35-45 per cent) occurring between MHV and OC 38 and/or OC 43.
