Very little research exists on the effects of social distancing measures on this pandemic. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of government implemented social distancing measures on the cumulative incidence rates of COVID-19 in the United States on a state level, and in the 25 most populated cities, while adjusting for socio-demographic risk factors. The social distancing variables assessed in this study were: days to closing of non-essential business; days to stay home orders; days to restrictions on gathering, days to restaurant closings and days to school closing. Using negative binomial regression, adjusted rate ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated comparing two levels of a binary variable: \"above median value,\" and \"median value and below\" for days to implementing a social distancing measure. For city level data, the effects of these social distancing variables were also assessed in high (above median value) vs low (median value and below) population density cities. For the state level analysis, days to school closing was associated with cumulative incidence, with an adjusted rate ratio of 1.59 (95% CI:1.03,2.44), p=0.04 at 35 days. Some results were counterintuitive, including inverse associations between cumulative incidence and days to closure of non-essential business and restrictions on gatherings. This finding is likely due to reverse causality, where locations with slower growth rates initially chose not to implement measures, and later implemented measures when they absolutely needed to respond to increasing rates of infection. Effects of social distancing measures seemed to vary by population density in cities. Our results suggest that the effect of social distancing measures may differ between states and cities and between locations with different population densities. States and cities need individual approaches to containment of an epidemic, with an awareness of their own structure in terms of crowding and socio-economic variables. In an effort to reduce infection rates, cities may want to implement social distancing in advance of state mandates.",

Because the spread of the virus is largely contingent upon proximity to one another, common containment measures included attempts to create physical distance (e.g. public health measures such as restrictions on gatherings) (9) . As the U.S. scrambled to establish containment measures, states and local governments laid out vastly heterogeneous rules on how individuals would prevent close contact (10, 11) .",

A report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention examined data from the metropolitan areas of San Francisco, Seattle, New Orleans and NYC in terms of the timing of policy measures, community mobility, and incidence rates. They found that the percentage of residents leaving home declined as the number of policies issued increased, with data trends suggested that social distancing measures may decrease incidence rates. The analysis was limited by lack of information on confounders (e.g. age, gender, and race) and limited data on mobile phone coverage (12) . Another recent publication looked at the impact of several social distancing measures on the growth rate of confirmed COVID-19 cases using county level data across the U.S. They reported that government-imposed social distancing measures reduced the daily growth rate by 5.4 % after 1-5 days, 6.8 % after 6-10 days, 8.2% after 11-15 days, and 9.1% after 16-20 days, and suggested that failure to enact these types of restrictions would fuel exponential spread (13) . Though there are not many published studies on the effects of social distancing on COVID-19, social distancing measures associated with other epidemics for Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak and Ebola virus disease have been reported, but comparisons are difficult because those viruses frequently affected a different demographic (children) than COVID-19 (14, 15) .",

One study modeled the effects of social distancing measures on the progression of the COVID-19 epidemic in Wuhan, China, which showed that physical distancing measures may be most effective if delayed rather than done as a sudden lifting of interventions. However, they noted that results varied by the duration of infectiousness and the role of school children in the epidemic (16) . Another group created a model to study the impact of social distancing and school closure on viral transmission while accounting for age differences. They reported that social distancing in China during their outbreak was sufficient to control COVID-19, with a 40-60% reduction in peak incidence with proactive school closures (17) . A recent mathematical model used to investigate the effectiveness of social distancing interventions in a mid-sized U.S. city (modeled after Seattle) showed that interventions that start earlier in the epidemic delay the epidemic curve while interventions initiated later flatten the epidemic curve (18) .",

Table 2 shows the differences between states that took above median vs median and below number of days to implementing different social distancing measures. Adjustment for days for preparation, population density percentage of total population represented by urban population, percent female, 65 and over and percent Black/African American resulted in the best model fit. Days to closure of non-essential businesses was inversely associated with cumulative incidence, with rate ratios consistently between 0.49 to 0.66. Days to restrictions on gatherings was also inversely associated with cumulative incidence, with rate ratios between 0.48 to 0.64, but after adjustment, none of these associations remained statistically significant. Days to school closing was associated with cumulative incidence on day 35 and 42, with an adjusted rate ratio of 1.59 (95% CI:1.03,2.44), p=0.04 at 35 days, and adjusted rate ratio of 1.64 (95% CI:1.07,2.52), p=0.04 at 42 days. Sensitivity analysis with omission of states that may skew results did not alter results. Table 3 shows the differences between cities that took above median vs median and below number of days to implementing different social distancing measures. The best model fit included adjustment for percent of Black/African American individuals in a city. Days to closure of non-essential businesses was inversely associated with cumulative incidence at days 28, and 42, with adjusted rate ratios of 0.64 and 0.63, respectively. Increased days to restrictions on gatherings was statistically significant (rate ratio=2.17 (95% CI: 1.14,4.12) p=0.02), but after adjustment for the percent black individuals in a city, the result was no longer statistically significant (rate ratio=0.97 (0.60,1.56) p=0.90). Population density was consistently associated with increased cumulative risk at all time points, with an adjusted rate ratio of 2.35 (95% CI: 1.50, 3.65) p=0.0002) at 42 days. Table 4 displays the statistically significant results for both ANOVA and Kruskal-Wallis tests when evaluating cumulative incidence at day 35, looking at the combined effects of various factors and population density.

Ultimately, the success of government mandates will be affected by human behavior. All rights reserved. No reuse allowed without permission.",

Given the immense toll the pandemic has taken on human lives in nearly every location in the U.S., all locations must take basic infection control precautions as well as social distancing measures. Areas of high risk must implement localized measures that go beyond broader state measures. While the scientific community acknowledges that there is not a single data source that will guide the pandemic response, this study demonstrates that relying solely on health services data (i.e., number of hospitalizations, tests completed, deaths, etc.) has its limitations. Government officials should be conducting robust evaluations of community mitigation strategies such as physical distancing at the state and local levels. Including an evaluation of these measures to guide reopening efforts will give officials a more holistic sense of community health and wellbeing.",

The pandemic response workforce should be trained in cultural humility, health literacy, community engagement and outreach, addressing implicit bias, and ensuring all protocols and quality improvement initiatives are systematically implemented and evaluated. Finally, a failure to follow recommended infection control strategies will likely result in a similar result with a second pandemic wave regardless of a second round of government implemented social distancing measures.",
