For use in the experiments, the cells were split once they reached 90% confluence and seeded onto 6- or 24-well tissue culture plate inserts. The culture medium was changed to 2% FBS containing DMEM before virus infection. In the present study, we used SARS-CoV (Drosten et al., 2003), which was isolated as Frankfurt 1 (Thiel et al., 2003) and kindly provided by Dr. J. Ziebuhr. Infection was usually performed with a multiplicity of infection (moi) of 5.",
