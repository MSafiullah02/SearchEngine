Little is known of their travel health seeking behaviours. China is the biggest source of international students studying in Australia and the unprecedented epidemic of COVID-19 in China makes this an important area of research. Methods: Focus groups of Chinese international students were conducted to explore travel health-related knowledge, attitudes and practices. Eligible participants were studying in Sydney, and had travelled to China and Hong Kong to visit friends and relatives in the preceding 18 months. A variety of topics were explored, using a focus group guide. Thematic analysis was undertaken on the transcripts using nVivo software. The list of codes and themes were not predetermined but developed through content analysis. Results: Two focus groups were held with a total of 28 participants. Risk perception about VFR travel was generally low among Chinese international students. Pre-travel healthcare was not sought. Students strongly relied on the Internet, social media, parents and friends in China for travel health advice. Conclusion: This research provides insights into Chinese international students as VFR travellers. It confirms students could be a risk population for importations of infections such as COVID-19 because of low risk perception and lack of seeking travel health advice. This can inform health promotion strategies for students. \u00aa",

By late February, multiple countries had developed large-scale local epidemics, causing international concern of a potential pandemic [4] . In response, the Australian government introduced a travel restriction, denying entry to all foreign nationals who had been in China within 14 days of arrival [5] . In Australia, where there is a sizeable Chinese international student population [6] , the travel ban prevented nearly 100,000 students travelling to Australia to commence or continue their studies [7e9] . This decision remains controversial among a wide range of stakeholders, and is subject to continued review by the government [8e10], including phased lifting of the ban such as exempting international high school students in March 2020. At the heart of the conversation is whether the return of Chinese international students poses an epidemic risk for Australia, and whether this risk can be mitigated.",

Previous studies have suggested that university-aged travellers are generally at a higher risk of travel-related illness than older travellers [11, 12] . Travellers of this age group commonly have low risk perceptions regarding travel-related infectious risks, and hence often undertake inadequate travel health preparation before and during travel. Previous studies have shown that younger travellers are more willing to take health risks [13, 14] , for example, eating street food while travelling [13] , less likely to comply with travel-related preventive measures, for example, taking antimalarial chemoprophylaxis [13] , and less willing to cancel air travel if unwell during outbreaks [15] . An online cross-sectional study of Australian university students in 2010 found that students generally had low risk perception across a wide range of potential health threats, including respiratory infections, vector-transmitted illnesses, food poisoning, and other infectious and non-infectious risks [16] . The study also found that international students were less likely than domestic students to have undertaken adequate preparations for travel in a wide variety of areas, including obtaining travel health insurance, bringing medication, first aid kits or insect repellents for use while travelling, and undertaking food and water avoidance measures during travel [16] . Similar to other travellers visiting friends and relatives (VFR), international students have also been shown to have low uptake of pre-travel health advice [16] .",

More serious infections may also be carried by international students, and potentially spread to other students. The diagnosis of polio in a returned Pakistani international student in Melbourne in 2007 highlighted this risk [23, 24] and half of reported cases of multi-drug resistant tuberculosis in Victoria, Australia, during the 10 years up to 2007 in international students [25] .",

A study of Australian travellers found that 'country of origin or staying with family' and 'advised by friends or others it was safe' were commonly reported reasons for not seeking professional pre-travel health advice [45] . It appears that advice from relatives may be both helpful, for example, advice about current outbreaks in China, and counterproductive, for example, advice not to take a vaccine based on unjustified reasons.

Although other Chinese VFR travellers may also choose this time for travelling, international students are especially likely to do so, given that it is also the time of the annual vacation for Australian universities. This is consistent with the current situation, where nearly 100,000 Chinese international students who had travelled to China during the vacation are now unable to return to Australia due to the COVID-19 related travel restrictions [7e9]. Importantly, this period is also the peak period for seasonal influenza in many parts of China [52e54]. Therefore, it would be particularly important for people travelling during this period to be vaccinated for seasonal influenza prior to their travel, and be aware of ways they can reduce their risk of getting influenza during their trip. One major barrier to this is that the northern hemisphere influenza vaccine is not licensed for use, and is therefore not available, in Australia. The WHO releases semiannual recommendations for influenza vaccine formulations, in preparation for the peak influenza seasons in the northern and the southern hemispheres respectively. The composition of annual vaccinations patients receive prior to the peak season in each hemisphere are therefore based on information only 8 months old [55] . If Chinese VFR Travel health and Chinese international students travellers travel to China in December or January and obtain influenza vaccination in Australia before they travel, they would still be receiving the southern hemisphere vaccine for the previous season. The vaccine formulation would be based on information that is more than 1 year old and less up to date than if they were immunised using the current northern hemisphere vaccine. This situation can be improved if the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration were to license the use of the northern hemisphere vaccine for use in travellers, and suppliers are willing to supply this vaccine to Australia. This is the first published study of travel health knowledge, attitudes and practices of Chinese international students as VFR travellers. Although the study population was drawn from only one university, UNSW is a major university and representative of an urban Australian university with a substantial international student community. However, students studying at regional universities may face different issues. The qualitative methodology used enabled the exploration of issues in depth. However, we were unable to quantify the proportion of participants who held particular views. This study was not conducted during a pandemic situation like COVID-19. However, there was a then-current H7N9 influenza outbreak in many parts of China [56] , and outbreak concerns were highly relevant for participants in that context. Furthermore, it is important for students to be well prepared for the risks of VFR travel at all times, since an outbreak can arise quickly and unexpectedly. Despite the aforementioned limitations, this study reports findings, which are useful in informing national or community communication strategies and other interventions to improve travel-health outcomes for Chinese international students. This is now particularly important, as the COVID-19 pandemic continues to unfold in potentially unexpected ways.",

Familiarity was again an important reason why participants did not seek professional pre-travel medical advice.You grew up in China and you're familiar with all the environment, and you can adapt to changing circumstances. So you don't feel unsafe because you grew up there. (Participant 508)The internet was a particularly common source of travel information including the use of social media in China, such as Weibo (the Chinese version of Twitter), and online Chinese news websites to source information. The internet was used both for searching for information and for communicating with family and friends in China about their need for specific preparations prior to travel.I think the first source is the internet, 'cause information is shared through the internet, and everyone go to internet and we can talk with friends and talk about what they think about if we go back to China. (Participant 502)Family and friends in China are also major sources of information. Relatives may even provide unsolicited advice, including influencing changes to travel plans in the event of infectious disease outbreaks.Most time I go to the internet, and I call my family just to ask the kind of situation there.(Participant 207)",
