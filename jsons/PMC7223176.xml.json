Feelings of burnout within the context of one\u2019s job may arise due to a variety of reasons including increasing perceptions of an overall lack of support/access to external resources (Hakanen et al. 2006; Huebner 1992; Schilling et al. 2018; Williams and Gersch 2004), increasing job demands (Evers et al. 2004; Hakanen et al. 2006; Ilies et al. 2015; Richards et al. 2016; Schilling et al. 2018;Williams and Gersch 2004), strained relationships with coworkers (Grayson and Alvarez 2008; Schilling et al. 2018; Zhao et al. 2018), reduced access to internal resources/perceptions of an individual\u2019s ability to do one\u2019s job and to cope with difficult situations (Alessandri et al. 2018; Butler and Constantine 2005; Skaalvik and Skaalvik 2007), and increased feelings of negativity (Bianchi and Schonfeld 2016; Szczygiel and Mikolajczak 2018).",

            "text": "Decades of research regarding the construct of job burnout conceptualize this response as including three distinct dimensions: emotional exhaustion (EE), depersonalization (DP), and a reduced sense of personal accomplishment (PA) (Maslach et al. 2001). Emotional exhaustion refers to feeling tired and/or fatigued within the context of one\u2019s work and includes feelings of being overextended and being drained of one\u2019s emotional and physical resources within the work environment. Feelings of depersonalization are characterized by a general sense of detachment from one\u2019s job and can include the adoption of callous, uncaring, or even hostile/negative attitudes toward others (i.e., colleagues and/or clients). Finally, a reduced sense of personal accomplishment is defined by feelings that one is not accomplishing anything worthwhile at work and, thus, experiences a lack of motivation to perform one\u2019s job. This conception of job burnout is represented on a validated measure of these feelings, the Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) (Maslach and Jackson 1986). Ratings of items on this measure result in an overall burnout score as well as scores for current perceptions of emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and personal accomplishment. Although individuals might experience some symptoms of burnout along each of these dimensions, the degree to which symptoms of each are experienced often varies based on the nature of one\u2019s work.",

School psychologists have consistently reported feelings of burnout most often in relation to higher levels of emotional exhaustion and lower levels of personal accomplishment as measured by the MBI. In contrast, school psychologists tend to report lower levels of depersonalization on this same measure. In a 1992 random sample of NASP members, 36% of school psychologists reported high emotional exhaustion, 28% reported low levels of personal accomplishment, and only 10% reported high levels of depersonalization on the MBI (Huebner 1992). These results were fairly consistent with MBI results from practicing school psychologists collected 4 years prior to this study in 1988 (Huberty & Huebner, 1988) and 6 years later in 1998 (Mills & Huebner 1998).",

In an examination of MBI results provided by a nationwide sample of practicing school psychologists, Boccio et al. (2016) found that more than one third of practitioners reported high levels of emotional exhaustion, 12% reported low levels of personal accomplishment, and only 5% reported high levels of depersonalization. Similarly, in a more regional survey of practitioners, Schilling et al. (2018) found that 46% of school psychologists surveyed reported high levels of emotional exhaustion, 26% reported low levels of personal accomplishment, and only 6% reported high levels of depersonalization. Taken together, these results point to the importance of identifying strategies to prevent and respond to feelings of burnout in school psychologists when they occur, with particular attention paid to alleviating levels of exhaustion and increasing a heightened sense of personal accomplishment.",

The SPSBQ was developed by the researchers to gather information concerning professional burnout from school psychology practitioners in terms of factors contributing to these feelings (responding to yes/no questions, forced choice items, Likert-type ratings, and open-ended questions). Participants responded to such areas as satisfaction with salary, psychologist-to-student ratio, and number of evaluations completed annually; whether they had experienced feelings of burnout during their careers; when they first experienced feelings of burnout; how frequently they have experienced feelings of burnout; and how they typically deal with feelings of burnout. They also were asked to rate how contributory they felt each of the following factors were to feelings of burnout in the field: educational setting, relationship with coworkers, support from state and national organizations, support from administration, recognition of work, resources, parent involvement, personal circumstances, role overload, and poor fit with training. Open-ended questions solicited participants\u2019 definition of burnout and beliefs about how school psychology training programs might mitigate the issue of burnout.",

Thematic analysis as proposed by Braun and Clarke (2006) is a method of analyzing qualitative research employing a six-step process. First, the two researchers individually read and familiarized themselves with the responses provided. Next, they independently generated codes summarizing participant responses. This step involved first highlighting overarching phrases provided by participants that stood out to the researchers as potentially interesting and then coming up with shorthand labels to describe this content. The third step involved identifying patterns present among coded responses and beginning to develop resulting themes summarizing the data. This was initially completed independently by the two raters leading to step four when themes were reviewed simultaneously by the researchers. When comparing independently identified themes, each researcher had identified 9 themes summarizing the data, which were essentially identical. Consensus achieved in this step speaks to the high level of interrater reliability obtained in this thematic analysis. Step five involved a discussion of identified themes, creating a hierarchy and renaming the final set of main and sub-themes. Finally, step six involved writing up the results of the analysis, including the identification of quotes from participants\u2019 responses supporting both main and sub-themes. While the authors recognized some sub-themes included few responses they were retained as important examples of how practitioners responded to the question within the context of larger themes. The reader may interpret accordingly. See Table 1 for an identification of initial codes as well as resulting themes and sub-themes.",

As recent research has demonstrated that practitioners in this area of the county tend to report higher rates of job burnout with up to 90% reporting some feelings of burnout during their careers (Schilling et al. 2018), it is reasonable to believe that practitioners in other areas of the country experiencing lower levels of burnout may identify other potentially useful strategies for addressing the issue. Second, it should also be emphasized that participants were only asked to identify what they believe training programs can do to address job burnout in the field. They were not asked to identify strategies that their own or other training programs have engaged in in the past which they personally experienced as effective in addressing burnout. Therefore, no judgment was placed on participants\u2019 identification of strategies related to potential effectiveness of these strategies.
