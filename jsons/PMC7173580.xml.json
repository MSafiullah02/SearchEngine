            "text": "Apes are Old World primates found in Southeast Asia and Africa. The group includes the gibbons or lesser apes (family Hylobatidae), and the great apes (family Hominidae): bonobos (pygmy chimpanzees), (common) chimpanzees, gorillas, and orangutans. Many ape species are found in zoos, including several of the 17 species of gibbons, common chimpanzees, bonobos, western lowland gorillas, and Bornean and Sumatran orangutans. In terms of diseases and pathology, the common chimpanzee is the best studied of the apes, largely due to large laboratory colonies and longstanding field studies (Gamble et al., 2004, Laurence et al., 2017, Schmidt, 1975, Terio et al., 2011). Most literature on diseases of other apes concerns zoo-housed animals; however, the literature on free-living western lowland and eastern (mountain) gorillas is expanding (Benirschke and Adams, 1980, Cousins, 1972, Cousins, 1983, Hewitt, 2005, Janssen, 1993, Janssen and Bush, 1990, Lowenstine et al., 2008, Lowenstine et al., 2016, Meehan and Lowenstine, 1994, Munson and Montali, 1990, Nutter et al., 2005a, Strong et al., 2016).",

Grossly, there may be orange/brown discoloration of the duodenal mucosa and bronze discoloration of the liver. Histologically, hemosiderin is present in tingible body macrophages in the duodenal villous lamina propria, hepatocytes (periportal to panlobular), and Kupffer cells. Susceptible species have likely evolved enhanced mucosal absorption (no mucosal blockade) to compensate for natural diets high in tannins and other phytochemicals that bind iron in the intestinal lumen. Molecular aspects of ape iron balance have not been investigated. Chronic disease (e.g., mycobacteriosis) or captive diets high in ascorbic acid and low in fiber that enhance iron absorption can lead to iron sequestration and cause or exacerbate iron overload.",

This is typically a condition of adult male gorillas and chimpanzees in their mid 20s and older, though it can occur in younger males and in females. Grossly, affected hearts often have pale streaks or patches of tan or grey myocardial discoloration that corresponds histologically to fibrosis or steatosis. Often also noted is increased cardiac mass, frequently due to left ventricular hypertrophy (Fig. 15.2\n), and less often globoid enlargement with biventricular dilation. Female gorillas, orangutans and some chimpanzees may have extensive fibrosis without left ventricular hypertrophy. Histologically, dissecting fibrosis (Fig. 15.3\n), often radiating from intrinsic coronary arteries, is seen in the myocardium of all four chambers including the trabeculae carnae and papillary muscles. Large blocks of fibrosis suggestive of myocardial infarction are infrequent. Fibrosis is seen in both hypertrophied and dilated hearts and is usually associated with little or no inflammation. When present, inflammation is centered on individual myofibers. Myofiber hypertrophy with karyomegaly (representing polyploidy) and atrophy of entrapped myofibers can occur in the same heart. The polyploid nuclei in affected hearts are often distorted as well as enlarged.",

This is reflected in the various names applied to the syndrome (fibrosing cardiomyopathy, idiopathic myocardial fibrosis, interstitial myocardial fibrosis, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and dilated cardiomyopathy). The latter two designations may apply to different stages of the same process, as dilated hearts in apes are usually heavy, indicating prior hypertrophy (Sheppard, 2011). Left ventricular hypertrophy and arteriosclerosis of intramural coronary arteries indicate that hypertension may be involved in the pathogenesis of ape myocardial fibrosis (Lowenstine et al., 2016, Miller et al., 1999, Susic and Frohlich, 2008). Factors linked to hypertension in humans may also affect adult apes. These include age-associated increased arterial stiffness, chronic inflammatory conditions, abnormal sympathetic nervous system activity, psychosocial stress, metabolic syndrome, age-associated increased salt sensitivity, and chronic renal disease. Documenting ante mortem indirect blood pressure measurement in apes is challenging. Anesthetics can alter blood pressure, and measurements without anesthesia require special training of keepers and apes and validation of equipment and techniques. Hyaline arteriosclerosis and arteriolosclerosis consisting of medial smooth muscle hypertrophy and hyalinization with thickening or splitting of the internal elastic membrane of intramural (intrinsic) arteries of the heart is the dominant vascular change in gorilla hearts (Fig. 15.4\n). It is present, but inconsistent, in chimpanzee and orangutan hearts. Systematic examination of vessels in other organs (e.g., eyes and kidney) to corroborate cardiac-related hypertensive changes (Fig. 15.5\n) are important goals in ape necropsies (Neimuth et al., 2014). Although inflammatory myopathies due to both viruses (e.g., encephalomyocarditis virus, Coxsackie virus) and protozoa (trypanosomes) do occur in apes, the preponderance of ape heart disease is not inflammatory at the time of diagnosis.",

Dissections generally begin in the ascending aorta (Debakey type II, Stanford type A) just distal to the aortic valves, or within an aortic sinus. Aortic dissection occurs with or without aneurysm. Dissections may result in a \u201cdouble-barreled aorta\u201d with blood in both the old lumen and within the mural defect (Fig. 15.6\n). Death is due to pericardial hemorrhage and tamponade, acute adventitial hemorrhage that disrupts conduction pathways, or hemothorax. Histologically, a frequent change is \u201ccystic mucinous medial degeneration\u201d characterized by disorganization or loss of the parallel orientation of elastin fibers, loss of smooth muscle cells, and accumulation of amorphous ground substance (mucopolysaccharides and glycosaminoglycans) between remaining fibers (Fig. 15.7\n). Inflammation is common in the adventitia, and the vaso vasorum sometimes exhibit arteriolosclerosis (Fig. 15.8\n). In humans, and likely apes, key risk factors are older age, hypertension, atherosclerosis, pregnancy, and genetic or acquired connective tissue disorders (e.g., Marfan\u2019s syndrome, matrix metalloprotease polymorphisms, scurvy, mineral deficiencies) (Goldfinger et al., 2014). These result in an imbalance between dynamic wear and repair mechanisms and inflammation that weakens the aortic wall.",

Atherosclerosis is more common in large elastic vessels, especially the abdominal aorta, iliac arteries, and aortic arch, than in coronary arteries. It can be detected by clinical ultrasound but is more frequently discovered after death (Baitchman et al., 2006). Grossly, atherosclerosis ranges from mild fatty streaks (also occasionally seen in wild mountain gorillas) to complex atheromas with raised ulcerated plaques and \u201chardening\u201d of the vessel (Fig. 15.9\nA). Histologically, lipid laden foam cells that accumulate in the intima are accompanied by varying degrees of fibrosis, necrosis and mineralization (Fig. 15.9b). Medial arteriosclerosis with mineralization (Monckeburg\u2019s medial calcific arteriosclerosis) is also seen. The pathogenesis of atherosclerosis has been well studied using nonhuman primates as models. It is a complex process, involving alterations in the endothelium, inflammation, dyslipidemia, and changes in the arterial intercellular matrix (Wang et al., 2012). Published lipid values for cholesterol in laboratory chimpanzees and zoo and wild gorillas and orangutans are generally high compared to norms in humans (Steinetz et al., 1996; Schmidt et al., 2005).

Factors contributing to development of osteoarthritis in humans that may also contribute in apes include obesity, sedentary lifestyle, genetics, and injury.",

Rupture of tendons or ligaments is suggestive of post traumatic arthritis. Joint capsule thickening and osteophyte production in response to joint instability can be marked. Cartilage defects in inflammatory arthritis, such as spondyloarthropathy, are more often at joint margins and there may be mineralization and osteophyte production associated with the joint capsule insertion and ligaments and tendons. In the spine, bridging spondylosis involving the margins of the annulus fibrosis can be quite severe, especially in the lumbar area. Independently, degenerative disk disease of the spine can also lead to spondylosis, as can osteoarthritis, which often affects facets as well as vertebral bodies. Another form of spinal arthritis called diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH), a condition in elderly humans, is also thought to occur in apes.",

Though monkeypox has not yet been described in bonobos, their range includes endemic areas (Inogwabini and Leader-Williams, 2012). The virus is transmitted by direct contact, ingestion, inhalation, or, possibly via arthropod vectors. Three forms of monkey poxvirus infection occur in nonhuman and human primates: (1) benign upper respiratory signs followed by cutaneous eruptions; (2) mucous membrane lesions, facial and laryngeal edema, and death due to asphyxia; and (3) bronchopneumonia. Incubation in apes is less than 10 days. Initial signs are variable but can include acute death without cutaneous eruptions; cutaneous eruptions without systemic illness; purulent nasal discharge; vesicles on the soles of the feet, back of hands, face and oral mucous membranes; and, in chimpanzees in Africa, nodular lesions on the face. (http://www.oie.int/wahis_2/public/wahid.php/Reviewreport/Review?reportid=20824). The disease can be fatal in orangutans, chimps, and gibbons with as few as 4 days from onset to death.",

Batteries of reagents are available to differentiate various poxvirus infections (https://www.cdc.gov/laboratory/specimen-submission/detail.html?CDCTestCode=CDC-10515).",

Molluscipoxvirus-like infection is reported in laboratory chimpanzees (Douglas et al., 1967). The prevalence is unknown and it is uncertain if MC in chimpanzees is due to a human or chimpanzee-specific virus. Transmission in humans is by direct contact with skin lesions and fomites or through sexual contact. The route of transmission in chimpanzees is unknown, but reported cases are all juveniles. Lesions consist of small papules with depressed centers on the face, eyelids and inguinal area that regress spontaneously in several weeks. Sebum-like material, expressed from the lesions and examined cytologically with Wright\u2019s stain, contains large, basophilic, cytoplasmic inclusion bodies. Histological lesions consist of marked focal acanthosis and hypergranulosis with both elevation and in folding of the epidermis creating a \u201ccup-shaped\u201d lesion. Huge amphophilic, finely granular cytoplasmic inclusions (molluscum bodies) expand the cytoplasm of cells and are pathognomonic (Ishikawa et al., 2015).",

Cytomegalovirus infections are usually clinically silent, but can cause serious disease in fetuses, infants and immune compromised hosts. Infection is lifelong. Recrudescence occurs due to stressors, such as other viral infections and immunosuppressive drugs. Antibodies reactive with chimpanzee CMV are present with high prevalence in captive western lowland gorillas, chimpanzees, orangutans, and gibbons, and in wild eastern gorillas (Kalter et al., 1997, Sakulwira et al., 2002, Whittier, 2010). In addition, CMVs have been detected by molecular methods in wild western chimpanzees, wild and zoo-housed western lowland gorillas and zoo-housed orangutans with evidence of cross species transmission between gorillas and chimpanzees (Leendertz et al., 2009, Seimon et al., 2015). Clinical disease and deaths are infrequent. Clinical signs of CMV infection are nonspecific including anorexia, abdominal pain or respiratory signs. Histologically, infection is characterized by the presence of \u201ccytomegalic cells\u201d with karyomegaly, amphophilic, Cowdry type A intranuclear inclusions, and ill-defined granular acidophilic intracytoplasmic inclusions, similar to lesions in other primates. Cytomegalic cells are seen in alveolar septa with interstitial pneumonia and throughout the GI tract (including salivary glands), liver, lymphoid organs, brain, eye, and adrenal glands. Lesions are frequently necrotizing and CMV is one of the few viruses associated with neutrophilic inflammation. However, in acute disseminated infection in chimpanzees, cytomegalic cells may be present without inflammation. Associated conditions include adenovirus hepatitis and ulcerative colitis (Davis et al., 1992, Tsuchiya et al., 1970).",

Clinical disease, generally self-limiting, or lesions seen on routine health exams may be associated with stressful events. Horizontal transmission occurs, possibly through wounding during social interactions. Grossly, lesions on the gums and oral mucosa of the tongue, lips and cheeks are single or multiple, pale pink, plaques or nodules with cobble-stone to villiform surfaces (Fig. 15.18\n). Histologically they are characterized by acanthosis with irregular branching rete pegs (Fig. 15.19\nA).

Although a characteristic rash, facial edema and chemosis are common in OW monkeys, none was seen in gorillas. Lung lesions are of typical bronchointerstitial pneumonia, centered on small bronchi and bronchioles with necrosis of epithelium and filling of lumena by mucus and cell debris. The lesion extends into the interstitium as acute alveolar damage with exudation of protein rich edema fluid, increased numbers of alveolar macrophages, and sloughed cellular debris. Syncytia are present in the parenchyma or airways (giant cell interstitial pneumonia), and air sac epithelium (Fig. 15.22\n). Both intranuclear and intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies are seen in syncytia and other cells. Lymphoid depletion with germinal center syncytia (Warthin-Finkeldy cells) may be seen.",

The typical childhood disease consists of fever, aches and pains, sore throat and parotid gland inflammation that causes swelling of the face and angle of the jaw (Rubin et al., 2015). Respiratory signs are also present because the respiratory tract is the portal of entry. Infection of the CNS occurs commonly but is largely asymptomatic, though aseptic meningitis can occur. Orchitis is common in puberal and adult males. Antibodies against mumps virus are detected in gorillas and chimpanzees (Wright et al., 1982). Natural disease in chimpanzees mimics the childhood syndrome with sialoadenitis (parotiditis), and pharyngeal and palatine erosions. Histologically there is interstitial and periglandular edema with perivascular and interstitial mononuclear cell inflammation and necrosis of acinar and ductal epithelium. Post infection scarring of the parotid gland may occur. Mumps virus causes syncytia formation in tissue culture, but syncytia are not reported in clinical cases (http://virology-online.com/viruses/MUMPS3.htm\n).",

Antibodies to influenza A and Influenza B are common in serosurveys of apes in captivity and in the wild (Buitendijk et al., 2014, Kalter and Heberling, 1978, Kalter et al., 1997, Whittier, 2010), and chimpanzees can be infected experimentally. Susceptibility to different strains depends on sialic acid cell surface receptors in the upper and lower respiratory tract and the surface proteins of the virus (Gagneux et al., 2003). There is debate about the infectivity of human influenza viruses in nonhuman primates in general (Davis et al., 1992); however, illness is often reported in ape collections at times when \u201cflu\u201d is circulating in the human population. Flu-like disease can be caused by a variety of respiratory viruses and serology or virus detection should be used to confirm the causative etiology (Hanamura et al., 2008). Morbidity in colony-housed gibbons infected with influenza A2 Hong Kong 68 included both respiratory and gastrointestinal signs (e.g., lethargy, anorexia, serous to mucous nasal discharge, cough, and diarrhea or constipation) (Johnsen et al., 1971). The gross lesion in gibbons is pneumonia, most severe in caudal lobes, with consolidation and hemorrhage. Fibrinous bronchointerstitial pneumonia is seen histologically with epithelial necrosis and sloughing in terminal bronchioles and filling of alveoli by fibrin, edema, erythrocytes, and macrophages. Bronchiolitis obliterans may be present focally. Secondary bacterial infections result in superimposed, suppurative bronchopneumonia. The absence of syncytia or inclusion bodies and presence of severe alveolar hemorrhage may help to differentiate \u201cflu\u201d from other fatal respiratory infections.",

Reservoir hosts are rodents, but the virus has broad host range including nonhuman primates, swine, carnivores, elephants and other exotic hoofstock. The transmission route is orally from food or water contaminated by infected rodent feces, and from ingestion of raw meat from an infected animal. The virus has broad tissue tropism but clinical signs are attributable to viral damage to beta cells of the pancreatic islets (causing type I diabetes, primarily in rodent models), myocardial fibers causing myocarditis, and infection of CNS tissues causing meningoencephalitis and/or myelitis. Placental infection and fetal death may occur in nonhuman primates and swine. Although EMCV causes cell death, pathogenicity is linked to a strong host inflammatory response (Carocci and Bakkali-Kassimi, 2012).",

Poliovirus transmission is fecal-oral. Virus multiplies in the oropharynx and intestinal mucosa, spreads to lymphoid tissues (especially tonsils, cervical lymph nodes, gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) and mesenteric lymph nodes), then becomes viremic leading to CNS infection. Fecal shedding may persist for months. Neurological lesions include nonsuppurative, polioencephalomyelitis with neuronal swelling, chromatolysis, neuron cell death, and neuronophagia. Inflammation is transiently neutrophilic becoming lymphocytic. Myelitis is centered on anterior (ventral) horns of the spinal cord and medulla. Occasional glial nodules are present in the motor cortex. Another enterovirus, C99, was implicated in acute flaccid paralysis resembling polio in a sanctuary-housed chimpanzee (Mombo et al., 2015).",

Serological evidence of natural infection can be found in zoo-housed gibbons, chimpanzees, orangutans and gorillas (Sa-nguanmoo et al., 2010). Chimpanzees can be infected experimentally (Popper et al., 1980). Spontaneous infection is usually subclinical, detected only with clinical chemistry, but fatal infections can occur. Acute lesions in chimpanzees consist of multifocal, predominately periportal, individual hepatocyte necrosis, and acidophilic bodies with moderate lymphocytic inflammation accompanied by mononuclear periportal hepatitis that breaches the limiting plate and bridges between portal areas.

Human hepadnaviruses are used experimentally to infect chimpanzees as a model for HBV vaccine development. Nonhuman primate HBV strains also exist in gibbons, orangutans, gorillas and chimpanzees in captivity and in the wild (Bonvicino et al., 2014). The prevalence of HBV exposure and chronic infection in chimpanzees in the US zoos is about 2%, and must be taken into account in management decisions (Meals et al., 2016). Ape to ape transmission can occur within and between species. The zoonotic potential of ape HBVs is unclear; however, there is documented transmission between a zoo-housed gorilla and a keeper. In apes, acute HBV infections are usually subclinical. Histologically, there is diffuse, panlobular \u201cactivation\u201d of sinusoidal lining cells and multifocal random individual hepatocyte necrosis (sometimes becoming confluent) with a few attendant lymphocytes. Acidophilic hepatocytes and multinucleated hepatocytes may be present, and elevation of liver enzymes, especially SGOT (AST), is seen. Histological lesions in chronic HBV carrier chimpanzees consist of marked lymphocytic periportal hepatitis without disruption of the limiting plate, and scattered \u201cground glass\u201d hepatocytes in which HBsAG can be demonstrated by immunohistochemistry (Thung et al., 1981).

Of the five recognized subtypes of African Ebola, three have been associated with outbreaks: Ebola Zaire, Ebola Sudan, and Ebola Bundigbugyo. Bats are suspected, but not proven reservoir hosts. Devastating outbreaks of African Ebola with population effects occur in chimpanzees, bonobos and western lowland gorillas in equatorial Africa (Walsh et al., 2003, Leroy et al., 2004a). Transmission is through direct contact with blood or other secretions from infected individuals, or ingestion of infected tissues. Experimental disease (rhesus and cynomolgus macaques) consists of a 2\u20136 day incubation period, early fever and petechial rash (in rhesus), depression, dyspnea, diarrhea, blood from the rectum and vagina, lymphopenia, and thrombocytopenia. Gross lesions include hemorrhage in the skin, lungs, liver, and spleen, splenomegaly, and interstitial pneumonia. Histologically, hemorrhage, hepatic lipidosis, hepatic necrosis with basophilic cytoplasmic inclusions, and lymphoid necrosis are reported in humans and experimentally infected primates. Macrophages are infected and inflammation is often lymphocytic and histiocytic. In the only description of naturally occurring Ebola in a chimpanzee, gross lesions suggestive of \u201chemorrhagic septicemia\u201d were seen (Wyers et al., 1999). Liver lesions include multifocal hepatitis, multinucleated hepatocytes throughout the parenchyma, and Kupffer cell hyperplasia. Eosinophilic intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies are seen in Kupffer cells but not hepatocytes. Lymphoid depletion with lymphocytolysis and hemorrhage is seen in the spleen along with \u201cfibrinoid necrosis\u201d in red pulp, especially in the marginal zones of the periarteriolar lymphoid sheaths. Splenic macrophages contain cytoplasmic inclusions, similar to those in the Kupffer cells. The presence of Ebola virus is confirmed with immunohistochemistry. Serological studies suggest some apes survive exposure to Ebola viruses (Leroy et al., 2004b).",

Virus is shed in the urine and feces, although the mode of transmission is uncertain. Antibodies against GALV can be identified in gibbons without evidence of disease (Siegal-Willott et al., 2015), but both natural and experimental infection can result in disease. Because GALV lacks viral oncogenes, latency may be prolonged and pathology variable depending on when and where proviral integration occurs. Accordingly, age at onset of illness varies, and disease course can be prolonged (up to 3 years). Conditions associated with GALV infection include malignant lymphoma, lymphoblastic leukemia, myelogenous (granulocytic) leukemia and \u201costeopetrosis\u201d of long bones. In cases of granulocytic leukemia there is marked circulating granulocytosis with infiltration of bone marrow, liver, lymph nodes, and spleen. Infiltrated tissues often have a greenish hue (chlorosis). Disease due to GALV is no longer prevalent in the US SSP populations of gibbons, and although antibodies are still present in some apes, it is thought that this disease may no longer be of concern (Brown and Tarlington, 2017).",

Two strains of SIVcpz exist, SIVcpzPtt infecting the central chimpanzee subspecies and SIVcpzPts infecting the eastern chimpanzee. Wild chimpanzees of the other two subspecies do not appear to be naturally infected. SIVgor appears to have arisen from cross-species transmission of SIVcpzPtt (Etienne et al., 2012). Cross-species transmission of SIVcpzPtt into humans is likely the origin of HIV-1 strains in phylogenetic Group M, the strain associated with the AIDS pandemic, as well as strains in Group N. In contrast, SIVgor appears to be the origin of HIV-1 Group O and P strains (D\u2019arc et al., 2015). Vertical transmission has been demonstrated for SIVcpz and SIVgor and horizontal transmission proven for SIVcpz and suspected for SIVgor (Rudicel et al., 2010).

Reports include pneumonia and meningitis in a juvenile wild chimpanzee, meningitis in chimpanzees and gorillas, respiratory disease including sinusitis and air sacculitis in gibbons, bonobos, lowland gorillas and orangutans, and tonsillitis in a captive gorilla (Solleveld et al., 1984, Unwin et al., 2013, van der Linden et al., 2009). Numerous strain and serotypes of S. pneumoniae have been described in humans and animals. In many cases, strain types of S. pneumoniae recovered from captive apes are similar to those identified in their human caretakers (Szentiks et al., 2009), raising the concern for anthropozoonotic and zoonotic transmission. Although nasopharyngeal carriage of S. pneumoniae occurs commonly in humans it is not thought to be a natural pharyngeal inhabitant in other primates.

Lesions of shigellosis in apes have not been well described but are expected to be similar to those noted in monkeys (i.e., colonic dysentery). Diagnosis is based on culture and or PCR. Salmonella spp. can cause acute hemorrhagic enterocolitis with septicemia especially in young, aged or immunocompromised individuals (Paix\u00e3o et al., 2014).

Humans are the main hosts of Mtb; transmission is by aerosolization or through fomites contaminated with human sputum and exudates. Oral infection can occur, especially in infant apes fed unpasteurized milk from cows or goats. The source of infection is not always evident, but transmission from caretakers, visitors, conspecifics, or other animals in a collection are described. In early days of ape zoo-keeping, this was one of the most common causes of mortality. When glass- fronted enclosures separate apes from human visitors, the incidence of tuberculosis (TB) in apes drops precipitously. At the Philadelphia Zoo, 43% of 7 ape deaths from 1901 to 1920 were due to TB, while from 1921 to 1975 only 11% of 98 apes necropsied had TB (most occurring early in the time period) (Snyder, 1978). Chimpanzees held in research facilities have been infected, but apes (especially orangutans) kept as pets, confiscated from illegal ownership, and housed in sanctuaries or rehabilitation centers with close human contact, are at especially high risk http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2011/11/24/tuberculosis-strikes-orangutans-sanctuary.html.",

The organism cannot be cultured on artificial media, but can be detected in lesions and environmental samples using nucleic acid amplification. Transmission route in apes is unknown, but in humans, close contact, infected aerosols, environmental reservoirs, and traumatic inoculation are established routes (Bratschi et al., 2015). To date, all naturally occurring cases have been in wild or wild-caught chimpanzees and no cases have been reported in in-contact apes born in captivity. One difficulty in studying M. leprae infections is the prolonged latency period and lack of accurate diagnostics for subclinical infections. Lesions can appear in captive chimpanzees decades after infection with organisms originating in country of capture (Suzuki et al., 2010). Lesions in apes are similar to those in humans and occur primarily on the face, ears and fingers. Early lesions are areas of cutaneous erosion that progress to coalescing dermal nodules. Histologically, the lesion are of the lepromatous, not tuberculoid, type, composed of activated macrophages/histiocytes with fewer lymphocytes, plasma cells and neutrophils. While inflammation can be diffuse, nodules characteristically surround deep dermal nerves and there is an overlying sub-epidermal zone lacking inflammatory cells (Hubbard et al., 1991, Leininger et al., 1980). Numerous acid-fast bacilli are present within histiocytes (multibacilllary) and in lower numbers in nerves. In a few cases, systemic spread of intrahistiocytic acid-fast bacilli has been noted. Some lesions are complicated by self-trauma. Diagnosis is based on the characteristic histological lesions. Bacteria stain more intensely with Fite-Faraco than Ziehl-Neelsen stains.",

In humans, tertiary yaws causes \u201cgangosa\u201d (syn. rhinopharyngitis mutilans) with severe destruction of the palate and nasopharynx, and \u201cgondou,\u201d which is characterized by bony proliferation of the maxilla.

Lesions suggestive of yaws osteitis have been seen in museum skeletons from chimpanzees and gorillas collected in West Africa, and gondou-like proliferative lesions on a gorilla skull are reported (Cousins, 2008).

These two species are separated by geography, cultural characteristics and molecular techniques. C. immitis is endemic to Mexico and the San Joaquin Valley of California, while C. posadasii is endemic elsewhere in California, Arizona, Texas, Mexico and South America. Infection is via inhalation of the small (<10 \u03bcm), air-borne, arthroconidia from saphrophytic hyphae in the soil. Once inhaled into the lungs, the conidia become larger spores or spherules that divide by endosporulation. Rupture leads to dissemination in the lungs and throughout the body by macrophage transport. Clinical signs include weight loss and cough. Lesions are typical of \u201cvalley fever\u201d in other species and include focal, multifocal or diffuse pyogranulomatous pneumonia with characteristic spherules readily recognized by size (10\u2013200 \u03bcm), thick, double-contoured refractile hyaline walls and endospores (2\u20134 \u03bcm).

Two species can parasitize hominids: Strongyloides fuelleborni (OW monkeys and apes natural hosts), and S. stercoralis (human natural host). Infection occurs when filariform larvae in the environment penetrate skin or mucous membranes, enter circulation, and travel through the heart to the lungs where they undergo further development in alveoli. Developing larvae are then coughed up, swallowed and penetrate the wall of small intestine where they develop into parthenogenic adult females that live in the crypts and produce eggs that are shed in the feces (S. fuelleborni) or hatch in the lumen to release larvae that are shed in the feces (S. stercoralis). Although infections are often asymptomatic, S. stercoralis can be associated with mortality due to hyperinfection in which larvae penetrate the colon wall instead of being shed in the feces (autoinfection), which results in heavy parasite loads. Ivermectin has reduced the incidence, but hyperinfection with S. stercorialis continues to be a cause of death in infant and juvenile orangutans. Clinical signs include cough, dyspnea, diarrhea or constipation, ileus, weight loss, and death. Gross lesion are often limited to pulmonary hemorrhage (Fig. 15.30\nA), but there may also be hemorrhagic or ulcerative enteritis and with mesenteric lymphadenopathy and pericarditis. Histologically, larvae can be seen in the lung where they are associated with acute interstitial pneumonia and multifocal mild to severe hemorrhage (Fig. 15.30B). They also may be found in the lumen, crypts, and intestinal lymphatics as well as in mesenteric lymph nodes. Adult worms are small and found in the intestinal glands/crypts (Fig. 15.31\n).

O. stephanostomum is the species most often identified in chimpanzees and gorillas. O. bifurcum can also infect African apes, creating concern for zoonotic transmission (Krief et al., 2008). The worms live and cause lesions in the colon and adjacent mesentery. The life cycle is direct and there is no systemic migration. Ingested larvae pass to the colon where they penetrate the mucosa forming a submucosal or mural nodule. In primary infections, mural lesions are small and heal after the 4th stage larvae exit into the lumen. However, when a host is reinfected, larvae may become trapped in the nodule by immune-mediated inflammation. Clinical signs range from none to severe diarrhea, weight loss, anemia, hypoproteinemia and mortality. Grossly, white, yellow, red, or black 2\u20135 mm nodules stud the colonic serosa and mesentery. Viable larvae may be seen in some nodules. Inflammation varies from necrotizing and hemorrhagic to granulomatous and can become suppurative due to secondary bacterial invasion (Fig. 15.32\n). The overlying mucosa may be normal, thickened, covered by a diphtheritic membrane or contains small ulcers. Rupture of the nodules or transmural extension of inflammation is associated with peritonitis and mesenteric/omental adhesions. If hypoproteinemia is present, hydropericardium and hydrothorax can occur. Ante mortem differentiation of the ova and larvae of hookworms and nodular worms in fecal samples is not always possible and PCR techniques have been developed for more reliable diagnosis (Verweij et al., 2007).",

Infection occurs via ingestion of eggs from environments contaminated with decomposed liver tissue or the feces of a predator or scavenger that has eaten an infected animal. Infection is identified at necropsy, and in mountain gorillas is usually incidental but occasionally severe in infants (Graczyk et al., 1999). Eggs with thick walls and bipolar caps (opercula) and adults with aphasmid morphology (hologonic, stichosome, bacillary bands, and characteristic eggs) are found in tracks in the liver parenchyma, often near portal areas. Reaction to the parasites varies from none to marked granulomatous hepatitis (Fig. 15.33\n). Capillaria brochieri, an enteric parasite, is reported to cause fatal diarrhea in bonobos (Justine 1988).",

Of greatest concern is hydatid disease due to Echinococcus granulosa (dog definitive host) or E. multilocularis (fox definitive host). Individuals with the former parasite may be infected in countries of origin, but those with the latter are infected after importation as E. multilocularis only occurs naturally in the Northern Hemisphere. Mortality from hydatid disease is reported in gorillas in zoos in the US, Europe, and Japan (Benirschke and Adams, 1980, Rehmann et al., 2003SSP data base). Gross lesions consist of abdominal enlargement due to uni- or multiloculated cysts that contain many daughter brood capsules and daughter cysts. Rupture of the cyst(s) leads to seeding of the peritoneum by the asexually dividing larvae, causing florid, chronic, effusive peritonitis. The liver may be replaced by necrosis and cystic, caseous or fibrotic nodules. Renal involvement may occur. Histologically, the wall of hydatid cysts, due to E granulosa, has a characteristic hyaline, laminated appearance. Inflammation ranges from suppurative to granulomatous. Hydatid disease differs from cysticercosis in that the cysticercus is a single thin walled cyst with single invaginated larval scolex in CNS or viscera (Sagartz and Tingpalapong, 1974). An unusual, fatal case of larval cestodiasis due to Versteria sp. (mustelid carnivore definitive host) occurred in a juvenile orangutan with a short clinical course of lethargy, anorexia and cough and gross lesions of hepatosplenomegaly, pulmonary hemorrhage and pericardial and thoracic effusions (Goldberg et al., 2014). On histology the liver contained uni- and multilocular, unencapsulated, thin walled cysts containing marginated, multinucleated parasitic protoplasm. Similar cysts were present in the lungs and spleen, often in blood vessels.",

Molecular studies have resulted in the suggested reassignment of the primate parasites to the genus Neobalantidium (Pomajb\u00edkov\u00e1 et al., 2013). B. coli-like ciliates are identified in free-ranging, sanctuary, zoo and colony housed apes, though infection is much more common in captive than in free-ranging populations (Kilbourn et al., 2003; Pomajb\u00edkov\u00e1 et al., 2010a). Balatidium is generally considered commensal, but can become invasive when animals are immune compromised, stressed or suffering from other causes of diarrhea (e.g., salmonellosis). Morbidity and mortality are described in western lowland gorillas, chimpanzees, and orangutans in zoos and in semi-captive (rehabilitant) orangutans (Lankester et al., 2008). Captive diets high in starch may allow for overgrowth of the organisms (Schovancov\u00e1 et al., 2013). The most common gross lesion is ulcerative typhlocolitis with hyperemia and hemorrhage in the colon and cecum and hemorrhagic diarrhea (dysentery) (Lankester et al., 2008). Histologically, the protozoa are present in the lumen, on the mucosal surface, within ulcer beds and throughout the wall (Fig. 15.34\n). The trophozoite stage has two nuclei and the cyst stage has a large, curved or horseshoe-shaped macronucleus. These and the distribution of circumferential cilia (holotrich) are useful morphologic features that aid in differentiating them from commensal ciliated protozoans, such as Troglodytella gorillae and T. gabonensis in wild gorillas and T. abraesarti in chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas, and siamangs in captivity (Pomajb\u00edkov\u00e1 et al., 2010b).",

It accounts for almost 3% of gorilla deaths in the North American SSP population and is described in zoo-housed apes in Europe and Australia. The presumed route of infection is inhalation of airborne cysts from contaminated soils or, rarely, through skin wounds. Brain lesions may be visible grossly as foci of malacia, congestion, or hemorrhage in both gray and white matter without specific geographic distribution (Fig. 15.35\n). Histologically, the infection is both necrotizing and granulomatous and often vasocentric with associated fibrinoid vasculitis (Fig. 15.36\nA, B). Organisms often cluster in Virchow-Robin spaces, but immunological staining reveals wider distribution. In some cases granulomatous inflammation and fibrosis, which cause mass lesions suggestive of neoplasia, are present in liver, kidney, pancreas and lymph nodes. Differential diagnosis includes cerebral amoebiasis due to E. histolytica or other free living amoeba (e.g., Nigleria or Acanthamoeba spp.). Amoeba are identified on the basis of nuclear morphology and shape and size of the karyosome. E. histolytica has a distinctive large karyosome. Balamuthia and Acanthamoeba are sometimes difficult to differentiate, though Balamuthia sometimes has a double endosome (Fig. 15.36B). Immunohistochemistry and PCR differentiation is available through the United States Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and some diagnostic laboratories (e.g., California Animal Health Laboratory System).",

They are thought to be an evolutionarily intermediate between Old World (OW) monkeys and the great apes. There are currently four recognized genera: Nomascus, Hylobates, Hoolock, and Symphalangus and 16 species. The first two are polyspecific, while Hoolock and Symphalangus are monospecific. Of note are the large scale karyotypic rearrangements that have occurred among the gibbon genera with diploid numbers of 38 (Hoolock), 44 (Nomascus), 50 (Symphalangus), and 52 (Hylobates) (Chaterjee, 2009), though hybridization has occurred between Nomascus and Hylobates and Hylobates and Symphanangus (Baichaeron et al., 2014; Myers and Shafer, 1979). All species are endangered or critically endangered (IUCN Red List). The full genome of a northern white-cheeked gibbon has been sequenced. It is thought that the gibbon lineage experienced rapid expansion or radiation about 5 million years ago, possibly due to dramatic climatic and habitat changes in the region (Carbone et al., 2014). In contrast to the great apes, gibbons exhibit little sexual size dimorphism though coat color dimorphism is found in several species. Most studies in wild gibbons have been directed toward behavioral ecology with little information on disease and health issues of wild populations, and although gibbons are common in zoos and have been used as research animals, there is surprisingly little in the literature on their spontaneous diseases and pathology.",

Many zoo and laboratory-housed chimps are hybrids of sub-species (Ely et al., 2005). The Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA) Chimpanzee Species Survival Program (SSP) manages chimpanzees as one species. While many of the chimpanzees in European zoos are also hybrids, the European AZA\u2019s (EAZA) European Endangered Species Program (EEP) manages Western chimpanzees in a separate studbook (Hvilsom et al., 2013). There is evidence that there are behavioral or \u201ccultural\u201d differences between the subspecies (Lycett et al., 2011) that have a genetic basis. There is also variation in genes coding for bitter taste receptors, possibly reflecting selection based on different diets in geographic ranges of the different subspecies (Hayakawa et al., 2012). Chimpanzee viruses have also been affected by the divergence of subspecies a million years ago (Hey, 2010). For example, SIVcpzPtt in the Central African chimpanzee is the progenitor of HIV-1, while the SIVcpzPts of Eastern chimpanzees does not seem to cross into humans. Thus far no SIVs have been found in bonobos in the wild or in managed care (Li et al., 2012).",

Diet in the wild consists mainly of fruit with varying amounts of leaves and insects (Whitten, 1982). The siamang is considered to be primarily follivorous (Leigh, 1994). An interesting aspect of gibbon natural history is their vocalization with duetting between mates (Clarke et al., 2006, Tenaza, 1976). Calling is facilitated by throat sacs, most prominent in the siamang in which the there is a balloon like expansion during vocalization.",

Orangutans in zoos often spend considerable time on the ground, while wild Bornean orangutans spend less than 5% of the time on the ground (Ashbury et al., 2015). Females and juveniles mainly come down to eat termites, while the adult males become terrestrial mainly in traveling distances across clearings; all age classes come down to drink and \u201cbathe\u201d in standing water. However, depending on habitat, anthropogenic disturbances do not drive terrestriality (Ancrenaz et al., 2014). Diet is strongly frugivorous, though fallback foods, such as flowers, leaves, bark, insects, and vertebrates including fish and, rarely, smaller mammals, such as slow lorises and squirrels, are also eaten depending on the season and the availability of fruit (Buckley et al., 2015; Hardus et al, 2012; Russon et al., 2014). Protein is often limited in orangutan diets (Vogel et al., 2012). Orangutan metabolism has evolved to deal with the feast or famine situation of periodic fruit abundance (masting) and failure (Harrison et al., 2010; Kanamori et al., 2017), which may account for some of the metabolic problems encountered in captive management situations (reviewed in Lowenstine et al., 2016). Geophagy (eating earth) has been reported in orangutans (Mahaney et al., 2016).",

            "text": "The African apes are all generally forest animals though habitats consisting of mosaics of woodlands and savannahs are use by both bonobos and common chimpanzees. Chimpanzees, bonobos, and gorillas all spend more time on the ground than do the Asian apes, utilizing trees as sleeping sites and for travel. Adaptations for this life style include knuckle walking with the dorsal surface of phalanges 2 and 3 of digits 2\u20135 contacting the ground, necessitating specialize knuckle pads on the fingers, and a flatter backed posture in apes than monkeys. Both Pan species are considered \u201chighly frugivorous omnivores\u201d meaning that fruits, in addition to other plant parts, are major components of their diets. Gorillas are more strictly vegetarians, eating a wide variety of plant types and parts including grasses, leaves, stems/pith, bark, fruits and, occasionally, insects (Deblauwe and Janssens, 2008). Western lowland gorillas are more strongly frugivorous than the Eastern gorillas; however, when Western gorillas and chimpanzees utilize the same forests, there is partitioning of resources such that chimpanzees are more frugivorous and gorillas rely more on herbaceous plants (Oelze et al, 2014). Insectivory is well described in the African apes (Rothman et al., 2014) and consists primarily of consumption of termites and ants (Hamad et al., 2014). Both bonobos and chimpanzees kill vertebrate prey including rodents and smaller nonhuman primates, and although providing a good source of high quality protein, this is a minor part of their diets (Moore et al., 2017, Sakamaki et al., 2016, Tennie et al., 2014). African apes obtain minerals through geophagy, which may also serve as a way to ameliorate digestive problems including parasitism, though soil ingestion may conversely pose a risk for parasite acquisition (Krishnamani and Mahney, 2000). Rotten logs may be eaten as a source of sodium (Rothman et al., 2006).",

Hybridization in captive settings threatens some subspecies. Anthropogenic threats to orangutan populations include deforestation by logging and palm oil plantations, habitat fragmentation, wildfires (often related to human activities), and hunting for the pet trade and bush meat. Other than humans, orangutans have no natural predators. For the African apes, threats are similar: habitat disruption and loss due to mining and logging, hunting for commercial bush meat trade, accidental entrapment (snares set for other animals), and also include diseases, such as Ebola (Western lowland gorillas and chimpanzees), anthrax-like infection (mainly chimpanzees) and respiratory diseases (chimpanzees, mountain gorillas) (Walsh et al., 2003).

Not all gibbons have air sacs, but in the siamang there is a highly distensible central \u201cgular sac\u201d that is blown up like a balloon during vocalization. Air sacs are large in both chimpanzees and bonobos, but are more voluminous in gorillas and orangutans extending ventrally under the clavicles into the axilla and dorsally around the neck. The air sacs of apes arise primarily from the lateral saccules of the larynx rather than through a ventral ostium at the base of the thyroid cartilage (thyrohyoid membrane) (Riede et al., 2008). Gibbons, chimpanzees and gorillas, but not orangutans, have a small midline hyoid air sac that may give rise to the intraosseous bulla in the body of the hyoid bone (Steele et al., 2013). Other than the hyoid bulla, the air sacs of the great apes are a contiguous space, but septation may develop in chronic air sacculitis. In chimpanzees the lateral extensions are reported to be asymmetrical, but pathologists should confirm this during necropsy (Swindler and Wood, 1982). Air sac lining epithelium is generally ciliated ranging from cuboidal to pseudostratified. Although cilia are present, clearance is limited. The adventitia is well vascularized, fibro-fatty tissue with sparse flat bands of skeletal muscle and nerves. The air sac membrane is closely applied to underlying muscle fascia and to the overlying dermis/hypodermis. Fat often comprises a large proportion of the externally visible, pendulous \u201cthroat sac\u201d in orangutans.",

Umbilical cord lengths for orangutans ranged from 40 to 75 cm and attachment was often central rather than marginate as in the other apes (see also Supplemental Materials Table e2\n). Elongated umbilical cords can develop knots and cause fetal strangulation. Short cords can limit fetal mobility leading to contractures.

In the mountain gorilla, the muscularis of the distal approximately one-fourth is smooth muscle, while that of the middle is mixed and the upper portion is striated muscle, similar to humans. This needs to be characterized in other apes. All apes have a simple stomach which is elongated (chimpanzee) to globular (orangutan). Histologically there is a limited region of cardiac glands around the gastroesophageal junction, a body of stomach with proper gastric glands and a large pyloric region (Stevens and Hume, 1995). Pyloric glands are rich in mucous cells and sections can be confused with colon histologically. However, colonic glands have no coiling or branching of the crypts and colonic surface epithelium is cuboidal rather than columnar. The duodenum is \u201cs\u201d shaped. The proximal duodenum contains abundant Brunner\u2019s lands (especially in gorillas) (Krause, 1975). Paneth cells are present in small intestinal crypts. The length of the small intestine is proportionately longer in orangutans than chimpanzees, as is the length and volume of the colon and cecum. Gorillas have the most capacious large intestine of all the apes in keeping with a high degree of follivory. All apes have taenia (bands) and haustra (saccules) in the large intestine and diverticulosis and diverticulitis of the haustra can occur. All apes have a vermiform appendix which is particularly long in the orangutan. Histologically it is endowed with abundant gut-associated lymphoid tissues (GALT) which diminishes with age (Fisher, 2000, Scott, 1980, Smith et al., 2009).",

A guide for trimming macaque brains can be used as an aid in sectioning ape brains (Pardo et al., 2012). The major lobation is similar in great apes and humans and topology has been studied using MRI (Semendeferi and Damasto, 2000). The temporal lobes of the cerebral cortices are well developed and separated from the rest of the cerebral cortex by a deep Sylvian fissure (Sulcus lateralis), and the cerebral cortices contain many gyrations. The average brain mass of an adult chimpanzee is 381.7 \u00b1 37.2 g and that of a neonate 150.9 \u00b1 17 (DeSilva and Lesnik, 2006).

Early knowledge of ape viruses relied on solely on serosurveys, detection of viruses via histopathology and ultrastructure, and/or virus isolation in cell culture (all of which are still useful in the molecular era) (Kalter et al., 1969, Soike et al., 1969). A large number of virus have been identified, but many viruses went undetected or uncharacterized because they could not be grown in cell cultures. Modern sensitive techniques allow for detection of minute amounts of viral nucleic acid in samples, such as feces, urine, and saliva (Gillespie et al., 2008, Smiley Evans et al., 2016). Not only has this allowed identification of novel viruses, but it has also proved valuable for epidemiological studies. Caution must be exercised; however, because some of these sequences, especially those in feces, may be of prey item origin as chimpanzees and to a lesser extent in bonobos and orangutans are known to prey on other mammalian species including primates (De Nys et al 2015). The presence of viral nucleic acid also does not mean that the agent is causing disease. Virus discovery is often reported without accompanying clinical or anatomic pathological confirmation of associated lesions or location of virus replication. Likewise, seropositivity indicates exposure significant enough to cause seroconversion, but does not indicate ability of the agent to actually cause disease in the species. This means that the significance to ape health of many of the detected viruses remains uncertain. The virus infections of apes that have been associated with clinical illness and/or confirmed lesions have been covered in the text.
