These particles have previously been described in the brain i n MS and i n brain-derived cell cultures in subacute sclerosing panencephalitis. In both cases they were interpreted as papovaviruses, but in size, morphology and distribution they are identical to the reticulosomes and related particles which occur as proteinaceous artefacts i n a variety of tissues and in subcellular fractions. Inclusions i n endothelial cell cytoplasm, previously reported from the CNS in MS as paramyxovirus similar to measles, have also been found in the present study. They were present both in MS and i n control brains and are identified as 'rod-shaped tubular bodies', normally occurring organelles of endothelial cells. The necessity for a cautious interpretation of viruslike inclusions is emphasized.",

Suggestions that a virus might be involved in its pathogenesis (e.g. Adams & Imagwa, 1962) have stimulated a search for viral particles during EM studies of MS brain at biopsy and necropsy, of cell cultures derived directly or indirectly from such brain, and of peripheral lymphocytes from MS patients. These searches have revealed a bewildering variety of 'virus like particles' and other unusual inclusions. Attention has centred mainly on the 'pararnyxovirus-like' filaments found in the nuclei of unidentified perivascular cells (Prineas, 1972) . Although this initial finding was confirmed, similar filaments were subsequently reported from a wide range of other, apparently unrelated diseases and it now seems likely that they are a n unusual form of nuclear chromatin unrelated to viruses (Lampert & Lampert, 1975; Prineas, 1975; Mirra & Takei, 1976) . Moreover, in a number of studies where identification of parainfluenza or measles virus was not in doubt (ter Meulen, Koprowski, Iwasaki, Kackell & Muller, 1972; Iwasaki, Koprowski, Muller, ter Meulen & Kackell, 1973; Field, Cowshall, Narang & Bell, 1972; Thorne & Dermott, 1976 ) the techniques used involved indirect 'viral rescue' in cell culture with its attendant well-recognized risk of contamination by non MS-associated virus (Field et al., 1972) .",

Isolated reports of single MS cases containing particles resembling papovaviruses (Bauer, ter Meulen, Koprowski, Argyrakis & Orthner, 1975) and coronaviruses (Tanaka, Iwasaki & Koprowski, 1976) have also appeared and there are several reports of unspecified 'virus-like' inclusions (e.g. Boyazis, Martin, Bouteille, Guazzi & Manacorda 1967; Andrews & Andrews, 1973) . That these may not always be what they seem is shown by the controversy over the 'budding' virus-like particles found in a n MS biopsy by Narang & Field (197313) . These were subsequently reinterpreted by Hill (1973) as nuclear pores, a view not accepted by the original authors (Narang & Field 1973~) .",

Because of their number and diversity it is convenient to consider them in two main categories namely intranuclear and extranuclear. The former group which comprises non-viral 'paramyxovirus-like filaments', fibrillar lattices, vesicular nuclear bodies and 'crystalloid honeycombs' will be described i n a subsequent paper (Kirk, 1978~) . The two kinds of cytoplasmic inclusions described in detail in the present paper have previously been seen in MS CNS tissue where they were reported as viruses (Bauer et Pathak & Webb, 1976) . One kind has also been reported in brain cell cultures derived from cases of SSPE where they were also identified as viruses (Oyanagi, ter Meulen, Muller, Katz & Koprowski, 1970; Koprowski, Barbanti-Brodano & Katz, 1970) . We have had the opportunity of examining these inclusions more closely and in a variety of locations and have come to different con-clusions as to their nature. The more difficult questions concerning the nature of dense cored particles and hollow-cored vesicles which were also found i n this study, will be tackled in further papers in this series (Kirk, 1978a; 1978b) .",

EM blocks were taken a t necropsy from the brains of eight patients dying with non-neurological conditions. Secondly, material was available from a number of cerebral biopsies, mostly done for suspected viral encephalitis but also from a case of oligodendroglioma, a case of sarcoidosis and several cases of dementia. Fixation of EM blocks was carried out by immersion for 4 h or overnight in chilled 2.5% glutaraldehyde in either 0.1 M s-collidine or 0.1 M phosphate buffer.

Areas for viewing in the MS material were not initially selected for the purpose of finding inclusions. Rather, they were selected so as to be representative of the white matter in MS.

They were present both in the MS material and in the control material being more commonly seen in the former. Within the cell they were most frequently seen clustering near to the intercellular junctions ( Figure  6 ). Morphologically the bodies were irregular cylinders bounded by a single membrane. Internally they contained a number of 20-23 nm tubules which presented as mainly circular profiles in transverse section and as parallel lines in longitudinal section. Occasional bodies cut in near transverse section contained mixtures of short linear and circular profiles (Figures 6 & 7b) . At high magnification ( Figure 7b ) the walls of some tubules appeared trilamellar. The background matrix in which the tubules were set was variable in electron density, most commonly being rather dense (Figures 6 & 7b) but in some cases light (Figure 7a ). The bodies with light background matrices were uncommon and when present were near the adluminal membrane of the endothelial cells. Under some circumstances, a narrow often indistinct electron lucid halo was seen underlying the bounding membrane. In some apparently poorly fixed material this halo was enlarged giving the body an uncharacteristic but none the less recognisable appearance (Figure 7b , inset). In occasional bodies the bounding membrane did not appear as a distinct dense line. Instead the electron lucid halo was sharply circumscribed by an irregularly thick electron-dense band which merged with the surrounding artifactually dense and clumped cytoplasm (Figure 7b) .",

            "text": "While it is generally accepted that coated vesicles and reticulosomes do appear in electron micrographs of nervous system and other tissues, interpretation of their structure and possible function has proved difficult and controversial. The generally accepted view (Peters et al., 1976; Kanaseki & Kadota, 1969) has been that reticulosomes are the empty shells or baskets of coated vesicles. These coats or baskets were believed to be formed around the vesicles either at the cell membrane or at the forming facing of the golgi apparatus. They were subsequently lost as the vesicle became (for example) a normal uncoated synaptic vesicle. However, more recently, Gray (1972; has formulated and developed an alternative interpretation which has profound implications for those seeking to interpret electron micrographs of animal tissues. He now believes them to be one manifestation of a n intracellular 'stereoframework' which forms as a denaturization and precipitation artifact in areas rich in protein complexes. A stereoframework appears as a reticular structure forming a three-dimensional framework around polygonal lucunae. Gray proposed that it has no direct relationship to the molecular architecture of the particular protein complex in viro. Intracellularity it may appear for example as the coat on a coated vesicle, as the 'microfilamentous network' of growth cones, as the presynaptic 'dense projections', as the post-synaptic dense material, and as the 'pore complexes' in the inner and outer orifices of the nuclear pores. Nuclei, too, may contain stereoframeworks, but their composition is still a matter for debate. Gray (1975) for example has suggested that chromatin may appear as one, but the 'nuclear matrix framework' (Berezney & Coffey, 1977) which remains intact after removal of almost all chromatin, fits the description better. Somc further light on the nature of stereoframeworks has been shed by recent work on clathrin, the coat protein of coated vesicles. First isolated and biochemically characterized by Pearse (1976), clathrin was described as a unique protein with a molecular weight of 180 000. Schook, Oress & Pusz (1977) have since demonstrated that clathrin can form a micro-filamentous net in uitro. Negatively-stained preparations of this net have shown it to have a 'stereoframework' structure, while fixation in glutaraldehyde causes the filaments to disassemble. Schook and his colleagues have proposed that synaptic vesicles may exist in vivo enmeshed in a cytonet (a kind of cytoplasmic stereoframework) and that coated vesicles may originate from the fragmentation of such structures. Whether stereoframeworks actually exist in, vivo as a coherent, physical structure as this work might suggest or whether they are formed de nouo during fixation from a matrix of colloidal proteins as Gray (1975) suggested, are questions which remain to be answered. Whatever the outcome, however, the work of both schools supports the notion that both reticulosomes and the coats of coated vesicles are artefactual, resulting from the clumping of protein material into spheroids or onto the surface of vesicles respectively. Bauer et al. (1975) reported the finding of 'particles identical in form and size with papovavirus' in a n axon from the cerebellar white matter of a case of MS taken a t autopsy. However, their illustration is of reticular particles with electron-lucid halos which are clearly reticulosomes, indistinguishable from our Figure 1 . They bear only a superficial resemblance to the crystalloid aggregates of papova virus which are seen for example in progressive multifocal leucoencephalopathy (Zu Rhein, 1969; Mazlo & Herndon, 1977) and in other conditions (Jordan & Doughty, 1969) . The absence of intranuclear particles might also be considered atypical for papovavirus. MS is not the only condition in which confusion has arisen due to the similarity of reticulosomes and papovaviruses. Oyanagi et al. (1970) and Koprowski et al. (1970) for example illustrate 60 nm 'papovavirus-like' particles which they found in the cytoplasm in brain cell cultures derived from a biopsy in a case of SSPE. Their illustrations, however, are of reticular particles with halos, identical in morphology and size to reticulosomes. Moreover, some of their illustrations bear a striking resemblance to Haguenau's (1973) illustration of 'nuclear pores simulating viruses', a finding that incidentally supports Gray's stereoframework hypothesis. Whether or not papovavirus is actually present in SSPE is not within our scope to discuss. However, morphological evidence of the kind described above is clearly inadequate and misleading.",

In pathological human CNS tissue, in particular in and around tumours, they are frequently increased in number, more pleomorphic and more conspicuous (Ohsugi & Hirano, 1977) . The present report is the first recognition of their occurrence in MS brain. However, in 1976 Pathak & Webb described 'spherical masses 250-300 nm in diameter consisting of many twisted tubular structures 16-17 nm in diameter'. These were seen 'generally in the cytoplasm, particularly of the endothelial cells of blood vessels'. They did not perceive a clear limiting membrane round the bodies rather they saw either dense material or a clear space.

In the first place the measurements given of tubule size appear t o be a n underestimate if one is considering overall outer diameter. This would put the tubules outside the size range of the paramyxoviruses and into that of the microtubules found in 'tubular bodies'. Secondly, the absence of a 'clear' limiting membrane is, we believe, probably artefactual. There is in fact a sharp discontinuity in electron density at the outer margin of their 'clear space' and as in our Figure 7b the densely clumped cytoplasmic material grades into the dense, but fuzzy, membrane material. In the micrographs of Pathak & Webb the same effect is seen in parts of the plasmalemma and i n the outer membrane of the nuclear envelope. The final piece of evidence is that the appearance, distribution and intracellular location of their bodies is in keeping with what we would expect if they were tubular bodies, i.e. in endothelial cells and near to inter-endothelial cell junctions. The significance of Pathak & Webb's intranuclear findings remains unclear.",

In the endothelial cells of meningiomas, vacuolar RTR (like our Figure 7a ) have been seen to fuse with each other and with the plasma membrane to give rise to pores (Ohsugi & Hirano, 1977) . Although the function of RTB is not known, there is some evidence implicating them in adrenalin-dependent blood coagulation enhancement (Burri & Weibel, 1968) .
