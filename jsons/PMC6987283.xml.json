            "text": "Histone modifications are closely related to the regulation of gene expression and genome function by changing the global chromatin structure. Among these various modifications, histone acetylation is an important component of chromatin decondensation, which greatly influences chromatin structure and function. This acetylation process disturbs histone/DNA interactions and changes histone/histone interactions in the nucleosome, which is relatively stable and plays an important role in regulating gene transcription by providing binding sites for the recruitment of transcription factors [1]. In contrast, histone deacetylation changes the electrostatic properties of chromatin and tends to gene suppression [2]. The acetylation and deacetylation of histones are dynamically regulated by histone acetyltransferases (HATs) or histone deacetylases (HDACs) [3, 4]. Abnormal histone acetylation or deacetylation is closely related to a variety of tumours: acute myeloid leukaemia [5], T cell lymphoma [6], acute promyelocytic leukaemia [7], B-cell lymphomas [8], ovarian carcinoma [9], gastric cancer [10], colorectal tumours [11], gliomas [12], prostate cancer [13], lung cancer [14], breast carcinoma and medulloblastoma [15], oesophageal squamous cell carcinomas [16], and pancreatic cancer [17]. H2AZ, the most conserved variant of H2A, is associated with chromatin integrity and transcriptional regulation [18, 19]. In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, acetylated H2AZ is enriched in the promoter regions of active genes [20]. The role and biological function of H2AZK4/7AC in tumours have not yet been clarified. The results of our study, provide deep insight into the role of H2AZK4/7AC in glioma with EGFR variant III (EGFR-vIII) overexpression.",

The traditional treatment for GBM is surgical excision followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy and adjuvant chemotherapy. However, the benefits of this treatment have been limited. EGFR-vIII, the result of EGF receptor mutation, is mostly involved in GBM; EGFR-vIII occurs in the classic subtype of GBM and is found in approximately one-third of GBMs [21]. The EGFR-vIII mutation was found to continuously activate downstream pathways to promote proliferation, survival, invasion, and angiogenesis [22]. The PI3K-AKT pathway, one of the main downstream signalling pathways of EGFR, is continuously activated when EGFR is mutated [12]. Previous researchers found that PI3K-AKT pathway activation could promote HDAC2 transcription and translation, accelerating the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma [23]. In our study, we found that HDAC2 expression was upregulated in EGFR-vIII-expressing cells and that HDAC2 may be a target for EGFR-activated GBM.",

In this study, we confirmed that EGFR-vIII epigenetically silenced ubiquitin-specific protease 11 (USP11) in vitro and in vivo, which mediated tumour suppression though blocking cell cycle progression [25]. EGFR-vIII activated the PI3K-AKT pathway to upregulate HDAC2 expression, which then reduced H2AZK4/7AC level to silence USP11. Recent studies showed that the recruitment of HDAC1 and HDAC2 to chromatin in complexes repressed transcription [26\u201328].

U87-vIII cells presented lower levels of H2AZ acetylation at positions 4 and 7 than U87 cells (Fig. 1a). To determine whether H2AZK4/7AC is negatively regulated by EGFR-vIII, we performed Western blot and immunofluorescence assays. The results showed that the protein level of H2AZK4/7AC was lower in U87, U251, and N9 cells when EGFR-vIII was overexpressed (Fig. 1b, d). Wild-type EGFR (EGFRwt) and EGFR-vIII have similar downstream signalling molecules, and stimulating EGFRwt caused the same downstream changes observed after EGFR-vIII stimulation [35]. To investigate whether H2AZK4/7AC can be downregulated by EGFRwt stimulation, like EGFR-vIII stimulation, EGF was used to stimulate U87 cells, following which H2AZK4/7AC was downregulated (Fig. 1c). EGFR-vIII is important for promoting tumorigenesis and progression, so we hypothesize that H2AZK4/7AC downregulation is associated with malignant GBM progression.\n",

This suggested that HDACs play an important role in regulating H2AZK4/7AC. HDAC1 and HDAC2, which are class I HDACs, exhibit a wide range of expression in tumours and strong enzymatic activity for many histone substrates. To determine whether HDAC1 and/or HDAC2 can specifically regulate H2AZK4/7AC levels, we first performed Co-IP assays and found an endogenous interaction between H2AZ and HDAC1/2 in U87-vIII cells (Fig. 2b). Then, HDAC2 knockdown, the effect of which was verified by using RT-qPCR, in U87-vIII, U251-vIII and N9-vIII cells (Fig. 2c) up-modulated H2AZK4/7AC in U87-vIII, U251-vIII and N9-vIII cells (Fig. 2d). Although HDAC1 can bind H2AZ, HDAC1 and HDAC2 do not have the same enzyme activity against H2AZK4/7AC (Fig. 2d). Immunofluorescence co-staining and a plot profile of HDAC2 and H2AZ expression in U87-vIII cells also showed their co-localization in the nucleus (Fig. 2e). Generally, these data showed that HDAC2 can specifically downregulate H2AZK4/7AC at the protein level in GBM (Fig. 2f).\n",

            "text": "Class I HDACs are highly expressed in a variety of human tumours [36\u201340] and play an important role in the malignant progression of cancer. The EGFR signal transduction network is highly complex and consists of multiple signalling pathways. Activation of EGFR in cancer cells can activate several linear pathways, and the PI3K/AKT axis, one of the major downstream pathways, participates in regulating tumour cell proliferation, growth, survival and angiogenesis. EGFR-vIII can continuously activate the PI3K/AKT pathway without EGF stimulation [12]. Activation of the PI3K-AKT pathway upregulated HDAC2 expression at the mRNA and protein levels in hepatocellular carcinoma [23]. To determine whether EGFR-vIII can upregulate the expression of HDAC2 by continuous PI3K/AKT pathway activation, RT-qPCR was performed. The results showed that EGFR-vIII could upregulate the expression of HDAC2 at the mRNA level in U87, U251, and N9 cells (Fig. 3a). The activation of EGFR-vIII also upregulated HDAC1 transcription in U87 and N9 cells but not in U251 cells (Fig. 3a). Western blotting showed that HDAC2 expression was upregulated at the protein level in U87, U251, and N9 cells and that HDAC1 translation was increased in U87 and N9 cells upon EGFR-vIII activation (Fig. 3b). This finding was consistent with the RT-qPCR results. Then, we treated U251-vIII cells with LY294002, a PI3K inhibitor, which induced a dose-dependent increase in HDAC2 expression (Fig. 3c). To investigate whether PI3K/AKT pathway inhibition would have the same effect on HDAC2 in U87-vIII and N9-vIII cells, LY294002 (40 \u03bcm) was administered. Inhibition of the PI3K/AKT pathway inhibited HDAC2 expression in U87-vIII and N9-vIII cells (Fig. 3c). These results indicated that EGFR-vIII upregulates HDAC2 transcription and translation through activating the PI3K/AKT pathway.\n",

Deletion of both HDAC1 and HDAC2 leads to severe phenotypes. HDAC1 and HDAC2 have been known to deacetylate histone H3K27 [42, 43]. We inhibited both HDAC1 and HDAC2 and found that H2AZK4/7AC and H3K27AC were upregulated in U87-vIII, U251-vIII and N9-vIII cells (Fig. 3d), while there was no change in H3K27me3 levels (Fig. 3d). We performed single silencing of HDAC1 and 2 and found there was no significant change with H3K27AC. In contrast with double silencing of HDAC1 and HDAC2 (Additional file 1: Figure S1).

Emerging evidence has shown that the PI3K/AKT pathway can inhibit USP11 transcription and translation. LY294002 was used to treat U87-vIII, U251-vIII and N9-vIII cells, and PI3K/AKT pathway inhibition resulted in the transcriptional and translational upregulation of USP11 (Fig. 5e, h). The USP11 promoter-associated increase in H3 acetylation and decrease in H3K27 trimethylation were reported to result in the transcriptional activation of USP11 [46]. Bioinformatics analysis showed a significant negative correlation between HDAC1 and USP11 (Fig. 5 g).

Bioluminescence imaging showed the degree of tumour growth in DMSO-treated U87 cell xenograft mice, DMSO-treated U87-vIII cell xenograft mice and FK228-treated U87-vIII cell xenograft mice (Fig. 7a). The FK228-treated group showed significantly inhibited tumour growth compared with the DMSO-treated groups (Fig. 7b, d).

IHC staining showed that EGFR-vIII activation significantly upregulated the expression of P-AKT, HDAC1 and HDAC2 and downregulated H2AZK4/7AC, H3K27AC and USP11 expression (Fig. 7e). In addition, FK228 treatment decreased the expression of CDK4 and CDK6 and increased P21 expression (Fig. 7f). Furthermore, FK228 treatment upregulated H2AZK4/7AC and H3K27AC expression and enhanced USP11 expression (Fig. 7f).

Therefore, the need to identify the potential mechanisms resulting in GBM malignant progression and develop corresponding effective targets is urgent. The EGFR-vIII mutation is a common malignant event in GBM. Deng and his colleagues found that the deubiquitinase USP11 could inhibit cell cycle progression from G1 to S phase though stabilizing P21 [25]. In our study, we found for the first time that H2AZK4/7AC downregulation contributed to GBM malignant progression when EGFR-vIII was activated. We demonstrated that the EGFR-vIII mutation downregulated H2AZK4/7AC and H3K27AC, inhibiting USP11 expression though the PI3K/AKT-HDAC1/2 axis. FK228, a specific HDAC1 and HDAC2 inhibitor, was shown to have anti-tumour effects though inducing G1/S transition arrest in GBM in vitro and in vivo. Our findings provide persuasive evidence that the histone deacetylase inhibitor FK228 can remodel the cancer epigenome to induce cell cycle progression arrest, affording new insights for the exploration of prospective targets for GBM therapies.",

The concurrent blockade of HDAC1 and HDAC2 induced cell cycle arrest, but the specific mechanisms of this effect in GBM cells were not clear. In our study, the concurrent inhibition of HDAC1 and HDAC2 upregulated USP11 and induced G1/S transition arrest in GBM cells in vitro and in vivo. USP11 was reported to have tumour-suppressive functions in brain tumours [46] and serve as a negative regulator of the cell cycle [25]. We assume FK228-induced G1/S transition arrest had an anti-tumour effect in GBM though epigenetic remodelling to upregulate USP11 expression. This work will continue in future research.",

Previous researchers found that H2AZ could be acetylated by Esa1 and Gcn5 in yeast [20, 48], but the mechanism of human histone H2AZ acetylation is still unclear. We demonstrated for the first time that histone H2AZ could be acetylated at lysine residues 4 and 7 by HDAC2 in human cancer cells. This finding provides new insight into the potential role of HDAC2 in tumorigenesis. Since Bonenfant and his colleagues observed the acetylation of human replacement histone H2AZ at lysine residues 4 and 7 for the first time [49], the function of H2AZAC has received extensive attention. H2AZAC was reported to play an important role in active gene expression at promoter regions in cancer, and the deacetylation of H2AZ was found to induce gene repression [50]. However, the specific function of H2AZK4/7AC in GBM is still poorly understood. Our results indicated that H2AZK4/7AC combined with H3K27AC bound promoter regions to enhance USP11 expression in U87 cells. When EGFR-vIII was activated, the binding of H2AZK4/7AC and H3K27AC at USP11 promoter regions was reduced, which led to USP11 inhibition. These findings provide new insight into the role of H2AZK4/7AC in GBM tumorigenesis.",

Several studies have suggested that HDAC inhibitors can inhibit tumour development and progression though inducing cell cycle arrest, inducing apoptosis, reducing chemotherapy resistance and inhibiting angiogenesis [51\u201353]. FK228 has been used in phase II trials to treat breast cancer (https://clinicaltrials.gov). The EGFR-vIII mutation is the most common malignant event in GBM, and there is no effective treatment for GBM with EGFR-vIII mutation thus far. Therefore, the need to develop a new treatment strategy for EGFR-vIII GBM is urgent. In our study, we demonstrated for the first time that FK228 could induce cell cycle arrest to treat GBM with EGFR-vIII mutation. FK228 could enhance anti-tumour activity against GBM by upregulating the expression of the tumour suppressor USP11. Our results indicate a new therapeutic target and an effective treatment for GBM with EGFR-vIII mutation. Significant progress has been made in the treatment of gliomas with drug combinations [54]. Our study might inspire the combination of FK228 and other small molecule inhibitors with other drugs, although further studies are needed.",
