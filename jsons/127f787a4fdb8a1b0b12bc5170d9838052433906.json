In this context, a main, albeit often forgotten, stressor to body functional reserves, especially in older patients, is not only severe infections or other acute conditions per se but also forced inactivity. The latter can severely deteriorate the so-called intrinsic capacity (the combination of mental and physical function), which, according to the World Health Organization, is a major determinant of health in our progressively older society.",

Most hospitalized adults (~82%), especially those > 80 years old (~96%), present disability, with mobility and self-care the most commonly affected domains of the International lose their ability to independently perform 1 or more activities of daily living from hospital admission to discharge even with successful treatment of the condition that caused the hospitalization, the so-called hospital-induced disability [2] . This condition has major negative consequences in the short and long term, including an increased risk of re-admission and mortality [2] . In addition, critically ill patients experience severe muscle wasting (\"ICU-acquired weakness\") from the first week of hospitalization [3] . No pharmacological intervention can prevent (or reverse) the functional deterioration that accompanies hospital confinement. By contrast, as confirmed in a recent meta-analysis, simple early mobilization programs have been found useful to attenuate the deleterious consequences of disuse observed upon discharge in older adults (> 60 years old) hospitalized for an acute medical condition [4] .",

Moreover, a recent trial reported the benefits on physical performance and disease symptoms (fatigue, cough) of an intervention combining physical exercise and neuromuscular electrical stimulation (i.e., the generation of involuntary muscle contractions via the application of intermittent electrical stimuli to skeletal muscles) in older adults (mean age 75 years) hospitalized due to pneumonia [6] .",

However, despite these recommendations, early mobilization is still uncommon in most ICUs (applied in ~16% of patients) [8] . In this regard, a recent meta-Page 3 of 6 J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f 3 analysis showed that this type of intervention can reduce the incidence of ICU-acquired weakness, improve functional capacity, and increase the number of ventilator-free days and the dischargedto-home rate [9] . Notably, an early exercise and mobilization program (from range-of-motion to sit-to-stand and walking exercises, depending on functional status) during periods of daily interruption of sedation increased the number of ventilator-free days and improved functional independence at discharge while decreasing the duration of delirium [10] .",
