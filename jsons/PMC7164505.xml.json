However, the mechanism accountable for the respiratory relief that is normally afforded by a DI is still not clear [7,9]. Several mechanisms are likely involved and each mechanism may contribute to various extents in different individuals. However, one mechanism that arguably received the most attention is the transient change of length (i.e., strain or stretch) that airway smooth muscle (ASM) undergoes during the DI [10\u201348].",

The increase in caliber during a DI results from increasing radial stress that stems from the tethering force of the lung parenchyma. Since ASM is embedded within the airway wall in an orientation that is nearly orthogonal to the long axis of the airways [97,98], an increase in airway caliber necessarily implies that ASM is transiently elongated.",

This is because in vitro experiments can specifically control or monitor the length of ASM. Several types of ASM preparations derived from resected or postmortem lung specimens are used to study ASM mechanics. They include rings, spirals and segments of bronchi; strips and segments of tracheas; precision cut lung slices; and strips of lung parenchyma. Our understanding of ASM mechanics evolves quickly due to the use of these in vitro preparations. They can truly address questions that would otherwise be impossible to investigate in vivo. Nowadays, the tools to study ASM mechanics in vitro can recreate the dynamic lung movements that occur during breathing maneuvers [10\u201348]. They thus emulate the in vivo environment within which ASM normally resides and operates. This was a steppingstone in the field of ASM mechanics. It has provided instrumental insights regarding the response of ASM to stress and strain.",

This effect is certainly relevant to the bronchodilator effect of a DI. However, the reported in vitro results are also plagued with a lack of consistency. The main concern relates to the size of the effect, i.e., the magnitude by which strain decreases the contractile capacity of ASM. However, the discrepancies go as far as being contradictory, as some studies reported that strain increases both airway responsiveness in vivo [99\u2013101] and the contractile capacity of ASM in vitro [102]. The controversy also extends to studies performed with isolated ASM cells, where it was shown that strain can both decrease and increase surrogates for ASM contractility [31,103\u2013107]. All together, these findings are conducive to alternative conclusions regarding the potential contribution of ASM strain to the bronchodilator effect of DI.",

I attempted, based on published studies on human subjects in vivo, to determine the physiological range of strains that ASM undergoes in vivo during a DI from functional residual capacity (FRC) to total lung capacity (TLC). The first section describes the methods that can be used to estimate ASM strain. The second section discusses the limitations associated with those methods and to which extent they may affect the accuracy of the reported strain.

The change in VD from one lung volume to the other then allows estimation of the strain undergone by the airway tree during such an excursion of lung volume (Table 1). The measurement relies on the fact that the last part of the inspired air in a breath does not reach the zone of gas-exchanging units. That last part is rather contained in the VD (also called the dead space), which includes the upper airways down to the terminal bronchi. Since air in the VD does not mix with the alveolar gas, the composition of gas at the mouth during an expiration suddenly changes when it transitions from the air that was contained in the VD to the air that was contained in the alveolar space. The volume of air that comes out of the lungs before this transition of air composition is VD. Because diffusion inevitably occurs at the boundary between VD and alveolar volume, and that the amount of diffusion is time-dependent, appropriate timing during the respiratory maneuver is essential to obtain an accurate measure of VD.",

Alternatively, some have used CO2 as the tracer gas to estimate VD [57]. Johns and coworkers have demonstrated that a breath-by-breath analysis of VD is possible using CO2 as the tracer [67]. By progressively changing the lung volume, one can then obtain a slope of the relationship between VD and end-inspiratory lung volume. This slope has been abbreviated \u0394VD and has been used to assess airway distensibility (i.e., the ease by which the airways dilate in response to increasing lung volume) [67]. \u0394VD is advantageous because it can be measured quickly in a noninvasive manner.",

Raw(pleth) truly represents the resistance attributed to the viscous flow of air passing through the airways. The practical and theoretical principles involved were previously expatiated [113]. Briefly, the subject is enclosed in a hermetic box of known internal volume. The subject is then instructed to pant inside the box into a tube connected to an open shutter and a pneumotachograph. The shutter is then suddenly closed while the subject tries to keep panting. The airflow at the mouth and the pressures at the mouth and inside the box are monitored continuously. The variations of pressure inside the box (\u0394Pbox) when the shutter is open reflect corresponding but opposite changes in alveolar pressure (\u0394Palv). Using the law of Boyle\u2013Mariotte (V1P1 = P2V2), the \u0394Pbox are converted into changes in volume (\u0394Vbox: often called the shift volume). The \u0394Vbox happens to be the mirror image of the changes in thoracic gas volume (TGV) caused by rarefaction and compression of air during the panting, which are required to generate the driving pressure (\u0394Palv) that draws air in-and-out of the lungs. When the shutter is closed, the \u0394Vbox can be related to the changes in alveolar pressure (\u0394Palv), since \u0394Palv are then the same as the changes in mouth pressure. Once the relationships between both airflow/\u0394Vbox (when the shutter is open) and \u0394Palv/\u0394Vbox (when the shutter is closed) are known, the \u0394Palv required to accommodate any chosen airflow (usually 1 L/s) can be determined. The ratio of \u0394Palv/airflow is Raw(pleth). Conveniently, the same panting maneuver and Boyle\u2013Mariotte's law also allow the TGV from which the subject is panting to be measured.",

The subject is instructed to take a DI to TLC and then to expire slowly (sometimes at a controlled rate) while the flow is being interrupted at the mouth for a short period at specified intervals. The flow at the mouth and PL need to be measured simultaneously. PL is measured conventionally using an oesophageal balloon to estimate pleural pressure and to subtract it from airway opening pressure. During the measurement, the change in lung volume is being tracked by integrating flow. This is required to relate punctual changes in PL caused by the interruptions to the lung volumes at which they were measured. The increase in PL caused by the interruption is the driving pressure required to accommodate the airflow (and the lung tissue flow) just preceding the interruption. Since the resistance attributed to tissue flow (sometimes called tissue viscance) is small [114], especially during deflation, the rise in PL caused by the interruption of flow is mainly ascribed to the frictional resistance to airflow within the airway tree. By dividing the increase in PL to the flow at the mouth, airway resistance can then be calculated at every lung volume at which the interruption took place. The change in resistance between FRC and TLC can then be converted to estimate ASM strain the same way it is done for Raw(pleth) (discussed below) (Table 1). The advantage of the interrupted deflation in comparison to the measurement of Raw(pleth) is that the breathing maneuver performed by the subject is much simpler.",

The acoustic reflection technique consists of a sound wave emitted by a loudspeaker that is traveling along the airways where it is reflected and perceived by a recording microphone located on the external device near the subject's mouth. The time gap between the emitted sound and the reflections is a measure of the distance between the microphone and the points within the airway where those reflections come from. The amplitude of the reflections is a proxy of the change in airway cross-sectional areas at those specified airway locations. The greatest advantages of the acoustic reflection technique are that it is noninvasive, nonionizing, and quick. It is also easy for the subject, as no complicated breathing maneuvers are required.",

HRCT is still considered by some the gold standard for imaging the airways. This is because it assesses directly the geometry of individual airways.

A miniature pitot static probe (few centimeters long and 3 mm external diameter) can be inserted into the airway tree to assess airway caliber on the basis of physiological measurements. The probe is positioned at desired heights down the airway tree, which is determined prior the measurements using a bronchoscope. The probe has an opening at the distal end leading to a first catheter coming out at the mouth, which is used to measure impaction pressure (also called total pressure or Ptot). The probe also has side holes that merge into a distinct catheter to measure lateral pressure (Plat). The difference between impaction pressure and lateral pressure is the drop of pressure due to convective acceleration (i.e., the kinetic energy of the gas passing the cross-sectional area). Assuming incompressible air flowing in a tube with a blunt velocity profile, Bernoulli equation can then be used to estimate air velocity (Ptot = Plat + \u03c1V2/2, where \u03c1 is air density and V is velocity). The flow at the pitot static probe can also be calculated from the mouth flow and correcting for difference in air pressure at that location (barometric pressure + plat) using Boyle's law. With this local flow and velocity, one can than calculate the cross-sectional area at the location of the pitot static probe (A = 10 V\u2022/V, where A is area in cm2, V\u2022 is flow in L/s and V is velocity in m/s). Calculating the cumulative expelled volume by integrating the flow at the mouth allows for changes in airway caliber to be related to changes in lung volume. Theoretically, one maneuver would allow the measurement of airway caliber at every lung volume. The greatest advantage of the pitot static probe is thus to follow the kinetics of change in airway caliber. The insertion of an esophageal balloon as a proxy of pleural pressure (Ppl) can also provide additional insights. For example, by relating airway caliber to transmural pressure (Ptm, which is Plat-Ppl), airway compliance (Caw) can be obtained.",

Several limitations are associated with this method. Of special concern is the instability of the probe during the maneuver. The plugging of the end and side holes by mucus and secretions is also common. Maximal reproducible efforts are also required, which can be demanding for the subject.

[125]). The most common devices force air directly into the subject's mouth and the resulting flow and pressure within the mouth are used to calculate impedance (input impedance). The motion of air imposed by the device can also take different shapes, but sinusoidal forcing at one or several simultaneous frequencies are often used. During the measurement, the subject is usually instructed to keep breathing normally at tidal volume. The forced oscillation is thus simply superimposed on top of the natural motion of air resulting from breathing. The forced oscillation technique (FOT) has gained tremendous momentum in human respiratory research. This is because it provides valuable readouts pertaining to the mechanics of the respiratory system, including respiratory system resistance (Rrs) and reactance (Xrs) at every tested frequencies. These measurements allow one to infer on phenomena as complex as recruitment\u2013derecruitment and airway caliber heterogeneity. One of the greatest advantages of the FOT is its fine time resolution. Because of this fine time resolution, it is possible to measure the kinetics of events happening over a short time-scale, e.g., such as the extent and dynamics of airway dilatation during a DI. Its usefulness is also ascribed to its noninvasiveness, the ease with which it is operated and the very low level of cooperation that is required from the tested subjects.",

It is important to understand that the change in luminal geometry does not represent precisely the change in perimeter occurring at the middle of ASM. Due to the combined thickness of the epithelium, the lamina propria, and the ASM, the extent by which ASM is stretched during a DI is slightly overestimated when the luminal geometry (radius, diameter, perimeter, and cross-sectional area) is used to calculate the change in ASM length (Fig. 1). The size of this effect is more prominent in smaller airways. In fact, the size of this effect increases as the ratio of the perimeter measured at the middle of ASM to the perimeter of the lumen increases. The thickening of the airway wall observed in some respiratory disorders also amplifies the size of this effect (Fig. 1).",

This is because the orientation of ASM within the airway wall varies. Here, I assumed that ASM is arranged in an orthogonal fashion in relation to the long axis of the airways. This assumption is correct for the trachea and the main stem bronchi. However, ASM is oriented differently in smaller airways. The angle of orientation of ASM relative to the long axis of the airways is on average 75 deg [98]. However, this angle is obviously another parameter that is variable from one airway generation to another, as well as from one ASM bundle to another. The implication here is that the strain reported is somewhat overestimated compared to the real strain on the long axis of the ASM bundle. For example, when one assumes a radial airway wall strain (viz., an increase of airway perimeter) of 25% with no longitudinal airway strain (viz., no lengthening of the airway) and an ASM bundle oriented 75 deg off the long axis of the airway, the strain on the long axis of the ASM bundle is 23.5% (Fig. 2). The magnitude by which ASM strain is overestimated depends on how far off the angle of orientation deviates from 90 deg. The reality, however, is that the airway is also strained on its longitudinal axis (this is discussed below). If both the radial strain and the longitudinal strain of the airway increase by 25%, the ASM are then also strained by 25% regardless of the orientation of the ASM bundle in relation to the long axis of the airway (Fig. 2).",

In fact, ASM occupies approximately 1/3 and 2/3 of the total airway wall circumference in the trachea and the main stem bronchi, respectively. The remaining circumference is made up of cartilage. Since the cartilage is stiffer than the ASM, the strain is not distributed homogeneously along the entire circumference of the airway. In reality, near 100% of the change in circumference is taken up by 1/3 to 2/3 of the airway wall; the portion occupied by ASM and free of cartilage. ASM strain during a DI in the trachea and the main stem bronchi may thus be well beyond the one estimated based on the change in airway caliber.",

This is the case for the methods measuring and comparing VD at different lung volumes. To convert a change in volume into radial airway wall strain (or \u223cASM longitudinal strain), an additional step is required. This is because not only the caliber but also the length of the airways fluctuates during breathing maneuvers [128]. The relative extent by which the length of the airways elongate and shorten during breathing maneuvers compared to the extent by which they dilate and narrow have been poorly studied. One can assume that the percentage change is equal in every directions; so that the luminal airway volume expands or shrinks isotropically without changing shape during both inflation and deflation. Some experimental data support this assumption [58,129\u2013131]. Studies showing that \u0394VD is linearly related to \u0394lung volume also support this assumption [64,67]. However, other evidences suggest that it is not always the case [132]. In fact, the accuracy of this assumption seems greatly affected by the starting lung volume and the magnitude of the lung volume excursion [80,84,130]. The strain in one direction relative to the other directions is also likely to vary between airways from different individuals and between airways within the same individual. Regardless, the degree by which the deformation of the airways deviates from isotropy obviously affects the precision with which ASM strain can be estimated by these methods.",

This is an issue for several methods. This vertical displacement is important to consider in order to allocate a change in caliber from FRC to TLC at specific airway locations. Otherwise, erroneous changes are caused by comparing a upper (and larger) part of the airway to a lower part due to lung and airway elongation at TLC. For the acoustic reflection technique, coronal radiographs can be acquired. The radiograph allows the identification of the carina and to subsequently measure its distance from the microphone. The other measured areas can then be allocated to specific airway locations. Since the carina is moving at different locations during a breathing maneuver, several radiographs for monitoring its location at different lung volumes is ideally required. However, this is not always done [62]. It is thus likely that a small variability arises due to a vertical displacement of the airways relative to the recording microphone. To limit this problem, the cross-sectional area is usually averaged over a few centimeter-long segment.",

One may think that an increase in PL should thicken the airway wall, for the same reasons as it increases the length and the perimeter of the airways. However, the materials constituting the airway wall hardly change in volume during a DI compared to the air-filled compartments (i.e., the lumen of the airways and the alveoli). Increasing the length of an airway and its caliber during a DI to TLC should thus exert a tensile stress on the airway wall, which tends to make it thinner. Many CT studies actually reported that the airway wall is thinner at TLC, supporting that the airway wall is compressed in this dimension during a DI [92,94]. This was also shown in cat lobes frozen at different volumes [131], as well as in isolated airways stretched to elongated lengths [133]. Overall, these suggest that the airway wall is stretched in two dimensions and compressed in one dimension during a DI to TLC. The ASM should thus be longer and wider but thinner at TLC. This is different from stretching an ASM bundle in vitro, where it becomes longer but consequently less wide and less thick. Thus, in contrast to in vivo, the ASM in vitro is stretched in only one dimension and compressed in two directions. The effects of varying the orientation and the direction of strain on ASM contractility have been largely overlooked. Only few studies conducted with isolated cells have examined the effect of strain orientation on ASM contractility [31,103\u2013107]. The findings suggest that strain orientation has a major impact on the outcome. To the best of our knowledge, no study has yet investigated the impact of strain orientation and direction, as well as their different combinations, on the contractility of ASM tissues. These studies are clearly warranted.",

However, the extent by which the small airways contribute to the overall signal cannot be quantified. FOT was initially suggested by some to distinguish the small from the large airways. The rationale lies in the traveling distances of the oscillations at different frequencies. While oscillations at low frequencies travel far down into the lungs, the traveling distance of high frequencies are shorter. Therefore, while the low frequencies should probe the entire airway tree, the high frequencies should only probe the large airways. By looking at the frequency-dependence of Rrs, or by using a simpler readout such a R5-19 (which is the subtraction of Rrs at 19 Hz from the Rrs at 5 Hz), it was suggested that the degree of obstruction of the small airways can be deduced. Although this line of reasoning is logical, this is no longer the prevailing belief. First, the penetration depth of the forced oscillations at different frequencies cannot be ascertained. It is thus not sure from how far deep into the lungs the signals used to calculate Rrs at different frequencies emanate. Second, and most importantly, computational models have clearly demonstrated that the frequency-dependence of resistance is particularly sensitive to the pattern of constriction in peripheral airways [136\u2013138]. On one hand, a homogeneous pattern of small airway constriction increases Rrs equally throughout the frequency range. On the other hand, a heterogeneous pattern of small airway constriction increases Rrs way more at low than at high frequencies. Therefore, the frequency-dependence of Rrs (or R5-19) is now considered a readout that is more useful to quantify the degree of airway narrowing heterogeneity in the periphery than to assess the degree of small airway obstruction.",

The measurement requires a certain amount of air to flow in-and-out of the lungs to calculate Raw(pleth). This panting maneuver near TLC is also difficult for the subject. The measurement of RL with the interrupted deflation also required a certain amount of air to evacuate the lungs in order to measure the change of PL caused by the interruption. Therefore, the value at TLC cannot be determined. Holding the breath at TLC during HRCT can also be difficult, especially for older and/or sicker patients. Concerning the pitot probe, the airway caliber at different positions were grouped in volume range (e.g., the caliber between 100% and 80% of FVC). The total strain experienced by ASM may thus have been underestimated because many measurements were not at TLC. Notwithstanding this possibility, the error associated with not assessing airway caliber at TLC compared with near-TLC would be small since the airways are stiffer in that range of lung volume. The variation in transmural pressure may disproportionately exceed the strain on ASM. In fact, submaximal volumes and/or PL are generally sufficient to achieve maximal dilation [130,139].",

This is the case for the whole-body plethysmography, the interrupted deflation, and the FOT. To convert resistance into ASM strain, some arithmetics are needed. The calculation is based on Poiseuille's equation. This equation states that within a tube with a perfect cylindrical geometry in which flow is running in a laminar fashion, airway resistance is inversely proportional to the luminal radius at the fourth power. A change in airway resistance at different lung volumes can thus be converted into ASM strain, as the percent change in radius is the same as the percent change in airway perimeter (viz., \u223cASM length). As aforementioned, the airways also elongate during a DI. According to Poiseuille's equation, resistance to airflow is proportional to the length of the airway. So while the increase in caliber at TLC decreases resistance, the elongation increases resistance. As resistance is related to the radius at the fourth power, the effect of changing caliber largely predominates over the effect of changing the length of the airway. However, the estimation of ASM strain based on measurements of resistance might be slightly underestimated because the increase in airway length is usually not taken into account.",

It is also understood that the flow is not always laminar. The airway tree branches in different directions, contains numerous bifurcations, and many bronchi are bending and exhibit a tapered end. All these elements obviously disturb flow and increase the degree of turbulence. Notwithstanding this complexity, the most accurate computational model of the human lungs is the single-compartment model [140]. This model is merely constituted of a single airway with a perfectly cylindrical geometry that runs into a single elastic compartment. The resistance that stems from the viscous flow of air within the airways in a real airway tree, as well as its response to different interventions, thus seem to be predicted quite precisely just by altering the caliber of a single conducting airway in the modeled lungs. It seems that, sometimes, the gestalt behaves as a simple element. There is thus no reason to treat it differently as such in order to extract information that would otherwise be impossible to infer.",

The excursion of ASM length at these chokepoints during breathing maneuvers can be greatly altered [141]. Chokepoints also obstruct the dynamics of fluid. Consequently, they severely increase resistance without necessarily affecting the caliber along the entire airway. The presence of chokepoints is thus likely to insert inaccuracies in the estimation of ASM strain in methods using measures of resistance. In addition, chokepoints affect the regional transmural pressures, especially during forced maneuvers. While the transmural pressure downstream of the chokepoint increases during expiration (as the luminal pressure increases in the airways and alveoli subtended by the choked airway), it decreases upstream of the chokepoint. The opposite occurs during inspiration. Either way, the transmural pressures are altered. The strain ASM undergoes is thus attended to be affected in these regions. Also, these chokepoints are usually not present at every lung volume. The chokepoint may thus affect resistance at low lung volumes but not at high lung volumes, and thus affect the change measured between two lung volumes. More generally, the entire geometry of the airway tree (not only chokepoints) is likely to change at different lung volumes, which inevitably affects differently the resistance to airflow.",

Consequently, the delta of Rrs from FRC to TLC overestimates ASM strain. This is consistent with Brown and coworkers' study, in which the estimated ASM strain by FOT using Rrs was greater than the one predicted based on delta VD assessed by the single-breath nitrogen washout [73].

The level of inspiration that is achieved/maintained by the subjects during such maneuvers relative to their maximum also contributes to variability [141].

An important procedural confounder is thus related to whether the change in airway caliber is measured during inflationary maneuvers versus deflationary maneuvers. The methods used to estimate ASM strain described in Sec. 2 involve either types of maneuvers. For example, the measurements of RL at different lung volumes with the interrupted deflation are performed during deflation. The pitot static probe also takes the measurement during a forced deflationary maneuver. Contrastingly, the change in cross-sectional area of the airway lumen with the MRI is measured during inflation. This is because the image has to be captured during the flow of hyperpolarized gas (3He or 129Xe) into the conducting airways in order to achieve a better contrast between the airways and the parenchyma. This also implies that the image is not obtained at fixed volumes but rather during a dynamic change in lung volume.",

The timing at which the measurements are made can thus affect the results and should thereby be considered as a confounder. Likewise, some methods used to estimate ASM strain require interferences with the normal pattern of breathing. HRCT, for example, requires breath-holding to assess airway caliber at different lung volumes. The breath-hold usually decreases the bronchodilator effect of a DI [3,144]. However, whether the breath-hold overestimates or underestimates airway wall strain depends: 1\u2013on the relative hysteresis between the airways and the parenchyma; 2\u2014at which lung volume it is measured; and 3\u2014whether the lungs were inflating or deflating before the breath-hold. Regardless, the longer time that is allowed for the airways to settle at a new lung volume is likely to affect its caliber. Consequently, the estimated strain excursion undergone by ASM during such a change in lung volume will also be different compared to the one caused by the same change in volume with no breath-hold. All the other methods using measurements made at static (or quasi-static) lung volumes instead of dynamic lung volumes are likely to be affected by this procedural confounder.",

The most prominent example is the bronchoprotective effect of a DI [146\u2013151]. So a DI, or a series of DIs, prior to a bronchoconstriction elicited by inhaled methacholine, facilitates bronchodilatation induced by a subsequent DI postmethacholine [101]. The time elapsed between the DI premethacholine and the subsequent DI under a bronchoconstricted state also affects its bronchodilator effect [148]. The time spent without DI under bronchoconstriction also affects the excursion of airway caliber during a DI because it increases narrowing [149,152]. The bronchodilator effect of a DI is also not the same after a sequence of DIs than after a single DI [149].

In healthy individuals, the PL at which this plateau occurs increases progressively with increasing airway size [80,84]. This indicates that maximal airway dilation occurs rapidly in small airways during inflation, while the large airways continue to dilate until later on in the maneuver. This is concerning for the methods that use the change in the entire volume of the airway tree in order to estimate the longitudinal strain on ASM. This is because these methods assume that all the airways expand to the same extent.",

In airway generations 0 (trachea) through 5, the curve that describes the relationship between luminal area and PL in every generation is sigmoidal. In fact, most of the change in luminal area occurs within a narrowed range of PL of about 15 cmH2O [85]. Therefore, a limited window exists where changes in PL actually cause changes in airway caliber. This implies that no change in airway caliber occurs at either low and high PL. Contrastingly, in the steeper part of the curve, large changes in caliber occur across a very small range of PL. Similar to the mouse study stated above [156], the specific compliance of the small airways in dogs and sheep are greater than the specific compliance of the lungs in that steeper part of the curve [130,157]. Collectively, these last observations suggest that the starting PL, the maximal PL attained during the DI, and the curve describing the relationship between PL and the caliber of the airways under scrutiny need to be known in order to allocate an exact amount of strain on ASM during a DI.",

Apart from the transpulmonary pressure, the transmural pressure across the wall of any airway is influenced by the stiffness of the surrounding lung parenchyma and the degree of interdependence between the airway and the parenchyma [158]. A more compliant parenchyma may dampen the swing in distending pressure generated by lung inflation and thus limit dilation. A loss of connectivity between the airway and the parenchyma, due to alveolar detachments [159] or geometric decoupling due to thicker adventitia [160], also limits the transmission of pressure across the airway wall. The stiffness of the surrounding parenchyma and the level of interdependence between the airways and the parenchyma are thus biological confounders that are important to consider.",

For example, the extensibility (i.e., the ease by which it is elongated) of extraparenchymal airways, such as the trachea, decreases with age [162]. In contrast, intraparenchymal airways and the parenchyma seem to be more distensible [141]. Indeed, loss of lung elastic recoil was reported with aging [163]. The larger percentage change in caliber of small versus large airways during a change in lung volume also seems to vanish with age, probably due to an increase in lung compliance [141]. Age can thus affect ASM strain during a DI from FRC to TLC due to various reasons. These phenomena may account for the attenuated bronchodilator effect of DI with aging [164] and the lack of bronchoprotective effect of DI in infants [151].",

This seems to be mainly caused by airway remodeling [69,75] but also inflammation [166,167]. Asthmatic patients also tend to exhibit airways of smaller caliber [68,70,85,168]. The sigmoidal curve that describes the relationship between PL and airway caliber is also shifted to the left in asthmatic patients, at least when a bronchodilator (salbutamol) is administered prior to measurements [85]. This suggests that the changes in airway caliber due to breathing maneuvers occur at lower PL in asthma [85]. This may explain why fluctuation of Rrs during tidal breathing is increased in asthma [72]. Interestingly, this increased tidal fluctuation of Rrs also negatively correlates with the bronchodilator effect of DI [72]. This is somewhat logical. By operating at a steeper part of the sigmoidal curve during tidal breathing, less of the total possible strain is available during a DI to TLC. In contrast to asthmatic patients, the lungs of nonasthmatic individuals seem to breath in a range of PL below the one where airway caliber is greatly affected by small changes in PL (based on small tidal fluctuation of Rrs [72]). However, for the same reason, the total possible strain the airways can undergo is still available and may occur during a DI to TLC. The benefit is a greater stretch to ASM and, thus, a commensurately greater bronchodilator effect of DI. Finally, a decline in lung elastic recoil was also reported in long-standing asthma [169\u2013171]. All these phenomena may account for the attenuated bronchodilator effect of DI in asthma [70,72,167, 172\u2013179], as well as its attenuated bronchoprotector effect [150,172,174].",

Lung volume dependence of tracheal cross-sectional area in these patients was calculated to 0.22 cm2/L, compared to almost nil in healthy subjects. Cystic fibrosis patients also demonstrate increased lung compliance [181], which may limit the swing in PL. Therefore, the reported increase in tracheal distensibility may be attributable to flaccidity, as previously reported in older patients with cystic fibrosis, as well as postmortem on isolated tracheas from patients with cystic fibrosis [112]. Bronchiectatic bronchi, which are common in cystic fibrosis patients, are also prone to bronchomalacia. It is important to mention though that the incidence of bronchomalacia is high (70%) in patients with bronchiectasis with or without coexistent lung disorders [182].",

            "text": "Among all the elements that constitute the airway wall, ASM is one that is very special. This tissue is endowed with the ability to quickly adjust the mechanical properties of the airway wall. Greater is its level of activation, stiffer are the airways. In turn, stiffer airways are intuitively expected to expand less in response to a DI. However, this is not always the case. The change in airway caliber caused by a simulated DI is sometimes greater when ASM is activated by methacholine than when it is relaxed by atropine [130]. This is because increasing the level of ASM activation may also cause airway constriction, which affects ASM strain during a DI for at least two reasons. First, it modifies the length of ASM before the DI, which impacts its contractile capacity. More precisely, shortening the length of ASM decreases its contractile capacity [47,189]. Second, airway constriction also changes the positions over which the airways are operating on the pressure\u2013radius curve [142]. Following airway narrowing, the DI thus takes place on a more compliant part of the pressure\u2013radius curve and thereby increases the strain for any given stress [29]. Therefore, while the maximal distention attained by the airway during a DI is certainly limited by the level of ASM activation, the strain excursion may not. These have important implications for in vitro studies that attempt to emulate in vivo situations. For example, it may be appropriate to impose an equivalent level of strain on ASM during a simulated DI with or without spasmogen-induced contraction. However, this simulation only recreates adequately the in vivo situation if the ASM is also adjusted to a shorter starting length in the presence of a spasmogen.",

The intrinsic level of ASM activation should thus be considered a biological confounder. However, some interventions also affect the level of ASM activation, which consequently changes the stiffness of the airway wall and the strain caused by a DI. On one hand, many methods used to estimate ASM strain during a DI intentionally manipulate the level of ASM activation with bronchoactive substances (bronchoconstrictor such as methacholine or bronchodilator such as salbutamol). Some studies are actually designed to dissociate the active contribution of ASM in determining airway wall stiffness from the passive structural components of the airway wall [58,75,166,191]. These studies investigated the response to DIs before and after the activation or the inhibition of ASM. On the other hand, many methods used to estimate ASM strain during a DI unintentionally manipulate the level of ASM activation by utilizing topical or systemic anesthesia. This is the case for aOCT [85]. For these reasons, the level of ASM activation should sometimes be considered a procedural confounder.",

This is the case for bronchial thermoplasty, which is an alternative treatment for severe refractory asthma. It was demonstrated in dogs that bronchial thermoplasty increases airway caliber at any airway pressure from 0 to 30 cmH2O [192]. The change in airway caliber though from 0 to 30 cmH2O was identical pre- versus postbronchial thermoplasty. Based on these observations, geometrical considerations need to be taken into account to understand the impact of bronchial thermoplasty on ASM strain. Airway caliber changes proportionately to the square of airway perimeter (viz., \u223cASM length). The same change in caliber induced by rising the pressure from 0 to 30 cmH2O in an airway starting at a larger caliber implies that ASM strain was attenuated postbronchial thermoplasty. Therefore, the initial (FRC) length of ASM may be greater after bronchial thermoplasty, but the strain ASM undergoes during the DI may be attenuated.",

This transient stretch is important to quantify as it was proposed to contribute to the beneficial effect of DI by decreasing the contractile capacity of ASM. However, it remains unclear to what extent ASM is strained during a DI. Despite this gap in knowledge, the effect of strain on ASM contractility has been tested extensively in vitro. A variable range of strains at different frequencies and for different durations in a variety of ASM preparations have been tested. We came to learn that the dynamic environment in which ASM operates in vivo has the potential to greatly affect its contractile capacity. In general, the in vitro results indicate that the decline in contractile capacity is largely dictated by the amount of strain [11\u201315,17,23,28\u201330], which is consistent with in vivo results in rabbits [24] and humans [3,5,86,139,193,194], as well as with isolated cells [107]. Together, these studies support the hypothesis that the beneficial effect of DI on respiratory mechanics is related to the decrease in the contractility of ASM elicited by the stretch. However, the in vitro results are also variable, sometimes contradictory, and it is still uncertain if the strain required to significantly decrease the contractile capacity of ASM is physiologically attainable [29,33]. Incorporating an appropriate range of strains in these in vitro studies is obviously essential in order to understand the integrated role of ASM in respiratory mechanics.",

Provided that an in vitro study is interested to investigate the regulatory effect of these sighs on ASM contractility, the range of acceptable strains is quite large. This is because beyond all the factors discussed in this review, the size of the breath during a sigh is obviously variable. The strain ASM undergoes during sighs is thus commensurately variable. Any intermediate values of strain occurring between FRC to another higher lung volume anywhere from end-tidal inspiration to TLC can justifiably be used to simulate these spontaneous respiratory motions of the lungs.

The springs represent lung recoil. They are stretched at TLC relative to FRC. The arrow at approximately 2 o'clock is the radius (in mm) of the airway lumen (rL). The arrow at approximately 1 o'clock is the radius up to the middle of the airway smooth muscle layer (rM). The material composing the airway wall was considered inextensible. Notice the thinning of the airway wall when the lungs are inflating to TLC. It this schematic it was assumed that the luminal geometry at FRC was equal between normal and asthmatic. It was further assumed that the DI was increasing luminal radius by 25% in both normal and asthmatic, so that the luminal geometry at TLC was also equal between normal and asthmatic. The schematic demonstrates that a 25% increase of luminal perimeter (PL) only causes a 21.2% increase of the perimeter at the middle of the ASM layer (PM). This effect is further amplified in asthmatic because of a thicker airway wall (25 versus 18.2%). The mathematics is developed in the middle.
