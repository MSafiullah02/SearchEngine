Hence, it is difficult to make an exclusive diagnosis. Methods: Thirty confirmed cases of COVID-19 and forty-three cases of other aetiology or clinically confirmed non-COVID-19 in a general hospital were included. The clinical data including age, sex, exposure history, laboratory parameters and aetiological diagnosis of all patients were collected. Seven positive signs (posterior part/lower lobe predilection, bilateral involvement, rounded GGO, subpleural bandlike GGO, crazy-paving pattern, peripheral distribution, and GGO +/\u2212 consolidation) from significant COVID-19 CT image features and four negative signs (only one lobe involvement, only central distribution, tree-in-bud sign, and bronchial wall thickening) from other non-COVID-19 pneumonia were used. The scoring analysis of CT features was compared between the two groups (COVID-19 and non-COVID-19). Results: Older age, symptoms of diarrhoea, exposure history related to Wuhan, and a lower white blood cell and lymphocyte count were significantly suggestive of COVID-19 rather than non-COVID-19 (p < 0.05). The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of the combined CT image features analysis revealed that the area under the curve (AUC) of the scoring system was 0.854. These cut-off values yielded a sensitivity of 56.67% and a specificity of 95.35% for a score > 4, a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 23.26% for a score > 0, and a sensitivity of 86.67% and a specificity of 67.44% for a score > 2. Conclusions: With a simple and practical scoring system based on CT imaging features, we can make a hierarchical diagnosis of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 with different management suggestions.",

According to the guidelines for COVID-19 (Trial Version 7th) China [1] , confirmed COVID-19 cases need to be referred to a designated hospital while suspected cases need to be quarantined under medical surveillance. The medical care for quarantined patients and isolation for people with whom they have had close contact requires larger public health surveillance and response systems with an enormous medical burden. Chest CT can yield a quick positive result prior to positive real-time fluorescence polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), which is the gold standard for confirming COVID-19 at present [2] but with a notable false negative rate [3] [4] [5] . Although typical and atypical CT image findings are reported in several papers [2, [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] , overlapping CT image features with viral pneumonia and other respiratory diseases also make an exclusion diagnosis difficult. We attempted to develop a simple and practical method to stratify cases requiring different repetition times of RT-PCR to identify highly suspicious cases and highly excluded cases.",

Ground glass opacification was defined as hazy opacity that did not obscure the underlying bronchial and vascular margins; consolidation was defined as opacification with obscuration of bronchial structures and pulmonary vessels [19] (Fig. 1a, b) . A crazy-paving pattern is ground-glass opacity superimposed with lines of reticular patterns [22] (Fig. 1c) . Rounded GGO is a round-shaped GGO in any plane (Fig. 1a) .

            "text": "COVID-19 is a severe and easily transmissible infectious disease spreading all around the world. Chest CT examination plays a vital role in the initial and early diagnosis of COVID-19 [8] . Positive chest CT can be obtained before the initial positive RT-PCR. Given the varied isolation and treatment principles of suspected COVID-19 with epidemic history, it is important to focus on baseline CT findings that radiologists first encounter to differentiate non-COVID-19 from COVID-19 in the patients' first consultation at a general hospital. Although Bai et al. [25] revealed that radiologists were capable of distinguishing COVID-19 from viral pneumonia upon chest CT with high specificity and moderate and varying specificity (24-94%) among 7 different readers from China and the USA, an easily understood and simple method is still urgently needed in epidemic areas, especially areas lacking medical resources and well-trained radiologists. Compared with non-COVID-19 patients, COVID-19 patients are more likely to present with some CT image features according to previous studies. We have summarized the 7 most common imaging features in COVID-19 patients as a positive score point. All of the positive score points assessed in our study were significantly different between the two groups, except for GGO with or without consolidation. GGO can result from the pathology of alveolar damage filling with blood, pus, water or cells [9, 26] in viral infections, including COVID-19, and bacterial infections. GGO with or without consolidation is to some extent related to the different course of the disease. However, consolidation would be increased in the progressive stage (5-8 days) [10] . To reduce interference by consolidation, our study confined the cohort to within 7 days after onset of symptoms. The small COVID-19 virus, 60-140 nm in diameter [1] , could go straight to the terminal alveoli, reasonably favouring peripheral distribution while other, much larger pathogens would not pass through the alveolar pores easily. The 'crazy-paving' pattern results from thickening of the interlobular septa, and it can be seen primarily in any airspace, interstitial, or mixed disease [27] . Rounded GGO as well as subpleural bandlike GGO are very conspicuous and characteristic signs at the first glance on examination of the COVID-19 CT images. Although there was no explanation for these two signs, they could be easily detected; we used them as our positive scoring points.",

Meanwhile, single-lobe infection has been reported in some cases of community-acquired pneumonia [28] . Some progressive COVID-19 cases may affect the central area from the peripheral lung [15] . An image showing only central (peribronchovascular) distribution indicates distal small airway wall destruction or peribronchovacular infection, which is similar to the reason for the tree-in-bud pattern. The pathogenesis of bronchial wall thickening can be inflammatory damage of the bronchial wall, which may serve as a potential indicator for bacterial pneumonia [29] , resulting in the destruction of bronchial wall structure and proliferation of fibrous tissue fibrosis [19] . It is more likely to present in severe COVID-19 patients but rarely in ordinary patients at the early stage.

[30] in Japan with simpler criteria and moderate-to-excellent inter-reader concordance. Their study proposed a statistically proven powerful tool for triaging patients based on positive COVID-19 image features while ours added some negative values. Using a score > 4 as a cut-off, our scoring system showed a high specificity of 95.35% (95%CI: 84.2 to 99.4%) and made only 2 false-positive diagnoses (false-positive rate: 4.65%); a score > 4 could be strongly suspected for COVID-19. For suspected cases with a score > 4, even negative results were shown several times by RT-PCR; hence, we still suggest that repeat RT-PCR testing is necessary. If using a score > 0 as the diagnostic cut-off, the sensitivity is 100% with no false-negative (0%) diagnoses of COVID-19; thus cases with scores \u22640 are less likely to be COVID-19. We can exclude COVID-19 in these cases with more confidence and reduce the testing by RT-PCR. Patients with scores of 0-4 should be classified as suspected COVID-19 and be quarantined under medical surveillance followed by at least two RT-PCR tests according to the suggestion of the newest edition of guidelines.",

First, the analysis in our study was limited to one general hospital, but all cases had fulfilled the suspected COVID-19 criteria with exposure history, respiratory symptoms and normal or decreased white blood cell and lymphocyte counts. Our criteria might have missed rare cases with normal chest CT and negative RT-PCR at the first consultation. Second, with a small number of confirmed cases, we cannot set another group to verify the reliability of the scoring system. Future studies including more confirmed patients and multicentre studies would optimize the practical applicability of the scoring system and enable the verification of its reliability.",
