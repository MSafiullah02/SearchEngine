Endoscopic diagnosis and treatment constitute an irreplaceable part in the handling of severe COVID-19 cases. Endoscopes, as reusable precision instruments with complicated structures, require more techniques than other medical devices in cleaning, disinfection, sterilization, and other reprocessing procedures. From 2016 to 2019, health care-acquired infection caused by improper endoscope reprocessing has always been among the top 5 on the list of top 10 health technology hazards issued by the Emergency Care Research Institute. Considering the highly infective nature of COVID-19 and the potential aerosol contamination therefrom, it is of pivotal significance to ensure that endoscopes are strictly reprocessed between uses. In accordance with the national standard \"Regulation for Cleaning and Disinfection Technique of Flexible Endoscope (WS507-2016),\" we improved the workflow of endoscope reprocessing including the selection of chemicals in an effort to ensure quality control throughout the clinical management towards COVID-19 patients. Based on the experience we attained from the 12 severe COVID-19 cases in our hospital who underwent endoscopy 23 times in total, the article provides an improved version of endoscopic reprocessing guidelines for bedside endoscopic diagnosis and treatment on COVID-19 patients for reference.",

            "text": "In Dec. 2019, a new type of pneumonia, named coronavirus disease 2019 later, was first reported in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. As the outbreak evolved, the number of infected cases surged ahead nationwide and overseas (Wu et al., 2020) . As of Apr. 3, 2020, a total of 82 802 patients have been diagnosed in China, with 3331 deaths and a fatality rate of 4.0%. Real-time data indicate that 26.8% of the currently existing confirmed cases are in severe condition, usually with dyspnea and/or hypoxemia one or two weeks after onset (Huang et al., 2020) . Severe COVID-19 cases, mostly elderly people with underlying diseases, suffered from difficulty in eating with a high risk of regurgitation and aspiration. The hypercatabolic state caused by the disease could lead to declined physical functioning and weakened immunity. The stress condition as well as drug-derived factors could induce stress ulcers and even lifethreatening gastrointestinal bleeding, which should be highlighted in the diagnosis and treatment of severe cases. Therefore, in addition to symptomatic treatment, it is essential to strengthen nutritional support and prevent such complications. Endoscopic diagnosis and treatment (including placement of jejunal nutrition tubes and emergency endoscopic treatment of gastrointestinal bleeding) serve as an indispensable part in the management of severe COVID-19 cases. This contributes to a better prognosis and treatment (Gu et al., 2019; Lou et al., 2019) . Endoscopes, as reusable precision instruments with complicated structures, require more techniques than other medical devices in cleaning, disinfection, sterilization, and other reprocessing procedures. From 2016 to 2019 inclusive, health care-acquired infection caused by improper endoscope reprocessing was among the top 5 on the list of 2019 top 10 health technology hazards issued by the Emergency Care Research Institute (2018).",

Dryness of instrument lumens caused by delayed cleaning could strongly reduce the effectiveness of reprocessing. This could be avoided by bedside pre-processing so as to maintain moisture in lumens during transport. The sooner the pre-processing is done and the shorter the transport period is, the more effective the reprocessing will be. As the COVID-19 is highly infectious, it has been classified by the state as a Class B infectious disease, which should be managed as a Class A one (NHC, 2020a). As the endoscopes could be tainted by viruses and multi-drug resistant bacteria from the saliva of the COVID-19 cases, immediate bedside pre-processing after use should be highlighted in order to prevent cross infection. For bedside pre-processing of such contaminated endoscopes, it is advisable to upgrade the cleaning agents from conventional enzyme agents, which have no disinfecting or sterilizing effects, to peroxyacetic acid. The pre-disinfecting effect of peroxyacetic acid could reduce the risk of infection in subsequent operations.",

(3) After scrubbing, put the lens end into a disposable sterilized plastic bag filled with 0.23% weak alkaline peroxyacetic acid solution (Fig. S1 ). Then seal the two sides of the sealing line from two ends to the center opening. Flush the air and water channels for 10 s each, and suction until the tube is free from dirt under visual inspection. These procedures could effectively prevent aerosol contamination during flushing and suctioning, and greatly reduce the risk of occupational exposure. The suctioning liquid should be upgraded to 0.23% weak alkaline peroxyacetic acid sterilizing powder diluent instead of the conventional enzyme cleaning agents since previous studies have proved that weak alkaline peroxyacetic acid sterilizing powder could not only remove and decompose adherent organics, but also disinfect and sterilize the endoscopes (Gu et al., 2018) .",

We recommend loading the pre-processed endoscope into a transport bag in an oval shape to avoid contamination or unexpected injuries when operators reopen it in the reprocessing area. Put the endoscope transport bag into a double-layer yellow garbage bag and tightly fasten it. Apply 2500 mg/L available chlorine disinfectant to the opening and then place it in a leakproof transport container. Before leaving the ICU room, carefully scrub again the outer surface of the transport container with chlorine-containing disinfection towels under the guidance of the manufacturer's written instructions for use.

This serves as a pre-high-level disinfecting process. The pre-disinfection prior to routine cleaning process could help reduce the risk of contact and aerosol contamination during the following procedures such as air and water flushing, air gun drying, and channel brushing. Previous studies have proved that aerosols are solid particles or liquid droplets that can be suspended in the air for a long time, and by which many types of pathogens can be transmitted (Bakanidze et al., 2010) . Aerosols that carry pathogens may freely float in the air, adhere to equipment surfaces, or be inhaled by health workers, resulting in a higher risk of cross infection. (3) As has been recommended by NHFPC (2017a), after brushing the channels and buttons, inject 0.23% peroxyacetic acid solution into each channel of the endoscope and keep continuous, dynamic flushing for 5 min to ensure that the dirt and debris that have been brushed off can be fully washed away.

Therefore, it is of great clinical significance to place jejunal nutrition tubes in these patients to improve their overall nutritional status, and to perform emergency bedside endoscopic hemostasis when necessary to improve prognosis and reduce mortality. In our hospital, we placed jejunal nutrition tubes in the 12 severe COVID-19 cases and performed endoscopic hemostasis for them. As one of the cases was complicated by lower gastrointestinal bleeding, we relieved the intestinal obstruction and did hemostasis with titanium clips by bedside colonoscopy, which rendered the patient in a relatively stable condition for subsequent treatment. A preliminary assessment of these patients with nutrition tubes showed an improved nutritional status, which requires future follow-up assessment as the disease progresses.",
