The microbiological diagnosis of patients who tested positive for influenza virus infection (thus switched to specific oseltamivir treatment) could have been achieved by flu-targeted specific PCR, which is less expensive. If viruses play a role in sickle cell disease children presenting with acute chest syndrome, [5] they are less frequently observed in adults. The overall vaccination coverage in our cohort was higher than that of other targeted French populations (elderly people, immunocompromised patients, or respiratory insufficiency) [16], [17], [18]. Less than 5% of influenza infections were detected; this could be due to the high flu vaccine coverage (60%). We detected only two pneumococcal pneumonia cases (3.3%), which is less than in community-acquired pneumonia usually reported in immunocompetent adults [7], [14]. This could be related to the conjugate anti-pneumococcal vaccine effectiveness previously administered in 85% of our patients.",

Their detection suggests an acute respiratory tract infection but does not differentiate between upper and lower respiratory tract infection, hence the need to interpret PCR results according to the clinical findings [19], [20]. We documented one pneumonia caused by serogroup 2 L. pneumophila by PCR. Conversely, respiratory carriage of C. pneumoniae is common and can last several months [21]; therefore, the microbiological criteria of C. pneumoniae infection is both a positive PCR and serology [7]. This latter diagnostic definition was not taken into consideration in some previous studies where positive PCR for C. pneumophila was considered sufficient to confirm the diagnosis [3], [22]. This discrepancy may have underestimated the incidence of C. pneumoniae respiratory tract infections in our cohort compared with previous ones [3], [22].",
