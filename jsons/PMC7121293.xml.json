To keep up with demand while driving manufacturing costs down, mammalian cell production expectations are rising every year, with product titers reaching 10 g of protein/L of culture [11]. The high yields obtained today are the result of combined efforts made in improving host cells, expression vectors, screening methods, media optimization, and process development innovations. In this chapter, we outline the common methods applied to mammalian cell line development and describe the typical industrial processes currently used in cell culture and purification for the production of recombinant proteins.

CHO-derived cell lines are the preferred expression systems for biotherapeutic proteins although other systems have been used in the early days of the biologics era such as Sp2/0 and NS0 mouse myelomas, YB2/0 rat myeloma, and baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells. Recently, human-derived cell lines such as PER C6 and CAP were also developed for better posttranslation modification (PTM) and reduced immunogenicity of the biotherapeutic proteins. Numerous CHO-derived lines have been developed since the original Puck line of 1957 and the CHO-K1 cells which were derived over the course of the following 10 years from the same lab [12, 13] for an excellent history on CHO cell lines through the ages. In the 1970s and 1980s, Urlaub and Chasin used the Puck and Siminovitch lab cells to derive CHO-DXB11 and CHO-DG44 respectively. Figure 1 describes a lineage of the most popular CHO-derived cell lines. CHO-DXB11 and CHD-DG44 cell lines are engineered to have single or double knockouts respectively for the dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) gene. Of note is the fact that human tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) was the first marketed biotherapeutic expressed in CHO cells and the CHO-DUXB11 line was used to produce hundreds of kilograms of protein.\n",

MTX inhibits DHFR in the MTX amplification system whereas MSX inhibits GS in the GS system.

In production mode, Cumate is added to the media which inactivates the repressor to allow production of the recombinant protein.

The strong murine or human cytomegalo virus (CMV) promoter is in general use, although the weaker simian virus 40 (SV40) and rouse sarcoma virus (RSV) promoters are also used. In general, the strong promoters are used for expression of genes of interest whereas weak promoters are applied for expression of selection marker genes. Another strong promoter from the highly expressed endogenous housekeeping gene, CHO-EF1\u03b1 (CHEF1) ([19]; ICOS, Bothell, Washington), has been generating CHO cell lines with high production levels. Also, the CR5 cumate inducible promoter has higher expression compared to CMV. The inclusion of a chimeric intron as an enhancer in the primary transcript leads to higher stable expression of recombinant protein through enhanced transport and processing of the mRNA from the nucleus into the cytoplasm where it is translated [20, 21].",

The selection system most commonly used in industry is DHFR or GS, which is present in plasmids when using DHFR-negative or GS-negative host cell lines, such as CHO-DG44 and NS0-GS/CHOK1SV GS Knock out respectively. In the GS systems, a knock-out of endogenous GS is preferred but not necessary as the use of MSX in culture provides selective pressure by inhibiting GS. The use of an internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) element can facilitate the co-expression of selectable markers and protein product when integrated into the genome [22]. This system generates a single transcript accessible to ribosomes at two locations just prior to the start site of each gene. The fact that the selectable marker and the product gene are under the control of a single promoter, which generates one transcript, is likely to improve cell line stability. IRES elements can also be used for the co-expression of multicistronic peptides in a single transcript, which result in expression of multi-peptide proteins such as antibodies.",

Retroviral transduction has a long history for inserting DNA into cells, but use for manufacturing is only now emerging (GPEx\u00ae Gala Biotech, Middleton, WI). The chemical method involves various cationic reagents such as calcium phosphate, and lipids, and polymers. CaPO4 precipitation is the earliest method, but has been surpassed by the more convenient and consistent lipid-based reagents (Lipofectamine, Fugene, Transfectin). Polyethyleneimine (PEI) [29] is a low-cost alternative DNA delivery method. Direct injection by micro-needle [30], magnetofection by magnetic nanoparticles [31], and electroporation [32] are examples of physical methods. The electroporation becomes a method of choice for industrial manufacture cell lines for biotherapeutics because of convenience and no intellectual property protection. Transfection efficiencies can vary from 5 to 100% depending on cell line and DNA delivery method.

The continual adaptation of the recombinant cells to elevated concentrations of methotrexate and methionine sulfoximine results in chromosomal amplification events that increase the DHFR or GS gene copy number, respectively, to overcome the drug resistance. The gene encoding the product of interest is usually co-amplified with the DHFR or GS genes as they are inserted into the genome in the same locations. Ten-fold or greater improvements in expression can be achieved with this amplification system. Gene-amplified cell lines tend to be more unstable.

AlphaScreen\u2122 (Perkin-Elmer, Boston, Massachusetts) is a homogeneous assay that is well suited for high-throughput quantification of protein production. The Guava easyCyte (EMD Millipore) microcapillary flow cytometer economically and conveniently generates fluorescence-activated cell sorting-like (FACS) expression profiles of cells with moderate throughput in 96-well microtiter plates. With this approach, clonal populations and cells with the highest average productivity can be identified. Systematic colony picking system from semisolid medium such as ClonePix was developed as an alternative high-throughput method. A critical element of generating stable cell lines is identifying clonal populations of expressing cells. Pools of expressing cells tend to express lower levels of desired protein; they can drift to lower expression levels, and are more difficult to adapt to serum-free suspension. Limited dilution methods have been used for years while FACS sorting of live cells has also proven successful. FACS can be used to simultaneously clone and enrich for the highest expressing cells [38]. Recent automated approaches for identifying clones include picking high-expressing colonies in semisolid media using ClonePix\u2122 (Molecular Devices, New Milton, UK), Pickolo\u2122 (Scirobotics, Kfar Saba Israel) and enriching for high-expressing cells by Laser-Enabled Analysis and Processing (LEAP\u2122, Inrexon). Recently, assurance of monoclonality of the manufacture cell lines is drawn into regulatory attention but no regulatory guidance is available. The best way to prove the monoclonality of the cell lines is to image the cell lines during primary screening process in order to demonstrate that the selected cell lines are originated from a single progenitor. The limiting dilution and the FACS-sorting under low cell density plating conditions cannot guarantee the monoclonality of cells and high-resolution imaging of the cells in microplate wells may be required to support the monoclonality. If the ClonePix is applied for screening, at least two rounds of cloning are required for assurance of the monoclonality of the cells. Single cell-based genome sequencing may be used to examine the monoclonality. For example, investigation of the integration sites of genes of interest on genome which is unique to each single cell may be able to determine the monoclonality of the cells.",

The DCB is used for the bioprocess development as well as for early material generation. For a small research program, only a small number of frozen vials may be needed. However, to continue to supply a cell line for the manufacture of therapeutic proteins, it is usually best to prepare two-tiered cell banks: a master cell bank (MCB) and working cell banks (WCB).

For example, cell lines can lose their expression and can generate undesired proteins clipped from the product. Therefore, it is critical to characterize the cells to ensure consistency for large-scale production and to guarantee that the properties of the protein derived from the cells are maintained. For a production cell line, an acceptable level of stability of the desired characteristics must be established and a maximum passage number must be defined so that comparison of the cells\u2019 characteristics can be made after low and extensive passages. Tests such as peptide mapping, amino acid sequencing, DNA fingerprinting, and determination of gene copy number and phenotype markers must be conducted to ensure the cells\u2019 genetic stability. In addition, productivity and product quality must be examined to assess the stability of the cell line. A good production cell line should be able to maintain its productivity and product quality through the many generations required to reach the end of large-scale production. In most instances, stability retained for 50 generations will satisfy the rigors of large-scale manufacturing [39]. Conventionally, the cell line stability is assessed by monitoring change of volumetric productivity over extended period of time in culture; if the cell lines maintain their volumetric productivity greater than 70% of the original values, they would be considered stable cell lines. The cell line stability assessment may take up to 2\u20133 months and is a bottleneck for the cell line development timeline. If we are able to predict the cell line stability at early cell line development stage, we can speed up the cell line development timeline. Dorai et al. [40] demonstrated that the unstable cell lines were potentially identified by examining the secondary population peak by flow cytometry after internal staining of the cell lines with fluorescence tagged anti-capture antibody. The causes of instability of production cell lines likely vary but the loss of gene copies and the silence of genes by methylation are two of primary causes well studied.",

One approach is to start with a commercially available SF medium and add necessary nutrients to optimize growth and production for a particular cell type. This approach can shorten the timeline needed for in-house medium development. However, using commercial media has two major drawbacks: (1) commercial SF media are expensive, which can lead to a high cost of goods for large-scale production; (2) the composition of a commercial SF medium is proprietary to the medium company and the buyer will not know its formulation. This makes it difficult to gain full knowledge about how logical changes to it will affect the growth and production characteristics of a cell line. To fully understand the metabolism and characteristics of a cell line, there is no substitute for developing a media de novo.",

            "text": "There are several advantages of utilizing a chemically defined (CD) media, specifically CD media has less lot-to-lot variability compared to media with undefined components, such as hydrolysates [48]. Also, CD media allows the scientist to have more insight into the metabolic state of the cells. For example, the metabolism of short peptides by mammalian cells is not well understood, thus media containing them is not desirable [48]. One of the primary drawbacks of CD media is that most CD media formulations typically do not support cell growth as well as media formulations with undefined components [49]. However, using similar methods to those detailed in the previous section, Ma et al. [48] and Huang et al. [50] were able to overcome this drawback. Huang et al. [50] utilized a rapid screening methodology to test several media components during the latter half of several fed-batch cultures. These experiments were followed by additional rounds of CD optimization experiments using trace metals and vitamins. Huang et al. [50] were able to more than double the specific productivity of the culture and final titer using this optimized formulation. Ma et al. [48] implemented a top-down CD formulation development; starting with an over-rich formulation, which contained over 90 components. Ma et al [48]. systematically removed components or groups of components that did not improve the performance of the culture. The concentrations of amino acids in this simplified formulation were further optimized through the use of spent media analysis. This final optimized formulation improved the culture longevity and decreased lactate accumulation while simultaneously doubling the final titer [48]. The top-down approach implemented by Ma et al. [48] led to a well-defined, robust process however this approach required a substantial investment in both time and resources. A cell culture scientist may not have the wherewithal to attain the optimal cell culture media and feed formulation using a top-down approach and instead will have to implement a more empirical methodology.",

This low level of mixing can result in large concentration gradients of pH, oxygen, and other nutrients. Ozturk [52] demonstrated this experimentally by adding base to a poorly mixed bioreactor. The base was added to the top of the bioreactor, and because of poor mixing, a high pH region was created at the top.

However, due to the design complexity and the difficulty involved in cleaning and sterilizing membrane reactors, membrane aeration has limited utility in large-scale bioreactor systems. Sparger aeration offers high oxygen transfer rates and is widely used in both bench and production-scale bioreactors. Since oxygen is only sparingly soluble in water, a large surface area is needed to maximize diffusion of oxygen into the cell culture media. Frit spargers with micro-pores provide a large surface area for diffusion, but this type of sparger can cause foaming problems at large scale, and frit spargers are not effective removing dissolved carbon dioxide [54, 55]. Traditional large-hole-ring spargers tend to have fewer issues with foaming, remove dissolved carbon dioxide more efficiently, and are easier to clean. Therefore, traditional spargers are often used in production-scale stirred tank bioreactors [54, 56].",

Disposable bioreactors are now commercially available that are based on the use of presterilized plastic bags. There are two primary designs of disposable bioreactors, rocker motion bags and stirred tanks. For the rocker motion bioreactors, a sterile bag is partially filled with cell culture media and is then pressurized with a mixture of carbon dioxide and air. The bag is placed on a platform that rocks back and forth creating waves inside the bag. The wave motion provides sufficient mixing and gas transfer to easily support cell growth of over 20 \u00d7 106 cells/mL [60]. Currently, rocker bags are available in sizes up to 500 L culture volume and have been proven for the Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP) production of human therapeutics. Rocker bioreactors have been primarily used as batch culture for inoculum preparation [61] and transient production; however, internal perfusion filters can be applied, allowing the option of use for high-density perfusion culture. Stirred tank single-use bioreactors are the other major class of disposable bioreactors, and are the most popular type of disposable production bioreactor [62]. Disposable stirred tank bioreactors usually consist of a cylindrical presterilized bag, supported by a stainless-steel shell, with either mechanically or magnetically coupled drive shafts turning axial flow impellers. The bag also contains either a drilled hole or a frit sparger, depending on the vendor, and an apparatus to insert autoclaved pH and DO probes or presterilized optical pH and DO patches. These patches contain a luminescent dye that changes color in proportion to changes in pH or dissolved oxygen. The color shifts of these dyes are detected using an external fluorometer [63, 64]. Disposable bioreactors are available in sizes up to 2000 L and have been shown to give comparable cell culture performance, titer, and product quality as stainless-steel bioreactors [65].",

The cells are separated from the medium using a cell retention device and are returned to the bioreactor. The cell-free medium is collected for later protein purification. There are a variety of cell retention devices available, including spin filters, alternating tangential flow (ATF) filtration, acoustic separators, continuous centrifuges, and gravity settlers. Spin filters and, to a lesser extent, acoustic settlers are the two most commonly used cell retention devices for large-scale perfusion cultures [67], and recently many new perfusion-based large-scale processes are using ATF filtration [68]. Perfusion cultures usually last several weeks, but require a longer time for process optimization, and more effort in bioreactor operation than either batch or fed-batch cultures. The increased effort is primarily due to continuous feeding/harvesting and fouling of the cell retention devices. The cell densities attained in perfusion cultures are usually on the order of 50\u2013100 \u00d7 106 cells/mL [69], and the product titer of the medium, in most cases, is lower than that from fed-batch culture [70]. However, the volumetric productivity is typically ten times greater than that of fed-batch cultures [70]. Since conditioned media is continually removed from the bioreactor, labile proteins can be separated immediately from cell proteases and other components that can cause degradation of the product. Some companies have explored the use of perfusion bioreactors in conjunction with novel purification schemes to create a continuous process, whereby the product is purified immediately after it is produced in the bioreactor [71].",

Several studies have investigated the effects of shear stress on mammalian cells [72\u201375]. Many indicate that the action of the impeller alone does not decrease the viability of suspension-adapted mammalian cells [72, 75, 76]. Some bioprocess engineers in industry have observed a few cell lines that appear to be less robust, and anecdotally might have been damaged by the impeller. However, bubble rupture does cause sufficient hydrodynamic force to kill all the cells attached to the bubble [75]. The effects of bubble rupture can be greatly reduced by the addition of surfactants, such as Pluronic F-68. Pluronic F-68 renders cell to bubble adhesion thermodynamically unfavorable, so the cells do not adhere to bubbles [77]. However, Pluronic F-68 offers very little shear protection; cells rupture at the same level of hydrodynamic force regardless of the Pluronic F-68 concentration [78]. Cells attached to microcarriers, however, are very susceptible to shear stress and can quite easily be removed and killed by the action of the impeller [74].",

Cell lysis occurs at extreme pH; however, even moderate deviations from the optimal pH may be detrimental. Osman et al.

Antibody titers increased when the pH setpoint was reduced from 7.2\u20137.3 to 7.0 [79, 80].

Lactate is a product of glycolysis and lactate accumulation greater than 2 g/L tends to inhibit cell growth and increase glucose and glutamine consumption [81, 82]. Lao and Toth [81] pointed out the difficulty in completely decoupling the effects of lactate accumulation from the effects of increased osmolality (osmolality increases with increasing lactate concentration). For some cell lines, the effects of lactate accumulation can be mitigated by keeping glucose levels low, which can be achieved by optimizing media composition and feeding strategies ([48, 83], respectively). Other nutrient feeding strategies may limit lactate accumulation without limiting the glucose concentration in the culture [84].",

Elevated partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO2) hinders cell growth and protein production [88\u201390]. As with lactate accumulation, the effect of elevated pCO2 is difficult to completely decouple from the effect of elevated osmolality [88, 90]. Generally, one can reduce pCO2 by increasing the volumetric mass-transfer coefficient (kLa), typically by increasing the air sparge rate and/or the agitation rate [91]. Mostafa and Gu [92] were able to reduce pCO2 in a 1000 L culture and nearly double the titer by increasing the sparge rate and using an open pipe instead of a sparger. Table 4 summarizes the effects of shear force, pH deviation, and accumulation of lactate, ammonia, and carbon dioxide on cell culture and lists methods to minimize these effects.\n",

As stated previously, most mammalian cells grow optimally at 37 \u00b0C. However, reducing the temperature set point slows cellular growth rate and metabolism, extends the period of high cell viability, arrests cells in the G0/G1 phase of the cycle, and possibly reduces intracellular protease activity [93\u201396]. By decreasing the temperature to 31\u201333 \u00b0C, the period with high cell viability is extended for several days, leading to higher product titers. Fox et al. [96] and Bollati-Fogolin et al. [93] reaped the benefits of a cooler temperature without excessively extending culture time by shifting from 37 \u00b0C to 32 \u00b0C or 33 \u00b0C, respectively. The temperature shift occurred toward the end of the exponential growth phase of the cultures, approximately 3\u20134 days after inoculation in a batch culture. Different cell lines and culture conditions may have different optimal time points for the temperature shift. However, finding the optimal time point is important and worth investing the time required. Operating cell cultures at a reduced temperature often increases the production of the target protein, but to avoid substantially increasing the culture time, the culture is generally started at 37 \u00b0C, then decreased to 31\u201333 \u00b0C at a predetermined time point based on cell growth.",

            "text": "In general, fed-batch cultures are initially operated in batch mode until a key nutrient(s) is exhausted. Then, a solution containing the nutrient(s) is added to the media. As mentioned in Sect. 4, the feed solution and feeding strategy should be optimized. A common approach is to use partial concentrates (i.e., 10\u00d7) of the basal media as the feed solution; typically, most of the salts found in the basal media are not included in the feed solution. The bioreactor is sampled at regular intervals and when one or more of the key nutrients (usually glucose and/or glutamine) are below a certain concentration, a precise amount of feed solution is added to raise the nutrient concentration to its setpoint. A useful rule for choosing the nutrient setpoint concentrations is that it should provide enough nutrients to support cell growth and product production while avoiding formation of toxic levels of catabolites due to excess feeding. Huang et al. [50] followed this heuristic and fed a concentrated amino acid solution based on the projected uptake rates of the amino acids from their platform processes. Another method is to determine which media components are depleted during the culture and add those particular nutrients to the bioreactor independently [97, 98]. Wong et al. [99] selected glutamine and glucose as key control nutrients, and used two feed solutions (glucose and glutamine solutions) to maintain them at specified concentrations. Using this strategy, they maximized cell viability and density while decreasing accumulation of lactate and other catabolites. Recent advances in proteomics and metabolomics have given researchers additional insight into the internal machinery of CHO cells, and could potentially lead to more targeted approaches to media and feed optimization [100]. Another common approach to nutrient feed optimization relies on the use of non-animal-derived hydrolysates, such as soy, wheat gluten, and yeast [49]. Hydrolysates are undefined, and variability between lots of the same type of hydrolysate is a concern [49]. The use of size exclusion filtration can reduce the lot-to-lot variability of hydrolysates [101]. After a series of optimization experiments, based on statistical design of experiments, Kim and Lee (2009) were able to increase titer by approximately two- to three-fold using a mixture of soy, wheat, and yeast hydrolysates.",

            "text": "In perfusion bioreactors, culture is removed from the bioreactor at certain times. The cells are separated from the conditioned media, the conditioned media is collected, and the cells are returned to the bioreactor. Perfusion bioreactors can be operated in a variety of modes. The simplest mode is to consistently remove a certain amount of conditioned media each day (i.e., one bioreactor volume/day) and replace with fresh media. This mode is relatively easy to control. However, as the cell density increases, the required nutrient level may not be met. Also, the protein product tends to become diluted in the collected supernatant [52, 87]. Another mode of perfusion operation is to remove relatively small volumes of media at a time and replace the volume with a concentrated solution of nutrients. This mode is similar to fed-batch bioreactors. One might think of this as a perfusion/fed-batch hybrid, and like fed-batch bioreactors, considerable effort goes into determining the optimal nutrient setpoint concentrations and the feeding strategy. Sophisticated analysis and control schemes have been developed for this type of perfusion bioreactor [102, 103]. A third mode of perfusion bioreactor operation attempts to maintain a pseudo-steady state cell density, after an initial growth period. Dowd et al. [57] employed an online cell density meter and was able to maintain a relatively constant cell density by altering the perfusion rate \u2013 the amount of media removed from the bioreactor. This mode of perfusion reduces the frequency of sampling and analysis required to maintain a set nutrient concentration, but requires a well-characterized online cell density probe and a well-calibrated pump control scheme. Warikoo et al. [71] also employed an online, capacitance-based biomass probe to maintain a pseudo-steady state cell density, but achieved the steady-state condition by keeping the perfusion rate constant while implementing an automated cell bleed. In other words, Warikoo et al. [71] would automatically discard a small amount of cell culture to maintain a predefined cell concentration.",

It is generally accepted that mammalian cell-derived products should be controlled to contain less than one retrovirus particle per million doses. To meet the virus safety requirement by the regulatory agencies, the purification processes need to demonstrate sufficient built-in virus clearance capacity with orthogonal clearance mechanisms. Three complementary virus clearance mechanisms are generally designed into the purification processes: (1) virus inactivation by low-pH or detergent exposure; (2) virus removal through differential binding in chromatography; (3) virus removal through size-exclusion by nanofiltration. Since most viruses are bigger than 20 nm in size, a nanofilter with 20 nm cutoff is usually used for viral filtration. The common brands of nanofilters include Planova (Asahi-Kasei), Viresolve (Millipore), Ultipor (Pall), and Virosart (Sartorious).",

Fouling is often caused by the presence of high molecular weight species such as protein aggregates and can be significantly reduced using a 0.1\u20130.2 \u03bcm prefilter before the nanofilter. For some hydrophobic mAbs, fouling can be caused by inappropriate pH and salt concentrations [121]. It has been observed that some hydrophobic mAbs cannot pass through 20 nm viral filter at pH above 5 or conductivity above 15 mS/cm. Light scattering analysis has confirmed that these mAbs had increased hydrodynamic radius close to the pore size of the viral filter at neutral pH and above physical saline concentration. The underlining mechanism is reversible self-association, since these mAbs can pass through the same size of the viral filter after lowering the load pH to 4 and the salt concentration to below 50 mM. Lower pH renders the mAbs more positively charged thereby suppressing self-association. On the other hand, higher salt concentration can enhance hydrophobic interaction thereby promoting self-association.",

Buffer exchange is achieved using a diafiltration mode in which the buffer of the final desired composition is added to the retentate system at the same rate in which filtrate is removed thereby maintaining a constant retentate volume. Ultrafiltration is normally carried out in tangential flow filtration mode, in which fluid passes across the filter (cross-flow), tangential to the plane of the filter surface, resulting in higher throughput than normal flow filtration mode.

Equally complicated as upstream processes, scale-up of downstream processes requires more than simply increasing the size and volume of the laboratory equipment. The use of larger piping dimensions, larger filters, different types of pumps, and larger dead volumes can introduce variation to the large-scale process.

The scale-up of chromatography operations is usually achieved by increasing the column diameter but maintaining the resin bed height and linear flow rate. This ensures that the residence time is kept the same at all scales of operations. However, linear scale-up of the chromatography column to the manufacturing scale is not always practical for the existing manufacturing facility capability and can often be cost prohibitive. Therefore, to reduce the column resin cost and prevent other issues associated with larger-sized columns such as potential column pressure increase and poor column packing homogeneity, multiple-cycle runs with appropriately sized smaller columns for each column chromatography step are often performed at manufacturing scales. However, the number of cycles for each unit operation is limited by the total downstream process time, which should be the same or shorter than the upstream cell culture process time.",

It is risky to directly apply the process conditions developed at lab scale to the manufacturing scale that is often 10,000-fold greater. Therefore, a multiple-step scale-up evaluation is required. The manufacturing column sizes are chosen with consideration of the cost of the resins, resin dynamic binding capacity, flow rate limitation of the purification skid, and number of the cycles for each unit operation. Once the manufacturing column size is determined, a column size at 10 to 50-fold smaller scale can be chosen for the pilot-scale evaluation.
