Within a short span of about 3 months, more than one-third of the world population is under lockdown and the infection has been declared a pandemic. Every day, the number of cases and the number of deaths related to COVID-19 are increasing. The COVID-19 infection has been mainly reported to be associated with respiratory symptoms, with the deaths being attributed to acute respiratory distress syndrome . From this point of view, COVID-19 appears to be a pure medical emergency. Keeping this in mind, across the globe, including India, many hospitals have been converted into COVID-19 hospitals or have opened COVID-19 wards.

The numbers of people affected by the fear of COVID easily surpass those infected with it. We all will agree that the pandemic is going to affect everyone, sooner or later. Further, we all have to follow the lockdown, preventive measures of social distancing; face the fear of possibly getting infected, of infecting others, possible hospitalization, the uncertainty of getting a bed in the hospital at the time of the need, getting a ventilator at the time of the need, possible death, and if dead, a respectful cremation or burial as per our religious affiliations. Thus, compared to the physical health impact, which is likely to be characterized by flu-like symptoms for most, and a small but significant proportion developing severe symptoms and needing intensive care, the general population at large is braving the psycho-social impact of the illness (Asmundson and Taylor, 2020) . Further, given the lockdown, significant socio-economic repercussions can be anticipated, which is again going to lead to a lot of psychological issues (United Nations, Social Impact of COVID-19, 2020) . Similar situations have not been dealt with at this scale in the recent past. The novelty of the situation is perplexing for the lay public and health care workers (HCWs) alike.",

They are worried about their safety and the personal protective equipment (PPEs), duties in the COVID-19 wards, need to be quarantined after the duty, worried about themselves getting infected and spreading the infection to their family members, etc. Further, they are haunted by some of the ethical dilemmas they are going to face, such as, what to do-if they have symptoms (to report or not to report-if they report, they would be considered as someone, who is trying to avoid the duty; on the other hand, if J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f they don't, then what if they end up spreading the infection to others), what are they going to do when they have to prioritize death saving devices, such as ventilators, if the number of patients exceeds the resources Rajkumar, 2020) .Further, the treatment protocols are changing daily and many a time, there is no clear consensus on which medications or strategy to follow. The protocols for managing the COVID-19 positive cases are modified as per the settings and availability of medications/technologies/machinery. The guidelines made in one country do not suit the others and therefore, till now no universal management guidelines have been developed (WHO, 2020 , CDC, 2020 , MOHFW, 2020 .",

Further, these problems are leading to frequent interpersonal issues among the HCWs, between the first-line workers and the administrators, HCWs, and human resource administrators. Literature suggests that \"Every clinician, is also a patient\" . Further, they are facing uncertainties towards the late stage of their admission, with respect to test reports being positive or negative. These people are also going through the psychological issues of anger (who infected me), guilt (spreading the infection to their family members and others), self-stigma, and anticipatory stigma (how are people going to react to them, after they get well). It is also often seen that it is not one person, but often the whole family or multiple members of a family are found positive. Due to this, people, while being in the hospital are also worried about the health of their near and dear ones, are seeing their relatives being put to the life support devices, and are facing the death of their near and dear ones. They are also acting as caregivers for their relatives if they are in hospitals. The family members, who, fortunately, have not been infected, are facing a situation, which is beyond, imagination in a country like India, i.e., your relatives are admitted in the hospital, and you are locked down at home, and cannot do anything beyond providing logistics.",

Data suggests that more than 3,000 HCWs were infected with the virus in China (\"ICN COVID-2019 Update,\" 2020), more than 9,000 in the USA(\"CDC report finds 9,000 health-care workers are infected with coronavirus and 27 have died -The Washington Post,\" 2020) and they constitute about 10% of total infected cases in Italy. It is natural for the HCWs to harbor the fear of infection and its consequences. HCWs world-over are struggling with the fear of, and being infected with COVID-19. Another issue, which is of concern, is violence against HCWs who are involved in providing the services at this crucial time. This is making the HCWs very apprehensive and vulnerable to the negative psychological consequences. Despite education modules, protecting oneself from being J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f infected is always a priority and rightly so. It is necessary to address the concerns of the HCWs at various levels. An MHP can help in easing the worries. The availability of an MHP as part of the COVID-19 unit can help in allaying some of the concerns of the HCWs. In addition, continued support for professional help through tele-facilities can aid in addressing the daily struggles, frustrations, and anxiety that are expected to occur. Various issues of HCWs are listed in Table- The decision-making role which is likely to be imposed on some doctors may be unprecedented, leading to significant discomfort. Protocols regarding triage and allocation of resources should be available to ease functioning. Keeping in mind the expected distress and level of functioning required in the COVID-19 wards/hospitals, it may be necessary for the MHPs to screen HCWs prior to their posting, and consider intervening in vulnerable individuals. As the pandemic is going to continue for some time, it is expected to lead to J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f physician burnout. The MHPs have to screen the HCWs for the same and address the emergent issues. As the pandemic has led to reorganization or is going to lead to reorganization of the services and roles of many people, it is also going to lead to heartburn among people with respect to the administrative roles and importance given to them. This is going to lead to new interpersonal issues, which must be anticipated and solutions must be kept in place so that the morale of the team is maintained.",

Those who are quarantined, especially, at the facilities outside their home are facing an unprecedented situation of social isolation, social disconnectedness, loneliness, anxiety, depression, phobia, fear of getting the infection, etc(Brooks et al., 2020). Further, if they are being tested, they have to face, the uncertainty of the test results. Those who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 infection are getting hospitalized, and rightly so. However, they are facing, similar mental health issues of social isolation, social disconnectedness, loneliness, anxiety, depression, phobia, fear of getting the infection, etc (Brooks et al., 2020). Additionally, they are feeling stigmatized, in the hands of the HCWs, with a reduction in empathy due to the use of PPEs, while being taken care of.",

Of particular importance are HCWs with personality traits, particularly anxious/avoidant and anankastic traits, which can impair their functioning. These individuals can benefit from individual sessions, with a focus on problem-solving through brief psychotherapy sessions.HCWs with obsessive-compulsive symptoms/disorder, whether pre-existing or new-onset can particularly benefit from the presence of an MHP. Mood and substance use disorders may need to be addressed. Nicotine withdrawal in itself can be a significant cause of distress and has to be kept in mind, especially considering the possibility of use with PPEs.Additionally, the MHPs have an important role in boosting the team morale, motivating the team members to continue on the mission, addressing the interpersonal issues among the HCWs, addressing the issues between HCWs and the administrators, teaching self-care skills, maintaining positive thinking. The MHPs can be instrumental in improving mental health as well as addressing new and existing issues in the context of this pandemic. Moreover, the basic communication skills required to address patients with COVID-19 infection are found to be lacking among the already stressed and burnout HCWs. In many scenarios, it has been seen that many doctors who are from different specialties' are being posted in the COVID-19 wards, who might be having minimal patient interaction and resultantly have poor communication skills to allay the patient's anxiety and stress. MHPs can play an important role in teaching communication skills to deal with already aggrieved patients, in teambuilding exercises, by identifying compatible people who can work together or forming teams of members who can complement each other rather than disrupt the work.",

The MHPs should also carry out research to evaluate the newer methods of communication with the patients and their effectiveness.
