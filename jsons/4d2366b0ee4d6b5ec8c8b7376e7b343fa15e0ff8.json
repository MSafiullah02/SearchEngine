These methods are now widely replaced with appropriate DNA-and RNA-based amplification techniques, in particular real time PCR amplification, for the detection of an extended number of agents responsible for acute respiratory infections. Real-time PCR offers rapid results, efficiencies in work flow and a reduced risk of false positive results due to contamination. As a result, better patient management or reduction of unnecessary antibiotic administration will be possible leading to enhanced efficiencies in health care. In applying molecular methods to diagnostic use, the laboratory can optimise its diagnostic strategy by applying a combination of real-time amplification tests for respiratory viruses and the non-viral respiratory bacterial pathogens. However this must be done within a context of resource availability, technical expertise available and clinical utility. It seems certain that molecular microbiology will continue to develop, leading to further applications in diagnostic technology, thereby improving our understanding of disease processes and enhancing our knowledge of the pathogens responsible.",

It is not possible to differentiate with certainty the aetiological agent in an infection based on clinical symptoms alone. In pre-school aged children, for example, illnesses due to respiratory viruses have seasonal variations and differences in the presence of fever and other symptoms, the likelihood of household transmission, and the impact they have in terms of medical visits and disruption to family life. But none of these features in isolation or combination is sufficiently specific to link illness to a pathogen with certainty.",

Laboratory confirmation of the cause of infections has been made more sensitive and rapid through the use of PCR technology. PCR has taught us that the constellation and severity of symptoms can cluster with particular infectious agents. For example, recent findings from the New Vaccine Surveillance Network in the United States show that despite respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza viruses (PIVs), and human coronaviruses (HCoVs) all being common in early childhood; RSV and PIVs are more common causes of hospital admission with acute febrile and respiratory illness than HCoVs [33, 41] . Despite such clustering, in individual illnesses it can be said that even viruses more typically associated with severe childhood illness can cause milder symptoms, modified by immune or possibly genetic factors, and that severe disease, whilst more commonly caused by a small group of well-studied viruses, can result from infection due to any virus. Viruses that are typically considered to cause infrequent or mild disease, such as influenza C virus and PIV-4, may cause more significant illness in vulnerable populations, including the young and immunocompromised.",

Testing for new viruses along with known viruses, including rhinoviruses [6] by PCR, is filling the diagnostic void in respiratory illness and infection, and has improved our understanding of the epidemiology of such illnesses. In all but tropical climates there are a group of respiratory viruses that occur more frequently in the non-summer months, often peaking in winter; these viruses include influenza viruses, RSV, human metapneumovirus (HMPV), PIVs, and HCoVs ( Fig. 5.2 ). Human rhinoviruses (HRVs) are the most commonly identified group of viruses in both community-managed and more severe respiratory illness in children and older age-groups, having a year round presence but being more common in the spring and autumn months [6] . Whilst it is clear rhinoviruses are a major pathogenic group, there is still uncertainty about the predictive value of a positive molecular test for a picornavirus, particularly from children.

The situation has fortunately been substantially improved lately, but the leading cause of serious respiratory illness in young children is respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), the agent of infantile bronchiolitis, which is associated with substantial morbidity and mortality [21] . Parainfluenza viruses (PIV-1, PIV-2 and PIV-3), especially PIV-3, are second in incidence immediately after RSV. All children by the age of 2 years have had at least one episode of PIV and/or RSV illness. In addition, both viruses can cause severe disease in the elderly, especially in patients with a chronic respiratory or cardiac condition [18] . Although the disease burden due to these pathogens has not been accurately quantified in developing countries, extrapolation from known figures in industrialised countries, such as 125,000 reported cases of RSV per year in the USA, leads to the impressive global estimates of 64 million cases and 160,000 deaths per year from RSV infection worldwide. RSV was identified in 15-40% of pneumonia or bronchiolitis cases admitted to hospital in developing countries, followed by influenza viruses, parainfluenza viruses, human metapneumovirus and adenovirus [40] . The elderly also are at risk for severe RSV disease, and 14,000-60,000 RSV-related hospitalisations of the elderly are reported to occur annually in the USA [14] .",

Among other members of the Coronaviridae are human coronaviruses HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43, agents of the common cold. Another recently identified coronavirus is that of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), SARS-CoV, which emerged in southern China in late 2002 and spread in the spring of 2003 to some 30 countries within Asia, Europe and North America.",

At this time, however, it still is not possible to predict which virus is going to eventually cause a pandemic and when it is going to happen, but the preparation of pandemic influenza vaccines is being actively pursued, generating broad new knowledge on how to improve seasonal influenza vaccine immunogenicity.

Available data suggest that dual infections with viral and bacterial pathogens may be quite common, as seen by the fact that, in the industrialized world, epidemics of RSV and/or influenza coincide with epidemics of S.pneumoniae year after year [32] . While influenza virus is the most commonly met pathogen in this context, other respiratory viruses, including RSV, measles virus, parainfluenza viruses, or adenoviruses may also predispose to secondary bacterial infections. Several different bacterial species may be implicated, including H. influenzae, Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus pyogenes, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and, most importantly of all, S. pneumoniae [25] .

Sequence-related issues (discussed in more detail in Chapter 8) are also very relevant to respiratory viruses. Consideration needs to be given to the type of probe used when designing real-time PCR methods for respiratory viruses. The main issue is that respiratory viruses, particularly the RNA viruses, show considerable genetic variation. For this reason, it is often difficult to identify a sufficiently large and conserved region to accommodate two hybridisation probes and so the single-probe TaqMan format is more commonly utilised for respiratory virus detection. On the other hand, we have also observed problems using the smaller minor-groove binder (MGB) TaqMan probes. The issue stems from MGB TaqMan probes being more susceptible to single nucleotide polymorphisms than standard TaqMan probes. For example, we have found that some RSV strains provided poor fluorescent signal, barely above the background negative signal, in an RSV MGB assay [42] .",
