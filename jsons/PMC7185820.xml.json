The pathogenesis of this disease frequently involves viral infections.1 Amongst the viral causes of acute myocarditis, human parainfluenza virus (HPIV) infection as an aetiology is rare with only four cases reported in the literature.2, 3, 4, 5 Two cases of myocarditis associated with HPIV infection were diagnosed by a rise in paired serology2 and a positive viral culture on throat swab.4 A recent report of HPIV myocarditis demonstrated the presence of HPIV-3 ribonucleic acid (RNA) on nasopharyngeal swab, pericardial fluid and cardiac tissue.3 All of these cases however, were diagnosed retrospectively and the aetiological information did not influence case management. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to report a case of HPIV-2 myocarditis with documented viraemia and clearance of viraemia following treatment with intravenous (IV) ribavirin and immunoglobulin (IVIG).",

He had a dry cough without fever 2 weeks prior to admission. On admission he was afebrile, normotensive but tachycardic and had oxygen saturations of 96% while breathing room air. Physical examination revealed signs consistent with cardiac failure. Full blood count revealed a mild leukocytosis (white cell count 12.4 \u00d7 109/L, 73% neutrophils, 20% lymphocytes and 7% monocytes) and thrombocytosis (591 \u00d7 109/L). His C-reactive protein was marginally elevated (17.3 mg/L) and procalcitonin level was normal. He was in acute renal failure with an elevated creatinine of 155 mmol/L. The cardiac enzymes, creatine kinase (CK), creatine kinase-MB fraction (CK-MB) and troponin I were all elevated at 847 U/L, 48.8 U/L and 2.22 \u03bcg/L, respectively. Transthoracic echography showed a reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of only 15% with global hypokinesia. A presumptive diagnosis of viral myocarditis was made.",

Further tests to elucidate a possible infective aetiology for his myocarditis included negative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on serum for parvovirus B19, Epstein\u2013Barr virus, herpes simplex virus and human herpes-6 virus (HHV-6). The human immunodeficiency virus screen, cytomegalovirus IgM, brucella and rickettsial serologies were negative, as was stool for enterovirus by PCR testing. A nasopharyngeal swab sent for respiratory virus multiplex PCR was negative for RSV, influenza A and B, metapneumovirus, rhinovirus, coronavirus and adenovirus. It was however positive for HPIV-2 by both Seeplex Respiratory Viral 12 Detection Assay (Seegene, Rockville) and Luminex xTag Respiratory Viral Panel (Luminex Corporation). Primers specific for HPIV-1, 2 and 3 were then designed by the research laboratory under the Program in Emerging Infectious Disease (PEID) from the Duke-NUS Graduate Medical School using complete genomes of each viral serotype downloaded from GenBank and aligned with MAFFT (a multiple sequence program alignment for amino acid or nucleotide sequences) in Geneious Pro version 5.1.4. Forward and reverse primers sequences were designed to target highly conserved regions and produce amplicons of \u223c1\u20132 kb in length. Primers used were: 5\u2032-GCCTACAGGTGGTGGAG-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-GCTTGATGGTCGTCGGCCG-3\u2032 for HPIV 1, 5\u2032-GCCAGCATCCCACCAGGTGTC-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-GCAGAGCGTATTATTGACCG-3\u2032 for HPIV 2, 5\u2032-GGAGGATATTGATCTCAATG-3\u2032 (HPIV3 F) and 5\u2032-GCAACTAGTGATCTCATTGTACTG-3\u2032 for HPIV 3. The PCR reactions were carried out using Pfu UltraTM polymerase. Utilizing these primer sets, the patient's serum also tested positive for HPIV-2 by PCR indicating an ongoing HPIV-2 viraemia (Fig. 2). Sequencing of the 1062 bp product that sits within the V gene showed 98% similarity with other HPIV-2 sequences deposited in the GenBank (accession number JX889247), confirming the aetiology of myocarditis in our patient. Following detection of HPIV-2, the patient was started on oral ribavirin (loading dose of 10 mg/kg on day 1 and 400 mg three times daily on day 2) but switched to IV ribavirin (10 mg/kg 8 hourly) on day 3 for a total duration of 7 days upon receiving the regulatory approval from the Health Sciences Authority of Singapore. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) was given concomitantly at a dose of 0.5 g/kg every other day for 1 week.",

The patient tolerated ribavirin with no evidence of haemolytic anaemia or worsening renal function. A transthoracic echocardiogram was performed 2 weeks after ribavirin treatment showed an improvement of the LVEF to 30%. The post-operative recovery was complicated by bleeding that caused a mediastinal haematoma and thrombosis that caused a transient dysphasic stroke. He also suffered from mediastinitis that required a prolonged course of antibiotic and antifungal therapy. After undergoing 6 months of rehabilitation, he recovered his LVEF to 50% and subsequently underwent successful explantation of the LVAD one year after he first presented with myocarditis.",

Serology for HPIV however, lacks specificity due to cross reactivity directed against the envelope glycoproteins, HN and F proteins of other paramyxoviruses and hence may be difficult to interpret.7 In others, the diagnosis was established by positive immunofluorescence or culturing the virus from throat swabs.4 One case reported isolating viral RNA from a throat swab as well as endomyocardial tissue using molecular techniques.3 In the current report, we identified HPIV-2 by PCR in the nasopharyngeal swab and serum of a patient with acute myocarditis. Histopathological examination of the cardiac tissue also showed features consistent with a viral myocarditis.

Some patients appear to recover spontaneously with only minimal supportive treatment2, 4 while others have required support with ECMO followed by heart transplant.3 Our patient developed cardiac failure requiring inotropic and ECMO support 1 week after developing an influenza-like illness.

Although HPIV viraemia was not tested for at the time of presentation, the presence of persistent myocardial inflammation and the identification of HPIV viraemia 4 weeks into admission suggested ongoing protracted HPIV viraemia. As there are no definitive guidelines on the use of ribavirin or IVIG in HPIV myocarditis, we followed the regime used by Khanna et al. in a case series of haematological patients with RSV respiratory tract infection.11 We demonstrated safety and efficacy for the doses of IV ribavirin (10 mg/kg 8 hourly) and IVIG (0.5 g/kg every other day) used in this case for 7 days. Indeed, the initiation of ribavirin and IVIG in our patient resulted in a prompt resolution of viraemia. There was also improvement in the patient's left ventricular ejection fraction following clearance of viraemia. We do concede, however, that it is difficult to definitively attribute the improvement only to ribavirin or IVIG therapy as there was concomitant placement of the LVAD. Although not tested in our patient, it would have been of interest to check the serological status of the patient in terms of the presence of humoral response to HPIV-2 before IVIG treatment, to ensure that the patient was not suffering from a specific or general form of immunodeficiency.",
