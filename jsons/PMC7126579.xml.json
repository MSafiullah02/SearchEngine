Saint Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan (New York) and Virginia Hospital Center-Arlington activated their emergency operations, becoming vital elements of the organized medical response (Jurkovich 2003, Kirschenbaum et al., 2005). The subsequent anthrax attacks in 2002 demonstrated the need for hospital personnel to know how to safely respond to victims of bioterrorism while maintaining a secure environment for other patients and staff. Likewise, the events following the 2005 Hurricanes Katrina and Rita exposed the necessity of a resilient hospital infrastructure with the sustainability to care for vulnerable populations days following a widespread community disaster.",

The unexpected levee system failure in New Orleans following the passage of Hurricane Katrina required that mothers and newborns be sustained in deteriorating conditions without back-up power, limited food and water, and sometimes insecure settings (Giarratano, Orlando, & Savage, 2008). Through the heroic efforts of many, all mothers and newborns were eventually rescued and survived. Yet the evacuation process was riddled with complications and took more than 4 days to fully accomplish (Orlando, Bernard, & Mathews, 2008). Meanwhile, the surge in mother/newborn services in receiving hospitals, such as Woman's Hospital in Baton Rouge 70 miles northwest of New Orleans, was enormous as they received and stabilized more than 122 infants and high-risk obstetric patients (Spedale, 2006). Emergency preparedness is essential to manage the special needs of hospitalized women and newborns in times of disaster.\n",

This was followed in 2006 with the Pandemic and All-Hazards Preparedness Act (PAHPA). This act set up the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) as the lead agency for coordinating public health and medical emergencies and an assistant secretary for preparedness and response (ASPR) to oversee the Hospital Preparedness Program (HPP). The HPP funding is administrated through state health departments to promote community emergency preparedness where local hospitals partner with state and community agencies to strengthen local responses. Outcomes of the HPP include benchmark initiatives to improve responses such as the National Hospital Available Beds for Emergencies and Disasters (HAvBED) system which includes a bed-tracking system to better measure response capabilities (Cantrill et al., 2005, Sauer et al., 2009). The DHHS is also developing a single national verification system that will improve coordination of volunteers resulting from integration of the Emergency System for Advance Registration of Volunteer Health Professionals and Medical Reserve Corps.",

For the first time hospitals were required to conduct a hazards vulnerability analysis to prioritize and plan responses to incident specific threats that they were likely to face. Hospitals were required to set up an incident command system to be used during an emergency to coordinate the hospital's responses from a central location and authority. In 2008 standards were revised to plan for resilience and assess surge capabilities. Thus hospitals are expected to plan critical resources for at least 96 hours of self-reliance; have plans for management of utilities, safety and security, and communication systems; and prepare staff to focus on teamwork and collaboration in rapidly changing situations (Danna, Bernard, Jones, & Mathews, 2009).",

Mitigation should focus on long-term measures for minimizing or eliminating structural risks such as maintaining compliance with safety and building codes and zoning requirements, ensuring adequate flood levee protection, installing flame-retardant shingles in a fire prone area, as well as focusing on potential nonstructural risks such as legislation that addresses insurance coverage for disasters. In a perinatal hospital setting, mitigation includes identifying additional safe space to which mothers and infants can be relocated (i.e., away from windows, lower floors in case of evacuation) by nurses who are knowledgeable about this patient population.

Lack of adequate preparedness can create an environment of disorganization and anarchy with the potential of increasing injuries and loss of life (WHO & ICN, 2009). For a hospital, an emergency operations plan that is straightforward, comprehensive, simple to implement, and developed in collaboration with government agencies, emergency responders, other health care professionals, and community representatives is an essential component of disaster preparedness (Counts & Prowant, 2001). The emergency operations plan must address such issues as the chain of command; preparing and training hospital staff; activities to reduce the hospital's vulnerability; securing adequate inventory of supplies and equipment; promoting community awareness through collaboration, coordination, and communication methods; testing the plan by conducting drills and exercises, and evaluating drills and exercises to assess the hospital's preparedness capabilities; thereby identifying areas for improvement. The hospital's emergency operations plan must be coordinated with federal, state, and local agencies to ensure alignment and compliance. A strong example is the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's National Incident Management System (NIMS).",

Changes in care would likely include intrapartal nurses assisting women to labor without epidural support or minimal medication if electronic monitoring capabilities are limited, and depending on maternal warmth for neonatal temperature stabilization. In most all situations, breastfeeding would be recommended for infant feeding. All standards of care in obstetrics and neonatal nursing need to be considered in the context of extreme conditions. For example, if continuous electronic fetal monitoring (EFM) is not available, what would be the expectations for maternal/fetal assessment for a woman in normal labor? At what point might nonlicensed personnel or family members be used to monitor or provide basic care for mothers and newborn infants?",

Triage is a skill that combines an assessment of the status and prognosis of the patient with knowledge of the medical resources available for treatment. Advanced practice nurses including nurse midwives, clinical nurse specialists, and nurse practitioners with expertise in advanced assessment of mothers and infants can fill critical disaster response roles in triage, transfer, and discharge (Cole, 2005). A shift to a utilitarian ethical framework necessitates that scarce resources be used to provide immediate care for those most likely to recover without extraordinary means. This also includes deciding which patients have priority for transfer from the disaster area to a full-care facility. These decisions are best made by a designated triage officer or those trained to use established criteria or algorithms to categorize, score, or rank patients based on who will benefit most from immediate emergency care (Qureshi & Veenema, 2007).",

Nurses need to understand the triage decisions made and be prepared to care for patients in this complex situation, using competencies that support worker and patient safety and the basics of airway, breathing, circulation, control of blood loss, and infection control (Gebbie, Peterson, Subbarao, & White, 2009).",

After a disaster, recovery focuses on setting up temporary housing, providing medical care, supplying the public with current information and health and safety education, and implementing counseling programs. Hospitals that reopen postdisaster need to anticipate women and their newborn infants using medical emergency services for routine care due to disrupted clinics and pediatric services in the community. Mental health clinics may need to be expanded to address long-term stress in the community. Hospital-based social services will need referrals for women who lack housing, food and infant supplies, or are in need of day care services. The long-term goal of the recovery phase is to restore the affected area to its previous state as much as possible. This phase involves rebuilding, reemployment, and repairing the infrastructure.
