Although it will always be necessary to translate and validate the observations seen in vitro to the patient or animal, the ability to investigate the role(s) of individual variables free from confounders is paramount toward increasing our understanding of the physiology and their role in disease. Additionally, it is not feasible to conduct certain research in humans because of ethical constraints, yet investigators may still be interested in the physiological response in human tissues; in vitro characterization of human tissue is an acceptable choice.",

            "text": "The technique of tissue culture is generally accepted to have arisen following the experiment of Ross Harrison, around the turn of the twentieth century. In 1907, Harrison began by adapting a previously established bacteriology technique, the \"hanging-drop\" method, to culture a frog neuron. 1 In 1912, Alexis Carrel 2 built upon this work by successfully culturing small tissue samples from an 18-day-old chick embryo heart, thereby becoming the first scientist to propagate mammalian cells in vitro. 3 Carrel's demonstration that cells could be passaged 18 times, remain viable over 3 months, and continue to maintain cardiac rhythm was the first to show that cardiac tissues in vitro could retain normal characteristics for a prolonged period of time. These elegant studies, conceived by Carrel, initiated the modern day art of histoculture as it is now known. 4, 5 Although only a small \"sect\" of researchers embraced early tissue culture as a methodology to investigate the pathogenesis of disease, it is appropriate to describe Carrel as the father of mammalian tissue culture. In fact, Sven Gard, in his presentation speech for the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1954, referred to tissue culture as a \"tissue cult. . . with Carrel as their high priest.\" In that year, Drs. Weller, Enders, and Robbins shared the prize for their work in propagating poliovirus in tissue culture. This work was the first Nobel Prize awarded in medicine and physiology for work accomplished primarily utilizing tissue culture as a methodology.",

            "text": "Primary cell culture involves the isolation of cells from a tissue by disaggregation. Single-cell suspensions from tissues can be completed through either enzymatic digestion of extracellular matrix surrounding the cells -such as with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, trypsin, or collagenase -or mechanical disaggregation. These disaggregation procedures have the disadvantage of possibly injuring cells. If the cells of interest are adherent viable cells, they will be separated from nonviable cells when the medium is changed. Alternatively, viable cells can be separated from nonviable cells before culture by subjecting the single-cell suspension to densitygradient centrifugation (e.g., Hypaque). Primary cells have an advantage of possessing many of the biological properties that they possessed in vivo because they are not transformed. Primary cells, unlike cell lines, are not immortal and have only a finite survival time in culture before becoming senescent. Variant cells, however, as well as those obtained from neoplastic tissue, may proliferate infinitely, thus becoming immortal in vitro. This development will eventually allow the immortal cell to take over the culture and can be thought of as a cell line. In general, primary human cultures will survive for 30-80 passages in vitro, although this number is dependent on cell type, conditions, and possibly other unknown factors. Primary cells are widely used to examine the effects of toxins, infectious agents, or other cellular interactions that would not be feasible in vivo. Primary cells have a disadvantage of being a heterogeneous mixture of cells upon primary isolation, with the type of cell obtained generally a component of the disaggregation method used. The most common contaminant seen following isolation of primary cells are cells of mesenchymal origin (e.g., fibroblasts). However, advances have been made that allow the culture of homogeneous populations of cells. For instance, cell-surface molecules specific for the cells of interest may be tagged with monoclonal antibodies. Techniques such as fluorescence-activated cell sorting or the use of magnetic beads can be utilized to enrich the single-cell suspension for the cell type of interest. Additionally, some investigators have recently exploited unique characteristics of certain cells, such as the presence of P-glycoprotein or multidrug resistance-associated proteins expressed on endothelial cells, to poison other contaminating cells in culture. 7 Another type of primary cell culture are \"primary explants.\" This type of culture is not subjected to a disaggregation procedure as is the primary cell technique described earlier. Therefore, single-cell suspensions do not occur. Briefly, tissue samples are dissected and finely minced. These tissue pieces are then placed onto the surface of a tissue culture plate. Following plating of tissue pieces, cells have been shown to migrate out of the tissue and onto the tissue culture surface. 8 This technique is useful when cells of interest may become damaged or lost in the disaggregation technique described earlier and is often used to culture human bronchial epithelial cells. 9 Cell lines are another useful source of cells to investigate questions in biomedical research. These cells have the advantage of being immortal as opposed to the finite lifespans that primary cells possess. Additionally, they are generally well studied and characterized, leaving few experimental variables to worry about. These cells however, are prone to dedifferentiation, a process by which they lose the phenotypic characteristics of the cell from which they began. Many of the early cell lines were established from tumor tissue and as such possess abnormal growth characteristics. Newer cell lines have been established by molecular techniques such as inserting a telomerase gene into a cell to allow it to replicate infinitely. 10 Because of the phenotypic changes that allow cell lines to replicate infinitely in culture, they are often a first choice for experiments; however, they are also highly criticized in light of their nonnatural phenotype.",

The main advantage to this type of culture is the retention and preservation of the original cell-cell interaction and extracellular architecture. This type of culture may be particularly important when experimental design necessitates the use of an ex vivo system, but researchers still need to retain the original organ architecture to answer questions posed. These types of cultures do not grow rapidly, however, and are therefore not suitable for experiments needing large numbers of a particular cell type. 11 Advantages and Limitations of Tissue Culture Tissue culture has become the penultimate tool of the reductionist biologist. The utilization of tissue culture as a research methodology has allowed investigators to study isolated interactions in its near-normal environment. These experiments by their very nature introduce artifacts; however, they do minimize the number of confounding variables that may affect a particular experiment. For instance, tissue culture allows investigators to determine the effects of one particular treatment on a particular cell type, which would not be feasible in vivo. Additionally, tissue culture models of disease allow investigators to obtain samples and make observations more readily than those done in vivo. However, it is the relative simplicity of experiments done in vitro that allows models of disease or physiology to come under frequent and warranted criticism. These models do not take into consideration the complexity of biological systems. Diminishing possible confounding variables by culturing cells in vitro brings up the constant criticism of how applicable results are because of alterations of the normal cellular environment in vivo. For example, cell-cell interactions in vitro are reduced and unnatural. Moreover, the culture does not contain the normal heterogeneity and three-dimensional architecture that are seen in vivo. This said, however, tissue culture biology has proved to be successful in many ways.",

Through the use of cell culture, investigators were able to determine individual interactions that occurred in the disease process. Investigators have utilized culture models employing microcapillary endothelial cells under flow conditions to understand the role of proinflammatory cytokines in the cytokinesis and emigration of neutrophils in disease. Using a model of pulmonary endothelium under flow conditions allowed investigators to demonstrate the importance of certain proinflammatory cytokines in ARDS. 12 The role of inhaled toxicants in lung injury, and the mechanism(s) by which they cause disease, is another area of investigation that has utilized cell culture. Scientists have developed diverse and unique tissue culture systems that contain air-liquid barriers of lung epithelium and subjected these cells to various gaseous toxicants to determine what occurs following inhalation of various chemicals. Utilizing these types of systems, investigators are able to control the exposure time and other variables that may be difficult when determining inhaled toxicant effects in vivo. Moreover, the use of tissue culture, as opposed to an animal model, allows investigators to observe effects kinetically, without undue changes (e.g., sacrifice) and expense in the experimental model. 12 A tissue culture model also permits an investigator to observe multiple changes in real time, such as cellular integrity, cell signaling and intracellular trafficking, protein expression changes, and oxidant-induced cellular damage. Deciphering each of these changes in an animal model would be extremely difficult; by employing a tissue culture model, researchers are able to tightly control the experimental system while isolating the events of interest. Further examples of how tissue culture models are currently being used to elucidate questions in physiology and disease are discussed later.",

Occasionally, investigators develop new medium types to attain a formulation that optimizes their own experimental conditions. Fetal bovine serum is a common additive to most tissue culture media, although some investigators choose to forgo this additive for more defined supplementation. Additionally, others may choose sera from other sources such as human serum when culturing cells of human origin. Inactivation of complement by heat treating serum for 1 h at 56\u00b0C was initially very popular in tissue culture. However, it has become clear that this treatment may in fact damage some of the proteinaceous growth factors present in the medium, rendering it less effective. Currently, many experts recommend heat inactivation only if the cell type of interest is particularly sensitive to complement. 13 When deciphering if the current culture conditions are sufficient for the experimental design, the investigator must determine which cellular characteristics are important.

Today, many investigators choose to use molecular biology techniques, exploiting our current knowledge of oncogenic viruses and enzymatic processes of cellular aging to transform primary cells in vitro to an immortal phenotype.

Greater understanding of these steps may help to develop new treatment regimes. Currently, treatment of ARDS consists of mechanical ventilation, which helps to stabilize blood gases. However, mechanical ventilation itself may provoke further inflammation in the alveoli, thereby decreasing compliance and gas exchange in the alveoli. 30 The cell type of particular interest in ARDS and diffuse alveolar damage is the type II pneumocyte. [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] Until recently, studies trying to decipher the pathological sequence in acute lung injury have had to rely on standard lung epithelial cell lines. Recently, however, human type II alveolar epithelial cells (pneumocytes) have been successfully isolated from fetal human lung tissue by collagenase digestion. 36 Briefly, fetal lung tissues were minced and incubated in a serum-free medium containing dibutyryl cyclic adenosine monophosphate for 5 days. The tissue explants were then treated with collagenase and incubated with DEAE-dextran to eliminate contaminating fibroblasts. Cells were then plated onto tissue culture dishes treated with extracellular matrix derived from MDCK cells and cultured overnight in Weymouth's medium containing 10% serum. These steps resulted in relatively pure populations of human type II pneumocytes that were then cultured at an air-liquid interface. Using these methods, Alcorn et al 36 were able to maintain a primary culture that retained the morphological and biochemical characteristics of type II pneumocytes for up to 2 weeks.",

            "text": "Conventional Bioreactors and Three-Dimensionality: The Origins of Three-Dimensional Culture Carrel postulated that tissue development was linked to access to nutrient supply, noting that peripheral cells grew readily, and internal cells became necrotic, presumably based on their distance from the nutrient source. To circumvent this issue, Carrel implemented cultures on silk veils, preventing the plasma clots of the growth media from deforming or becoming spherical, thus facilitating the internal cell's ability to obtain nutrient replenishment. Many attempts were made in standard culture systems (bioreactors) and other culture apparatuses to escape the constraints of two-dimensional cell culture, with the intent of yielding high-fidelity human and mammalian tissues, and thus emphasizing the need for development of three-dimensional biology. 2, 3 Another famous researcher, Leighton, improved on Carrel's techniques in the 1950s and 1960s. Leighton's major contribution to three-dimensional culture technology was the introduction of the idea of a sponge matrix as a substrate on which to culture tissues. 37 , 38 Leighton first experimented on cellulose sponges surrounded by plasma clots resident within glass tubes. He devised a system to grow tissue explants 1-5 mm 2 in area on sponges, using small amounts of chick plasma and embryo extract. After the mixture solidified on the sponge, Leighton added the nutrient media and inserted the \"histoculture\" in a roller apparatus to facilitate nutrient mass transfer. He experimented with many sponge combinations, discovering that collagen-impregnated cellulose sponges were optimal for sustaining the growth of native tissue architecture. 4, 39 Leighton was successful in growing many different tissue types on the sponge-matrix cultures. 4, 39 Leighton also found that C3HBA mouse mammary adenocarcinoma cells, when grown on sponge-matrix histoculture, aggregated \"much like the original tumor, forming distinct structures within the tumors such as lumina and stromal elements, and glandular structures.\" An extremely important difference of this threedimensional histoculture from the standard two-dimensional culture is the apparent quiescence of the stromal component and the balanced growth of these cells with regard to the overall culture. Leighton further advanced the concept of three-dimensional histoculture to histophysiological gradient cultures. 40 These cultures are conducted in chambers that allow metabolic exchange between \"the pool of medium and the culture chamber by diffusion across a membrane.\" Histophysiological gradient cultures mimic, to some degree, diffusion in tissues. 39 From the pioneering work of Carrel and Leighton, other methods of emulating three-dimensional cultures have been developed, such as embedding cells and tissues in collagenous gels of rat tail as per the techniques of Nandi and colleagues. Clusters of mammary cells were initiated into cultures, and Nandi and colleagues observed three-dimensional formation of ductile structures and sustained growth over a period of several weeks concordant with proliferation at the edge of the cell mass with minimal fibroblast contamination. 41 Thus, mammary tissue cultured in the collagen gels resembled, histologically, in vivo tissue, differing significantly from two-dimensional monolayer cultures. Nandi et al suggested an important criterion for successful growth of mammary tissue-like structures in collagen gels, versus the monolayer culture, was maintenance of mammary cell shape in three dimensions as opposed to conventional monolayer culture. Many of the advantages of three-dimensional cultures seen by Leighton, Nandi, and others may be attributed to permitting the cells to retain their normal shape and special associations. 4 This global concept will be important as we begin to understand and recall the physical and environmental characteristics of the rotating-wall vessel systems.",

            "text": "The impact of molecular genetic engineering in the early 1980s was for the most part confined to pharmaceutical proteins such as interferon, growth hormones, and insulin molecules. During processing of these valuable, but lowyield, products, emphasis was placed on downstream recovery rather than on bioconversion or bioprocesses, let alone three-dimensional tissue development. Advances in modern biotechnological product recovery are expanding to mediumand high-volume enzyme products and limited forms of bulk products. In the world of high-volume, high-value products, cell culture bioreactor productivity contributes an important role in determining the economic influence of bioprocessing. Ideal bioprocessing bioreactors will in future have high reactor productivity with an in situ separation capability of products. 46 Membrane bioreactors fit this description and already contribute remarkably to the bioprocessing industry. Membrane bioreactors are capable of retaining enzymes, organelles, and microbial, animal, and plant cells behind a membrane barrier, trapped in a matrix or adherent to the membrane surface. In 1963, Gallup and Gerhardt 47 initially used the membrane bioreactor for dialysis culture of Serratia marcescens . Immobilized enzyme microencapsulation was pioneered by Chang, 48 but Butterworth et al 49 first developed the enzyme membrane reactor to successfully accomplish starch hydrolysis with a -amylase. Similarly, for animal cell culturing, Knazek et al 50 cultured human choriocarcinoma cells on compacted bundles of Amicon fibers. Many reviews on the particular applications of hollow-fiber and immobilized bioreactant bioreactors for enzyme catalysts, microbial cells, and animal cell culture are available. 46, [51] [52] [53] [54] [55] Prolonged human residence in microgravity results in the atrophy of healthy skeletal muscle. Continued space exploration requires a better understanding of this phenomenon. 56 Muscle wasting is likely caused by changes at the system level marked by increased circulating glucocorticoids and decreased circulating growth hormone and at local levels as seen by decreased myofiber resting tensions. Differentiated skeletal muscle cultures have served as model systems for gaining a better understanding of the roles of exogenous and endogenous cytokines and of muscle fiber tension in regulating muscle cell growth. This effort has led to the beginning of tissue engineering studies by the space science community. Engineering these tissues into three-dimensional bioartificial muscle (BAM) constructs has extended their utility for space flight investigations as a prelude to developing countermeasures for the microgravity environment. Serendipitously, these bioreactor models in part mimic diseases of the musculature such as dystrophy. 57 BAMs have been sustained in a viable condition for as much as a month in perfused hollow-fiber bioreactor cartridges. 58 Further, investigators have documented 57 that growth hormone and/or insulin-like growth factors are potential protein therapeutics, which may in part attenuate skeletal muscle degeneration in space as well as show promise for the treatment of muscle-wasting diseases of the terrestrial community. 57 An associated application of space bioscience to an Earthbased disease is the investigation of bone degeneration. The microgravity effect on bone decalcification has been documented beginning with early space flights and subsequently found to mimic conditions analogous to osteoporosis frequently seen in aging females. Over the past three decades, the relationship between cellular morphology and metabolism and the role of physical stress in bone loss has been studied. Physiomechanical stresses induce shape changes in osteoblasts, possibly mediated by reorganization of focal contacts. Thus, gravity variations (Gz) have been studied to understand their influence on osteoblast adhesion of ROS 17/2.8 rat osteosarcoma cells during 15-30 parabolic flights. Nontrivial flight-induced cell shape changes consisting of decreased area concordant with contact plaque reordering have been observed; however identical periods of continuous mechanical stress induced by centrifugation (2 Gz) or clinostatic rotation (Gz randomization) had no discernible effect on cell adhesion. Synchronization of ROS 17/2.8 G2/M accomplished via treatment in nocodazole inhibited the flight-induced decreases in adhesion parameters. Investigators thus concluded that ROS 17/2.8 cells possess the ability to sense Gz triggers and that adaptation is related to cytoskeletal function. 59 As presented previously, tissue engineering applications of three-dimensional function and structure are well known in medical science research. 60 In microgravity, three-dimensional aggregates form, facilitating the expression of differentiated organotypic assemblies. Investigations to determine the effect of composite matrices, spiked with esterified hyaluronic acid and gelatin, to augment osteochondral differentiation of cultured, bone marrow-derived mesenchymal progenitor cells, and the effects of the matrix on cellular differentiation have been examined in vitro and in vivo. 60 Briefly, empty and populated matrices cultured for 28 days with and without transforming growth factor (TGF)b 1 demonstrated the following results. Cells implanted in the matrix produced a robust type II collagen extracellular matrix in vitro. Matrices placed in immunodeficient mice yielded no differentiation in empty constructs, osteochondral differentiation in loaded implants, and an enhanced level of differentiation in preimplantation in vitro-cultured matrices containing TGF-b 1. These results demonstrate the utility of a three-dimensional matrix for presentation of bone mesenchymal progenitor cells in vivo for repair of cartilage and bone defects as well as indicate the efficacy for in vitro tissue engineering regimes. 60 These techniques lend themselves to microgravity and ground-based research tissue cultures alike.",

At a concentration of 8 \u00d7 10 6 stromal cells, mineralization occurs in 6 days. In contrast, two-dimensionally oriented marrow fragments at 1 \u00d7 10 7 cells require requires more than 10 days before mineralization can similarly be detected. 61 Two-dimensional long-term marrow culture facilitates and enhances expansion of the stromal component and rudimentary differentiation of osteogenic-like cells in the adherent stromal layer, as verified by type I collagen or cells positive for alkaline phosphatase. Production of osteonectin and osteocalcin, a bone-specific protein, combined with calcification is observed only in three-dimensional cultures. These studies demonstrate the need for and benefit of three-dimensionality and the application to the microgravity environment. 61 As we can see, this further reinforces the quest for three-dimensionality and the potential of modeling the microgravity environment.",

            "text": "The assembly of complex functional mammalian tissues in 1\u00d7 gravity is problematic because of the effects of shear stress, turbulence, and inadequate oxygenation in conventional cell culture systems. This study describes the culture and three-dimensional assembly of baby hamster kidney (BHK) mammalian cells on microcarriers under controlled oxygenation, low shear stress, and turbulence in the NASA-designed integrated rotating-wall vessel (RWV). [62] [63] [64] Anchorage-dependent cells are widely cultured on microcarriers. 65 Studies show that for the purposes of improved surface-to-volume ratio and scale-up, the microcarrier suspension culture provides excellent potential for high-density cell growth. 66 In addition; microcarriers serve well as structural supports for three-dimensional assembly, the composite of which is the basis for three-dimensional tissue growth. 67 Conventional culture systems for microcarrier cultures (i.e., bioreactors) use mechanical agitation to suspend microcarriers and thus induce impeller strikes as well as fluid shear and turbulence at the boundary layer between the wall and the fluid. Investigators have attempted to make a complete study of the most efficient bioreactor designs and agitation regimens. 68 They concluded that virtually all stirred-tank bioreactors operate in the turbulent regimen. It has been demonstrated that bead-to-bead bridging of cells is enhanced significantly at lower agitation rates in a stirred reactor. 69 Aggregates of as many as 12-15 microcarriers bridged with bovine embryonic kidney cells (BEK) have been reported. Excessive agitation from either stirring or gas bubble sparging has been documented as a cause of cell damage in microcarrier cell cultures. 70, 71 To overcome the problems induced by these mechanisms, investigators developed alternative culture techniques such as porous microcarriers to entrap cells, 72 increased viscosity of culture medium, 73 bubble-free oxygenation, 74 and improved methods for quiescent inoculation. 75, 76 These steps decreased the damage attributed to turbulence and shear forces but failed to significantly rectify the problems. Reactor systems of substantially increased volume exhibit less agitation-related cell damage, presumably because of the decreased frequency of cell-microcarrier contact with the agitation devices in the systems. Research-scale investigations do not afford the luxury of experimenting with large-scale production systems. Therefore, if a large-volume system is indeed more quiescent, an improved bioreactor system should emulate the fluid dynamics present in the upper regions of large-scale reactors in which cells and microcarriers reside with minimal agitation. Microcarriers and cells in large-volume reactors are semibuoyant, rendering them practically weightless, a condition that we hypothesize may be analogous to the environment of microgravity. It is stated that \"Unless a cell culture is growing in an environment free of gravitational forces, moderate levels of agitation are required to suspend microcarriers that are not neutrally buoyant.\" 73 The ability to grow cells in a rudimentary horizontally rotated chamber has been previously demonstrated and is intended to simulate in the laboratory the effects of weightlessness or microgravity on cells. It was shown that human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells attach to microcarriers in microgravity (Space Shuttle experiment) and that attachment and spreading may be enhanced in a weightless environment. 77 Review articles of cell biology performed in space flight experiments delineate the growth of many cell types in an environment devoid of gravitational influence. 78 The problem, then, is to suspend microcarriers and cells without inducing turbulence or shear while providing adequate oxygenation and nutritional replenishment. One environment that possesses these attributes is the microgravity of space flight. Another is the system referenced here, which randomizes the forces of gravity by classical methods, thus simulating some aspects of microgravity.",

            "text": "The term rotating-wall vessel (RWV) comprises a family of vessels, batch fed and perfused, that embody the same fluid dynamic operating principles. These principles are (1) solid body rotation about a horizontal axis that is characterized by (a) colocation of particles of different sedimentation rates, (b) extremely low fluid shear stress and turbulence, and (c) three-dimensional spatial freedom; and (2) oxygenation by active or passive diffusion to the exclusion of all but dissolved gasses from the reactor chamber, yielding a vessel devoid of gas bubbles and gas-fluid interface (zero head space) (Fig. 18.3 ) . 79 Chondrocytes from bovine cartilage were inoculated into the RWV with 5 mg/ml Cytodex-3 microcarriers in nonadherent petri dishes with identical conditions and were initiated with microcarriers as standard tissue culture controls. Differentiated chondrocytes were observed in all sections of RWV material through 36 days, while few were observed in the sections of petri dish material.\" 81 These results indicate that the unique conditions provided by the RWV afford access to cellular processes that signify the initiation of differentiation as well as production of normal matrix material. These experiments demonstrated the ability to create a synthetic model of cartilage or bone without leaving Earth's orbit. Increased Actin (alexa 555 phalloidin; red) and nuclear staining (syto16; green) is observed over the time course, resulting in yellowish-red staining by day 34. Goodwin et al 63 describe the results of experiments where normal human small intestine epithelium and mesenchyma were cultured in rotating-wall vessel cultures. They found that the rotatingwall vessels are a major advance toward constructing a functionally accurate, large-scale, in vitro, three-dimensional (3-D) tissue model of the small intestine. Because of the presence of large tissue-like masses that express differentiated epithelial, mesenchymal, and developing endothelial cells, a multitude of possibilities are afforded for cell biological investigations, and further, functional epithelial cell brush borders with extracellular matrix and basal lamina components that represent ordering of tissue and cellular polarity were nurtured by the molecular conditions and physical orientations of the culture system. An important additional finding was that this 3-D model demonstrates a significantly diminished requirement of complex culture media, which suggests specific cell-cell interactions and the production of paracrine and autocrine factors essential to the growth and development of these fragile tissues. 63 The role of basement membranes and extracellular matrix and their relationship to epithelial mesenchymal development and differentiation are the subjects of considerable research. Current studies indicate that the stromal component exerts a strong and driving influence over developing intestinal mucosa. [82] [83] [84] Stallmach et al 85 have shown that only organ-specific mesenchyme will produce differentiation in epithelium from a given organ site and that embryonic mesenchyme of the same age but from different organs was ineffective. Studies of rat small intestine development have detailed a shift in the membrane molecular components of crypt cells as measured by monoclonal antibody binding in fetal versus newborn rat epithelium. Quaroni 86 postulates that the presence of specific markers in the crypts indicates undifferentiated crypt cells, which may be able to perform specific intestinal functions similar to that of the villus cells. Additional information shows that a single fetal epithelial cell type in the last 2-3 days of gestation may express the function of more than one cell, thereby giving rise to DNA synthesis and proliferation. 87 Cocultures of small intestine produced in the RWV were initiated with adult epithelium composed of dividing and terminally differentiated cells and predominantly adult mesenchymal cells with one exception, a 2-month-old female donor. Levels of epithelial cell (keratin-positive) and mesenchymal cell-specific (vimentin-positive) immunostaining decreased slightly but consistently over the course of the RWV experiments, while total numbers of cells increased. Levels of endothelial cell (Factor VIII-positive) and epithelial cell (villin-positive) staining remained reasonably constant, while staining for angioblasts (endothelial precursor cells) developed toward the end of each experiment. Functional brush border markers such as sucrase were also present in this coculture system. Other brush border-specific monoclonal antibodies, kindly supplied by Dr. Andrea Quaroni (Cornell University, Ithaca, NY), have similarly proved positive in more recent studies (unpublished results). Collectively, these results indicate that the model, although not histotypically correct, exhibits many facets of functional normal small intestine. Growth conditions, however, may still be skewed slightly in favor of the mesenchymal versus the epithelial cell types. Work will continue on further definition of the correct nutritional and growth-matrix requirements directed toward attaining the best representation possible. Interestingly, all the RWV cocultures exhibited laminin, fibronectin, and type IV collagen production, as well as large amounts of proteoglycan. Hahn states that only undifferentiated, highly proliferative intestinal epithelial cells (usually fetal) synthesize the aforementioned proteins. 88 Of these, only laminin appeared to promote differentiation of intestinal epithelial cells. Type IV collagen and fibronectin had no effect.",

            "text": "Current cell culture models have shortcomings resulting in unreliable tumor growth, uncharacteristic tumor development, nonhuman tumors, and inadequate methods of detection. Cells propagated under traditional culture conditions differ widely in their expression of differentiated markers, adhesion receptors, and growth factor receptors compared with cells in situ or those grown as tissue-like structures. 90, 91 This factor is of concern because the phenotypic changes leading to malignant transformation often stem from alterations in the balanced and multifaceted roles of growth factors, receptors, and cytokines (reviewed by Herlyn et al 90 . With increasing evidence of the importance of adhesive contacts, paracrine cross-talk between different cell types, and signaling cascades that link the cell with a complex substratum, there is now recognition that models must be developed that better simulate these complexities. There is still much to learn about the dynamic relationships among the different phenotypes found in the normal lung and in lung cancers. Until a cell culture system is developed that allows differentiation to occur, 62 it is difficult to make any conclusive statement about relating effects in cell culture to clinical practice. Tissue engineering is very embryonic in development and currently nearly universally focused on building replacement tissues. A new technology developed at the NASA Johnson Space Center used to study colon cancer has been adapted to three-dimensional in vitro lung tissue culture models but has not been reported on to date. Rotating-wall vessels are horizontally rotating cylindrical tissue culture vessels that provide controlled supplies of oxygen and nutrients with minimal turbulence and extremely low shear. 79 These vessels suspend cells and microcarriers homogeneously in a nutrient-rich environment, which allows the three-dimensional assembly of cells to tissue. Before seeding rotating-wall vessels (Synthecon, Houston, TX, USA), cells were cultured in standard T flasks (Corning, Corning, NY, USA) in GTSF-2 medium (1993 PSEBM) in a humidified 37\u00b0C, 5% CO 2 incubator. The rotating-wall vessels were seeded with 1-2 mg/ml Cultispher-GL microcarriers (Hyclone Laboratories, Logan, UT, USA) followed by BEAS2-B or BZR-T33 cells (ATCC, Baltimore, MD, USA) at a density of 2 \u00d7 10 5 cells/ml. Cultures were grown in the rotating-wall vessels for 14-21 days for formation of 3-to 5-mm-diameter tumor masses. Rotating-wall vessel rotation was initiated at 25 rpm and increased as aggregate size became larger. Stationary control cultures were initiated under the same conditions using FEP Teflon bags (Ameri-can Fluoroseal, Columbia, MD, USA). At 24-h intervals pH, dissolved CO 2 , and dissolved O 2 were determined using a Corning 238 model clinical blood gas analyzer. Glucose concentration was determined using a clinical glucose analyzer. Cell samples were harvested every 48 h and fixed for immunohistochemistry or for scanning electron microscopy.",

            "text": "Cancer models already developed by NASA investigators include growth and differentiation of an ovarian tumor cell line, 62, 92, 93 growth of colon carcinoma lines, 62 and threedimensional aggregate and microvillus formation in a human bladder carcinoma cell line. 93 In support as an appropriate model for cancer, even the most rudimentary threedimensional cellular structures exhibit different phenotypes than cell lines cultured under two-dimensional conditions. Properties such as responses to TGF-b , drug resistance to cisplatin or cyclophosphamide, and resistance to apoptosis are all altered in various types of cell aggregates. 94 Many investigations sustain consistent evidence that cells growing in three-dimensional arrays appear more resistant to cytotoxic chemoagents than cells in monolayer culture. 39 Li et al 95 found that spheroids were more resistant to cytosine arabinoside by 11-fold and methotrexate by 125-fold when compared with single-cell suspensions. Further monolayer cultures of colon carcinoma cells were sensitive to piericidin C in contrast to responses within in vivo colon tumors or three-dimensional slices of tumors grown in vitro. 96 Numerous other investigations have revealed increased levels of drug resistance of spheroids compared with single-cell monolayers. 4, 39 Questions of poor diffusion and insufficient drug absorption within spheroids and a relatively frequent high proportion of resting cells have clouded differences in drug resistance, which could be the result of nutrient deprivation and hypoxia. Heppner and colleagues executed precise experiments that confirmed three-dimensional structure and function as the causative agent which was responsible for drug resistance rather than simple inaccessibility to nutrients or the drug concentration. Heppner embedded tumor specimens or cell aggregates in collagen gels, exposed the culture to various cytotoxic drugs, and compared the drug responses of the same cells in monolayers. These experiments revealed an increased resistance in the three-dimensional tumor arrays of a remarkable 1,000-fold greater than in monolayer cultures, and a similar result was seen in three-dimensional histocultures in collagen. The tumor cells grew in the presence of drug concentrations that rendered monolayers to a viability less than 0.1% of control cultures. Amazingly, Heppner observed that the cells became sensitive again when replated as monolayers, and finally showed that even when exposed to melphalan and 5-fluorouracil in monolayer culture, cells transferred to collagen gels were again resistant based on three-dimensional architecture. Thus, the cells were exposed to the drugs as monolayers, facilitating access to the drugs, and, once the cells were transferred after drug exposure to a three-dimensional structure, high resistance to the drugs was sustained. 39, [97] [98] [99] [100] Based on the caliber of data referenced above, Teicher et al 101 serially passaged through multiple (ten) transfers EMT-6 tumors in mice that were treated with thiotepa, cisplatin, and cyclophosphamide over a prolonged 6-month period, thus producing extremely drug-resistant tumors in vivo. When these tumors were grown as monolayer cultures, they were as drug sensitive as the parental cells. Kobayashi and colleagues 102 grew the same in vivo drug-resistant tumor cell lines as spheroids in three-dimensional arrays, and resistance was almost 5,000 times that of the parent line with selected drugs, an example being the active form of cyclophosphamide used in vitro. Similarly extreme resistance was also observed to cisplatin and thiotepa. This resistance was not seen in monolayer cultures, even when the monolayers were cultured on traditional extracellular matrix substrates. These experiments reconfirmed that cells in a three-dimensional array are more drug resistant than monolayer cells in vitro and demonstrated that three-dimensional cellular configurations can and do become resistant to super-pharmacological doses of drugs by forming compact structures. 39 Rotating-Wall Vessel Tumor Models Several important human tumor models have been created in rotating-wall vessel cultures, specifically, lung, prostate, colon, breast carcinoma, and ovarian. 15, 67, 92, 103 Many of these models involve cancers that are leading killers in our society. We present two such examples in this section, colon and prostate carcinoma. As previously reviewed, the literature indicates the remarkable difference between chemotherapeutic cytotoxicity in two-dimensional and three-dimensional cellular constructs, which may be predicated on a number of criteria. Therefore, a three-dimensional tumor model that emulates differentiated in vivo-like characteristics would provide unique insights into tumor biology.",

RWVs were used in conjunction with multicellular cocultivation to develop a unique in vitro tissue modeling system. Cells were cultivated on Cytodex-3 microcarrier beads, with and without mixed normal human colonic fibroblasts, which served as the mesenchymal layer. Culture of the tumor lines in the absence of fibroblasts produced spheroid-like growth and minimal differentiation. In contrast, when tumor lines were cocultivated with normal colonic fibroblasts, initial growth was confined to the fibroblast population until the microcarriers were covered. The tumor cells then commenced proliferation at an accelerated rate, organizing themselves into three-dimensional tissue masses that achieved 1.0-to 1.5-cm diameters. Each of these engineered tumor tissues produced tissue-like aggregates (TLAs) with glandular structures, apical and internal glandular microvilli, tight intercellular junctions, desmosomes, cellular polarity, sinusoid development, internalized mucin, and structural organization akin to normal colon crypt development. Necrosis was minimal throughout the tissue masses up to 60 days of culture while achieving >1.0 cm in diameter. Other notable results included enhanced growth of neoplastic colonic epithelium in the presence of mixed normal human colonic mesenchyme. These results mimic the cellular differentiation seen in vivo and are similar to results obtained with other tumor types.",

            "text": "Prostate carcinoma has also been modeled in the RWV system by several investigators. [104] [105] [106] One of the most comprehensive descriptions of these engineered tissues is detailed by Wang et al 107 In that review, the authors describe the ability of the RWV system to recapitulate human prostate carcinoma (LNCaP) and bone stroma (MG63) to illuminate the evolution of prostate tumorigenesis to the metastatic condition. In particular, the LNCaP and ARCaP models represented in the review are known to be lethal in the human, being androgen independent and metastatic. Rotating-wall vessel TLA engineering also allowed in-depth study of epithelial and stromal interactions, which are the facilitating elements of the continuance of LNCaP prostate-specific antigen production in vitro. When LNCaP was cultured in three dimensions without stroma, production of prostate-specific antigen ceased, and metastatic markers were not observed. The authors outline the process of malignant transformation, demonstrating that these metastatic models are only possible in three-dimensional TLAs and are achieved by specific geometric relationships in three-dimensional configuration. Furthermore, they show through direct comparison with other culture systems the advantages of the RWV system to allow synergistic relationships to study this disease state. 107 The final two carcinoma models to be reviewed here are the subject of original ongoing research, breast carcinoma in Dr. Goodwin's lab and lung carcinoma in Dr. Vertrees' lab. As we have seen with the previous data, the modeling of three-dimensional tissues is not only achievable, but also desirable to create an improvement in the fidelity of the tumor model for research and diagnostic purposes. Construction of three-dimensional tumor models using RWVs has revealed striking similarities to tissues grown in vivo. 63, 67 As a demonstration of the capability of these advanced tumor models to produce unique results, we have developed three-dimensional breast carcinoma models and subjected them to assault by lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) and lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cell research has primarily dealt with tumor cells in single suspension cultured in the presence of LAK cells in close proximity using 96-well plates. Although a substantial amount of literature exists in this field, no literature could be found investigating three-dimensional tumor models and the kill response elicited in the presence of LAK cells. We hypothesized that not only would the three-dimensional models more closely resemble in vivo tissue histologically, but they also could demonstrate a useful application of using three-dimensional models. Three breast carcinoma cell lines were chosen for this investigation: BT-20, an undifferentiated estrogen receptor (ER)-cell line; MCF-7, a moderately differentiated and metastatic ER+ cell line; and T-47D, an ER+ cell line. Each cell line was cultured in the RWV for a minimum of 21 days. Mononuclear cells were isolated from peripheral blood lymphocytes and placed in T-flasks at a cell density of 1.5 \u00d7 10 6 cells/ml in the presence of rhIL-2. A modified procedure based on the standard 51 Cr release assay was developed to quantitate the activity of LAK cell invasion of three-dimensional (3-D) RWV-grown tumor aggregates. Cells from T-flasks (2-D controls) or RWV-grown aggregates (3-D) were labeled with 51 Cr and seeded into 12-well plates with LAK cells at a 10:1 ratio to the tumor cells. We chose the lowest ratio of effector cells to target cells compared to standard suspension cell protocols of using 10:1, 100:1, or 1,000:1. Spontaneous release controls were initiated identically without LAK cells. Supernatant samples were taken at 24-h and 48-h intervals and counted using a gamma counter. Maximum release data were obtained by lysing the entire cell popula-tion using Triton X-100. Cytokine analysis of the supernatant and flow cytometry analysis of the cytokine receptors were performed from samples taken at the same time points from a duplicate nonradiolabeled assay.",

Electron microscopy identified significant mitochondrial and granular endoplasmic reticular pathology in the 2-D cells not seen in the 3-D cells. 108 The degree of differentiation determined by immunohistochemistry shows that ultrastructure and antibody expressions were more representative of control tissue when cells (both immortalized and transfected) were grown in 3-D culture than when grown as a 2-D culture. Electron microscopy identified the presence of lipid inclusion and lamellar (surfactant) bodies indicative of type II pneumocytes, a differentiation not seen in monolayer cultures. Fluorescence microscopy allowed for determination of individual migrating cells (unpublished data). The coculture experiment (simultaneous cultures of normal and transformed lung cells) in the three-dimensional environment demonstrates the ability of the transformed cell to migrate through the preexisting normal cells.",

Nickerson et al 109 describe the development of a three-dimensional TLA engineered from INT-407 cells of the human small intestine, which were used as targets for the study of Salmonella typhimurium . In this study, three-dimensional TLAs were used to study the attachment, invasion, and infectivity of Salmonella into human intestinal epithelium. Immunocytochemical characterization and scanning and transmission electron microscopic analyses of the threedimensional TLAs revealed that the TLAs modeled human in vivo differentiated tissues more accurately than did two-dimensional cultures. The level of differentiation in the INT-407 TLAs was analogous to that found in previously discussed small intestine TLAs 62 and from other organ tissues reconstructed in rotating-wall vessels. Analysis of the infectivity studies revealed Salmonella attached and infected in a manner significantly different from that in control twodimensional cultures. During an identical exposure period of infection with Salmonella , the three-dimensional TLAs displayed a minor loss of structural integrity when compared with the two-dimensional INT-407 cultures. Furthermore, Salmonella demonstrated a greatly reduced ability to adhere, invade, and induce the apoptotic event in these INT-407 three-dimensional TLAs than in two-dimensional cultures. This result is not unlike the in vivo human response. Twodimensional cultures were significantly damaged within several hours of contact with the bacteria; conversely, although \"pot marks\" could be seen on the surfaces of the three-dimensional TLAs, they remained structurally sound.",

The respiratory epithelium is of critical importance in protecting humans from disease. Exposed to the environment, the respiratory epithelium acts as a barrier to invading microbes present in the air, defending the host through a multilayered complex system. 110 The three major layers of the human respiratory epithelium are pseudo-stratified epithelial cells, a basement membrane, and underlying mesenchymal cells. Ciliated, secretory, and basal epithelial cells are connected by intercellular junctions and anchored to the basement membrane through desmosomal interactions. Together with tight junctions and the mucociliary layer, the basement membrane maintains the polarity of the epithelium and provides a physical barrier between the mesenchymal layer and the airway. 111, 112 Infiltrating inflammatory and immune cells move freely between the epithelial and subepithelial compartments.",

Traditional monolayer cultures (two-dimensional) of immortalized human bronchoepithelial cells represent homogeneous lineages. Although growing cells in monolayers is convenient and proliferation rates are high, such models lack the morphology and cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions characteristic of human respiratory epithelia. Thus, their state of differentiation and intracellular signaling pathways most likely differ from those of epithelial cells in vivo. Primary cell lines of human bronchoepithelial cells provide a differentiated model similar to the structure and function of epithelial cells in vivo; however, this state is short lived in vitro. 117, 119 Air-liquid interface cultures of primary human bronchoepithelial cells (or submerged cultures of human adenoid epithelial cells) are grown on collagen-coated filters in wells on top of a permeable filter.

The result is a culture of well-differentiated heterogeneous (ciliated, secretory, basal) epithelial cells essentially identical to airway epithelium in situ. 118, 120 Although this model shows fidelity to the human respiratory epithelium in structure and function, maintenance of consistent cultures is not only difficult and time consuming but also limited to small-scale production and thus limits industrial research capability.",

[124] [125] [126] [127] This process is also influenced by the spatial relationships of cells to each other. Each epithelial cell has three membrane surfaces: a free apical surface, a lateral surface that connects neighboring cells, and a basal surface which interacts with mesenchymal cells. 128 Viral studies by Goodwin et al 129 and Suderman et al 130 were conducted with RWV-engineered TLA models of normal human lung. This model is composed of a coculture of in vitro three-dimensional human bronchoepithelial TLAs engineered using a rotating-wall vessel to mimic the characteristics of in vivo tissue and to provide a tool to study human respiratory viruses and host-pathogen cell interactions. The TLAs were bioengineered onto collagen-coated cyclodextran beads using primary human mesenchymal bronchial tracheal cells as the foundation matrix and an adult human bronchial epithelial immortalized cell line (BEAS-2B) as the overlying component. The resulting TLAs share significant characteristics with in vivo human respiratory epithelium, including polarization, tight junctions, desmosomes, and microvilli. The presence of tissue-like differentiation markers, including villin, keratins, and specific lung epithelium markers, as well as the production of tissue mucin, further confirm these TLAs differentiated into tissues functionally similar to in vivo tissues. Increasing virus titers for human respiratory syncytial virus ( wt RSVA2) and parainfluenza virus type 3 ( wt PIV3 JS) and the detection of membrane-bound glycoproteins (F and G) over time confirm productive infections with both viruses. Viral growth kinetics up to day 21 pi with wt RSVA2 and wt PIV3 JS were as follows: wt PIV3 JS replicated more efficiently than wt RSVA2 in TLAs. Peak replication was on day 7 for wt PIV3 JS [approximately 7 log 10 particle-forming units (pfu) per milliliter] and on day 10 for wtRSVA2 (approximately 6 log 10 pfu/ml). Viral proliferation remained high through day 21 when the experiments were terminated. Viral titers for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus were approximately 2 log 10 pfu/ml at 2 days post inoculation.",
