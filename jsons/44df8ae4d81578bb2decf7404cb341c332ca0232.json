It ranges from mild or no symptoms at all to severe 71 infection with pneumonia, adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), shock, and/or 72 multiorgan dysfunctions as acute renal injury. The commonest symptoms are fever 73 (98%) and dry cough (76%). Other symptoms include myalgia, fatigue, sore throat, 74 sneezing, chest tightness, headache, sputum production, hemoptysis, conjunctivitis 75 and diarrhea. After 7-8 days, a group of patients deteriorated to pneumonia and 76 ARDS. 32% of a series of 41 patients required intensive care unit (ICU) admission for 77 respiratory support [14]. Recovery, if occurred, started 2-3 weeks from onset of the 78 symptoms with median hospital stay duration at 10 days [15]. with fever and dry cough especially those with recent travel history 82 to the disease epicenters or in contact with positive cases should undergo specific 83 molecular test, a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based test, to 84 identify the disease. Whole genome sequencing may also be required to identify the 85 source of infection and any new mutations. Samples used for the diagnosis are usually 86 of respiratory origin (throat swab, sputum, nasopharynx swab, endotracheal aspirates, 87 and bronchoalveolar lavage). Great cautions are required to conduct the samples and 88 regulations with local infectious disease authorities [16]. patients. ESR and CRP are generally elevated. Raised aspartate aminotransferase, D-91 dimer, prothrombin time, CPK, LDH, and troponin are also noticed in some patients 92 especially those admitted to ICU. Procalcitonin level is usually normal and its 93 elevation may indicate bacterial superinfection [17]. 94 Regarding imaging, chest x ray may reveal bilateral chest infiltrates. CT chest is more 95 sensitive and specific than chest x ray and shows bilateral involvement in 98% of the 96 cases, with ground glass opacities and subsegmental consolidations. In some cases, 97 diagnosis was made on CT basis only with negative molecular tests that turned 98 positive later on; raising the importance of CT chest in the diagnosis and prognosis of 99 the disease [18].",

            "text": "surgeons are not considered the frontline in combating the 103 pandemic of COVID-19, but certain measures can be adopted in their practice during 104 this period that help to control and lessen the spread of the disease. Generally, the 105 main target in such adaptation circle around three main pillars: manage the surgeries 106 according to their priority, protect health care workers, and allocate the available 107 resources toward disease control. 108 1) Outpatient clinic measures: 109 Surgeons are advised to widen the follow up visits after surgeries to decrease 110 the crowd in the clinics. Patients who are in the waiting list with imminent due 111 dates are called to inform them regarding the new circumstances and the 112 postponing of their surgeries and asked them not to visit the clinic until the arrangement of new dates. The number of attendant patients in the clinic are 114 reduced to the half and the duration of clinic is doubled to ensure low number 115 of patients at any time in the clinic. A thermal scanner in the clinic is better be 116 available to trace those who have fever and refer them to the emergency 117 department for proper assessment [19]. 118 The surgeons in duty in the clinics are divided into two groups; each group 119 takes over a period of time in the clinic. So, each surgeon theoretically will 120 expose to a quarter of the usual number of patients. Protective face mask is 121 advised for every health care worker and regular hand disinfection by ethanol 122 alcohol 70%, or water and soup is a mandatory measure between each patient 123 to control the spread of the disease. 124 Certain simple clinic procedures are activated to decrease the burden on 125 surgical lists such as: intra-articular steroid injection in arthritis cases to 126 decrease pain exacerbation and delay the need for surgical treatment, steroid 127 injection for tendinopathy cases as rotator cuff tendinopathy, Golfer's and 128 Tennis elbow, steroid injection for Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, and 129 percutaneous tenotomy for talipes equinovarus cases. 130 A cell phone number with WhatsApp service are given to all clinic attendee to 131 keep in contact in case of emergency and to send clinical photos regarding the 132 wounds and the dressings in case of any inquiry. A home delivery service of 133 medications is advised for all patients rather than regular visits to hospitals and 134 pharmacies to ensure good distancing among the individuals. 135 AAOS recommends activation of telemedicine amid this pandemic in the form 136 of telephone visits, video conferencing, and E-visits [20]. institutional policies and recommendations from Federal and 142 local authorities, considering the availability of finite and essential 143 resources. However, AAOS supports the recommendations on delaying 144 elective surgeries advocated by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid 145 Services (CMS), the American College of Surgeons (ACS), and the U.S. 146 Surgeon General [21]. 147 Based on the suggested three pillars. We recommend to keep on the urgent 148 cases lists that cannot be delayed as: trauma cases, malignant tumor cases, 149 acute infection necessitating surgical intervention such as: Septic joint, acute 150 osteomyelitis with failed medical treatment or subperiosteal abscess, or acute 151 on top of chronic osteomyelitis, and certain cases that need 2 nd stage surgery to 152 complete the treatment as: cases with Masquelet technique, bone grafting 153 surgery, and infected arthroplasty requiring debridement or staged procedure 154 using spacer. A council of Orthopedic experts in different subspecialties are 155 organized to assess the cases needed exception and decided who can't be 156 postponed on individual basis. However, in analyzing the risk and benefit of and ankle, hand, benign tumor cases, and spine deformities. Recommendation 164 from orthopedic department, National University of Singapore is to continue 165 elective one day surgeries such as implant removal and arthroscopy as they 166 don`t utilize hospital resources and rapid discharge if possible [19]. We think 167 this can be adopted but we prefer decreased number of cases in the hospital to 168 ensure appropriate distancing especially that these measures can be postponed 169 safely and reassess the situation periodically for any changes that can be 170 implemented accordingly. 171 Measures should be taken to divide the health care workers into two groups 172 with day and night separate lists (instead of single large operation list). 173 Therefore, surgeries performed sequentially rather than concomitantly to 174 achieve good distancing. This separation enables the utilization of laminar air 175 flow theatres with ultraclean air currents. if elective case is planned for surgery, surgery is scheduled at 179 the same day of admission, if possible, to reduce in-patient stay. Similarly, 180 postoperatively, the patient has to stay the lowest possible duration in the 181 hospital. Forty-eight hours in most of the trauma cases is more than enough to 182 ensure intact neurovascular status, no endangering swelling, and good dressing 183 status. Only one visitor per patient is allowed during visits and should register 184 his/her data to trace source of infection if any. Upon discharge, physiotherapy, 185 if needed, is learned to be at home rather than at rehabilitation institutes or 186 formal physiotherapy sessions. who started suffering any symptoms suggesting COVID-197 19 infection should be self-isolated for 14 days at home to ensure no cross-198 infection. Strict hand hygiene and face mask should be adhered during the 199 practice. Online courses for how to wear personal protective equipment and to 200 use them in dealing with suspected/diagnosed cases. Other courses as basic 201 life support, respiratory support, and how to deal with patients in respiratory 202 distress should be lunched for preparing them as a second line of defense in 203 case of need. 204Learning of residents and fellows should not be stopped amid the pandemic.205The use of technology is an important substitute to face-to-face teaching. 1) World Health Organization.
