A majority of the Rubiaceae with known chromosome numbers, totaling only 6% of the described species but from diverse tribes, have a basic number of x = 11. This suggests a high degree of morphological differentiation in the family without change in chromosome number (Stebbins, 1950) . The preliminary studies in Hedyotis, however, indicate that the genus might be an exception to such a correlation. Therefore, one purpose of this study was to establish the chromosome numbers of the morphologically most varied species in North America in order to ascertain if H edyotis followed the cytological pattern so far observed for the Rubiaceae. To these data the results from morphology, geography, and ecology are added in an attempt to trace the phylogeny of the subg. Edrisia.",

Chromosome size varies from very large for those species in the x = 6 series ( Fig. 1-6 ), large to intermediate in the x = 11 group (Fig. 17-24 ), and small in the x = 9 and 13 lines, with intermediate and small sizes typical of the subg. Edrisia (25) (26) (27) (28) (29) and the subg. Oldenlandia (Fig. 30-34 ).

            "text": "Most species of the subg. Edrisia occur in either a mesic environment of the humid south temperate zone or a xeric environment of the Mexican highlands and associated areas. In the latter, 5 perennial and 4 annual species are known, all with a basic number of x = 11 (Fig.   36 ). This is the most common number in the subgenus as it is in the Rubiaceae. An isolated group of species with morphological affinities to those in the x = 11 line are found in Baja California (Fig. 35) . In this group having x = 13 as a basic number, the 2 annuals are restricted to the Cape region while the perennials are found over the southern two-thirds of the peninsula. Haploid numbers of 9 and 10 are shared by H. nigricans, the only species common to both mesic and xeric habitats (Fig. 37 ). Those individuals with n = 10 are restricted to the western regions of distribution; those with n = 9 are more frequent and widespread. Four species occur in the x = 8 series. The diploid H. crassifolia is common throughout the southern U.S., H. caerulea is more frequent to the north, the tetraploid H. australis is limited to the south central U.S., and the hexaploid H. michauxii is confined to the upland region of the Appalachians (Fig. 38) . The 2 species in the x = 7 series are probably the least known, e.g., the 2x species H. rosea described by Rafinesque (1817) was not \"rediscovered\" until Mueller and Mueller (1936) distinguished the species as Houstonia pygmaea over a century later. The species is now recorded from 9 south central states, of much wider distribution than the 4x H. procumbens (Fig. 39) . Those species with a base of x = 6 have a wide range in eastern North America (Fig. 40) (Terrell, 1959) . In addition to H. purpurea, diploid and tetraploid races are known for other species in the complex (Lewis and Terrell, unpublished) . A number of evolutionary trends in morphological expression are generally acknowledged in angiosperm groups (cf. Constance, 1955) . Although exceptions to most so-called primitive and advanced characters can be cited, these are fewer and the trends are most apparent in a small group of related species. In Hedyotis subg. Edrisia, the perennial habit; fruticose, upright, tall stems; open large corollas; homostyly; cymose inflorescence; absence of cleistogamous flowers; numerous, small, non-specialized seeds; and diploidy, are usually generalized expressions and may be considered the primitive conditions. From these it is not difficult to explain the origin of the reduced or the specialized and differentiated conditions rather than the reverse trend. Among the more advanced characteristics are included the annual habit; herbaceous, short, prostrate stems; salverform, reduced corollas; solitary, heterostylous and short-styled flowers; cleistogamous flowers; and few, intermediatesized, morphologically specialized seeds (Table 2) . For most species a high degree of differentiation is correlated with polyploidy.",

Thus, for 25 species of the subg. Edrisia initially separated by basic chromosome number, a range from a value of 4 for the most primitive species to 16 for the most advanced has been found (Table 3) . Among the aneuploid groups, the species with x = 13 are the least differentiated. This suggests that the species native to Baja California have remained closest to the primitive condition in the subgenus, a not uncommon characteristic of species in this region (Axelrod, 1960) . The only \"derived\" characters of the most primitive species, H. mucronata, are the salverform corollas and heterostylous flowers, both of which are common to many extant species of Hedyotis, and the few (ca. 25) seeds per capsule each of intermediate size (0.8 mm long). The species of the x = 11 group are more advanced than the preceding, although the perennial species have the suffruticose stems, thick root stocks, heterostylous flowers, and long, salverform corollas in common. The annual habit has been a major specialization in both lines, but in contrast to the annuals of the Cape region, those of northeastern Mexico and southern Texas are more specialized. Their stems are rarely more than 2 dm long, seeds are few per capsule andal] According to Baker (1959) , heterostyly in general insures outbreeding whereas the homostylous representatives of a heterostylous genus are habitual inbreeders. The short-styled species of such a genus must also be inbreeders, and, judging from the successful fruit sets for H. croftiae and H. greenmanii, they possess functional stigmas in contrast to functionless stigmas noted for similar flowers of Gouldia (Skottsberg, 1944) . These floral conditions, while insuring fertilization and increasing the opportunity for rapid colonization (Baker, 1955) The species is considered more primitive, how-ever, by having funnelform corollas and unspecialized seeds.",

There is considerable parallel development in these lines of which the annual habit, loss of long-styled flowers, reduction of corolla length, and concave-convex, craterform seeds with hilar ridges are the most conspicuous. Aneuploidy, by gain and loss of chromosomes from an x = 11 stock, has been dominant in the evolution of the subgenus. Only 12% of the species are polyploid, but the recent development of polyploid complexes in 3 species suggests a greater role in future speciation. All species having chromosomal races are heterostylous perennials. The longevity is perhaps what is needed to achieve the union between unreduced gametes (Baker, 1959) , while the outbreeding is probably a factor contributing to the reproductive success of the autotetraploids.",

The occurrence of the basic haploid number of x = 11 in many large and diverse tribes suggests a complement of some antiquity. Although the number may be a derived one (e.g., from prototypes with x = 5 and 6), the presence of x = 11 in nearly all modern woody tropical genera, genera which according to Darlington (1956) are least likely to be modified in chromosome number, indicates that this number is basic to most tribes, and therefore to the family as a whole.",

It is supposed that the ancestors of the extant species had a basic number of x = 11 in what was probably a more widespread phylad in the moist forest belt of that region during the Cretaceous. The restriction of the neotropical flora in the Tertiary in response to cooling and to drying in western North America probably broke this continuity, a fragment of which survived by migration to the maritime climate of southern Baja California, while the main stock of x = 11 evolved into a highly endemic group of species. This phylogeny is supported by the morphological study (Table  3 ), in which those species of Baja California possess the most primitive combination of characters in the subgenus. These species may be relics of the subtropical Tertiary flora which survived by migrating to similar environmental conditions not requiring major adaptions, whereas those taxa not migrating were lost to the western flora or were able to adapt to the new, more rigorous habitats. The latter was a means of survival for the x = 11 group whose extant species illustrate a more advanced morphology than do those of Baja California, even without change in chromosome number from the neotropical phylad.",
