            "text": "Severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome (SFTS) is an emerging tick-borne infectious disease caused by SFTS virus (SFTSV), belonging to the Phenuiviridae family of Bunyavirales [1, 2]. The genome of SFTSV is composed of three segmented RNAs: large (L) segment encoding RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), medium (M) encoding the envelope glycoproteins, Gn/Gc, and small (S) encoding the nucleocapsid and nonstructural proteins (NP and NS) [1]. Clinical manifestations include fever, gastrointestinal symptoms, leukocytopenia, and thrombocytopenia [3, 4]. Disease mortality of SFTS patients have been estimated to be 5 ~ 20% [3]. Even though the majority of SFTS cases has been reported from China [3], Korea [4], and Japan [5], SFTSV infections in southern Asia, including Vietnam, have been recently reported in a retrospective survey [6]. Currently, no specific viral therapy nor vaccine is available. An effective vaccine is needed to combat its relatively high mortality, especially in elderly patients, and spread of SFTSV between humans [7, 8].",

            "text": "Vaccine development for SFTS is at an early discovery phase and there have only been a few studies on vaccine candidates using animal infection models [8\u201311]. Immunization of NS antigen with Freund\u2019s adjuvant in C57BL/6 mice, which are naturally resistant to SFTSV but partially mimic human infections [12], failed to enhance viral clearance, although it induced high titer of anti-NS antibodies and significantly elevated IFN-\u03b3 levels in sera upon viral challenge [9]. Vaccination of plasmid DNAs encoding NP and NS peptides also enhanced antigen-specific cellular immunity of T cells, such as IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 secreting CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, in BALB/c mice when applied by nano-patterned microneedles [10]. However, the protective effect of cellular immunity induced by DNA vaccination was not confirmed by in vivo infection with SFTSV. Recently, Dong F. et al. reported that a single dose of live attenuated recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (rVSV) vaccine expressing the SFTSV Gn/Gc glycoproteins elicited high titers of protective neutralizing antibodies in both wild type and interferon \u03b1/\u03b2 receptor knockout (IFNAR KO) mice [11]. They clearly showed that a single dose rVSV carrying SFTSV Gn/Gc could provide complete protection against lethal challenge with SFTSV in young and old IFNAR KO mice, a promising infection model for severe human infection of SFTSV [11, 13, 14]. Nevertheless, the potential role of cellular immunity against the viral antigens in complete protection was not examined in this study, although adoptive transfer of immune sera from mice immunized with rVSV-Gn/Gc to na\u00efve IFNAR KO mice provide partial (~ 60%) protection against lethal SFTSV challenge [11].",

We examined whether it could provide protective immunity against lethal SFTSV infection in IFNAR KO mice. In order to facilitate the processing and presentation of the SFTSV antigens by dendritic cells (DCs) and enhance antigen-specific T cell responses, these recombinant antigens were fused with Fms-like tyrosine kinase-3 ligand (Flt3L) [15, 16]. Moreover, we generated a recombinant DNA encoding IL-12\u03b1 and \u03b2 in addition to the recombinant viral antigens (pSFTSV-IL12) to further enhance cell-mediated immunity [17]. Vaccination of pSFTSV-IL12 provided complete protection of IFNAR KO mice upon lethal SFTSV challenge, whereas immunization with pSFTSV elicits only partial protection, indicating that antigen-specific cellular immune responses enhanced by co-expression of IL-12 could play a significant role in protection against lethal SFTSV infection. We confirmed significantly higher levels of Gn and NP-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell responses in mice vaccinated with pSFTSV-IL12 when compared to those in mock vector-immunized mice. Therefore, our results indicate that enhanced antigen-specific T cell immunity against multiple SFTVS antigens by DNA vaccination could be a promising direction for developing an effective vaccine against SFTSV infection.",

The susceptibility of IFNAR KO mice to a Korean SFTSV isolate was examined by inoculating the mice with 1 x 101 to 1 x 105 FFU (S3A Fig). Upon infection, all the mice gradually lost body weight and became moribund from the third to fifth day after infection, depending on the infection dose. All the infected mice died at 5 ~ 9 d after infection (S3A Fig). Similar survival kinetics were previously reported in IFNAR KO mice infected with other SFTSV strains [11, 14], indicating that our Korean SFTSV isolate possesses an equivalent degree of virulence to prior Chinese isolates. The platelet counts in mice infected with 1 x 105 FFU of SFTSV significantly declined up to 4 d after infection, and the mean platelet volumes of the infected mice were significantly higher than those of control animals (S3B Fig), suggesting that platelet destruction and the activation of platelet production simultaneously occur during lethal infection [14].",

All the mock-immunized mice expired by 5 d after SFTSV infection. In contrast, all the mice immunized with pSFTSV-IL12 were protected from lethal viral challenge, and 40% (2 of 5) of mice vaccinated with pSFTSV survived (Fig 4A). Consistently, pSFTSV-IL12-vaccinated animals lost weight until 4 d after the viral challenge and recovered thereafter, whereas decrease in body weight of pSFTSV-immunized mice was observed up to 8 d after the challenge and the surviving mice gradually recovered. When we examined the progression of thrombocytopenia during the acute phase of infection in the mice, platelet counts in vector-immunized mice rapidly declined until expiration (Fig 4B, left panel). However, platelet counts only marginally decreased in mice vaccinated with pSFTSV or pSFTSV-IL12 and counts rebounded in pSFTSV-IL12-immunized mice at 4 d after viral infection. In addition, viral loads were significantly reduced in the plasma of pSFTSV or pSFTSV-IL12-vaccinated mice when compared to those of vector-immunized control at 4 d after infection. Notably, despite similar initial viral loads (~ 106 copies/ml of plasma) at 2 d after viral challenge among the mice groups, pSFTSV-IL12-vaccinated mice (mean \u00b1 S.D. = 4.2 \u00d7 106 \u00b1 4.6 \u00d7 106) were approximately five and fifty times lower than those of pSFTSV-vaccinated mice (mean \u00b1 S.D. = 2.1 \u00d7 107 \u00b1 1.7 \u00d7 107) and vector-immunized mice (mean \u00b1 S.D. = 2.0 \u00d7 108 \u00b1 1.9 \u00d7 108) at 4 d, respectively.",

Vaccination with Gn-Fc or Gc-Fc protein with Alum adjuvant efficiently induced specific antibodies against the immunized antigens in IFNAR KO mice; levels of antibody titers against both antigens were fairly similar (mean titer \u00b1 S.D. = 3,584 \u00b1 1,024, n = 4). In addition, levels of neutralizing antibodies against SFTSV in immune sera from mice immunized with either protein antigen were significantly higher than those from Fc-immunized controls, when assessed by focus reduction neutralization test (FRNT, Fig 5B). FRNT50 titers of immune sera from mice immunized with Gc-Fc (mean titer \u00b1 S.D. = 209 \u00b1 140, n = 4) and Gn-Fc (mean titer \u00b1 S.D. = 929 \u00b1 1,134, n = 4) were approximately five and twenty folds higher than those of Fc-immunized mice (mean titer \u00b1 S.D. = 42 \u00b1 29, n = 4). It is also notable that FRNT50 titers of Gn-Fc immune sera were generally higher than those of Gc-Fc sera, although the difference was not statistically significant. Finally, we examined the protective efficacy of the protein vaccines against lethal infection with SFTSV (Fig 5C). All the control mice immunized with Fc antigen died at five days after infection, whereas 50% of Gn-Fc immunized mice were protected from lethal challenge and regained their lost body weight. Interestingly, weight loss of Gc-Fc vaccinated mice was delayed and observed from 4 d after infection, whereas the control mice lost weight from 2 d after infection. Even though all the mice immunized with Gc-Fc succumbed to death, they survived three days more than control mice and the extension of median survival time was statistically significant (p = 0.0046).",

            "text": "DNA vaccination has been widely investigated for various infectious diseases, especially targeting viral infections, during the last two decades [24, 25]. Although, human clinical trials of DNA vaccines have yielded poor immunogenicity and less than optimal results, the approval of a few veterinary vaccines is a testimony of proof-of-concept and the hope that licensed DNA vaccines for human use may not be too far away [24]. While we were preparing this manuscript, Kwak J.E. et al. reported a promising demonstration of DNA vaccination against lethal SFTSV infection in old-aged (> 4-years-old) ferret model [26]. They used five plasmid DNAs encoding individual viral gene, Gn, Gc, NP, NS, or RdRp, and found that vaccination of old ferrets with a mixture of the five plasmids completely protected ferrets from lethal SFTSV challenge without developing any clinical symptoms and systemic viremia [26]. In addition, adoptive transfer of immune sera from ferrets immunized with two plasmids encoding Gn and Gc could not perfectly prevent the systemic viremia after SFTSV infection, but provided complete protection against lethal challenge, suggesting that Gn/Gc may be the most effective antigens for inducing protective immunity. They also found that non-envelop (NP, NS, and RdRp)-specific T cell responses also contribute to protection against SFTSV infection although it failed to induce neutralizing activity [26]. Here we also observed that vaccination with a plasmid encoding Gn, Gc, NP, and NS, together with murine IL-12, could provide protective immunity in IFNAR KO mice against lethal SFTSV challenge. However, our current DNA vaccine failed to suppress initial systemic viremia and weight loss (Fig 4). This might be due to the lack of type I interferon signaling and/or poor antibody responses against Gn and Gc glycoproteins, which are required for viral neutralization during the early stage of viral infection. Inefficient generation of antibodies against Gn and Gc might be due to the absence of type I interferon signaling in IFNAR KO mice or fusion of Flt3L with the glycoproteins, resulting in conformation defect of the antigens and/or dysregulation of B cell responses. Given that immunization with Gn-Fc and Gc-Fc proteins can induce specific antibodies in IFNAR KO mice (Fig 5), the absence of type I IFN signaling might not be the cause of inefficient antibody generation. Instead, Flt3L may suppress specific antibody responses as observed in other studies [16, 27\u201329]. Flt3L may exert tolerogenic effect on CD4 T cells via dendritic cells, thereby promoting B cell hypo-responsiveness in vivo; however, the underlying mechanisms of CD4 T cell dysregulation are still unclear [28]. Nevertheless, Flt3L can significantly enhance CD8 T cell responses when fused with a target antigen and promote persistent maintenance of antigen-specific CD8 T cells in vivo [16, 29]. In this study, we also observed significant enhancement of Gn and NP-specific CD8 T cell responses, as well as CD4 T cells, in the presence of IL-12 expression (Fig 3B and 3C), which correlated well with vaccine protective efficacy in mice infected with lethal doses of SFTSV. The potent effect of antigen-specific T cell responses in protection against SFTSV infection is consistent with the results of the aforementioned ferret infection model [26]. In this study, we did not include a negative control using a plasmid encoding IL-12 alone, since it has been shown that IL-12 alone failed to boost antigen-specific cellular immunity [30].",

Both protein antigens are immunogenic and induce significant levels of neutralizing activity against SFTSV, although anti-Gn antibodies retain relatively higher neutralizing capacity than anti-Gc antibodies. Consistently, the protective efficacy of Gn protein vaccination is relatively higher than Gc protein immunization. While vaccination with either protein antigen failed to provide complete protection against lethal SFTSV challenge, Gc vaccine prolonged the survival time of infected mice and Gn antigen can provide partial protection. Considering that Gn and Gc glycoproteins function as viral ligands for cellular receptor binding and viral membrane fusion in host endosome, respectively [31\u201333], neutralization of both antigens might be required to completely block viral attachment and entry into host cells.",
