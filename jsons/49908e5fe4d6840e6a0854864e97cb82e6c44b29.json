The model is based on the numerical solution of the widely used Susceptible-Infectious-Removed (SIR) populations model for describing epidemics. We consider an expanded version of the original Kermack-McKendrick model, which includes a decaying value of the parameter \u03b2 (the effective contact rate) due to externally imposed conditions, to which we refer as the forced-SIR (FSIR) model. We introduce an approximate analytical solution to the differential equations that represent the FSIR model which gives very reasonable fits to real data for a number of countries over a period of 100 days (from the first onset of exponential increase, in China). The proposed model contains 3 adjustable parameters which are obtained by fitting actual data (up to April 28, 2020). We analyze these results to infer the physical meaning of the parameters involved. We use the model to make predictions about the total expected number of infections in each country as well as the date when the number of infections will have reached 99% of this total. We also compare key findings of the model with recently reported results on the high contagiousness and rapid spread of the disease.",

Thus, we will use this value as a proxy for R 0 , and will refer to it as R 0 . The parameters estimated from the fit of our analytical model to reported data give a value of R 0 which is in agreement with the recently reported median value of R 0 for the pandemic. In order to obtain a meaningful fit, we had to consider data for each country that show a monotonic increase at the beginning. This means that a few data points in each case were excluded, as they corresponded to sporadic reports of very few isolated cases, typically 1 to 10 in a given day, interspersed by several days of zero cases. In practice this means that the fitting begins at a certain cutoff day denoted as t 0 . In order to make the fit more robust and simpler, we chose \u03b1 1 = \u03b1 2 = \u03b1. Moreover, we found by trial-and-error that the value \u03b1 = 0.25 is the optimal choice for all the countries we considered. This leaves three adjustable parameters in the model that can be varied to obtain the best fit to the data, namely t 1 , t 2 and N ; instead of t 1 and t 2 , we elected to use instead as independent parameters t 1 and \u2206t = t 2 \u2212 t 1 .

The choice of the 10 countries also aims to represent parts of the world more heavily or less heavily impacted by the disease, as well as more typical cases. Here we defined the impact as the total number N T of infected individuals during the first wave of the pandemic, as predicted by the FSIR model; this number is scaled by the population of the country, N P , in Fig. 3 . In particular, we have included 3 countries in which the impact was small, China, Greece and Australia for which (N T /N P ) < 500 infected per million, 3 countries in which the impact was moderate, Denmark, Germany and France for which 1, 000 < (N T /N P ) < 2, 000 infected per million, and four countries where the impact was large, Switzerland, Italy, USA and Spain for which (N T /N P ) > 3, 000 infected per million.

Greece, Denmark, and China have low values of case fatality ratios and deaths per 100K of the population, and so have Germany and USA. Australia has the lowest ratio. On the other hand, France, Italy, and Spain have the highest ratios. In the scaled data, it is clear that Greece, China, and Australia are atypical cases (\"outliers\") as having very low number of scaled deaths, while Spain, Italy, and France have the largest number of scaled deaths, in descending order; all sets represent deaths per 100K of the population of the respective country. Apparently, a low value of t 1 tends to imply a low N T and a low case fatality ratio and deaths, as the examples of China, Greece and Denmark demonstrate. In other words, early adoption of measures to contain the spread of the disease pay off. On the other extreme, the countries with high values of t 1 tend to have high values of N T , especially Spain, which, along with Italy and France have very high case fatality ratios and deaths.

Greece, although it suffered relatively small number of cases, has a large value for the basic reproduction number (R 0 \u2248 7.53). USA, Spain, and Italy suffer the highest numbers of expected total cases (N T ), whereas in the case of Greece the expected total number of cases is one of the lowest in the set, presumably due to the fast implementation of measures imposed by the government and followed by the citizens. It should be noted that Greece has one of the smaller t 1 values. Australia, with R 0 \u2248 1.42, has the lowest value of the basic reproduction number, making the pandemic in this country to resemble the epidemiological characteristic of a seasonal flu.It is interesting to speculate on the meaning of these results. N T , the total number of reported infections, is an important quantity because the number of fatalities (case fatality)is roughly proportional to this number, although the constant of proportionality varies in each country, ranging from a high of about 0.15 for Belgium, 0.14 for France, 0.13 for Italy, to a low of about 0.01 for Australia, and about 0.05 for Greece, China, and Denmark[17].",
