Two genogroup III genotypes were suggested by partial genomic analyses. In the present study, analysis of the fulllength genome sequence of Bo/Newbury2/76/UK and the more contemporary Newbury2-like virus, Bo/Dumfries/1994/UK, showed that both were 7311 nucleotides in length and had three open reading frames (ORFs), amino acids motifs typical of noroviruses, and 95% or greater amino acid identities to each other in all regions of their genome. Apart from the ORF1 NTPase region, their ORF1 regions had less than 90% identity to the genogroup III genotype 1 Bo/Jena/80/DE virus, confirming two genogroup III genotypes. A close antigenic relationship was demonstrated by ELISA between the genotype 2 viruses, which will allow their serological diagnosis. * Deceased 258 S. L. Oliver et al.",

Recently, bovine viruses identified some years ago were identified as noroviruses [5, 25] . Human noroviruses belong to genogroups I and II [10] , whereas the bovine noroviruses have been placed in a separate genogroup, III [1, 5, 25, 33] . Comparisons of partial genomic sequences of the two original bovine viruses identified two genetic clusters (genotypes) within genogroup III, represented by the Bo/Jena/80/DE virus (genogroup III/1), and the Bo/Newbury2/76/UK virus (genogroup III/2). as a homologous challenge control and was given a primary inoculation with Newbury2 plus primary and secondary challenge inoculations with Newbury2. Two calves (P137 and P142) were given a primary inoculation and primary challenge inoculation with Newbury2 and secondary challenge to Newbury1. The fourth calf (Q21) served as a Newbury2 challenge control and was inoculated for the first time with Newbury2 at the time of challenge. Preinoculation and post-primary, post-primary challenge and post-secondary challenge sera were taken (see Table 2 ) and had been stored at \u221220 \u2022 C. No evidence of antibody degradation was obtained during storage by monitoring antibody titres from calves infected with bovine rotavirus (unpublished) . Two gnotobiotic calves were orally inoculated with Bo/Dumfries/1994/UK, and sera were taken 14 days later, then again 8 and 15 days after homologous challenge. Bovine antisera from calves inoculated with bovine rotavirus UK, the bovine enteric coronavirus, bovine astrovirus and the Haden strain of parvovirus [3] were used in the Newbury2 ELISA to determine specificity.",

PCR was performed using the Hi Fidelity PCR system (ROCHE). An amino acid alignment of polyproteins from the genus Norovirus (Bo/Jena/1980/DE, 17 human noroviruses from genogroup I or II plus the murine norovirus) was used to identify conserved sequences in the NTPase region of the polyprotein, DRIEK/NK and APQGGFD. Primers JENA01 and JENA02 were designed to the conserved region in the NTPase corresponding to the Jena virus nucleotide sequence ( Table 3 ). The subsequent nucleotide sequence of a 262-bp amplicon generated from the Dumfries genome that was cloned into a pCR2.1-TOPO vector was used to design additional primers, which were used to amplify two regions (JANA01/BoCVhelR 02 -1851 nucleotides; BoCVhel 01/BoCVproR 01 -1944 nucleotides) of the Newbury2 and Dumfries genomes. Amplicons cloned into pCR2.1 (Invitrogen) were sequenced in both directions using overlapping primers ( Table 3 ). The 5 end of the Newbury2 genome was deduced using 5 rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). cDNA generated by reverse transcription using the primer BoCV5 RACE 05 was purified using a QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen). Terminal deoxynucleotide transferase (Promega) was used to add a poly-C tail to the 5 end of the purified cDNA. The 5 end of the Newbury2 genome was amplified using the Hi Fidelity PCR system (ROCHE) with an abridged anchor primer (Invitrogen) and BoCV5 RACE 06 ( Table 3 ). The resulting 337-bp amplicon was cloned into pCR2.1, and 5 clones were sequenced in both directions to establish a consensus nucleotide sequence. The MRC gene service performed sequencing and the sequences were assembled using Staden [39] .",

The majority of the variation was within the first 500 nucleotides and between nucleotides 2000 and 3000, which included the 3A-B(VPg) region, with only 71% [33] amino acid identity. The NTPase regions of the two viruses showed a remarkably high level of identity (92% amino acid), higher than that of the 3D-polymerase regions. Extensive variation between the Newbury2 and Jena genomes was also seen for the ORF2 and 3 genes, but this was reported previously [30] . All regions of the Newbury2 genome, including the ORF2 and 3 genes reported previously [30] , had low levels of amino acid identities with genogroups I and II noroviruses and the murine norovirus ( Table 1) . The Newbury2 genome showed moderate nucleotide conservation (11 of 24 nucleotides) between its 5 terminus region and the region of the ORF1 and 2 overlap ( Fig. 1 panel A) . This is typical for all members of the family Caliciviridae, especially members of the genus Norovirus [10] and including the bovine Jena genome. This finding suggests that the transcription/translation mechanism of ORFs 1 and 2 of bovine noroviruses is similar to other caliciviruses. Consistent with Jena, the putative protease cleavage sites, LQGP and LQAP, on either side of the NTPase, plus FQAP and LEGG, on either side of the 3C protease, were conserved for Newbury2 (Fig. 1B) . A cleavage site could not be identified for the 3A-B(VPg) region because the conserved human noroviruses dipeptides used to predict the cleavage sites were not present for the bovine noroviruses. The amino acid motifs typical of caliciviruses were present in the Newbury2 ORF1 polyprotein in the NTPase (GPPGIGKT), the 3C protease (GDCG) and the 3D polymerase (GLPSG and YGDD), as previously described for Jena [25] .",

Similar levels of identity were found between the Dumfries and Newbury2 ORF2 and 3 proteins, including the hypervariable capsid P2 region [33] .

The levels of genomic identity between the Newbury2 and Dumfries ORF1 genes reported in the present study, and between the ORF2 and 3 genes of Newbury2, Dumfries and the Newbury2-like viruses [14, 32, 33, 38, 44, 45] , was surprisingly high for RNA viruses identified over almost 3 decades. The tight clustering of the Newbury2 viruses resembled the tight clustering seen, for example, for human genogroup II/4 Lordsdale-type viruses. It remains to be seen whether this tight clustering will persist and whether the number of bovine genotypes will increase as more studies are conducted. The levels of identity observed between the Newbury2 and Dumfries genomes was not a consequence of selection by the RT-PCR primers used to amplify these viruses. Both Newbury2 and Dumfries were originally identified by electron microscopy, from disparate geographical locations and 18 years apart [46; D. Snodgrass, personal communication] . The apparent stability of the genotype 2 bovine norovirus genome will simplify diagnostic tests based on RT-PCR. Most recent studies have used primers designed to the polymerase region that might favour detection of Newbury2-like viruses [33, 38, 44, 45] but the finding that the NTPase was also highly conserved between genotype 1 and 2 bovine noroviruses (92% amino acid identity) offers an opportunity to use RT-PCR primers based on the NTPase region which might identify a wider range of bovine noroviruses, if they exist. The high amino acid identities in the capsid regions of Newbury2 and Dumfries genomes correlated with the ability of Newbury2 VLPs to detect Dumfries virus antibodies. The results of the present paper, combined with observations that other genotype 2 bovine noroviruses have 94% or greater amino acid identity with Newbury2 [14, 33, 45] , suggested that serological assays based on Newbury2 will be suitable to detect genogroup III/2 bovine noroviruses and their antibodies. This view is endorsed by studies with human noroviruses with similar identities in their capsid proteins and which show antigenic cross-reactivity [12, 19] . In contrast, a recent study of the antigenic relationship of Newbury2 and the genotype 1 Jena virus, which have 68% amino acid identify in their capsid proteins, showed that they were poorly related antigenically and that independent ELISAs are required to detect both [31] . Similarly, studies of human norovirus capsid proteins with 73% amino acid identity or less showed little or no cross reactivity in ELISA [12, 19] . Although not tested by ELISA, the capsid amino acid identities of Newbury2 with human genogroup I and II noroviruses of 48 and 43% make it unlikely that the Newbury2 viruses cross-react with human genogroup I and II noroviruses in ELISA. However, it should be noted that a cross-reactive epitope between some genogroup II human noroviruses and the Newbury2 and Jena viruses has been identified using a monoclonal antibody [31] . The lack of reactivity of Newbury1 antiserum in the Newbury2 ELISA reported in the present study, and the lack of cross-protection between the two viruses [3] is explained by the recent finding that Newbury1 belongs to a new genus in the family Caliciviridae [30] .",

Homologous protection to Newbury2 disease and virus shedding was reported in calves [3] , thus allowing calves to be used as an experimental model for immunity to disease. Except for the study by Subekti et al. [42] , norovirus disease models using chimpanzees and non-human primates [36, 47] have not produced clinical signs, although serological responses and virus excretion were demonstrated. The calf model allows pre-exposure to norovirus infection to be controlled, but it does have the limitations of production of few offspring and animal size.",

Comparison of the 24 nucleotides at the 5 terminus of the Newbury2 genome (nucleotides 1 to 24) with that of the Newbury2 ORF1 and 2 overlap (nucleotides 5059 to 5082) is shown with the initiation codons underlined and the termination codon for ORF1 in italics.

The shaded box shows the likely organisation of the bovine norovirus polyprotein (the term NTPase is used in the text for the 2C-helicase region). The protease cleavage sites above the shaded box were predicted from human noroviruses. The figures either side of the conserved norovirus amino acid motifs, shown below the shaded box, are the locations in the Newbury2 and Dumfries polyproteins and differ slightly from those in the Jena virus because of insertions and deletions in the polyproteins (refer to text) separated genogroup III from the human genogroups (I and II) was exclusively supported by quartet puzzling statistics or bootstrap values from the parsimony (Protpars) and distance methods (Fitch-Margoliash and UPGMA) of Phylip (data not shown).",
