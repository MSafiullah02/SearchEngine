            "text": "Invasion of microbe to the host induces a defense response that is initiated by pattern\u2010recognition receptors (PRRs) (1, 2). PRRs recognize conserved structures in pathogens and are largely divided into four types based on structural homology: Toll\u2010like receptors (TLRs), C\u2010type lectin receptors (CLRs), RIG\u2010I\u2010like receptors (RLRs), and NOD\u2010like receptors (NLRs). In addition, intracellular DNA sensors are proposed as new types of PRRs. Each PRR induces production of proinflammatory cytokines and type I interferons (IFNs). Proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin\u20101 (IL\u20101), IL\u20106, IL\u201012, and tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF\u03b1), induce several events including inflammation and homing and activation of adaptive immune cells, including T and B cells. Type I IFNs are composed of more than 10 members: multiple IFN\u03b1 family members, IFN\u03b2, IFN\u03b5, and IFN\u03c4 (3). Type I IFNs play a central role in antiviral responses by inducing transcription of IFN\u2010stimulated genes (ISGs). The ISGs include more than 1000 genes, although many remain uncharacterized. Some of these genes, such as IFN\u2010stimulated protein of 15 kDa (ISG15), myxovirus resistance 1 (Mx1), ribonuclease L (RNaseL), and protein kinase R (PKR), have antiviral effects, as demonstrated in mouse genetic studies (4). Antiviral states are often achieved by a combination of several ISGs, and each ISG is likely to have a specific target to suppress virus replication and budding. Recent studies have described the function of each ISG, defining its specific target pathogen, such as viperin, samhd1, or members of the gbp family (5, 6, 7).",

            "text": "TLRs are a family of single membrane\u2010spanning receptors of which there are 10 in human and 12 in mouse (1, 2). TLRs have conserved homology regions, containing leucine\u2010rich repeats (LRRs) in the extracellular space linked by the transmembrane region to the intracellular Toll/IL\u20101 receptor (TIR) domain. Specific patterns from microbial pathogens are recognized by LRRs, which are predicted to predominantly form a dimer for ligand binding. The TLRs are characterized by an ectodomain for ligand recognition (discussed in the following section), whereas the TIR domain is highly homologous, as demonstrated by structural analysis (9, 10). Activation of the TLRs by ligand binding conducts a signal from its TIR domain to the adapter protein that contains the TIR domain. The adapter protein acts mainly via two signaling pathways: the TIR domain containing the adapter inducing IFN\u03b2 (TRIF)\u2010dependent pathway, and the myeloid differentiation primary response protein (MyD88)\u2010dependent pathway. TLR3 depends on TRIF, whereas TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9 depend on MyD88 (11, 12). Both adapter proteins culminate in the activation of transcription factors, such as the nuclear factor of \u03ba light polypeptide gene enhancer in B cells 1 (NF\u2010\u03baB), IFN regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and IRF7 for transcription of proinflammatory cytokines, and type I IFNs. Briefly, TRIF recruits TNF receptor\u2010associated factor 6 (TRAF6), TRAF3, TNF receptor\u2010associated death domain (TRADD), receptor interacting protein\u20101 (RIP\u20101), and transforming growth factor\u2010\u03b2 activated kinase 1 (TAK1), whereas MyD88 recruits IRAK1, IRAK2, IRAK4, TRAF6, and TAK1. TAK1 induces activation of the canonical inhibitor of NF\u2010\u03baB kinase (IKK) \u03b1/\u03b2 complex, resulting in NF\u2010\u03baB activation. TRAF3 leads to activation of TANK\u2010binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and IKK\u03b9 to phosphorylate IRF3 (1, 2). In general, signaling networks are shared among the TLR family members and are utilized by the same signaling proteins. MyD88 forms the helical structure for providing signaling platform with downstream protein. Structural analysis demonstrated that MyD88 forms a well\u2010ordered helix with IRAK2 and IRAK4 through their death domains (13, 14) (\nFig. 1\n).",

For example, plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs), which are a subset of DCs expressing CD11c and B220 (16, 17, 18), express high levels of TLR7 and TLR9 but not TLR3. They induce robust production of type I IFNs when activated by TLR7 or TLR9. In other types of cells, even if TLR7 and TLR9 are expressed, their stimulation generally does not cause abundant type I IFNs production but produces inflammatory cytokines. Conventional DCs (cDCs), a non\u2010pDC subset of DCs, also induce type I IFNs upon virus infection but mainly from RLRs (19).

One group, including TLR1, TLR2, TLR4, TLR5, TLR6, and TLR11, is expressed on the plasma membrane and mainly recognizes protein, lipid, and lipoprotein in microbial membrane components. The other group includes TLR3, TLR7, TLR8, and TLR9, which recognize nucleic acids and are localized in the intracellular vesicles such as endoplasmic reticulum (ER), lysosomes, and endosome. Endosome localization of TLRs is regulated by the ER\u2010localized multi\u2010membrane spanning protein UNC93B1. DCs from mice with a single missense mutation at UNC93B1 have defects in cytokine production by TLR3, TLR7, and TLR9 ligands (26), and these mice are susceptible to the DNA virus, herpes simplex virus\u20101 (HSV\u20101) (27). UNC93B1 binds to the transmembrane region of TLR3, TLR7, and TLR9 and transports these TLRs from the ER to the endolysosome (28, 29). The adapter protein 3 (AP3), a well\u2010known trafficking protein for cargo formation, has been shown to be critical for TLR9 trafficking and type I IFN production in pDCs (30). The physiological reason for the restricted localization of TLRs is not clear, but TLR9, not TLR7, requires acidification at the endolysosome (31). Synthetic nucleotides or nucleic acids derived from dead cells are directly endocytosed and delivered to the endolysosome where they encounter with TLRs. Viruses and microbes in which the genomic nucleic acids are covered with a membrane are also endocytosed and are likely to be recognized by TLRs after the nucleic acids are exposed through mechanisms which are unknown. Viruses pretreated with ultraviolet radiation are still able to induce cytokines via nucleic acid\u2010sensing TLRs, suggesting that virus replication and growth of microbes are not directly linked to sensing.",

            "text": "TLR3 was originally identified as recognizing polyinosinic\u2010polycytidylic acid (polyI:C), the synthetic analog of dsRNA. TLR3 recognizes genomic dsRNA of dsRNA viruses or dsRNA that are produced during replication of ssRNA viruses or DNA viruses. TLR3\u2010deficient mice are susceptible to ssRNA viruses such as West Nile virus (WNV) (32), Semliki Forest virus (25), and encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) (33) and DNA viruses such as mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV) (34) and HSV\u20101 (35). TLR3 deficiency in humans also causes an increase in infection rates of HSV\u20101 (35). The molecular mechanism of dsRNA binding to TLR3 is also revealed by structural analysis. The ectodomain is conserved through TLR2, TLR3, and TLR4. This site includes a large horseshoe\u2010like shape and forms a dimer with the binding pathogen, although the specific binding mechanism to the ligand differs between them. Structural analysis of the mouse TLR3 ectodomain interacting with dsRNA indicated that one end of the dsRNA of the sugar\u2013phosphate backbone is sandwiched between two ectodomains at positively charged residues in each TLR3 (36, 37). Positively charged residues in TLR3 sites are located in two regions near the N\u2010 and C\u2010termini of the horseshoe, and the two binding sites are separated by approximately 120 \u00c5, almost equal to approximately 45 base pairs of dsRNA in length. Supporting structural analysis, TLR3 binding to dsRNA is dependent on pH and dsRNA length. TLR3 does not bind to dsRNA at neutral pH but binds strongly at pH 6.5, which suggests that binding is mediated by a charged interaction, and requires 40\u201350 base pairs of dsRNA for stable binding (38).",

TLR7 and TLR8 have sequence similarity and mostly recognize the same native pathogens, although TLR7 prefers GU\u2010rich RNA sequences and TLR8 prefers AU\u2010rich RNA sequences in human (39). In mice, sequence preference between TLR7 and TLR8 is not clearly observed. Cells derived from TLR7\u2010deficient mice fail to induce cytokines in response to ssRNA viruses such as influenza A virus (IAV), vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), and human immunodeficiency virus\u20101 (HIV\u20101) (40, 41, 42). The preference of TLR7 for GU\u2010rich sequences is demonstrated by the fact that they are found in the genomes of IAV and HIV\u20101 (42). In addition, TLR7 detects RNAs from bacteria such as Group B Streptococcus but not other bacteria such as Listeria monocytogenes and Group A Streptococcus.

Later, viral DNA was also shown to be recognized by TLR9. The structure of TLR9 ectodomain with its ligand has not yet been solved. Several types of CpG DNA have been tested for their abilities to induce cytokine production by pDCs, which suggests that there is a specific recognition mechanism. TLR9 has sequence preferences but potentially recognizes a broad range of sequences, suggesting its sugar\u2010backbone of DNA may be the site recognized by TLR9 (44, 45). TLR9 has been shown to act as a sensor for viruses such as MCMV, HSV\u20101 (46), HSV\u20102 (31), and adenovirus (47) in DCs.

TLR9 and CpG DNA are likely to bind directly (45), although several proteins have been proposed as intermediate cofactors to initiate the activation. The high mobility group box (HMGB) is an intermediate protein. It is initially retained inside the cell cytosol, is secreted in response to cell damage or inflammation, and acts as a cytosolic DNA sensor. After binding to DNA, HMGB1 activates downstream DNA\u2010sensing receptors, including TLR9 and a cytosolic DNA sensor (48). Self\u2010DNA does not normally initiate DC activation, but self\u2010DNA and protein complexes induce autoimmune disease under certain conditions (as discussed in the following section). Another converter of self\u2010DNA to pathogenic ligand is LL37, which was found to bind to self\u2010DNA from a psoriasis patient. LL37\u2010DNA complex may promote the endocytosis pathway and sustain TLR9 activation by modification of the interaction with DNA (49). LL37 facilitates TLR9 activation of self\u2010DNA and synthetic CpG DNA. Another cofactor, graulin, which is constantly secreted from macrophages, was recently identified as another protein that binds to TLR9. Granulin is critical for production of IFN\u03b1 from DCs by facilitating internalization of CpG DNA (50). In addition to the intermediate proteins, TLR9 is modified by proteases by cleavage of the ectodomain. TLR9 is initially localized in the ER as a precursor. N\u2010terminal cleavage by proteolytic enzymes such as cathepsin B, S, L, H, K (51), and asparagine endopeptidase (52) induces its localization change to the endosome where it attains its functional form.",

RIG\u2010I was initially identified by expression screening for IFN\u03b2 promoter activity, and MDA5 and LGP2 were later identified as family members (53). RIG\u2010I and MDA5 have similar domain structures, having N\u2010terminal tandem Caspase recruitment domains (CARDs) that are necessary for activating downstream signaling, and the DEAD box helicase/ATPase domain. LGP2, however, lacks the CARD. Cells deficient for RIG\u2010I or MDA5 fail to induce cytokine production when challenged with several RNA viruses or stimulated with synthetic RNA. LGP2 is dispensable for cytokine production after stimulation with synthetic RNA but is required for cytokine production following infection with certain RNA viruses that are recognized by RIG\u2010I and MDA5 (54). Normal response to synthetic RNA ligands in the absence of LGP2 suggests that LGP2 may modify viral RNA by removing proteins from viral ribonucleoprotein complexes that can access RNA to RIG\u2010I and MDA5 for recognition. RIG\u2010I and MDA5 may recognize the same synthetic polyI:C that is commonly used for mimicking viral RNA but may have different length preferences. The short polymers of polyI:C (approximately 70 base pairs\u2010long) are recognized by RIG\u2010I, whereas the long polymers of polyI:C (2 kilo base pairs\u2010long) are recognized by MDA5 (55). Separation of ligand preferences by sequence length is unsatisfactory, because common DNA and RNA binding domains recognize roughly one helical turn, namely a 5\u20138 amino acid sequence. In addition, binding analysis using several synthetic analogs such as the 5\u2032\u2010phosphorylated RNA or the blunt ended dsRNA suggests that the specific structure of the 5\u2032 end is critical for binding to the C\u2010terminal domain of RIG\u2010I and MDA5. Consistent with its ligand preference, structural analysis indicated that the acidic surface of C\u2010terminal binding site in RIG\u2010I is important for recognition of the 5\u2032 end of the RNA sequence (56). The C\u2010terminal region of MDA5 has a similar overall structure to that of RIG\u2010I (57, 58), which does not fully explain the ligand preferences. Although the molecular mechanism for discrimination of RNA recognition between RIG\u2010I and MDA5 is not fully clear, the receptor responsible for recognition of each virus was identified among fibroblast cells isolated from the knockout mouse. Viruses can be separated into three groups: those specifically sensitive to RIG\u2010I, those specifically sensitive to MDA5, and those sensitive to both RIG\u2010I and MDA5. The NDV, SeV, VSV, influenza virus, and Japanese encephalitis virus are specifically recognized by RIG\u2010I. Piconaviruses including EMCV, Mengo virus, and Theiler\u2019s virus are recognized by MDA5. Dengue virus and WNV are recognized by both RIG\u2010I and MDA5 (19, 59, 60, 61, 62).",

The capping structure in self\u2010mRNA is likely to be critical in distinguishing host RNA from viral RNA, but many viruses replicating in the cytoplasm develop other types of modification at the 5\u2032 end (67). They may also contain 5\u2032 end modification enzymes such as RNA 5\u2032 triphosphatase, RNA guanyltranferase, RNA N7\u2010metyltransferase, or 2\u2032\u2010O\u2010methyltransferase, which are homologous to the mammalian enzymes. A recent study clearly demonstrated the importance of one modification, 2\u2032\u2010O\u2010methyltransferation in viral RNA. Coronavirus mutants lacking 2\u2032\u2010O\u2010methyltransferase activity induce higher type I IFN production than viruses with 2\u2032\u2010O\u2010methyltransferase activity through MDA5, suggesting that this RNA modification at the 5\u2032 end is important for evasion of innate immune recognition (67). MDA5 is likely to recognize viral RNA at the replication step before genomic RNA is masked by the 5\u2032 end modification enzyme. To support this speculation, RIG\u2010I was shown to recognize the viral genome at the replication step alongside the competing virus capping protein. Other RNA viruses such as influenza virus do not have a 5\u2032\u2010phosphatase, but instead the 5\u2032 end in genomic RNA is capped by the flu polymerase (68, 69). The RNA in the influenza genome is capped at the 5\u2032 end and this mechanism probably protects it from RIG\u2010I interaction (59).",

E3 ubiquitin ligase tripartite motif protein 25 (TRIM25) conjugates Lys\u201063\u2010linked ubiquitin to RIG\u2010I, enabling it to interact with an adapter protein IPS\u20101 (also known as MAVS, Cardif, and VISA) on mitochondria (70). Formation of RIG\u2010I and IPS\u20101 complexes induces the assembly of protein complexes to initiate downstream signaling (71, 72, 73). IPS\u20101 binds to TRAF3/6, caspase\u20108/10, RIP1, FAS\u2010associated death domain (FADD), and the TRADD (74, 75, 76). This complex induces activation of IKK\u03b1/\u03b2 followed by NF\u2010\u03baB activation, and TBK1/IKK\u03b9 that induce IRF3 activation, leading to production of inflammatory cytokines and type I IFNs, respectively (77, 78). The physiological role of the localization of IPS\u20101 in the mitochondrion is not yet clear, but several mitochondrial regulatory proteins are involved in signaling (79). NLRX1, an NLR family member localized on the mitochondrial membrane is an inhibitor of IPS\u20101 signaling (80, 81). Mitofusin 2, which is a regulator of mitochondrial fusion, suppresses IPS\u20101 signaling by direct interaction (82, 83). The importance of mitochondrial regulation is indirectly supported by experiments in mice that lack autophagy. It has been shown that ATG5\u2010 or ATG16L1\u2010deficient cells accumulate damaged mitochondria with IPS\u20101 and induce robust type I IFN induction (84, 85) (\nFig. 2\n).",

Moreover, mice with deficiency of negative regulators for TLR signals, such as SHP1 (109), A20 (110), TANK (111), and Zc3h12a (112), spontaneously develop autoimmune diseases by aberrant production of inflammatory cytokines and type I IFNs.",

However, structural differences, such as the high levels of unmethylated CpG motifs in viral DNA for TLR9 and clusters of U or GU\u2010rich sequences in viral RNA for TLR7, have been considered key factors in the discrimination between self and non\u2010self nucleic acids. In addition to sequence preference, all nucleic acid\u2010sensing TLRs are localized in the endosome and the specific localization in the cells clearly protects them from access to self\u2010nucleic acid (113, 114). Supporting these findings, several DNA\u2010binding proteins are proposed to facilitate the development of autoimmune and autoinflammatory diseases. LL37 was implicated in mediating TLR9 and TLR7 responses to self\u2010nucleic acids in psoriasis, a common chronic inflammatory disease in the skin (49, 115). LL37 was isolated from psoriasis patient samples accompanied by high level of IFN\u03b1 in pDCs. LL37 binds to self\u2010DNA and \u2010RNA, and protects it from degradation by DNase and facilitates internalization. HMBG1 is another protein that facilitates entry of self\u2010nucleic acids into cells by forming complexes. Initial reports have demonstrated that extracellular DNA released from dying cells in these complexes is recognized by TLR9 (116, 117). Several mechanisms for internalization process are proposed. One report demonstrated that HMGB1 associates with receptor for advanced glycosylation end products (RAGE), inducing endocytosis, and these binding complexes activate TLR9 in the endosome (117). Another report demonstrated that HMGB1 and the related family members HMGB2 and HMGB3 bind to DNA or RNA and activate TLRs and cytosolic nucleic sensors, capturing both self and non\u2010self nucleic acids to present them to sensors (48). In systematic autoimmune diseases such as SLE, scleroderma, and Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome, antibodies against self\u2010DNA complexed with DNA from dead cells are internalized by Fc\u03b3RII on B cells and DCs (118). The antibody complexes activate TLRs or cytosolic DNA sensors to produce an excess of type I IFNs, which precipitates the development and progression of systemic autoimmune diseases (\nFig. 3\n).",

Mice which have the homozygous LPR mutation (lpr/lpr) does not express the functional death receptor (FAS) and develop an SLE\u2010like disease (118). The lpr/lpr mice produce antibodies against self\u2010DNA or nucleic acid\u2010associated protein, and self\u2010antibody production is commonly used for evaluating the degree of the SLE phenotype. Initial study demonstrated a critical link between innate immunity and systemic autoimmunity in B cells (107). Consistent with the initial finding, lpr/lpr mice deficient in MyD88 do not produce autoantibody (108), but the contribution of TLR7 or TLR9 is controversial. TLR7 deficiency in lpr/lpr mice reduced the level of autoantibodies against RNA and RNA\u2010binding proteins and increased mouse survival. However, TLR9 deficiency in lpr/lpr mice also decreased autoantibody production against self\u2010DNA, facilitating disease level and increasing survival (119). Another SLE\u2010like disease mouse model, involving mutation of Ali5 that increases the function of phospholipase\u2010C\u03b32, also aggravated disease and increased production of self\u2010antibody, when crossed with TLR9\u2010deficient mice (120). The reason for unexpected difference in TLR9 is not clear, but one possible explanation is that the cytosolic DNA sensor is redundantly contributing to the production of self\u2010antibody. Recently DHX36 and DHX9 have been proposed as cytosolic DNA sensors that mediate a signal though MyD88 in the helicase domain (98). This function is supported by the demonstration of MyD88 dependency for self\u2010antibody production in lpr/lpr mice. The TLR7\u2010dependent signal might also be contributing to TLR9 activation in the lpr/lpr mice model (121). More direct evidence for the contribution of the TLR signal in SLE has been revealed by the discovery of a Y chromosome\u2010linked autoimmune accelerator (Yaa) mutation, causing an SLE\u2010like disease in mice. The Yaa mutation results from translocation of a 4 megabase translocation of the X chromosome to the Y chromosome, leading to a twofold increase in genes in the region containing TLR7 gene (122, 123). A later study shows that overexpression of TLR7 is sufficient for inducing an SLE\u2010like disease (124).",

Aberrant expression of type I IFNs is correlated with disease severity in SLE (118). Several processes for internalization of DNA\u2013antibody complexes have been proposed for the activation of TLRs. One major activation process is internalization through Fc\u03b3RIII or Fc\u03b3RII\u03b1 on the DCs, which are the main source of type I IFNs to develop disease in lpr/lpr mice (125, 126).

Blocking peptides specific to the Fc\u03b3R did not stimulate pDCs by immune complex from an SLE patient (127). The alternative process is internalization through the BCR\u2010mediated endocytosis pathway. B cells expressing an antigen receptor specific for self\u2010IgG internalize DNA\u2013IgG2\u03b1\u2013chromatin immune complexes by synergistic engagement of the antigen receptor (107) (\nFig. 3\n).",

Recent findings show that nucleic acid\u2010containing immune complexes activate NF\u2010\u03baB through TLR7 or TLR9, and activation of NF\u2010\u03baB is suppressed by glucocorticoid treatment (129).

Although the relationship between self\u2010nucleic acid recognition and disease onset in each autoimmune disease is difficult to establish from clinical evidence, several mouse models that display defects in self\u2010nucleic acid clearance show an autoimmune disease\u2010like phenotype. There are three types of mammalian DNases that mediate the degradation of self/non\u2010self DNA: DNase I, DNase II, and DNase III (TREX). DNase I is mainly present in serum and degrades extracellular dsDNA into tri\u2010 or tetra\u2010oligonucleotides (130). DNase I\u2010deficient mice develop glomerulonephritis, a feature of SLE. In humans, mutations in the dnase I gene are associated with SLE, and low DNase I activity is correlated with glomerulonephritis in patients (131). DNase II is present in the lysosomes of macrophages and is important for degradation of DNA derived from phagocytosed apoptotic cells. DNase II\u2010deficient mice induce accumulation of undigested DNA in macrophages, and the resulting production of IFN\u03b2 and TNF causes embryonic death (132). Embryonic lethality is rescued by type I IFN receptor deficiency (133), but the mouse still suffers arthritis by production of other proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF\u03b1, IL\u20101\u03b2, and IL\u20106. DNase III (Trex1), which is a 3\u2032 repair exonuclease, is localized in the cytosol, and is involved in clearance of cytosolic DNA from the retro element from self\u2010genome DNA (134). DNase III\u2010deficient mice increase production of inflammatory cytokines and type I IFNs probably through activation of an intracellular DNA sensor. DNA intrinsically accumulated in the cells by dysregulation of clearance is related to autoimmunity and Aicardi\u2010Goutieres syndrome in humans (135, 136). However, a sensor for accumulated DNA by dysregulation of the relevant DNases has not been demonstrated. DNA derived from DNase II\u2010deficient mice produce cytokines independently on MyD88 and TRIF (137). As with self\u2010DNA clearance, dysregulation of self\u2010RNA clearance by mutations in SAMHD1, an RNase H2 subunit, is also associated with Aicardi\u2010Goutieres syndrome (138).
