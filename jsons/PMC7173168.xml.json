            "text": "Antimicrobial resistance is a condition when microorganisms like bacteria, fungi, viruses and parasites change themselves when exposed to various antimicrobial drugs in such a way that the drug is rendered ineffective. These drugs are being used since 1940s and they have been successful in treating various infections. Long-term usage, inadequate dosage, frequency and evolvability of microbes have resulted in the development of resistance against these drugs. These resistant organisms are the major concern of present world as they are difficult to treat due to longer duration of treatment and quite expensive drugs. Infections caused by resistant organisms may also result in relapse of the disease, disability or death since new resistance mechanisms are evolving at a very high rate (\u201cCDC-drug resistance,\u201d n.d., \u201cWHO-antimicrobial resistance,\u201d n.d.). The mechanism of resistance development may be broadly classified in three categories as in intrinsic resistance, acquired resistance and adaptive resistance. Intrinsic resistance involves such mechanisms, which are intrinsic to microbes, and they act by lowering the concentration of drug inside the cell by either decreasing the uptake of drug or their extrusion by efflux pumps. Here, we will be focusing on various efflux pumps in brief. A resistance resulting from mutation or horizontal gene transfer of resistance genes is referred to as acquired resistance. It may be achieved either by degrading the antimicrobial drug or by modifying and hence protecting the drug target. In some cases, an antimicrobial drug may interact with the other drug or proteins and may result in an induction of a gene thereby causing resistance. Such type of resistance is named as adaptive resistance (Hughes and Andersson, 2017). Of these above mechanisms, resistance mediated by efflux pumps is clinically referred to as the most significant mode of resistance.",

ABC efflux pumps are primary active transporters utilizing ATP hydrolysis as the energy source for extrusion. SMR, PACE, MATE, MFS and RND pumps acts as secondary active transporters since they use proton motive force (PMF) or sodium ion gradient as their energy source (Munita and Arias, 2016; Spengler and Amaral, 2017).",

            "text": "SMR transporters are the smallest efflux pumps having 100\u2013120 amino acid length and four transmembrane helices (TMH). They generally function as homodimers and are found in bacteria and archaeabacteria. SMR family proteins transport lipophilic compounds and a variety of antibiotics (Bay et al., 2008; Spengler and Amaral, 2017). PACE family proteins are most commonly found in proteobacteria's effluxing various synthetic biocides like chlorhexidine, dequalinium, benzalkonium, proflavine, acriflavine, etc. (Hassan et al., 2015). MFS efflux pumps constitute a large family of transporters, which are ubiquitously expressed in all kingdoms of life. They transport a diverse variety of substrates like ions, oligosaccharides, amino acids, small metabolites, and various antimicrobial agents. These proteins consist of 12 TMH grouped in two six helices thereby forming a dimer like structure with a length of 400\u2013600 amino acid residues (Blanco et al., 2016; Spengler and Amaral, 2017). MATE family or multi antimicrobial extrusion proteins function as drug/sodium or proton antiporters found in bacteria, archaea as well as eukaryotes. The length of the members of this protein family ranges from 400 to 700 amino acid residues with 12 TMH. MATE transporters can extrude various antimicrobial agents like norfloxacin, chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, kanamycin, ampicillin, metformin, cimetidine, ethidium and triethylammonium (Kuroda and Tsuchiya, 2009). RND efflux pumps acts as proton/drug antiporters and exists primarily in gram negative bacteria, although they are also found in gram positive bacteria, archaea and eukaryotes. One of the largest superfamily of efflux proteins is that of the primary transporters, ATP binding cassette (ABC) transport proteins, utilizing ATP hydrolysis as their energy source. ABC proteins are also known as orphan proteins as they efflux a large range of molecules like ions, phospholipids, small molecules, antibiotics etc. (Spengler and Amaral, 2017). In this review, we will be discussing about various strategies used to fight with antimicrobial resistant superbugs. We have focused on (Efflux Pump Inhibitors) EPIs and AMPs (Anti-microbial Peptides) and how they can be used for targeting efflux pumps.",

Comparatively, gram-negative bacteria are more prone to resistance because of the presence of large periplasmic space along with an outer membrane. The drug is sequestered by efflux pump directly from the periplasm and extruded out even before they reach the cytoplasm (Mahamoud et al., 2007).",

            "text": "A nonapeptide derived from Polymyxin B was found to be effective when tested with erythromycin-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae. This peptide conjugate acts by increasing the permeability of bacterial outer membrane for hydrophobic antibiotics (Tsubery et al., 2005). Compounds targeting proton motive force required for the functioning of efflux pumps like verapamil and reserpine can also be used to increase the efficacy of antibiotics. The major disadvantage of using these compounds is that the concentration required for their effectiveness can be neurotoxic. Even, the chemically synthesized derivatives of these compounds were ineffective due to their stability and solubility issues along with high cost of purification and synthesis (Li et al., 2004). Many research groups have used peptidomimetics approach either for altering or inhibiting the function of efflux pumps. Based on this, Microcide and Daiichi Pharmaceuticals have developed a large family of peptidomimetics exhibiting properties of efflux pump inhibitors. The first member of this family was MC-207 110 alternatively known as phenylalanine arginyl \u03b2-naphthylamide (PA \u03b2 N). In P. aeruginosa resistant clinical strains, it was able to restore the levofloxacin susceptibility. Various structural derivatives of MC-207 110 as well as pyridopyrimidines have shown promising results in inhibiting efflux pumps of P. aeruginosa in invitro conditions. These EPIs (efflux pump inhibitors) failed in clinical trials owing to their toxicity (Mahamoud et al., 2007). Screening procedures with E. aerogenes strains and K. pneumoniae have led to the discovery of new class of EPIs namely, Quinoline derivatives. These compounds were successful in making resistant strains susceptible to chloramphenicol, tetracycline and norfloxacin. The derivatives with wide variety of side chains like alkylamino-, alkoxy-, thioalkoxy-, chloro-quinoline etc. showed promising results in structure-activity relationship analysis. They also have an advantage with an efficient pharmacokinetic profile as well as least side effect on permeabilization and alteration of membrane function. However, pharmacodynamics and cytotoxicity studies along with invivo studies are needed to check the actual therapeutic application of these compounds (Chevalier et al., 2004; Gallo et al., 2003). Arylpiperidines and arylpiperazines and their derivatives like N-methylpyrrolidone have shown resistance reversal effect in Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus, Acinetobacter baumannii and some species of Enterobacteriaceae (Bohnert and Kern, 2005; Kern et al., 2006; Pannek et al., 2006). Apart from these compounds, a new emerging class is of antimicrobial peptides or AMPs. They include natural occurring peptides as well as their synthetic derivatives with a broad spectrum of targets. Antibacterial AMPs are amongst the most studied ones. These can be cationic or amphipathic in nature, thereby, easy to interact with lipid bilayer hence targeting bacterial cell membrane. Nisin (an AMP) when administered with ramoplanin or chloramphenicol was able to restore sensitivity against methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin resistant enterococci (VRE). However, significant investigation is still required before reaching for clinical trials (Bahar and Ren, 2013; Brumfitt, 2002).",

Compared to antibacterial resistance, antifungal resistance is a major problem in immuno-compromised individuals, which can be lethal. The efficacy of commonly used antifungals like fluconazole, ketoconazole, itraconazole, voriconazole, benomyl, methotrexate, etc. is decreasing mostly due to overexpression of efflux pumps. The efflux pumps responsible for multidrug resistance are ABC and MFS transporters. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, multidrug resistance is known as pleiotropic drug resistance (PDR) and is the best understood mechanism. Most of the fungal drug resistance is studied with ABC and MFS transporter homologues in S. cerevisiae (Monk and Goffeau, 2008). FK506, propafenones, terbinafine, GP382 were found to be effective on azole resistant baker yeast as well as strains of C. albicans (Schuetzer-Muehlbauer et al., 2003). The antifungal AMPs belonging to all structural classes like alpha-helical, extended as well as beta-sheet are found. These AMPs (like D-V13K, P18, indolicin, defensins, etc.) mostly target fungal cell membrane and are effective even against resistant fungal cells (Bahar and Ren, 2013).",

Most of these viral strains are a result of either acquired or adaptive resistance. There is no room for intrinsic resistance. Antiviral AMPs acts either by causing membrane instability or reduction in host-virus interaction. Such a mechanism is utilized by defensin (an AMP) to render HSV unable to bind host cells (Yasin et al., 2004). Some antiviral AMPs like lactoferrin, prevent HSV infection by blocking virus-receptor interactions (Jenssen et al., 2004). In a recent study, a research group has discovered non-peptidic small molecule cyclophilin inhibitors with potent antiviral activity against hepatitis C virus, HIV and coronaviruses (Ahmed-Belkacem et al., 2016).",

            "text": "Leishmania is one of the most neglected microbes causing leishmaniasis, endemic in over 98 countries across the globe. Many strains of parasite have been found which are resistant against the most recommended drugs like antimonials, miltefosine, amphotericin B, pentamidine, paromomycin, sitamaquine, etc. One of the major causes of development of resistance against these drugs is their irregular and inappropriate use in the endemic regions (Singh et al., 2012). Various invitro experiments have suggested that the drug resistant strains of L. donovani show decreased accumulation of miltefosine. This effect may be due to involvement of either an ABC transporter protein P-glycoprotein (Pgp or ABCB1) which may increase the drug efflux or a decrement in the drug uptake by the organisms which is contributed by two proteins, miltefosine transporter LdMT, a P4ATPase and its beta subunit LdROS3 (Perez-Victoria et al., 2006). A large number of ABC transporters have been identified so far, of which proteins belonging to three subfamilies; Multi Drug Resistance P-glycoprotein (P-gp, ABCB1), Multidrug Resistance associated Protein 1 (MRP1, ABCC1) and Breast Cancer Resistance Protein (BRCP, ABCG2); are believed to play an important role in drug efflux and hence multidrug resistance phenomenon (Ferreira et al., 2015). The ABC transporter, Pgp, consists of four domains: two transmembrane domains (TMDs) and two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs) arranged in a head to tail fashion. Each TMD consist of 6 helices and are capable of recognizing a wide variety of substrates. NBDs consist of a larger (catalytic sub domain) and a smaller domain. The Walker A motif (GXXGXGKS/T) and Walker B motif (\u03a6\u03a6\u03a6\u03a6D) are part of this domain. The smaller helical domain has conserved ABC signature motif or C-motif (LSGGQ) (Dawson and Locher, 2006).",

Due to increased drug selectivity, reduced toxicity and compatibility with the target protein structures AMPs, for example, dermaseptins, cecropins, melettin, etc., have been described as a first line of defense against pathogen invasion, including protozoa (Hopkins and Groom, 2002; Lynn et al., 2011; Mangoni et al., 2005; Marr et al., 2016; Toro et al., 2013; Ruiz-Santaquiteria et al., 2017) and are under intense investigation to improve their druggability. Their mode of action involves the perturbation of protozoan homeostasis by directly disrupting the cellular membranes, interaction and interference with key processes in the parasite metabolism (Afacan et al., 2012; Jenssen et al., 2006; Torrent et al., 2012b). Various experimental and computational platforms have been proposed to develop more efficient AMPs (Fjell et al., 2012; Hilpert et al., 2005; Lata et al., 2007; Torrent et al., 2012a, 2009; Wang, 2004). Synthetic AMPs have also been designed and were found to be effective for treating canine leishmaniasis (Alberola et al., 2004). But their success has been restricted to invitro conditions only. None of these have succeeded in invivo or in clinical trials. Besides, their antimicrobial role, AMPs are also involved in chemotaxis and redox homeostasis with rapid radical scavenging ability (Cole et al., 2003; Com et al., 2003; Ganz, 2002; Liu et al., 2010; Zhao et al., 2011). Recently, the metagenomic approaches are extensively reviewed to explore the role of AMPs in redox homeostasis (Champion and Xu, 2017).",

Another strategy to combat resistance is targeting redox metabolism pathway of microbes by the identification of novel targets using systems biology approaches (Fig. 3\n). Although, the host provides survival advantages to the parasites by offering unlimited nutritional supply, the environmental change also entails potential risks from host defense in which the parasite has to undergo tremendous oxidative stress that has to be neutralized. For their survival, maintenance of redox homeostasis is of principal importance. Parasitic redox metabolism has gained greater interests due to their distinctive redox systems in comparison to their hosts (Salinas, 2013).",

            "text": "In decade's long battle between microbes and drugs, it seems like microbes have evolved into superbugs to defeat humans. They have developed various mechanisms to keep antimicrobials far away from them. Amongst vast mechanisms, the most studied and targeted are those involving efflux pumps. Microbes exhibit resistance for drugs either by overexpression of efflux pumps hence causing an increase in the efflux; or in some cases they may enhance the activity of these efflux pumps either by mutating some genes or causing some allosteric changes. Whatever be the mechanism, the end result is less accumulation of drug inside the microbes. The need of the hour is to find new strategies to make these super bugs again susceptible for the drugs. A doable method is to target efflux pumps by minimizing pump expression or decrease in affinity for drug binding or directly inhibiting pump activity. Many research groups have contributed in developing EPIs and AMPs so that the existing antimicrobial agents can be reused based on combinatorial therapy. The reason for their failure in invivo or in clinical trials is that mostly potential antimicrobial agents are being tested on laboratory generated resistant strains. We should focus more on testing on resistant isolates from patient samples. This will decrease the failure rate in clinical trials. Further additional efforts must be made to design EPIs or rather small peptides that would specifically target efflux pump of a particular type of microbe. These specific small peptides may be designed either to inhibit a pump or to allosterically modulate and thereby decreasing its activity. Peptides acting allosterically on a specific pump will minimize the possibility of resistance. Instead, they will contribute mostly in making microbes susceptible again for the existing antimicrobial agents. Targeting redox metabolism pathway of microbes using systems genomics approaches serves as another strategy, discussed above. These approaches may help in avoiding drug tolerance as well as efflux pump mediated resistance.",
