With laboratory automation, it may be best to prioritize FTEs by assay bench or analyzer as prioritization of individual tests would require additional work of scrutinizing and separating orders, and sorting, storing, and re-running a large number of samples. It may be most efficient to simply allow an automation line to run the complete battery of tests ordered unless analyte-specific technical issues arise. In times of particularly critical shortages of staff and/or reagents, with proper agreement of hospital leadership and use of mass notification mechanisms, non-emergent tests could be temporarily masked from providers in the test ordering system and eliminate the laboratory from receiving them in the first place.",

The lab should prepare for an increased number of mechanically ventilated patients. Hospital leadership can provide details about the plans to expand patient care areas for COVID-19 patients and the expected testing volumes.

Table 1 . Example contingency planning FTE assignment tool. Using the Chemistry section as an example, a similar contingency planning tool can be used across core clinical lab specialties to assess benches/testing that can be performed depending upon available staffing. Its design affords managers to use this tool daily to assign benches, considering priority of assays and specimen stability for assays that are batched. Notably, increased risks of staffing concerns are seen on off-shifts (weekend days, evenings, and nights) and may be addressed by identifying staff who would volunteer to be on-call to cover these shifts as needed. A similar tool can be used to automate communication within the department and help reallocate staffing where it is needed, while also providing updates to clinical care teams. Data for the Chemistry section is offered as an example of information to collect, which is dependent on testing volumes, breadth of testing offered, as well other lab-specific needs.
