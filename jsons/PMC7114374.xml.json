Clinical findings commonly observed in the FIP-like disease in ferrets include anorexia, weight loss, diarrhea and the presence of large palpable intra-abdominal masses. Strikingly similar to FIP is the presence of widespread granulomas on serosal surfaces and within the parenchyma of the abdominal and thoracic organs. Histopathologic examination shows a systemic pyogranulomatous inflammation involving the mesenteric adipose tissue, lymph nodes, liver, lungs, kidney, spleen, pancreas and adrenal glands. Moreover, the immunohistochemical detection of coronavirus antigen in the cytoplasm of intra-lesional macrophages is consistent with what has been observed in tissues of cats with FIP.",

A unique 599-bp partial spike sequence of the ferret systemic coronavirus (FRSCV) was derived and analyzed. This sequence was found to be more similar (77% deduced amino acid sequence similarity) to the previously described (Wise et al., 2006) ferret enteric coronavirus (FRECV) than to other group 1 coronaviruses, feline coronavirus, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) of swine and canine coronavirus (CCV) (71\u201373% deduced amino acid sequence similarities). FRECV is associated with a different disease in ferrets, epizootic catarrhal enteritis (ECE) (Williams et al., 2000). ECE is a highly contagious diarrheal disease of ferrets associated with a mortality rate of <5%. When first recognized, the disease was more severe in older ferrets but often mild and subclinical in juveniles. We previously characterized FRECV, and found it to be a novel group 1 coronavirus (Wise et al., 2006), based upon analyses of partial sequences of the polymerase (pol), spike (S) and membrane (M) protein genes and the complete sequence of the nucleocapsid (N) gene. This study is the first report on the genetic relationship between one systemic (FRSCV MSU-1) and one enteric (FRECV MSU-2) ferret coronavirus strain, based upon a comparative analysis of their 3\u2032-most 8.3\u20138.6 kb genomic sequences.",

Partial sequence was also derived from the 3\u2032 untranslated region (UTR) of the genome. The genomic organization observed for each virus was consistent with that of a typical coronavirus. Each intact gene was preceded, a few nucleotides upstream its 5\u2032 end, by the recognized consensus transcription-regulating sequence (TRS), 5\u2032-CTAAAC-3\u2032, of coronaviruses (Budzilowicz et al., 1985, Horsburgh et al., 1992, Kapke and Brian, 1986, Snijder et al., 2003, Spaan et al., 1988). In both viruses, the TRS for the E and 7b genes each exhibited a one-base mismatch at the 5\u2032 end, appearing as 5\u2032-GTAAAC-3\u2032 for the former, and 5\u2032-TTAAAC-3\u2032 for the latter. The highly conserved 10-base sequence, 5\u2032-GGGAAGAGCT-3\u2032, found in the 3\u2032 UTR of all coronaviruses, was also noted, both in FRSCV and FRECV. Reminiscent of the observation made for FRECV MSU-1 (Wise et al., 2006), the 10-base sequence was found 170 bases downstream ORF 7b and had the same 2 base mismatches, a T instead of a G in the first base, and a G instead of an A at the seventh base.",

This deletion results to the splitting of ORF 3 into two shorter ORFs in FRSCV WADL\u2014a proximal ORF, expressing a putative protein of 98 amino acids with a start site similar to that of FRECV MSU-2, and a distal ORF that translates into a 110 amino acid protein, whose ATG corresponds to position 420 in FRECV MSU-2 (Fig. 4). ORF 3 region sequences of systemic strains FRSCV WADL and MSU-S were highly similar at 95.5%. The corresponding ORF 3 region sequence of FRSCV MSU-1 appeared more distant with an average identity of only 85.75% to either systemic strain.

            "text": "Ferret systemic coronavirus causes signs and lesions that are similar to those induced by FIPV in cats. The partial S protein sequence we initially derived from a FRSCV strain (Garner et al., 2008), was the first indicator that this virus appeared to be more similar to ferret enteric coronavirus than to any other group 1 coronavirus. The question then arose as to whether FRSCV strains could have evolved from FRECV by in vivo mutation, leading to the acquisition of a systemic virulent pathotype. The analogous situation in cats is enteric feline coronavirus infection, which causes a mild or asymptomatic localized enteric infection (Pedersen, 2009, Evermann et al., 1991, Rottier, 1999, Weiss and Navas-Martin, 2005, Addie et al., 2004) and the systemic highly fatal disease FIP, considered to be derived by spontaneous mutation during FCoV persistence (Evermann et al., 1991, Rottier, 1999, Weiss and Navas-Martin, 2005, Addie et al., 2004, De Groot-Mijnes et al., 2005, Poland et al., 1996, Vennema et al., 1998, Herrewegh et al., 1995, Rottier et al., 2005, Lai et al., 2007, Pedersen, 2009, Chang et al., 2009). The mutation from FCoV to FIPV is accompanied by a marked acquisition of macrophage tropism (Pedersen, 1987, Stoddart and Scott, 1989), which facilitates systemic spread (Rottier et al., 2005, Lai et al., 2007, Pedersen, 1987). The precise nature of this phenomenon is not entirely understood (Lai et al., 2007). In fact, enteric FCoVs and their counterpart FIPVs were observed to be genetically very similar (Poland et al., 1996, Herrewegh et al., 1995, Vennema et al., 1998), bearing only minor but crucial differences (Pedersen, 2009). Candidate genes speculated to play a role in the virulence shift include the S and group-specific genes 3abc, 7b and 7a (Haijema et al., 2004, Vennema et al., 1998, Kennedy et al., 2001). Using targeted RNA recombination, Rottier et al. (2005) have shown that the C-terminal 582-amino acid region of the FIPV 79\u20131146 S protein contains the amino acid changes that determine macrophage tropism. In this region of the S protein, a total of only 10 amino acid differences were noted between FIPV 79 and 1146 and its close relative, enteric strain FCoV 79\u20131683. A \u201cD-to-A\u201d substitution, upstream of the putative fusion peptide, was speculated to play a role in the transition of FCoV to FIPV. Pedersen (2009), in a comprehensive review of FIPV infection, states that mutation in the 3c gene is responsible for the FIP biotype. Similarly, Chang et al. (2009) analyzed the 3c gene in 27 feline enteric coronavirus (FECV)- and 28 FIPV-infected cats and found that the 3c gene was mutated in the majority (71.4%) of the cats with FIP.",

To resolve this, a significant number of additional strains from the same or different locations will have to be examined. It is also not clear at this point whether FRSCV originated as a result of a recombination between FRECV and another group 1 coronavirus, resulting in the acquisition of a very distinct S gene. A 3\u2032\u20135\u2032 scanning of the nucleotide sequence alignment for the two virus strains did not show an abrupt discontinuity in identity at the 3\u2032 end of the S gene that would have been an indication of recombination. We noticed instead an increase in sequence divergence starting at the 200 bases adjacent to the 3\u2032 end of the S gene, within the ORF 3 gene region (nucleotide positions 1\u2013200 in Fig. 4), that gave a sequence similarity of only 75.5%. This of course does not discount the possibility that a recombination event may have involved the proximal portion of the ORF 3 gene region as well. BLAST analysis of the S sequence of FRSCV MSU-1 against reported sequences only showed FRECV MSU-1, the previously described enteric ferret coronavirus strain (Wise et al., 2006), as the one with the most significant similarity to it. If recombination in the S gene did occur, giving rise to FRSCV, the donor coronavirus strain is yet to be discovered. An example of this phenomenon is type II FCoV, which originated from a double recombination between FCoV type I and canine coronavirus (CCV) (Motokawa et al., 1996, Herrewegh et al., 1998).",

Whether this difference is associated with pathotype is not clear. In vivo experiments would be an obvious way to resolve this issue, but are hampered by the difficulty of growing either virus in cell culture. Another observation was that the partial S gene sequences from at least 3 different FRSCV strains, collected from different locales, were distinct from 3 different FRECV strains that also originated from different places (Fig. 1). Whether this pattern would hold up with a larger sample size remains to be determined. The two genotype-specific RT-PCR assays developed in this study would certainly be useful molecular tools to expand the current data.",

According to Pedersen (2009), mutation in the ORF 3c gene is responsible for the FIPV biotype and that FCoVs of the enteric biotype possess an intact 3c gene. It is thought that a loss of 3c gene function enhances the internalization and replication of FIPVs in macrophages (Dewerchin et al., 2005). Pedersen (2009) explains that the mutations could either be SNPs which lead to premature stop codons or deletion mutations that significantly truncate the 3c gene product. In agreement to this are the findings of Chang et al. (2009) where mutations in the 3c gene were found in a majority (71.4%), of FIPV strains examined, while the gene was intact in 100% of analyzed FECVs. This lead to the conclusion that mutation in 3c cannot be the sole cause of FIP. In the ferret strains we analyzed, both systemic and enteric biotypes possess a single ORF 3 protein. The 3c-like protein in FRSCV MSU-1 was significantly truncated in comparison to FRECV MSU-2, prompting us to explore other systemic and enteric strains. Our findings show that the ferret coronaviruses have high sequence variability in ORF 3, even among strains of the same pathotype. A deletion in the 3c-like gene, giving rise to a truncated protein, was noted in two out of three systemic strains examined, while an intact ORF 3 was noted in the two enteric strains analyzed. Again, with the limited number of strains studied so far, it is not clear whether the mutation in gene 3 plays a role in the systemic nature of FRSCVs.",

We provide molecular evidence showing that systemic strain, FRSCV MSU-1, is more closely related to enteric strain, FRECV MSU-2, than to any other group 1 coronavirus, in all structural and nsp genes examined. One important observation was that these two virus strains differed significantly in the S gene. It is conceivable that FRSCV and FRECV are genetically distinctive coronaviruses of ferrets, a hypothesis already supported by Brown et al. (2009) in the case of FCoVs. On the other hand, it is also possible that the in vivo mutation theory of Chang et al. (2009) and Pedersen (2009) applies to the ferret coronaviruses. Analysis of more strains of each virus pathotype is certainly needed to either substantiate or modify either of these two concepts.",
