            "text": "Hepatitis E virus (HEV) (Hepeviridae family) is one of a number of divergent isolates from humans and other animals (Song et al., 2014) whose taxonomic status is unresolved. This infection is endemic in many parts of the US, Central and parts of South America, Mediterranean regions of Europe, Africa and Asia Pacific region (Perez-Gracia et al., 2013). The clinical course of genotype 3 (G3) infection is usually self-limited in immunocompetent individuals (Rodriguez-Frias et al., 2012). In contrast, chronic and fulminant infections in patients coinfected with human immunodeficiency virus (Dalton et al., 2011), with iatrogenic immunosuppression or with solid organ transplantation (Kamar et al., 2008) have been described as well as severe acute infections in pregnant women (Mateos Lindemann et al., 2010). In fact, 60% of HEV infections in immunocompromised patients after solid organ transplantation evolve to chronic infection without antiviral treatment (Fujiwara et al., 2014). HEV infection has been reported to be associated with allogeneic hematopoietic transplantation (Versluis et al., 2013), or with transplantation of solid organs such as the liver (Te et al., 2013), kidney (Passos et al., 2013, Moal et al., 2013) and heart (Koning et al., 2013). Cases of HEV transmission due to transfusions (Price, 2014) have also been noted. A case has recently been described from Germany in which a low HEV G3 viral load was transmitted by platelets to an immunocompromised patient who subsequently developed chronic hepatitis (Huzly et al., 2014).",

            "text": "The HEV genome is an ss+RNA of approximately 7.2 kb, including three partially overlapping open reading frames, from 5\u2032 to 3\u2032: ORF1, ORF2 and ORF3, these structures are thought to be important for HEV RNA replication (Reyes et al., 1993). ORF1 encodes a 1693 amino acids (AAs) long polyprotein that has structural and functional motifs responsible for viral replication: methyltransferase, papain-like cysteine protease (PCP), helicase and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) (Ahmad et al., 2011). However, some uncharacterized domains homologous with other animal and plant RNA positive-strand viruses are also found within the ORF1 protein. These include the Y domain, the X domain (formerly the macro domain) and a polyproline or hypervariable region (Holla et al., 2013). ORF2 encodes a 660 AAs protein which is the main component of the viral capsid (Zafrullah et al., 1999). The capsid is formed by the interaction of ORF2 protein dimers with the 5\u2032 end of the viral genome through its N-terminal region, which is rich in arginine (AA 101; 180 molecules of proORF2 per virus particle) (Xing et al., 2010). This protein has three linear domains: the S domain, which forms the capsid, and the M and P domains, which are involved in the interaction of the virus with the host cell (Perez-Gracia et al., 2014). It has been described an homologous to alphavirus region (46 AAs long) of unknown function (Yarbough et al., 1991, Purdy et al., 1993, Rodriguez-Frias et al., 2012). The ORF3 protein probably regulates the host cell environment through its interaction with various intracellular pathways. Firstly, it activates the ERK by binding and inhibiting their phosphatase. Prolonged activation of ERK would generate a survival and proliferative cellular sign that can favor viral replication and extend the life of infected cells by attenuating the intrinsic pathway of death. Secondly, the innate immune response is downregulated by reducing acute phase protein expression and increasing secretion of \u03b11-microglobulin with immunosuppressive capacity (Chandra et al., 2008). The ORF3 protein interacts with ORF2. This interaction is dependent upon the phosphorylation of serine 71, and suggests a role for ORF3 protein in regulating the assembly of HEV and the possible location of the virus capsid (Tyagi et al., 2002).",

Despite its undeniable epidemiological and clinical significance, some technical issues, such as its adaptation to culture in vitro, have presented obstacles to researchers. Since Koonin and colleagues (Koonin et al., 1992) first described its genomic structure in 1992, there have been no significant advances in our understanding of the genome structure; the sequence published by this group is still used as a reference by many researchers. Thus, our method should contribute to the knowledge of the HEV genome, as it enables direct and sensitive amplification of the complete coding genome from clinical samples, unlike most published methods, which have been standardized for use after HEV has been grown in cell culture e.g. (Tanaka et al., 2007). Our system would allow clinical samples (of serum or feces) to be used to analyze the complete sequence in human HEV infections of particular interest to public health; for instance comparative genome analysis of chronic and acute infections could be done. Furthermore, it is important to have highly sensitive research tools to investigate HEV transmission by blood products, since this is known to be possible with low viral loads (Huzly et al., 2014). To date, the only complete HEV genome sequences available in databases from Spanish research groups correspond to viruses found in pigs (EU723513, EU723516 and EU723515) (Peralta et al., 2009). There are few reports in which the HEV genome has been analyzed in immunocompromised patients (Lhomme et al., 2014b).",

From the analysis of our reference sequences, we have brought to light that methyltransferase, PCP and helicase present numerous polymorphic AA positions. Viral methyltransferase is essential for HEV replication and infectivity, and is required for efficient binding of mRNA to ribosomes as well as for avoiding the innate immune response mediated by interferon (Pichlmair et al., 2006). Heterogeneity of the second AA of the PCP putative catalytic site (Tyr/Cys), imprecision in the function and limits for the region that has been proposed but not confirmed as being a functional protease (Suppiah et al., 2011), together with its low level of conservation, highlights the need for functional studies in relation to this protein. Conversely, conservation of RdRp I\u2013VIII motifs including the GDD sequence that binds Mg2+, which is essential for replication, is consistent with its proposed key functional role (Koonin, 1991). Two described domains are still not functionally characterized at present. Of these, the Y domain is highly conserved in our analysis, suggesting that an important function is located in this region, although little is known about it. In the case of the X or macro domain, although its function is unclear, it is analogous to other viral genomes that are better known as coronaviruses (Koonin et al., 1992). It may not be essential for replication, given its high tolerance to polymorphic AAs. The macro domain is known to be involved in the inflammation process in animal models, and influences viral pathogenicity by substitution of a conserved AA residue that is responsible for the reduced secretion of inflammatory cytokines. However, this function has not been described in the case of HEV (Lhomme et al., 2014b).",

This region seems to be of special interest because of its potential relationship with the infectivity of HEV G3 in various animal species (Purdy et al., 2012), as well as because of its possible relationship with immune control and viral persistence (Lhomme et al., 2014b). Future studies of cases of chronic infection could provide useful information about the significance of this region.

            "text": "The analysis of the IC sequence indicates that the sequence from feces was fully representative of that from serum, making molecular analysis more feasible when serum samples are scarce. Methyltransferase and the Y domain showed no mutations with respect to the consensus. In contrast, PCP, the X domain, helicase and RdRp had 1, 3, 3 and 9 AA substitutions, respectively. Mutations accumulate predominantly in the intermediate portion of the RdRp, presumably being located outside the protein's active site, although the previously described III and IV motifs (Koonin, 1991) are affected. Conversely, the 3\u2032 region and the GDD functional motif described as keys for replication (Agrawal et al., 2001) is fully conserved. The data provided by (Lhomme et al., 2014a) suggest that the proline-rich region has an important role in the persistence of the infection. The studied IC sequence harbors neither insertion nor deletions in this genome region, which may be to do with the resolution of the infection. Future research on immunocompromised patients becoming persistently infected would provide data on the molecular basis of HEV persistence. ORF2 and ORF3 domains present no or single AA substitutions, with the exception of the N-terminal portion of S domain, which accumulates six mutations. We hypothesize that these differences in the capsid protein might be related to morphological or functional features, but they must surely represent phylogenetic differences relative to the reference sequences in terms of sub-genotype. Finally, we found a mutation in the IC sequence of the PXXP motifs of the P2 region associated with virus release (Pawson, 1995). Future directed mutation analysis might investigate the effect of this specific substitution on virus release.",
