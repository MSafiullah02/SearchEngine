HBoV was first isolated in 2005 from nasopharyngeal specimens from children with respiratory tract infections [Allander et al., 2005]. HBoV, a small non\u2010enveloped virus with an approximately 5 kb single\u2010stranded DNA genome is classified in the family Parvoviridae, subfamily Parvovirinae, and genus Bocavirus. Since it was first identified, HBoV has been detected worldwide in respiratory samples. Several studies have shown that HBoV is associated with acute respiratory tract infections in young children, with a reported worldwide prevalence ranging from 1.5% to 19% [Bastien et al., 2006; Allander et al., 2007; Fry et al., 2007].",

HBoV2 was discovered in the stool of children with non\u2010polio acute flaccid paralysis in Pakistan [Kapoor et al., 2009]. Soon thereafter, HBoV3 and HBoV4 were identified in the stools of children with diarrhoea in Australia and the USA [Arthur et al., 2009; Kapoor et al., 2010]. To date, HBoV1 has been linked most frequently with respiratory tract illness, particularly in children [Bastien et al., 2006; Kesebir et al., 2006; Allander et al., 2007; Fry et al., 2007; Maggi et al., 2007], although it has also been detected in stool samples to a lesser extent [Albuquerque et al., 2007; Lau et al., 2007; Lee et al., 2007]. In contrast, HBoV2 occurs rarely in respiratory samples, and instead is found primarily in the stools of children, indicating an association between HBoV2 and gastrointestinal disease [Arthur et al., 2009; Chieochansin et al., 2009; Han et al., 2009; Kapoor et al., 2009; Chow et al., 2010; Santos et al., 2010]. Interestingly, the identification of HBoV3 and HBoV4 is so recent that the epidemiology and clinical characteristics associated with these viruses are only now being realized [Arthur et al., 2009; Chieochansin et al., 2009; Kapoor et al., 2010; Santos et al., 2010].",

Patients who had immunocompromised conditions (e.g., current treatment of chemotherapy or immunosuppressive therapy, bone marrow transplantation or known primary immune deficiency) were all excluded from the study. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were obtained by suction using a fine, flexible plastic catheter and syringe and then immediately transported at 4\u00b0C to the laboratory, where they were stored at \u221270\u00b0C until use. Review of medical records, interviews at admission, and patient demographic and clinical data including medical history, detailed signs and symptoms, physical examination, and laboratory and radiology results were all collected. Disease severity was assessed according to a respiratory symptom scoring system based on a previously published metric. [Gern et al., 2002; Lemanske et al., 2005].",

These results are in close agreement with numerous previous studies [Kesebir et al., 2006; Fry et al., 2007; Maggi et al., 2007], which showed that most patients with HBoV infections are infants or children below 5 years of age. A previous seroepidemiologic study of HBoV showed that the seropositive rate in children aged under 3 months is 90.5%, but drops to 5.6% in children 6\u20138 months old, likely due to waning levels of maternally\u2010acquired antibodies [Endo et al., 2007]. The percentage of HBoV\u2010seropositive patients rebounds and increases with age, such that all children are exposed to HBoV by the age of six. One study [Kahn et al., 2008] showed that although 91.8% of infants \u22642 months old are HBoV\u2010seropositive, the seropositive rate is lowest (25.0%) in children aged 4 months, but is increased to >85% in children \u2265 48 months old. Together, these data suggest that infants younger than 4\u20136 months of age may be protected from HBoV infection by maternal antibodies, and that the first HBoV infection begins after the loss of maternal antibodies, with the majority of HBoV infections occurring very early in childhood. In addition, the lower rate of detection of HBoV in older children and adults, as reported in several studies [Allander et al., 2005, 2007; Fry et al., 2007; Lau et al., 2007; Han et al., 2009; Noh et al., 2013], may be due to life\u2010long immunity acquired from an infection early in childhood.",

            "text": "With respect to the clinical features of HBoV infection, the present study showed that HBoV\u2010positive children had a higher prevalence of prior wheezing history, a higher frequency of chest retraction and wheezing, higher respiratory symptom scores, and a longer duration of hospital stay compared with the HBoV\u2010negative group. These results are in agreement with previous studies reporting an association of HBoV with acute wheezing in children [Choi et al., 2006; Chung et al., 2006; Allander et al., 2007; Fry et al., 2007; Deng et al., 2012] as well as respiratory distress and hypoxia as main clinical characteristics of HBoV infection [Moriyama et al., 2010]. In addition, several studies have shown that HBoV is a cause of severe exacerbation of asthma in children [Naghipour et al., 2007; Vallet et al., 2009]. Although the impact of co\u2010infection with other viruses should be considered, results of this study showed that there were no significant differences in clinical features between children with HBoV infection alone and those co\u2010infected with another virus, implying that HBoV\u2010positive patients experience clinical severities such as respiratory distress, wheezing, and longer hospitalization regardless of co\u2010infection status. Deng et al. [2012] suggested that a high HBoV viral load could lead to longer duration of wheezing and hospitalization in children with severe lower respiratory tract infection, while co\u2010infection does not influence clinical severity and outcome of HBoV infection.",

Although recent reports have described an HBoV2\u20104 prevalence of 0.4\u20134.3% in respiratory specimens children [Han et al., 2009; Song et al., 2010; Koseki et al., 2012], the roles of HBoV2\u20104 in respiratory disease remain unclear. HBoV2\u20104 occurs rarely in respiratory samples but is fairy common in stools of children [Arthur et al., 2009; Chieochansin et al., 2009; Han et al., 2009; Kapoor et al., 2010, 2009; Chow et al., 2010; Santos et al., 2010], suggesting an association between HBoV2\u20104 and gastrointestinal disease. Results of the present study indicate that HBoV2\u20104 is not directly involved in respiratory tract infections. Further, it is presumed that HBoV2\u20104 is detected rarely in respiratory secretions originating from gastrointestinal mucosa due to contamination with oral secretions at the time of sampling, although further studies are needed to determine if HBoV2\u20104 are associated with clinical illness outside of the gastrointestinal tract.",

Based on these results, Lau et al. [2007] predicted that HBoV infections may occur only once because of the subsequent development of life\u2010long immunity conferred by neutralizing antibodies. In addition, it is postulated that HBoV1\u2010associated respiratory infections might have a homogenous pattern of clinical and epidemiologic features because of the low genetic diversity of HBoV1. In support of this possibility, the study results indicated that there were no significant differences with respect to both clinical and laboratory data between children with and without minor HBoV1 variations. Specifically, even though 23 strains with nucleotide variations out of 187 HBoV isolates was identified, only 2 of the 23 strains resulted in an amino acid substitution. Thus, the 21 strains with nucleotide variations were thought to have the same biologic characteristics as non\u2010mutated HBoV. In addition, the two strains with an amino acid substitution did not exhibit specific clinical features, suggesting they may not influence the biological action of HBoV. In contrast, several novel types of HBoV2\u20104, which were not detected in this study, exhibit a high degree of genetic diversity relative to HBoV1 [Arthur et al., 2009; Kapoor et al., 2010, 2009]. These findings suggest that HBoV2\u20104 and HBoV1 have different clinical impacts and support the above proposal that HBoV2\u20104 are not directly involved in respiratory disease.",

Second, quantification of viral loads, which would be useful to analyze co\u2010infection cases more clearly, was not measured. Third, there is the lack of an asymptomatic control group. Fourth, the evaluation of the causative agents of acute respiratory infections covered only 12 respiratory viruses, and other bacterial or viral pathogens which can cause acute respiratory illnesses were not investigated. Despite these shortcomings, these data should aid in the understanding of the role that HBoV plays in respiratory illness.",
