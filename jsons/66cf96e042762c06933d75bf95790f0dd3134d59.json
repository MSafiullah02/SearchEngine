This assumption is appropriate in a setting where endemic transmission of measles has been interrupted, as is the case for the U.S. (3), and it does not preclude an evaluation of trends in R over time. Importantly, upper confidence limits of these estimates may exceed 1, allowing for exclusion of the possibility of endemic transmission. In addition, point estimates of Rindex calculated using Method 4 may exceed 1.",

When this approach is applied to all chains of transmission, including those in which the imported primary case was not identified (e.g., a short-term visitor who left the country before developing symptoms), R may be overestimated, as you are essentially including non-imported cases without their associated importation. Thus, all analyses were conducted twice, either including or excluding chains without an identified imported source. These analyses showed that, except for Method 1, estimates of R and Rindex were generally larger when analyses were limited to chains with an identified imported source; excluding cases with an unknown source increases the proportion of total cases that are imported and yields a lower R for Method 1.",

            "text": "Larger outbreaks and those of longer duration may be more likely than smaller chains and single cases to be reported, which may affect R estimates using Methods 2 and 3. Similarly, smaller chains and singleton cases may be more likely to be false-positives. To account for this, R was estimated after discarding chains of transmission below a minimum size and duration; we considered minimum chain sizes of 1-5 cases and minimum chain duration from 0-4 generations of spread. These analyses showed that estimates of R based on the size of outbreaks were lower when single-case chains were included in the analysis, and increasingly larger as analyses were restricted to larger chain sizes (Supplementary Table 1 ). Estimates of R based on the duration of outbreaks were smaller when single-case chains were included in the analysis, but otherwise fairly constant (Supplementary Table 2 ).",
