The original deadline of June 2020 is currently delayed due to global responses to the Covid-19 pandemic, but an agreement is expected to be reached once normal activities resume. This has raised some concerns regarding the ability to support fishing sectors, but an effective agreement should be viewed as a proactive policy allowing for carefully designed transitions that, per the UN Sustainable Development Agenda, leave no one behind. Sustainable and equitable fisheries are essential for enabling additional SDGs including reducing poverty (SDG 1), providing nutritious food (SDG 2), and securing livelihoods (SDG 8) [2] , and failure to achieve an agreement would reduce confidence in our ability to advance the UN Sustainable Development Agenda. There are still important gaps in reaching consensus on a comprehensive and just agreement within the World Trade Organization (WTO) mandate [3] , but negotiators are actively engaged in discussions and need more attention from governments, fisher organizations, and civil society. The following aims to inform negotiations towards an effective agreement by providing evidence-based options for reform that highlight equity needs while reducing environmental harm [4] .",

Overcapacity (the existence of more fishing power than needed to take the maximum sustainable yield) leads to overfishing where management is lacking and to economic waste in any case. This lost potential value due to overcapacity is estimated at ~ US$83 billion per year [8] , and declines in fish stocks can cause collapses and cascading effects on ecosystems and economies that are difficult to recover from (e.g., Atlantic cod in North America). This issue is critical for regions that depend on seafood to reduce chronic malnourishment [9,10] (e.g., Africa's nutrition action plan to build 'grey matter infrastructure'). Subsidization of illegal fishing activity is especially worrisome given documented linkages with illicit trade and organized crime [11, 12] and can also create conflicts with legal fishers who see little benefit in abiding by the rules [13] .",

In the Indian Ocean, the proportion of tuna catch that is subsidized by different countries ranges from 10% to over 100%, yet quota allocations are based on historical catch [15] . Most large-scale fishing effort within the waters of developing coastal states is by distant-water fleets [16] , which may not share an interest in conserving local ecosystems and can negatively impact local communities that lack capacity to access these fish or enforce their boundaries. Over half of high seas fishing grounds would not be profitable without subsidies [17] and reducing capacity-enhancing subsidies could bolster food security and employment in coastal fisheries and level the playing field within seafood markets and trade [3, 18] .",

Decoupling subsidies from fishing (e.g., cash transfers) can be very useful but requires careful design and implementation. Buybacks to reduce fishing capacity tend to fail due to seepage back into harmful practices or capture by unintended actors [21] .",

The specific mechanisms of new fisheries support programs will depend on local contexts, but it is essential that subsidies aim to support fishers, not just fishing per se. Receiving cheaper fuel or better gear requires fishers to fish more, when they could instead choose to use financial support towards livelihood improvements such as households, nutrition, education, etc., that enhance well-being in the long-run. Such programs can be more cost-effective than common harmful subsidies such as fuel, which can increase fisher income by less than 10 cents for every dollar spent [23] .",

For example, conditional cash transfer programs could be used in the short-term to incentivize participants (e.g., vessel owners, license holders, and fish workers) to undertake actions aligned with broader societal goals. This can include payments for monitoring or restoration initiatives that help enhance coastal resilience or rebuild fish stocks (SDG 13.1 and 14.2). At longer time scales, subsidies could support desired transitions across seafood-related industries (e.g., improved management systems, reduction of post-harvest loss, value-added processing) or into new activities [21] . Countries subsidizing distant-water fleets could shift to supporting fisheries management in other nations to enable their participation in markets, with the same outcome of sourcing seafood while increasing incomes of local fishers, provided exports do not reduce local accessibility of seafood and associated micronutrients for coastal populations [9, 24] . Such 'onshoring' of foreign fishing could also reduce transshipping and contribute to enhanced monitoring, transparency, and management.",

An effective agreement to end harmful fisheries subsidies is an added opportunity to address important challenges in supporting fishing economies. For example, downstream fish workers have historically not received subsidies directly but must be included in sectoral reforms. Governance of high seas fisheries is also a controversial issue including large differences in monitoring and management effectiveness across species and regions [25, 26] , which have led to calls to close the high seas to fishing [27] . Subsidies that result in overcapacity can undermine the conservation mandate of Regional Fisheries Management Organizations (RFMOs) within their convention areas. Thus, while subsidies may be seen as a domestic issue for nations, they are not a trivial contributor to non-cooperation, and improved efforts towards transparency and accountability must be extended towards subsidies as well.",
