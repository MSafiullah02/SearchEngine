However, the role of both agents remains incompletely characterized, and diagnoses of these infections are still a challenge. Regarding C. perfringens type A, the high prevalence of enterotoxin-encoding gene cpe in diarrheic dogs led to a suspicion that this additional virulence factor was responsible for the pathogenesis of canine C. perfringens-associated diarrhea. However, several studies have failed to confirm this hypothesis [11]. Recently, three pore-forming toxins (NetE, NetF and NetG) that are always present in C. perfringens type A cpe\n+ strains were described in association with fatal canine hemorrhagic gastroenteritis [2]. Until now, the study by Gohari was the only study in the literature on this topic. Thus, the predisposing factors and occurrence of this disease remain unclear.",

Specifically for C. difficile, antibiotic therapy is well known as the most common predisposing factor for CDI. However, in the present report, neither dog received any antibiotics before being sampled [16]. described five cases of C. perfringens type C and C. difficile co-infection in foals. Similar to the two cases described here, none of the affected foals were on antibiotic therapy. In light of this, the authors suggested that the C. perfringens infection may have acted as a predisposing factor for C. difficile or vice versa. Anyway, Together, these two reports reinforce the need to study a possible synergism of C. perfringens and C. difficile in enteric disorders.",
