As an envisioned world problem, interview participants needed to foresee a condition (use of UVDR) that they have not experienced. A design prototype can help make a novel concept easier to envision. A brief description and illustration of what a small UVDR unit might look like (such as Fig. 2) is such a prototype. The figure can be used to elicit responses, grounded in the participants\u2019 own experiences, as to how the unit and procedures need to be designed.",

Although all facilities had a buffer supply, all acknowledged that supply was limited and unlikely to be sufficient for any more than a few days of peak demand. Trust in UVDR was a frequently cited barrier to implementation (Findings 10, 11). Although there is a wealth of data in the peer-reviewed literature on UVDR and the ability of FFRs to withstand UVDR, these data must be made easily available for HCWs. Government agencies (e.g., CDC, NIOSH, U.S. FDA) would need to provide their approval for UVDR to be implemented (Finding 10). This is not a trivial process, especially in the preparedness/planning stage. However, for UVDR to be an option, the government must take steps to support the approach. As part of these steps, considerations for availability of UVDR devices during a pandemic must be defined. Hospital administrators expressed concerns about purchasing and stocking UVDR devices that have a single purpose (Finding 17). One potential solution would be to make the UVDR device versatile enough to be used for other applications. Two of the hospital systems were already using UV for disinfection, so it is possible to envision a multiuse UV device that can also be used for UVDR. One of the hospitals considered other options, such as having a third party decontaminate FFRs or relying on municipal or state health authorities maintain a UVDR unit stockpile in case of need.",

The hospitals in this study indicated that UVDR implementation would take 4 to 8 weeks. This need for lead time (Finding 7) likely transcends any new technologies or practices that would be developed to deal with a pandemic. Training and implementation must also be addressed (Finding 13), which could also improve HCW appreciation for, and understanding of, the behaviors and procedures that would be essential in a pandemic. Procedures that deviate from clinical practice and traditional training need to be adequately explained and justified (Finding 9). Emergency preparedness must consider logistics, such as where units would be installed, and how they would be calibrated and maintained (Finding 16, 17). Employees need to be trained on the new approach ahead of any emergency (Finding 9, 12). It is impractical to think this training can take place at the outset of a pandemic. There are many ways to handle this ahead of time. For example, training could be included as part of annual fit testing, although this would require resources that are not freely available in health care systems.",

In light of this, UVDR protocols that rely on sharing respirators are unlikely to be accepted and batch processing would not likely be well received. This tends to favor the use of multiple smaller UVDR units so that individuals could decontaminate their own FFRs, rather than collect and decontaminate FFRs at a central location. Frontline HCWs strongly favor having decontamination available near point of care (Finding 4), which complements individual FFR decontamination. This conflicts with the legal participants\u2019 preference (Finding 19) for a small staff of well-trained individuals to decontaminate FFRs. It may be possible to resolve this conflict through well-designed UVDR equipment that is intuitive to operate (Finding 15). Factors that affect the decision about where to locate UVDR units will need to be considered, including distance to get to a unit without risking cross-contamination while the clinician transports their used mask, time in relation to distance to travel, and space for the UVDR units and storage of FFRs that are waiting decontamination (Finding 12, 16).",

They also know that their ability to mount a response relies on collaboration with outside organizations (e.g., federal, state, local government) and HCWs at their facility (Finding 8, 18). More than one site expressed doubts about clinician compliance with UVDR procedures because of causes that range from time pressure caring for those who are critically ill to lack of motivation to be personally accountable (Finding 2, 3).

These needs range from training and education, to logistics that would influence UVDR decisions, to relationships among various organizations that will be essential to protect HCWs during a pandemic. New FFR designs should be developed that reflect HCW concerns regarding decontamination, soiling, and durability. Future research can be performed to gain more information from HCWs about practical implementation needs as well as from authoritative sources on UV effectiveness in decontaminating FFRs against multiple pathogens. Learning more from HCWs can provide a basis to move forward with how the UVDR would be conceived, designed, built, tested, fielded, refurbished, upgraded, redesigned, retired, and replaced. Learning how federal, state, and municipal health organizations anticipate and plan for a pandemic would inform understanding of the potential for UVDR.",
