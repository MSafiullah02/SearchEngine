The Jingmenvirus (JMV) group holds a special place among flaviviruses and flavi-like viruses because they have a segmented ssRNA(+) genome. We detected Alongshan virus (ALSV), which is a representative of the JMV group, in ten pools of adult Ixodes persulcatus ticks collected in two geographically-separated Russian regions. Three of the ten strains were isolated in the tick cell line IRE/CTVM19. One of the strains persisted in the IRE/CTVM19 cells without cytopathic effect for three years. Most ALSV virions purified from tick cells were spherical with a diameter of approximately 40.5 nm. In addition, we found smaller particles of approximately 13.1 nm in diameter. We obtained full genome sequences of all four segments of two of the isolated ALSV strains, and partial sequences of one segment from the third strain. Phylogenetic analysis on genome segment 2 of the JMV group clustered our novel strains with other ALSV strains. We found evidence for the existence of a novel upstream open reading frame in the glycoprotein-coding segment of ALSV and other members of the JMV group.",

Additionally, in contrast to the \"classic\" flaviviruses that have one long open reading frame (ORF) and virion size of 40-60 nm, these viruses have several ORFs within single segments and virion sizes varying from 30-35 nm to 70-100 nm [2, 4, 5] .

Segment 1 contained a flavivirus-NS5-like protein with polymerase and putative methyltransferase domains and a predicted signal peptide on the N-terminus of the protein. Segment 3 contained a flavivirus NS3-like protein with proposed functions of serine protease and RNA helicase ( Figure 5 ). Both proteins had transmembrane regions corresponding to the previously-mapped strain H3. Segment 4 contained two non-flavivirus-related ORFs. There was a slippery sequence (G GTT TTT) and some evidence of an RNA-structured region ( Figure S6 ) and we believe that the VP3 ORF may be expressed via -1 ribosome frameshifting ( Figure 5) , as was previously shown for other ALSV strains. Regarding the VP1a and VP1b ORFs in segment 2, transmembrane regions and N-glycosylation sites were also in positions in the predicted amino acid sequences similar to the other ALSV strains [5] . Interestingly, we were not able to identify signal peptides in either VP2 or VP1a using the TMHMM v.2.0 software. We performed a search of the functional elements in the VP1a region with the Synplot2 program [27] . Using codon alignment of four previously-described ALSV strains (MH158416, MN107154, MN107158, MN095520) and the three strains sequenced in this study, we discovered two regions of high conservation in the VP1a ORF ( Figure 6A ). The first one corresponded to the 3 -terminal region of the ORF. We believe that such a high level of conservation in this region was caused by an overlap with the VP1b ORF. We managed to find a slippery motif (A AAA AAC) followed by a spacer and an RNA structure ( Figure S7 ) in this region of the VP1a ORF that theoretically would allow VP1b to be translated via -1 ribosome frameshift ( Figure 5) .",

Sequences MN095532 and KX377514 were found to have unknown nucleotides in the middle of the segment and were not used in the analysis. For these sequences, nuORF was confirmed to be intact. We then constructed a phylogenetic tree ( Figure S1 ) that allowed us to identify three groups (Jingmen tick, Yanggou and Alongshan viruses) that should be analysed separately due to phylogenetic distance. All JMTV sequences with full segment 2 (25 entries) known to date (March 12, 2020) have a nuORF. We performed analysis of the JMTV segment 2 sequences ( Figure 6B ) and Synplot2 showed high conservation in the first~100-codon region. This demonstrates that the region associated with nuORF is conserved more highly than would be expected under neutral evolution in both ALSV and JMTV sequences.",

We isolated three tick-derived strains of ALSV using the tick cell line IRE/CTVM19; our results, together with those of the previous studies reporting successful in vitro isolation and continuous propagation of JMV group viruses [5, 9, 18] , suggest the possibility that mammal-derived viruses will more readily infect mammalian cells, while tick-derived viruses may be more infective for tick cells. However, additional isolations of JMV group viruses will be required to test this theory and the possible underlying genetic causes. For the first time we showed that the ALSV strain Miass527 can persist in tick cells for at least three years. It was previously shown that the tick cell line IRE/CTVM19 may harbor an unknown rhabdovirus [31] . Our experiment confirmed the presence of a rhabdovirus and suggests that it does not interfere with the persistence and active reproduction of ALSV in IRE/CTVM19 cells. Persistent infection in tick cells and ticks could affect virus properties, as was previously shown for tick-borne encephalitis virus [34] .",

ALSV virions were reported to be enveloped spherical (or nearly spherical) particles with a diameter of approximately 80-100 nm [5] . The size of virions of our strain Miass527 was 40.5 \u00b1 3.7 nm. In transmission electron microscopy, some of the viral particles had electron-dense cores, and could hypothetically be defective virions without genomic RNA [35] . In addition, we found smaller particles with a diameter of 13.1 \u00b1 2.1 nm, which had either electron-translucent or electron-dense cores. Presumably, they could represent either: (a) glycoprotein aggregates, similar to the \"classic\" flavivirus nonstructural protein 1, which is secreted from infected cells [36, 37] , (b) protein structures appearing after long-term virus persistence, (c) virions with incomplete genome, or (d) virions of an unknown virus or other unknown structures present in IRE/CTVM19 cells. In the equivalent gradient fraction of uninfected cells, we found only particles with a diameter of 15.7 \u00b1 1.8 nm, i.e., slightly larger than the small particles that we saw in the same fraction of Miass527-infected cells. In any case, the particles were smaller than the smallest parvovirus virions with a diameter of 18-26 nm [38] . Further investigations are needed to clarify the nature of these particles.",

The nuORF, proposed here, is conserved in all the full segment 2 sequences of ALSV, JMTV and Yanggou virus available at the time of writing. Considering that ALSV and JMTV are somewhat distantly related (around 70% nucleotide identity and around 80% amino acid identity in the NS5-like protein), it is likely that the nuORF indeed encodes a functional virus protein. Nevertheless, further studies are needed to confirm its expression and function during the virus life cycle.",

Such proteins are present in a variety of RNA viruses and perform different functions. For example, in flaviviruses, small membrane proteins NS2B and NS4A (with sizes similar to the nuORF) perform multiple functions, ranging from enzyme cofactors [39, 40] to participation in particle formation [41, 42] and protection against the cellular antiviral response. Influenza A M2 protein acts as a proton-selective ion channel [43] , whereas Coronavirus E protein acts as a viroporin and plays a role in induction of the regulation of the unfolded protein response [44] .
