However, this simple rationale for seed tolerance to LN exposure has been questioned by the demonstration that intracellular ice formation in seed tissues during cooling to LN temperature is not always a lethal event. In pea seeds, the unfreezable water content, as determined from DSC heating thermograms, was found to be lower than the critical water content for freezing injury, i.e. 0.26 and 0.33 g H 2 O g \u2212 1 dry weight, respectively (Vertucci 1989a).

With C. arabica seeds, which exhibit a very high sensitivity to rapid cooling to LN temperature (Becwar et al. 1983 , Dussert et al. 1997 , Eira et al. 1999a ), a slow precooling step (1\u00b0C min \u2212 1 to \u2212 50\u00b0C) prior to immersion in LN had a beneficial effect on seed survival (Dussert et al. 1997 (Dussert et al. , 1998 . Furthermore, it has been shown that sensitivity of whole C. arabica seeds to LN exposure was due to damage caused to the endosperm only, since all embryos extracted from frozen seeds after thawing developed into normal seedlings when cultured in vitro (Dussert et al. 1997 (Dussert et al. , 2000 . In the present study, experiments involving two cooling regimes down to LN temperature were carried out with whole seeds of 9 coffee species showing differences in desiccation sensitivity. To study whether intracellular ice formation was associated with freezing injury, the unfreezable water content of endosperm of seeds of these 9 coffee species was determined by DSC analysis. Moreover, endosperm lipid content and composition were studied to determine their influence on sensitivity of seeds to LN exposure.",

At water contents higher than 0.22 g H 2 O g \u2212 1 dry weight, a second endotherm (peak 2) appeared with an onset temperature of \u2212 20\u00b0C. With continuing seed rehydration, the size and the onset temperature of peak 2 increased and, at the highest water contents experimented, the peak 1 appeared only as a small shoulder at the end of peak 2 (Fig. 4) . DSC analysis of C. arabica lipid extract revealed the presence of one main endotherm whose characteristics were identical to those of peak 1 of seed sample thermograms.

Thus, peaks 1 and 2 were attributed to the melting transition of lipids and water, respectively. Even if the characteristics of the peak corresponding to the melting of lipids varied between the different coffee species studied, the unfreezable water content could be determined using the same method. Because the two events partly overlapped at high water contents, the sum of the areas of the two peaks was used for regression against seed sample water content as performed by Vertucci (1989a) in oily seeds.",

            "text": "With the five coffee species for which seedling recovery was achieved after seed LN exposure, the HMFL value coincided with that of the unfreezable water content, indicating that seeds of those species were not able to withstand intracellular ice formation during the freezing/thawing process. Seed cryopreservation studies involving determination of the unfreezable water content from DSC analysis are scarce. However, from these few studies, it can be established that some seed materials can withstand the presence of some freezable water during exposure to sub-freezing temperatures, while others can not. It was first demonstrated with pea seeds that formation of intracellular ice crystals did not always limit survival (Vertucci 1989a) . Vertucci (1989a) suggested that, below a threshold water content (about 0.33 g H 2 O g \u2212 1 dry weight in pea seeds while the unfreezable water content was of 0.26 g H 2 O g \u2212 1 dry weight), the ice crystals that form in pea cotyledons and embryos during cooling are too small to cause significant damage and do not coalesce during rewarming. By contrast, whole soybean seeds did not withstand intracellular ice formation during LN exposure (Vertucci 1989a) . Since the shift in tolerance of soybean seeds to the presence of some freezable water in their tissues was observed in the range of temperatures where phase transitions of storage lipids occurred (between \u2212 30 and \u221250\u00b0C), it was suggested by Vertucci (1989a) that the interaction between storage lipids and water somehow promoted formation of ice crystals large enough to cause lethal damage. Seed lipid contents of the different coffee species studied here were of the same order of soybean seeds (about 20% dry weight). Thus, the present results are consistent with the earlier study of Vertucci (1989a) with orthodox Fig. 7 .

Results of one-way ANOVAs: soybean seeds, and confirm that intracellular ice formation seems to be lethal in lipid-rich seeds, independent of their level of desiccation sensitivity. Furthermore, these data indicate that the unfreezable water content does correspond to the upper limit of the hydration window allowing the successful cryopreservation of such seeds. In addition, the susceptibility of seeds to the presence of some freezable water during LN exposure does not seem to be related to desiccation sensitivity per se because some of the seed materials that were shown to tolerate it, such as Landolphia kirkii (Vertucci et al. 1991) and Zizania (Vertucci et al. 1995) embryos, were also shown to be considerably less tolerant to desiccation than coffee seeds. At least two possibilities, which may not be mutually exclusive, can be proposed to explain the low survival after LN exposure observed in C. arabica, C. canephora and C. eugenioides at water contents where no more freezable water is present in seed tissues and where no desiccation damage was detected: (1) some of the cooling, thawing, and postthawing conditions were sub-optimal; (2) desiccation sensitivity as quantified at room temperature in terms of water content was not the real lower limit of the hydration window for LN exposure. These two proposals have to be explored, taking in account the strong association found between the level of unsaturation of fatty acids and the sensitivity to LN exposure in seeds of the coffee species studied here.",

            "text": "The second proposal, i.e. that the critical water content for desiccation sensitivity measured at room temperature does not correspond to the lower limit of the hydration window for LN exposure, is derived from observations and suggestions of Eira et al. (1999a) . These authors observed an increase in the critical water content for desiccation sensitivity of Coffea spp. seeds with decreasing temperature from +15 to \u221220\u00b0C. A theoretical basis for this phenomenon has been proposed by Vertucci et al. (1994) . This assumes that a single critical water activity determines the desiccation sensitivity of seeds of a given species. Since, at given water content, seed water activity decreases with decreasing temperature (Vertucci and Roos 1993 , Vertucci et al. 1994 , 1995 , it is possible that the water activity of seeds cooled to \u2212196\u00b0C is decreased to a value lower than the critical water activity for desiccation sensitivity. Consequently, even if at room temperature the water activity of seeds desiccated to WC u is higher than the critical water activity for desiccation sensitivity, when frozen these seeds undergo desiccation damage. The relationship between the water activity, a w , and the temperature, T (in Kelvin), is described by the following equation derived from the van't Hoff isochore (Vertucci and Roos 1993 , Vertucci et al. 1995 , Eira et al. 1999b ): d(ln(a w ))/ d(1/T) =DH sorp(T) /R, where DH sorp(T) is the enthalpy of sorption and R is the ideal gas constant. Assuming a constant DH sorp with temperature (Vertucci and Roos 1993) , in C. arabica seeds at 0.2 g H 2 O g \u2212 1 dry weight (the unfreezable water content), DH sorp should not be lower than \u22120.5 kJ mol \u2212 1 of water in order to avoid a decrease of seed water activity at \u2212 196\u00b0C below the critical water activity for desiccation tolerance, i.e., about 0.45, as quantified at room temperature (Dussert et al. 1999) . The value of DH sorp measured between 5 and 25\u00b0C at 0.2 g H 2 O g \u2212 1 dry weight in C. arabica seeds by Eira et al. (1999b) was lower than \u2212 0.5 kJ mol \u2212 1 of water, indicating clearly that desiccation damage could occur at LN temperature in C. arabica seeds if assuming the existence of a single water activity for desiccation sensitivity and a constant value of DH sorp with temperature. Therefore, the prediction of the existence of an hydration window for LN exposure in non-orthodox oily seeds should not be done by the comparison of the unfreezable water content with the critical water content for desiccation sensitivity as measured at room temperature, but by comparing the critical water activity for desiccation damage, measured at room temperature, to the calculated water activity at LN temperature of seeds desiccated to the unfreezable water content.",

To our knowledge, this is the first study that investigates the nature of this relationship. Additional data, previously reported by other authors, fit remarkably well with the relationship shown on Fig. 7 : the unfreezable water contents of seeds of Quercus rubra, Q. robur and Azadirachta indica were of 0.32, 0.21 and 0.14 g H 2 O g \u2212 1 dry weight, respectively, whereas their lipid contents are 3, 20 and 43% dry weight, respectively (Pritchard and Manger 1998 , Sun 1999 , Sacand\u00e9 et al. 2000 . The relationship between the lipid content and WC u appeared not to follow a linear model, even when WC u was expressed on a non-lipid dry weight basis. Since this relationship was not linear, it is a good indication that either the interaction between non-lipid components and water varies among species or that lipids interfere with the freezing properties of water. The interspecific variability observed in coffee seeds for the water activity corresponding to the unfreezable water content ranged between 0.75 and 0.88 (water potentials of between \u2212 38 and \u2212 19 MPa), and was found to be independent of the seed lipid content. These values of a wu are remarkably consistent with those observed in orthodox seeds of pea and soybean (Vertucci 1990 ). However, the interspecific variance for the water activity corresponding to unfreezable water content is certainly associated with the non-linear relationship observed between the lipid content and the unfreezable water content of seeds: in other words, components other than lipids influence the value of a wu .",
