[3] [4] [5] Recovery from pneumonia takes longer in the elderly, and associated complications and mortality are more frequent than in younger adults. 4, 6 Pneumonia is one of the most common causes of hospitalization and decreased activities of daily living (ADL) among the elderly. 7, 8 Recent data indicate that both the incidence of pneumonia and its associated mortality are rising in this group. 9 The cost associated with hospitalization due to community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) including NH residents was reported in 2002 to be $4.4 billion 2 ; these costs were significantly greater for those admitted from an NH. Infection is a major reason behind the transfer of NH residents to acute-care hospitals and pneumonia is the leading cause of infection requiring hospitalization. [10] [11] [12] Pneumonia-related hospitalization rates for NH residents are nearly 30 times higher than those for independently living elderly. 13 Nine to 51% of patients acquiring pneumonia in NHs are reportedly transferred to hospital. [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] Death rates from pneumonia in NH residents may reach as high as 57%. 4 Kaplan et al. 19 reported that among elderly persons admitted to hospital, the incidence of death from pneumonia up to 1 year after hospitalization is twice that among the elderly admitted due to other causes. The difference in death rates between pneumonia and other causes could not be attributed to differences in underlying diseases. The cost of treatment in the NH for pneumonia is $480/case, while the cost in the hospital exceeds $7000/case. 20 Given that there are currently 1.6 million NH residents in the USA and the average incidence of pneumonia among them is 0.45 per person per year, this translates into millions of dollars each year in costs associated with pneumonia therapy.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 121, "end": 122, "text": "2", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 308, "end": 311, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 312, "end": 315, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 316, "end": 319, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 458, "end": 460, "text": "4,", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 461, "end": 462, "text": "6", "ref_id": "BIBREF5"}, {"start": 591, "end": 593, "text": "7,", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 594, "end": 595, "text": "8", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 709, "end": 710, "text": "9", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 1094, "end": 1098, "text": "[10]", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 1099, "end": 1103, "text": "[11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 1104, "end": 1108, "text": "[12]", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 1238, "end": 1240, "text": "13", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 1332, "end": 1336, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 1337, "end": 1341, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1342, "end": 1346, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1347, "end": 1351, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 1352, "end": 1356, "text": "[18]", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1426, "end": 1427, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}, {"start": 1442, "end": 1444, "text": "19", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 1877, "end": 1879, "text": "20", "ref_id": "BIBREF19"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "PNEUMONIA IN THE ELDERLY: PREVALENCE, MORBIDITY, AND MORTALITY"}, {"text": "A wide range of different bacterial and viral pathogens are responsible for CAP in the elderly as well as NH-acquired pneumonia (NHP) in the United States. Foremost among them is Streptococcus pneumoniae, which accounts for up to half of all cases. 19 Other commonly encountered bacterial pathogens include Staphylococcus aureus, Haemophilus influenzae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, Legionella pneumophila, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, and gram-negative rods, such as Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli. 5, 13 During recent years, the role of viral pathogens in the etiology of acute lower respiratory tract infections (ALRIs) in the institutionalized and non-institutionalized elderly has been described with increasing frequency. 21 While influenza is well recognized as a cause of viral pneumonia in the aged, several studies in recent years have demonstrated the importance of parainfluenza virus (PIV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus, and human metapneumovirus (hMPV). 22 ", "cite_spans": [{"start": 249, "end": 251, "text": "19", "ref_id": "BIBREF18"}, {"start": 522, "end": 524, "text": "5,", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 525, "end": 527, "text": "13", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 750, "end": 752, "text": "21", "ref_id": "BIBREF20"}, {"start": 1007, "end": 1009, "text": "22", "ref_id": "BIBREF21"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "ETIOLOGY OF PNEUMONIA"}, {"text": "Many factors such as the presence of certain comorbid medical conditions (e.g., chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), use of certain drugs, changes in physiochemical characteristics of the non-specific host defense system (such as cilia and mucus of the respiratory tract), malnutrition, and mechanical devices contribute to an increased incidence of pneumonia in the elderly. However, an important predisposing factor to the increased incidence of infections is the well-described age-associated decline in immune responsiveness. Changes in immune response not only decrease resistance to pathogens, they also contribute to increased morbidity and mortality due to infections. Adequate functioning of the immune system becomes critical in determining the outcome of infections among elderly persons already compromised by the presence of disease and other physiological changes. Considerable evidence indicates that aging is associated with impaired regulation of the immune system. [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] This decline in immune function contributes to the increased incidence of infectious, inflammatory, and neoplastic diseases observed in elderly subjects, as well as their prolonged post-illness recovery periods. Prospective studies indicate a higher incidence of morbidity and mortality in elderly subjects with low delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) responses, an in vivo measure of cellmediated immune response. [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] Different cells of the immune system contribute to the impaired immunity associated with old age, but T cells have been shown to be the major contributor. [38] [39] [40] In vivo, T cell-dependent functions, such as DTH, 35, 41 resistance to viral and bacterial challenge, 39 and response to T cell-dependent vaccines, 31, 42 have been shown to be depressed with age. In vitro, the proliferative responses of lymphocytes to phytohemagglutinin (PHA), concanavalin A (Con A), and anti-CD3 (T cell receptor) have been shown to be depressed with age. 40, [43] [44] [45] [46] Antigen-and mitogen-stimulated interleukin-2 (IL-2) accumulation declines with age and contributes to the T cell-mediated defects observed with aging. 45, [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] The observed alterations in T cell function have been attributed to intrinsic changes in the T cells themselves and include the following: shifts in the distribution of functionally distinct T cell subsets, 54 increases in the accumulation of memory T cells and decreases in na\u00efve T cells, 55, 56 diminished ability of na\u00efve cells to produce IL-2 and progress through cell cycle division, 53 changes in the efficiency of early signal transduction events, 30,45,57-60 and the ability of T cells to produce and respond to IL-2 (T cell growth factor) and to express the IL-2 receptor, 45, [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] 61 as well as increases in prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) production. 41, [62] [63] [64] Reports on the age-associated changes in the production of other cytokines are less consistent. For example, decreases, increases, or no change in the production of IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a), IL-1, and interferon-g (IFN-g) have been noted. [65] [66] [67] [68] [69] [70] [71] [72] [73] Looney et al. 74 showed that peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from elderly subjects produced significantly less IFN-g compared to young subjects when stimulated with autologous dendritic cells (DC) infected with RSV, suggesting that aging may be associated with a defect in the T cell response to RSV. Humoral response to RSV tested in different adult age groups have shown that older and frail elderly adults have a lower neutralizing antibody titer than young adults and that neutralizing antibody titer declines with age. [75] [76] [77] These findings suggest potential mechanisms for the increased morbidity observed with RSV infection in the elderly.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 986, "end": 990, "text": "[28]", "ref_id":

DNA synthesis, and cell proliferation, and thus is needed for all highly proliferating cells, especially the immune cells. 83 Zinc has been shown to play an important role in the regulation of the immune response, particularly T cellmediated function. 82, 84, 85 Similar to changes observed in the immune response of the elderly, zinc deficiency is associated with thymus involution and reductions in lymphocyte proliferation, DTH, and antibody response to vaccines. 86 Zinc deficiency is also associated with reductions in the ratio of na\u00efve to memory CD4 T cells and Th1/Th2 ratios, as indicated by lower IL-2 and IFN-g production. 86, 87 Reports on the effect of zinc on other cells of the innate immune system are less consistent. Decreases, 88, 89 increases, or no changes in Mf and PMN functions have been reported due to changes in zinc status. 83, [90] [91] [92] [93] Like the elderly, zinc-deficient subjects have greater susceptibility to a variety of pathogens. 94 Several investigators have reported low zinc status or decreased zinc intake in elderly subjects. [95] [96] [97] Furthermore, low zinc status in the elderly contributes to ageassociated dysregulation of the immune response 98,99 and zinc supplementation has been shown to improve T cell function in the elderly. 95, [99] [100] [101] [102] Thus, zinc deficiency is indicated as a risk factor for immune deficiency and susceptibility to infection in the elderly. 99, 103, 104 Zinc supplementation may therefore play an important role in the prevention of infectious diseases in this group. 95, 98, 101, 104 Various studies on zinc supplementation in the elderly have observed increased circulating zinc concentrations 100,101 as well as enhanced immune status, including improved cell-mediated immune response, IL-2 production, and increased response to DTH. 99, 102, 105 In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial (n = 81), institutionalized elderly (>65 years) had a significant decrease in the mean number of respiratory infections during a 2-year period of supplementation with micronutrients containing 20 mg of zinc and 100 mg of selenium (as zinc sulfate and selenium sulfide, respectively), but not vitamins. 106 In another, larger (n = 725), randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled intervention study, low-dose zinc and selenium supplementation (20 mg as zinc sulfate and 100 mg as selenium sulfide) significantly increased the humoral response in institutionalized elderly subjects (aged 65-103 years) after vaccination. 107 The number of subjects without respiratory infections during the study period was also found to be higher in the group that received trace elements over a 2-year period. 107 While these studies suggest zinc may have a protective effect against respiratory tract infections, contributions from other nutrients in the administered mixture cannot be ruled out. A recent study by Prasad et al. 108 showed that supplementation with 45 mg/day of elemental zinc in the gluconate form for 12 months in a small number (24-25/group) of elderly (aged 55-87 years) subjects significantly reduced the incidence of all infections, including respiratory infections. The effect on pneumonia could not be evaluated due to the low incidence of infections. The authors concluded that while these results are encouraging, they need to be repeated with a larger number of participants.
