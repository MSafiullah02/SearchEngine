It can develop in the presence of severe septicemia and shock, particularly after pseudomonas septicemia in the neutropenic patient. In our experience a septic child may complain of lower limb pain; however, as the child is so systematically unwell this can be overlooked. On examination the foot is plantar flexed with tight lower leg muscle compartments. There may be reduced skin sensation over the foot or parasthesia. The pathognomonic sign is extreme pain on the slightest attempt to actively or passively move the foot. Loss of pedal pulses is a late finding. The differential diagnosis is deep vein thrombosis, lower limb cellulitis, or an ischemic arterial problem. The diagnosis is a clinical one; checking compartment pressures and Doppler ultrasound studies can be misleading [80].",

All four compartments should be opened right down over the ankle using a medial and lateral incision. The sooner this is done the better the chances of saving the muscles. Though muscle compartments expand markedly after release, use of a loose subdermal tacking suture allows apposition of the wound edge without increasing the compartment pressures. This reduces the need for skin grafting and thus gives a much better cosmetic result. Hemostasis with bipolar diathermy must be done scrupulously as bleeding is a major problem postoperatively. Numerous debridements of dead muscle may be required, although this should be left until demarcation has occurred. Delayed primary closure, tissue flaps, or skin graft may be used subsequently.",

The two major advantages of the ultrasound guided approach are that venous occlusion is much reduced approximately 2\u20133 % versus upto 25 % for open lines [5] and that redo surgery is significantly more straightforward. See Chap. 10.1007/978-3-662-48590-3_27 [64]. Like all procedures the operator will improve with experience and there are significant benefits to be gained from concentrating expertise [120].",

If obstruction or fistula makes operative intervention necessary then great care must be taken to handle the bowel gently and avoid resection wherever possible. A high incidence of anastomotic leaks follows bowel resection of irradiated bowel due to a compromised blood supply and poor wound healing. Extensive dissection of adhesions should be avoided and a side-to-side bypass operation considered in some cases. When a resection is inevitable, for instance after perforation or in response to chronic severe blood loss, then more generous resections should be made and the bowel temporarily exteriorized to avoid an anastomosis [38, 118].",

Investigation of diarrhea includes sending stool culture for anaerobic organisms, C. difficile toxin, and microscopy and culture looking for protozoa, fungi, or viral infestation. Viral infection is of particular importance in the bone marrow transplant patients as clinically it is difficult to differentiate infection from acute graft-versus-host disease. The consequences of increasing the level of immunosuppression to treat graft-versus-host disease, when the patient is actually suffering from viral colitis, can result in a fatality. Sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy are useful in making the diagnosis by providing biopsies from affected areas of colon for histology [55, 121, 127].

Changes in the normal bacterial flora of the colon as a result of antibiotic therapy (especially clindamycin and in infants ampicillin) allows overgrowth of C. difficile with subsequent release of toxins that cause mucosal damage and inflammation [53]. Clinical presentation includes mild to moderate diarrhea, antibiotic-associated colitis with or without pseudomembrane formation, and fulminant colitis (Figs. 31.6 and 31.7). Associated symptoms include abdominal cramps and bloody diarrhea. In instances of fulminating colitis the patient presents with an acute abdomen, fever, tachycardia, and lethargy. Toxic dilatation may develop. Diagnosis depends on demonstration of C. difficile toxins in the stool; sigmoidoscopy or proctoscopy and biopsies may be beneficial as most disease is confined to the rectum or sigmoid. However, in 10 % of cases the colitis is limited to the proximal colon. Unfortunately, colonoscopy in these latter cases, in patients with fulminant colitis, may be complicated by perforation.\n\n",

Granulocyte colony stimulating factor may hasten the return of an immunological response though its role is yet to be proven. Constipation should be treated with stool softeners and laxatives.

            "text": "Endoscopic examination can be very useful. The endoscopic appearance of graft-versus-host disease shows edema, erythema, and frank ulceration but these signs are nonspecific [37]. Mucosal biopsy, however, may be characteristic [102] and can help differentiate graft-versus-host disease from opportunistic infections and other causes of colitis [7, 67]. Upper gastrointestinal biopsies have a higher yield than biopsies from the colon or rectum. However, as the disease is patchy the most affected area of bowel should be examined. Invasive procedures such as endoscopy or biopsy should be undertaken because the benefits are often life saving and the actual risks of serious complication are relatively low [7, 52, 102].",

We recently reviewed liver and lung biopsies taken from bone marrow transplant patients at the Bristol Royal Hospital for Sick Children with undiagnosed findings such as worsening liver function and increasing respiratory distress. Of eight liver biopsies (seven by Tru-cut and one by open operation) three were related to graft-versus-host disease, two were due to viral infection, two were related to transfusion siderosis, and one was an aspergilloma. Two open lung biopsies showed one case of cytomegalovirus pneumonitis and one case of radiation fibrosis. Overall we found the complication rate to be low and a number of unsuspected diagnoses were made that altered future management [42].",

The prognosis of graft-versus-host disease is worse if skin, gut, and liver are all involved. The only indication for surgical intervention is perforation of the intestine. Severe hemorrhage is best treated by aggressive medical management with correction of clotting abnormalities, platelet transfusion, and endoscopy. The results of surgical resection in the acute phase are universally poor.
