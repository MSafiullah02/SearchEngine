The GAG heparin prevents infection by a range of viruses when added exogenously, including the S-associated coronavirus strain HSR1 and more recently we have demonstrated that heparin can block cellular invasion by SARS-CoV-2. Heparin has found widespread clinical use as anticoagulant drug and this molecule is routinely used as a proxy for the GAG, heparan sulphate (HS), a structural analogue located on the cell surface, which is a known receptor for viral invasion. Previous work has demonstrated that unfractionated heparin and low molecular weight heparins binds to the Spike (S1) protein receptor binding domain, inducing distinct conformational change and we have further explored the structural features of heparin with regard to these interactions. In this article, previous research is expanded to now include a broader range of GAG family members, including heparan sulphate. This research demonstrates that GAGs, other than those of heparin (or its derivatives), can also interact with the SARS-CoV-2 Spike S1 receptor binding domain and induce distinct conformational changes within this region. These findings pave the way for future research into next-generation, tailor-made, GAG-based antiviral agents, against SARS-CoV-2 and other members of the Coronaviridae.",

Protein expression was carried out in MagicMedia\u2122 E. coli Expression Media (Invitrogen, UK) at 30\u00b0C for 24 hrs, 250 rpm. The bacterial pellet was suspended in 5 mL lysis buffer (BugBuster Protein Extraction Reagent, Merck Millipore, UK; containing DNAse) and incubated at room temperature for 30 mins. Protein was purified from inclusion bodies using IMAC chromatography under denaturing conditions. On-column protein refolding was performed by applying a gradient with decreasing concentrations of the denaturing agent (6 -0 M Urea). After extensive washing, protein was eluted using 20 mM NaH2PO4, pH 8.0, 300 mM NaCl, 500 mM imidazole. Fractions were pooled and buffer-exchanged to phosphate-buffered saline (PBS; 140 mM NaCl, 5 mM NaH2PO4, 5 mM Na2HPO4, pH 7.4; Lonza, UK) using a Sephadex G-25 column (GE Healthcare, UK). Recombinant protein was stored at -20\u00b0C until required.",

All spectra obtained were the mean of five independent scans, following instrument calibration with camphorsulfonic acid. SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD was buffer-exchanged (prior to spectral analysis) using a 5 kDa Vivaspin centrifugal filter (Sartorius, Germany) at 12,000 g, thrice and CD spectra were collected using 21 \u03bcl of a 0.6 mg.ml -1 solution in PBS, pH 7.4. Spectra of glycosaminoglycans were collected in the same buffer at approximately comparable concentrations, since these are disperse materials. Collected data were analysed with Spectral Manager II software prior to processing with GraphPad Prism 7, using second order polynomial smoothing through 21 neighbours. Secondary structural prediction was calculated using the BeStSel analysis server 11 .To ensure that the CD spectral change of SARS-CoV-2 S1 RBD in the presence of GAGs did not arise from simply from the addition of the GAG spectra (this class of carbohydrates are known to possess CD spectrum at high concentrations 12,13 ), difference spectra were analysed for each GAG in order to verify that the change in the CD spectrum arose from a conformational change following binding to the test GAG.",

(A) Circular dichroism spectra (190 -260 nm) of nCovS1RBD alone (black solid line), heparin (red solid line) and heparan sulphate (blue) in PBS, pH 7.4. The dotted vertical line indicates 193 nm. (B) Details of the same spectra expanded between 200 and 240 nm. Vertical dotted lines indicate 222 nm and 208 nm. (C) Secondary structure content analysed using BeStSel for nCovS1RBD. \u03b1 helical secondary structure is characterized by a positive band at ~193 nm and two negative bands at ~208 and ~222 nm (analysis using BeStSel was performed on smoothed data between 190 and 260 nm.
