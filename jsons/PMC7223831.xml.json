The time spent on the weaning process is estimated to represent 40\u201350% of the total duration of mechanical ventilation on the ICU [6, 8, 10, 18]. Accordingly, three different weaning categories were defined at an International Consensus Conference in 2005 and published in 2007: \u2018simple\u2019, \u2018difficult\u2019 and \u2018prolonged\u2019 [3].

According to the International Consensus Conference, SBT failure criteria are defined both by subjective indices (e.g. depressed mental status, diaphoresis, cyanosis) and objective measurements (e.g. low PaO2 values, high PaCO2 values, low pH values or a high rapid shallow breathing index [RSBI]) [3]. Here, the first 30 min are crucial to the success of the SBT [7, 30]. The reintubation rate is reportedly at only 13% in patients who pass the SBT [4, 11, 28], regardless of whether it lasts 30 or 120 min [9, 24]. However, recent data showed that there might be patients who succeed in the 30 min trial but fail the 120 min trial [20].",

This is particularly important for patients with underlying severe chronic respiratory failure who are undergoing prolonged weaning, especially because the weaning process in this patient group takes up a significant proportion of the total mechanical ventilation time; if weaning eventually fails, it then becomes necessary to continue invasive mechanical ventilation in the home environment (home mechanical ventilation, HMV) via a tracheostoma [5, 14, 27]. The current trial therefore focused on these particular subjects and specifically tested whether the SBT is applicable to subjects who have undergone prolonged weaning.",

On one hand, none of the subjects who had a successful SBT were eventually able to be weaned from invasive mechanical ventilation. On the other, many of the subjects who fulfilled specific failure criteria for the SBT were still able to continue spontaneous breathing for many hours, even in cases of severe physiological disturbances. For example, even subjects with an extremely high RSBI during the first 30 min of spontaneous breathing were able to maintain spontaneous breathing for many hours. Finally, there was discordance between the subjective comfort during spontaneous breathing vs. the physiological parameters assessed during the SBT.

In contrast to patients with easy or difficult weaning, patients undergoing prolonged weaning mostly suffer from chronic respiratory failure, and many also have significant comorbidities that affect respiratory mechanics [9].

In addition, patients are likely to have adapted to a more \u2018rapid shallow breathing\u2019 pattern during the course of their disease and may therefore tolerate higher RSBIs for a longer period of time.

            "text": "However, it has not been clarified how long the RSBI can remain above 105 breaths/min/l before the SBT has to be terminated. Interestingly, in this trial, high individual variations in RSBIs were documented amongst patients with prolonged weaning, which further supports the thesis that patients in prolonged weaning differ from intubated patients in the ICU. In particular, the individual variations in RSBIs observed amongst patients with prolonged weaning (see current data) would present a challenge when deciding whether to terminate the SBT based on these criteria. In the present trial, an elevated RSBI was the first failure criterion to be met within the first 30 min in 8 out of 15 subjects. However, the SBT had to be terminated within the first 30 min in just half of these subjects. Therefore, the RSBI does not seem to be an adequate proxy for SBT failure in prolonged-weaning patients. Furthermore, it was also shown that the duration of spontaneous breathing recommended upon clinical appraisal did not correlate at all with the duration of spontaneous breathing that occurred until the first failure criterion was fulfilled. It did, however, correlate with the duration of spontaneous breathing during the current experimental set-up, where maximal correlation was observed between the clinically recommended duration of spontaneous breathing and the actual time subjects spent on spontaneous breathing at home. It can hence be postulated from these data that clinical assessment is more useful in this case than following the rigid failure criteria for the SBT.",

            "text": "Even though the International Consensus Conference data published over 10 years ago described the SBT as a well-accepted predictor of successful weaning [3], a very recent epidemiological study covering 2729 subjects concluded that many of the subjects treated on the ICU cannot be categorized according to the results of the SBT, because this particular trial is not always performed in clinical practice [2]. A different categorization scheme for the degree of weaning failure severity was therefore proposed, which is independent from performing an SBT [2]. Indeed, the SBT is a technically complex procedure in patients with prolonged weaning, as demonstrated in the current study. Given the fact that the SBT is yet to be convincingly adapted for use in the specific cohort of prolonged weaning, in contrast to intubated patients receiving short-term invasive mechanical ventilation, the current study doubts that the SBT\u2014as recommended by guidelines\u2014is a worthwhile tool for predicting spontaneous breathing capabilities in prolonged, unsuccessful weaning. Clearly, further studies adding to the current pilot testing are necessary to validate this observation.",
