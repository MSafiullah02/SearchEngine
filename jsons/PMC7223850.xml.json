Buser et al.21 identified how the primary mechanism of myelination failure in the preterm infant involves dysmaturation, a disrupted cellular response whereby pre-oligodendrocytes fail to differentiate in diffuse astrogliotic lesions (i.e., pre-oligodendrocyte maturation arrest). Dysmaturation of neuronal structures was then identified in experimental and clinical imaging studies.5,22\u201327 Brain dysmaturation, including that measured in the white matter and in the gray matter, is the most important predictor of the high burden of neurodevelopmental impairments in preterm infants. Potentially modifiable neonatal predictors of brain dysmaturation and neurodevelopmental disabilities in this population include sepsis, retinopathy of prematurity, and chronic lung disease.2,3",

Pain is one such \u201ceveryday\u201d clinical exposure. Increasing evidence suggests that pain is a central factor that predicts dysmaturation, especially in babies born very preterm and in those with many early exposures to pain. Preterm infants often spend months in the NICU, where they receive many painful procedures that are essential to life-saving care. Preterm infants exposed to more procedural pain demonstrated reduced white matter and corticospinal tract fractional anisotropy (FA) as well as lower N-acetyl-aspartate/choline in subcortical gray matter, even when comprehensively accounting for neonatal illness severity and exposure to sedatives and analgesics.28,29 Importantly, the changes in white matter FA relate to changes in diffusivity aligned along the long axis of neurons in contrast to the changes in FA related to infection and mechanical ventilation, which are perpendicular to the axonal component of diffusion. These findings further bolster the independent association of procedural pain with brain dysmaturation. The observations related to procedural pain are also congruent with studies of neonatal stress. Greater neonatal stress predicts decreased frontal and parietal brain width and altered diffusion and functional connectivity in the temporal lobes.30 More recent observations demonstrate that greater procedural pain, especially in early life, is associated with smaller thalamic volumes, specifically in the somatosensory thalamus, and poor functional outcomes to 3 years of age (Fig. 1).25",

Inter-rater reliability was very high (intraclass coefficients >0.96) with notably lowest internal consistency for stressful procedures.41 The highest consistency was obtained on the NFCS-R. It did appear that standard physiological measures were not as consistently expressed as measures of pain in comparison to behavioral measures. It also appeared that behavioral measures of body tenseness and movement were more often reliably affected by pain than facial grimacing. The authors concluded that this study confirmed that psychometrically sound assessment tools exist for evaluation of newborn pain and that focus should shift to training, clinical utility, and an understanding of the appropriate management related to the scores.",

Another review article recently summarized non-invasive monitoring of stress biomarkers in the newborn period and found that the most commonly used marker remained as cortisol in saliva (reflecting acute stress) or hair (reflecting chronic stress).49 Further research is urgently needed to determine the optimal measures of acute and chronic pain and stress in infancy.",

Nonpharmacologic strategies with potential benefit prior to minor painful procedures include non-nutritive sucking, breast milk, music therapy, skin-to-skin contact, kangaroo care, and facilitated tucking.16 These interventions consistently reduce behavioral responses to minor acute painful procedures, such as needle sticks. Uniquely, facilitated tucking improves both pain reactivity (immediately after the painful stimulus) and immediate regulation (at least 30 s after the painful stimulus) in preterm infants.50 Unfortunately, despite over 70 randomized controlled trials including over 7000 infants and young children, low-quality evidence pervades this field of study, potentially contributing to underutilization of these interventions in clinical practice.51 Trials generally include small samples, with few examining identical combinations of painful procedure, intervention, and assessment technique. These limitations prohibit any conclusions regarding the optimal nonpharmacologic bundle of care for preterm infants. The confluence of low-quality evidence for existing interventions and the ethical principles governing randomized controlled trials involving painful procedures creates a challenging environment for researchers.52 Leveraging unique trial designs, such as non-inferiority trials, and broadening assessed outcomes to include both subjective and objective measurements of infant response hold the promise of expanding knowledge in this area of study without causing unnecessary pain and stress to fragile patients.",

The true mechanism of action of oral sucrose clearly impacts the potential for adverse neurologic impact. Data regarding chronic opioid receptor stimulation clearly suggest the potential for negative neurologic impact.65 Dopamine, acetylcholine, and serotonin play central roles in development of motor function and attention, which is noteworthy considering the context of the available data regarding the developmental impact of sucrose. Repeated exposure to sucrose in the first week of life (ten times daily) prior to handling or needle prick as compared to placebo results in long-term alterations in white and gray matter volumes in mice.66 Mice that received sucrose prior to handling had poorer short-term memory in adulthood compared to controls, while the combination of sucrose and needle prick did not protect against impairment in short-term memory associated with repetitive pain.17 In human preterm infants, sucrose (0.1 mL of 24% solution) for all invasive procedures in the first week of life had no impact on measures of motor development or attention/orientation at term-equivalent follow-up in a single randomized controlled trial.67 However, increased sucrose exposure (greater than ten doses per day) was associated with poorer motor development and attention/orientation scores, an association not observed in the placebo group, suggesting this finding was not attributable to increased painful procedures.67,68 Additionally, a retrospective study found no protective effect from glucose prior to painful procedures on brain growth, functional connectivity, and neurodevelopmental impairments at 18 months of age.23 In this setting, randomized controlled trials of sucrose in preterm infants continue to be required, specifically examining short-term objective markers of efficacy and long-term neurodevelopmental effects.",

Dexmedetomidine is a highly selective \u03b12-adrenergic receptor agonist that provides analgesia, anxiolysis, and sedation via reduction in sympathetic outflow from the locus coeruleus and release of substance P from the dorsal horn of the spinal cord. Clinical data in preterm infants are limited, but suggest the potential for short-term benefits compared to opioids, given the lack of respiratory depression and lack of impact on gastrointestinal motility.90,91 In contrast to benzodiazepines and opioids, preclinical data examining \u03b12-agonists suggests neuroprotection of the immature brain.92 Extensive clinical research is required to define optimal dosing of dexmedetomidine in preterm infants and to clarify the safety and efficacy profile of this agent.",

Pain should be avoided and, when encountered, treated with a stepwise algorith, including standardized nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic interventions.A systematic scoring system should be utilized prior to, during, and following acute painful procedures for all infants requiring neonatal intensive care in addition to regular scoring at care times. Standardized training for scoring and guidelines on the management of the score with regard to interventions for comfort should be developed by each NICU.Nonpharmacologic interventions, such as facilitated tucking, should be consistently utilized prior to mild to moderately painful procedures.If sucrose is utilized to mitigate behavioral responses to minor painful procedures, clinicians should administer the lowest effective dose less than ten times every 24 h in conjunction with nonpharmacologic interventions.Anesthesia should be provided to prevent intraoperative pain and stress responses from major surgery. Rapidly acting opioid agents with a relatively short duration of action (fentanyl or remifentanil) should be provided prior to moderate painful procedures, including intubations.Stress should be minimized during invasive mechanical ventilation by providing appropriate containment of the infant and an optimal sensory environment, including appropriate levels of light, noise, and maximal parent presence. Currently, no pharmacologic therapy has demonstrated safety and effectiveness for preterm infants requiring prolonged, invasive mechanical ventilation. Low-dose morphine (\u226410 \u03bcg/kg/h and/or 50 \u03bcg/kg/dose as needed at least 5 min prior to agitating stimuli) may be utilized selectively on the basis of clinical judgment. Morphine may be titrated cautiously on the basis of pain scale scores and/or physiologic indicators of discomfort, carefully considering both short- and long-term risk:benefit ratio. In the setting of insufficient sedation from morphine, dexmedetomidine infusion may be considered, titrated carefully to effect while monitoring closely for adverse reactions.\n",

            "text": "Quantifying the impact of pain on brain development is complex. Given that severity of illness can be associated with increased need for painful interventions, it can be difficult to resolve the contribution of pain itself from the comorbid conditions resulting in painful stimuli. The subjective nature of most clinical pain assessment tools introduce a source of variability into comparative studies aimed to address pain in the newborn. Additionally, the known direct and indirect adverse pharmacological effects of sedative and analgesic medications on neuronal injury must be weighed against the clear adverse effects of untreated pain and agitation on the developing brain. Future research directions must address these three critical areas using a combination of preclinical models and pragmatic clinical studies. Development of objective measures of pain will need to interrogate physiological signals/responses to pain. Such tools would enable comparative studies of nonpharmacologic therapies and sucrose, which must also evaluate the long-term neurodevelopmental effects of these interventions. Rigorous clinical studies utilizing short- and long-term objective makers of safety and efficacy are also vital to address optimal dose, timing, and cumulative exposure to pharmacological agents. Anesthesia/analgesia is clearly indicated and clearly improves outcomes in the setting of major acute painful stimuli, although uncertainty about the optimal approach remains a source of variability in clinical practice and requires further investigation. The approach to preterm infants requiring long-term sedation/analgesia for mechanical ventilation is equally unclear, with major adverse effects inextricably linked to high-level exposure to both benzodiazepines and opioids. The potential promising role of dexmedetomidine in this population warrants careful investigation.",
