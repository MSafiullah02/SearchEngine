Besides, the recovery rate is also less than 30%. 1 To reduce its death and the length of stay (LOS) in hospitalization resulting from COVID-19, the administration of anti-viral therapy may provide a solution to treat these emerging infected cases. [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] The recent one-arm beforeand-after study on the compassionate use of remdesivir for patients with COVID-19 has shown 68% clinical improvement. 7 Two recent two-arm randomized controlled trials have been conducted to assess its efficacy. 8, 9 One has shown promising but nonsignificant results on clinical improvement due to insufficient power 8 whereas the other has shown significant results of the recovery but non-significant results on death from COVID-19 were revealed in the interim report. 9 We previously demonstrated the efficacy of reducing the risk of death and high-risk state and enhancing the chance of discharge as a result of remedesivir. 10 Such inconsistent results may be also attributed to the failure to consider risk-stratified efficacy of remedesivir, allowing for the severity of COVID-19, namely, precision treatment for COVID-19. To tackle this issue, the best way is to conduct a stratified randomized controlled trial or adaptive design after interim report to allow for the severity of COVID-19 patients. In order to be timely to reduce the sequelae of COVID-19 pandemic during global emergent crisis, the alternative is to elucidate dynamic of COVID-19 with the exhibition of transition from low-risk state to high-risk state defined by clinical events (e.g. invasive mechanical ventilation and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO)) and final to death after the stratification of different .

Table 1 also shows the transition of the 53 subjects across three risk states and the final destination of discharge during the onemonth study period. The data used for deriving the rate of COVID-19 evolution in the light of two disease transition models for subjects receiving standard care are summarized in Table 1 . Following the rationales mentioned above, the observed data with regression of risk states were not included for the estimation under the scenario of COVID-19 patients receiving standard care. Table 3 shows the estimated results on the daily transition rates for the two continuous-time five-state Markov models. The two daily regression rates were estimated as 0.048 (95% credible interval (CI): 0.027-0.066) from high-risk to medium-risk state and as 0.155 (95% CI: 0.098-0.227) from medium-risk to low-risk state during hospitalization. The higher overall discharge rate regardless of risk states in the treated group as opposed to the control group is mainly explained by the mechanism of two regression rates during hospitalization, resulting in a double proportion of discharge in the low-risk state in the treated group as opposed to the control group (0.149 (95% CI: 0.081-0.206) vs 0.070 (95% CI: 0.030-0.111)).

The slow recovery may increase the possibility of transmission and infectious period so as to spur the next outbreak after contact with the susceptible. To reduce these two burdens, one of solutions is to have the better use of potential promising anti-viral therapy like remdesivir, which has been proposed for compassionated use in total of 53 patients and demonstrated 68% clinical improvement. 7 Although it is a one-arm study, a simulated two-arm controlled study was therefore conducted to further prove the efficacy of remdesivir in reducing death by 29% (95% CI: 22-35%) and high-risk state of COVID-19 patients by 45% (95% CI: 42-48%). 10 It is also very effective in halving the median time of length of stay in hospitalization. 10 As the efficacy of remdesivir may vary with the severity of COVID-19 at enrollment how to provide risk-stratified efficacy evidence plays an important role in precision medicine for the optimal treatment of COVID-19. To achieve this goal, we may need another stratified randomized controlled trail or an adaptive randomized controlled trial. While waiting for these well-designed trials, the alternative is to elucidate dynamics of COVID-19 from low-risk state to final death or recovery based on a simulated twoarm controlled trial, which becomes the main contribution of this study.",
