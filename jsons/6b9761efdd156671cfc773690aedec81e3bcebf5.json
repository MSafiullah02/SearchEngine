At the moment of the beginning of the pandemic, 60 patients were treated with anti-CD20 (54 with rituximab and 6 with ocrelizumab). The mean age was 47.21\u00b19.86 years-old in the whole group, 47.09\u00b19.56 in patients with rituximab, and 48.33\u00b112.16 in patients with ocrelizumab. 32 patients were classified as having relapsing-remitting MS (53.3%), 14 (23.3%) as secondary-progressive, 9 (15.0%) as primary-progressive forms and 5 as optic neuromyelitis (8.3%). COVID-19 infection was reported in 9 (15%) in the whole sample, 7 (12,9%) in patients receiving rituximab, and 2 (33,3%) in patients with ocrelizumab. Main clinical characteristics of COVID-19 are depicted in Table 1 . Interestingly, all patients with COVID-19 did not show serious complications, despite that a patient required admission to a hospital.",

Our study suggests that anti-CD20 does not seem to have an important role in the risk of infection by SARS-CoV2. In this regard, it was more associated with the infection of other relatives living at home (Chan et al. 2020) . These findings support the view that the presence of B cells is not absolutely required for recovery from COVID-19 (Quinti et al. 2020; Soresina et al. 2020) . It is worth mentioning that all cases were relatively mild and only one required hospital admission but without complications. This is consistent with the preliminary observations in MS from Italy (Sormani et al. 2020). However, this apparently lower severity of the infection should be studied specifically. In addition, a substantial proportion of patients lived with a relative suffering the infection, but they did not develop symptoms. Overall, these findings seem to support the hypothesis outlined by Prof. Giovannoni in his editorial. ",
