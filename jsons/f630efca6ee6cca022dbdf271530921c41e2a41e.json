So far prospective randomized therapeutic trials are awaited for the treatment of Mollaret's meningitis using intravenous acyclovir or the more modern oral forms of virostatics (famciclovir, valaciclovir). For decades the causative agent of facial palsy (Bell's palsy) has been sought; only with the advent of PCR has this question been answered. Although one single study indicates the superiority of a combination of acyclovir plus prednisone, this finding has to be confirmed by a large scale prospective randomised double blind study.

The virus travels by retrograde axonal transport to the neuronal cell body and establishes a latent infection that usually persists for the life of the host. Trigeminal sensory ganglia are well-known sites of HSV I latency [52, 64] . However, viral DNA has been found within other parts of the CNS in 34 % of those dying of non neurological diseases, suggesting that the brain itself may sometimes be a site of HSV I latency [6] . Recurrent cutaneous herpetic diseases (in HSV I mostly herpes labials, also herpetic keratitis) result when HSV I is reactivated from latency to a replicative stage. Many different events are known to Human T-cell lymphotropic viruses I and II promote HSV I reactivation; none, however, has been epidemiologically clearly linked to the development of herpes simplex encephalitis. In most cases rami meningeales of the trigeminal ganglia or trigeminal nerve respectively lead the way of reactivated HSV I, causing temporo-polar, temporo-basal and/or frontobasal invasion of the brain [26, 52, 64] . In primary infection or re-infection with HSV I, causing HSV I encephalitis, the olfactory route is usually the route of invasion, leading to an initially frontobasally accentuated encephalitis.",

The dramatic urgency of this is underlined by the fact that the only predictor of outcome in HSV I encephalitis which can be influenced is the level of consciousness at the time of initiation of therapy [52, 64] . The first diagnostic examination is MRI (without and with i. v. contrast enhancement) mainly evaluating the temporobasal and frontobasal regions [29] . If MRI is not available CT must be done immediately. After determining the safety of lumbar puncture by imaging, CSF examination is the immediate next diagnostic step. The CSF cell count, protein, glucose and a negative Gram stain provide rapid confirmation of an inflammatory process suggesting vi- ral encephalitis [42] . Cultures for bacterial, fungal, mycobacterial and viral pathogens should be arranged, although viral culture is positive in less than 5 % of patients with HSV I encephalitis. The identification of HSV I DNA in the CSF of patients with HSV I encephalitis by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is the diagnostic standard technique, with a sensitivity of 98 % and a specificity of at least 94 %. Results of the PCR can be available within 6 to 8 hours. PCR has become the standard for diagnosing HSV I encephalitis [6, 27, 51, 68] . Brain biopsy has been replaced by the PCR, the former carrying a risk of 2-3 % of serious morbidity [52, 64] . Table 4 shows the most important differential diagnoses both treatable and non treatable, infectious and non infectious, diseases which can be mistaken for herpes encephalitis [65] .",

Toxicity is usually mild and not treatment-limiting; it includes thrombocytopenia, increased transaminases, creatinine, and BUN. In the rare case of acyclovir side effects or acyclovir resistance vidarabine (15 mg/kg bw/day) or foscarnet (230 mg/kg bw/day) can be given as antiviral alternatives [52, 64] . Supportive measures in the management of a patient with suspected HSV I encephalitis are extremely important, including early intubation for airway protection, mechanical ventilation and, if necessary, mild hyperventilation to a pCO2 of 30-35mm Hg. If necessary osmodiuresis with 20 % mannitol (0,25 g/kg i. v.) can be instituted. The administration of phenytoin is, even in the presence of seizures, in most cases not necessary, since patients undergoing intensive care therapy are treated with the appropriate, equally anticonvulsive sedation with benzodiazepines (e. g. midazolam or lorazepam). If intracranial pressure (ICP) continues to rise, evident either clinically (anisocoria, decortication-or decerebration pattern etc.) or by neuroimaging, ICP monitoring is mandatory; occasionally decompressive craniectomy can be life saving.",

CSF cultures yield the virus in up to 40 % [45] ; the CSF shows a pleocytosis and a high protein content. EEG, CT or MRI are useful adjunctive diagnostic techniques in the presence of CSF abnormalities. HSV II-DNA detection in CSF and serum is highly sensitive for the diagnosis of neonatal HSV infections but does not replace virus isolation and antigen detection in other locations [33] . Mortality rate is 50 %; up to 50 % of the surviving children have some degree of psychomotor retardation, often associated with microcephaly, hydrocephaly, porencephalic cysts, spasticity, blindness, learning disabilities etc. [26, 52] .",

The clinical criteria [52] are: -recurrent attacks of fever, associated with signs and symptoms of meningeal irritation -the attacks last usually days and may be accompanied by generalized myalgia and are separated by symptom-free intervals lasting for weeks or months, -during the attacks a CSF pleocytosis of a mixed type, including endothelial cells, leucocytes and lymphocytes is found. Endothelial cells (Mollaret cells) are rather typical but not pathognomonic, -the disease remits spontaneously without residual signs, -approximately 5 % of the patients will have transitory neurological symptoms and signs in addition to meningeal irritation -there may be an increased gamma globulin fraction in the CSF. Until recently an integral part of the clinical criteria was that no causative micro-organism could be found. Recently, a highly likely link with herpes simplex virus has been established. HSV II (in few instances also HSV I) DNA has been detected in the CSF using PCR in patients with Mollaret's meningitis. Even HSV II DNA has been seen in the \"classic\"endothelial (Mollaret) cells [3, 21, 25, 59, 70] . CSF from patients between episodes or from control patients without a recurrent meningitis syndrome did not have the viral DNA. The association of Mollaret's meningitis with HSV II has potential therapeutic importance, since acyclovir therapy might prevent further recurrence. Further studies of this are needed.",

Transcranial magnetic stimulation allows the study of the intracranial part of the facial nerve and has proved useful in differentiating a \"classical Bell's palsy\" from a mononeuritis cranialis as part of other diseases. The radiographic imaging includes MRI with and without gadolinium or cerebral CT (with and without i. v. contrast medium) of the brain stem, cerebello-pontine angle, temporal bone and skull base; both have not proved to be of prognostic value. A full blood count including differential count should help to detect infectious mononucleosis, a blood glucose estimation, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, perhaps also antinuclear antibody test, rheumatoid factor test, Lyme serology, HIV titre and serum angiotensin converting enzyme (for sarcoidosis) may be indicated in certain patients with Bell's palsy. If by transcranial magnetic stimulation an intracranial affection is suspected, every such patient with an isolated facial palsy must undergo lumbar puncture in order to look for an acute inflammatory demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy, oligosymptomatic polyneuritis cranialis, meningitis, meningeal carcinomatosis and lymphoma, postinfectious or autoimmune disease [24, 36] .",

The combination of acyclovir (500 mg four times daily) and prednisone has been shown in a single, small, double blinded, controlled study to be superior to prednisone alone. Metaanalysis of four randomised controlled studies suggest only a marginal benefit of steroids alone concerning eventual complete recovery. Patients who had undergone a combination therapy of acyclovir with prednisone showed a more rapid improvement in facial strength and less nerve degeneration. However, another study using similar outcome measures found that single dose prednisone was more useful than acyclovir alone. Thus, although early use of prednisone seems to be indicated, and the combination of acyclovir plus prednisone may prove superior to prednisone or acyclovir alone, at this time further combination studies are warranted and urgently awaited [1, 48, 50, 52] .",
