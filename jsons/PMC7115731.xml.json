Recent prospective pneumonia etiology studies have failed to detect a pathogen in greater than 50% of adults and approximately 20% of children hospitalized with pneumonia.3, 4, 5, 6, 7 In these same studies, viruses were more commonly detected than bacteria in both adults and children, accounting for greater than 25% of detections in adults and greater than 70% in children.3, 7 The exact implications of viral detections among patients with pneumonia depend on the pathogen detected, but there is increasing evidence of their importance in pneumonia.8\n",

These rates were slightly lower than the 2009 national Kids\u2019 Inpatient Database, which reported 22.4 hospitalized pneumonia cases per 10,000 children less than 18 years old.9 There are methodologic differences that likely explain these differences, including nonoverlapping years of analysis, distinctions between the populations studied, and varying case definitions, including exclusion of the severely immunocompromised in the EPIC study. Nonetheless, there were similar trends indicating that pneumonia burden is highest among the youngest children.",

Prevalence of viruses can vary by geography and other factors, such as immunization coverage, as well as study design, including case definitions, specimen collection methods, and diagnostic tools applied; however, in most of these studies, certain viruses predominate, including RSV but also HMPV, AdV, and PIV. In a study of severe and very severe pneumonia conducted in Kenya and using multiplex PCR, a virus was detected in 56% of children less than 12 years old; RSV was most common and detected in 34% of children.15 In a different study conducted in Mozambique, viruses were detected in 49% of children with severe pneumonia, and in this case, HRV (41%), AdV (21%), and RSV (11%) were the most common.16 In similar studies, HMPV, AdV, PIV, and CoV combined account for 25% to 40% of pathogens detected in children when using PCR methods.17, 18 In many studies, codetections (viral and bacterial) in children with pneumonia have been demonstrated in more than one-quarter of cases.7, 14, 19\n",

Because most of these specimens do not come not directly from the lung, it is difficult to discern the association of a pathogen detection with pneumonia. Thus, many studies have enrolled asymptomatic controls along with pneumonia cases to help determine the possible contribution of respiratory viruses (attributable risk) to pneumonia at a population level. However, studies show variable prevalence of viruses among controls, possibly due to differences in definitions and methods for ascertainment of controls.32 Different strategies for control enrollment may be applicable to different study objectives and settings.32\n",

In this analysis, the AF indicated that the detection of influenza, RSV, and HMPV among all patients, both children and adults, indicated an etiologic role. However, the detections of PIV, CoV, and AdV, particularly in children, did not demonstrate high AF for pneumonia. HRV was associated with pneumonia in adults but not children.8 The exact role of HRV in pneumonia remains unclear and controversial, even when detected as a single pathogen, particularly because HRV can shed for greater than 2 weeks after a primary infection, making its detection at time of pneumonia challenging to interpret with respect to the current clinical illness.22, 23, 24\n",
