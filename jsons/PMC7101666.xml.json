The most common antecedent event for AMAN is Campylobacter jejuni infection due to molecular mimicry between peripheral nerve components and lipo-oligosaccharide coat of Campylobacter [1]. However, some other agents like cytomegalovirus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Hemophilus influenzae, and Epstein-Barr virus have been reported as triggers for this disorder as well [1\u20133]. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis in AMAN variant of GBS usually reveals increased protein content with less than 50 cells per cubic millimeter as in AIDP. AMAN can be distinguished from other forms of GBS by electrophysiological studies and to some extent by anti-ganglioside antibody assay profile with GM1, GD1a, GD1b being positive and GQ1b negative [1]. Current treatment options include intravenous immune globulin (IVIG) and plasma exchange (PE). Outcome of AMAN is similar to the AIDP variant and approximately 80% of the patients recover fully or have minor deficits that do not interfere with every day activities [4]. Mortality traditonally approximated 5%, but a recent study in the US hospitals revealed mortality of only 2.58% [5].",

She was not vaccinated with any influenza vaccine. The symptoms started 8 days prior to admission with fever, myalgia, and cough. Shortness of breath begun a day before she was referred to our hospital. At admission she was febrile, normotensive, severely hypoxemic, fully alert with Glasgow coma score of 15. Crackles were present diffusely over both lungs. Remaining physical examination was unremarkable. Mechanical ventilation was started immediately after admission. Chest radiography revealed diffuse bilateral patchy infiltrates and tracheal aspirate detected genetic material of H1N1 influenza A by polymerase chain reaction. Due to the poor oxygenation despite the high level of conventional respiratory support extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) was indicated. After 7 days of ECMO treatment patient was weaned and after another 3 weeks there was no need for mechanical respiratory support. Muscle weakness was observed 3 days afterward and evolved gradually over 3 days. At first, this weakness was mistakenly attributed to the critical illness polyneropathy. Six days after the patient was weaned from the ventilator tetraplegia with areflexia was noticed. Weakness included equally proximal and distal muscles in all limbs without sensory symptoms and cranial nerve involvement. Spinal tap was performed and yielded CSF containing 1 cell per cubic millimeter with high protein content of 4.528 g/l.",

Those features were indicative of motor axonal demage and compatible with AMAN. Semi-quantitative GanglioCombi ELISA anti-ganglioside antibody assay was positive for GM1, GD1a, and GD1b antibodies without the GQ1b antibody. However, this assay detects all anti-gangloside antibodies equally and cannot differentiate between the IgM and IgG subclasses. Furthermore, the results are listed as negative, gray zone, positive and strongly positive without the exact antibody titer. Computed tomography scan and the magnetic resonance imaging of the brain were normal. Plasma exchange commenced 1 day after the detection of tetraplegia and complete treatment consisted of seven sessions. Over the period of approximately 2 months her muscle strength gradually recovered. Upper extremities are mildly paretic as well as the proximal muscles of the lower extremities. However, the distal muscles of the lower extremities are still severely affected and she is only able to perform flexion of the feet. At this time the patient is still recovering in our hospital.",
