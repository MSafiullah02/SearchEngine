In order to minimize as much as possible the effect of quarantine measures on PrEP initiation, on PrEP continuation, and access to other sexual health care and prevention needs, we immediately amended our research procedures and care services. Salvador and S\u00e3o Paulo now provides additional telehealth as the default care provision platforms, such as digital participant recruitment and peer support and navigation via smartphone text messages and online social media (Instagram and Facebook), streamlined PrEP initiation and retention procedures. The strategies of navigation online were more intensified as adolescents are eager to have a conversation and ask questions on how to persist with their PrEP use under quarantine. Providers still offer in person visits at their discretion, and reserve care for individuals who do not have respiratory symptoms (Table 1).",

This adaptation has allowed PrEP initiation and PrEP continuation for AKP. Nevertheless, some reduction in recruitment of new participants for the study is observed. An added benefit is that project staff have been able to be retained and continue to provide services.",

The adoption of wraparound telehealth platforms has simplified and streamlined procedures for PrEP initiation, and has facilitated and enabled continuity in PrEP services during quarantine. These changes have been well-received by our participants and providers and will likely be sustained even after quarantine restrictions are lifted. These experiences offer important lessons for other middle income countries, as well as other countries scaling up PrEP.",
