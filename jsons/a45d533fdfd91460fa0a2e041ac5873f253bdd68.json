For example, Talbot and co-workers showed, using the mouse-adapted virus after passage in tissue culture cells 5-6 times, that mice infected intranasally with 10 4 to 10 5 TCID 50 developed encephalitis if inoculated at 8 days but not 21 days postnatally. 2 For these reasons, we postulated that virus directly harvested from suckling mouse brain would be more virulent than virus passaged, even minimally, in tissue culture. In preliminary experiments, we observed that virus directly harvested from suckling mouse brains is highly virulent and readily caused a lethal infection after intranasal inoculation of adult, 8-week-old mice. When we evaluated the contribution of the host adaptive immune response to HCoV-OC43-induced encephalitis, we found that encephalitis is, in part, immune-mediated.",

These latter strains of HCoV-OC43, which have been through 5-6 passages in HRT-18 cells (Dr. Pierre Talbot, personal communication), are likely less virulent than virus isolated directly from infected suckling mouse brains because coronaviruses often become attenuated after passage in vitro. 4 Our data also show that HCoV-OC43-induced encephalitis is in part mediated by the anti-viral T-cell response. During the course of our investigation we found that HCoV-OC43 infection appears restricted to neurons (data not shown). Neurons do not normally express MHC class I or II antigen and express only low levels of the machinery required for loading peptide onto MHC class I antigen. 5 Therefore, neurons generally do not serve as targets for activated T-cells. However, electrically silent or damaged neurons do express MHC class I antigen [6] [7] [8] and it is possible that infection with HCoV-OC43 makes neurons into suitable targets for CD8 T cells.",
