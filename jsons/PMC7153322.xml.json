N-glycan processing is identical in plants and mammals till the formation of vital intermediate GlcNAc2Man3GlcNAc2 (GnGn). In mammals, GnGn oligosaccharides enables diversification of N-glycosylation but in plants, the GnGn structures are arranged with 1,2-xylose and core 1,3-fucose residues (GnGnXF3). Although in mammals core fucosylation occurs in 1,6-linkage, the fucose residues in plants (Fig. 3\n) are in 1,3-linkage. Plant cells extend the GnGnXF3 by attaching 1,3-galatose and 1,4-fucose to form Lewis-a epitopes (Lea). Plants reveal formation of paucimannosidic structures due to the removal of terminal GlcNAc residues from GnGnXF3 by endogenous hexosaminidases similar to insects. As compared to human complex N-glycans, N-glycans of the plant systems lack sialic acid but contain core \u03b11,3-fucose (Fuc) and \u03b21,2-xylose (Xyl) modifications, and may contain terminal Lewis-a epitopes (\u03b21,3-galactose (Gal) and \u03b11,4-Fuc linked to terminal N-acetylglucosamine, GlcNac (Fig. 3). Human complex N-glycans are often sialylated containing different epitopes, including Lewis x, N-acetyllactosamine (LacNAc), and N,N\u2032-di-N-acetyllactosediamine (LacDiNAc).",

However, rhyEPO at higher doses can cause harmful increase in the RBC masses and reveals limited role in tissue protection. Asialoerythropoietin (asialo-rhuEPO), which is a desialylated form of rhuEPO, has been reported to lack hematopoietic activity, but retain cytoprotective activity. But chemically enzymatic desialylation of rhuEPO suffers from not being cost effective. Although plants are known to synthesize complex N-glycans, they lack enzymes to transfer sialic acid and \u03b21,4-galactose to N-glycan chains, therefore serve as a potential expression for generation of asialoerythropoietin.",

The N-glycosylation pathway is not completely known for model plant organism A. thaliana and other different plant species. Although intra-Golgi glycosyltransferases are reported in A. thaliana, their functions remain unknown [79] but is assumed to play a vital role in synthesis of O-glycosylated proteins like arabinogalactan proteins. Studies from A. thaliana and rice have indicated that N-glycans enable growth under stress. However, complete genome sequencing of different plants will enable better understanding of the N-glycan pathway in plants and their efficient modifications and research in this exciting field of biology with human applications in the generation of therapeutics compatible to the human body is increasing across the globe.",
