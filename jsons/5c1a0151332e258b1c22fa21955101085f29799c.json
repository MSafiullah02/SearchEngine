Although viruses are smaller in size and have relatively simple structure, they are not immune to complement attack. Thus, activation of the complement system can lead to neutralization of cell-free viruses, phagocytosis of C3b-coated viral particles, lysis of virus-infected cells, and generation of inflammatory and specific immune responses. However, to combat host responses and succeed as pathogens, viruses not only have developed/adopted mechanisms to control complement, but also have turned these interactions to their own advantage. Important examples include poxviruses, herpesviruses, retroviruses, paramyxoviruses and picornaviruses. In this review, we provide information on the various complement evasion strategies that viruses have developed to thwart the complement attack of the host. A special emphasis is given on the interactions between the viral proteins that are involved in molecular mimicry and the complement system.",

Recent cloning of C3-like molecules in nonvertebrate deuterostomes -for example, sea urchin (Al-Sharif et al 1997) and ascidians (Nonaka et al 1999) -and in proteosome -for example, mosquito (Levashina et al 2001) ; and identification of a lectin (Sekine et al 2001) and lectin-associated serine proteases in ascidians (Ji et al 1997) suggest that the complement system has emerged at least 700 million years ago, long before the appearance of immunoglobulins. The complement system has evolved to perform wide range of immune function with a goal to eliminate 'nocuous' substances from the body. This elimination is achieved by various methods: (i) Attach-ment of the complement component C3 to the pathogen surface leads to engulfment of the foreign pathogens. (ii) Formation of the membrane attack complex (MAC, C5b-9) on the pathogen surface results in direct lysis of the pathogen. (iii) Release of anaphylatoxic peptides as a result of complement activation produces the local inflammatory response against pathogen. (iv) The complement system prevents immune precipitation, and help solubilization and clearance of immune complexes from the circulation. (v) It helps in selection of appropriate antigens for a humoral response by tagging them with C3 (Dempsey et al 1996) . (vi) The complement system is also involved in negative selection of self-reactive B cells (Prodeus et al 1998) .",

            "text": "Since the complement system has evolved to perform all the above-mentioned functions, it must recognize a large array of molecular structures, and must adapt to new structures as they emerge. If the system has to fulfill all the above criteria, then it is likely to become relatively non-specific and perhaps might not be able to discriminate between the self and the non-self. Consistent with this premise, it has been reported that complement proteins which are involved in the activation process, though show preferences for certain structures Pangburn 1994, 1995; Kim et al 1992; Kinoshita et al 1988) , do not discriminate between the self and the non-self and have the potential to destroy any cell including the host cells . This inadvertent complement-mediated damage of the host cells by homologous complement is protected by a family of structurally and functionally related proteins termed as regulators of complement activation (RCA) (Lambris et al 1998) (figure 1). These proteins range from 45-540 kDa and are characterized by the presence of common structural motifs -the short consensus repeat (SCR) or complement control protein (CCP) modules. Each SCR is comprised of approximately 60 to 70 amino acids, and are characterized by a conserved motif that includes four disulphide-linked cysteines, prolines, tryptophan and many other hydrophobic residues which together form a bead-like structure. The proteins belonging to the RCA family include both the plasma proteins; for example, factor H and C4-binding protein (C4bp); and membrane proteins such as complement receptor 1 (CR1), decayaccelerating factor (DAF), and membrane cofactor protein (MCP). These proteins act at the level of C3 and C4 and function by dissociating the subunits of C3 and C5 convertases and/or by acting as cofactors for the factor Idependent cleavage of C3b and/or C4b (figure 2). In addition, regulation of complement is also achieved by non-RCA proteins like C1 inhibitor, carboxypeptidase N and CD59: which inhibit activated C1s and C1r, anaphylatoxins (C3a, C4a and C5a), and MAC formation, respectively .",

            "text": "Given that the complement proteins involved in the activation process do not discriminate between self and non-self, it is not unexpected that viruses are susceptible to complement attack. Viruses are obligatory intracellular parasites and depend solely on the host for their survival and propagation. Thus, when viruses invade the host they are exposed to the complement system of the host, which may result in complement-dependant viral lysis, neutralization of the viral particles by opsonization with complement proteins of the host and destruction of the viral particles by phagocytosis. Therefore, the complement system presents a constant threat to viruses for their survival within the host and for successful transmission. During the co-evolution of the viruses with their hosts over a period of several million years, they have developed mechanisms to combat the complement system of the host to be a successful pathogen. The viruses have adapted various ways to subvert the complement system; either by capturing CCPs from the RCA loci of their host, or by evolving CCPs within their genome. In addition, they take advantage of the complement system and use the host complement receptors to infect various cells (Sahu et al 1998a) .",

Activation however is not always associated with virus neutralization. As described further in this review, many viruses take advantage of complement activation to infect cells. Activation of the complement system can occur through three distinct pathways: the classical; alternative; or the more recently identified lectin (mannose-binding lectin; MBL) pathways (see figure 2 ): (i) The classical pathway activation has been demonstrated in the presence of virusspecific antibodies and cross-reacting antibodies (Beebe and Cooper 1981; Beebe et al 1983) . In addition, this pathway is also activated in the absence of antibodies due to the direct interaction of C1q with viral surface proteins. For example, p15E of oncornavirus (Bartholomew et al 1978) and gp41 (Ebenbichler et al 1991) and gp120 (Susal et al 1994) (Ezekowitz et al 1989; Saifuddin et al 2000) . Activation of the complement system in the absence of proper regulation can lead to virus neutralization. The various mechanisms which are known to inactivate viruses are: (i) neutralization by complement dependant aggregation; (ii) neutralization by opsonization with complement proteins; (iii) neutralization by direct lysis; and (iv) neutralization by phagocytosis (figure 3).",

Whether such phenomenon is of any physiological significance is under question since plasma-complement proteins, other than C1q and MBL, are monovalent in nature. In addition, other factors such as virus : antibody ratio and size of the aggregate (due to Figure 1 .

However, increasingly it is becoming clear that viral neutralization may occur in the absence of aggregation or lysis. The lack of evidence for lysis in most of the earlier reports and growing list of reports demonstrating evidence for neutralization without lysis suggest that this may be the major mechanism of viral neutralization. The opsonization-mediated viral neutralization is a direct result of coating of viral surface by complement proteins. These coats are clearly observed in electron microscopic studies (Welsh et al 1976; Nemerow and Cooper 1981) . Recent studies have clearly demonstrated that coating of viral surface with C3 in case of HIV-1 (Sullivan et al 1998) and C5 in case of herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) gC null virus (Friedman et al 2000) is essential for viral neutralization. Though there is no direct evidence, complement coating could inhibit virus attachment, entry, uncoating, DNA transport to the nucleus, or immediate early gene expression.",

In order for lysis to occur, sufficient numbers of MACs must be formed on the viral envelope.

Many viruses such as alphavirus, coronavirus, herpesvirus, orthomyxovirus, paramyxovirus and retrovirus families are susceptible to this type of complement-mediated lysis (reviewed in Cooper and Nemerow 1983).",

Thus, viruses have devised multiple mechanisms to manipulate and subvert the complement system, and evade the immune system of the host in order to survive as successful pathogens. A few viruses use subtle mechanisms, such as, stay latent in cells and emerge any time later during their lifetime. The lack of expression of any detectable viral antigen during their latent period allows them to evade from all the immune mechanisms including the complement system. However, once reactivated they need to evade the complement attack. Therefore, along with acute viruses, even latent viruses have developed active strategies to evade the host complement. These strategies include direct inactivation of complement either by encoding complement regulatory proteins or by capturing membrane regulatory proteins from the host and by the use of membrane complement receptors to gain cellular entry.",

            "text": "Two different families of viruses namely the poxviruses and herpesviruses are known to encode for proteins with complement regulatory activities ( Rosengard and Ahearn 1998; Sahu et al 1998b) . The first known and best-studied example is vaccinia virus complement control protein (VCP). This protein received scientific attention when it was discovered that an attenuated mutant of vaccinia virus (VV) does not encode for this protein (Kotwal et al 1990) . VCP is a 27 kDa secretory protein encoded by the C3L open reading frame (ORF) of the vaccinia genome. The primary structure, deduced from the ORF, consists of 263 amino acids, including a 19 amino acid signal peptide. Sequence analysis revealed that it is composed of four tandemly repeating SCRs (Kotwal et al 1990) and thus is homologous to members of the RCA family (see figure 1 ). Efforts have been made to determine the three-dimensional structures of VCP. Analysis of the NMR structures of pairs of VCP modules (SCR 2-3 and SCR 3-4) showed that, each SCR fold into a compact 6 \u03b2-strand structure and is conformationally similar to SCR 16 of factor H (Wiles et al 1997; Henderson et al 2001) . Importantly, it also revealed that the relative orientation of successive modules differed from one module pair to another. More recently, the crystal structure of the entire VCP molecule has been solved (Murthy et al 2001). The salient features of the crystal structure are: (i) SCR modules have the 6 \u03b2-strand topology; as shown previously by NMR structures. (ii) The \"tilt\" angles between the long axes of SCR at the SCR 1-2, 2-3 and 3-4 junctions are 60\u00b0, 63\u00b0 and 99\u00b0, respectively. Thus, the molecule has an extended structure from SCR 1-3 and a turn between SCR 1-3 and SCR 4. (iii) The \"hypervariable\" loop of SCR 1 (Lys14-Ala23) projects laterally from VCP close to the Nterminal tip of the molecule. (iv) A two amino acid insertion (Gln42 and Lys43) in SCR 1 forms a \u03b2-bulge near the interface with SCR 2. (v) A five amino acid insertion (Leu109-Ser114) in SCR 2 forms a loop near the interface with SCR 1.",

Analysis of our data led to following conclusions, (i) VCP is significantly less effective than CR1 in inhibiting classical as well as alternative pathways of complement and factor H in inhibiting the alternative pathway, but is 4-fold more effective than factor H in inhibiting the classical pathway; (ii) unlike factor H, it does not discriminate between activator (rabbit erythrocyte)-and nonactivator (sheep erythrocyte)-bound C3b; and (iii) unlike CR1 and factor H, it displays cofactor activity primarily for the first site, which is sufficient to inactivate C3b (Sahu et al 1998b) (see figure 4 ).",

            "text": "HSV gC-1 is a 511 amino acid protein including 25 amino acid signal sequence encoded by HSV-1 UL44 gene (Frink et al 1983) . The protein is highly glycosylated: containing nine potential sites for N-linked oligo-saccharides (N-CHO) (Frink et al 1983) and numerous O-linked oligosaccharides (O-CHO) (Johnson and Spear 1983; Dall'Olio et al 1985) . Although the detailed carbohydrate analysis has not been performed, it has been shown that eight to nine N-linked oligosaccharides of expressed gC-1 are occupied by approximately 1 kDa glycans, and the O-CHO moieties are primarily located at the N-terminal region (residues 33-123) (Rux et al 1996) . A complete disulphide linkage pattern has also been determined for gC-1. It contains eight cysteine residues that form four disulphide bonds (Rux et al 1996) . Glycoprotein C-2 on the other hand, is a 480 amino acid transmembrane-protein with seven potential sites for N-CHOs and several sites for O-CHOs (Swain et al 1985) . Like gC-1, it also contains eight cysteine residues. Since cysteine positions are highly conserved between gC-1 and gC-2 it is predicted that a similar disulphide pattern must be present in gC-2 (Rux et al 1996) .",

These C3b-binding sites are located in the central portion of the gCs. Further, studies using deletion mutants have revealed that the N-terminal region (residues 33-123) of gC-1, which is not involved in binding to C3b, is necessary to inhibit properdin and C5 binding to C3b (Kostavasil et al 1997) . Thus, it appears that this region sterically hinders the access to properdin and C5-binding sites on C3b. Since all these mechanistic studies were done in vitro it was important to evaluate the in vivo importance of these domains. Recent in vivo study on the role of complement-interacting domains of gC-1 has clearly shown that the C3-binding domain is more important than the C5/P-blocking domain and is a major contributor to complement evasion (Lubinski et al 1999) .",

In addition to the primary HIV-1 isolates, these host cell regulatory proteins were also found to be present in the HIV-1 infected cells. Importantly, the degree of protection to infected cells against host complement attack was found to be dependant on the expression levels of DAF and CD59 . Studies with phosphoinositol phospholipase C (PI-PLC), which removes the GPI-linked DAF and CD59 from the membrane, showed that removal of these proteins rendered the virus more susceptible to the complement attack . It is believed that in addition to DAF and CD59, factor H also protects HIV-1 from complement due to its interaction with the viral envelope proteins (Stoiber et al 1997) . Consistent with this notion factor H was shown to interact with gp41 and gp120 (Pinter et al 1995a,b; Stoiber et al 1995) . Further, it was also shown that removal of factor H from the sera results in lysis of free virus (Stoiber et al 1996) .",

However, it would be advantageous for the virus to encode a membrane-bound complement regulatory protein, which would inhibit the complement activation focused on the viral surface and the surface of infected cells. Thus we pro-posed that B5R, which shows sequence similarity to complement control proteins (Schwarting et al 1985; Goebel et al 1990; Engelstad et al 1992) , and is also present on the outer envelope of the virus (Takahashi-Nishimaki et al 1991; Engelstad et al 1992; Isaacs et al 1992b) , might confer resistance to extracellular enveloped virus against complement (Sahu et al 1998b) . When we examined the functional activity of expressed B5R we found that like VCP it lacked factor I cofactor activity (Sahu A, Lambris J D and Isaacs S N, unpublished observation). Later it became clear that complement resistance to extracellular enveloped virus (EEV) was not imparted by B5R, instead, human RCA proteins acquired by EEV provide resistance against complement (Vanderplasschen et al 1998).",

A series of studies based on monoclonal antibody competition, peptide mapping, and site-directed mutagenesis have determined that the CR2 binding site on gp350/220 lies within residues 1-470 of the viral glycoprotein. Specifically, a monoclonal antibody (72A1) that binds to this region has been shown to inhibit gp350/220 binding to CR2 and viral entry into host cells (Nemerow et al 1987; Tanner et al 1988) . Further, a nine amino acid peptide (residues 21-30, EDPGFFNVEI) that binds to CR2 has been identified within this region of the molecule (Nemerow et al 1987) , and deletion of residues 28 and 29 (VE) have been shown to abolish the binding of gp350/220 to CR2 (Tanner et al 1988) . Recently, kinetics of binding of gp350/220 to CR2 has been studied and compared to other physiological ligands (iC3b and C3d) of CR2 (Sarrias et al 2001) . It was observed that unlike binding of C3 fragments to CR2, binding of gp350/220 to CR2 follows a simple 1 : 1 binding model. Importantly the apparent K D value obtained for gp350/220-CR2 interaction was 45 nM compared to 6\u22c52 \u03bcM obtained for iC3b-CR2 and 4\u22c53 \u03bcM obtained for C3d-CR2 interactions (Sarrias et al 2001) . The high affinity of gp350/220 for CR2 compared to C3 fragments suggests that it would effectively compete out the C3 fragments from the receptor. This subtle strategy may help the virus to better infect the B cells.",

The MV entry is mediated by the interaction of its surface glycoprotein H with MCP (Nussbaum et al 1995; Devaux et al 1996) , which triggers F-induced fusion between the virus and the cell membrane. The region of MCP that interacts with the hemagglutinin has been mapped to the first two SCR domains (Iwata et al 1995; Manchester et al 1995) . The crystal structure of the first two SCRs of MCP (Casasnovas et al 1999) along with antibody binding data and site-directed mutagenesis studies of MCP (Buchholz et al 1997; Manchester et al 1997) indicate that H interaction extends from the top of the first SCR to the bottom of second SCR. The interaction sites are located at the top of SCR 1 and at the base of SCR 2. In addition, a highly hydrophobic loop that protrudes at the base of the first SCR contains residues important for virus binding (Casasnovas et al 1999) . It is believed that the N-glycan of the SCR 2, which was found to be important for viral binding (Maisner et al 1996) , stabilizes the conformation of virus binding region (Casasnovas et al 1999) . It is important to mention here that identification of MCP as a MV receptor led to the development of transgenic mouse models, which immensely aided in in vivo studies on MV pathogenesis (reviewed in Manchester and Rall 2001) . In addition to MV, human herpesvirus 6 is also known to utilize MCP as a cellular receptor (Santoro et al 1999) .",

These include echoviruses and coxsackieviruses (CV) (Bergelson et al 1994; Shafren et al 1995 Shafren et al , 1997a . The interesting feature among these viruses is that even the closely related viruses use different SCRs of DAF for binding. For example, SCRs 2-4 are utilized by echovirus 7 (Clarkson et al 1995; Powell et al 1997) and CV B3 (CVB3) (Bergelson et al 1995) , while SCRs 1 and 2 are sufficient for binding of CV A21 (CVA21) (Shafren et al 1997a) . Affinity determination using surface plasmon resonance indicated that unlike gp350/220-CR2 interaction (K D = 45 nM), the interaction of echoviruses with DAF is a low affinity interaction (K D = 3\u22c50 \u03bcM) (Lea et al 1998). It is increasingly getting clear that DAF by itself may not be sufficient for mediating productive infection and may require an accessory molecule. For example, in case of CVB3, it has been shown that putative CVB3 cellular receptor complex include DAF and CV-adenovirus receptor protein and both these receptors are essential for viral entry (Shafren et al 1997b) . Similarly, it has been shown that association of DAF with intercellular adhesion molecule 1 is essential for cellular entry of CVA21 (Shafren et al 1997a) . Thus, the current belief is that DAF primarily facilitates binding of the virus to the host cells and this in turn enables the virus to interact with the second receptor/molecule, which is the key step in cellular entry.",

Activation of the complement system either in the presence or in the absence of antibody results in opsonization of the HIV surface with C3b molecules, which may undergo proteolytic cleavage to form iC3b and C3dg fragments. Thus, opsonized viral particles have the ability to interact with complement receptors such as CR1, CR2 and CR3. In late 1980's, it was shown that treatment of HIV with antibody and complement results in enhanced HIV infection (Robinson et al 1988) . Currently, several groups are trying to delineate the role of complement and complement receptors in HIV infection (reviewed in Cooper 1998; Spear et al 2001; Stoiber et al 2001) . It is generally be-lieved that binding of opsonized HIV particles to complement receptors either help in enhancement of CD4-dependant entry and infection or result in effective transfer of these particles to T cells.",

Viruses come in contact with complement and are prone to complement attack during both the stages of their life cycle: (i) while they are present outside the cell, and (ii) during their intracellular phase, due to the presence of viral proteins on the surface of infected cells which are known to activate complement. Thus, for extracellular survival as well as for propagation, viruses must develop mechanism(s) to evade complement attack. Understanding these mechanisms are difficult since in vitro studies in tissue culture as well as studies performed using animal models may not reflect the true situation. Nevertheless, studies performed thus far clearly indicate that viruses have devised multiple strategies to manipulate and subvert the complement system. Some viruses encode proteins that modulate and inhibit the host's complement function, while others pickup the host complement regulatory proteins to do the same, and still others use complement receptors to gain cellular entry. Current efforts are directed at identification of the vital structural determinants of immune evasion molecules that are important in interacting with complement proteins. These studies would not only allow us to better understand the structural features of immune evasion molecules important in its biology, but would also identify a significant control point in the molecule that would direct the development of pharmacological ligands to neutralize these viruses. ping of the primary binding site of measles virus to its receptor CD46; J.
