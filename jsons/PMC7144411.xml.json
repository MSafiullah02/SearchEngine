However, although there has been considerable work throughout Canada and around the world to prepare for a pandemic, much has also changed over the intervening period regarding expectations. The complexities of preparing for a pandemic are immense. We have spent the last three years discussing pandemic planning at conferences and in the College's Health Professional Roundtable for Strategy (HRPS) sessions. Are we ready? This question is extremely timely for all health leaders as we react to the most recent scare with the severe respiratory illness outbreak, H1N1, which originated in Mexico. So let us catch up to where we are today.",

Since 1700, no more than 42 years have passed without a pandemic event. It has been 41 years since the last pandemic so the risk of another is high enough to warrant urgent readiness. Global travel patterns make the risk of a pandemic homogeneous around the world so that all countries are equally vulnerable to a pandemic that originates in one country.3\n",
