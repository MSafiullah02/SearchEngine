Bobby calves are defined as unweaned calves that are transported for slaughter at meat processing premises for human consumption or pet food, usually within the first week of life (Anonymous, 2015). In New Zealand, around 4 million dairy calves are born between July and September each year (Anonymous, 2017b). Approximately one quarter of these are kept as replacement dairy animals (Hickson et al., 2015), with the remainder sold as bobby calves or to be raised as beef cattle, or killed on farm (Wesselink, 1998; Stafford et al., 2001; Mellor, 2011). Thus, each year in New Zealand approximately 2.2 million bobby calves aged between four and approximately seven days are transported to slaughter.",

In the 2015 New Zealand dairy season, bobby calf mortality before the point of slaughter was 0.25 %, dropping to 0.12 % in 2017 (Anonymous, 2017a,b), equating to between 4800 and 5500 calves per year. While the current mortality rate is low, it may be important to further reduce this for animal welfare, economic and reputational reasons by understanding and addressing the underlying risk factors in each stage of the supply chain. Factors associated with the rearing, management, handling, transport and yarding of bobby calves at the processor before slaughter have the potential to impact on their health and welfare, which may in turn influence mortality rate.",

The second step involved checking correlations between all variables associated with the outcome at P < 0.2. Correlations between pairs of variables eligible for inclusion were determined. For the pairs of continuous variables correlation was assessed using the Pearson correlation coefficient, whereas the Kendall\u2019s correlation was used for the pairs of categorical variables. In both cases one variable in the pair was included in the model if the correlation exceeded an absolute value of 0.7. Thirdly, a multivariable model was constructed that included all variables that were associated with the outcome at P < 0.20. In the fourth step, a preliminary multivariable model was created by stepwise removal of the least significant variable (assessed using the Deviance test statistic) until all remaining variables were statistically significant at P < 0.05. When a variable was dropped from the model, changes in co-efficient and standard error were examined. The fifth step was an assessment of whether the continuous variables modelled had a linear relationship with the logit through the inclusion of a quadratic term. The quadratic term was retained in the model, or the variable converted to a categorical variable, if it significantly improved the fit as determined by the likelihood ratio test statistic. In the final step, the model was applied to the restricted data set (excluding cases that died or were condemned in the yards). For both models, the fit was assessed using the Hosmer & Lemeshow Goodness of Fit test and by examining the Pearson\u2019s residuals.",

An example of the latter might be management of bedding in the calf pens, such that pathogen load might increase as the farm\u2019s calving season progressed, increasing the risk of infection later in the season. The severity of infectious disease in calves has been shown to be influenced by management and hygiene practices (Castro-Hermida et al., 2002) as well as immune status (Meganck et al., 2014). Furthermore, disease transmission among infected calves may also be affected by management factors such as housing, group size and hygiene (Trotz-Williams et al., 2007; Lorenz et al., 2011), which may change over a farm\u2019s season. Although no significant associations were found in the multivariable model between farm variables such as frequency of bedding change or housing cleaning/disinfection and calf mortality in the present study, it should be noted that the number of case calves was relatively small (n = 38 for the full data set and n = 18 in the restricted data set). In addition, given that considerable variation was observed among farms in factors such as frequency of cleaning/disinfection of housing and frequency of bedding change, the associations between time in the farm\u2019s season and such factors may warrant further investigation.",

This contrasts with the present study, in which transport duration was significantly associated with mortality in yards as well as overall. This apparent difference may be due to the definitions applied to death/condemnation in yards. In the present study, death or condemnation in yard could occur at any point prior to presentation for slaughter, whereas the previous study defined this as \u2018dead overnight\u2019, implying death or condemnation after overnight holding only. According to the Victorian Code of Accepted Farming Practice for the Welfare of Cattle bobby calves held overnight must be fed as soon as practicable (Anonymous, 1996).

For example, young dairy calves deprived of feed for up to 30 h demonstrated progressive reductions in plasma glucose and increases in plasma beta hydroxy butyrate, indicating the development of hypoglycaemia and switch to lipid for energy metabolism (Todd et al., 2000). Additionally, although free water is provided in the yards, it is not known whether calves consume this. Therefore, it is possible that prolonged feed withdrawal may be accompanied by water loss, leading to dehydration.",

Secondly, we may not have detected a true association in the restricted data set because of a lack of statistical power as there were only 18 cases in the CIY/DIY subset. A post hoc power analysis estimated that the power to detect an association in the limited data set was relatively low (0.43). It is not possible to postulate as to which reason is more likely.

These new regulations are consistent with the findings of this study, namely that limiting travel duration and time to slaughter is associated with reduced mortality. Accordingly, the bobby calf mortality rate in New Zealand has declined since this research was undertaken, from 0.25 % in 2015 to 0.12 % in 2016, and 0.06 % in 2017 (Anonymous, 2017a, 2018a).

However, retrospective data collection meant that information on individual calf age, health and immune status or age at separation from the dam was not available. Therefore, the influence of these factors on calf mortality could not be assessed. Previous studies of dairy calf mortality on New Zealand farms have identified disease status and failure of passive transfer of immunity (FPT) as risk factors for mortality. For example, a prospective study of calf and replacement heifer mortality on 32 New Zealand dairy farms in 2015 found that risk of mortality on-farm in the first week of life was higher in herds with disease problems, such as scours, and among calves that were removed from the dam within 12 h of birth and hand-fed colostrum (Cuttance et al., 2017a). A related study investigating passive transfer of immunity and colostrum quality found that calves that remained with the dam for \u223c24 h had lower prevalence of FPT (Cuttance et al., 2017b). The authors postulated that feeding poor quality, pooled, stored colostrum (with low antibody and high bacterial concentrations) to calves less that 24 h old was responsible for the observed effects (Denholm et al., 2017). The present study collected information on colostrum feeding practices (e.g. true or mixed) and quality management (whether or not colostrum quality was checked) on-farm. Neither of these factors were found to significantly influence mortality risk in the final multivariable model. Given the relatively small sample size in the present study, along with the small number of farms that reported checking colostrum quality, further investigation of the effects of colostrum management on bobby calf mortality may be informative.",

Although travel time and slaughter schedule can be, and are now, subject to regulation, time in season is more difficult to regulate due to the wide calving spread in New Zealand\u2019s pastoral-based dairy system. However, the identification of this as a risk factor provides some insight into factors of potential importance on farm. It is possible that further education and extension within the industry could be effective in reducing animal welfare compromise and mortality associated with seasonal effects.
