            "text": "Five families of viruses are recognized as negative-stranded RNA viruses. These are the Arenaviridae, Bunyaviridae, Orthomyxoviridae, Paramyxoviridae, and Rhabdoviridae (Matthews, 1982) . All have a lipid envelope, an external fringe of glycoprotein, and internal components consisting of one or more species of single-stranded RNA in addition to structural proteins and RNA polymerase components. Positive-stranded RNA viruses include members of the Picornaviridae, Caliciviridae, Togaviridae, Flaviviridae, Coronaviridae, and the nonenveloped insect and plant virus groups. The togaviruses, flaviviruses, and coronaviruses are enveloped and in that regard structurally resemble negative-stranded viruses except that they lack virion RNA polymerase activities. The picornaviruses, caliciviruses, and the insect and plant nonenveloped, positive-stranded viruses consist of singlestranded viral RNA enclosed in structural proteins. Of the other major families of RNA viruses that have been recognized, the retroviruses are enveloped, diploid, single-stranded RNA viruses that have reverse transcriptase enzyme components within their virus particles; Reoviridae and Birnaviridae members are nonenveloped, multisegmented, double-stranded RNA viruses that have virion RNA polymerase components.",

For the picornaviruses, caliciviruses, and flaviviruses, the complete viral-size RNA is the only mRNA species; for at least some togaviruses and coronaviruses there are additional subgenomic, viral-sense RNA species (i.e., mRNA species that represent parts of the viral RNA sequence). Upon introduction into a cell, the viral RNA of positive-stranded viruses is translated by cellular ribosomes and the derived gene products initiate the processes that lead to a productive infection (i.e., replication of the RNA and 2 DAVID H. L. BISHOP synthesis of all the usual RNA, mRNA, protein, and virus forms). Due to these properties, the viral RNA of positive-stranded viruses can be infectious per se. The RNA species of negative-stranded viruses, retroviruses, and the double-stranded RNA viruses are not infectious per se since the infection processes of each of these viruses requires that the virion polymerase transcribes the viral RNA into complementary sequence mRNA species (reoviruses, birnaviruses, negative-stranded viruses), or DNA copies (retroviruses), before the infection can proceed. Therefore, removal of viral protein from the RNA of these viruses eliminates the required enzymes and renders the RNA noninfectious.",

In this chapter, the evidence will be reviewed that shows that arenaviruses and members of one genus of the Bunyaviridae (phleboviruses) have some proteins coded in subgenomic, viral-sense mRNA species and other proteins coded in subgenomic, viral-complementary mRNA sequences (i.e., the viruses have genomes with a n ambisense coding strategy). This unique feature is discussed in relation to the implications it has on the intracellular infection process and how such a coding arrangement may have evolved.",

The viruses are grouped into the Old World and New World species, although LCM virus (the prototype virus of the family) has been found in Africa, the Americas, Europe, and Asia (Pfau et al., 1974) . An alternate designation for the New World arenaviruses that is based on serological considerations is the Tacaribe complex (Table I) . Recent information indicates that at the nucleotide and protein sequence levels members of both groups are closely related (see below). For this reason, as well as the observation that LCM virus has been recovered from both Old and New World countries, the serological designation Tacaribe complex viruses will be employed in this review. In reference to the other group, the term LCM complex viruses will be employed since various investigators (Casals, 1978; Casals et al., 1975; Rowe et al., 1970a; Wulff et al., 1978) have reported that LCM and 4 DAVID H. L. BISHOP human infections (reviewed by Casals, 1975; Berge, 1975; Peters, 1984) .

A comprehensive earlier review on the structural features of arenaviruses, including information on the biophysical and antigenic properties, purification, and replication processes, has been published by Pedersen (1979) . The extensive literature on the biology of LCM and an able discussion of the subject matter can be found in the review by Lehmann-Grube (1971) . Additional information, including the results of studies with other arenaviruses, can be found in the Bulletin of the World Health Organization (Vol. 52, pp. 381-766, 1975) .",

            "text": "Electron microscopic analyses of intact arenaviruses, as well as thin sections of arenavirus preparations and infected tissues, have shown that the viruses usually contain ribosomes, and that virions are frequently spherical but often pleomorphic, with sizes ranging from 50 to 300 nm, although their average size is 110-130 nm (Abelson et al., 1969; Blechschmidt et al., 1977; Dalton et al., 1968; Gard et al., 1977; Lascano and Berria, 1969 Maiztegui et al., 1975; Mannweiler and Lehmann-Grube, 1973; Matthews, 1982; Murphy and Whitfield, 1975; Murphy et al., 1969 Murphy et al., , 1970 Ofodile et al., 1973; Speir et al., 1970; Vezza et al., 1977) . The structural proteins of arenaviruses have been reported by a variety of investigators (Buchmeier et al., 1977 (Buchmeier et al., , 1978 Gangemi et al., 1978; Gard et al., 1977; Grau et al., 1981; Harnish et al., 1981a,b; Kiley et al., 1981; Martinez Segovia and de Mitri, 1977; Pedersen, 1973; Ramos et al., 1972; Vezza et al., 1977 Vezza et al., , 1978a . Embedded in the lipid envelope are 5to 10-nm-long, clubshaped surface projections of glycoprotein that appear to have a hollow axis Murphy and Whitfield, 1975; Vezza et al., 1977; Welsh et al., 1976) . The projections consist of either two distinct protein species present in essentially equal numbers (for Pichinde, LCM, Lassa, Mopeia, and Machupo viruses: G1, size: 50-72 x lo3 Da; G2, size: 34-41 X lo3 Da) or one size class of protein (for Junin, Tacaribe, and Tamiami viruses: G, size: 35-44 x lo3 Da). Estimates of the order of 400 molecules of each glycoprotein species have been reported for Pichinde virus preparations (Buchmeier et al., 1977; Vezza et al., 1977) . Unlike many other enveloped viruses (e.g., orthomyxoviruses), the surface projections appear to be sparsely arranged. Whether the single size class of glycoprotein for Junin, Tacaribe, and Tamiami viruses means that they only have one protein species, or whether they have two similarly sized proteins, is not known (see Grau et al., 1981) . The surface projections can be removed by protease digestion, leaving a spikeless particle that exhibits reduced infectivity Vezza et al., 1977) . As mentioned previously, the projections are embedded in the viral envelope, which is derived from the host cell plasma membrane. At the site of virus morphogenesis (budding), the plasma membrane has been observed to be denser than at other regions; the reason is not known (Murphy and Whitfield, 1975) . How the glycoproteins are embedded in the viral membrane and in what way 6 DAVID H. L. BISHOP they make liaisons with the internal components of the virus particle are also not known. A schematic representation of an arenavirus particle is given in Fig. 1 .",

They have been shown to be derived from a common glycosylated precursor [(GPC) size: -80 x lo3 Da; Buchmeier and Oldstone, 1979; Harnish et al., 1981a,b) ]. The nonglycosylated forms of the LCM and Pichinde virus GPC primary gene products have been deduced from DNA sequence analyses to have sizes of 56-57 x lo3 Da (Auperin et al., 1984b; Romanowski et al., 1985) . Tunicamycin studies have indicated a size of 42 x lo3 Da for the unglycosylated form of Pichinde virus GPC (Harnish et al., 1981a) . Whether removal of signal sequences from the initial gene product accounts for the difference is not known. Based on precursor incorporation data, more carbohydrate has been identified in association with Pichinde G1 than with G2 (Buchmeier et al., 1978; Martinez Segovia and De Mitri, 1977; Vezza et al., 1977) . This observation agrees with the sequence data for Pichinde virus (Auperin et al., 1984b) , which indicate that there are more potential asparagine-linked glycosylation sites on the amino-terminal (Gl) half of the glycoprotein primary gene product than on the carboxy-terminal half (G2). The viral glycoproteins are important for the initiation of the infection process, since their removal by proteases reduces virus infectivity .",

            "text": "The internal components of arenaviruses include two other viralcoded proteins. There are minor quantities of a large protein, L (size: 180-200 X lo3 Da), that is believed to be a transcriptase/replicase component, and large quantities of the nucleocapsid protein, N (size: 63-72 x lo3 Da). The latter constitutes some 60-70% of the total viral protein (Buchmeier and Oldstone, 1978b; Buchmeier et al., 1977; Gard et al., 1977; Ramos et al., 1972; Vezza et al., 1977) . Estimates of some 1500 molecules of N protein per virion have been reported 1978a,b) . It has been shown that the N protein is responsible for the antigenic cross-reactivity among the Tacaribe complex of arenaviruses (Buchmeier and Oldstone, 1978b) . The N protein is closely associated with the two viral RNA species (Buchmeier and Oldstone, 1978b; Gard et al., 1977; Ramos et al., 1972; Vezza et al., 1977) . The viral nucleocapsids have been isolated from virus preparations using nonionic detergents and salt (Farber and Rawls, 1975; Gard et al., 1977; Pedersen and Konigshofer, 1976; Vezza et al., 1977; Young et al., 1981) . The RNA within the viral nucleocapsids is sensitive to digestion with ribonuclease, indicating that the phosphodiester bonds of the viral RNA are accessible to the nuclease and are not protected by the nucleoprotein. The extended forms of the nucleocapsids are long and convoluted, 3-5 nm in diameter, and without any obvious helical symmetry . For Pichinde virus, 12-nm-diameter helical structures, presumably representing the condensed forms of the nucleocapsids, have been described (Young and Howard, 1983) . For Tacaribe virus, positive staining with uranyl acetate has revealed circular nucleocapsid structures of two size classes (1300 and 640 nm; Palmer et al., 19771, consistent with the existence of two viral RNA species but without a simple relationship to the published sizes of the viral RNA species. Similar results have been reported for Pichinde virus (Young et al., 1981) .",

            "text": "In addition to the protein, RNA, and envelope components of arenaviruses, a variety of other macromolecules have been identified in arenavirus preparations. These include host ribosomes, various RNA species, and enzymes. Reviews of this subject are available elsewhere (Compans and Bishop, 1985; Pedersen, 1979; Rawls and Leung, 1979) . The presence of ribosomes is a characteristic feature of arenaviruses that sets them apart from other families of viruses (Dalton et al., 1968; Murphy and Whitfield, 1975) . With regard to the question of the origins of the ribosomes and the other minor components, it should be borne in mind that arenaviruses are pleomorphic and form virus particles at the surfaces of cells. It is perhaps not surprising that virus morphogenesis may result in the acquisition of cellular components, including bulky host ribosomes if the processes of viral morphogenesis do not include ways for their exclusion. Other pleomorphic viruses (e.g., paramyxoviruses) do not exhibit this property, possibly because they have another internal structural protein, the matrix protein. Whether the arenavirus ribosomes have any function in the process involved in initiating an infection is not known. Leung and Rawls (1977) have shown that Pichinde virus grown in cells with thermolabile ribosomes yielded viruses that were able to productively infect other cells at temperatures that were nonpermissive for the viral ribosomes. It appears, therefore, that ribosomes are not essential for the infectivity of arenavirus particles. This does not mean, however, that competent ribosomes incorporated into arenavirus particles do not function upon gaining entry to a permissive cell (e.g., they may become involved in the translation of an associated mRNA or participate in the de nouo initiation of mRNA translation). Northern analyses have shown that among the minor RNA species that can be identified in extracts of purified virus preparations are the two S mRNA species (unpublished data). If such species are associated with the virion ribosomes, then they may be involved with the continued or de nouo synthesis of viral proteins after virus penetration.",

            "text": "In the rodent species vertical transmission appears to be frequent (transuterine, transovarian, as well as postpartum involving milk, saliva, or urine routes). Venereal transmission may also be involved in intraspecies infections (Matthews, 1982) . Interspecies transmission (e.g., to man) is thought to be caused by the acquisition of virus through contamination, due to either rodent infestations of dwellings (e.g., Lassa) or encounters in the field (e.g., Junin) or the laboratory (see Peters, 1984) . For transuterine or neonatally acquired virus infections, rodents usually become persistently infected and develop viremia and viruria, secreting virus throughout their life. An attribute of such infections is the hypoimmune response and coexistence of circulating antibody and virus. Depending on the host and virus species, experimental infections of adult rodents may be either inapparent (e.g., Tacaribe virus) or lethal (e.g., LCM virus). In neonates, experimental infection with Tacaribe virus is lethal; for LCM viruses a persistent infection is frequently induced (Matthews, 1982) . LCM virus infection of young rodents induces a chronic immune complex disease involving virus infection of lymphocytes and an overall immunodepression and possible autoimmune effects. Extensive reviews of this subject are available elsewhere (Johnson, 1985; Lehmann-Grube, 1971; Rawls et al., 1981) . The abilities of arenaviruses to elicit short-term acute or long-term persistent infections have been studied from the viewpoint of the virus strain, the host species, and in uitro culture (see Lehmann-Grube, 1971 ).",

Some studies have indicated that the host cell nucleus is required to obtain a productive infection and also that arenaviruses are inhibited by actinomycin D or a-amanitin (Banerjee et al., 1975 (Banerjee et al., -1976 Buck and Pfau, 1969; Carter et al., 1973b; Mifune et al., 1971; Rawls et al., 1976; Stanwick and Kirk, 1971 ). However, the intracellular pro-cesses in the replication cycle and their relationships to cellular functions are not understood in detail (see Pedersen, 1979) . In broad terms, the viral glycoproteins are involved in the adsorption, penetration, and uncoating process, although how these results are achieved is not known. Following uncoating, it is assumed that the viral polymerase synthesizes mRNA (presumably the S-coded N and the L-coded mRNA species). As described below, RNA replication must proceed before the S-coded GPC mRNA can be synthesized. With the availability of the newly synthesized gene products and replicated viral RNA, viral morphogenesis takes place a t the cell surface. The molecular steps involved in these processes have yet to be defined.",

Analyses of the 1.1 x lo6 Da sequences of each S RNA have, like the earlier genetic and biochemical studies, confirmed that two gene products are coded by the arenavirus S RNA. One (the 62-63 x lo3 Da N protein) is coded in a viral-complementary sequence corresponding to the 3' half of the viral RNA (Auperin et al., 1984a; Romanowski and Bishop, 1985) . The other (the 56-57 x lo3 Da primary gene product corresponding to GPC) is coded in the 5' half of the viral RNA in a viral-sense sequence (Auperin et al., 1984b; (Fig. 3) . Comparison of the gene products of Pichinde and LCM viruses indicates that the N proteins of the two viruses exhibit 51% direct amino acid sequence homology; the GPC primary gene products have only 39% sequence homology (Fig. 4) . It is of interest to note that in classical serological procedures such as the complement fixation test which assesses antigenic epitopes on the viral nucleocapsid protein, different arenaviruses have been shown to be related to each other to different extents . By these pro- cedures LCM virus is reported to exhibit little relationship to members of the New World arenaviruses; however, in such tests LCM virus has been shown to be distantly related to Lassa virus . A recent report of the DNA sequence of the part of the Lassa virus S RNA that codes for the viral nucleoprotein (i.e., the 3' half; Clegg and Oram, 1985) indicates that the Lassa viral N protein is related by primary sequence to both LCM and Pichinde viral N proteins. Some 62% of the Lassa and LCM N protein amino acids are identical and about 50% of the Lassa and Pichinde N protein residues (Clegg and Oram, 1985) . This result, as well as the Pichinde-LCM viral N protein relationships, was not expected from the serological experiments, nor from monoclonal antibody studies which have indicated that few N protein monoclonals of those that have been characterized are crossreactive between these viruses (Buchmeier et al., 1980 (Buchmeier et al., ,1981 . The fact, though, that some are cross-reactive is in agreement with the reported sequence relationships. The observation that most of the analyzed monoclonals are not cross-reactive may suggest that the conserved regions of the viral N proteins may not be as antigenic as the nonconserved regions. The same may well be true for the viral glycoproteins.",

They correspond to a viral-complementary N mRNA (as demonstrated by immune precipitation of N protein from in uitro translation products of the mRNA) and a viral-sense subgenomic species that is deduced to be the GPC mRNA species. The inability to bind Pichinde N mRNA to oligo(dT)-cellulose columns (Auperin et al., 1984b) indicates that the N mRNA species lacks 3' polyadenylated sequences.

Only partial sequence information has been reported for the L RNA of the WE strain of LCM virus  -1000 nucleotides from the 3' end). The limited data that have been obtained suggest that there is a gene product coded in the L RNA viral-complementary sequence (presumably the L protein). Northern analyses have so far only identified a single L mRNA species of approximately the same size as the viral L RNA (unpublished data). It may be, therefore, that the arenavirus L RNA has a simple negative strand coding arrangement. Alternatively, it may have an ambisense arrangement. Until the complete L RNA has been cloned and sequenced and the clones have been used to identify all of the L mRNA species, the answer will not be known.",

This is unlike the organization of the negative- stranded rhabdoviruses and paramyxoviruses which have been shown to synthesize all their (viral-complementary) mRNA species in a consecutive manner from the viral RNA. It is also unlike the negativestranded, segmented-genome orthomyxoviruses that also only code for proteins in their viral-complementary sequences. An advantage of the arenavirus S RNA strategy is that it allows the syntheses of the two Scoded mRNA species to be regulated independently so that different quantities of each can be made. Another feature is that the GPC mRNA (and protein) species are not synthesized until the time that they are required (i.e., after the onset of RNA replication and before initiation of the processes of viral morphogenesis).",

Conceivably, the curtailment of glycoprotein synthesis would prevent virus morphogenesis (or at least the synthesis of virus particles coated with the homologous viral protein) but may allow viral RNA replication to proceed.

The data for the intergenic region of Pichinde and LCM viruses is exemplified in Fig. 6 . Although there is no information on the transcription initiation and termination processes of mRNA synthesis from the S (or L) RNA species, in unpublished experiments using oligonucleotides representing viral and viral-complementary sequences of the intergenic region of Pichinde S RNA, we have found that transcription of both N and GPC mRNA species terminates near the top of the intergenic hairpin (see Fig. 6 ). Thus, oligonucleotides complementary to the 3' half of the intergenic hairpin anneal to the S mRNA species (both N and GPC mRNA), whereas those representing the 5' half do not. Both types of oligonucleotide anneal to complete size S RNA species (viral RNA and replicative intermediate S RNA). How transcription termination in the intergenic region is effected is not known.",

Such a chimeric RNA could have been formed during the processes of RNA replication and could represent a consolidation of genetic information (i.e., a virus with three RNAs each coding for a single gene product giving rise to an arenavirus with a consolidated genome and, subsequently, only two RNAs by the exclusion of the redundant third RNA species). Such consolidation of genetic information could occur by a viral replicase copying the coding strand of one RNA species and, instead of terminating, continuing RNA synthesis on the noncoding strand of another RNA. This would result in a chimeric RNA molecule composed of two genes coded on opposite strands of the RNA. Together with the subsequent loss of the redundant RNA species, a virus would be generated in which all the original genetic information had been conserved. Of course, the reverse situation may have occurred, i.e., the formation of a virus with three RNA species from a virus having two, one of which originally had an ambisense coding arrangement. Whatever the origins, the ambisense coding arrangements that have been observed for arenaviruses (and phleboviruses, see below) open yet another dimension to the way in which viruses replicate in cells.",

Two or three glycoproteins have been reported for Hazara virus, a member of the Nuirouirus genus (Clerx et al., 1981; Foulke et al., 1981) . Bunyaviridae viruses have internal components consisting of three nucleocapsids (Bouloy and Hannoun, 1976b; Obijeski et al., 1976b; Pettersson and von Bonsdorff, 1975; Samso et al., 1975) . Electron microscopic analyses of the nucleocapsids have revealed that they consist of coiled strands 2-3 nm in diameter that are occasionally observed to be circular and sometimes supercoiled with diameters between 7 and 12 nm (Obijeski et al., 1976b; Pettersson and von Bonsdorff, 1975; Pettersson et al., 1971; Saikku et al., 1971; Samso et al., 1975; von Bonsdorff et al., 1969) . Each nucleocapsid consists of a single species of RNA [large (L), medium (M), and small @)I, nucleoprotein (N), and minor quantities of a large 180-200 x lo3 Da protein (L protein) (Bouloy and Hannoun, 1976b; Obijeski et al., 1976b; Pettersson et al., 1971; Rosato et al., 1974b; Saikku et al., 1971; Samso et al., 1975; White, 1975) .",

Cloning and sequence analyses have shown that the 3' and 5' ends of each viral RNA are conserved and complementary in sequence (Akashi and Bishop, 1983; Akashi et al., 1984; Bishop et al., 1982; Cabradilla et al., 1983; Clerx-van Haaster and Bishop, 1980; Clerx-van Haaster et al., 1982a,b; Collett et al., 1985; Eshita and Bishop, 1984; Ihara et al., 1984, 198513; Obijeski et al., 1980; Parker and Hewlett, 1981) . The complementarity may account for the circular forms of the extracted viral RNA species (Hewlett et al., 1977; Samso et al., 1976) and the viral nucleocapsids (Obijeski et al., 1976b; Pettersson and von Bonsdorff, 1975; Samso et al., 1975) .",

In general, members of each serogroup are serologically more closely related to each other by particular tests (e.g., neutralization, hemagglutination inhibition) than to members of other serogroups, although, depending on the test, distant serological relationships have been demonstrated between representative members of different bunyavirus serogroups (see Bishop and Shope, 1979; Klimas et al., 1981b) .

From such analyses it has been determined that the S RNA of SSH bunyavirus codes for two proteins that are read from overlapping reading frames in viralcomplementary S mRNA sequences . These proteins are the viral N protein (26 x lo3 Da) and a nonstructural protein (NS,, 10 x lo3 Da). Protein and genetic analyses have confirmed these coding assignments as well as the existence of the S-coded N and NS, proteins (Fuller and Bishop, 1982; Fuller et al., 1983; Gentsch and Bishop, 1978; Gentsch et al., 1977b) . It has been shown ) that the SSH S mRNA species have 12-to 15-nucleotide-long, heterogeneous, 5' nonviral sequences that extend beyond the 3' end of the viral RNA (i.e., they probably represent host-derived, presumably capped RNA primers that are used by the viral transcriptase for S mRNA synthesis). Even taking into account these additional 5' sequences, size analyses of SSH and LAC S mRNA species have shown that they are some 85 nucleotides shorter than the viral S RNA (i.e., mRNA transcription terminates before the end of the template RNA is reached; Eshita et al., 1985; . Only a single SSH S mRNA species has been demonstrated by Northern hybridization, or by viral-sense oligonucleotide-directed reverse transcription and cloning analyses Eshita et al., 1985) . It has been concluded therefore from these and in uitro translation of purified S mRNA preparations that there is only one S mRNA species that serves for the synthesis of both SSH N and NS, proteins (Eshita et al., 1985; Fuller et al., 1983) . Previously Patterson and associates (1983) reported the probable existence of multiple LAC S mRNA species from an analysis using viral-sense oligonucleotide-directed reverse transcription and dideoxyribonucleotide incorporation, a result we have not been able to confirm using high levels of triphosphate and similar protocols (unpublished data). Subsequent studies by Patterson and associates (1984) identified a primer-stimulated RNA polymerase and methylated cap-dependent viral endonuclease, in agreement with the postulate that the LAC S mRNA has 5' nonviral primers like those identified for SSH mRNA species Eshita et al., 1985) . Recent studies have demonstrated the synthesis of SSH S mRNA species in virus-infected cells grown in the presence of protein synthesis inhibitors (puromycin or cycloheximide; Eshita et al., 1985) in agreement with the idea that bunyaviruses possess a virion transcriptase (Bouloy and Hannoun, 1976a; Bouloy et al., 1975) .",

Six serogroups of viruses are recognized, representing the perceived antigenic relationships of viruses in the genus (Casals and Tignor, 1980) . The viruses have been isolated from a variety of ticks and animals collected from many different ecological niches (Berge, 1975; Berge et al., 1970 Berge et al., , 1971 Bishop and Shope, 1979; Johnson et al., 1979; Karabatosos, 1978; Nuttall et al., 1984) . Members representing the six recognized nairovirus serogroups have comparable RNA and protein sizes that are distinct by comparison with those of representatives of the other Bunyaviridae genera. None of the RNA species has been cloned into DNA and sequenced. However, the estimated sizes of the nairovirus L, M, and S RNA species are 4-5 X lo6 Da (L), 1.5-1.9 X lo6 Da (MI, and 0.6-0.7 x lo6 Da (S) (Fig. 8; Clerx and Bishop, 1981; Clerx et al., 1981) . An example of the differences in the sizes of the viral RNA species of Qalyub (QYB) nairovirus, SSH, and Jerry Slough (JS) bunyaviruses and that of vesicular stomatitis (VSV) rhabdovirus is provided in Fig. 10 . Sequence analyses have demonstrated that the 3' end sequences of nairoviruses are different from those of bunyaviruses; phleboviruses, uukuviruses, and hantaviruses (Clerx-van Haaster and Clerx-van Haaster et al., 1982a,b) .",

In view of the observations that have been made, Hantaan virus has been proposed as a prototype virus for a fifth genus, the Hantuuirus genus.

The lack of any identified arthropod vector involved in Hantaan virus transmission contrasts with the evidence for arthropod transmission of many other members of the Bunyaviridae.",

Immunofluorescence techniques have been used to determine the virogenesis of LAC virus in Ae. triseriatus and to derive anatomic explanations of the unique vector-virus interactions (transovarial and venereal transmission) that are observed in this system. Thus, it has been shown that subsequent to oral infection, virus antigen can be detected in the pyloric portion of the arthropod midgut (6 days postinfection). By 10 days, the virus was found to have disseminated from the midgut and antigen was present in most secondary organ systems, including ovaries and salivary glands. It was observed that LAC virus infection was virtually pantropic in the arthropod, with most organ systems exhibiting large quantities of virus antigen. Detection of virus in ovarian follicles and in accessory sex gland fluid suggested anatomic explanations for the observed transovarial and venereal transmission of the virus Thompson, 1976, 1977) .",

The results that were obtained involving per os infection or intrathoracic inoculation (Beaty et al., 1981a (Beaty et al., , 1982 (Beaty et al., , 1985 indicated that the LAC viral M RNA gene products were the principal determinants of the efficiency of virus infection of that arthropod. Thus, reassortants containing a LAC M RNA (e.g., L/M/S genotypes such as SSH/LAC/SSH) produced disseminated infections and were transmitted by Ae. triseriatus mosquitoes with efficiencies comparable to that of LAC virus. By contrast, viruses with a SSH M RNA (e.g., LAC/SSH/LAC) were essentially as inefficiently transmitted as the parent SSH virus. Although attenuating mutations in other LAC RNA species may affect the LAC M gene property (Rozhon et al., 1981) , the major viral determinants of efficient vector transmission appear to be the LAC viral glycoproteins (Beaty et al., 1981a (Beaty et al., , 1982 .",

At present the data for the hantaviruses are limited, although the indications are that hantaviruses differ in many of their properties by comparison with members of the four established genera of the family.

Mechanical transmission of virus by arthropods (i.e., not involving virus replication in the insect species) may also occur on occasion. For viruses that are not transmitted by arthropods (e.g., Hantaan virus) transmission is believed to involve respiratory routes of infection. As discussed above, it appears that there is a restricted group of arthropods that is able to transmit any particular arbovirus member of the family. The molecular basis for this presumed restriction is not known, but it may involve inefficient virus replication so that not enough virus is produced (consequently prejudicing the possibility of transmission), or it may indicate that the virus does not reach the salivary gland (or other intermediary tissues). Alternatively there may be a total lack of cell receptors or host components that are necessary for the virus replication process. The observation that a virus species is sometimes recovered from a different species of arthropod no doubt reflects the fact that several types of insect feed on viremic animals. This occurrence may allow the selection of variant viruses that are suitable for transmission by new arthropod hosts. The amount of virus that is transmitted by arthropods is not known. It seems unlikely to be more than a few infectious virus particles in view of the small amounts of saliva that are transferred.",

The end result, though, is the release into the cell cytoplasm of the viral nucleocapsids. Again, the processes that follow are not understood in molecular detail. In broad terms it is believed that primary transcription of the viral mRNA species occurs in the cytoplasm of the infected cell. Primary transcription is catalyzed by the virion polymerase and can be demonstrated (at least for the S RNA) by the synthesis of viral-complementary mRNA in infected tissue culture cells grown in the presence of puromycin or cycloheximide to inhibit protein synthesis and virus replication (Eshita et al., 1985) . Whether all three viral RNA species are transcribed has not been determined. At least for those viruses that have been studied, the viral mRNA synthesis appears to involve the initial acquisition of (presumably capped) oligonucleotide primers from cellular RNA species (mRNA?) and their subsequent extension into the viral-complementary mRNA transcripts. To accomplish this feat the viral polymerase must recognize a suitable precursor RNA species and possibly scan that RNA molecule to identify and locate the 5' end sequence. It must then excise by an endonucleolytic activity the necessary oligonucleotide primer sequence and hold it in juxtaposition to the viral template RNA in order to catalyze the 3' extension of viral-complementary mRNA species.",

Elevated levels of infectious virus particles in the vascular system (viremia) permit transmission of virus to a feeding arthropod. For mosquitoes, sandflies, Culicoides, and the larval forms of ticks, only small amounts of blood are ingested. The success of transmission must therefore depend on the levels of infectious virus in the blood, the numbers of feeding arthropods, and the predisposition of the vertebrate to allow feeding. The latter may depend on the symp-toms of disease. In view of these factors, the possibility for clonal transmission of virus in nature is probably high (i.e., the transmission of a single infectious virus particle). The evolution of bunyaviruses involving the accumulation of point mutations, occasional codon deletions and duplications, and RNA reassortment, in concert with these transmission factors, probably accounts for the large number of distinct virus types that have been identified for the Bunyaviridae (Table  II-V) .",

Conserved properties include more basic attributes such as the form of the genetic information (RNA or DNA, single or double stranded) and the transcription and replication strat- egies-for example, the possession and use of a reverse transcriptase to synthesize a DNA intermediate during the replication of retroviruses. For the positive-stranded viruses (caliciviruses, flaviviruses, picornaviruses, togaviruses), a conserved character is the use of the viral RNA species as a messenger RNA. Among the negative-stranded viruses, the ability to synthesize viral-complementary mRNA species is a conserved feature (arenaviruses, bunyaviruses, orthomyxoviruses, paramyxoviruses, and rhabdoviruses). Of the latter viruses, the paramyxoviruses and rhabdoviruses share similar strategies of mRNA transcription. They both initiate mRNA species de nouo and have similar signals for transcription termination, polyadenylation, and leader RNA synthesis. This can be contrasted to the use of primers to synthesize mRNA species as exemplified by the orthomyxoviruses and members of the Bunyaviridae. Unlike bunyaviruses, orthomyxoviruses produce spliced as well as unspliced messenger RNA species (presumably one of the reasons why transcription of influenza viral mRNA occurs in the nucleus of infected cells).
