Viroporins are generally very small (<100 amino acids) integral membrane proteins that share common structure motifs (conserved cluster of basic residues adjacent to an amphipathic alpha-helix) but only limited sequence homology between viruses. Ion channel activity of viroporins is either required for replication or greatly enhances replication and pathogenesis. Channel characteristics have been investigated using standard electrophysiological techniques, including planar lipid bilayer, liposome patch clamp or whole-cell voltage clamp. In general, viroporins are voltage-independent non-specific monovalent cation channels, with the exception of the influenza A virus M2 channel that forms a highly specific proton channel due to a conserved HXXXW motif. Viroporin channel currents range between highly variable ('burst-like') fluctuations to well resolved unitary ('square-top') transitions, and emerging data indicates the quality of channel activity is influenced by many factors, including viroporin synthesis/solubilization, the lipid environment and the ionic composition of the buffers, as well as intrinsic differences between the viroporins themselves. Compounds that block viroporin channel activity are effective antiviral drugs both in vitro and in vivo. Surprisingly distinct viroporins are inhibited by the same compounds (e.g., amantadines and amiloride derivatives), despite wide sequence divergence, raising the possibility of broadly acting antiviral drugs that target viroporins. Electrophysiology of viroporins will continue to play a critical role in elucidating the functional roles viroporins play in pathogenesis and to develop new drugs to combat viroporin-encoding pathogens.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Viruses are obligate cellular parasites that require host cells to support their replication cycle, which utilizes virus-encoded proteins and nucleic acids to exploit cellular processes needed from progeny virus assembly. Many viruses have evolved their own ion channels to help subvert cellular ionic gradients to their advantage. These virus-encoded ion channels are called viroporins. Research on viroporins over the last 22 years has demonstrated that most (if not all) viroporins are bona fide ion channels, in that they can display unitary single channel conductance states. However, identification and characterization of new candidate viroporins is challenging due to the lack of sequence homology between viroporins, the wide array of small molecules that can be conducted through these proteins when expressed in exogenous systems such as E. coli, and differences in ion channel characteristics (Lamb and Pinto 1997; Gonzalez and Carrasco 2003; Kelly et al. 2003 ). This chapter will summarize the different approaches used to identify viroporins and to demonstrate bona fide ion channel activity, with a particular emphasis on how differences in experimental details may explain differences in ion channel characteristics.

While the initial concept of viroporins focused on proteins that induced cell lysis or permeability to small molecule compounds, such as hygromycin B, more recent studies using electrophysiology demonstrate viroporins are not simply large pores but are bona fide viral ion channels, distinguishing them from viral fusions domains found on viral attachment and entry proteins (Gonzalez and Carrasco 2003; Nieva et al. 2012) .

While PLB studies have driven forward viroporin electrophysiology more than patch clamp studies, a disadvantage of using PLB for viroporins is that often the induced currents are highly variable without discernable conductance states, as illustrated for HCV p7 in Fig. 7 .1a, but the same p7 peptide can also give rise to canonical unitary single channel states in separate experiments ( Fig. 7 .1b) (Premkumar et al. 2004 ). Further, the highly hydrophobic nature of most viroporins and the viroporin-domain peptides makes the choice of solvent important for generating high quality current recordings. Issues with solubility have been overcome by several different means, including reconstituting the viroporin into liposomes or addition of two flanking lysine resides (Torres et al. 2007 ). Nevertheless, clearly The unitary single channels were completely blocked by 100 \u03bcM hexamethylene amiloride (HMA), but HMA only partially blocked the larger 'burst-like' currents (not shown) (Premkumar 2004 ). (d) Single channel activity of HCV p7 is altered by the lipid composition of the lipid bilayer. In PC-rich membranes (left) p7 has a higher open probability than in PE-rich membranes (right). PC-rich membrane also promoted slightly higher single channel conductance of the main conductance states and the subconductance state (arrows) (Whitfield 2011) resolvable conductance states are observed for most viroporins, which may occur between 'burst events' (Henkel et al. 2010) , enabling measurement of single channel conductance and ion permeability. Interestingly, most viroporins display multiple distinct single channel conductance levels and subconductance states, which are observed within single traces and are reproducible between experiments (Chien et al. 2013; Ewart et al. 2002; Henkel et al. 2010; Montserret et al. 2010; Piller et al. 1999; Verdia-Baguena et al. 2013 ).

The rationale for testing M2 for ion channel activity was based on amantadine and ramantadine inhibiting early steps in the low pH-dependent disassembly of viral ribonucleoprotein complexes during entry, as well as protecting the hemagglutinin protein (HA) from a premature conformational change during transit through the trans Golgi (Pinto et al. 1992) . Amantadine resistant mutants mapped to the transmembrane domain of M2 protein, a small (~100 amino acid) tetrameric protein that is abundant in the Golgi and plasma membrane of host cells, and a minor component of the virion (23-60 copies) (Pinto et al. 1992) , suggesting a direct role for M2 in modulating pH in infected cells. Whole-cell voltage clamp of Xenopus oocytes was performed using expressed wild-type M2 (A/Udorn/72) or an amantadine-resistant M2 mutant. A large inward current was detected in the WT M2-expressing cells. This current was greater than endogenous currents, was inhibited by 10 \u03bcM amantadine, and activated~7-fold by decreasing the pH from 7.5 to 6.2; however, while similar currents were produced by the M2 mutants, they were not blocked by 100 \u03bcM amantadine (Pinto et al. 1992) .

The functional role(s) of PB1-F2 are still being elucidated; however, at least one of its primary roles is the induction of cellular apoptosis by activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway (Chanturiya et al. 2004) . Structural studies indicate PB1-F2 forms a positively charged amphipathic alpha-helix and has a high propensity for oligomerization. A mitochondrial localization sequence was first defined to be between amino acids 65-87 (Gibbs et al. 2003) and then refined to amino acids 46-75, with two conserved basic residues (Lys73 & Arg75) to be required for trafficking to mitochondria and association with the inner and outer mitochondrial membranes (Yamada et al. 2004) . Localization of PB1-F2 to mitochondria resulted in a loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, release of cytochrome c and induction of apoptosis (Gibbs et al. 2003) . The first study to examine the potential ion channel function of PB1-F2 used planar lipid bilayers of various compositions (Chanturiya et al. 2004 ). Addition of PB1-F2 to PLB chambers induced currents without typical unitary fluctuations of channels and the lack of transitions was not influenced by different lipid or buffer compositions; however, the observed currents were greatest with neutral lipids in monovalent cation-based solutions. PB1-F2 is selective for cations over anions, but addition of Ca 2+ increased Cl \u2212 permeability. Based on the membrane destabilization and lack of discrete channel-like behavior, PB1-F2 was thought to form lipidic pores rather than proteinaceous channels (Chanturiya et al. 2004 ). However, a recent study of a synthetic PB1-F2 peptide in phosphatidylcholine bilayers found that typical channel events were observed among the unresolved fast fluctuations.

In liposome patch clamp of NSP4 in asymmetric buffers (pipette 150 mM KCl; bath 75 mM CaCl2), single channels were observed with both positive and negative pipette voltages, indicating NSP4 can conduct both K + and Ca 2+ , although contribution of Cl \u2212 cannot be ruled out (Hyser and Delcour, unpublished data, 2015) . Of particular interest is how viroporins such as NSP4 and 2B, but not other ER-localized viroporins (e.g., HIV-1 Vpu), release ER Ca 2+ .

This motif is selective for Ca 2+ and Ba 2+ , but not Mg 2+ , and binding is lost at pH <5.6, which corresponds with a conversion of the protein from a Ca 2+bound tetramer to a Ca 2+ -free pentamer with an open central channel (Sastri et al. 2014) .

The primary exception to this have been recombinant viroporins from HIV-1 Vpu and alphavirus 6K expressed in Xenopus oocytes, where strong Cl \u2212 currents were detected by whole cell voltage clamp (Coady et al. 1998; Melton et al. 2002; Antoine et al. 2007) . Such was also the case for enterovirus 71 (EV71) 2B. Recombinant EV71 2B was expressed in Xenopus oocytes and large hyperpolarization-dependent currents were detected, but not for a transmembrane deletion mutant. Replacing Cl \u2212 with gluconate reduced currents and the current was blocked by the well-characterized chloride channel blocker DIDs, while replacing Na + with NMDG had little effect, which suggested the invoked currents were carried by Cl \u2212 . The authors postulated that the 2B anion channel activity may cause elevated Ca 2+ indirectly by reducing ATP synthesis or by disrupting anion balance across the Golgi membrane, causing leakiness to Ca 2+ (Xie et al. 2011 ). However, this study did not address the possible indirect activation of oocyte Ca 2+ -activated chloride channels (CaCC), similar to what was determined for the Sindbis virus 6K protein expressed in oocytes (Antoine et al. 2007 ).

However, it is safe to say that the viroporin field is still in its infancy, with many more questions remaining about viroporin biology to answer. Of primary importance to understanding viroporin electrophysiology is continued efforts to develop robust methods for expression, purification, and analysis of viroporins. This is particularly important because of the tendency of viroporins to induce highly variable \"burst-like\" currents rather than the canonical (and sought after) clear unitary conductance states (i.e., square-topped channel activity). While the burst-like activity is still likely true ion channel activity, it makes it more difficult to quantify the channel characteristics and therefore inpairs direct comparisons between different studies. This is further compounded by the fact that viroporins are able to adopt multiple oligomeric states, which is particularly true for peptides of the isolated transmembrane domains. Work to design and test peptides that adopt specific oligomeric states, such as with the Vpu tetramer versus pentamer, demonstrated these different oligomers may have different channel characteristics (Becker et al. 2004) . Further, the evidence that the lipid environment and ionic concentration impact viroporin channel characteristics suggests these variables are important considerations for optimization of clear channel recordings (Whitfield et al. 2011; Verdia-Baguena et al. 2012 . Establishing a systematic methodology for the reconstitution and testing of viroporins is needed to facilitate comparison between currently known viroporins, and to provide an experimentally robust framework for the testing of newly discovered viroporins, such as the papillomavirus E5 and ephemeral fever rhabdovirus \u03b11 proteins, as well as many others (Wetherill et al. 2012; Joubert et al. 2014) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1301, "end": 1321, "text": "(Becker et al. 2004)", "ref_id": "BIBREF4"}, {"start": 1537, "end": 1560, "text": "(Whitfield et al. 2011;", "ref_id": "BIBREF105"}, {"start": 1561, "end": 1587, "text": "Verdia-Baguena et al. 2012", "ref_id": "BIBREF96"}, {"start": 1944, "end": 1967, "text": "(Wetherill et al. 2012;", "ref_id": "BIBREF104"}, {"start": 1968, "end": 1988, "text": "Joubert et al. 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF41"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Summary and Future Directions"}, {"text": "The majority of viroporins identified were tested due to similarities between a protein of interest and a known viroporin, typically based on transmembrane domain location and topology, and general sequence similarities in the viroporin signature motifs (polybasic domain and amphipathic \u03b1-helix). Using this methodology, the viroporins identified to date all have relatively non-specific cation channel activity, with the notable exception of IAV M2, which is a very specific proton channel (Chizhmakov et al. 1996) . This raises the question of whether current methods to identify viroporins are too narrow and therefore only identifying those proteins that have similar functions, i.e., non-specific cation channels. While many classically defined viroporins have yet to be examined using electrophysiological techniques [reviewed in (Nieva et al. 2012; Giorda and Hebert 2013) ], it is likely that we have only scratched the surface for identifying and characterizing viral ion channels. Given the fundamental importance ion channels play in cellular homeostasis, it is inconceivable to think viroporins are not found among viruses from all of the kingdoms of life, including among bacterial and archeal phages. A likely example in bacteriophage are pinholins, which induce cell lysis by depolarization of the host membrane but are too small to allow passage of endolysins like their larger cousins the holins (Young 2014) . No candidate ion channels have been reported for archeal phages, and with the exception of the Kcv potassium channel in Phycodnaviridae, ion channels in protozoan and plate viruses remain unexplored. Since viroporins of mammalian viruses have proven to be a key aspect of pathogenesis, as well as exceptional models for minimalistic ion channel structure/function experiments, the search for viroporins from other groups of viruses represents a new challenge for collaboration between microbiologists and physiologists, particularly because electrophysiology equipment and expertise are not a typical part of the virologist's experimental armamentarium. Further, because there is little primary amino acid sequence similarity among viroporins, protein sequence alignments are unlikely to yield identification of promising candidates across kingdoms. Therefore, new ways to identify viroporin motifs, perhaps capitalizing on the biophysical requirements needed for ion channel formation (e.g., clustered basic residues and high amphipathicity), are needed to search through the huge amount of sequence data becoming available from next-generation genomic and metagenomic sequencing of environmental, animal and human samples.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 492, "end": 516, "text": "(Chizhmakov et al. 1996)", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}, {"start": 837, "end": 856, "text": "(Nieva et al. 2012;", "ref_id": "BIBREF64"}, {"start": 857, "end": 880, "text": "Giorda and Hebert 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF26"}, {"start": 1414, "end": 1426, "text": "(Young 2014)", "ref_id": "BIBREF112"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Summary and Future Directions"}, {"text": "In conclusion, the current electrophysiological knowledge of viroporins demonstrates that they are truly unconventional ion channels.

Further, viroporins invariably play critical functional roles for virus replication and pathogenesis and in many cases, specific blockers make effective antiviral drugs.
