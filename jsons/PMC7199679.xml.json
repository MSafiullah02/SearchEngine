Any drug that interrupts the binding of spike protein with the ACE2 receptor will be useful in the treatment of COVID-19.",

Recent studies showed that beta-adrenergic blockers reduced the mortality in septic shock patients [3]. Beta-adrenergic blockers also showed beneficial effects in ARDS and respiratory failure patients [4], [5]. Beta-adrenergic blockers by its inhibitory action on the sympathetic system negatively regulate renin release by Juxtaglomerular (JG) cells in the kidney. A decrease in renin may reduce the activity in both arms of RAAS and may decrease ACE2, which may decrease the SARS-CoV-2 virus entry into the host cell.",

I propose that beta-adrenergic blockers may be beneficial in COVID-19 patients with hypertension comorbidity, by regulation of blood pressure and decreasing SARS-CoV-2 cellular entry. In low doses, beta-adrenergic blockers may be beneficial in COVID-19 patients with normal blood pressure, as it may decrease the SARS-CoV-2 entry into the cell. I suggest doing a retrospective study on the COVID-19 patients, who were already on beta-adrenergic blockers for their previous cardiovascular illness and its effect on mortality. The proposed retrospective study will test the validity of the hypothesis and clarify the role of beta-adrenergic blockers in COVID-19 patients.",

A) Beta-adrenergic blockers by its inhibitory action on the sympathetic system decrease the renin release by Juxtaglomerular (JG) cells in the Kidney. A decrease in renin may reduce the activity in both arms and may decrease ACE2 receptors. B) Decreased ACE2 receptors will affect the SARS-CoV-2 cellular entry and thereby reduce the viral infectivity. Beta-adrenergic blockers have been shown to reduce the mortality rate in ARDS, septic shock and respiratory failure. Beta-adrenergic blockers will be beneficial in COVID-19 patients in two ways, by reducing the SARS-CoV-2 virus cellular entry and by reducing the complications like ARDS, Septic shock and respiratory failure in severe cases.",
