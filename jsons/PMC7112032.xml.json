Early in autophagy a fold of membrane, known as the isolation membrane, curves around cytoplasmic cargo destined for degradation. The ends of the isolation membrane join together to form a double membranous vesicle. This new structure, known as an autophagosome, fuses with the lysosome forming the autolysosome, which is rich in hydrolases that act to enzymatically catabolize the vesicular contents (Juhasz and Neufeld, 2006). By isolating and then directing organelles and large biomolecules toward the lysosome, autophagy enables the cell to break down and redistribute molecules to pathways that are more critical for cell survival.",

Autophagy degrades some intracellular pathogens, such as Mycoplasma tuberculosis and herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) (Gutierrez et al., 2004, Jiang et al., 2011; Talloczy et al., 2006). Interestingly, some viruses utilize the autophagosome to promote viral replication, translation, and regulate cell lysis (Hussein et al., 2012, Meng et al., 2012, Meng et al., 2012, Dreux et al., 2009, Sir et al., 2012, Zhou and Munger, 2009, O\u05f3Donnell et al., 2011). Many RNA virus including poliovirus, coxsackievirus, coronavirus, and hepatitis C virus induce autophagy levels in the infected host cell to benefit the viral life cycle (Dreux et al., 2009, Wong et al., 2008, Taylor and Kirkegaard, 2008, Maier and Britton, 2012). RNA viruses are thought to utilize the double membranous autophagosome structure as a platform for promoting viral transcription or replication (Maier and Britton, 2012).",

As BKPyV is an intracellular pathogen, its life cycle is intimately connected with its host cell. Previous studies have shown the BKPyV requires vesicular acidification during the infectious process, but the virus does not seem to use the canonical endosome\u2013lysosome pathway (Eash and Atwood, 2005, Eash et al., 2004, Jiang et al., 2009).

Sodium hydroxide was added to amino acid-supplemented media so that media had identical pH levels. Increasing the concentration of amino acids led to a decrease in BKPyV infection in host cells indicating that higher levels of amino acids hinder BKPyV infectivity. Addition of amino acids did not lead to a change in Vero cell death or proliferation (Fig. 1B). One hypothesis is that cells treated with amino acids have lower autophagy levels, as nutrient deprivation is a major activator of cellular autophagy. To evaluate the level of autophagy in amino acid supplemented cells, a plasmid encoding microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 fused to green fluorescent protein (LC3-GFP) was transfected into cells. LC3 is distributed in a diffuse pattern throughout the cytoplasm in the presence of low levels of autophagy (LC3-I), and acquires a distinct punctate distribution during autophagy (LC3-II) (Mizushima, 2004, Kabeya et al., 2000). LC3-GFP transfected cells were treated with 100 nM rapamycin, a drug known to activate autophagy, in media with different concentrations of amino acids. 24 h later the number of LC3-GFP+ punctae per cell was scored for 80 cells. Addition of amino acids led to a decrease in the number of LC3-GFP+punctae per cell suggesting that amino acid supplementation suppressed autophagy (Fig. 1C).",

            "text": "To determine whether autophagy is important in BKPyV infection, host cells were treated with pharmacological agents that affect autophagy levels, infected with BKPyV, and stained for VP1 72 h post infection. Rapamycin is a drug that inactivates the protein mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), a kinase that promotes cell growth and protein synthesis. Rapamycin also elevates autophagy levels (Meng et al., 2012, Noda and Ohsumi, 1998). Vero cells treated with 100 nM rapamycin showed elevated BKPyV infection levels compared to DMSO-treated cells indicating that inhibition of mTOR elevates infection (\nFig. 2A and F). 3-MA is an inhibitor of autophagy that blocks phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) activation, an event that is necessary for membrane trafficking during autophagy (Blommaart et al., 1997, Petiot et al., 2000). Cells treated with 3-MA showed a dose-dependent decrease in infection (Fig. 2B and F) suggesting that autophagy promotes BKPyV infection. Rapamycin was able to restore infection to 3-MA-treated Vero cells (Fig. 2C). Another autophagy inhibitor, spautin-1, degrades class III PI3K by inhibiting the activity of the ubiquitin specific peptidases, USP10 and USP13 (Mateo et al., 2013, Liu et al., 2011). Spautin-1 also reduced BKPyV infection in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 2D and F). Vero cells treated with bafilomycin A1, a vacuolar H+ ATPase inhibitor that blocks lysosomal acidification that is necessary for both autophagic degradation and endosome maturation, were also less susceptible to BKPyV infection suggesting that vesicular acidification is important for BKPyV infection (Fig. 2E and F) (Tanigaki et al., 2003). Taken together these data suggest that autophagy may be important in BKPyV infection. A trypan blue exclusion assay verified that the pharmacological agents used in this study no statistically significant difference in cytotoxicity compared to no drug control (Supplemental Fig. 1). BKPyV-infected HeLa cells, which are permissive to BKPyV and have similar infection kinetics to Vero cells, showed nearly identical infection levels after drug treatments (Supplemental Fig. 2). When VP1 staining was compared in untreated cells infected with BKPyV for 3 h versus 72 h, VP1 nuclear staining was only observed in the 72 h condition indicating that input virus canot cause the strong nuclear signal dize in Fig. 2F (data not shown).",

Of the 60 cells that were analyzed, 27% (n=16) of cells showed viral particles had penetrated the cell membrane and entered the host cell. Analysis of the infected cells revealed that 38% of these cells (6/16 cells) showed strong colocalization of BKPyV and LC3-GFP+ in small or large autophagosomes. This differed from the 0% of cells (0/16 cells) that showed BKPyV colocalized with the diffusely expressed, non-autophagic LC3-GFP+. Our data suggest that BKPyV is more likely to colocalize with LC3-GFP+ when it is found in an autophagosome. This colocalization of BKPyV with the LC3-GFP+ autophagosomes was observed at 3 h post infection, indicating that the virus associates with an autophagic vesicle at a time point consistent with endocytic trafficking (\nFig. 5A\u2013D).",

Autophagy may have evolved as an antimicrobial defense process because its degradative function within the cell eliminates some invading microbes. For example, autophagy is believed to control and degrade both Sindbis virus and herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) (Liang et al., 1998; Talloczy et al., 2006). HSV-1 is equipped with a viral protein called ICP34.5, which inactivates autophagy. HSV-1 mutants missing ICP34.5 show greater autophagic degradation and an attenuated neurovirulence phenotype in mice (Talloczy et al., 2006; Orvedahl et al., 2007). Autophagy has also been shown to stimulate the innate immune system and link it to the adaptive immune system. Autophagy can promote antigen processing and presentation on major histocompatibility (MHC) molecules (Dengjel et al., 2005). Autophagosomes have been reported to help transport microbial cargo towards the lysosome where toll like receptor (TLR) engagement leads to Type I interferon production and other innate immune responses (Lee et al., 2007). Moreover, surface TLR engagement and signaling can activate autophagy (Xu et al., 2007). Mutations and deletions in autophagy genes are also associated with intestinal inflammation, disrupted Paneth cell secretion, and altered gut microflora (Virgin and Levine, 2009).",

There are multiple ways that autophagy promotes viral infection. RNA viruses require intracellular membranes to serve as scaffolds for viral replication within the cytoplasm (Salonen et al., 2005). Autophagy orchestrates the trafficking of vesicles to new locations within the cell thereby providing new membranous structures for viral replication to occur. Autophagy proteins have also been shown to aid in the translation of Hepatitis C virus proteins as well as viral replication (Sir et al., 2012; Dreux et al., 2009). Some DNA viruses also utilize autophagy. For example, adenovirus and the E7 protein of human papillomavirus 16 (HPV16) induce autophagy, which researchers hypothesize stimulates host cell death resulting in greater release of viral progeny (Zhou and Munger, 2009, Rodriguez-Rocha et al., 2011).",

JC polyomavirus T-antigen (T-Ag) was found to suppress expression of a host autophagy gene called Bag3. Overexpression of Bag3 in host cells, results in elevated autophagy levels and decreases JC infection. These data suggest that autophagy acts as an anti-viral process in JC polyomavirus infection (Sariyer et al., 2012). In contrast, elevation of host autophagy occurs when cells were made to express small t-antigen of simian virus 40 (SV40), a polyomavirus family member related to BKPyV (Kumar and Rangarajan, 2009). The small t antigen seems to help the cells to survive and respond to low nutrient conditions by stimulating host AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). When AMPK is activated it inactivates mTOR and thus increases the amount of autophagy occurring within the cell. These steps are thought to block premature host cell death during the viral life cycle, a state that would maximize viral production (Kumar and Rangarajan, 2009). Whether polyomavirus large and small t-antigen have opposing roles in controlling autophagy or if autophagy influences individual polyomaviruses members differently has yet to be determined.",

Pharmacological autophagy inhibitors, high amino acid concentrations, and knockdown of autophagy genes reduced BKPyV infection, while rapamycin treatment led to an increase in BKPyV infection. BKPyV is sensitive to autophagy inhibitors during the first 8 h of infection, a time period consistent with viral entry and intracellular trafficking (Eash and Atwood, 2005, Eash et al., 2004, Jiang et al., 2009). Interestingly we did note that addition of autophagy inhibitors from 24 to 48 h post infection increases BKPyV infection of Vero cells (Fig. 3). We also observed a similar increase in infection levels when autophagy inhibitors were added 16\u201324 h following infection (data not shown). From 16 to 48 h post infection, T-Ag transcription and protein production, viral replication, and V-Ag protein production occur in this sequential order (Jiang et al., 2009). Therefore it is possible that at this time frame, autophagy acts has an antiviral mechanism by degrading newly translated viral proteins. Addition of autophagy inhibitors midway through the viral lifecycle may allow more viral protein synthesis and virion assembly to occur. Eukaryotic cells respond to stressful stimuli using autophagy and the unfolded protein response. Recent evidence suggests that Rab1 protein may have important roles in both pathways (Chua and Tang, 2013). Therefore pharmacologically blocking autophagy between 16 h and 48 h post viral challenge may elevate BKPyV infection by reducing the unfolded protein response allowing translation to proceed despite ER-stress.",

Upon caveolae-mediated endocytosis, BKPyV enters the cell and requires some acidification event in the first few hours following infection (Eash et al., 2004; Jiang et al., 2009). Dynamic microtubules are thought to help shuttle viral particles to the ER where virus localizes at 8\u201312 h following adsorption (Jiang et al., 2009). Within the ER, capsid disassembly occurs. BKPyV also utilizes the proteasome and ER-associated degradation pathway (ERAD) to help BKPyV exit from the ER and for viral DNA accumulate in the cytoplasm (Jiang et al., 2009; Bennett et al., 2013). Nuclear transport of viral DNA then occurs.",

            "text": "This is the first report indicating that autophagy plays a role in BKPyV infection of host cells. Our study indicates that BKPyV localizes to the autophagosome 3 h post infection and that autophagy aids in productive BKPyV invasion of host cells. While the exact reason for this BKPyV-autophagosome interaction has yet to be elucidated, there are many possible explanations. First, an autophagosome may facilitate trafficking the virus towards the ER for viral disassembly. Autophagosomes use microtubules to shuttle themselves towards the lysosome to and group together with other autophagosomes in perinuclear regions (Jahreiss et al., 2008, Mackeh et al., 2013, Bouzas-Rodriguez et al., 2012). Drug studies show that microtubule assemble and disassembly is necessary for BKPyV infection (Eash and Atwood, 2005; Jiang et al., 2009). Therefore BKPyV may utilize the coordinated interaction between the autophagosome and microtubules to be shuttle closer to the ER. BKPyV does not seem to use the canonical early to late endosomal pathway to reach the ER, so this alternative trafficking strategy is a possibility ((Eash and Atwood, 2005; Eash et al., 2004; Jiang et al., 2009) personal communication with Mengxi Jiang and Michael J. Imperiale).",

            "text": "Another second possibility is that BKPyV interacts with the autophagosome to utilize the low pH and hydrolase-rich environment during the autophagosome\u2013lysosome fusion process. Other studies have shown that acidification is necessary for viral infection (Mateo et al., 2013, Mackeh et al., 2013) Moreover, BKPyV infection requires an acidification event to occur within 2 h following infection (Eash et al., 2004; Jiang et al., 2009). BKPyV may utilize this low pH environment or specific enzymes that become activated in low pH to modify its capsid or partially degraded structural proteins. A third possibility is that stimulating autophagy may promote a pro-survival cell response that primes the cell to deal with the stress of a viral infection. In some cells types, autophagy is reported to inhibit cell death, and this block is cell death has been associated with greater viral yield (Kumar and Rangarajan, 2009, Tovilovic et al., 2013, Tovilovic et al., 2013, Joubert et al., 2012). Conversely for some viruses, activation of autophagy leads to apoptosis, which increases the number of viral particles for same virus species (Xi et al., 2013, Shai et al., 2013).",

Cells were treated for the indicated times before or after BKPyV infection with 5 mM 3-MA, 5 uM Spautin-1, 100 nM bafilomycin-A, and the media- or DMSO-control. Cells were fixed at 72 h post infection, and infection was determined by scoring the number of VP1 expressing cells. The effect of the drugs on infection levels was calculated by comparing the average number of infected cells in control-treated conditions to the average number of infected cells in inhibitor-treated cells.
