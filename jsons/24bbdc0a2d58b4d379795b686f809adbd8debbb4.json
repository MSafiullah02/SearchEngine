The influenza virus periodically undergoes a major antigenic shift resulting in a 'new' virus to which the population has no immunity. Pandemic influenza is a global outbreak resulting from these major antigenic changes. Although experts are certain that another influenza pandemic will occur, the timing and pattern is unpredictable. In the last century, three pandemics occurred: the 1918-1919 Spanish Flu, the 1957 Asian Flu and the 1968 Hong Kong Flu. The Spanish Flu resulted in over 20 million deaths worldwide. 1, 2 Federal pandemic influenza response planning has taken place but it is also essential that local planning occur. Planning in rural districts can be challenging, due to dispersed populations and multiple municipalities. The testing of plans is important to ensure their effectiveness and to identify any gaps in the local response. 3 The Leeds, Grenville and Lanark area is a predominantly rural region spanning 6,454 square kilometres with a population of approximately 160,000. The area is made up of mainly rural communities. Brockville is the largest city, with a population of 21,000. 4 A year prior to the exercise, a local Pandemic Influenza Planning Committee was established. This committee's mandate was to develop a contingency plan for pandemic influenza. Local preparedness plans are extremely important because there is limited capacity for federal support for a situation that potentially affects the whole country. 3, 5 After its completion, the pandemic influenza response plan was presented and distributed to a network of stakeholder agencies.",
