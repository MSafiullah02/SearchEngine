Since this early vaccine, the principle has been applied to control diseases caused by members of many virus families affecting humans and animals with much benefit. Although many viral diseases of production animals are truly global, there are viruses that are at present only found in some parts of the world. These viruses may however spread to other geographical regions and/or broaden their host range as has been the case for Bluetongue Virus and West Nile virus (WNV). The global viral diseases have vaccines against them while many of the regional viral diseases have no immunoprophylaxis for their control. In this respect, noteworthy example is that for the newly emergent paramyxoviruses in the genus nipah virus.",

            "text": "The goal of vaccination is to induce immunity in a particular species to prevent clinical disease, excretion or infection by a pathogenic micro-organism. Since the first smallpox vaccine by Jenner, numerous different approaches for vaccination have been developed. Traditionally vaccine formulations are divided in two major classes, live and inactivated (Table 1\n). Live vaccines contain attenuated or non-pathogenic strain of a pathogen or an expression vector. Such a vaccine is unable to induce disease but is able to induce suitable immunity; over-attenuation is a potential risk a vaccine scientist has to be aware of. It is the challenge for the vaccine developer to find the right balance between the virulence of the vaccine virus and its ability to replicate sufficiently in order to induce immunity. Attenuation can be achieved by many different ways (some examples are given in Table 1). For this, approaches used have been passaging of a pathogen in cell cultures, derivation and/or isolation of temperature sensitive mutants, which are restricted for significant replication in internal body organs. The use of related apathogenic strain by Jenner is yet another example. More modern methodology would involve the use of molecular biological techniques to remove virulence genes from a pathogen or to engineer non-pathogenic, replicating agents to express immunity inducing antigenic epitopes of a pathogen. Replication-defective vectors have also been developed as safe effective vaccines for some viral diseases. Live vaccines generally induce both Th1 and Th2 immune response and have been used in situations where antibody responses are not correlated with protection or where existing circulating antibody interferes with the induction of immunological response; interference due to maternally derived antibody (MDA) in un-weaned host is a common problem, particularly for killed vaccines administered parenterally.",

Killed vaccines generally induce humoral immune responses and often require the use of adjuvants to boost the immune response. Adjuvants can play a major role in the direction of the immune response. Aluminium hydroxide for instance is a strong inducer of humoral immune responses, whereas others such as saponins and derivatives may induce cellular responses as well [[2], and references therein]. As is the case with live vaccines, different inactivated vaccine formulations are known, such as inactivated whole virus vaccines, subunit vaccines, peptide vaccines, and split virion vaccines.",

At this stage it is relevant to refer to the regulatory legislation controlling viral diseases of livestock in the European Union [3], [4], [5] and the vaccine development process from an industrial perspective as such [2]. It is important to point out in this respect that essential performance data are frequently limited to company registration dossiers and little information on safety and efficacy is therefore in the public domain. For many diseases validated challenge models to assess efficacy are non-existent and moreover, for some vaccines, efficacy data often come from field trials. Notwithstanding these drawbacks, in this article views on the shortcomings of some vaccines are offered and some ideas for improvements are proposed.",

A majority of commercially available EIV vaccines have egg-grown EIV of both subtypes and are either killed whole virus or EIV surface glycoprotein subunit vaccines containing different adjuvants [13].

An important observation was the induction of tolerance by killed vaccines in horses with MDA [17]. It is known for a long time that much more durable responses (humoral and cellular immunity, conferring protection) occur following EIV infection. Thus, live attenuated EIV vaccines mimicking natural infection should afford far superior protection than killed vaccines. However, in reality only one live attenuated ts (cold-adapted) H3N8 strain vaccine has come on the market in the USA but nowhere else yet [18]. In the EU, EIV is offered as two separate canary poxvirus recombinants expressing the HA of H3N8 EIV of European and American lineages. This vaccine, formulated in carbomer adjuvant was shown to induce both humoral and cellular immune responses [13]. Iscomatrix adjuvanted vaccines induce cellular immune responses in various animal models as well [19], although not evidenced in the horse yet. The optimal vaccination schedule for equine influenza is currently under evaluation [20]. Not all vaccines offer the best protection upon a traditional vaccination schedule [17], whereas others do [2].",

VEEV replication is usually confined to the viscera with 10\u201320% mortality while WEEV and EEEV, after visceral virus replication, also localise in the central nervous system (CNS), resulting in 20\u201330% and 80\u201390% mortality, respectively. Immunoprophylaxis against these viruses is with killed, adjuvanted vaccines, some also containing WNV. For instance, Innovator EWT (Fort Dodge Animal Health) contains WNV, EEEV, WEEV and tetanus toxoid.",

AHSV is pantropic, with pneumonic and visceral replication and is endemic in parts of Africa [22] and has sporadically crossed into Southern Europe and parts of the Middle East [23]. Annual vaccination is with polyvalent multi-serotype mouse-brain or tissue culture grown live virus vaccine. Future vaccines may use AHSV surface VP2 protein as a subunit bio-tech vaccine [24] or VP2 plasmid as a DNA vaccine. The pathogenesis and epidemiology of AHS have similarities to infection of ruminants by another important veterinary Orbivirus namely bluetongue virus (see Sheep viruses below). For both viruses, biting midges of species Culicoides imicola and others are important in transmission. Although AHS is an important disease of equidae, the economy has not warranted vaccine development for US or EU markets.",

Intervet's Bovipast for instance is a vaccine with such a composition (BRSV, PIV-3 and Pasteurella), which is successfully used for many years. There is a growing interest to market live and killed glycoprotein E deficient (gE\u2212) BHV-1 vaccines [30], [31] with a view for use as marker and DIVA (see below) vaccines in eradication campaigns. Recent studies have shown that an inactivated BVDV vaccine does have some properties of a marker vaccine as antibodies against viral non-structural protein NS3 are not produced or occur at low concentration in vaccinated animals [32]. The latter would however negate the marker vaccine claim since a definitive distinction between vaccinated and field infected cattle would not be possible. Also the efficacy of most registered BHV-1 vaccines is against respiratory disease, namely infectious bovine rhinotracheitis (IBR) and not genital lesions [31]. It is important to be aware that vaccination does not completely prevent virus shedding from the respiratory tract [31], [27], [28].",

The other two abortion efficacy studies allowed the ongoing pregnancy to go to term naturally when BVDV positive foetuses and newly born calves were assessed for BVDV infection. BVDV challenge methods also differed; a natural challenge by 3 persistently BVDV infected calves was performed in one study [35] whereas BVDV challenge was administered by inoculation in other two studies [34], [36].

Good growth is even less likely with deletion mutant BRSV strains. An interesting approach to overcome poor and inconsistent yield of BRSV antigens has been to derive persistently infected BRSV bovine cell lines [37]. All cells in such cell lines are viable and express BRSV antigens upon routine subculture [37]. A further handicap in BRSV efficacy studies is the lack of a reliable and pathogenic challenge model for BRSV in cattle, and particularly in un-weaned calves with maternal antibodies [37].

This unusual approach gave disappointing results and protection against viraemia, leucopoenia and nasal shedding was partial along with a poor virus neutralising antibody response. A more direct vector approach [40] was that of expressing BVDV type 1 E2 glycoprotein in BHV-1 but to the best of our knowledge the recombinant has not been tested for efficacy.",

In the EU, legislation foresees the need for emergency vaccination. For this eventuality EU has FMDV antigen banks for all seven serotypes [4]. The policy of ring vaccination and culling contributed in FMD control in the Netherlands's 2001 outbreak. However, the development of serological tests to discriminate vaccinated from infected animals is considered desirable in emergency vaccination, the so-called DIVA principle (see below). In endemic areas, killed whole virus vaccines with different adjuvants in single or multi-serotype formulations are used in large quantities. Here it is important to highlight the difficulties in the immunoprophylaxis against FMD. Lack of cross-reactivity between the seven serotypes and the virus strain variation in each serotype pose major difficulty in diagnosis and control. This is further compounded by continued circulation (in endemic regions) of the virus, and high mutation rates (10\u22123 to 10\u22125 per nucleotide site) per genome replication add to the difficulty in vaccine-based control of disease in face of increasing globalisation [42], [43], [5].",

Also they do not elicit a quick onset and long lasting immunity. In general the onset of immunity is 3\u20134 weeks after primary vaccination. These difficulties aside, there is much effort, some based on viral vectors (Sendai virus, replication-defective adenovirus, Capri pox virus and vaccinia virus) to express VN epitopes of FMDV VP1 protein and/or peptides thereof, T cell epitopes on viral non-structural proteins and selected cytokine genes. Some adenovirus-FMDV and/or cytokine recombinants are promising vaccine candidates with respect of quicker onset and longer duration of immunity as well as fulfilling marker and DIVA vaccine criteria (see below). This work is ongoing [5], [44], [45]. Some of these vectors may be developed to deliver protective epitopes from antigens of other important disease causing viruses of ruminants in order to have multi-disease vaccine [5].",

ASFV is enzootic in most Sub-Saharan countries and has crossed the Atlantic Ocean and outbreaks were recorded in some South American countries and some Caribbean islands. In 1980s outbreaks ASF occurred in Europe (Iberian Peninsula, Sardinia and sporadically in France and Belgium). The European foci of ASFV infections were eradicated through slaughter policy. Infected pigs shed virus in all excretions and live virus spreads both horizontally and vertically and by bites of infected soft ticks (Ornithodorus moubata porcinous) [73] in which the virus replicates. Killed vaccines have failed to protect against the disease while live vaccines revert to virulence or fail to infect pigs. ASFV in Sub-Saharan Africa exists in the wild through a cycle of infection between soft ticks of genus Ornithodorous and wild swine (warthogs and bush pigs) which remain clinically normal. This virus epidemiology makes eradication difficult. The incursion by ASFV into Europe continues. Georgia recently (7th June 2007) officially reported ASF and the virus has rapidly spread throughout Georgia with high mortality in pig populations. Outbreaks of ASF have also occurred in nearby Armenia and recently also Russia has reported ASF.",

BTV is non-contagious and virus is transmitted biologically by approximately 30 species of biting midges of the genus Culicoides. In endemic areas different species of midges are involved in BTV transmission. BT was first described in South Africa and has since been recognised in most countries of the tropics and sub-tropics. In Europe, eight BTV serotypes have been identified in the Mediterranean basin. In Africa, the Middle East and Asia Culicoides imicola are important vectors of BTV transmission (accounting for at least 90% of disease transmission) while other midges (the Palaearctic endemic species of C. pulicaris and C. obsoletus) are important vectors in Northern Europe but other species of midges may also become important in BTV transmission in the future. The first reported incursion of BTV in Europe was between 1956 and 1960 to Portugal and Spain. Between 1998 and 2005, five BTV serotypes (BTV 1, BTV 2, BTV 4, BTV 9 and BTV 16) swept the Mediterranean basin and affected 15 countries. In 2006, BTV serotype 8 appeared in Northern Europe [89], [90]. All the ruminants including sheep, goats, cattle buffaloes, antelopes, deer and camels are susceptible to BTV infection. The virus has also been the cause of severe disease and deaths in white-tailed deer in the USA. However BT in sheep has its most significant clinical pathological and economic impact in temperate areas of the world. While infection of animals in tropical and sub-tropical countries is common, clinical disease in indigenous species is unusual. After infection via the saliva of a biting midge, virus undergoes primary replication in the regional lymph nodes from where virus is carried in blood leukocytes to target tissues for secondary replication and then results in pathology. In sheep common disease signs and lesions are fever, hyperaemia, cyanosis of the mouth and tongue, diarrhoea and mortality. In pregnant ewes, virus may cross the placenta and lead to foetal infection causing abortion, mummification or birth of stillborn or weak lambs [91]. BTV can cause some disease in cattle. In the current BTV-8 outbreak in Northern Europe, sporadic episodes of disease and deaths in a small proportion of infected cattle herds have been consistently recorded [Elbers ARW and others 2007].1\nIn cattle the clinical signs commonly observed have been crusty lesions of nasal mucous membrane, salivation, fever, hyperaemia and apathy. But significantly, cattle are important reservoir and virus amplifying hosts as midges feed more frequently on cattle. An important development in BTV epidemiology is the recent evidence for transplacental and contact transmission of BTV in cattle [92].",

Now, however, the emphasis is changing due to the high rise in HPAI and LPAI infections [98]. Like human influenza virus vaccines, AIV vaccines are grown in chicken eggs. For human influenza vaccines the process is greatly aided by the use of H1N1 human influenza A virus A/PR/8/34 (PR8) to produce high growth PR8-vaccine virus H and N (6 PR8 internal proteins and vaccine virus H and N glycoproteins) reassortants by the method of Kilbourne [100] and reverse genetics [101] to match the epidemiological field situation in the vaccine. For avian influenza H5, however, it has been shown in the field that classically grown, inactivated vaccines formulated with potent adjuvants can offer cross-protection against related pathogenic strains [102]. In the EU, H5 and H7 viruses are in the OIE list A and the outbreaks in poultry are notifiable [2], [3]. This is also the case in the rest of the world. Following a major outbreak of HPAI H7N1 virus in Italy in 1999\u20132000, a targeted preventive vaccination campaign using the differentiating between infected and vaccinated animals (DIVA) strategy was developed and applied in regions where LPAI viruses frequently occurred. This involved vaccination with an inactivated LPAI virus vaccine followed by regular serotyping of vaccinated birds in order to identify birds with antibodies to HPAI virus and thus onset of HPAI disease. Upon identification of HPAI virus infection, emergency eradication via culling is implemented. AIV vaccination may be taken up elsewhere. The USA currently considers vaccination as one option for its influenza management and India is considering its use. China is using AIV vaccines widely. Vaccination to control AIV disease is however not universally accepted.",

Respiratory disease is the main consequence in the field. The virus is readily attenuated by passage in eggs or tissue culture. Both live and killed vaccines are marketed but with variation in vaccination regimes. One regime for live TRTV vaccine use comprises spray vaccination of 1-day-old chicks and subsequent booster vaccination. Live vaccines do however commonly result in respiratory disease since vaccine virus is known to revert to virulence upon bird to bird passage. Hence further development of safer vaccines, without loss of efficacy may be warranted. The use of reverse genetics may be helpful in this respect.",

A limitation for such vaccines is that they are not recommended for use for diseases due to alpha viruses because of the risk of recombination between the alpha viruses. The usual vaccine construct involves foreign gene(s) in place of the alpha virus structural genes linked to alpha virus replicase and a strong heterologous promoter such as that from cytomegalovirus virus. Theoretically up to 200,000 copies can be produced in single cell within 4 h and expression of encoded antigen can be as much as 25% of the total cell protein [137].",

An acid-resistant hydrophobic matrix comprising the adjuvant saponin or its derivatives with antigen, cholesterol and phosphatidyl choline, commonly known as Iscoms (immuno-stimulating complexes), are immunogenic by the intramuscular as well as oral/nasal route and are potent T-helper cell (Th 1) adjuvants for enveloped viruses such as influenza virus [141], [13], [19]. In fact an Iscom equine influenza vaccine is available. An up-to-date account of the technology, ISCOMATRIX, in which better defined saponin fractions are used and in which the antigen is not present in the particle [19], is available in the context of equine influenza vaccine as well. Another idea is the use of polyester liquids, which form a gel in vivo after injection, as was the case with \u2018Atrigel\u2019, a drug delivery system used for pseudorabies virus vaccine in pigs [142].",

The latter is largely dictated by margins of profit, which are minimal especially in the poultry and swine industry.
