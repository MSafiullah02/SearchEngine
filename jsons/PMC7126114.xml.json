However, there is no reason to believe that biopower works in Taiwan the same way as it does in Europe where it originates. Therefore, the very means by which policy components assemble illustrate the local character of biopower, thereby shaping the conditions of life with which drug users in Taiwan have to cope.",

Deleuze and Guattari in A Thousand Plateaus (1987, p. 88) describe assemblages as aggregates of heterogeneous elements with aspects of \u201cmachinic\u201d content (bodies, actions, and passions) and \u201cenunciative\u201d expression (acts, statements, and incorporeal transformations attributed to the bodies). In addition, the boundaries of assemblages are always shifting, a process called deterritorialisation and reterritorialisation. The concept has been utilised in a number of studies on medical sociology and anthropology as well as science and technology studies (STS) to comprehend the amorphous and ephemeral aggregations involved in contemporary technoscientific projects that define public life.",

            "text": "Inspired by Keane's (2003) depiction of the practices and technologies of harm reduction policy as an assemblage, I further suggest that the office making this policy be seen as an assemblage as well. Keane's suggestion and mine echo the concept of ethno-epistemic assemblages described by sociologists Alan Irwin and Mike Michael (2003, p. 119), which refers to aggregates of people and truth claims situated in the contemporary decision making of public affairs. The \u201cethno\u201d part also addresses the locality and indexicality of the aggregates. Criticizing a citadel version of science-society relations where boundaries are demarcated, they address the rhizomic involvement of knowledge and publics in many, if not all, governmental decisions. Therefore, they suggest that the relationship of science, society, and governance be reconceptualised and even refashioned (Irwin & Michael, 2003). Although it has never been fully theorised and substantiated by empirical studies (except, perhaps, DeLanda's (2006) efforts), the concept of assemblages, with its variants and derivatives, can be seen in the study on the \u201cglobal assemblages\u201d of contemporary technologies and ethics (Ong and Collier, 2005, Ong, 2010) and also Greenhalgh's ethnographic work (2008, and also Greenhalgh & Winckler, 2005) that traces China's one-child policy assemblage. Greenhalgh's work can be seen as most exemplary of the complexity, dynamism, and contingency in policy-making. It demonstrates how these cybernetics-assisted population projections were constructed by various actors and entangled in ideologies, national desires for modernity, and trust in scientific truth claims.",

The two concepts, biopower and assemblages, do not appear as commensurate as they are heuristic, because they are both slippery and situated ideas. A preliminary attempt of combining governmentality and assemblages can be seen in the work of Irwin and Michael (2003). They comment on the ways in which biopower subjects and subjectivizes modern \u201cscientific\u201d citizens, who are concerned with questions of governmentality such as how \u201cthe way we think about exercising authority draws upon the theories, ideas, philosophies, and forms of knowledge that are part of our social and cultural products\u201d (Dean, 1999, p. 16, cited in Irwin & Michael, 2003, p. 130). However, by treating the ethno-epistemic assemblage as an instrument of biopower through which a \u201cscientific citizenship\u201d is constituted, they fail to show how the phenomena of assemblage making diversify the very notion of biopower.",

The manoeuvers of guanxi, as will be shown, reflect actors\u2019 connection-building efforts that establish and sustain, however temporarily, the policy assemblage. It enables the assemblage not on a foundation of rationality but on a thread of shared sentiment. Therefore, biopower does not only work through sentiments; it is also bred out of sentiments.",

They focus on the ways in which harm reduction was re-/presented by actors and these actors re-/presented themselves. Archival research refers to a detailed textual analysis of available literature in Taiwan, such as medical journals and daily newspapers. It aims to disclose and supplement the historical and discursive background from which harm reduction emerged. Interviews with people involved in policy making and implementation constituted the second part. Collected by snowball sampling, these in-depth interviews were the main source of information. For a qualitative research that focuses on interactions within and about policy-making, it is very difficult to collect real-time facts, because they are often invisible to the public (and also to the researcher). In relation to this, Wedel, Shore, Feldman, and Lathrop (2005, p. 41) contend that intensive interviewing is often \u201cthe only means of gathering first-hand information.\u201d In the present study, 32 people were interviewed, including bureaucrats, psychiatrists, HIV professionals (workers and researchers), pharmacists, and the like. Most interviews lasted one to two hours long, starting with questions that engaged the interviewees to tell their stories of participation in harm reduction. The interviews were transcribed verbatim, and the contents were taken as interpreted phenomena of the responders rather than as outright social facts. In addition to supplementing the interviews, the third part of the data came from field notes based on direct field observation, which was extended to places such as methadone clinics, needle-distributing pharmacies, and academic conferences. In these places, the author observed at close range both verbal and non-verbal performance between bureaucrats and specialists, or between drug users and their service providers.",

These collected data were, as Strauss (1987) suggests, serially coded (i.e., open, axial, and selective coding), analysed, and compared with existing data and frameworks. Unlike the objectivist version of grounded theory that tends to identify social facts or processes \u201cout there,\u201d this constructivist approach aims to include as many voices as possible and to see \u201cboth data and analysis as created from shared experiences and relationships with participants and other sources of data\u201d (Charmaz, 2006, p. 130). Therefore, the resulting data and analysis were treated as situated and relational. As Clarke (2005, p. 37) argues, \u201cIn simplified form, situational or relational ecology is closest to policy arena analysis.\u201d This pluralistic and interactional approach seems to capture without reification the various stakeholders, objects, practices, and discourses involved in the policy-making process.",

They are usually, but not always, located in the government. This term is adopted for good reasons. Previous literature on drug use concentrated mostly on the street life of drug users (Page & Singer, 2010), but this street-based approach failed to \u201cstudy up\u201d and expose how the policy was created and made drug users\u2019 lives marginalized and disenfranchised. The office is a conceptual tool that depicts the dynamism and changeability of policy-making. It refers to neither a circumscribed locality nor a well-defined group of human and nonhuman elements. As Nader (1972) contends, studying up and down would lead researchers to think anew by reversing many commonsensical questions, and not doing so may seriously impair further development in social theory and anthropological insight. Anthropological research on organisations and especially developmental projects has demonstrated the importance of \u201cstudying up,\u201d whose significance lies not only in the manners that development unfolds vis-\u00e0-vis local bureaucracies, institutions, and people (Mosse, 2005), but also in the ways that policies are rendered anti-political (Ferguson, 1990, Mitchell, 2002). These achievements have shown that a policy and its stakeholders can make good subjects for further ethnographic scrutiny. Thus, if researchers want to view drug problems in full light, it is important to look at what drug users are doing on the street (the \u201cstudying down\u201d method) and at how policymakers are picturing them whilst proposing administrative measures (the \u201cstudying up\u201d approach).",

As Mosse (2006) rightly argues, a researcher does not always enjoy leniency from research subjects in terms of collected data or analytical interpretations. Instead, he/she needs to know that the interpretations are themselves interventional because these give meanings to what the research subjects believe and practice in terms of policy projects. On this note, the futility of the insider/outsider dichotomy is all too obvious. Every policy ethnographer may find him/herself in a part-insider/part-outsider position (Mosse, 2005, p. 13). I knew this from the outset. It was not too difficult for me, a psychiatrist with some guanxi, to have access to addiction specialists and government officials. For example, right after the commencement of my field work, I was invited to contribute to a governmental policy plan on drug use. However, I sensed the unease as I went on, especially when I interviewed my previous colleagues and esteemed scholars from a standpoint that was supposed to be critical.

When the drug substitution programme was first organised, both methadone and Suboxone were proposed as suitable candidates. Methadone had a history of use for more than four decades and it was offered in syrup in Taiwan, whilst Suboxone, a sublingual tablet of two off-patent medications (buprenorphine and naloxone mixed in a specific ratio), was new in the market. Which medicine would be better for substitution treatment seemed to be a question on their properties, but \u201cbetter\u201d herein did not simply refer to their physiological, economic and normative properties. Instead, it referred to how these properties were seen by the participants as the performances of the two medications. In charge of all controlled substances, the National Bureau of Controlled Drugs favoured Suboxone because methadone, a Schedule Two Controlled Drug, was considered more addictive and thus more prohibitive than buprenorphine, a Schedule Three Drug. Furthermore, the pharmaceutical design of Suboxone made it even safer. Taken orally as indicated, buprenorphine may soothe craving without causing adverse effects of overdose. If drug users attempt to crush, dissolve and inject the medicine, the naloxone therein, an opioid antagonist absorbable only through the blood stream, can lead to severe withdrawal symptoms and discomfort, thus preventing further injection attempts. This combination did not only win Suboxone a patent but also inscribed a way of disciplining its users. Advocates of Suboxone believe that the risk of diversion-related overdose can be prevented.",

Since this policy was enacted by crisis and the funding was temporary, the CDC had to achieve success in the shortest time and at the lowest cost possible. As a result, it preferred methadone to Suboxone for two simple reasons. First, it costs less for both the user and the government. Suboxone could cost twenty times or more than methadone. Second, if any trouble took place during policy implementation, CDC would have some foreign experience for reference because it had been used elsewhere for decades. Besides, the half-life of syrup methadone would compel its users to return to distribution sites about every 24 h, making them visible for the sake of surveillance. Comparing Suboxone and methadone, an addiction specialist argued, \u201cPeople often spend lots of time and money every day getting to the hospital just for a sip [of methadone]. I think some people will want to shift to Suboxone even if it costs more, because time is money and they do not have to come to the hospital every day.\u201d His depiction implies a potential stratification phenomenon in which more affluent drug users may find Suboxone affordable but those who have limited means can only use the cheaper methadone. Whether this opinion will be confirmed or not, it is noteworthy that Suboxone and methadone would actualise different target populations even if these people were all too often categorised simply as \u201cinjection drug users\u201d (also see Fraser & Valentine, 2008 and Gomart, 2002a).",

            "text": "All these endeavours helped weave an interpersonal web of guanxi, which is of vital importance to our understanding of the office in this paper. Guanxi can be roughly translated into English as \u201cconnection\u201d or \u201crelationship.\u201d According to Yang (1994), it is widely, although often implicitly, recognised in Chinese societies, including China, Taiwan, and even Singapore; it usually refers to social bonds established through the exchange of gifts, favours, and banquets. A more defining feature of guanxi is the social relationship with both commitment and sentiment that goes beyond organisational barriers and, sometimes, even implies some kind of \u201cbackdoor politics\u201d (Langenberg, 2007). Noting that the art of guanxi, or guanxixue (), arose in the middle of the Cultural Revolution, Yang insightfully points out its root in ancient Chinese thoughts and conflicting roles in China's modernisation projects. Guanxi, she argues, is not an extension or manifestation of expanding state or official power. Instead, it constitutes a rhizomic form of power that \u201cexerts a subversive effect on the microtechniques of administrative power\u201d (Yang, 1994, p. 190). In her depiction (p. 295), guanxi was so culturally laden that it overshadowed \u201cthe two forms of full-fledged civil society: the individual and the association or group.\u201d It enacted a civil sphere, or minjian in Chinese, which was distinct from its counterpart in Euro-American contexts. However, I would like to push Yang's argument further. This is because I believe that guanxi does not only exist outside the political sphere represented by the CDC bureaucracy or the Executive Yuan; it is actually present inside as well and plays an enlivening part within such context. Minister Hou and some other main advocates of this policy thought that appealing to sentiments was necessary for a controversial policy like this. This is called bua ganjing () in Taiwanese, meaning the use of all efforts possible to win the approval and affection of someone else. Ganjing, or ganqing in Mandarin, literally means \u201cfeelings and affections.\u201d A major advocate of this policy, Yen Chun-Zuo, then Deputy Mayor of Tainan County, recounted his reaction when the proposal of harm reduction was softly put off by the Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan: \u201cI told him this would surely be a risky business. Even if a plan was made, it was never certain which local government would want to do it\u2026. But I told him I would definitely make this work. He was touched by me, so he told the Premiere.\u201d In the case of the office, it was ganjing, not bureaucratic rationality, which acted as a hinge upon which comradeship was built and agreement was reached. This constituted a unique way of making the office: Schoolmateship, sending gifts, and exchanges of various good-will contacts and promises all contributed to the making of a guanxi web that shaped the assemblage of the office. Although the building up of strong ties through this channel may \u201cbreed local cohesion\u201d at first but \u201clead to overall fragmentation\u201d in the long run (Granovetter, 1973, p. 1378), the significance of guanxi in circumventing the obstacles of inter-departmental communication in this case is beyond doubt.",

            "text": "That the office can be analytically treated as an assemblage is not something distinctly Taiwanese. In fact, the notion of the office is applicable elsewhere when the black box of policy-making is to be studied and opened up. As demonstrated by the case study in the current work, the office is characterised by its aptness to address multiple yet heterogeneous human and non-human actors (statistics and methadone in this case), especially the rhizomic and dynamic relationships amongst them. In this case, the constitutive elements have been illustrated to be linked by guanxi, which exerted instrumental functions but depended on emotional bonds. Although the overall effects might be abbreviated as biopower, the idea of the office as an assemblage compels readers to study up the messy aggregate of the power apparatus. The studying up approach does not usually agree with perspectives that treat policy-making as a staged process, in which multiple social organisations and political interest groups compete as policy windows open, nor does it agree with the perspectives that see a policy as marked by punctuation and equilibrium (Sabatier, 2007). Most notably, the approach does not limit itself to analysing domestic factors only; it is always transnational. The transnationality of this assemblage is illustrated on multiple levels. Not only is the pathogen that initiated the policy transnational\u2013\u2013the HIV strain is proven to originate in Southwestern China (Chen & Kuo, 2007), but the expertise and policy know-how are transnational as well, as shown above. Moreover, it shows from my interviews that immanent in the harm reduction policy is a desire for global recognition, because Taiwan has been excluded from international organisations such as WHO and the UNAIDS for decades. This approach, exemplified by this Taiwan case, echoes Ong and Collier's (2005) notion of global assemblages. It presents a picture distinct from Fraser and Valentine (2008) not just because of the fields researched (Taiwanese policy contributors vs. Australian methadone-distributing sites), but also due to the dimension of transnationality that is present in the former but comparatively absent in the latter. In short, this transnational dimension of the office argues against an implicit premise in most policy studies that situate policy processes within national borders.",

            "text": "This understanding is important because it is typical for a late advanced country such as Taiwan to make a policy this way when officials in charge feel compelled to pick up precedents, select and introduce expertise, and transplant relevant know-how due to the relative paucity of existing local research that argues for or against any given position. Policies thus made are invariably entangled with elements from other countries. The office, accommodating interpersonal guanxi as it constitutive skeleton, does not dismiss the intricacies of bureaucracy and knowledge or limit itself to domestic terrains. In summary, this current work demonstrates the potential of the office as an analytical concept. It addresses both local uniqueness and global connectedness. Studying up the office as an assemblage helps to theorise and propose a novel perspective on how policies are assembled and how biopower is manoeuvered. This analytical approach and the new focus are expected to help future researchers examine drug issues in a more comprehensive manner.",
