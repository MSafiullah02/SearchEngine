Objective: To determine the relationship of virus-specific wheezing illnesses and lung function in a longitudinal cohort of children at risk for asthma. Methods: Two hundred thirty-eight children were followed prospectively from birth to 8 years of age. Early life viral wheezing respiratory illnesses were assessed by using standard techniques, and lung function was assessed annually by using spirometry and impulse oscillometry. The relationships of these virus-specific wheezing illnesses and lung function were assessed by using mixed-effect linear regression. Results: Children with RV wheezing illness demonstrated significantly decreased spirometry values, FEV 1 (P 5 .001), FEV 0.5 (P < .001), FEF 25-75 (P < .001), and also had abnormal impulse oscillometry measures-more negative reactance at 5 Hz (P < .001)-compared with those who did not wheeze with RV. Children who wheezed with respiratory syncytial virus or other viral illnesses did not have any significant differences in spirometric or impulse oscillometry indices when compared with children who did not. Children diagnosed with asthma at ages 6 or 8 years had significantly decreased FEF 25-75 (P 5 .05) compared with children without asthma. Conclusion: Among outpatient viral wheezing illnesses in early childhood, those caused by RV infections are the most significant predictors of decreased lung function up to age 8 years in a high-risk birth cohort. Whether low lung function is a cause and/or effect of RV wheezing illnesses is yet to be determined. (J Allergy Clin Immunol 2011;128:532-8.)

These challenges relate to developmental maturation and coordination as only children at least 5 to 6 years of age can be expected to reliably perform reproducible forced respiratory maneuvers by spirometry. 7 In addition to spirometric evaluations, recent interest has focused on the use of impulse oscillometry (IOS). Given IOS's requirement for minimum cooperation, it is very suitable for use in young children. IOS has been used to measure the mechanical properties of the respiratory system in children with asthma 8, 9 and has been successfully used in children as young as 2 years. 10 During IOS, an external pressure impulse signal is applied during tidal breathing. From the resultant flow, the total respiratory impedance (Z rs ) and its components respiratory resistance (R rs ) and reactance (X rs ) are calculated at various frequencies. IOS may provide additional information than that obtained from spirometry, such as functional assessment of small peripheral airways, and thus has been proposed as a more sensitive measure of abnormal pulmonary processes and airway obstruction.

The association was best for the measures of FEV 0.5 and FEF 25-75 rather than FEV 1 .
