            "text": "Severe falciparum malaria is an acute systemic disease that can affect multiple organs, including those in which few parasites are found. The acute disease bears many similarities both clinically and, potentially, mechanistically, to the systemic diseases caused by bacteria, rickettsia, and viruses. Traditionally the morbidity and mortality associated with severe malarial disease has been explained in terms of mechanical obstruction to vascular flow by adherence to endothelium (termed sequestration) of erythrocytes containing mature-stage parasites. However, over the past few decades an alternative 'cytokine theory of disease' has also evolved, where malarial pathology is explained in terms of a balance between the pro-and anti-inflammatory cytokines. The final common pathway for this pro-inflammatory imbalance is believed to be a limitation in the supply and mitochondrial utilisation of energy to cells. Different patterns of ensuing energy depletion (both temporal and spatial) throughout the cells in the body present as different clinical syndromes. This chapter draws attention to the over-arching position that inflammatory cytokines are beginning to occupy in the pathogenesis of acute malaria and other acute infections. The influence of inflammatory cytokines on cellular function offers a molecular framework to explain the multiple clinical syndromes that are observed during acute malarial illness, and provides a fresh avenue of investigation for adjunct therapies to ameliorate the malarial disease process. * Childhood coma is defined by a Blantyre coma score 2. ** The childhood definition for severe anemia does not include a cut off for parasitaemia.

Falciparum malaria is responsible for considerable morbidity (300-500 million annual clinical cases) and death across the globe, with a particular burden of mortality among children in sub-Saharan Africa. Infection with P. vivax is rarely fatal, but is associated with considerable morbidity outside the African continent.

Why malarial disease displays such age-related differences in pathophysiology is unclear. However, these differences are not exclusive to malaria. ARDS, which is more frequently observed as a complication of trauma in adults compared with children [12] , is believed to reflect an exaggerated pro-inflammatory response within the lung [9] . A possible lead for future studies on these age-related differences in malaria is suggested by a report of peritoneal macrophages collected from healthy adults producing much less interleukin (IL)-10 (an anti-inflammatory cytokine), but the same levels of pro-inflammatory cytokine, than those from healthy children, giving adults a much higher pro-inflammatory status [13, 14] .",

By the start of the 20th century, two major theories, capillary blockage and toxicity of the parasites themselves, had been proposed to explain morbidity and mortality. Thus, the study of malarial disease is not a settled story requiring regular updates, but one containing, from its beginning, an unresolved tension. Vascular occlusion and malarial toxin (nowadays vascular occlusion and inflammatory cytokines) have been alternative approaches to understanding malarial disease as a whole, as well as the coma, for over a century, and the two have often been discussed side by side [5, 20, 21] . The presence of hyperlactataemia, hypoglycaemia, and metabolic acidosis, all three consistent with a patient being forced to rely on anaerobic glycolysis for energy production, have provided a consensus that hypoxia is central to disease pathogenesis in falciparum malaria. As sum-marised below, the modern literature offers two main theories for cellular hypoxia during infection; insufficient oxygen delivery to cells and impaired oxygen utilization within the cells. Both mechanisms may be governed by the host inflammatory cytokine response to infection. This chapter focuses on how an increased understanding of the molecular functions of cytokines during disease demonstrates a closer alignment between the pathogenesis of falciparum infection and other systemic infectious diseases.",

            "text": "One hundred and twenty years ago, Golgi (of the Golgi apparatus [22] ), noted onset of malarial fever and illness at a predictable short interval after the regular shower of new parasites were released from bursting red cells. The nature of the putative toxin so released was much discussed in the first decade of the 20th century [23] . It was assumed to be directly toxic, in the manner of tetanus toxin. The proposal that malarial products were not harmful in themselves, but only through causing the infected host to harm itself through generating toxic amounts of molecules (pro-inflammatory cytokines) that, in lower concentrations, inhibit growth of malarial parasites did not arise until 1981 [24] . Indeed, acceptance of the broad applicability of this concept to infectious disease in general is now sufficient for its evolution to be a subject for research [25] . Tumour necrosis factor (TNF) is regarded as a major player, malaria being the first disease in which it was proposed to cause systemic illness and pathology [24] . Multiple TNF promoter polymorphisms have since been independently associated with severe malaria across several geographical populations [26] . A longitudinal study in Burkino Faso has also demonstrated several TNF promoter polymorphisms associated with the regulation of host-parasite density [27] . The TNF concept has since begun to dominate the sepsis literature [28] , and the virulence of different strains of influenza, a disease that is a standard clinical misdiagnosis for imported malaria, has recently been expressed in terms of their capacity to induce TNF [29] . The critical role of TNF in both malaria and influenza pathogenesis is consistent with the clinical similarities between the diseases. Indeed, TNF infusions in tumour patients produce side effects mimicking both diseases [30] , as discussed below.",

            "text": "Once neutralising anti-TNF antibodies became available for human use, they were tested for efficacy against malarial disease. Unfortunately, a central tenet of the cytokine concept of infectious disease (that the proinflammatory cytokines that cause disease are the same mediators that, in lower concentrations, are responsible for the innate immunity that controls parasite growth) was not taken into consideration. TNF has been shown to inhibit a mouse malarial parasite in vivo [42] , and P. falciparum in vitro, provided white cells to generate the next down-stream mediator, possibly nitric oxide (NO) [43] , were present [44] . This is consistent with findings in human subjects [45] . Thus, it is not surprising that anti-TNF antibody, by removing inhibitory pressure from the pathogen, can enhance the disease in falciparum malaria [46] , as shown 5 years earlier in human sepsis [47] . Cytokines as a disease mechanism extends beyond malaria As noted above, the idea that excessive production of inflammatory cytokines underlies the pathology of illness is used widely, from malaria across a range of conditions, infectious or otherwise. As reviewed recently [48] , this now includes the illnesses caused by rickettsias, protozoa other than malaria, and viruses. Increased circulating levels of these cytokines have been detected in the serum very soon after onset of illness in virtually all those infectious diseases in which they have been sought. Some cytokine increased, and consequences are shown in Table 2 . When rTNF was under trial in volunteers as an anti-tumour agent [49, 50] nearly 20 years ago, virtually all of the symptoms and signs they share were reproduced as side effects. This includes headache, fever and rigours, nausea and vomiting, diarrhoea, anorexia, myalgia, thrombocytopaenia, immunosuppression, and central nervous system manifestations, all of which have been shown to be caused by a mechanism involving inflammatory cytokines. The rate, timing and intensity of cytokine release vary in different disease states, and provide them with somewhat individual clinical pictures, but the fundamentals remain. Nevertheless, the clinical patterns generated are remarkably close, in that, at least in some populations, clinical features cannot predict a diagnosis of malaria from other causes of fever [51] .",

            "text": "Mature erythrocytic forms of P. falciparum are not seen in peripheral blood smears, and cause the erythrocytes they inhabit to adhere to the walls of venules and capillaries. From this observation arose the widely held view that much of the pathology following malarial infection is explained through parasite sequestration causing impairment of microvascular flow. Sequestration certainly occurs, since the life cycle dictates this. However, whether the temporal and anatomical patterns of sequestration are the same in both individuals with fatal disease and in parasite tolerant individuals has not been ascertained. Consequently, whether sequestration is the principal instigator of local pathology, or whether sequestration is an associated feature of all malarial infections with local pathology determined by other factors in the host response to the infection, e.g. a local imbalance of inflammatory mediators, has not been fully elucidated. Erythrocyte cyto-adherence (irrespective of whether this adhesive process is directly or indirectly due to parasite sequestration) has repeatedly been shown to be mediated through a series of host-derived ligands. CD36 and thrombospondin were the first described endothelial receptors that bound infected red blood cells (RBCs) [52, 53] , with most studied wild parasite isolates demonstrating adhesion to CD36 [54] . More recently, it has been shown that P. falciparum also interacts with other host adhesion receptors, i.e. intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1 CD54), vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1 CD106) and E-selectin [55, 56] . Certain adhesive phenotypes, such as rosetting (the spontaneous tethering of infected and non-infected RBCs) and clumping (tethering of infected RBCs through platelets) have been preferentially associated with severe malarial disease [57, 58] . CD36 is involved in both mechanisms of adhesion, and a non-sense mutation in the gene encoding for CD36 has also been associated with protection from severe malaria [59] . Polymorphisms in the gene encoding ICAM-1 have also been associated with susceptibility to severe disease [27] . Furthermore, ICAM-1, together with VCAM and E-selectin, are up-regulated by TNF, with circulating levels of these ligands shown to be increased in severe malaria compared to uncomplicated infection [60] .",

There is some evidence to suggest that the propensity of inflammatory cytokines to up-regulate cell adhesion molecules, secondary to local variation in the density of thrombomodulin, is potentially higher in the microvasculature of the brain and placenta compared to other tissues. As reviewed [61] , TNF and IL-1 increase tissue factor expression on endothelial cells, thereby initiating pathways that generate thrombin [62] . When thrombin binds to thrombomodulin on the endothelial cell surface, protein C is activated, which in turn can lead to further downstream activation of the coagulation cascade. Therefore vasculature with lowest thrombomodulin densities on the endothelial cell surface (brain least, placenta next least, and other organs more [63] ) will have more unbound thrombin available for its other functions on activated endothelium. These other functions include up-regulation of adhesion molecules such as selectins, ICAM-1, VCAM-1 [64] and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) [65] . Therefore, up-regulation of adhesion molecules within the cerebral vessels may occur as a local endothelial response to systemic inflammation and may not necessarily be precipitated by parasite sequestration.",

The severe anaemia in transgenic mice expressing human TNF [68] incriminates the inflammatory response itself, so anaemia and mitochondrial dysfunction (see Mitochondrial dysfunction section below), both consequences of systemic inflammation, can be expected to coexist, and both contribute to total energy depletion.",

This prevents intracellular accumulation of osmotically active solutes, preventing a subsequent influx of water, cell swelling and loss of cell integrity. During human [69] and monkey [70] malaria infection, intracellular Na + accumulates within erythrocytes (both parasitised and non-parasitised) implying that this Na + /K + pump is impaired during the disease process. Parallel changes in the ionic content of erythrocytes have been documented in a sepsis model of infection [71] . Similarly, reduction in erythrocyte deformability was shown to be associated with increased NO, an inhibitor of this membrane pump [72] , in another sepsis model [73] . Since inhibition of the Na + /K + pump in vitro correlates with both reduced red cell deformability and decreased red cell filterability [74] , any factor that inhibits the Na + /K + pump could potentially worsen anaemia. Identification of inducible NO synthase (iNOS) activity, as one factor influencing red cell deformability, suggests that a pro-inflammatory milieu [75] may again govern the reduction in red cell deformability observed during malaria infection.",

Another inflammatory cytokine, macrophage inhibitory factor (MIF) that is increased in malaria, and induced by TNF, has been shown to cause dyserythropoiesis in in vitro studies on bone marrow cells [95, 96] . Thus, inflammatory cytokines generated during malaria are a major determinant of the degree to which anaemia influences the amount of oxygen that reaches tissues in malaria.",

Cellular respiration requires oxygen and pyruvate, as well as multiple cofactors and active transport molecules. Within the matrix of the mitochondrion organelle, pyruvate is catabolised via the Krebs cycle and oxidative phosphorylation (involving NADH and FADH2) to generate ATP. When this series of reactions are 100% efficient (unlikely in vivo), 1 molecule of glucose generates 2 molecules of pyruvate, which are further catabolised to water and carbon dioxide with the concomitant generation of 36 molecules of ATP. In comparison, during anaerobic glucose catabolism, pyruvate is converted to lactate with the concomitant generation of 2 molecules of ATP, a process that also facilitates regeneration of NADH and FADH2.",

Awareness of this mechanism began with oxygen tension being shown to be increased in septic rats [98] and patients [99] . A cytokine model of mitochondrial dysfunction has since been developed in which impairment of cellular respiration occurs following induction of sepsis (or exposure to pro-inflammatory cytokines), despite sufficient oxygen supply [97, 100, 101] . More recently, impairment of enzyme activity associated with the mitochondrial complexes has been demonstrated in muscle biopsies retrieved from rodent models of sepsis [102] and septic patients [103, 104] . The observation that the inflammatory cytokines implicated in mitochondrial shutdown are prominent in both sepsis and malaria [105, 106] supports such organelle dysfunction being equally plausible in malaria.",

It is not unique to this disease, being seen in viral, rickettsial and bacterial infections [113] as well as acute gastroenteritis, where its prevalence is higher than in malaria [114] . The terms hyperlactataemia and lactic acidosis are often mistakenly used interchangeably in the malaria literature. As often reviewed in the basic literature [115] [116] [117] [118] , protons (H + , the basis of acidosis) are not formed when ATP and lactate are generated during glycolysis, but on the subsequent hydrolysis of ATP in tissues. Every time a molecule of ATP undergoes hydrolysis, a proton is released. If this occurs under aero-bic conditions, these protons are consumed within ATP regeneration from ADP, and pH remains normal, i.e. acidosis does not occur. In contrast, if the mitochondria are not functioning adequately, whether through insufficient oxygen supply or an inability to use it, ATP regenerates under anaerobic condition, and the protons are not consumed. Hence, once the buffering capacity of the body is exceeded, acidosis occurs. In short, metabolic acidosis requires the ratio of glycolytic (i.e. anaerobic) ATP hydrolysis to mitochondrial (i.e. aerobic) ATP hydrolysis to reach a point at which the buffering systems can no longer cope. Pathological changes in the buffering system can be a major determinant of when this occurs.",

For some time hyperlactataemia has been regarded as a functionally relevant marker for a poor prognosis in both sepsis [119] and malaria [66, 112, 120] . Although the sepsis world now discusses several origins for the lactate increase, including inflammation-induced mitochondrial dysfunction [97] , in falciparum malaria it is still generally attributed to a reduced oxygen supply, mostly through microvascular occlusion by sequestered parasitised erythrocytes [121] . Other mechanisms are known to contribute to acidosis in malaria, independent of lactate production, e.g. acute renal failure [8] . Impaired hepatic clearance [8, 112] , production by parasites, and, in some areas, thiamine deficiency [122] are also argued to contribute to lactate accumulation independent of impaired cellular respiration. Thus, as described below, although acidosis and hyperlactataemia can be associated, they are independent cellular mechanisms.",

A recent editorial in Critical Care Medicine [124] has lucidly summarised the key points of the mechanism of metabolic acidosis in sepsis, a condition that shares systemic inflammation and a range of its consequences with severe malaria (Tab. 2). These authors argue against lactate as the cause of the acidosis associated with hypoxia. Instead, they note the evidence that during hypoxia, be it from limited oxygen supply or utilisation, the unconsumed protons that cause acidosis arise from the hydrolysis of non-mitochondrial ATP. Since these reactions are independent of lactate levels, it is difficult to see how therapeutically reducing levels of this anion, as has been proposed [125] , could increase survival rate in falciparum malaria any more than in sepsis [126] . Indeed, in theory it could harm comatose patients, since there is evidence that lactate helps brain tissue survive hypoxic and hypoglycaemic episodes [127] [128] [129] , and the lactate shuttle is proving to be how astrocytes protect neurons from metabolic stress [130] .",

Thus, cytotoxic oedema can occur secondary to an imbalance in supply and demand of energy within the cells. Several mechanisms, such as sustained increase in neuronal activation, impaired substrate delivery (structural and functional) and impaired mitochondrial utilisation of available substrates, including oxygen, may coexist to generate this imbalance.

In the past, a common premise was that parasite sequestration precipitated cerebral vaso-occlusive/ischaemic (i.e. stroke-like) events that manifested clinically as CM. However, CM demonstrates several features that are atypical for stroke. In children, focal neurological signs do not tend to accompany coma, although a sub-set of patients do exhibit hemiparesis or focal brainstem deficits during the agonal period [148] . The incidence of residual neurological deficits following recovery from coma is relatively low (11% [147] ) when compared to childhood stroke (93% had residual neurological deficit [149] ). Where computer tomography has been performed in children, diffuse brain swelling was observed [150] rather than focal lesions more typical of stroke. Although retinal haemorrhages have been observed in 46% of Malawian children with CM (and in 63% of patients who died), these lesions were also seen in 30% of children with SMA in the same study [140] . Consequently, although associated with CM, retinal haemorrhages do not confirm that focal cerebral vaso-occlusive/ischaemic events underlie CM. Similarly, histological examination of 32 fatal CM cases of African children at autopsy demonstrated that one third had little or no evidence of local vascular change in the brain, as indicated by sequestered parasites, monocyte clusters, micro-haemorrhages, local vascular iNOS [151] or haemoxygenase -1 (HO-1) [152] staining. Accepting that CM may occur without ischaemia does not exclude temporary or less severe reductions in vessel flow occurring during acute CM (associated or independent of parasite sequestration) that may contribute to impaired substrate delivery and lead to energy imbalance.",

Within the simplified model of dissociated neuronal culture, mitochondria appear to play a critical role in neuronal homeostasis during excitotoxin exposure. Mitochondria are not only involved with maintaining ATP production but also calcium homeostasis, and generation and detoxification of reactive oxygen species [107] . Excitotoxin production may also be influenced by cytokine release. TNF administration has been shown to alter brain metabolism of tryptophan to produce more kynurinine [159, 160] . Thus, as part of a general inflammatory reaction, increased excitotoxin generation during acute malaria may contribute to cellular energy imbalance. Elevated levels of neuronal excitotoxins (quinolinic and picolinic acid) in the CSF have been associated with a fatal outcome in Malawian children with CM [161] . Similarly, a graded increment of quinolinic acid concentration in CSF was observed across patient outcome groups of increasing severity in African children [162] .",

Two such studies report adults exhibiting severe malaria with P. vivax (but not P. falciparum) infection detectable on PCR and serological and testing [142, 143] .

It is characterised by a diffuse disturbance of cerebral function (typically impairment of consciousness) that occurs in the context of systemic response to infection without direct neuroinvasion (i.e. meningitis, macroscopic cerebritis and brain abscesses are excluded). SAE is associated with generalised slow waves on the electroencephalogram (EEG), with the depth of coma linked with mortality. Mild SAE cases often recover completely, while survivors of severe SAE may have persistent neurological deficit [165] ). In line with adult CM, the severity of encephalopathy parallels the severity of systemic organ failure [141] . Inflammatory cytokines have been demonstrated to be higher in the serum than in the CSF, suggesting that sepsis encephalopathy is a consequence of the systemic inflammatory response to infection [141] . An animal model in which prior administration of a neutralising antibody to TNF prevented the sepsis encephalopathy of pancreatitis [166] is consistent with this. Further postulated reversible mechanisms of pathogenesis include changes in regional cerebral blood flow, neurotransmitter imbalance, mitochondrial dysfunction, BBB impairment and oxidative stress [167] .",

The coinciding geographic distributions of malaria transmission and the thalassaemias prompted Haldane to put forward the 'malaria hypothesis', which proposed that common erythrocyte abnormalities are selected because of the fitness advantage they confer against malaria [177] . Sickle cell haemoglobin (HbS) has also been repeatedly shown to be associated with malaria resistance, with heterozygotes for the HbS trait demonstrating 10% of the population at risk for severe malaria in certain populations [178] . Other haemoglobinopathies (e.g. HbC [179, 180] and HbE [181] ) and deficiencies in RBC enzymes (e.g. glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency [182] ) have also been linked with protection against severe malaria. The mechanisms of protection afforded by haemoglobinopathies are likely to be multi-factorial. Studies have demonstrated evidence to support several independent mechanisms including: reduced parasite invasion of RBCs and diminished intraerythrocytic growth of parasites in patients with the HbS trait [183] , enhanced phagocytosis of parasite-infected erythrocytes (IEs) [184] and enhanced immune responses against IEs [185] .",

PfEMP1 has been implicated in numerous IE adhesive interactions. In the latter study the authors demonstrated that HbC reduces the level of IE adhesion to endothelial monolayers, in addition to IE rosetting (the adhesion of IEs to uninfected erythrocytes) and IE agglutination by sera. These findings provide the prospect that HbC pro-tects against severe malaria by mitigating the obstruction and inflammation caused by the PfEMP1-mediated adherence of IEs [186] . However, sequestration is believed to enhance parasite survival by enabling IEs to avoid splenic clearance, so any reduction of sequestration by HbC can be expected to limit parasite fitness. Multiple epidemiology studies (e.g. [179, 187, 188] ) have failed to identify any significant impact of HbC on the frequency or density of parasitaemia in naturally exposed populations. Consequently, the influence of the changes in IE surface conformation needs to be confirmed and further examined in vivo [189] .",
