The cases had been reported since December 8, 2019, and many patients worked at or lived around the local Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market although other early cases had no exposure to this market [1]. On January 7, a novel coronavirus, originally abbreviated as 2019-nCoV by WHO, was identified from the throat swab sample of a patient [2]. This pathogen was later renamed as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) by the Coronavirus Study Group [3] and the disease was named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by the WHO. As of January 30, 7736 confirmed and 12,167 suspected cases had been reported in China and 82 confirmed cases had been detected in 18 other countries [4]. In the same day, WHO declared the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) [4].",

Using the genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2, RaTG13, and SARS-CoV [11], a further study found that the virus is more related to BatCoV RaTG13, a bat coronavirus that was previously detected in Rhinolophus affinis from Yunnan Province, with 96.2% overall genome sequence identity [11]. A study found that no evidence of recombination events detected in the genome of SARS-CoV-2 from other viruses originating from bats such as BatCoV RaTG13, SARS-CoV and SARSr-CoVs [11]. Altogether, these findings suggest that bats might be the original host of this virus [10], [11].",

Nevertheless, bats do not always need an intermediary host to transmit viruses to humans. For example, Nipah virus in Bangladesh is transmitted through bats shedding into raw date palm sap [12].",

However, a genomic study has provided evidence that the virus was introduced from another, yet unknown location, into the market where it spread more rapidly, although human-to-human transmission may have occurred earlier [14]. Clusters of infected family members and medical workers have confirmed the presence of person-to-person transmission [15]. After January 1, less than 10% of patients had market exposure and more than 70% patients had no exposure to the market [13]. Person-to-person transmission is thought to occur among close contacts mainly via respiratory droplets produced when an infected person coughs or sneezes. Fomites may be a large source of transmission, as SARS-CoV has been found to persist on surfaces up to 96 h [16] and other coronaviruses for up to 9 days [17].",

A striking example of the adaptability of these viruses is the emergence of deadly zoonotic diseases in human history caused by SARS-CoV [36] and MERS-CoV [37]. In both viruses, bats served as the natural reservoir and humans were the terminal host, with the palm civet and dromedary camel the intermediary host for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, respectively [38], [39]. Intermediate hosts clearly play a critical role in cross species transmission as they can facilitate increased contact between a virus and a new host and enable further adaptation necessary for an effective replication in the new host [40]. Because of the pandemic potential of SARS-CoV-2, careful surveillance is immensely important to monitor its future host adaptation, viral evolution, infectivity, transmissibility, and pathogenicity.",

The envelope spike (S) protein receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2 was shown structurally similar to that of SARS-CoV, despite amino acid variation at some key residues [10]. Further extensive structural analysis strongly suggests that SARS-CoV-2 may use host receptor angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) to enter the cells [41], the same receptor facilitating SARS-CoV to infect the airway epithelium and alveolar type 2 (AT2) pneumocytes, pulmonary cells that synthesize pulmonary surfactant [42]. In general, the spike protein of coronavirus is divided into the S1 and S2 domain, in which S1 is responsible for receptor binding and S2 domain is responsible for cell membrane fusion [10]. The S1 domain of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 share around 50 conserved amino acids, whereas most of the bat-derived viruses showed more variation [10]. In addition, identification of several key residues (Gln493 and Asn501) that govern the binding of SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain with ACE2 further support that SARS-CoV-2 has acquired capacity for person-to-person transmission [41]. Although, the spike protein sequence of receptor binding SARS-CoV-2 is more similar to that of SARS-CoV, at the whole genome level SARS-CoV-2 is more closely related to bat-SL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21 [10].",

Immediately after binding to their receptive receptor, SARS-CoV-2 enters host cells where they encounter the innate immune response. In order to productively infect the new host, SARS-CoV-2 must be able to inhibit or evade host innate immune signalling. However, it is largely unknown how SARS-CoV-2 manages to evade immune response and drive pathogenesis. Given that COVID-19 and SARS have similar clinical features [7], SARS-CoV-2 may have a similar pathogenesis mechanism as SARS-CoV. In response to SARS-CoV infections, the type I interferon (IFN) system induces the expression of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) to inhibit viral replication. To overcome this antiviral activity, SARS-CoV encodes at least 8 viral antagonists that modulate induction of IFN and cytokines and evade ISG effector function [43].",

Some patients progressed rapidly with Acute Respiratory Stress Syndrome (ARDS) and septic shock, which was eventually followed by multiple organ failure and about 10% of patients have died [8]. ARDS progression and extensive lung damage in COVID-19 are further indications that ACE2 might be a route of entry for the SARS-CoV-2 as ACE2 is known abundantly present on ciliated cells of the airway epithelium and alveolar type II (cells (pulmonary cells that synthesize pulmonary surfactant) in humans [44].",

In serum from patients diagnosed with SARS, there is increased levels of proinflammatory cytokines (e.g. interleukin (IL)-1, IL6, IL12, interferon gamma (IFN\u03b3), IFN-\u03b3-induced protein 10 (IP10), macrophage inflammatory proteins 1A (MIP1A) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP1)), which are associated with pulmonary inflammation and severe lung damage [45]. Likewise, patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 are reported to have higher plasma levels of proinflammatory cytokines including IL1\u03b2, IL-2, IL7, TNF-\u03b1, GSCF, MCP1 than healthy adults [7]. Importantly, patients in the intensive care unit (ICU) have a significantly higher level of GSCF, IP10, MCP1, and TNF-\u03b1 than those non-ICU patients, suggesting that a cytokine storm might be an underlying cause of disease severity [7]. Unexpectedly, anti-inflammatory cytokines such as IL10 and IL4 were also increased in those patients [7], which was uncommon phenomenon for an acute phase viral infection. Another interesting finding, as explained before, was that SARS-CoV-2 has shown to preferentially infect older adult males with rare cases reported in children [7], [8]. The same trend was observed in primate models of SARS-CoV where the virus was found more likely to infect aged Cynomolgus macaque than young adults [46]. Further studies are necessary to identify the virulence factors and the host genes of SARS-CoV-2 that allows the virus to cross the species-specific barrier and cause lethal disease in humans.",

Remdesivir which was developed for Ebola virus, has been used to treat imported COVID-19 cases in US [61]. A brief report of treatment combination of Lopinavir/Ritonavir, Arbidol, and Shufeng Jiedu Capsule (SFJDC), a traditional Chinese medicine, showed a clinical benefit to three of four COVID-19 patients [62]. There is an ongoing clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of lopinavir-ritonavir and interferon-\u03b1 2b in patients with COVID-19 [55]. Ramsedivir, a broad spectrum antivirus has demonstrated in vitro and in vivo efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 and has also initiated its clinical trial [63], [64]. In addition, other potential drugs from existing antiviral agent have also been proposed [65], [66].",

They should not be permitted to wait with other patients seeking medical care at the facilities. They should be placed in a separated, fully ventilated room and approximately 2 m away from other patients with convenient access to respiratory hygiene supplies [69]. In addition, if a confirmed COVID-19 case require hospitalization, they must be placed in a single patient room with negative air pressure \u2013 a minimum of six air changes per hour. Exhausted air has to be filtered through high efficiency particulate air (HEPA) and medical personnel entering the room should wear personal protective equipment (PPE) such as gloves, gown, disposable N95, and eye protection. Once the cases are recovered and discharged, the room should be decontaminated or disinfected and personnel entering the room need to wear PPE particularly facemask, gown, eye protection [69].",

Also, as there are still conflicting assumptions regarding the animal origins of the virus (i.e. some studies linked the virus to bat [71], [72] while others associated the virus with snake [73]), contacts with these animal fluids or tissues or consumption of wild caught animal meet should be avoided. Moreover, educating the public to recognize unusual symptoms such as chronic cough or shortness of breath is essential therefore that they could seek medical care for early detection of the virus. If large-scale community transmission occurs, mitigating social gatherings, temporary school closure, home isolation, close monitoring of symptomatic individual, provision of life supports (e.g. oxygen supply, mechanical ventilator), personal hand hygiene, and wearing personal protective equipment such as facemask should also be enforced [74].",
