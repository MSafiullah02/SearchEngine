Our model enables a tractable quantitative analysis of the optimal policy for the control of the epidemic dynamics using both lockdown and detection intervention levers. With parametric specification based on literature on COVID-19, we investigate the sensitivities of various quantities on the optimal strategies, taking into account the subtle trade-off between the sanitary and the socio-economic cost of the pandemic, together with the limited capacity level of ICU. We identify the optimal lockdown policy as an intervention structured in 4 successive phases: First a quick and strong lockdown intervention to stop the exponential growth of the contagion; second a short transition phase to reduce the prevalence of the virus; third a long period with full ICU capacity and stable virus prevalence; finally a return to normal social interactions with disappearance of the virus. The optimal scenario hereby avoids the second wave of infection, provided the lockdown is released sufficiently slowly. We also provide optimal intervention measures with increasing ICU capacity, as well as optimization over the effort on detection of infectious and immune individuals. Whenever massive resources are introduced to detect infected individuals, the pressure on social distancing can be released, whereas the impact of detection of immune individuals reveals to be more moderate.",

More specifically, the COVID-19 turned out to be much more contagious than expected, and official health authorities understood that letting the virus spread freely would probably saturate hospital capacities. In most countries, aggressive quarantine and lockdown measures have been taken, hopefully to stop the spread of the virus and infection, or at least to slow down its diffusion and delay the cases over time to avoid saturation of healthcare systems. The effectiveness of these non-pharmaceutical interventions have been questioned in ; . It was already suggested in Qualls et al. (2017) , but then emphasized by Ferguson et al. (2020) , that these measures should rather aim at 'flattening the curve': mitigation seems more realistic than suppression, since eliminating the threat necessarily takes time, and a massive arrival of people in need in hospitals would be dramatic.",

            "text": "In the recent literature on the COVID-19, many papers have focused on the effect of lockdown on the spread of the disease (e.g. Berger et al. (2020) ; Roques et al. (2020) ) or on the evaluation via simulations of exit-strategies (e.g. Domenico et al. (2020) ; Evgeniou et al. (2020) ). In this paper, we suggest a different approach for evaluating lockdown and exit scenarios based on Optimal Control theory (e.g. Pontryagin et al. (1964) ). Although the analysis of public health policies using controls is of clear practical value, there has not been a so dense literature on the subject (e.g. Abakuks (1973 Abakuks ( , 1974 ; Behncke (2000) ; Greenhalg (1988) ; Hansen and Day (2011) ; Agusto and Adekunle (2014) ; Sharomi and Malik (2017) ). We consider a modified SI R model, incorporating all the features related to the recent COVID-19 outbreak mentioned above, and use optimization algorithms to compute the 'best' level of lockdown and detection effort in testing individuals. The criterion to rank the different possible strategies takes into account: 1) the death toll of the epidemic, 2) the economic and social costs of the lockdown, 3) the required effort for detecting infected or immune individuals. Besides, we only consider strategies never exceeding the capacity level U max of the ICU sanitary system, chosen to be dedicated to COVID-19 patients. One of the originality of the model considered here is the particular focus on the outcomes of the intensive care units (ICU) saturation, which in many countries have been put under great pressure and whose capacities are determining factors for the death toll of the disease. We assume a capacity constraints on how many individuals can be treated in ICU at a given time. Once the threshold is reached, the fatality rate for the additional patients sent to ICU rises sharply. For the COVID-19 outbreak, we are aware of some works by Alvarez et al. (2020) ; Djidjou-Demasse et al. (2020) ; Piguillem and Shi (2020) , but none of these work models the ICU capacities. In Acemoglu et al. (2020) , no ICU capacity is explicitly introduced, but these authors choose a death rate in hospitals that depends linearly on the number of patients. The non-linearity induced by the threshold that we introduce provides very interesting phenomena and insights for the control of the disease. Furthermore, we investigate cases where the ICU capacity is increasing and evolving dynamically over time. A second feature in our work is that we consider two levers for control: the quarantine ratio and the detection effort for infectious and immune individuals. One of our motivation is to study qualitatively the balance existing between efficient testing and strong confinement strategies. Actually, two testing procedures can be performed here. A short range one, that can detect, at time t if someone is infected, or not (Polymerase chain reaction or PCR tests, that can detect whether an individual is infected and send her/him in quarantine). And a long range one, that can detect if someone is immune or not (a blood test as in Huang et al. (2020) ). For this purpose, we introduced a so-called SI DUHR +/\u2212 propagation model for the epidemic, which explicitly allows to take into account the detection ratios of immune and infected individuals.",

First, a strong and quick lockdown intervention allows to stop the exponential growth of the epidemic spreading and bring the effective reproduction number R t under level 1. Then begins a short transition period during which R t remains below 1 as the prevalence of the virus within the population diminishes progressively until reaching a threshold I * . Since the beginning of the epidemic, the number of individuals requiring ICU is rising and just reaches U max when the virus prevalence attains I * . Then begins a very long period during which the reproduction number R t stabilizes at level 1 while the virus prevalence and the ICU occupation remain stable at levels I * and U max . Finally, when a sufficient proportion of the population has already been infected and the herd immunity level is close enough, a light final release of lockdown measure allows to retrieve a regular level of social interactions and end the epidemic phase. Such a control strategy allows to achieve an epidemic size very close to the herd immunity level, which corresponds to the minimal size of an epidemic, in comparison to a benchmark case without intervention for example. Besides, given the current level of information and confidence on the COVID-19 dynamics modelling, the design of robust optimal control strategy should be seen as a minimal requirement. For our model, the enhanced structure of the optimally controlled epidemic dynamics reveals to be very robust to variations of the model specifications within a reasonable range.",

Detecting quickly infected individuals and breaking the contamination chains reveals to be key in reducing the economic and sanitary burden of the epidemic. First, it allows to slow down the exponential growth of the epidemic and decrease hereby the required epidemic size for reaching the herd immunity and the induced death toll. It also reduces the lockdown effort on the population, which helps minimize the socio-economic impact. Optimizing over the detection rate of infected individuals reveals the huge impact on both sanitary and economic burdens of early effort in detection, as well as a stable threshold level in detection. Using the detection of infectious individuals as a control lever allows to keep the reproduction number below 1 while limiting the lockdown effort and the induced socio-economic cost. Concerning the detection of immune individuals, it allows to reduce significantly the socio-economic burden, later in time during the epidemic, whereas its impact on the sanitary outcome seems rather limited.",

In section 3.3, we provide a sensitivity analysis, and discuss the robustness of our findings in response to changes in the model specifications and parameters. In sections 3.4 and 3.5, we consider the impact of two other controls: the ICU sustainability level and detection resources. Given the simplicity of the compartmental model considered here, our purpose is not to give detailed prediction of the epidemic but rather to highlight very interesting aspects of the interplay between different levers (lockdown, detection and ICU capacity), provide qualitative description of the outcomes in each scenarios and give rough estimates of the duration and size of the epidemics.",

The population, of fixed size, is divided into three categories: susceptible (S), infected (I) and recovered (R) individuals. We denote by S t , I t and R t the respective proportions in the populations at time t (measured in days).

The infection rate \u03b2 is reduced by a time-dependent factor (1 \u2212 \u03b4) where \u03b4 \u2208 [0, 1] comes from social distancing, quarantine, isolation interventions that reduce infectious contact rates. The strength of the lockdown intervention interprets as follows: \u03b4 = 0 means no intervention while \u03b4 = 1 means no social interaction. We consider two ways of detecting individuals: short range tests allow to discover new infectious individuals in I \u2212 and we denote by \u03bb 1 the rate at which each of these infectious individuals gets detected, long range test allow to find formerly infected and hereby immune individuals that are now in R \u2212 and we denote by \u03bb 2 the corresponding rate. Here we are interested in the case where the parameters \u03b4 and \u03bb 1 are control variables and in the sequel, these parameters are hereby time dependent. The recovery rate for an infected individual is \u03b3 I R . The rate at which an infected individual enters the health system is \u03b3 I H . We assume here that both rates \u03b3 I R and \u03b3 I H are the same for detected or non-detected infected individuals. The individual transition rates from H to U or R + , from U to R + or to D are denoted by \u03b3 HU , \u03b3 H R , \u03b3 U R (U) and \u03b3 U D (U) respectively. Notice that the two later rates \u03b3 U R (U) and \u03b3 U D (U) are not constant but depend on U t : when the ICU limitation is reached, the extra patients who are not taken in charge by the system can not recover and are exposed to extra death rates, as explained in the Appendix A. These parameters are chosen following the tracks of Domenico et al. (2020) ; Salje et al. (2020) . In these papers, some parameters are fixed according to clinical studies and other are estimated from French data. The detail on how these parameters are computed in the present paper is given in Section A. However, we emphasize that although we choose French benchmarks, our input is more on methodology and can be of interest for other countries or epidemics as well.",

When R t < 1, the average number of secondary cases started from one primary case with symptom onset on day t, dies out quickly, resulting in a decay in the number of infected individuals in the population. But when R t > 1, the infected population grows over time. So we should expect to have controls on the quarantine level \u03b4 t and on the testing rate \u03bb t that will constrain R t to be reduced beyond 1, at least after some starting time. Another information brought by the R t < 1 is that, when S is smaller than the so-called 'herd immunity' threshold, the epidemic enters into a sub-critical phase where it goes to extinction. In our case, the herd immunity threshold S * without intervention is around 30% and durable lockdown and detection efforts can allow to reduce it significantly until the arrival of a vaccination solution.",

Quarantine is a rather old technique used to prevent the spread of diseases. It refers to the restriction of movement of anyone (not necessarily sick people), and it usually takes place at home, and may be applied at the individual level. It should be distinguished from isolation, which refers to the restriction of movement of infectious individuals who have a contagious disease. It can be done in hospitals, in dedicated facilities, or at home. Those two are seen as active controls, and are different from contact surveillance, which is passive. Modern quarantine's goal is to reduce transmission by increasing social distance between people, by reducing the number of people with whom everyone can be in contact with. This includes canceling public gatherings, closing public transportation, etc. A lockdown is intended to stop people from moving between places, and it could involve cancelling flights, closing borders, and shutting down restaurants. The idea is to reduce the flow of people to curb transmission, and we might consider here that lockdown and quarantine measures are almost equivalent. Sethi (1978) suggested an optimal quarantine problem, in an SI R model, where a proportion of infected people could be quarantined. He proved that the optimal strategy was either to quarantine all infected individuals (if so, at early stages) or none. In the context of the 2003 SARS pandemic in Singapore, Ooi et al. (2005) recall that a Home Quarantine Order was signed, but it was more an isolation of sick people than a lockdown as the ones used to lower possible consequences of COVID-19. But options considered are different, from one country to another. Wong et al. (2020) mentions that several countries closesd their borders, in most European countries, schools and restaurants were closed for weeks. Lagorio et al. (2011) tried to quantify the effectiveness of a quarantine strategy, where healthy people are advised to avoid contacts with individuals that might carry the disease, using network based models. Here, the parameter has a direct interpretation, since it is related to the average rate of contact between individuals. In Yan and Zou (2008) or Ku et al. (2020) , quarantine and isolation are used as control. In our model, those controls correspond to the \u03b4 t component. As in Chinazzi et al. (2020) , such control can also be related to travel bans, for a weaker form than strict quarantine. Note finally that Alvarez et al. (2020) suggested that a complete lockdown was impossible to reach, and that an upper bound of 70% (of the population) should be considered. In this paper, we do not incorporate any constraint (except that we cannot lockdown more than the entire population), but interestingly, in the numerical simulation, the upper bound we obtained as optimal is very close to this value.",

Together with proper detection means, the use of this test corresponds to the \u03bb 1 t control in our dynamics. This test allows to detect and isolate infectious individuals.

Nevertheless, Oliver (2013) legitimates the use of an appropriate discounting of health outcomes. About the kind of discount we should use, van der Pol and Cairns (2002) discusses the use of hyperbolic discount (opposed to classical exponential discount), in the case of social choice regarding health outcome. The hyperbolic discount allows for asymmetry in discounting, and non-stationarity, in the sense that postponing in two years now can be substantially different from postponing in three years (from now) next year. On the other hand, van der Pol and Cairns (2002) claims that is not necessarily a realistic assumption, so that using a standard time-consistant exponential discount makes sense in terms of health outcomes. Besides, the longer we can postpone deaths, the more likely a vaccine will be found before. Adding up a exponential discounting factor reveals to be also perfectly consistent with the consideration of random development time of a vaccine solution at large scale, with exponential distribution. Hence, we will consider a sanitary cost of the form:",

More involved modelling may wish to take into account a feedback effect between labor and consumption levels together with the epidemic propagation characterized by the global rate of social interactions within the population. Such approach goes beyond the scope of this paper and we solely intend to quantify the impact of the epidemic prevalence in terms of reduction of social interactions. Here, we would like to capture the loss of productivity and well-being among the population due to lockdown situation. In a very general setting, the production function is a function of capital input (K, that usually corresponds to machinery, equipment, buildings, etc.) and labor (W, that represents the total number of people working): the output produced in a given period of time is classically given by a Cobb-Douglas production function function (as introduced in Cobb and Douglas (1928)) K 1\u2212a W a , with a \u2208 (0, 1). Power coefficients identify to the output elasticities. Here, the function display constant returns to scale, in the sense that doubling the use of capital K and labor W will also double produced output. Assuming that, on the short term (say less than a year) capital remains constant, it means that if at time t, only a proportion W t of individuals can be economically active, the productivity loss is proportional to 1 \u2212 W a t . Thus, the inter-temporal economic cost at time t is proportional to (1 \u2212 W a t ), or (up to an additive constant) \u2212W a t . Nevertheless, several other metrics have been used on the literature in order to account for the economic cost induced by the lockdown situation: Guerrieri et al. (2020) or Eichenbaum et al.

The World Health Organization recommends a combination of measures: rapid diagnosis and immediate isolation of cases, rigorous tracking and precautionary self-isolation of close contacts. Cohen and Kupferschmidt (2020) compares various techniques used to detect infected people. Recall that we assume that a virologic testing is performed for all individuals entering into the hospital. Besides, proper tracing of contamination chains together with potential random screening of the population should be conducted on the non detected individuals, i.e. on the sub-population Q t . This group contains the susceptible S t , the undetected infected I \u2212 t as well as the undetected immune R \u2212 t . As antibodies detection should also be performed on the same group Q t , it seems important to take into account the impact of the size of this group within the population.

Nevertheless, we did not yet take into account the risks and outcomes induced by the saturation of ICU hospital care facilities. The dynamics of the SI DUHR +/\u2212 model already takes into account the strong impact of ICU saturation on the mortality rate on individuals with severe symptoms. Whenever the proportion of individual in U exceeds the upper bound level U max , patients can not be treated correctly so that patients are more likely to transfer to D instead of R + , in comparison to calmer times where U < U max . With such feature, the optimal lockdown and detection strategies should undoubtedly try to limit the duration of periods where the maximal ICU capacity is exceeded. Nevertheless, as we believe that exceeding capacities of ICUs would have a strong negative impact on the hospital staff and even the entire population, we rather choose to impose the non-saturation of ICU as a required state constraint on the system.

Besides, whenever the level of infected is small enough, SI R type dynamics are not fully reliable anymore, limiting the impact of such approximation on the derived optimal strategy. In practice, the numerical experiments are indeed not sensitive to the choice of maturity T, as soon as it is picked large enough. For the graphs shown here, we used T = 700 days (almost two years), corresponding to a scenario where a vaccination solution is available within 2 years. We did run computations up to T = 900 looking for a potential impact on the interpretation of the optimal strategy. But since we did not observe relevant ones, we restricted our attention to T = 700 in order to simplify the overall presentation of the results. Besides, in order to encompass the state constraint into the maximum principle based algorithm, we simply represent it under the form of a penalization cost, whenever the ICU constraint is not satisfied.

Starting from an initial guess, at each iteration the approximation for the optimal control is updated based on the expression of the gradient in terms of the solution to a forward-backward system of ordinary differential equations. In order to ensure that the controls remain between 0 and 1, a projection of the new controls on the interval [0, 1] is performed at each iteration. Let us first investigate the outcomes of the epidemic dynamics when no lockdown, detection nor quarantine policies are available. As commonly done in the current literature, we do not take into account the reaction of individuals in response to the virus prevalence dynamics, as discussed e.g. in Elie et al. (2020) . Anticipating realistic individuals behaviors in such context is still difficult, as no available data allows to tackle this phenomenon properly. We suppose that the virus dynamics has no impact on the level of social interactions of individuals,which remains constant equal to \u03b2 0 .

Quick activation of a strong lockdown: The optimal strategy consists in activating as soon as possible a strong lockdown measure on the entire population as no targeting or detection is considered or possible at that stage. This strategy has been widely used in March and April 2020 as half of the world population was under lockdown. With our parameters, the contact rate over the population is reduced by 80% over a couple of days, in order to stop immediately the exponential growth of infected and infectious individuals. Hereby, the size of the epidemic peak is highly reduced and, after less than one month, only 2% of the population is contaminated at the peak of the epidemic (instead of 34% in the no-intervention benchmark case). Of course, at the exact same date, the effective reproduction number R t goes below 1. During this initial short period, the effort in economic activity reduction has been very important: the welfare level W went down by 80%, while at the same time the occupation rate in ICU hospital care system has been constantly rising.",

During this period, the proportion of infectious individuals decreases strongly in order reach an optimal prevalence level I * in the population, required for the very long next phase. The optimal structure in four steps for controlling the pandemic dynamics is quite robust and very natural. It is worth observing that although the dynamic reproduction number is not part of the criterion of interest, reaching its optimal trajectory with four successive patterns is key for controlling the dynamic level of admissions in ICU. Using the optimal control policy, the infections by the virus in the population have been spread out over 500 days, providing a sustainable level of admissions in ICU for the sanitary system. In comparison to the nointervention benchmark case, the death toll has been divided by almost 100, thanks to a strong reduction in the level of social interactions.

In the optimally controlled scenario, we can clearly identify the 4 phases described above: I is still rising during the first phase until reaching a small epidemic peak level, it starts decreasing during the second transition phase until reaching the optimal level I * corresponding to the level U max of ICU capacity.

The global patterns in the epidemic dynamics remain globally similar. A larger sanitary weight induces a smaller death toll, a smaller epidemic peak together with a shorter ICU saturation period. The economic gain or loss seems to be mostly sensible during the second half of the epidemic duration. Figure 9 provides the shapes of numerically approximated optimal epidemic curves for different beliefs about the expected arrival time of a vaccine (and a cure). In comparison to the benchmark case where no vaccine potential creation is taken into account, the arrival date \u03c4 of the vaccine is supposed to follow an exponential distribution with expectation 100, 250 or 500 days, while the optimization is occurring on the time interval [0, T \u2227 \u03c4] . The epidemic curves are very similar when the anticipated time for vaccine availability is long enough, confirming the robustness of the approach and main findings. Whenever a vaccination procedure is supposed to arise rather early, the optimal strategy consists in postponing the mortality while keeping a stronger and longer lockdown effort, hoping for a quick vaccination solution. The sanitary burden is hereby smaller during the early stage of the epidemics but rises more strongly at the terminal phase.",

An important motivation was to avoid that hospital systems get overwhelmed, and more specifically, social distancing was introduced to ensure that the occupation of ICUs with ventilators remain within the capacities of hospitals, dedicated to COVID-19 patients. Previously, we integrated an upper limit to ICU -denoted by U max -and in this section, we discuss the impact of a potential increase of that capacity. Of course, increasing capacity does not simply mean getting more masks, beds, ventilators, or medicines for the serious cases. It also means diverting resources, training more staff to work in the ICU, and probably introduce telemedicine solutions for non-COVID-19 patients (who do not require hospitalization) to free up beds.",

We can imagine an increase in the number of ventilators or back-ups with staff coming from other regions that are spared by the epidemics, as was done in China or France for instance. Another possible interpretation is that the medical staff on the front line might be infected in early periods leading to an initial shortage of personal at the beginning followed by a return to normal within a few weeks. Here, we consider a regular (linear) increase of ICU capacities over two months, until reaching a new limit, 50% higher than the original one. This scenario has a major impact on all quantities. First, we observe that the derived optimal lockdown strategy is able to let the ICU admission level bind the sustainable constraint over time, although it now grows dynamically with time. This corresponds to a longer second phase duration until the stable in prevalence and ICU capacity starts. The final number of dead people is overall smaller than in the original scenario, as the expansion of ICU capacity allows to treat more patients simultaneously. Therefore, the social distancing can be much weaker during the long ICU saturation phase, which also happens to be way shorter. Furthermore, ICU saturation duration is much shorter with a major positive impact on the economy from day 100 until day 400, as the lockdown intervention remains much weaker (after 200 days, the global level of social interactions is around 65% in comparison to less than 50% in our benchmark scenario). This reduces the socio-economic impact of the epidemic and hereby allows to reach a smaller mortality count at time T. The overall gain at terminal date is massive (even if here, we do not include a cost for increasing capacities). Nevertheless, the augmentation of ICU capacity implies also a higher daily dynamic death toll, so that an early non-anticipated vaccination solution at an intermediate date would induce a higher sanitary cost in comparison to the scenario without ICU capacity rising. Figure 5 : Evolution of states with optimal control \u03b4 when 'raising the line' (increase of U max by 50%). The plain line is the benchmark scenario discussed in Section 3.2; the dashed line corresponds to the scenario with a capacity of U max which increases linearly from time t = 0 until t = 60 days up to 1.5 times the initial capacity and then stays at this level.",

For instance we observe a smaller death toll, a weaker economic impact as well as less ICU saturation. Up to remaining numerical errors, moving the detection capacity \u03bb 1 from 1% to 10% has a strong impact on the overall outcomes of the epidemic: The epidemic size drops from 70% to 30%, the remaining number of susceptible individuals S T 70% corresponds to the herd immunity obtained with \u03bb 1 = 0.1 and \u03b4 0.25, the duration of ICU capacity saturation is divided by a factor larger than 2, and the overall sanitary and economic costs are divided by 2. The huge detection of infected individuals has a strong impact on the socio-economic cost for two reasons: First, detection of infected individuals allows to slow down the epidemic propagation. Second, detected infected individuals are later on identified as immune people, i.e. are in compartment R + , so that they are not impacted by social relations limitation, which reduces the overall economic cost. Finally, observe that massive testing has a major impact on most output (and must be massive to really impact, as suggested in Peto (2020) ). Observe that S T remains rather large, but hopefully any epidemic restart is avoided by the detection effort \u03bb 1 which must not be released (the patterns of some figures close to terminal date T are due to the numerical approximation of the infinite horizon problem by a finite one).",

This confirms the intuition that intense detection resources are required from the beginning of the epidemic. More specifically, we now focus on the optimal dispatch over time of allocation resources: Figure 12 provides the optimal policy for the detection of infected whenever no lockdown measures are in place, while Figure 13 provides the optimal combination of detection policy and lockdown intervention. For both cases, the weight w prevalence has been set up equal to 1. As we can observe on both Figure 12 and Figure 13 , and as stated clearly in Peto (2020) , massive testing and detection strategies could have been used to end the epidemic rapidly. The optimal strategy consists in having extremely massive and early type-1 detection resources, in order to isolate infected individuals and break the contamination chains. Herd immunity is ensured while we keep the detection active so that R t remains below 1, allowing to epidemic size to remain very small, while everyone simply waits for for a vaccination cure.",

Then, in the other scenarios, optimization is done on both lockdown and detection capacity of infected and immune individuals. The notion of 'best scenario' is of course very much impacted by the choice of objective function that is made. The optimization takes into account the trade-off between lowering the number of deaths and minimizing the economic and social costs. To our knowledge, taking into consideration these diverse aspects into the objective function has not been studied much in the recent literature (see e.g. Acemoglu et al.

It is really this constraint that shapes the decisions leading to a curve that is 'flattened' sufficiently to ensure the sustainability of the health system. This is particularly visible in the scenario where U max is increased of 50% within 2 months at the beginning of the epidemic: we see a relaxation of the lockdown that is permitted by the increased capacity of ICUs.",

Without being an explicit target in the control problem, the evolution of the effective reproduction number R t is extremely interesting, and consistent with existing epidemiological literature. Again, without monitoring that indicator, we obtain in all the optimal strategies, R t becomes controlled below 1 after a few days (after the phase 1, and at the price of an important initial lockdown), and remains just below that critical value2.

Such analysis calls for the use of differential quarantine strategies based on an estimation of the own risk of each individual. In our approach we use immunity detection procedure for a similar purpose, but less accurate estimates of the risk of each individuals are also available depending on their current and past health characteristics. As discussed in Evgeniou et al. (2020) , the key ingredient for considering and using a differential lockdown strategy is a proper handling of the risk of bad specification of the group associated to some individuals. A dynamic optimisation over both the dynamic lockdown intervention together with the risk level associated to each misspecification is left for further research. Similarly the risk of wrong identification of infected or immune individuals using parameters \u03bb 1 and \u03bb 2 should be also taken into account in the design of a proper and efficient detection strategy. Also, in view of more practical applications for health policy guidance, a vector based version of SI DUHR +/\u2212 should probably be derived, as in Acemoglu et al. (2020) for instance. Categories can be splited depending on the age of individuals. Hence, S t will then be (S c t , S a t , S s t ), with children, adults and seniors, for instance. Most of the equations of the dynamics become multivariate, and parameters will be vectors, except \u03b2 that becomes a WAIFW (or Who Acquires Infection From Whom) matrix, as in Wallinga et al. (2006) or Mossong et al. (2008) . The main interest would be to have target and age-specific controls, with testing and lockdown that can be per age group. The difficult component in this multivariate extension is on the objective function, where the economic component should probably be more related to well-being cost of being quarantined, especially for people who do not belong to labor groups.",

For this, we choose our parameters on the basis of the works by Domenico et al. (2020) ; Salje et al. (2020) for the French COVID-19 epidemics. We emphasize that despite of this choice, the methodology developed here is general and can apply to any country of disease. The line (a) in the Table 3 can be obtained as follows: the model of Domenico et al. (2020) for Ile-de-France is structured into 3 age-classes: children (25%), adults (60%) and seniors (15%).",

The proximity between both optimal control problems is well established in the literature, see e.g. Section 4.1 in Elie (2008) , while we observe empirically very few impact by the choice of maturity T, as soon as T is chosen large enough in order for the epidemic phase to be over (i.e. such that the proportion of infected people is small enough at time T). With respect to the random time of vaccination \u03c4, such approximation corresponds to optimizing over the timeSimilarly, the problem (12) is an optimal control problem with sate constraint on the ICU capacity, and we choose to replace for ease of numerical tractability the state constraint by a penalization cost with a sufficiently large weight w ICU > 0. Hence, we focus numerically on an approximate version of the original optimal control, which is given by:where the approximate objective functionJ T is given b\u1ef9",
