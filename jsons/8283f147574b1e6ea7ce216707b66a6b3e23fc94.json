            "text": "Varicella-zoster virus (VZV) induces chickenpox (varicella), shingles (herpes zoster), and/or postherpetic neuralgia. Varicella is the primary VZV infection and it occurs most frequently in children. Herpes zoster occurs mainly in adults or immunocompromised hosts as a consequence of latent VZV reactivation. 1 VZV is a member of the human herpesvirus family encoding five major glycoproteins designated gpI-gpV. 2 Glycoproteins are critical factors for VZV entry and replication. Thus, they are attractive targets for antiviral drug development. 3 VZV gE among VZV glycoproteins is the most abundant and immunogenic. It participates in viral replication and cell-cell transmission. Moreover, it contains B-cell and CD4 + T-cell epitopes and elicits complementdependent neutralizing antibodies and cell-mediated immunity. 4 VZV-specific CD4 + T cells synthesize Th1-like cytokines such as interleukin-2 (IL-2) and interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3). They induce major histocompatibility complex class II-restricted cytotoxicity. 5, 6 Therefore, CD4 + T cells expressing IL-2 and IFN-\u03b3 were selected as immune markers to evaluate cell-mediated immune responses to VZV vaccines. 4,7-9 VZV gE is an attractive candidate for the development of VZV subunit vaccines because the VZV gE antigen, also known as CD4 + T-cell antigen, is capable of inducing both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. [10] [11] [12] [13] Vaccines currently used to prevent VZV include live attenuated vaccine (LAV) developed by Takahashi and colleagues in 1974 14 and several other varicella vaccines licensed in several countries. The herpes zoster LAVs, Zostavax (Merck & Co., Inc., Darmstadt, Germany) and SKYZoster (SK Bioscience Co Ltd, Andong, Korea), have been licensed. LAV has preventive efficacy against varicella in the range of 70% to 96%. In contrast, its preventive efficacy against herpes zoster is only~60%. 15 LAV promotes relatively lower VZV-specific cellular immune responses against herpes zoster in older patients as immunosenescence accompanies the aging process. Immunosenescence is characterized by decreased T-cell numbers and impaired T-cell function. 16 A subunit vaccine comprising VZV gE and the liposome-based adjuvant Shingrix (GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals, Rixensart, Belgium) was licensed in 2017. Its reported efficacy against herpes zoster was 97%. 15 Therefore, the subunit vaccine may have greater efficacy against herpes zoster than LAV. A recombinant subunit vaccine is a potential alternative to live attenuated herpes zoster vaccine. However, the low immunogenicity of individual viral proteins may have to be enhanced with adjuvants. 17 Adjuvants are immunomodulating substances that may be combined in formulations to increase their immunostimulatory efficacy. 18 Certain adjuvants have been approved for clinical use. All new adjuvants should be compared with the gold-standard aluminum-based adjuvants (alum). Alum has been used to increase vaccine formulation efficacy for >90 years. 19 However, there are still limitations of alum that require supplementation to boost vaccine efficacy. For example, alum typically induces a Th2 response, which mediates the differentiation of B cells that secrete Th2-cellassociated antibody isotypes, as opposed to inducing a very low Th1 response that is required to activate innate immune response, 20,21 as a prerequisite to guarantee a more effective and/or long-term immune response. 22 The ideal adjuvant induces innate immune responses, thereby activating adaptive immune responses. 23, 24 Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists and oil-in-water emulsions have been developed to complement alum adjuvants. 25, 26 Our new candidate adjuvant is a single-strand RNA (ssRNA) derived from the cricket paralysis virus (CrPV) intergenic region (IGR) of the internal ribosome entry site (IRES). It induces balanced Th1/Th2 responses, enhances innate immune response, and increases vaccine efficacy. 27 Here, we modified this novel ssRNA adjuvant to encode the VZV gE gene. The latter was then tested in a gE subunit vaccine expressed in a Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell culture platform and LAV bearing the Oka/SK strain. In VZV-primed mice, we assessed whether this ssRNA adjuvant induces humoral-and cell-mediated immunity in the VZV gE subunit vaccine. Adjuvants are not usually included in LAV formulations. However, we used guinea pigs to evaluate the ability of the ssRNA adjuvant to enhance neutralizing antibody production and cell-mediated immune response in VZV LAV. Based on all results, we showed the potential of ssRNA adjuvants to compensate for the limitations of protein-based vaccines with respect to low T-cell activity and short-term responses, as well as to increase the neutralizing antibody in LAV for preventing VZV-induced disease.",

Gene cloning for the gE antigen was performed with a primer and a vector (pBudCE4.1) ( Table 1 ) after isolating the DNA from Oka/SK WVSS (working virus seed stock). The VZV gE antigen was expressed in a CHO-K1 (ATCC CCL-61) cell line via a CHO transfection kit including Lipofectamine LTX-Plus (No. 15338-100; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Single-cell colonies were obtained according to gE expression in isolated single cells. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) identified four stable cell clone candidates with high antigen expression that were adapted in serum-free media. After 50 serial passages, only one clone 15 was selected. Cells with confirmed gE antigen expression were cultured to 8 L. The antigen was purified via serial ultrafiltration/diafiltration (UF/DF) steps and anion exchange chromatography and concentrated to 30 kDa for immunization. UF/DF was performed on a 10-kDa Pellicon membrane (No. P2B010A01; Pellicon 2 Mini ultrafiltration module Biomax; EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA).
