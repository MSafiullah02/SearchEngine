            "text": "Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a severe lung inflammatory disorder commonly characterized by infection or injury inducing the development of diffuse alveolar damage that results in severe hypoxemia. It remains a lethal or disabling medical condition. In intensive care unit (ICU), the incident rate of patients attributed to ARDS is high. The mortality rate of patients with severe ARDS is nearly 50% as estimated [1]. Even though patients who recover from this disorder are still at high risk for depression, cognitive decline, and persistent skeletal muscle weakness and post-traumatic stress disorder. Risk factors for ARDS include factors that lead to direct or indirect lung injury. For instance, pulmonary contusion, inhalation injury, pneumonia, aspiration of gastric contents and drowning are the common direct lung-injury factors, while pancreatitis, sepsis, major burn injury, drug overdose, transfusion of blood products and cardiopulmonary bypass can indirectly cause lung injury that leads to ARDS. Based on the recent clinical findings, more than 85% of ARDS cases are attributed to sepsis, pneumonia and aspiration of gastric contents [2].",

The prominent innate cell type activated at this early stage is resident alveolar macrophages that subsequently secrete proinflammatory cytokines or chemokines to promote the activation of alveolar epithelial and endothelial cells and recruitments of monocytes and neutrophils. The subsequent activation of alveolar epithelial and endothelial cells contributes to the damage of barrier function and the accumulation of edema fluid flooding in injured lung tissue. The local accumulation of monocytes and neutrophils produces more inflammatory mediators and results in prolonged tissue damages. Uncontrolled ARDS leads to increased mortality [3].",

LPS was administrated intratracheally to induce acute lung injury. 24 h later, the lung tissues were harvested and processed for microarray analysis of miRNA gene expression. A list of miRNAs showing most significant changes is shown in Fig. 1a. Among those, miR-802 was one of the most significantly downregulated targets in ARDS lung tissue. The role of this candidate in ARDS or other lung injury has not been reported, which made it a novel miRNA in ARDS field. To explore its function in ARDS, we subsequently isolated alveolar macrophages from lungs by bronchoalveolar lavage. The primary macrophages were cultured and challenged with LPS. We found LPS stimulation reduced the expression of miR-802 to almost fourfold (Fig. 1b). This was consistent with the in vivo result. We also confirmed the LPS-mediated suppression of miR-802 in RAW264.7, an immortalized monocyte/macrophage line (Fig. 1c). Interestingly, when we challenged A549, an alveolar basal epithelial cell line, no miR-802 reduction was detected (Fig. 1d). Therefore, miR-802 in lung tissue was suppressed by LPS and the reduction was largely attributed to the response in macrophages.",

Macrophages are a key cell type in lung in response to LPS challenge and proinflammatory cytokine production is a critical step that mediates LPS-induced tissue damage. Since miR-802 was found reduced by LPS in alveolar macrophages, we restored the miRNA expression in the cells and examines its impact on proinflammatory response induced by LPS. As shown (Fig. 2a), macrophages challenged with LPS produced high level of TNF\u03b1, while overexpressing miR-802 before LPS stimulation greatly suppressed the TNF\u03b1 expression. We observed similar suppressing effects of miR-802 in LPS-mediated interleukin-1 beta (IL-1\u03b2) and IL-6 induction (Fig. 2b, c). Therefore, we concluded miR-802 expression may antagonize proinflammatory cytokine production during LPS-mediated lung inflammatory response and tissue damage. Independently prolonged LPS challenge could induce cell apoptosis. As shown (Fig. 2d), LPS increased cell death rate in macrophages as measured by TUNEL assay. However, miR-802 expression did not change the LPS effect on cell apoptosis. Therefore, the regulatory function of miR-802 may be specific to inflammatory pathway.",

First, we analyzed the morphological change of lung tissues with H&E staining. As shown (Fig. 3a), sepsis group showed increasing neutrophil infiltration, alveolar hemorrhage, lung edema, and compromised epithelial/endothelial cell structure compared with the sham group. Interestingly pre-treatment of miR-802 significantly reduced tissue damage and led to a significant improvement on lung morphology. Second, we determined the neutrophils activation by measuring myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity in lung tissues. As shown (Fig. 3b), MPO activity increased greatly in LPS-challenged lung tissues and the delivery of miR-802 reduced the increased MPO activity in damaged lung. LPS challenge also increased the permeability of the lung tissues as measured by Evan\u2019s blue staining (Fig. 3c). In miR-802-treated group, the LPS-mediated protein leakage in lung tissues was significantly improved (Fig. 3c). Last but not least, since the suppression effect of miR-802 in inflammatory cytokine production was found in vitro, we proceeded the measure level in the lung tissues. As expected, LPS administration caused a significant induction of TNF\u03b1 in the damaged tissues and overexpressing miR-802 markedly antagonized the accumulation of the proinflammatory factor (Fig. 3d).

Among them Peli2 carried a miR-802 target site in its 3\u2019UTR, which was conserved in both mouse and human (Fig. 4a). Peli2 is an E3 ligase that mediates the inflammatory response in response to LPS [14]. We hypothesized that miR-802 may target Peli2 to suppress LPS challenge. Therefore, we constructed luciferase reporter gene (denoted as WT), in which Peli2 3\u2019UTR containing the miRNA target site was cloned to the downstream of the coding sequence. As comparison, we constructed the MUT vector in which the miRNA target site in Peli2 3\u2019UTR was mutated (Fig. 4a). To access the binding, we co-transfected the WT vector with either miR-802 or scramble control. As shown (Fig. 4b), miR-802 but not scramble miRNA markedly reduced the luciferase activity. In contrast, co-transfection of miR-802 with the MUT vector did not impact on the luciferase activity (Fig. 4b). To confirm the direct regulation of miR-802 on Peli2, we expressed either the miRNA or the scramble control in alveolar macrophages and then measured Peli2 protein level. As shown (Fig. 4c), overexpression of miR-802 markedly decreased the protein expression of Peli2. Functionally Peli2 controls the activation NLRP3 inflammasome by promoting its ubiquitination in response to LPS [15]. Thus, we proceeded to measure the effect of miR-802 in NLRP3 activation by LPS. As shown (Fig. 4d), LPS stimulation promoted the accumulation of K63-linked ubiquitinated NLRP3, which was an indicator of NLRP3 activation. Interestingly, overexpressing miR-802 abrogated the ubiquitination on NLRP3, which may be attributed to the downregulation of Peli2 by the miRNA. Taken together, we identified Peli2 was a direct downstream target of miR-802 in lung macrophages.",

We treated primary macrophages with specific inhibitors targeting these downstream factors, including BMS345541, a selective inhibitor of I\u03baB kinase to block NF\u03baB activation, SB203580 and SP600125 that directly target p38 and JNK, respectively. After 24 h, we challenged the cells with LPS and measured the effect on miR802 suppression. As shown in Fig. 6a, only BMS345541 but not the other two inhibitors could disrupt the suppression effect on the miRNA. To confirm this, we also repeated the same treatment on RAW264.7. Consistently only NF\u0199B could specifically abolish LPS-mediated miR802 reduction (Fig. 6b). Taken together LPS-induced miR802 suppression was NF\u0199B pathway dependent (Fig. 6c).",

At the top of the list, miR-802, miR-520, miR-5121, miR-155, miR-300, and miR-96 are found significantly downregulated in the disease model. The upregulated candidates are miR-199a and miR-200b. In this study, we have elucidated the role of miR-802 in ARDS. Specifically, the miRNA downregulation has been confirmed in LPS-challenged lung macrophages but not epithelial cells. Restoring the miRNA expressing level in LPS-challenged macrophages can reduce the overproduction of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6. However, the overexpression of miR-802 cannot inhibit the cell death challenged by LPS, suggesting the regulation of miR-802 in macrophages may be specific to proinflammatory pathway. The benefits of overexpressing miR-802 in ARDS can be extended to the in vivo model. We have observed the alleviation in neutrophil activation, tissue permeability and proinflammatory cytokine secretion in addition to the clinical improvements by histological analysis. In the same study, we have identified Peli2, a positive regulator in LPS/TLR4 pathway, as downstream target of miR-802 in macrophages. Overexpressing miR-802 can repress Peli2 expression and NLRP3 ubiquitination. Interestingly, Peli2 expression has been found upregulated in ARDS model that inversely correlates with the miR-802 expression. More importantly, co-expression of Peli2 in miR-802-transfected macrophages can abolish the antagonizing effect of the miRNA in proinflammatory pathway. Last but not least, inhibiting NF\u03baB activation but not p38 or JNK phosphorylation specifically abolishes LPS-mediated repression of miR802 expression. Therefore, our study has shown strong evidence to support the involvement of miR-802/Peli2 signalling axis in ARDS (Fig. 6c).",

            "text": "Acute respiratory distress syndrome as a severe form of lung injury is commonly found in critically ill patients. Lack of effective therapeutic targets for ARDS leads to the high mortality rate of ARDS patients. MiRNAs are emerging as promising drug targets for many diseases. They can regulate the singling proteins post-transcriptionally to control the disease progression. In ARDS, modified expression of miRNAs has been studied to develop the diagnosis and treatment for the diseases [17, 18]. Microarray-based miRNA profiling has been employed to study the modified miRNA expression in rat ARDS model [8]. Many miRNAs involved in the pathogenesis of ARDS regulate either tissue repair or inflammatory response in lung tissue. In LPS-induced ARDS model, miR-233 has been found downregulated with a similar trend as miR-802 in our study. Overexpressing miR-233 can attenuate LPS-mediated inflammation in the disease model. Interestingly, miR-233 has been also found to inhibit NLRP3 inflammasome by targeting rho-related GTP-binding protein RhoB (RHOB) [19]. In another study, miR-155 has been reported being elevated in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples of ARDS patients. In this case, the elevation of the miRNA is likely an adaptive mechanism to the stress. In the animal experiment, the overexpression of miR-155 alleviates septic lung injury by targeting transforming growth factor-\u03b2-activated binding protein 2 (TAB2), a regulatory molecule under TLR4 signalling [20]. In another similar study, miR-146a has been characterized as a suppressor in LPS-induced acute lung injury [21]. The upregulation of miR-146a inhibits the inflammatory responses by suppressing the expression of TRAF-6 and IRAK-1. Interestingly, IRAK1 is acting upstream of Peli2 under TLR4 activation. The activation of Peli2 by IRAK1 enhances its E3 ligase activity. The activated Peli2 mediates the ubiquitination and activation of NLRP3 inflammasome [15, 22]. There are increasing evidences from ARDS animal models supporting this signalling axis can be regulated by multiple miRNAs including miR-802 from our study. These studies indicate TLR4 signalling be critical for the initiation and development of acute lung injury and the signalling components in the pathway carrying the therapeutic potential for managing ARDS.",

            "text": "miR-802 has been studied intensively in cancer biology. Generally, it has been proposed as a tumor suppressor. For instance, in cervical cancer, miR-802 was downregulated and the restoration of the miRNA inhibits serine-/arginine-rich splicing factor9 (SRSF9) to induce cancer cell apoptosis [23]. The enforced expression of miR-802 can antagonize gastric cancer oncogenesis by inhibiting RAB23 expression [24]. Similarly, miR-802 can also act as a tumor suppressor against tongue squamous cell carcinoma growth and metastasis [25]. In tongue squamous cells, miR-802 directly regulates the expression of MAP2K4. In addition, miR-802 has been demonstrated in human prostate cancer to regulate epithelial\u2013mesenchymal transition process by targeting flotillin-2 [26]. Therefore, the role of miR-802 is cell type specific and depends on the molecular targets acting downstream. Our study reveals that the miRNA has a novel role in controlling inflammatory response. In lung tissue particularly lung macrophages, miR-802 targets Peli2 in TLR4 pathway. The enforced expression of miR-802 seems unlikely to induce any unwanted risks such as oncogenesis. Therefore, targeting miR-802/Peli2 axis holds a promise to develop therapeutics for ARDS.",

However, our study only focuses on sterile inflammatory ARDS model induced by LPS. It will be important to evaluate the role of miR-802 in other mouse model of ARDS, such as an infectious model driven by Streptococcus pneumoniae or ventilator-induced acute lung injury [5, 6].
