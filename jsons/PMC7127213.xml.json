It was first described by Dr. Tomisaku Kawasaki in Japan in 1967.1 The coronary artery involvement and cardiac morbidity were subsequently realised in the autopsies conducted on patients with KD. Since then, the world over, KD has been recognised as a leading cause of acquired heart disease especially in the developed countries, with higher incidence in Japanese children. KD is rare in infants aged <6 months. These infants have been described to have atypical, prolonged and severe manifestations of KD, which is commonly refractory to standard therapy. We herein describe KD in a 3-month-old infant patient who was diagnosed and treated early with infliximab as the alternative rescue therapy, which produced dramatic clinical response.",

            "text": "A 2.5-month-old female infant patient was brought to our hospital with complaints of high-grade fever of 2 days duration, macular rash most prominent over the upper part of body, extreme irritability and severe diarrhoea. There was no history of seizures, lethargy, increased chest activity, or abdominal distension. On examination, she was found to be irritable with high-grade continuous fever. Initially, she was managed as a case of sepsis, with broad-spectrum antibiotics, despite which she continued to be symptomatic. At admission, she had anaemia (haemoglobin 8.9 gm/dl), polymorphonuclear leucocytosis (total leucocyte count 17,600/mm3 with 85% neutrophils), normal platelet count and raised C-reactive protein (CRP; 24 mg/L) and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR; 34 mm/h). Cerebrospinal fluid analysis was normal. Other workup including urine and blood cultures and abdominal ultrasonography was normal. She showed poor response to the therapy (including up to gradation of parenteral antibiotics), in view of which, an alternative diagnosis was sought. On the 4th day into illness, she was noticed to have right-sided non-tender cervical lymphadenopathy measuring 1.5 cm \u00d7 1.5 cm, bilateral non-purulent conjunctivitis and erythema over lips and tongue. A day later, the patient also developed extensive perineal desquamation (Fig. 1\n). At this stage, a possible clinical diagnosis of KD was entertained. The ESR and CRP showed rising titres (48 mm/h and 60 mg/L respectively, on the 5th day of illness), and thrombocytosis (platelet count 4.2 Lac/mm3) developed. A two-dimensional echocardiography at this stage was normal. Standard dose (2 gm/kg) of intravenous immunoglobulin was infused over 12 h to which she showed only partial response in terms of defervescence. In view of this, a second dose of Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) (2 gm/Kg) was administered along with antiinflammatory dose of acetyl salicylic acid (100 mg/kg). However, she exhibited poor clinical response and continued to be febrile. At this stage (early 2nd week into illness), she developed desquamation of the skin of hands and feet. Repeat haematological parameters revealed worsening anaemia (Hb 7.9 gm%), polymorphonuclear leucocytosis (total leucocyte count 34,600/mm3), thrombocytosis (platelet count 5,71,000/mm3) and hypoalbuminemia (serum albumin 2.2 gm/dl). Peripheral blood smear showed a shift to the left and vacuolation in the leucocytes. A repeat echocardiography also revealed no abnormality. Thrombocytosis showed increasing trend in the ensuing 2 days. In view of no significant clinical improvement, she was administered Inj methylprednisolone 30 mg/kg for 3 days, following which, although she remained afebrile for 48 h, the fever recurred, later in the second week into illness. Inj infliximab (5 mg/kg) was then administered as a rescue measure, following which she became afebrile within 24 h, with no recurrence of fever thereafter. A repeat echocardiography at this juncture (at the end of the 2nd week) revealed large coronary aneurysms involving right coronary arteries (RCAs), left main coronary arteries (LMCAs), left anterior descending coronary arteries (LADCAs) and left circumflex coronary arteries (LCxCAs) (Fig. 2\n), normal biventricular systolic and diastolic function and mild pericardial effusion. The 12-lead electrocardiogram was normal. Oral steroid and injection of low-molecular-weight heparin were also added. After discharge, serial echocardiography studies on follow-up revealed gradual and significant reduction in the size of coronary artery aneurysms (CAAs) after 3 months and complete regression after 12 months (Table 1\n). She was continued on antiplatelet dose of acetyl salicylic acid throughout the follow-up.",

Infants younger than 6 months with prolonged unexplained febrile illnesses should be suspected as having KD despite the incomplete clinical presentation.
