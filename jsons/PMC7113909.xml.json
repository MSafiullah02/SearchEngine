            "text": "The overall performance of a poultry flock is dependent on various factors such as feed quality, poultry house management, and the presence of pathogenic microorganisms. One of the largest contributing factors to thriving flocks is the development and proper functioning of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. The avian GI tract represents a site of nutrient absorption and contains many different types of microorganisms (collectively known as the microbiome) and plays host to a variety of commensal and pathogenic microbes including viruses, bacteria, and fungi. Sub-optimal functioning of the GI tract can result in poor performance and can lead to production problems such as a poorer feed conversion ratio (FCR; the efficiency of converting feed to body mass), uneven flock growth, and can be caused by enteric diseases such as runting-stunting syndrome (RSS) in broiler chickens.",

(1978a, b) who described signs such as proventriculitis, poor FCR, and runting, which is defined as undersized at hatch. Further research described a wide variety of clinical signs including growth depression, irregular feathering (helicopter feathering, abnormal colouring), the presence of watery diarrhoea, other enteric problems such as intestinal lesions and pale intestines, and in severe cases mortality (Smart et al., 1988; Shapiro et al., 1998; Otto et al., 2006; De Wit et al., 2011). Globally, the incidence of RSS and uneven flock growth can cause substantial economic losses to poultry producers due to culls of stunted, undersized birds that are too small to pass through the processing plant.",

Metagenomic research into a similar disease in turkeys, known as poult enterits complex, has helped shed some light into the range of enteric pathogens associated with avian malabsorption diseases (Day et al., 2010; Day & Zsak, 2013) with Day et al. (2010) describing at least 16 different RNA viral genera from a pool of affected birds. Other enteric pathogens associated with avian malabsorption diseases include reoviruses, parvoviruses, and members of the family Caliciviridae; many of which have also been observed in broiler chickens (Spackman et al., 2005; Smyth et al., 2007; Pantin-Jackwood et al., 2008, Wolf et al., 2011, Zsak et al., 2013). Pantin-Jackwood et al. (2008) demonstrated the presence of ANV in chicken flocks but also in turkey flocks for the first time indicating that some level of cross-species interaction can occur. Additionally, Day et al. (2007) demonstrated that both turkeys and chickens exhibit species-specific viruses such as turkey astrovirus and CAstV.",

Using current NGS technologies it is possible to achieve deep sequencing coverage from samples that permits comparative metagenomic analysis between samples to identify key pathogens related to avian enteric disease. Bacterial metagenomics via amplicon sequencing is a well-researched area due to the availability of the highly conserved 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequence found in bacteria (Riesenfeld et al., 2004; Gill et al., 2006; Wang & Qian, 2009). As there is no viral equivalent of the 16S rRNA gene it is more appropriate to use a shotgun sequencing approach to discover novel viruses from environmental samples.",

The birds tested in the 2006 study ranged from 5 to 14 days of age compared to the present study which tested 2\u20133-week-old birds.

The majority of viral contigs (293) in this metagenomic analysis were assigned to the unclassified Picornaviridae category with the remaining contigs (82) assigned to 3 recognized genera \u2013 Gallivirus, Kobuvirus, and Megrivirus (Figure 2). Within these genera, viral contigs showed similarity to multiple species such as chicken gallivirus 1 (Gallivirus), aichivirus C (Kobuvirus), and chicken megrivirus (Megrivirus). A total of 217 contigs characterized as unclassified Picornaviridae showed similarity to the species sicinivirus 1, a novel picornavirus isolated from commercial broiler chickens in Cork, Ireland (Bullman et al., 2014) and recently reported in mainland China (Zhou et al., 2015). Sicinivirus 1 contigs were almost exclusively associated with RSS-affected samples with only one sicinivirus 1 contig associated with unaffected sample VF14-181 A1. Sicinivirus 1 was commonly found alongside chicken megrivirus, chicken picornavirus 1, 4, and 5, and aichivirus C however the pathogenic potential of sicinivirus 1 is yet to be determined. The remaining viral contigs (76) associated with the unclassified Picornaviridae displayed similarity to chicken picornavirus 1, 4, and 5, picornavirus chicken/CHK1/USA/2010, pigeon picornavirus B, and aichivirus C. The species chicken picornavirus 1, 4, 5, chicken megrivirus, and aichivirus C were only associated with the affected samples compared to picornavirus chicken/CHK1/USA/2010, pigeon picornavirus B, and chicken gallivirus 1 which were found in both affected and unaffected samples. Members of the Picornaviridae are characterized by non-enveloped icosahedral virions, around 30 nm in diameter, containing a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome, 7\u20139 kb in length (Stanway, 1990; LeGall et al., 2008). Picornaviruses have been linked to disease across multiple species (such as sheep, cattle, humans, felines, and birds) and have been implicated in enteric disease (Knox et al., 2012; Tapparel et al., 2013). Previous metagenomic studies into the avian gut microbiome have identified multiple picornavirus species in disease-affected and healthy birds, findings which have been echoed in the present study. However, the pathogenic potential of these viruses in avian species remains relatively unknown due to the large amount of genetic variation observed among these viruses (Day et al., 2010; Farkas et al., 2012; Bullman et al., 2014; Day et al., 2015, Day & Zsak, 2015; Zhou et al., 2015). In the present study picornaviruses were commonly found alongside the Astroviridae, Caliciviridae, Parvoviridae, and bacteriophage families (Table 1) and seem to be prevalent in growth-stunted birds. Due to the large number of picornavirus strains in circulation it is perhaps unsurprising that picornavirus contigs were also detected in the unaffected samples and it is possible that non-pathogenic picornavirus strains may be constituents of a healthy avian gut virome.",

All viral contigs (20) assigned to the Coronaviridae family belonged to the genus Gammacoronavirus (Figure 2) with all 20 of the viral contigs displaying high similarity (98\u2013100% nucleotide identity) to infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). Although both unaffected samples were observed to also have IBV contigs, this may be due to the small sample set tested. Members of this family are characterized by enveloped, positive-stranded RNA genomes, 26\u201332 kb in length (Brian & Baric, 2005; Gorbalenya et al., 2006). Coronaviruses have been detected in a variety of wild birds and are responsible for mild to severe respiratory signs, central nervous system diseases, and GI diseases (Gallagher & Buchmeier, 2001; Weiss & Navas-Martin, 2005; Weiss & Leibowitz, 2011). The main coronavirus affecting chickens is IBV which can cause respiratory disease and can also replicate in non-respiratory areas such as enteric tissues. Although IBV is not typically associated with enteric disease it may contribute to enteritis in combination with other microbial factors (Cavanagh & Gelb Jr., 2003; Cavanagh, 2007; Jackwood et al., 2012).",

A total of 98 viral contigs displayed similarity to calicivirus isolates calicivirus chicken/V0021/Bayern/2004 (85\u201396% nucleotide identity), calicivirus chicken/V0027/Bayern/2004 (90\u201393% nucleotide identity), and calicivirus chicken/V0013/Bayern/2004 (89% nucleotide identity) with the remaining contigs (15) showing similarity to chicken calicivirus isolates chicken/L11038 polyprotein gene (90\u201398% nucleotide identity), chicken/L11041 polyprotein gene (91\u201396% nucleotide identity), and caliciQ45/2013 polyprotein gene (81\u201393% nucleotide identity). The Caliciviridae family is comprised of five recognized genera (Lagovirus, Nebovirus, Norovirus, Sapovirus, and Vesivirus) and an unclassified Caliciviridae genus with the Caliciviridae contigs in this study belonging to the unclassified Caliciviridae genus. Virions belonging to the Caliciviridae family are typically non-enveloped, around 30\u201340 nm in diameter, and with an RNA genome of around 7.5 kb in length (Thiel & K\u00f6nig, 1999). The Caliciviridae family can infect a variety of host organisms including humans, birds, pigs, cattle, and avian species and have been associated with gastroenteritis in humans as early as the 1970s (Kapikian et al., 1972; Smith et al., 1977; Chen et al., 2006; Wolf et al., 2009). Calicivirus has been detected and characterized from both healthy chickens and chickens displaying growth retardation via electron microscopy, reverse transcriptase PCR and NGS (Day et al., 2010; Wolf et al., 2011; Day et al., 2015). A previous metagenomic analysis of specific pathogen free (SPF) and SPF sentinel birds performed by Day et al. (2015) described the majority of viral contigs (11,309) associated with the SPF flock being assigned to the Caliciviridae family (99.05%) with the virus appearing to clear from sentinel birds placed on commercial farms with enteric and respiratory problems although testing of a backyard sentinel flock, with a history of enteric disease, identified 7819 contigs (25.55%) assigned to the Caliciviridae family. Conversely, in the present study, members of the Caliciviridae were more commonly associated with RSS-affected samples with the most common isolate being calicivirus chicken/V0021/Bayern/2004, the same isolate described by Day et al. (2015) in the SPF and backyard flocks, this isolate was also detected in unaffected sample VF14-181 A1. Contigs displaying similarity to the isolates L11038, L11041, Q45, and calicivirus chicken/V0027/Bayern/2004 were only found in RSS-affected samples possibly suggesting an association with enteric disease while isolate calicivirus chicken/V0013/Bayern/2004 was only associated with unaffected sample VF14-181 A1 and not in affected samples. Interestingly, there were no Caliciviridae contigs associated with affected sample VF14-92 A1 (Table 1).",

            "text": "The present study has identified 433 viral contigs displaying similarity (81\u2013100% nucleotide identity) to the Avastrovirus genus (Table 1, Figure 2), specifically the species CAstV and ANV sero- or genotypes 1 (ANV 1), 2 (ANV 2), and 3 (ANV 3). Members of the Avastrovirus genus, especially ANV and CAstV, are strongly associated with RSS and the current study reports a much higher viral profile associated with this genus in RSS-affected samples with much lower profiles being observed in unaffected samples (Figure 2). Contigs associated with the Astroviridae were commonly found in combination with the Caliciviridae, Picornaviridae, and Parvoviridae families (Table 1) which has been described in previous metagenomic studies in chickens and turkeys (Day et al., 2015; Day & Zsak, 2015). Viral contigs assigned to the CAstV and ANV 1 species were only associated with the affected sample set. Viral contigs associated with the ANV 2 and ANV 3 species were associated with both affected and unaffected sample sets with a notably larger ANV 2 profile associated with the affected samples. This may suggest greater ANV 2 strain diversity within the affected samples with certain strains exerting a greater pathogenic effect leading to stunted growth. Day et al. (2015) described a very low Astroviridae profile associated with a SPF flock (2 contigs, 0.02%). By contrast, Day reported increased levels of astrovirus contigs (1.14\u201398.97%) associated with sentinel SPF birds placed on commercial farms with enteric problems indicating that members of the Astroviridae family are more commonly found in flocks with growth problems and enteric disease. The Astroviridae family contains a group of enteric viruses which can infect multiple mammalian hosts (Genus: Mamastrovirus) and avian hosts (genus: Avastrovirus) causing a range of enteric disease signs such as diarrhoea, enteritis, interstitial nephritis and has been linked with visceral gout and RSS (Yamaguchi et al., 1979; McNulty et al., 1984; Herrmann et al., 1991; Greenberg & Matsui, 1992; Moser & Schultz-Cherry, 2005; Spackman et al., 2010; Benedictis et al., 2011; Lee et al., 2013). First identified in 1975 (Madeley & Cosgrove, 1975) Astroviridae are characterized as small, non-enveloped virions with a positive-sensed RNA genome around 7 kb in length (Jiang et al., 1993; Carter, 1994; Willcocks et al., 1994). The Avastrovirus genus contains at least six recognized species \u2013 ANV, CAstV, duck astrovirus types 1 and 2, and turkey astrovirus types 1 and 2. Previous studies have identified astroviruses in both growth-stunted and healthy avian hosts (Reynolds et al., 1987; Baxendale & Mebatsion, 2004; Pantin-Jackwood et al., 2006; Kang et al., 2012).",

            "text": "Avian Orthoreoviruses (ARV) can be present without disease in broiler chickens however reovirus infection can lead to several disease signs such as tenosynovitis, growth suppression, and enteritis and can also cause immunosuppression leaving the host susceptible to other infections (Hieronymus et al., 1983; Jones & Kibenge, 1984; Sharma et al., 1994; Jones, 2000). Although reoviruses are widespread among avian hosts, the present study reports detection of reovirus in only one sample (VF-14 181 A1) which represents a healthy flock. The low detection rate of ARV may be a consequence of the small sample set tested or may suggest their relative abundance is low compared to other viruses. Reovirus contigs obtained from sample VF14-181 A1 were assigned to the Orthoreovirus genus (Figure 2, species: Avian orthoreovirus) and displayed homology to the L1, L2, L3, S1, and S4 genome segments and the lambdaB core protein gene. The family Reoviridae, consisting of two subfamilies comprising of 15 genera, contains a group of viruses with a wide host range including invertebrates, vertebrates, plants, and fungi and has been described in both RSS-affected broiler chickens and healthy chickens (Robertson et al., 1984) and has been detected in previous avian enteric metagenomic studies (Day et al., 2010, 2015). Reoviruses are non-enveloped viruses that contain a segmented (10\u201312 segments) double-stranded RNA genome (Joklik, 1981; Gouet et al., 1999; Forrest & Dermody, 2003).",

            "text": "The Retroviridae family is comprised of two subfamilies (Orthoretrovirinae and Spumaretrovirinae) and contains seven viral genera and has a large host range. This study has detected the presence of one viral contig from one sample, VF14-91 A1 (Table 1), displaying similarity (100% nucleotide identity) to avian erythroblastosis virus (genus: Alpharetrovirus) erbA and erbB genes. Additionally, the same sample had one viral contig displaying 98% nucleotide similarity to the avian endogenous retrovirus gag gene. Endogenous viral elements represent either entire viral genomes or fragments of viral genomes which have become integrated into the host germ line. The remaining viral contigs (63) from the MEGAN analysis displayed short sequence similarity, 30\u201390 bp (from contigs around 250\u2013400 bp in length), to human endogenous retroviruses and the Lentivirus genus. Upon analysis the full contigs displayed homologies to various bacterial genera such as Salmonella, Escherichia, and Bacteroides. Retroviruses reverse transcribe their RNA genome into DNA using their own reverse transcriptase followed by integration into the host genome where they replicate using the host polymerase genes (Dahlberg, 1988; Coffin, 1992; Luciw & Leung, 1992; Gifford & Tristem, 2003). Previous studies have described the presence of endogenous avian retroviruses within domesticated chickens which are vertically transmitted through the host germ line following genomic integration (Frisby & Weiss, 1979). Although not normally linked to disease endogenous avian retroviruses have been related to subgroup J avian leukosis virus, an exogenous avian retrovirus, which has been reported to induce myeloid leukosis, can cause mortality through the development of tumours, and can cause immunosuppression within the host (Purchase et al., 1968; Friedman & Ceglowski, 1971; Payne, 1998; Smith et al., 1998; Fadly & Smith, 1999). It is possible that the presence of avian retroviruses in RSS-affected samples is not directly contributing to enteric disease however the immunosuppression caused by these viruses may leave affected birds susceptible to infection from other viral species.",

Sample VF14-181 A1, representing a healthy flock, contained a combination of avian orthoreovirus (strains T1781, AVS-B, 1017-1 and 138) and chicken parvovirus ABU-P1 (Table 1) mirroring a study by Decaesstecker et al. (1986) in which chicken parvovirus ABU-P1 in combination with reoviruses failed to cause growth retardation in day old chicks following oral inoculation. Conversely, an earlier study isolated chicken parvovirus ABU-P1 from chickens with stunted growth and re-inoculation of embryos and day old SPF chicks with this isolate caused enteritis, a decrease in egg hatchability, and severe growth retardation (Kisary, 1985). All affected samples contained parvovirus contigs although a substantially larger Parvoviridae profile was observed in the unaffected samples compared to the affected samples. Both affected and unaffected samples contained a combination of sequences from members of the Protoparvovirus and Aveparvovirus genera however the affected samples contained more viral contigs assigned to the Protoparvovirus genus while the unaffected samples contained more viral contigs assigned to the Aveparvovirus genus (species: chicken parvovirus ABU-P1). The Paroviridae family is divided in to two sub families (Densovirinae and Parvovirinae) that contain 13 genera between them and are characterized as having a non-enveloped capsid containing a single-stranded DNA genome around 5 kb in length (Berns, 1990; Cotmore & Tattersall, 1995, 2005).",

They are characterized by a circular non-segmented single-stranded DNA genome, around 1.7\u20132.4 kb in length (Finsterbusch & Mankertz, 2009). The present study detected two viral contigs exhibiting similarity (96\u201399% nucleotide identity) to the Gyrovirus genus in only one RSS-affected sample, VF14-92 A1, which specifically showed similarity to chicken anaemia virus (CAV, genus: Gyrovirus) while the unaffected samples displayed no Circoviridae contigs. The circoviruses can infect a range of birds and mammals such as chickens, pigs, dogs, geese, and pigeons (Yuasa et al., 1979; Tischer et al., 1982; Todd et al., 2001; Kapoor et al., 2012). McNulty et al. (1991) described the effects of subclinical CAV infection in broiler chickens resulting in a decrease in profitability and production \u2013 specifically a decrease in the average weight per bird and an adverse effect on FCR theorized to be caused by the immunosuppressive capabilities of CAV. CAV was later detected in four-week-old growth-stunted birds in combination with Cryptosporidium baileyi (Dobos-Kov\u00e1cs et al., 1994) and has been detected in broiler chickens displaying lymphocyte depletion (Van Santen et al., 2001) further indicating a role in immunosuppression. Rosenberger and Cloud (1998) also reported that the immunosuppressive aspects of CAV frequently lead to secondary infections with Clostridium perfringens and Staphylococcus aureus. This immunosuppression, in combination with other viral pathogens, may contribute to the development of RSS. Although CAV was only detected in one sample it is possible that the infection had largely cleared from these 2\u20133-week-old birds and could have been detected if tested at an earlier age. Additionally, it is possible that CAV was present in samples in relatively low abundance. Throughout the virus enrichment process during sample preparation there were losses associated with each of the processing stages. It is possible that the less abundant CAV has been lost in these processing stages therefore not detected in the final sequencing results.",

            "text": "The Caudovirales order contains tailed bacteriophages and comprises the families Siphoviridae, Myoviridae, and Podoviridae and were detected in all samples tested (Table 1). Additionally, the families Leviviridae, Inoviridae, and the unassigned phage category (Table 1) consisted of phage sequences. Within the affected samples there was a large Caudovirales profile associated with samples VF14-91 A1 and VF14-92 A1 (over 50% of the viral contigs for each sample) and relatively little Caudovirales contigs associated with VF14-91 A2 and VF14-92 A2 (Table 1). Interestingly, affected sample VF13-188 E contained no Caudovirales contigs. Unaffected sample VF14-181 A1 had only three contigs associated with the Caudovirales while unaffected sample VF14-181 B1 had a large Caudovirales profile (over 50% viral contigs were assigned to the Caudovirales). In the present study the samples had an overall total of 1165 viral contigs assigned to phage species with the majority of contigs being assigned to the families Siphoviridae (475 contigs) and Myoviridae (652 contigs) (Table 1) making the bacteriophages the most abundant species identified in the current study (45.99% of total viral contigs). Sample VF14-92 A1 had 28 viral contigs assigned to the Podoviridae family. Sample VF13-188 E displayed no similarity to any of the bacteriophage families but had one viral contig identified as an unclassified phage (Table 1). This was similar to samples VF14-92 A2 and VF14-181 A1 which displayed a very low amount of phage contigs (3.82% and 4.62% respectively) compared to the large abundance of phage contigs identified in samples VF14-91 A1 (67.01%), VF14-91 A2 (24.65%), VF14-92 A1 (81.64%), and VF14-181 B1 (58.76%). An increase in viral contigs associated with the Caudovirales may coincide with an overgrowth of specific groups of intestinal bacteria which are then infected by species-specific bacteriophages helping regulate the intestinal microbiota. The majority of the viral contigs assigned to the Caudovirales were identified as enterobacteria phages, enterococcus phages, and bacteroides phages which relate to normal bacterial constituents of the chicken GI tract such as Escherichia coli, Enterococcus species, and Bacteroides species (Devriese et al., 1991; Lu et al., 2003; Amit-Romach et al., 2004). These viruses are widespread and co-exist with bacterial populations across a large range of hosts and environments and aid in regulating the diversity, population, and function of microbial communities (Riesenfeld et al., 2004). The role of bacteriophages in relation to RSS is unclear and represents an interesting group for further study since previous metagenomic studies have also detected members of the Caudovirales order as part of the broiler chicken gut microbiota in growth retarded flocks (Kim & Mundt, 2011; Day et al., 2015).",

The use of high-throughput NGS in this study, and a small number of other studies, presents a viable technique for the characterization of the complex viral communities present in the GI tract of disease-affected and unaffected broiler chickens. This study presents preliminary data on the viral communities present in the poultry gut from a small number of samples and has identified multiple viral families historically associated with RSS co-infecting broiler guts, along with the broad characterization of other viral families such as the Siphoviridae, Myoviridae, and Podoviridae in relation to the disease. Additionally, this study attempts to characterize the virome associated with unaffected broiler chickens with the results showing a difference in the viral contigs assigned in the unaffected samples \u2013 typically many of the same families are observed in unaffected samples but with a lower number of viral contigs assigned to these families when compared to affected samples. The main viral families related to RSS-affected samples from this study included Astroviridae, Caliciviridae, Picornaviridae, Parvoviridae, Coronaviridae, Siphoviridae, and Myoviridae although many of these viral families were also found in unaffected samples indicating that certain strains within these families may be constituents of a normal broiler gut virome. One of the advantages of the sequencing platforms used is their ability to be semi-quantitative; the sequencing reads and contigs output by the platforms are assumed to be representative of the microbial contents within a tested sample. However, the use of whole genome and WTA steps in the sequencing procedures have previously been shown to introduce bias to sequencing results (Pinard et al., 2006) resulting in a non-quantitative analysis. The present study had to use whole genome and WTA methods to generate sufficient viral genomic material from samples for library preparation and as such these results cannot be considered quantitative however the kit used to perform these procedures was shown to generally minimize bias when compared to other similar kits (Pinard et al., 2006). Furthermore it might be assumed that any bias from WGA methods may apply equally across all samples although further bias may be subsequently introduced by library preparation methods specific to each platform or kit. Subsequent quantitative studies currently underway via quantitative real-time PCR will help clarify the roles these viruses play in RSS and would aid in understanding the differences in viral load associated with each virus. These studies will also help characterize the differences between affected and unaffected birds leading to a greater knowledge of the key viral agents associated with RSS.",
