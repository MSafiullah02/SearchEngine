This review describes the possible manifestations of the common diseases as well as highlighting some of the uncommon causes of sinonasal inflammation which may have importance for treatment and prognosis. The diagnosis of fungal sinusitis is primarily histological. It is important to distinguish between invasive and non-invasive fungal sinusitis, the latter including allergic fungal sinusitis characterized by 'allergic mucin' and scanty fungal hyphae. Nasal eosinophilia is a feature of both allergic and non-allergic rhinosinusitis and a wide range of secondary changes in inflammatory polyps may lead to diagnostic confusion. Nasal biopsies are often taken from perforations or inflammatory masses to confirm or exclude granulomatous diseases. There is a broad differential diagnosis for granulomatous sinonasal disease and pathologists should appreciate the diagnostic histological and clinical features of these conditions.

The cavities are surrounded by bone and cartilage with a midline septum, floors formed by the hard palate and lateral walls formed by the palatine, maxillary and ethmoid bones which support the three turbinates. The meati beneath the turbinates are the sites into which drain the posterior ethmoidal sinus (superior meatus), other ethmoidal cells, maxillary and frontal sinuses (middle meatus) and the nasolachrymal duct (inferior meatus). The sphenoid sinus drains into the sphenoethmoidal recess behind the superior turbinate. Obstruction to drainage by anatomical variation or mucosal disease around the narrow ostial meati is the cause of much sinus pathology. Functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) with flexible nasendoscopy allows surgeons to visualize sinus disease and has improved the quality of surgery to improvement the drainage of the sinuses and the removal of diseased tissues.",

While eosinophils are characteristically seen in patients with allergies to pollen, fungi, bacterial proteins such as Staphylococcus aureus superantigen or aspirin, they are also seen in patients with no demonstrable allergies (NARES).",

The cause of Wegener's granulomatosis is unknown but neutrophils are regarded as key to the pathogenesis of the acute injury causing endothelial damage and being targets for the autoimmune response. 35, 36 Genetic factors and complex alterations in T helper cell responses promote granuloma formation. 37 Most patients present with sinusitis, nasal discharge or bleeding and the disease can destroy the nasal septum. 38 Seventy percent of patients will develop crescentic glomerulonephritis and many will have systemic symptoms reflecting small-vessel inflammation in the lungs, skin, joints and nerves. The diagnosis is facilitated by testing for C-ANCA which is directed against neutrophil proteinase-3 (PR3-ANCA) in 90% patients, or myeloperoxidase (MPO-ANCA). For entry into European clinical trials, a diagnosis of Wegener's granulomatosis requires a history of chronic inflammation for at least four weeks which is not attributable to another cause, supported by characteristic biopsy histology and/ or detectable C-ANCA and/or detectable PR3-ANCA. 39 Confirmatory histology in non-renal biopsies requires an inflammatory infiltrate that is dominated by neutrophils accompanied by at least one of necrotizing small-vessel vasculitis, granulomas or giant cells (Figure 19 ). The differential diagnosis includes other small-vessel vasculitides associated with ANCA, especially microscopic polyangiitis and ChurgeStrauss syndrome.",

Clinically significant disease affects the lungs, skin and kidneys, although severe renal disease is uncommon. C-ANCA are present in about 40% patients and are usually P-ANCA or MPO-ANCA. 41 Biopsies typically show an eosinophil-rich inflammatory infiltrate and may also show vasculitis and granulomatous inflammation. 41 Relapsing polychondritis Relapsing polychondritis is a rare disease presenting in young and middle-aged adults with recurrent episodes of painful acute inflammation resulting in destruction of the cartilages of the nose and ears. 42 Tracheal chondritis leads to airway obstruction and pneumonia. Other manifestations include migratory arthritis, ocular inflammation, cardiac and neurological disease. About one third of patients have other autoimmune diseases and there is overlap with Behcet's disease e the so-called MAGIC syndrome of mouth and genital ulcers with inflamed cartilage. 43 Figure 18 Granulomatous inflammation due to sarcoidosis has well defined epithelioid cell granulomas. Circulating antibodies to type II collagen is found in many patients. 42 Biopsies of the involved cartilage show loss of mucopolysaccharide matrix and erosion by lymphocytes ( Figure 20) . Neutrophils may be present in the early stages and there is usually perichondrial granulation tissue and fibrosis. 42 The diagnosis is primarily clinical and immunological.",
