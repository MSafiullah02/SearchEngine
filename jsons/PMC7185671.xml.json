            "text": "Noroviruses are a major cause of epidemic and sporadic gastroenteritis in humans (Green, 2013). They were also identified in cattle and other animal species with reports of lesions and clinical signs of gastroenteritis (Bridger et al., 1984, Hsu et al., 2007, Martella et al., 2007, Ntafis et al., 2010, Pinto et al., 2012, Scipioni et al., 2008a, Sugieda and Nakajima, 2002, Wang et al., 2007, Wolf et al., 2009). Noroviruses belong to the genus Norovirus, within the Caliciviridae family. They are non-enveloped viruses with a diameter of approximately 27\u201340 nm and possess a positive-sense, single stranded RNA genome of around 7.5 kb composed of three open reading frames (ORF) (Green, 2013). The ORF1 encodes a large polyprotein that is further cleaved into at least six non-structural proteins by the viral 3C-like protease, including the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp, P). ORF2 and ORF3 encode the major (VP1) and minor (VP2) capsid proteins, respectively (Green, 2013). The VP1 capsid protein is organized into two domains: a shell domain (S domain, N-terminal part) and a protruding domain (P domain, C-terminal part, exhibiting two sub-domains: P1 and P2) (Prasad et al., 1999). The P2 is a hypervariable domain and has an external localization, compatible with its function of both cell receptor ligand and immunogenic determinant (Tan et al., 2004).",

As no cell culture system has been established for growing Norovirus (with the exception of murine strains), currently reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and genomic sequencing are used for characterizing viruses and understanding the phylogenetic relationships among strains detected in animals and humans worldwide. Routinely, Noroviruses are genotyped by analysis of partial capsid (VP1) or polymerase (RdRp) gene sequences. However, genotyping based exclusively on one region of Norovirus genome is not an accurate representation of viral epidemiology, especially due to frequent recombination within Noroviruses (Bull et al., 2007). Recombination commonly occurs at the ORF1\u2013ORF2 junction although other recombination sites have been reported (Bull et al., 2005, Bull et al., 2007, Chhabra et al., 2010, Eden et al., 2013). To address the inconsistencies in Norovirus genotyping, a nomenclature system which incorporates both polymerase and capsid regions has been proposed (Kroneman et al., 2013). At least six genogroups (GI to GVI) have been described in the genus Norovirus and a tentative genogroup VII has been proposed (Green, 2013, Vinj\u00e9, 2015).",

Bull et al. defined recombinant Norovirus as those that cluster with two distinct groups of Norovirus strains when two different regions (normally, the capsid and the RdRp) of the genome are phylogenetically analyzed (Bull et al., 2005). Studying all available sequences in 2007, Bull et al. reported the existence of two recombinant prototypes for bovine Noroviruses: GIII.P1_GIII.2 and GIII.P2_GIII.1 with Bo/UK/2000/GIII.P1_GIII.2/Thirsk10 and Bo/US/2003/GIII.P2_GIII.1/B-1SVD as reference strains, respectively (Bull et al., 2007, Oliver et al., 2004). Since then, molecular characterization of bovine Noroviruses from diverse geographical settings have revealed the circulation of a number of recombinant strains genetically related to Bo/UK/2000/GIII.P1_GIII.2/Thirsk10 (Di Martino et al., 2014, Han et al., 2004, Jor et al., 2010, Mauroy et al., 2009b).

Among cattle infectious diseases, neonatal calf diarrhea is considered an important sanitary problem of both beef and dairy cattle (Virtala et al., 1996). Molecular detection of bovine Norovirus sequences has been frequently associated with calf diarrhea (Scipioni et al., 2008b). Their pathogenicity is believed to be low or moderate (Jung et al., 2014), although studies analyzing their economic impact (weight loss, health status, veterinary treatment cost) as co-infecting agent in combination with other enteric pathogens have not yet been conducted. Molecular characterizations of bovine Noroviruses circulating in cattle from different regions of the world have been performed but still there is scarce data regarding South American countries, where large cattle populations are living, such as Argentina or Brazil. The aim of this study was to investigate the presence and genetic diversity of bovine Noroviruses in fecal samples from Argentinean diarrheic dairy calves.",

It is important to highlight that phylogenetic analysis of the remaining four amplicons indicated that those sequences were closely related to a ruminant bacteria named Prevotella sp.

These three samples came from young calves with diarrhea from different provinces of Argentina. Sample B4836 was collected from a 9-day-old calf from a dairy herd in Santa Fe province. Sample B4848 came from a 2-day-old calf from Buenos Aires province and B4881 was taken from a 3-day-old animal from C\u00f3rdoba province. All Norovirus positive samples were collected in 2012. Using the BLAST tool, the three partial sequences obtained from RdRp gene showed to be genetically most closely related to GIII bovine Norovirus sequences. The sequence of B4848 was most closely related with GIII.1 viruses, whereas both B4836 and B4881 were most closely related to GIII.2 viruses (Fig. 1A). Considering the fact that recombination commonly occurs at the ORF1-ORF2 junction, we attempted to get the complete VP1 coding sequences by next generation sequencing, which was successful for the B4848 and B4881 strains. By phylogenetic analyses, these two sequences were more closely related to GIII.1 viruses (Fig. 1B). This indicates contradictory phylogenetic inferences for B4881, grouping the polymerase (ORF1, RdRp) and capsid regions (ORF2, VP1) of this strain into different genotypes, which may suggest recombination between the RdRp and VP1 coding regions at the genotype level.",

For ORF1, the percentage of nucleotide identity between B4881 and GIII.1 Jena was between 83% and 91%, while the similarity to GIII.2 Newbury2 was between 63% and 82% (Fig. 2\n). However, Fig. 2 shows a putative recombination breakpoint located within the ORF1/ORF2 overlap, from where B4881 nucleotide sequence seems to be more similar to GIII.2 Newbury2 sequence than to GIII.1 Jena. Furthermore, for the ORF2/3 region, the similarity between B4881 and both GIII.1 Jena and GIII.2 Newbury2 strains is particularly low, especially in the more variable region of the capsid coding sequence (P domain).

Thus, detection rate results by RT-PCR seem to depend on the continent, the country, the sampling strategy, the test strategy (conventional RT-PCR or qPCR), and the test conditions, such as annealing temperature and primers.

It has been shown that B4881 would represent a new genotype, where partial ORF1 sequence is more conserved and still close to GIII.2 genotype but ORF2/3 sequences are too divergent from previously described genotypes, and therefore it has been tentatively named GIII.4. From an evolutionary point of view, the ability to exchange VP1 sequences from different genotypes could give bovine Noroviruses another alternative for herd immunity evasion and a potential evolutionary strategy. Even if the genetic diversity within GIII seems to be lower than in some other genogroups (Mauroy et al., 2012, Mauroy et al., 2014, Zheng et al., 2006) and in the absence of biologically relevant criteria's (such as virus neutralization analysis), the definition of clear cut-off in term of pairwise divergence for those sequences will be soon needed. Epidemiologically, this data is also important as it indicates that most of the changes at the amino acid sequence level are located in the P domain of the major capsid protein, VP1. This may have major implications in the immunogenic characteristics of this novel genotype. More studies should be carried out in other to determine this matter as well as the relative prevalence of this potentially new genotype in this and other parts of the world. Further epidemiological analysis of sequences from this specific region of the world would clarify the hypothesis of topotypes for bovine Noroviruses and determine the genetic divergence of the viruses circulating in the region.",
