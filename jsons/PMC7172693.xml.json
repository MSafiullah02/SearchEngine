Viral pneumonia in children has been associated with rhinoviruses.15 However, their role in the etiology of lower tract infections is subject to debate. The presence of respiratory picornavirus RNA does not necessarily prove a cause\u2013effect relationship and combined viral\u2013bacterial infections are possible.15 In our study the higher C-reactive protein levels in children who were picornavirus positive only by PCR suggest that some of their symptoms may have been caused by secondary bacterial superinfection16, 17, 18 and that the highly sensitive xTAG multiplex PCR detected also past symptomatic or asymptomatic viral infections. It has been shown that enterovirus and rhinovirus RNA can persist for several weeks after the onset of symptomatic respiratory infection6, 19 and is detected in a substantial proportion of children without respiratory symptoms.19, 20, 21, 22 Thus, the relative insensitivity of IF might be a benefit for clinical practice.11, 23, 24 As our clinical data were analyzed retrospectively and as we did not collect blood cultures routinely we cannot provide any data to support the hypothesis of a possible bacterial superinfection in these children, but predisposition to bacterial infection after viral infection is well-known.15\n",
