Overall, the HA-VRI incidence rate was lowest in the neonatal intensive care unit. Rates in the pediatric intensive care, oncology, and medical/ surgical units were similar. The most common etiology of HA-VRI at both institutions was rhinovirus (49% of cases), followed by parainfluenza virus and respiratory syncytial virus.

The availability of multiplex nucleic acid amplification tests that detect a panel of respiratory viruses has made laboratory-based surveillance of HA-VRIs feasible and less time-consuming. In pediatric wards and hospitals, HA-VRI often mirrors community-acquired VRI in patients admitted for care. HA-VRIs represented 10% of HAIs in pediatric wards in a recent point-prevalence survey [8] , whereas in another study, close to 20% of infants and toddlers admitted to a tertiary-care pediatric hospital had a virus detected in their nasopharyngeal specimen [10] . Although the overall burdens of HA-VRI and outbreaks of specific viruses were reported previously [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] , benchmarks for comparison are not readily available. Our objective was to determine, compare, and assess determinants of unit-specific HA-VRI incidence rates in 2 children's hospitals.",

This rate was lower than the currently reported incidence rates. These differences might be explained by differences in the number of hospital days before the onset of symptoms required by the HA-VRI definition and the fact that our study included all VRIs, not only febrile HA-VRIs.

            "text": "The lowest HA-VRI incidence rates were found in the NICU. Other types of units had similar rates. It is possible that visitor restrictions contributed to this difference, but another contributor might be the fact that the reservoir of patients with (mainly community-acquired) VRI is likely lowest in the NICU compared to other units, thus decreasing the risk of nosocomial transmission. It is also interesting to note that units with less than 50% single rooms had higher HA-VRI rates when we adjusted for confounders and accounted for correlation of data within a hospital. A 50% cutoff was chosen because healthcare workers who evaluated the impact of 100% single rooms in new facilities considered the ideal room mix on a ward to be 50% single-bed rooms and 50% multiple-beds room [30] . However, this should not be translated to mean that, regardless of the unit type or category, a higher proportion of single rooms would correlate with a lower HA-VRI rate. For instance, the proportion of single rooms was 0% in both NICUs in our study, yet these NICUs had the lowest overall HA-VRI rates. Although single-patient rooms are the goal in most new hospital designs, no evidence-based consensus currently exists on the efficacy of that setup in preventing the acquisition of HA multidrug-resistant organisms transmitted by direct or indirect contact (e.g., methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus and Clostridium difficile). Teltsch et al [31] found that changing the ICU layout from multibed rooms to single rooms decreased the multidrug-resistant organism acquisition rate by 54% (95% CI, 29%-70%), but Ellison et al [32] did not find any difference associated with a similar change in layout on a general internal medicine ward. Organisms acquired through direct or indirect contact are also transmitted on healthcare workers' hands, shared equipment, and fomites; therefore, single rooms might not be sufficient to prevent nosocomial acquisition in the absence of diligent hand hygiene and housekeeping. Similar to multidrug-resistant HA organisms, HA-VRIs are transmitted by direct and indirect contact and also via droplets; therefore, single rooms might be more efficacious in preventing HA-VRI transmission through decreased crowding.",

Previous studies reported that the proportion of community-acquired acute respiratory infections caused by rhinovirus was, on average, 20% in children who required hospital admission [33, 34] . However, for children with a more severe presentation who required admission to the PICU for community-acquired lower respiratory tract infection and in whom a virus was identified, rhinovirus represented the etiological agent in 49% of the cases [35] . However, given the prolonged shedding of rhinovirus and its detection with nucleic acid amplification-based testing, it is difficult to tease out the proportion of positive tests that are clinically significant and the etiological role of rhinovirus in community-and healthcare-acquired respiratory infections. For instance, in an adult cohort of patients who presented with acute respiratory infection, rhinovirus was identified by polymerase chain reaction in 18% (444 of 2485) of the cases, and prolonged shedding was identified in 35% of the patients [36] . In a case-control study, rhinovirus was associated with community-acquired pneumonia in adults (adjusted odds ratio, 13.4 [95% CI, 3.04-59.1]) but not in children (adjusted odds ratio, 1.13 [95% CI, 0.84-1.51]) [34] . Management guidelines for febrile infants aged less than 90 days of life who present to the emergency department have recommended that the presence of rhinovirus in a nasopharyngeal specimen be disregarded and that these patients be managed as if they were respiratory virus negative because the presence of rhinovirus does not seem to decrease the likelihood of severe bacterial infection [37] . In the current study, although some patients with HA rhinovirus had a negative respiratory polymerase chain reaction result on hospital admission, the high prevalence of rhinovirus should be interpreted with caution.",

            "text": "Our study had several limitations that could explain the difference in HA-VRI rates between the 2 participating hospitals. First, no standardized definition for HA-VRI currently exists, and the IPAC services at each hospital used slightly different criteria. However, although the surveillance definitions differed slightly, both of them required a new onset of similar symptoms, and 1 definition (MCH) was more precise as to what was considered a respiratory symptom, which made it more operational and less subject to interpretation. Second, minimum durations of hospitalization before the onset of symptoms required to classify an infection as nosocomial were based on published incubation periods for each virus type; these durations were similar but not identical between hospitals and generally were at the lower end of the range for each virus type. These definitions were designed to be sensitive for the detection of HAIs and possible outbreaks. However, a potential exists for misclassification of some community-acquired infections as HAI. Third, the surveillance procedures for HA-VRI differed; 1 hospital was more aggressive in actively finding cases (including syndromic surveillance for which viral testing was either negative or not requested), whereas the other hospital was using a surveillance system that was laboratory based, which again potentially explains the difference in rates. This difference in case findings, however, is the Achille's heel of all surveillance programs. Fourth, the case mix of patients in both hospitals also differed; chronically ventilator-dependent patients who attended out-of-hospital daycare were accounted for in HAI surveillance at the MCH. IPAC guidelines for additional precautions and visitation policies also differed. Last, another limitation to our study was that the detection of HA-VRI that manifested after hospital discharge was incomplete, because no systematic surveillance for HA-VRI is performed after discharge. The only children with HA-VRI with symptom onset after hospital discharge who were likely to be identified were those who presented to the emergency department or were readmitted because of a VRI. Future studies should examine the effect of HA-VRIs and evaluate best practices for preventing such infections, including compliance to influenza vaccination of patients and healthcare workers. The effects of viral testing, visitation policies, personnel work policy with regard to acute respiratory illness, and the proportion of single-patient rooms for given units on HA-VRIs rates should be evaluated also.
