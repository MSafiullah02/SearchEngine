However, only little is known about the humoral immune response against these viruses. Our aim was to establish virus-specific serological assays and to determine the prevalence of immunoglobulin G (IgG) against these three viruses in the general population. Methods: The capsid proteins VP1 of WUPyV and KIPyV and VP2 of HBoV were cloned into baculovirus vectors and expressed in Sf9 insect cells. IgG antibodies against WUPyV VP1, KIPyV VP1, and HBoV VP2 were determined by immunofluorescence assays in 100 plasma samples of blood donors.",

However, WUPyV and KIPyV DNA were found at similar frequencies in control groups without respiratory tract disease [5, 8, 11] . Therefore, the clinical relevance of WUPyV and KIPyV infections is currently unclear. In contrast to PCR assays, serological assays for antibody detection against HBoV are more complex to establish. However, determining immunoglobulin (Ig) M and IgG antibodies in appropriate serum or plasma samples allows to define the point in time of primary infection as well as exposure rates. One study describing the seroepidemiology of polyomaviruses including WUPyV and KIPyV in adults has recently been published [12] .",

Elucidation of the clinical relevance of HBoV has been difficult because of a high co-infection rate of HBoV DNA positive samples with other respiratory viruses. Based on the combination of a high HBoV load in nasopharyngeal samples (> 10 4 copies/ml) and concomitant HBoV DNA detection in sera, a model has been proposed in which HBoV is associated with acute respiratory tract diseases but persists in the respiratory tract for a longer period of time than other respiratory viruses after primary infection [14] . Recent serological studies have demonstrated evidence of primary HBoV infection in children with acute respiratory tract diseases, strongly indicating that HBoV is indeed a respiratory pathogen [15, 16] . In seroprevalence studies from Japan, the United States, China, and Germany the proportions of HBoV IgG-positive samples increased with age during infancy until reaching levels of > 80% at the age of > 4 years [15, [17] [18] [19] .",

Similarly, the VP1 genes of WUPyV and KIPyV were amplified from nasopharyngeal aspirates with the primer pairs WU1673s/WU2782a and KI1501s/KI2727a resulting in amplicons of 1109 bp and 1226 bp, respectively (Table 1 ). Sequences were submitted to GenBank with the accession numbers FJ560720 (HBoV), EU711057 (WUPyV), and FJ647575 (KIPyV). For production of the recombinant baculoviruses BacWUVP1, BacKIVP1, and BacBOVP2 the LR recombination system (Invitrogen, Karlsruhe, Germany) was used according to the recommendations of the manufacturer. Briefly, the amplicons were inserted by TOPO cloning into the pENTR vector (Invitrogen) and subsequently transformed in chemically competent E.coli TOP10 cells (Invitrogen). The resulting plasmids pBOVP2, pWUVP1, and pKIVP1 were extracted from overnight culture with the QIAprepSpin Miniprep Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and sequenced by standard techniques to confirm orientation and sequence identity of the plasmid insert. The plasmid inserts were then transferred into baculoviral DNA by homologous recombination based on Gateway technology and the BaculoDirect system (Invitrogen). The resulting recombinant baculovirus DNA was directly transfected to adherent Sf9 cells in one well of a six-well-plate using Cellfectin reagent (Invitrogen). The cells were kept in TC-100 growth medium (Lonza, Basel, Switzerland) supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 U/ml penicillin, 100 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin, 0.25 \u03bcg/ml amphotericin B, and 100 \u03bcM ganciclovir as selective reagent. After five days, the cell culture supernatant was collected and used to infect fresh Sf9 cells. This procedure was repeated twice, resulting in the supernatant of passage 4 (P4), which was finally collected and stored at 4\u00b0C for further use. Protein expression was confirmed by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) and immunoblotting. To this end, Sf9 cells at approximately 80% confluence were inoculated with recombinant virus of P4. The cells were observed daily until at least 80% of the cells displayed a cytopathic effect, which typically happened after seven days. Subsequently, the cell culture supernatant was collected and centrifuged with 3400 g at 4\u00b0C for 5 min to remove cells and large debris. The samples were separated by 10% SDS-PAGE and blotted on a nitrocellulose membrane by standard procedures. After blocking, immunodetection was performed with HRP-conjugated mouse-anti-V5-antibody (Invitrogen) at a concentration of 188 ng/ml. Bands were visualised by Super-Signal West Pico chemiluminescence substrate (Pierce, Rockford, USA). Uninfected Sf9 cells were used as negative control.",

All samples were also tested by IFA using uninfected Sf9 cells. No positive reaction with cellular antigens was observed in any of the samples. In order to further confirm the specificity of positive IFA results, three plasma samples were studied in an absorption assay. Antibody titers were determined before and after absorption with lysates of Sf9 cells infected with recombinant baculoviruses. A significant titer decrease was only observed after absorption with the matching Sf9 cell lysate (Table 2 ). There was no indication of antibody cross-reaction between Sf9 cells infected with BacWUVP1, BacKIVP1, and BacBOVP2. Of all plasma samples, 89% were positive for anti-WUPyV VP1 IgG, 67% were positive for anti-KIPyV VP1 IgG, and 76% were positive for anti-HBoV VP2 IgG. Neither the median age nor the gender distribution of the antibody positive samples were significantly different from the total population for any of the three viruses tested (Mann-Whitney test and Fisher's exact test, respectively; Table 3 ). For WUPyV and HBoV, there were no significant differences of the seropositivity rates with respect to age groups. For KIPyV, the seropositivity rate increased significantly from 58,7% in the age group 20 -30 years to100% in the age group > 50 years (p = 0.026; chi-square test for trend; Figure 3 ). Table 4 shows the number of samples grouped by individual results for WUPyV, KIPyV, and HBoV IgG.

We found high rates of positive IgG antibodies against all three viruses: 89% for WUPyV, 67% for KIPyV, and 76% for HBoV. Our data on seroprevalence for WUPyV and KIPyV are somewhat higher than reported in a recent study from the United States, which found seroprevalences of 54.1% to 55.3% for KIPyV and 67.4% to 70.9% for WUPyV in the age groups from 21 to 70 years of North American blood donors [12] . In contrast to our findings, a rising prevalence for KIPyV IgG in adults was not observed. Further studies are necessary in order to determine whether there may be regional differences in the KIPyV epidemiology. Taken together, the data of Kean et al. and of our study indicate that WUPyV and KIPyV have a widespread distribution similar to the well-known polyomaviruses BKV and JCV. Also in agreement with BKV and JCV epidemiology, primary exposure seems to occur mainly in childhood and youth. Primary BKV infection has been reported to occur mainly in the first decade of life leading to a seroprevalence of 65% to 90% at the age of 10 (reviewed in [20] ). The JCV seroprevalence in adults has been found between 44% and 97%. Whereas some studies reported a time frame for primary JCV infection similar to BKV infections, others showed a continuing rise of the JCV seroprevalence during adulthood (reviewed by [20] ). VP1 is the major capsid protein of polyomaviruses. Several studies on BKV and JCV serology have used this protein successfully in enzyme immunoassays, immunoblots, or IFA [21] [22] [23] [24] . Therefore, we decided to use expression of VP1 proteins to establish IFAs for the detection of WUPyV and KIPyV IgG. In the study by Kean et al., WUPyV and KIPyV antibodies were determined by an enzyme immunoassay based on bacterially expressed VP1 capsomeres [12] .",

The total number of adult samples tested was small in two of these reports (34, 7, and 299, respectively). Whether methodological issues or differences in the study populations account for the lower seroprevalence observed in this study, could be addressed by method comparisons and sample exchange. We chose the HBoV VP2 gene for recombinant expression on the basis of current knowledge about immunodominant antigens of parvovirus B19, which belongs to the same virus family as HBoV. Previous studies on HBoV serology have used IFA based on VP1expressing insect cells [15] , enzyme immunoassay based on VP2 purified from insect cells [17, 18] , immunoblot based on VP2 and the unique region of VP1 expressed in E. coli [16] , and enzyme immunoassay based on VP2 virus-like particles [19] . In the study of Kantola et al., a higher immunoreactivity was demonstrated for HBoV VP2 than for the unique part of HBoV VP1.
