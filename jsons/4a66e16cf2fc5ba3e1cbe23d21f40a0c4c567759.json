This highly contagious disease, COVID-19, was confirmed to be caused by a novel type of coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2. A recent preprint article with 8,866 cases reported the overall case fatality rate and the basic reproduction number (R0) to be 3.06% (95% CI 2.02-4.59) and 3.77 (95% CI 3.51-4.05), respectively. 1 It is urgent to cut transmission pathways and protect populations at risk. This raised great challenge for a country with such a large population and mobility at this timepoint of Spring Festival travel season. Here, we introduce some experience of community-based prevention and control from mainland China.",
