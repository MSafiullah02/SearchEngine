The specificity was controlled by western blotting using monoclonal antibodies against the nucleoprotein N and the glycoproteins G N and G C . G N * indicates oligomers of G N . (B) UUKV was labeled with a thiosulfate-activated fluorescent dye at a 1:5 molar ratio between UUKV glycoproteins and dye. The unlabeled (UUKV) and fluorescent particles (UUKV-RED) were analyzed by non-reducing (-dithiothreitol [DTT]) and reducing (+DTT) SDS-PAGE with blue staining (Coomassie) or fluorography (UV). The glycoproteins of UUKV-RED were the only fluorescently labeled proteins. In reducing conditions (DTT or TCEP), the fluorescent dye was completely removed. Note that contrary to non-reduced samples, G N and G C co-migrated in SDS-PAGE after reduction. (C) Confocal microscopy pictures of UUKV-RED show individual fluorescent spots of different intensities (1 to 3) with a diameter of 0.3 to 0.5 \u00b5m. (D) The distribution of the relative fluorescence intensity of one spot fits a Gaussian function (fit is calculated using the central limit theorem equation). The relative fluorescence intensity distributions for three different spots are shown (1 to 3). The distributions of the signal suggest that the light was emitted from single particles. (E) Unfixed UUKV-RED particles negatively stained with phosphotungstic acid under neutral pH conditions viewed by EM. Pictures show isolated particles. As already described for some other bunyaviruses (Schmaljohn and Nichol, 2007), the viruses appeared pleiomorphic in shape and homogenous in terms of size (132 +/-8 nm, n=8). (F) The fluorescent particles were as infectious as unlabeled particles. The titers of UUKV and UUKV-RED were normalized according to the amount of glycoproteins G N and G C (foci forming units [ffu] per \u00b5g of glycoproteins). Furthermore, we noticed no impact of 35 S-labeling on UUKV Figure S3. 35 S-virus-based internalization assay 35 S-labeled UUKV (m.o.i. ~3) was bound to cells on ice.
