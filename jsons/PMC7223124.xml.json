            "text": "Pulmonary atresia with ventricular septal defect (PA/VSD) is a congenital heart defect (CHD) characterized by discontinuity from the right ventricle (RV) to the pulmonary arteries (PAs), as well as a malaligned ventricular septal defect (VSD) caused by anterior displacement of the conal septum [1]. Except PA/VSD patients with major aortopulmonary collateral arteries (MAPCA), simple forms of PA/VSD have ductus-dependent pulmonary circulation requiring early surgical intervention. Surgical options for neonates and young infants with PA/VSD have been under debate. Early primary repairs guarantee the restoration of serial circulation, and may prevent progression of right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH). However, early primary repairs present increased risks of cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) for young and small patients as well as inevitable placement of a small RV-PA conduit, which necessitates early conduit replacement.",

            "text": "Furthermore, repair with aggressive manipulation of the thin and fragile neonatal pulmonary arterial structures may lead to frequent post-repair surgical or catheter re-intervention on the branch PAs. Initial palliation with staged repair enables neonates to defer the definitive operation until they can undergo repair with relatively lower risks of CPB-associated complications, and larger RV-PA conduit with prolonged durability can be used. However, high in-hospital [2] and inter-stage mortality [3\u20135] have been considered as caveats of the staged repair strategy. In this study, we sought to determine the impact of surgical strategies on overall survival and the incidence of post-repair re-interventions.",

There were 28 males, and prematurity (gestational age < 37 weeks) was present in 13 patients. The cohort was divided into two groups: group-SR, in which patients underwent staged repair after initial palliation (n = 50, 28 males), and group-PR, in which patients underwent primary repair (n = 15, nine males).

MBT shunts utilized a thoracotomy approach via the 4th intercostal space, and placement of the RV-PA conduit and central shunts were performed via full median sternotomy. For the shunt procedures, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) tube grafts (Gore-Tex vascular graft, W.L. Gore assoc. Inc, Elkton, MD) of appropriate size were used. The most commonly used shunt size was 3.5 mm (n = 37), followed by 4 mm (n = 8), and 3 mm (n = 1). For RV-PA conduit placement, 5\u20137 mm sized PTFE tube grafts were used. Additional palliative procedures prior to the repair were necessary for three patients: RV-PA conduit placement in two patients, and right MBT shunt in one patient. Excluding post-palliation in-hospital mortality (n = 3, 6%) and inter-stage mortality (n = 4, 8%), and staged Rastelli-type repair was performed in 43 patients at a median interval period of 9.4 months (IQR: 6.3\u201311.7 months) after initial palliation. Median age, body weight, and Nakata index at Rastelli-type repair was 10.1 months (IQR: 8.0\u201312.4 months), 8.0 kg (IQR: 7.2\u201310 kg), and 193 mm2/m2 (IQR: 153\u2013258 mm2/m2), respectively. Types of RV-PA conduit comprised non-valved PTFE conduit in 10, bovine jugular vein graft (Contegra; Medtronic, Inc, Minneapolis, Minn) in 10, Hancock valved conduit in 9, hand-made PTFE membrane-valved conduit [6] in 7, and miscellaneous in 3.
