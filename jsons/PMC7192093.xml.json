The presence of ACE2 protein in the lower respiratory tract and on the enterocytes in the small intestine suggested the possible entry of the virus.6 It has been confirmed that 2019-nCoV uses ACE2 to enter the host cell.7\n",

However, in mice mode, SARS-CoV mediated myocardial injury through ACE2 with a remarkable decreased expression of ACE231 and blocking renin-angiotensin pathway can attenuate the severity of lung injury.53 This result suggests the possible protective effect of ACEI/ARB in COVID-19 patients. Abrupt discontinuation of ACEI/ARB and switching to other antihypertensive drugs may result in adverse cardiac outcome. At present, clinical trials are recruiting patients to evaluate the safety and efficacy ACEI/ARB in COVID-19 patients. Guo2 demonstrated there was no difference in mortality among patients with or without the use of ACEI/ARB. Before more data are available, it is not wise to discontinue ACEI/ARB in patients with COVID-19.54\n",
