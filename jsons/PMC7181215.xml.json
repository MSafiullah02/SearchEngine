The balance between prooxidants and antioxidants is necessary for the normal homeostasis of cells and organisms. Oxidative stress plays an important role in many pathological processes, including viral infections, such as influenza [1]. Excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) cause oxidative damage of lipid membranes and mitochondrial respiratory chain. Mitochondria act as a platform for antiviral innate immunity. Mitochondrial antiviral signaling involves the activation of the retinoic acid-inducible gene I-like receptors, which requires oxidative phosphorylation activity. The cells with respiratory defects exhibited severely impaired virus-induced induction of interferons and proinflammatory cytokines. Mice with respiratory chain defects were highly susceptible to viral infection and exhibited significant lung inflammation [2]. Oxidative and nitrosative stress may also contribute to reduced antiviral immunity by altering the MDA-5/IRF-3/phosphoIRF-3 axis, as well as contributing to the mechanisms of inflammatory reaction via increased NF-kappaB, and to the augmented turnover rate of thymocyte cells via Bcl2/Bax up-regulation [3]. On the other hand, antiviral drugs may themselves exhibit genotoxic effects as a result of the excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) [4].",

The antiviral function of the antioxidant might also involves modulation of multiple signaling pathways/targets useful to viral replication [5]. In fact, many efficient antioxidants exhibit potent antiviral effect [6,7,8,9]. The efficiency of antiviral drugs can be increased in combination with some antioxidants. As an example, the in vitro synergistic antiviral effect of interferon alpha-2b in combination with unithiol on various variants of Herpes simplex was demonstrated [10]. A mixture of echinochrome A, ascorbic acid, and alpha-tocopherol (5:5:1) showed higher antioxidant and antiviral effects than echinochrome A [11]. The intraperitoneal injection of the natural antioxidant silymarin to mice neutralized genotoxic effects of Ribavirin towards mitochondrial DNA [4]. Silymarin also exhibited potent antiviral activity against Mayaro virus and reduced the levels of malondialdehyde and carbonyl protein, which are biomarkers of oxidative stress [12]. ",

Umifenovir is rapidly absorbed and distributed to organs and tissues. The maximum concentration in blood plasma after the administration of a single dose of 200 mg is about 415 ng/mL (approximately 0.9 \u03bcM) [15]. Umifenovir interacts with the hemagglutinin (HA) protein of influenza viruses, stabilizes it against the low pH transition to its fusogenic state, and it inhibits HA-mediated membrane fusion during influenza virus infection [16].",

Umifenovir inhibits various influenza A virus strains, including Rimantadine- and Ozeltamivir-resistant variants, as well as influenza B viruses (IC50 2\u20138.5 \u03bcg/mL), including pandemic influenza A/California/04/2009(H1N1), A/California/07/2009(H1N1), and A/Moscow/01/2009(H1N1)swl viruses in the cultured MDCK cells (IC50 = 1.5\u20134.0 \u03bcg/mL), highly pathogenic avian A(H5N1) viruses with EC50 ranging from 7.2 to 23.0 \u00b5M. The lungs of the mice that were treated with Umifenovir had less severe histopathologic lesions when compared to the control group [20]. Umifenovir possesses micromolar-level anti-viral effects (EC50 values that range from 10.57 +/\u2212 0.74 to 19.16 +/\u2212 0.29 \u00b5M) in Vero cells infected with Zika virus, West Nile virus, and tick-borne encephalitis virus. Therefore, Arbidol could be a promising therapeutic agent in the selective treatment of flaviviral infections [21]. The sensitivity to Umifenovir of influenza viruses circulating in the 2012\u20132014 seasons, as well as the sensitivity of influenza A virus isolated from patients, has been proven in the ARBITR study [18]. All 18 clinical isolates of influenza A viruses that were obtained before and during therapy were susceptible to Umifenovir with 50% effective concentration ranging from 8.4 +/\u2212 1.1 to 17.4 +/\u2212 5.4 \u03bcM without the development of drug-resistant variants [22].

Post-marketing surveillance of the efficiently of Umifenovir in clinical use was made by retrospective analyzed of 5287 patients with influenza and other ARVI in 88 hospitals from 50 regions of the Russian Federation. In patients that were treated with Umifenovir (in the first 48 h after disease onset), the duration of fever and frequency of pneumonia proved to be lower than those in the patients who did not receive antiviral therapy. Umifenovir therapy substantially reduces the duration of fever and risk of complications, especially in patients with laboratory-confirmed influenza infection [25]. ",

Arbidol-treated patients with lower baseline immunity showed improvement in immunological parameters (number of CD4, CD8 lymphocytes and B lymphocytes, and concentration of serum immunoglobulins). The administration of a single oral dose of Umifenovir 0.1 g by healthy adult volunteers resulted in the induction of serum interferon up to 40\u201380 interferon units/mL. For children, the administration of 0.01 g/kg/day leads to the 5.3-fold increase in the endogenous interferon production in 70% of subjects [28]. There is some evidence that Umifenovir helps the phagocytic action of macrophages [29]. The presence of not only direct antiviral action, but also other indirect effects was the reason for the investigation of antioxidant activity of Umifenovir.",

Weak antioxidants with low rate constants (for example, kIn = 10 nM\u22121min\u22121 in Figure 6a) do not give the latent period. Instead, the luminescence decreases slightly. The effect of weak antioxidants is prolonged, as they react very slowly.

            "text": "For Umifenovir, the chemiluminescence kinetics is more complicated (Figure 3a). First, immediately after the addition of the antioxidant, a significant but incomplete decrease in intensity occurs, which is typical for antioxidants of medium strength. Second, there is a stage of a slight decrease of the intensity of chemiluminescence with a slow and long rise of the luminescence to a stationary level, which is typical for weak antioxidants. Thus, a two-stage model is needed, which consists of two consequent antioxidant reactions with different rate constants. Figure 6b gives the examples of simulated plots for abstract antioxidants. The computer simulation confirmed the two-stage mechanism of the antioxidant effect of Umifenovir. The found rate constants 300 nM\u22121min.\u22121 and 4 nM\u22121min.\u22121 are characteristic for medium and weak antioxidant. Hence, from the kinetics point of view, Umifenovir can be classified as a medium antioxidant. The difference between the mechanisms of action for Trolox and Umifenovir makes it impossible to TRAP and TAR methodologies for the quantification of antioxidant capacity of Umifenovir. As a measure of antioxidant capacity, we propose using the total area of depression of the chemiluminescence, including \u201cfast\u201d and \u201cslow\u201d parts of the chemiluminograms. For 0.9 \u03bcM of Umifenovir, which corresponds to the maximal concentration in blood after oral administration of 200 mg, the Trolox-equivalent antioxidant capacity was as high as 1.65 \u03bcM. Hence, from the thermodynamic point of view, Umifenovir is a more effective antioxidant than Trolox in 1.65/0.9 = 1.8 times. Note that the effect of Umifenovir lasts for about an hour (Figure 4), while the effect of 0.9 \u03bcM Trolox lasts for about 12 minutes. Thus, Umifenovir acts five-fold longer than Trolox.",

Using a chemiluminescence system consisting of phospholipid liposomes, FeSO4, and coumarin C 525 in Tris buffer solution, they determined the antioxidant effect of Umifenovir on lipid peroxidation as a concentration of 50% depression (C50%) of amplitude of slow flash. This value (5 \u03bcM) was two orders of magnitude lower than C50% of \u03b1-tocopherol (0.06 \u03bcM). The authors attribute this fact to a poor solubility of Umifenovir in lipids. Note that, because of the comprehensive mechanism of lipid peroxidation, the amplitude of slow flash correlates with the antioxidant capacity in a complex way and it can only be used for semi-quantitative assessment. Measurements of the amplitude of the fast flash would be more adequate, but it was not possible with the chemiluminometer used by the authors. Based on the latent time of the slow flash, the authors proposed that the antioxidant effect of Umifenovir was due to the reaction with free radicals, but not with iron. However, these conclusions require confirmation by computer simulation, which may be the aim of the next study. In this study, we used 2,2\u2019-azobis(2-amidinopropane)hydrochloride, a well-known water soluble radical initiator, which has been successfully applied as an initiator of lipid peroxidation [36]. This substance forms the aliphatic carbon-centered radical, which is transformed into more reactive peroxyl radical in the presence of oxygen. It is considered to be a good model substance for ozone and UV-B exposure [37]. ABAP, as a radical generator, offers a useful tool for studying oxidative stress in biochemical and biological models and antioxidant properties of substances due to a simple chemical mechanism of the degradation and possibility to work at the physiological temperature. However, such studies can only be performed in aqueous phase, not in lipids.",
