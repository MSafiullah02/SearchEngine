The vaccine seems to be safe and effective and is desperately needed to prevent the 600 000 deaths annually that are attributed to rotavirus [1]. But its history underscores that, despite the profound role of vaccines in reducing human and animal morbidity and mortality, the field has relied on technological advances in other areas to spur its own development. In particular, the dual advances of genomic sequencing and microarray design have resulted in a renaissance of research in immunity and infectious diseases.",

In this review, we do not discuss technical aspects common to all arrays (e.g. statistical analysis and immobilization chemistry) because these are extensively reviewed elsewhere. Instead, we limit ourselves to novel applications in infection and immunity using four variants of array technology: DNA, antigen, peptide\u2013MHC complex (pMHC) and carbohydrate (Figure 1\n). Collectively, these technologies are already advancing our understanding of the interplay between immunity and disease, providing a rational basis for the design of vaccines and agents that interfere with disease progression (Table 1\n).",

The premise is that all coronaviruses will induce similar host responses, and these responses will be distinguishable from those induced by, for instance, bacterial sepsis. Thus, transcriptional profiling could be used to diagnose disease completely independent of any knowledge of the pathogen or even after the pathogen has been cleared from the system. Despite preliminary successes [32, 33, 34], this approach has met with several obstacles in terms of individual heterogeneity and strong stereotyped inflammatory responses mediated by the nuclear factor NF\u03ba-B, which obscure pathogen-specific responses [35, 36, 37].",

Proteins that either protect mice from subsequent challenge or induce sera that are protective in in vitro assays are pursued. First applied to serotype B Neisseria meningococcus, researchers ultimately queried a metagenomic database using sequence data from eight strains [44, 45]. Five antigens were identified; none of these was broadly protective alone but together they induced bactericidal antibodies in mice against 66 of 85 meningococcal strains [45].",

Instead of immunizing mice directly, proteins corresponding to the entire ORFeome (or fractionated lysate [47]) are spotted onto a glass slide. Na\u00efve, convalesent or immune sera are applied to the array, followed by a fluorescent secondary antibody (e.g. goat anti-mouse IgG). After washing, the array is scanned and fluorescence intensity is used to indicate the presence of antibodies that recognize the antigen immobilized in that spot (Figure 2). In this way, antigenic proteins can be rapidly recognized, the response of an individual to vaccination or infection monitored, and infections past and present diagnosed. Therapeutic monoclonal antibodies, destined for passive vaccination, can also be documented for cross-reactivity on a broad scale [48].",

Early successes include a vaccinia viral array consisting of 185 proteins that were probed using sera from na\u00efve and immunized mice, non-human primates and humans [56\u2022]. Interestingly, the three species did not recognize the same subsets of viral proteins. The array was later used to identify the H3L envelope protein as the immunodominant antigen in the live viral vaccine [57\u2022], perhaps paving the way for a less traumatic subunit vaccine. Similarly, a diagnostic array representing the entire ORFeome of SARS-CoV and portions of five additional coronaviruses was developed and tested using serum from 400 Canadian and 206 Chinese patients [58\u2022\u2022]. The array was shown to be at least as sensitive as and more specific than enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) tests for diagnosing SARS, requiring minimal sample processing compared with genome chips.",

Non-genetic approaches involve incubating synthetic peptides with antigen-presenting cells and T cells, with stimulatory peptides identified by interleukin 2 release [62]. Computational prediction methods, especially for class I MHC, are also improving but still require experimental validation [63].

Recent reports have devised strategies to achieve these goals by using pMHC arrays [65\u2022, 66, 67\u2022\u2022, 68]. In their current form, each feature on the array contains immobilized pMHC molecules, co-stimulatory antibodies and cytokine capture antibodies. Thus, a fluorescent T cell recognizing a particular pMHC will bind to the spot, be activated and secrete cytokines locally. These cytokines are captured and subsequently detected using fluorescent antibodies (Figure 2). Not only can the number of T cells bound to a spot be counted, replicating flow cytometry assays, but cellular responses can also be elucidated based on the cytokines released. Variations in design reveal the detailed consequences of binding to a single pMHC (using multicolor secondary antibodies to quantify levels of a series of cytokines) or to a peptide sequence (using arrays of peptide variants to identify agonist and antagonist peptides).",

            "text": "Carbohydrates consist of sugar units, including monosaccharides, disaccharides, oligosaccharides and polysaccharides, that can be linked to proteins as linear or branched extensions with varying connectivity. These molecules can profoundly affect protein folding and solubility, pathogen infection and immune system responses [72] and can form the basis of several vaccines (e.g. Haemophilus influenzae type b) [73]. However, because of their intrinsic heterogeneity and non-template-driven biosynthesis, identifying and characterizing the linkage of sugar groups, for example by HPLC of enzymatically released carbohydrates, has been difficult. Recent and ongoing development of glycan arrays has been motivated largely by the Consortium for Functional Glycomics (http://www.functionalglycomics.org/) and has been made possible by several technical breakthroughs, including advances in carbohydrate immobilization [74, 75, 76, 77, 78].",

A rare and potently neutralizing antibody, 2G12, protects against viral challenge in vivo in animal models of HIV infection, by binding terminal Man \u03b11-2Man residues on gp120 [92]. Carbohydrate arrays have been developed to characterize the affinity and structural specificity of 2G12 mannose recognition compared with other mannose-binding or gp120-binding proteins to develop a carbohydrate template for HIV vaccine design [81\u2022, 93, 94]. With influenza A viruses, arrays have probed the basis of species specificity \u2014 a crucial aspect when evaluating serotypes for pandemic potential. The virus invades cells by hemagglutinin binding to cell surface sialic acid residues, which vary in structure based on the host species and anatomical location. Binding of hemagglutinin variants recovered from pandemic and circulating strains on a 260-member glycan array demonstrated differences in recognition of carbohydrate linkages (\u03b12-3 or \u03b12-6, characteristic of avian and human viruses, respectively), fucosylation and sulfation. Interestingly, a single amino acid change (Asp255Gly) in the pandemic 1918 H1 was found to switch specificity from exclusively \u03b12-6 to mixed specificity, whereas Asp190Glu conferred complete reversion [95\u2022\u2022, 96].",

Such methods include those borrowed from structural genomics (e.g. tags for purification and immobilization [113]) and those that generate proteins directly from DNA (e.g. spotted viral or cell particles that present the protein of interest on their surface [55, 114], in vitro transcription and translation of spotted transcriptionally active DNA to produce and directly capture expressed protein [56\u2022, 115], and spotted lentiviral arrays to directly transfect overlaid eukaryotic cells [116]).2.A second important area of development is movement into the array format of technologies that have expanded capabilities compared with most current arrays, which measure binding under near-equilibrium conditions [117]. Newer formats can extract kinetic (e.g. the BIAcore flexchip), force (e.g. Bioforce Nanosciences) [118, 119] or thermodynamic [120] parameters associated with the interaction, permitting rigorous quantitative comparisons and providing mechanistic insight.3.A third approach involves high-throughput array-based analysis of additional post-translational modifications, such as phosphorylation [121] and lipidation [122, 123].\n",

(i) Immobilized DNA sequences can be chosen to represent highly conserved regions from a broad range of organisms, as in the pan Virochip, and used for disease diagnosis. Alternatively, the DNA chosen can be more specialized, detecting clinically relevant genes (e.g. antibiotic resistance and export pump genes, key antigens for serotyping and virulence factors capable of horizontal transmission). Sample nucleic acids are purified, fluorescently labelled and allowed to specifically hybridize with immobilized complementary DNA. (ii) Use of resequencing arrays provides single base pair information, which is useful when tracking genetic drift and single nucleotide polymorphisms. (b) Antigen arrays to monitor humoral immunity. Open reading frames (or peptides) from a genome are expressed recombinantly, purified and immobilized in an array. Serum from an infected, recovered or vaccinated individual is incubated with the array; bound antibodies are detected by subsequent incubation with a fluorescently labeled secondary antibody. These arrays can be used to rapidly characterize the protective immunome of an organism, to identify novel vaccine candidates and to compare vaccine-induced humoral responses with those resulting from natural infection. (c) pMHC arrays to monitor cellular immunity. A variety of soluble peptide\u2013MHC (pMHC) complexes are immobilized with co-stimulatory antibodies to form an array of artificial antigen-presenting cells. Fluorescently labeled T cell populations can be incubated with the array to quantify the fraction specific for a given pMHC. Additionally, antibodies can be co-deposited with the pMHC to capture locally secreted cytokines in a sandwich assay (illustrated here for interleukin 10 and interferon\u2013\u03b3). The nature of the cytokines released reveals the responses of the T cells to stimulation with a particular pMHC. Using secondary antibodies with different fluorescent labels, the assay can be multiplexed to detect multiple cytokines simultaneously. (d) Glycoarrays and lectin arrays. Monosaccharides, oligosaccharides and polysaccharides of varying sequence and structure, in addition to glycoproteins and lectins, are immobilized in an array. Fluorescently labeled proteins, viruses or bacterial cells are applied to the array to assess their carbohydrate-binding specificity; for example, the species specificity of bird and human influenza variants can be attributed to the glycan-binding propensitites of the respective hemagglutinin variants. In the case of lectin arrays, these arrays can rapidly assess the nature of the glycans attached to the protein or cell surface.",
