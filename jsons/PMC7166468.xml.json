Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human metapneumovirus (HMPV) are two common causes of ALRTI; these two viruses are negative sense single\u2010stranded RNA viruses belonging to the pneumovirinae subfamily of the family Paramyxoviridae. RSV belongs to genus pneumovirus and is the leading cause of ALRTI [Rudan et al., 2013]; it is estimated that 68.8% of children aged <1 year and 82.6% of children aged <2 years are infected with RSV [Glezen et al., 1986]. Globally, RSV results in 33.8 million new episodes ALRTI in children aged <5 years and results in at least 3.4 million cases of severe disease [Nair et al., 2010]. HMPV belongs to the genus metapneumovirus and was first found in 2001, retrospective serological studies have found that HMPV antibodies in humans have existed more than 50 years [van den Hoogen et al., 2001]. In children aged <5 years, the hospitalization rate associated with HMPV is one per 1,000 children [Edwards et al., 2013].",

Children were diagnosed in three groups: bronchitis, pneumonia, and bronchiolitis. The diagnostic criteria of pneumonia was based on Defining pneumonia in critically ill infants and children [Langley and Bradley, 2005], and the diagnostic criteria of bronchiolitis was based on diagnosis and management of bronchiolitis [American Academy of Pediatrics Subcommittee on Diagnosis and Management of Bronchiolitis, 2006]. There has no definite and strict diagnostic criteria for bronchitis, the main signs are cough, expectoration. Bronchitis is not associated with constitutional symptoms and other signs such as tachypnea, hypoxemia, and so on. Auscultatory findings of bronchitis consist of coarse crackles, medium crackles, and slight wheezes. The definition of disease severity was based on strategy to enhance influenza surveillance worldwide [Ortiz et al., 2009]. For children >5 years old, all of the following four items must be required: (i) Sudden onset of fever >38\u00b0C, (ii) Cough or sore throat, (iii) Shortness of breath (breathing faster than 25 breaths/min) or difficult breathing, (iv) Requires hospitalization. For children \u22645 years old, with cough or difficult breathing and at least one sign or symptom of follows: (i) Shortness of breath: breathing faster than 60 breaths/min (infants <2 months), breathing faster than 50 breaths/min (2\u201312 months), breathing faster than 40 breaths/min (1\u20135 years), (ii) Unable to drink or breastfeed, (iii) Vomits everything, (iv) Convulsions, (v) Lethargic or unconscious, (vi) Chest indrawing or stridor in a calm child.",

This study found that 94.57% patient samples had at least one detectable potential viral pathogen; this detection rate was significantly higher than previous studies (48.1\u201390%) that used traditional PCR or direct immunofluorescence [Singleton et al., 2010; Ahmed et al., 2012; Bicer et al., 2013; Bukhari and Elhazmi 2013] and was higher than a German study that used real\u2010time PCR (detecting 14 viruses with a result of 78% positive) [Franz et al., 2010]. It is possible that the detection rate in this study could be due to the increased sensitivity of real\u2010time PCR compared to conventional PCR and viral culture methods. This study also detected 14 different viruses, the viral pathogen spectrum was more comprehensive than many previous studies (7\u201312 viruses) [Singleton et al., 2010; Ahmed et al., 2012; Bicer et al., 2013; Bukhari and Elhazmi, 2013]. Additionally patients in this study all were diagnosed with ALRTI, and in many instances, the patients were suffering from severe disease. Meerhoff et al. [2010] indicated that using NPA resulted in a higher detection rate than using a nasal swab as a sample, it is possible that the use of NPA might also be associated with the higher rate of detection seen in this study. Finally, other factors such as race and geographical conditions may have some influence on the viral burden in the population, and thus the detection rate.",

Similar to other studies [Franz et al., 2010; Singleton et al., 2010; Bicer et al., 2013; Bukhari and Elhazmi, 2013], RSV was the most common virus in children with ALRTI [Franz et al., 2010; Singleton et al., 2010; Bicer et al., 2013; Bukhari and Elhazmi, 2013].

Previous studies have demonstrated that cold exposure may increase the possibility of bronchoconstriction, airway congestion, secretion, and decrease innate immune mechanisms such as mucocialiary clearance [Giesbrecht, 1995]. This indicates that cold seasons may increase the risk of respiratory infections. In this study, RSV showed a clear seasonal distribution in winter\u2010spring. In contrast, the maximum prevalence was observed in March to August in Singapore and Brazil, but in September to November in Malaysia which also located in tropical zone [Chew et al., 1998; Pecchini et al., 2008; Khor et al., 2012]. There was no significant seasonality of HMPV observed in this study, but in studies performed in Korea and Turkey, the peak season was winter\u2010spring [Kim et al., 2010; Bicer et al., 2013]. These observations suggest that not all respiratory virus infection is common in cold seasons. The seasonality of viruses was different in different regions; this may correlate with local geographical and climatic features.",

[2007] also found that nasopharyngeal RSV loads were higher in patients with severe disease. In contrast, clinical aspects observed in patients with serious LRTIs, like respiratory rate, cyanosis, and hospitalization were not associated with high viral loads. We also analyzed the relationship between severity and viral load using multiple linear regression, the viral load showed no apparent significant difference between severe and not severe disease groups in this study. These findings are in agreement with previous studies indicating that RSV viral load may have no correlation with the disease severity [Wright et al., 2002; Jansen et al., 2010]. However, in this study, RSV viral load was significantly different between three diagnostic groups and a high RSV viral load may be a risk factor of developing bronchiolitis. Excluding severity and underlying diseases, Children aged <1 year had a higher viral load than other children. It is possible that this is due to the children aged <1 year having an immature immune system resulting in an inappropriate shift toward a Th2 immune response to RSV infection [Gerna et al., 2008]. In our study, days of illness <14 days had a higher viral load compared with \u226514 days for RSV, this was because the long days of illness may associated with co\u2010infecting, this also consistent with the result in our study that children positive for RSV alone had a higher viral load than co\u2010infected with other viruses.",

These studies also showed a significant correlation between HMPV viral load and disease severity. In contrast, our study showed no correlation between viral load and disease severity, this was consistent with a previous study conducted in Chongqing, China [Peng et al., 2010], which also indicated that HMPV viral load was significant correlated with the course of illness; high viral load occurred between 6 and 11 days post\u2010infection.",

However, this is consistent with the overall higher detection rate in observed this study as mentioned above. In this study, children infected with RSV alone had a higher viral load than in RSV patients co\u2010infected with other viruses; this observation was not seen with HMPV and reflects in part an observation made by Franz et al. [2010]. Martin et al. [2012] showed that the correlation between viral load and viral co\u2010infection was virus specific and in their study, both RSV and HMPV were present at consistently high viral loads regardless of whether the patient was co\u2010infected with another virus. The effect of co\u2010infection on disease RSV or HMPV disease severity remains unclear and controversial. Semple et al. [2005] found dual infection by HMPV and RSV was associated with severe bronchiolitis, while other studies have found no association of co\u2010infection with disease severity [Peng et al., 2009] or co\u2010infection was correlated with less severe disease [Martin et al., 2012]. In our study, the incidence of severe disease was similar between single infections and co\u2010infections, indicating that co\u2010infection was not associated with more severe disease. An immune response to the first virus infection might alter the disease severity of a subsequently virus by the induction of interferon and other anti\u2010viral response modifiers [Martin et al., 2012]. The impact of these immunomodulators could be to restrain colonization and pathogenicity of the co\u2010infecting virus. However, more research is needed to determine what the relationship between co\u2010infecting viruses and disease development is.",

Furthermore, viral loads of many viruses in healthy children remain unknown; a control group of healthy children should be established in order to determine the basal viral load level to help determine loads associated with increased disease risk. In addition, follow\u2010up examinations should be performed, to more accurately reflect the correlation between viral load and changing disease progression and severity.",
