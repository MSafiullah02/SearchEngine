First of all, it is not true that at conferences most attendees are passively sit in continuous medical education sessions: nowadays most sessions are allowing a good interaction, and thus the choice of being proactive is in the hand of participants. Also, it is not correct that speakers are talking more or less intelligibly on a stage in the far distance; in my experience the audio quality at every congress centre is far better that quality of streaming webinar audio, and we frequently see empty seats at front row, thus the distance can be easily reduced.",

Although a speech or a presentation can be viewed by an unlimited number of the people, streaming video only facilitate one-way communication. For multiway communication to occur, online meetings should allow attendees to interact and ask questions; however, web conferencing can only accommodate a limited number of people, and at present tens or hundreds of attendees cannot interact together effectively [2] .",

The only strategy to improve the quality of presentation is carefully selecting the speakers and interact with them to promote maximum efforts to provide a great talk, that is exactly what a Congress Chair is expected to do, either in a physical or virtual conference. And the presence of few attendees (proverbially or literally, three people) is not related to the type of event, but only to the interest raised by the session and talk. Going virtual, it is unlikely to magically make all speakers of outstanding quality; and the number of attendees could probably be increased simply because some guys may connect and then doing other stuff, while leaving the streaming running not listened.",

However, it fully remains in the hand of our personal choice to accept invitation for a talk or declining it: if a colleague that I invite as Congress Chair to Vienna from Australia would not come for the benefit of the reduction of travel pollution, I can surely understand, and eventually find an alternative speaker from a nearby area. Furthermore, international virtual meetings would depend on attendees in different time zones gathering online. A single time cannot oblige every time zone, and organizers are sure to lose those who live in regions where the online meeting occurs at inconvenient times [2] .",

All these opportunities are frequently referred as \"networking\" but such word is very reductive: best targeted network can probably be done via web, for example, via Twitter you can easily reach thousand followers without moving from home; nonetheless we are to every extent very social animals, preferring real smiles over emoticons, and the \"human inperson networking\" is the true added value of a conventional Congress.",

I am surely stupid and old style, but the pleasure of attending a party with residents and colleagues from five continents fully compensate the rush for meetings and sessions, and motivate me to come back the next year. Of course, those considerations are true for a Congress with an excellent balance of high scientific content and great mood, and this is exactly what we are aimed at keeping high at EANM: the momentum, namely the possibility to enjoy the entire event, by any point of view.",
