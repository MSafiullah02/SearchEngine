Congenital portosystemic shunts are single (almost always) large-caliber connections between the portal vein and systemic veins. A congenital shunt can be intrahepatic or extrahepatic in location. Intrahepatic congenital shunts, often attributable to a patent ductus venosus, occur most often in large-breed dogs. Extrahepatic congenital shunts, which occur in small-breed dogs more often than the intrahepatic shunts, may connect the portal vein to any of several veins, including the splenic, azygous, or renal vein, or to the caudal vena cava.",

The preferred term proposed by the WSAVA Liver Study Group is portal vein hypoplasia. Portal vein hypoplasia is a congenital vascular anomaly that occurs in dogs, and occasionally in cats, in which the intrahepatic vein and, in some circumstances, the extrahepatic portal vein are abnormally small or absent. The abnormally small or absent extrahepatic vein or intrahepatic portal vein results in diminished hepatic perfusion. There is potential for portal hypertension, along with ascites and the formation of acquired shunt vessels because of the restricted intrahepatic portal blood flow. These alterations can be present early in the course of the disease or may develop over time or not at all. Affected animals have small livers and the typical histologic pattern of portal vein hypoperfusion. It is important to remember that this condition differs from portosystemic shunts, because there is no abnormal connection between the portal vein and systemic venous system.",

Affected areas of the liver contain a convoluted hepatic artery branch and an aneurysmal portal vein branch with abnormal thickened walls.

It is likely that chronic hepatitis has many possible causes that may include infectious, autoimmune, drug-induced, and copper-associated causes. Copper-associated hepatitis, the most well-characterized form of chronic hepatitis, is discussed in more detail elsewhere in this article. Chronic hepatitis is characterized by hepatocellular apoptosis or necrosis, a variable mononuclear or mixed inflammatory infiltrate, regeneration, and fibrosis (Fig. 16\n). The proportion and distribution of these components vary widely. It is desirable for the pathologist to provide a subjective evaluation of the activity and stage of the disease to facilitate comparison among cases. The activity of the disease is determined by the amount of inflammation and extent of hepatocellular apoptosis and necrosis. The stage of the disease, and the prognosis, may be determined by the extent and pattern of fibrosis and the possible presence of architectural distortion. Fibrosis may be portoportal, portocentral, or centrocentral bridging, or it may dissect the lobule. Fibrosis may occur associated with interface hepatitis (inflammation extending from the portal tract and through the limiting plate) after parenchymal collapse with condensation of the residual reticulin network or by means of activation of hepatic stellate cells or related myofibroblasts, which synthesize collagen in the perisinusoidal space or in the portal tracts and around the central veins, respectively. Hepatocellular regeneration and regenerative nodules of hepatic parenchyma are often seen, in addition to proliferation of ductular structures at the periphery of the parenchyma and within fibrous septa.

The borders of the lesions are generally well delineated from the adjacent hepatic parenchyma, although the border is frequently irregular because of local invasion. Areas of necrosis can be found in the central regions. The tumors are composed of cells that can be quite pleomorphic but usually retain a resemblance to biliary epithelium. Characteristically, well-differentiated carcinomas are organized into a tubular or acinar arrangement (Fig. 23\n). In less well-differentiated neoplasms, some acinar arrangements can be detected among solid masses of neoplastic cells. Mucin is frequently evident in the lumen of well-differentiated areas of the tumors. The epithelial components of the neoplasms are usually separated by abundant fibrous connective tissue, termed a scirrhous response. Metastasis to extrahepatic sites is common.",

They are believed to arise from neuroendocrine cells that lie within the intra- or extrahepatic biliary epithelium ductular tree, gallbladder, or, possibly, hepatic progenitor cells. Often, they form a single mass, but multiple nodules can occur, probably secondary to intrahepatic metastasis. They tend to have an aggressive course, and extrahepatic metastasis can occur. Cells tend to be small, elongated, or spindle shaped and form ribbons or rosettes, and the tumors are highly vascular (Fig. 24\n). Immunohistochemical detection of neuroendocrine markers, such as chromogranin A or neuron-specific enolase, may be used to confirm the diagnosis in some cases, but there are no definitive markers.",
