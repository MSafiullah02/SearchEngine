BEECS undertook a baseline survey of its members after the initial response from the RCOphth 16/3/20 mirroring Public Health England (PHE) advice and a follow-up survey after the guidance was updated on 9/4/20. A combined total of 84 responses were received. Improvements after RCOphth changes between the two surveys from hospital respondents showed increases in temperature screening (13%), scrub use (34%), use of aprons (31%), masks (4%), eye protection (35%), gloves (25%) and slit lamp guard (1%). Our findings demonstrate a positive and significant adaptation of PPE in response to change in guidance published by PHE, RCOphth and BEECS between 16/3/20 and 11/4/20. The COVID19 pandemic has rapidly taken over the normal activity of Ophthalmic departments creating unprecedented challenges.
