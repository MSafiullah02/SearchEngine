This novel coronavirus has various names: 2019-nCoV (according to the World Health Organization) and SARS-CoV-2 (according to the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses). The disease that this virus causes has been called 2019-nCoV. 1 On the 7th of January 2020, the novel coronavirus was officially announced by Chinese authorities as the causal agent of these infections. 1 The coronaviruses are enveloped in nonsegmented positive-sense RNA that belong to the Coronaviridae family and Nidovirales order and are widely distributed among humans and mammals, causing numerous conditions that range from the ''common'' influenza to death. 2 As of the 13th of February 2020, several cases have been recorded. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there have been 46,997 cases reported worldwide, 46,550 of which (99.04%) have been confirmed in China. Of these, 1368 (2.93%) resulted in death, thereby categorizing this disease as a worldwide public health emergency. 3, 4 The following link provides a real-time updated map on the worldwide situation of cases of coronavirus, with incidence rates and locations: https://gisanddata. maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html -/bda 7594740fd40299423467b48e9ecf6.",

To date, the alpha and beta types have been determined to infect humans, 5 causing diseases ranging from the common cold to more severe conditions, such as Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), which caused thousands of deaths in 2002. 6, 7 Four of the human coronaviruses (HCoV 229E, NL63, OC43 and HKU1) are endemic worldwide and represent 10---30% of upper respiratory tract infections in adults. 5 Structurally, coronaviruses are spherical or pleomorphic, with diameters of 80---120 nm. Various electronic microscope analyses have identified the surface of the virion, discovering that they are structures organized by projections that in turn consist of viral spike (S) glycoprotein trimers. 8 Additionally, other short projections composed of hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) protein dimers have been identified, which have been observed in some beta-coronaviruses. 9 For its part, the viral envelope is reinforced by the membrane (M) glycoprotein (the most abundant on the virion's surface), which is found embedded in the membrane by 3 transmembrane domains. 10 Another structural component of the virion is the envelope (E) protein, a small protein that is highly hydrophobic and is found to a small proportion than the other proteins. 11 The viral proteins of the coronavirus are embedded in a lipid membrane that is created by the infected cells. Internally, the virus particle consists of an additional protein known as the nucleoprotein (N), which binds to the virus RNA in a helical structure similar to a beaded string, thereby protecting the RNA from degradation (Fig. 1A) . 8 The genome of coronaviruses is positive-polarity, singlestrand nonsegmented RNA (+ssRNA), which measures 27 to 32 kilobases. The genomic RNA presents certain changes such as polyadenylations in the 3' terminal region; in contrast, the 5' terminal region contains a cap structure. 12 Within this RNA, there are numerous open reading frames (6---11 ORFs). The first ORF encodes approximately 16 nonstructural proteins, while the remaining ORFs encode accessory and nonstructural proteins (Fig. 1B) . 13 The genome sequence analyses for 2019-nCoV were fairly similar to those of SARS-CoV; however, there are certain differences such as the lack of the region encoding for protein 8 a in 2019-nCoV, which could therefore have resulted in its lower pathogenesis when compared with SARS-CoV. 14 ",

Due to the close similarity between 2019-nCoV and bat coronaviruses, it is likely that bats are the main reservoir for the virus. Various studies were conducted when this new class of coronavirus appeared and discovered that 2019-nCoV is 96% identical to a bat coronavirus at the genome level. The same study revealed that this virus belongs to the SARS-CoV species. 15 Thus, it was speculated that SARS-CoV was transmitted to humans from exotic animals in markets in the outbreak 18 years ago, 15 while MERS-CoV was transmitted from camels to humans. 16 The reports documented that many of the first identified patients share the common factor of contact with a seafood and animal market; however, other patients had no contact with these locations at any time, which shows the limited person-to-person infection after identifying groups of The virus consists of a nucleocapsid, which in turn is composed of (+)ssRNA and the nucleoprotein.

Transmission therefore mainly occurs from patients with a recognized disease and not from patients with mild and nonspecific signs; in other words, it is believed that propagation occurs only after the patient shows signs of the disease in the lower respiratory tract. 22, 23 However, patients with 2019-nCoV infection detected in a severe or fatal state have a greater probability of transmitting this virus, given that they expel a greater quantity of infectious particles than patients who have the mild or asymptomatic form of the infection. Identifying and quarantining these patients in health centers where outbreaks have occurred, along with the implementation of appropriate infection control and constant reports on cases from various countries, have been effective in reducing the transmission and containing outbreaks of the disease. 24 The mean number of new cases that a case of coronavirus generates over the course of its infectious period (R 0 ) varies between 2.24 (95% CI 1.96---2.55) and 3.58 (95% CI 2.89---4.39), 21 i.e., one individual can infect approximately 2 to 4 people, which means that the infection can propagate rapidly and widely among the population (Fig. 2) .",

The novel coronavirus can infect people of all ages, although the elderly and those with pre-existing medical conditions (such as asthma, diabetes and heart disease) seem to be most vulnerable to falling seriously ill with the virus. Thus, the reported mortality rate for individuals older than 70 years is >8%. According to reports, the patients who died of this infection had a mean age of 56 years, and most had other diseases (heart disease, stroke, diabetes, etc.), which could have made them more vulnerable to the virus. The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention reported that 1 to 2 men were infected for every woman. It has been speculated that women's low susceptibility to the viral infections could be due to protection from their ''extra'' X chromosome. 25 Children constitute a peculiar population with an immune system different from that of adults. Virus transmission through their mothers with suspected or confirmed infection, therefore, occurs easily. 26 However, a lower severity and extremely low mortality has been observed.",
