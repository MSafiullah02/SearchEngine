            "text": "Notes on these criteria:\n\nAs simple and flexible as possible.Complexity and inflexibility are incompatible with surveillance systems generally and particularly when operating in emergencies where collection of data may be difficult and where situations can change very fast.\nAppropriate in terms of the information required.Defining what you \u201cneed to know\u201d will allow you to set up the appropriate data collection methods (questionnaires, sites, etc.) to design the system so that it can obtain and handle the information required.\nCapable of providing such information in a timely manner.Information that is accurate but out of date is useless for immediate disease control purposes and of little value for immediate forward planning. Effective communications therefore form an integral part of any surveillance system.\nAppropriate in terms of the resources available.Do not try to overreach when setting up a system. For example, expatriate staff may best be used to recruit local staff for the system and in supervisory activities rather than in collecting data.\nSustainable in the long term within local resources.This criterion is certainly a goal to aim for as sustainability must be the target for all aid work. However, there may be situations where an emergency system is needed rapidly and where it cannot readily be integrated into existing systems or be developed as a new long-term system.\nBased on standardised sampling methods.The sampling system must use the same data collection methods throughout if data are to be comparable. Ideally this should be methods that are internationally agreed and approved. Agreement should be sought for the methods from the other agencies on the ground to ensure consistency.\nBased on agreed case definitions.Without case definitions that are agreed by all parties, the likelihood of success of a surveillance system is very low. This is especially so when laboratory support is minimal or absent since clinical case definitions have to be drawn very tightly if different diseases are not to be confused.\nCapable of providing regular information from defined sites.Routine surveillance requires more than material from ad hoc sources. Sites such as medical centres (in towns, villages or camps for displaced persons), hospitals and/or public health units should be recruited.\nCapable of covering the whole affected area.The more comprehensive is the coverage of the system, the more likely is it that the data will be accurate and complete and that problems will not be missed. Such coverage can be problematic. The coverage of the different systems that can be used is discussed in the following points.\nCompatible with existing systems.The data that is collected and the methods used should ideally fit in with systems that are operating or have previously operated in the area.\nUse existing systems as far as possible.Following from criterion 10, if systems are already in existence or in abeyance but revivable, then this should be done (rather than set up an entirely new system) so as to improve the likelihood that local health-care services will be willing to be involved in the system you are proposing and also ensure continuity of data collection and analysis.\nUse existing records as far as possible.Existing records are of considerable value for predictive purposes. Knowledge of past problems makes it possible to anticipate future problems and trends and allows for early planning decisions.\nInvolve collaboration between agencies so as to avoid duplication.If several health agencies are operating, it is essential to ensure collaboration between them in surveillance activities to avoid confusion and duplication of effort.\nInvolve collaboration with local services so as to avoid duplication.As previously noted, early involvement of local health and surveillance services will reduce workloads and avoid duplication of effort.\nAcceptable to those surveyed.If those from whom the data is collected, those who are collecting the data and those who will receive the results are unhappy with the system, the system is unlikely to operate effectively.\n",

CMR is usually expressed as number of deaths per 10,000 persons per day. If the CMR rises above 1/10,000/day (>2/10,000/day for young children), an acute emergency is developing and the emergency phase lasts until the daily CMR falls to 1/10,000/day or below.\nAge-specific mortality rate (number of deaths in individuals of a specific age due to a specific cause/defined number of individuals of that age/day). In children this is usually given as the number of deaths in children under and over 5 years old/1,000 children of each age/day. NB: If population data for the under 5 s is not available, an estimate of 17 % of the total population may be used.\nMaternal mortality rate. Maternal mortality is a sensitive indicator of the effectiveness of health-care systems. A maternal death is usually defined as the death of a woman whilst pregnant or within 42 days of the termination of the pregnancy (for whatever cause) from any cause related to or aggravated by the pregnancy or its management. The 42 days cut-off is recommended by WHO, but some authorities use a time of up to a year.\nMaternal mortality rate = (number of deaths from puerperal causes in a specified area in a year /number of live births in the area during the same year) \u00d7 1,000 (or \u00d7 100, 000).\nCause-specific death rates (case fatality rates).

This is primarily a surveillance tool that will reduce the inclusion of cases that are not part of the outbreak and prevent dilution of the focus and activities of the main control effort.Collect and analyse descriptive data by time, person and place (time and date of onset, individual characteristics of those affected \u2013 age, sex, occupation, etc., location of cases). Plot maps of case distribution (can locate source(s) of an outbreak and determine spread) and plot outbreak curves (which will help estimate of how the outbreak is evolving).Determine the population that is at risk.Determine the number of cases and the size of the affected population. Calculate the attack rate.Formulate hypotheses for the pathogen about the possible source and routes of transmission.Conduct detailed epidemiological investigations to identify modes of transmission, vectors/carriers and risk factors.Analyse data, report results and make recommendations for action.\n",

The statistical tests available include t-tests, ANOVA, nonparametric statistics, cross tabulations and stratification with estimates of odds ratios, risk ratios, and risk differences, logistic regression (conditional and unconditional) and survival analysis (Kaplan Meier and Cox proportional hazard).
