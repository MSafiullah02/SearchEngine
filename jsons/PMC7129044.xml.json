Attention was paid to complete the examination of the blood samples, especially the counting of thrombocytes, within 30 min, and the EDTA-tubes were carefully checked for small blood clots. For all cats, the platelets were counted microscopically using Thrombo Plus-tubes (Sarstedt, N\u00fcmbrecht) and a Neubauer counting chamber (Moritz and Hoffmann 1997). Further testing included coagulation testing (prothrombin time by Hepato Quick, Boehringer, Mannheim; partial thromboplastin time by Pathromtin, Dade Behring, Marburg) and serological tests (eg, feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) antibodies, feline leukaemia virus (FeLV) antigen, coronavirus antibodies). In certain cases, a direct Coombs\u2019 test (n\n = 21) and anti-nuclear antibody testing (one case) were performed, and cytological (15) and histological (nine) tests were done. In 39 cats, radiography of thorax and abdomen and/or abdominal ultrasound were performed.",

Thus, particles having the same size as platelets (eg, fragments of red blood cells) can be distinguished from thrombocytes and excluded from the analysis. Fluorescein-conjugated polyclonal goat anti-feline IgG antibodies (heavy and light chains) (Dianova, Hamburg) were used to detect those platelets that were carrying antibodies.

For detection of anti-megakaryocytic antibodies direct and indirect immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry have been described (Joshi et al., 1979, Tasker et al., 1999). In this study, flow cytometry was used for direct PBA testing in cats.

In one study, Lewis et al (1995a) compared mean fluorescence of platelets of healthy dogs (n\n = 5) after 0, 24, 48, and 72 h after storage on ice or at room temperatures. Concentrations of PBA were increased significantly after storage at room temperatures, while concentrations of IgG on thrombocytes that had been stored on ice were not increased significantly. In our semi-blind study (the investigating laboratory had no knowledge of the clinical situation of the blood donor), none of the healthy control cats, the blood of which was treated in the same fashion as that of the sick cats, tested positive. False-negative results can be caused by the antibodies decreasing due to immunosuppressive therapy, by antibodies being too low at the onset, and due to technical problems (eg, using wrong antibodies) (Campbell et al., 1984, Kristensen et al., 1994a).",

            "text": "Clinical studies evaluating the causes for thrombocytopenia in cats are infrequently found in the literature (Jordan et al., 1993, Peterson et al., 1995, Thomas and Green, 1998). In our group of 42 cats, 33.3% (14/42) of the thrombocytopenic cats suffered from viral infectious diseases: 16.6% suffered from FIP, 7.1% from FeLV, and 9.5% from FIV. In Jordan et al (1993) only 4.9% cats had FIP, but 14.6% had FeLV infection. The mechanisms associated with thrombocytopenia during a viral infection may be multifactorial and vary with the agent (Weiss 2000). According to Axthelm and Krakowa (1987), virus induced thrombocytopenia may be caused by inhabiting precursor cells, thus reducing megakaryocytopoiesis, direct platelet damage or lysis by the virus itself, removal of platelets by the mononuclear phagocytic system, or by disseminated intravascular coagulation. Three of the seven cats suffering from feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) were PBA test positive, suggesting immune-mediated destruction of the platelets as a contributing factor. However, these cats also suffered from anaemia and leukopenia (pancytopenia), indicating a decreased bone marrow production as well. Two of the three cats infected with FeLV and two out of four cats infected with FIV had positive PBA test results, and an immune-mediated destruction of thrombocytes was considered a possible pathological mechanism.",

Strikingly, all of the four cats suffering from fat necrosis were positive for PBA. Seven percent of the cats suffered from a bacterial infection. In inflammatory disease states interactions of platelets with altered or damaged endothelial surfaces cause extensive platelet activation, clumping, and removal of platelets by the mononuclear phagocytic system. Platelet destruction in bacterial infections can occur as a result of platelet adherence or aggregation to activated monocytes or neutrophils. Exotoxins may directly damage platelets and contribute to thrombocytopenia (Bithell, 1993, Russell and Grindem, 2000). A positive direct PBA test was also described in dogs suffering from ehrlichiosis, babesiosis, leishmaniasis, and various bacterial infections (abscess, prostatitis) (Lewis et al., 1995a, Kohn et al., 2000a). Therefore, in dogs as well as in cats immune-mediated destruction might contribute to thrombocytopenia in different infectious diseases.",

In Jordan et al (1993), lymphoma or leukaemia were present in 31.7% of the cats. There is a wide variety of pathomechanisms that may cause thrombocytopenia in the course of a neoplastic disease: Platelets may be sequestered in the spleen, liver, or the tumour as such; consumption of platelets may be increased (eg, due to disseminated intravascular coagulation); they may be destroyed by immune reactions, and production may be reduced because of bone marrow involvement (Helfand 1988). Some cats suffering from lymphoma or leukaemia tested PBA negative while others tested positive. Thrombocytopenic dogs suffering from neoplastic diseases, such as lymphoma or tumours of the liver or spleen had positive PBA test results. Thus, there are indications for an immune-mediated destruction of platelets in both dogs and cats with neoplastic diseases (Kohn et al 2000b).",

In this study, seven out of 42 cats displayed spontaneous bleeding. In a study by Jordan et al (1993), nine out of 41 cats showed spontaneous haemorrhage. Bleeding was related to platelet values below 30 \u00d7 109/l, and occurred in cats suffering from neoplasia (n\n = 5), infections with FeLV (2), pITP (n\n = 1), or associated to an Eisenmenger's syndrome (n\n = 1). In our study, 10 of 13 cats with platelet counts <30 \u00d7 109/l displayed no clinical signs of haemorrhage. Whether bleeding occurs or not is not only dependent on the number of platelets but also on their age and functionality and on the vascular integrity. According to Jordan et al (1993) cats seem to be able to tolerate very low platelet counts without showing spontaneous bleeding. This could be explained by thrombocytes of cats being activated more easily than those of dogs. Feline platelets are stimulated more readily by aggregation inductors, such as collagen or thrombin, than those of dogs (Hart and Nolte 1991). Activation of thrombocytes results in the release of serotonin. Meyers et al (1982) showed that dense-granules of cats contain 3 or 1.5 times the amount of serotonin compared to dense-granules of humans or dogs, respectively. Serotonin is a potent vasoconstrictor and induces primary aggregation of platelets. In addition, serotonin will potentiate the aggregation effect of other agonists (Meyers et al 1982).",

Colman et al (1983) showed that PBA may alter the shape, volume, and morphology of human thrombocytes, which may interfere with their function. The effect of anti-platelet antibodies on in vitro platelet function was investigated in 15 dogs with ITP. In 13 of these dogs, maximal platelet aggregation was significantly inhibited in response to adenosine diphosphate, thrombin, or collagen/epinephrine suggesting platelet dysfunction (Kristensen et al 1994b). Similar studies in cats have not been performed.",
