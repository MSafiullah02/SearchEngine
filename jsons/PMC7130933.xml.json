This attempted partitioning of cognate regulatable technologies as distinct from \u2018tissues and cells\u2019, and tissue-engineered products can be illustrated in a wide variety of discursive settings such as multi-stakeholder forums and European policy debates. A key aspect of the emergence of new regulation around TE products is debate about the scope of new regulations. This has taken the form of attention focused on what might be included or excluded in new legislative instruments. Commissioner Byrne, commenting in the European Parliament on the debate on the TCD made the following statement:\u2018\u2026 it is not appropriate to include organs in the scope of this directive.\u2026 their transplantation requires a different policy approach due to their specific nature\u2026 Following the example of the blood directive\u2026 we would like to get the science right first, before tabling a legal instrument in this sensitive area..\u2019 (EC (European Commission), 2003).

Increasingly stringent regulation will seek to extend technical standards within the hospital sector as well as industry. The extension of industry-endorsed standards to tissue users in national healthcare systems is intended to strengthen the overall purity of tissue practices, including in its ambit the increasing application of \u2018engineering\u2019 manipulations to human materials in public sector services.

Thus there was conflict not only over the public representation of TE science, but also over the agenda-shaping activity of participating stakeholders.

A major impetus behind the regulatory movements has been the formal opinion produced by the EC's specialist advisory group, the European Group on Ethics (EGE) in science and new technology, who stated in 1998 that there was an \u2018urgent need to regulate the conditions under which human tissues circulate within the European Market\u2019 (EGE, 1998). EGE principles are enunciated in some detail in the TCD, which quotes the four guiding principles: the ethical imperative to protect human health; the integrity of the human body; the free consent of donors; and the protection of identity. It also emphasises EGE's backing donation as \u2018a voluntary act of solidarity\u2019. The preface to the directive notes that a survey of Member States revealed that \u2018considerable discrepancies\u2019 exist in national rules covering safety, quality and use of human tissues and that rules for authorisation and inspection of tissue procurement and banking activities were lacking in the majority. Thus regulatory measures to increase the purification of such activities were to be expected and have emerged in the subsequent directive. We see increased rigour in matters of donor consent and traceability of the source of donated tissues\u2014autologous (donor and recipient same individual) technologies are construed as ethically cleaner than allogeneic (donor(s) and recipient(s) different) technologies; a trend that links the ethics of medical therapy with an ethic of clean evidence; an ethic that portrays (especially embryonic) stem cells as a socially \u2018dirty\u2019 area in comparison to tissue-engineered technology.

Indeed it is at the boundaries where different arenas of discourse and value meet, that some of the most acute tensions are to be seen. This paper furnishes a number of examples of this. Evidentiality and governance are becoming more closely linked in contemporary health-related social processes. Information and its social use as \u2018evidence\u2019 have a regulatory function that is emphasised in forms of governance that can be characterised as the \u2018regulatory state\u2019. Strathern (1999) and Majone (1997), from the different perspectives of social anthropology and public policy studies, have pointed to the regulatory role of information. And in analysis of medical technology innovation, the regulatory role of the new healthcare sciences has been shown (Faulkner & Kent, 2001; Lehoux & Blume, 2000; May, Mort, Mair, & Williams, 2001). Key tensions were also apparent in the EC/EU debate on the TCD in which discourses of commerce and ethics came into conflict. This is seen for example in the issue of not-for-profit donation. In a further example, the social management of the tension between evidentiality and ethics can be seen in the strategic containment of unproven technologies within the boundaries of clinical trials.",

Standards and their surveillance are reaching further into the technology and the healthcare system. Europe as a trade area is partly constituted by regulatory and standard-setting activity, as we have seen in the partitioning processes observed above. In the case of sourcing of human tissue technology, regulatory standardisation takes the form of a framework that allows national variation on some important dimensions, such as ethical standpoints vis-\u00e0-vis certain types of animal or human tissue. Transnational technical standards appear to be promoted to a greater extent than do ethical standards. This is likely to support the development of technological markets and the circulation of technical knowledge and expertise within them. As Barry suggests: \u2018In general, those objects and practices that are considered scientific or technical are precisely those which\u2026escape territorial constraints\u2019 and.. \u2018making a technical practice more \u201csocial\u201d or \u201ccultural\u201d\u2026.may serve to restrict its movement\u2019 (Barry, 2003, pp. 38\u20139).\n",

We are witnessing a trend toward the \u2018purification\u2019 of therapeutic technology and its sources, associated with the increased use of human tissues and cells and the development of engineering of tissues and cells. Alongside the increasingly stringent response to pollutions, we have also shown the sometimes contested partitioning processes in the classificatory ordering of a TE zone. Pollution practices and classificatory partitioning work can be seen in the material innovation of TE technology, in the social and organisational processes of regulation itself, in the discourses of evidentiality and commercialisation, and in debate about social values. The four arenas of discourse considered here can be seen as constitutive of the societal ordering and valuing of tissue-engineered technologies under conditions of increasing human, animal and material malleability, complexity and risk. Whether the trends toward increasing delineation and regulatory purity will engender public confidence in TE remains an open question.",

If these partitioning processes and pollution ideas express a \u2018general view of the social order\u2019, \u00e0 la Douglas, it is perhaps to support the sense of a highly differentiated but highly interlinked nexus of shifting relations of society, technology and nature. In this nexus socio-material boundaries are dynamic and contested, and it is at the boundaries that concepts of pollution and partitioning are most salient. The permeability of boundaries can be observed in an old depiction of a \u2018primitive world view\u2019 consisting of \u2018Physical forces\u2026interwoven with the lives of persons. Things\u2026not completely distinguished from persons, and persons\u2026 not completely distinguished from their external environment\u2019 (Douglas, 1966, p. 107), which has certain parallels with contemporary theorisation of a complex, risky, interconnected form of life in hybrid notions such as socio-technology, social ecology, citizen science, risk society, and biosociality.",
