Objectives: To investigate pharmacists and pharmacy students' awareness and source of their information regard the management of the coronavirus pandemic, and their perspective of their role during this emergent situation. Methods: This descriptive cross-sectional online survey study was conducted in Jordan during the COVID-19 outbreak (from 15 to 30 March 2020). A validated online questionnaire addressing participants' current awareness about epidemics/pandemics and COVID-19, source of information and their perspectives of their role. Data were analyzed using statistical package for social science (SPSS). Results: Participants (n = 726) had a mean age of 26.9 (8.0) years with 71.9% females. Pharmacy students made 35.3% of the sample while the rest were pharmacists. Only 54.3% of participants believed that they got enough education about epidemics/pandemics, and 94.6% of them follow on the latest coronavirus updates on treatments, and that is mainly from the media (59.5%) followed by the World Health Organization reports (58.7%) and then the published researches (57%). Awareness score (out of 20) of pharmacists (n = 470) was significantly higher (p < 0.001) than that of students (n = 256). Better Awareness scores were also associated with higher age of participants, graduating from a public versus a private university, and attending more educational workshops. Conclusion: The majority of pharmacists and pharmacy students reported that they have a major role in the management of epidemics/pandemics through the community pharmacies but the majority follow on the latest coronavirus updates from the media. This fact rings bills considering the numerous conflicting messages publicized during the pandemic through the media.",

            "text": "According to the Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC, USA), epidemic refers to a rapid increase in cases of a disease over what is the normally expected occurrence in a particular community or geographic area, with significant population proportions affected in that area. 1 Epidemic escalate to a pandemic, when the disease spreads over wider geographical zones, across countries and continents and affects a higher number of people all over the world. 1 In recent months, the World Health Organization (WHO) and CDC declared the coronavirus infectious disease (coronavirus disease 2019, termed COVID-19) 2,3 as a pandemic caused by a newly discovered coronavirus strain named 'severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2' or SARS CoV-2, colloquially referred to as COVID-19. 2, 3 Coronavirus (COVID- 19) belong to a family of RNA-viruses which take humans and mammals as formal hosts to live and replicate. 4 COVID-19 has been reported as an extraordinarily contagious virus. 5 People who get infected with this virus experience mild to moderate https://doi.org/10.1016/j.sapharm.2020.04.020 Received 19 April 2020; Accepted 20 April 2020 respiratory distress including fever, dry cough, and shortness of breath. 2, 6, 7 According to a recent study by Huang et al., manifests as clusters of severe respiratory symptoms similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreaks caused by coronaviruses viruses reported within the last two decades. 6 These viruses were termed severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV); both have resulted in more than 10,000 cumulative cases, with high fatality rates in both cases. 6 At the end of 2019, the novel COVID-19 has disseminated rapidly, starting with China then spreading to many countries around the world in a short space of time, with no clear treatment or vaccine in sight as yet. 6, 8, 9 As of April 1, 2020, it is reported by the WHO that COVID-19 outbreak has resulted in 823,626 confirmed cases in the world, 40,598 cases of confirmed deaths, and 206 countries have the disease. 2 Pharmacists are a part of the health care system, and their role is critical in completing the management cycle of coronavirus outbreak. 10 On the March 19, 2020, the International Pharmaceutical Federation (FIP) released a guideline to clarify the required coronavirus information for pharmacists and the pharmacy workforce, 11 in addition this guideline stipulated the responsibility/role of both community and hospital pharmacists in the control of this outbreak. 11 Pharmacists need to be engaged in the coordinated efforts during pandemics, and be readily adaptive to changes required in pharmacy practice. As FIP advocated, \"community pharmacies in outbreak-affected and unaffected countries are often the first point of contact with the health system for those with health-related concerns or simply in need of information and reliable advice\". 11 Hence, it is important to explore how pharmacists around the world are managing their customary and newly emerging roles during the COVID-19 outbreak. From Macau, China, home of the outbreak, it was documented, from the perspective of the authors, that pharmacists had roles in ensuring the stable supply of key medicines, providing information about the coronavirus infection, performing early detection of cases and appropriate referral, and implementing government arrangement such as the Guaranteed Mask Supply Scheme. 10 Another study from China acknowledged that community pharmacy management teams shall support different services by providing adequate supply of COVID-19 related medications and preventative products, in addition to providing sufficient staff trainings. 12 From Colombia, community pharmacists were proposed to contribute to the early detection and appropriate referral of possible cases of the virus, then to be reported through designated telephone lines in addition to providing patient education. 13 From the United Arab Emirates (UAE), it was stated that pharmacists can also play a role in promoting an empathy culture to help in preventing the stigmatization of infected individuals based on ethnicity, population or nationality, and by broadcasting facts in their communities via various media. 14 It is expected that pharmacists around the world are finding their ways to contribute to the collaborative forces in combating the spread of the virus. But for pharmacists to assume a role in humanitarian and health emergency settings, the application of real-world data, 10 in addition to the provision of tailored training programs, taking into consideration all aspects, including the psychological impact of such roles, are vital. 15, 16 Published research so far provide reference for pharmacists on providing patient care services to improve patient's outcomes and make a contribution to the control of the pandemic. No previous study has looked into pharmacists' own perspective of their role in the management of the coronavirus pandemic, their awareness of important facts needed to be able to deliver their roles successfully, and the source of such facts.",

The first section included items to collect demographics data. The second section included items aimed at assessing potential participants' current epidemics/pandemics and COVID-19 awareness; here potential participating pharmacists were asked about how much they know about the coronavirus, including a) symptoms, b) modes of transmission, c) how to prevent the transmission and the spread of the virus, and d) awareness about where to access the latest coronavirus updates regarding treatment. For each of these sections, there were several detailed items, e.g. participants when asked, for example, were probed about the modes of coronavirus transmission, such as if the virus can be transmitted from the respiratory droplets from person to person among close contacts and after touching surfaces that were contaminated by the virus. 19 Other questions investigated participants' awareness regarding the highest risk patients in addition to the symptoms that are associated with coronavirus such as fever, dry cough, shortness of breath, muscle aches and gastrointestinal symptoms. 19 The latest coronavirus updates on treatment were questioned, for example, if hydroxychloroquine alone or in combination with azithromycin have been used as a preventive therapy against coronavirus infection, or if oseltamivir is being used in the management of the coronavirus infection. [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] Another question assessed the awareness concerning the use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen when there is an infection. 24, 25 Other questions in the treatment section were about whether the use of some drugs (glucocorticoids and autoimmune disease medications) increase the susceptibility to contract coronavirus infection. 26, 27 Participants' awareness of how to prevent the transmission and the spread of the virus was assessed in depth as well, such as if washing hands with soap and water for 20 s would be enough to clean the hands, also the least distance that should be kept while counseling patients (2 m/6 feet). 19, 28, 29 Two questions were about exercise, the first one asked if exercise causes antibodies and white blood cells to circulate more rapidly in the body, therefore detecting and combating infections at an early stage, and the second question asked if the brief rise in body temperature during and after exercise prevents bacterial growth, thus increases the body's ability to fight the infection. 17, 30 The rest of the questions were about the immune system and ways to boost it, to combat the viral infection. 17, 19, 31, 32 For example, participants were asked if protein-calorie malnutrition increases the opportunistic infection 33, 34 ; and the role of garlic, mushrooms, vitamin C and D was also questioned. Not smoking and the importance of decreasing stress to boost immunity was also questioned. [35] [36] [37] And finally, the effect of sunlight in activating the T-helper cells in order to boost the immunity was questioned. 38 Participants were asked to provide their email to receive the answers for the awareness questions once the study was completed if they wished to receive this information. Potential participants were also given the choice to view the correct answers via a Facebook page designed for this study. All items in this section required a True/False/Not sure response.",

            "text": "The majority of participants indicated that they will be able to act if they suspected that a patient has COVID-19. One of the important aspects of pharmacy practice in the context of pharmaceutical care is being able to triage patients to appropriate health care. 44 Furthermore, the majority of participants were willing to deliver medicines to patients' homes. This is not required by the Jordanian Drug and Pharmacy laws and in fact pharmacists are not allowed to adopt a courier home delivery service. 45 Hence, during the COVID-19 pandemic only registered pharmacists were allowed to deliver medications. This would be an effective service especially for elderly patients were the risk of infection and its complication are increased, although of course the delivery personnel should probably be pharmacy staff/trainee pharmacists to 'free-up' pharmacy capacity in a pandemic situation. 19 Some participants indicated that they were willing to dispense hydroxychloroquine directly to patients. This is quite surprising as hydroxychloroquine has been regulated by the Jordan Food and Drug Administration and is not allowed to be sold in the community pharmacy without a valid prescription. Furthermore, the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine has not been thoroughly established for COVID-19 # using simple linear regression, $ using multiple linear regression, * significant at 0.05 significance level. and the medication has a risk: benefit profile that requires clinical supervision when used. Participants' willingness to dispense without prescription may be influenced by the media which has been proposing hydroxychloroquine as the treatment of COVID-19. About 95% of participants in this study reported that they currently follow the latest coronavirus updates on treatments obtaining their information mostly (60% of them) from the media. Highlighting more reliable sources such as the FIP released guideline in March of this year could benefit in providing accurate information to pharmacists globally, by clarifying required coronavirus information for pharmacists and the pharmacy workforce, and presenting evidence-based information. 11 Many pharmacists were not sure about the role of hydroxychloroquine (12%) and 29% of them thought it has been used as a preventative therapy against the coronavirus infection. It may be posed that Jordanian pharmacists need to be made aware about current preliminary recommendations for the symptomatic management of mild COVID-19 cases, i.e.fluids, antipyretics and rest. Specialist hospital unit physicians of course have trialed and may be using treatments such as chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine, as well as of course ventilatory support for patients with severe respiratory distress symptoms. 46 Most participants (72%) knew that azithromycin has been trialed along with hydroxychloroquine in the treatment of the coronavirus infection, while only 28% knew that antivirals, such as oseltamivir, have been used in the management in critical cases of the infection and 46% were not sure. 46 Ibuprofen the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicine, or NSAID, is sold under a number of brand names, including Advil\u00ae and Nurofen\u00ae. In addition to treating pain, it's often used to manage fever associated with various viral or bacterial infections. At the time of designing this study, it was said that NSAIDs such as ibuprofen can increase the risk of complications when used during viral infections (including the coronavirus infection). However, the WHO declared on March 18, 2020 under a post titled 'Anti-inflammatory drug has been subject of conflicting reports' that 'there's no evidence to suggest that using ibuprofen to manage symptoms of COVID-19 will worsen the condition'. Earlier reports said a spokesperson had cautioned against using ibuprofen to manage symptoms of the illness caused by the coronavirus until WHO experts could investigate'. This case provides a good example on the confusing information provided to healthcare professionals, including pharmacists, via the media regarding COVID-19 pandemic. 47 The use of corticosteroids by COVID-19 patients has also been a confusing issue to many pharmacists. Corticosteroids were widely used during previous outbreaks of similar types of infection such as the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)-CoV. 48 However, although there appeared to be some evidence that corticosteroids may be beneficial if used in the early acute phase of infections, conflicting evidence from the WHO surrounding corticosteroid use in certain viral infections means this evidence is not conclusive. 49 Current reports indicate no unique reason exists to expect that patients with COVID-19 infection will benefit from corticosteroids, and they might be more likely to be harmed with such treatment. 50 Hence, considering the current availability of literature, caution should be exercised until further evidence emerges surrounding the use of corticosteroids in COVID-19 patients. 51 Pharmacists and pharmacy students showed acceptable awareness about the COVID-19 pandemic as more than half of them knew the correct answers to the awareness related items except for the items probing the appropriate distance they need to maintain between them and the patients; the majority (67%) believed that at least 3 m (10 feet) were the needed distance when counseling patients during a pandemic while the appropriate answer as per Jordanian guidelines is 2 m (6 feet) and 7% were not sure. It was important to raise awareness about this fact (as participants received the correct answers upon completion of the study), because anecdotal comments from pharmacists indicated that some did not allow customers to come anywhere near them which negatively affected the counseling process. The majority (76%) of them were not aware of the highest risk population group in terms of contracting the coronavirus infection and they believed that children under the age of 9 were at highest risk along with and to the same extent as the elderly (>65) and immune-compromised patients, while 5% were not sure. It was interesting to note that generally significantly more pharmacists answered the awareness items on the survey correctly than pharmacy student. This may indicate the experience boosts clinical awareness and reasoning skills of pharmacists. Study results indicated that not only being a practicing pharmacist versus a pharmacy student was associated with better awareness, but that older age, being a public university alumnus versus a private university alumnus, attending more educational workshops on a yearly basis were also significantly associated with a better level of awareness. None of these are of course surprising except of course the difference in graduating from a different type of educational institution (public vs. private). It is noteworthy to recognize that this finding could be due to the fact that about half of the graduates from the private educational institutions in Jordan are international students, who travel back to their countries once they graduate; international students who remain in Jordan are not able to practice as pharmacists.",

Although benefits may be found in this approach of dispensing in the COVID-19 era, suboptimal counseling raises a concern. This discussion falls unto policymakers to make a clear announcement about whether to allow, encourage, or prohibit pharmacists from dispensing coronavirus patients' medications via the drivethrough service. In public health emergencies, clinical pharmacists enact their professional expertise by analyzing the current situation rationally and working in a professionally cohesive and efficient manner to provide innovative pharmacy services around medication safety and rational use of medicines. 43 We acknowledge that the scope of community pharmacy practice varies considerably across countries, hence, it is important to examine ways in which the profession can assist with the public health response to COVID-19. This can be donenot only by maintaining the continuity of healthcare services but by achieving optimal use of possible services. 54 A limitation of this study is that it was conducted via an online questionnaire, but due to the pandemic that the world is going through, and the public quarantine currently imposed in Jordan, other research methods were possible. There are of course, issues of representativeness in the profile about participants. A majority of the participants were from Amman, the capital, where the availability of CPD workshops can be higher than in other areas of the country. We did not ask the pharmacy students about their study year, which could have played a role in the results obtained; fourth and fifth year students for example are expected to have a wider awareness in the clinical field as compared to students in the earlier years of their study. The survey itself, is also of course not validated, although, items were put together in real-time, based on the literature and reviewed by a team of clinical pharmacy experts.",

The majority believed they have a major role in the management of epidemics/ pandemics through their pharmacies. Certain gaps in the awareness about COVID-19 were identified highlighting areas of improvement, and generally, pharmacists showed significantly higher awareness score than students, which is, in a way, a satisfactory and expected finding. Higher age of participants, graduating from a public university versus a private university, and attending educational workshops on a yearly basis also significantly affected the awareness level.",
