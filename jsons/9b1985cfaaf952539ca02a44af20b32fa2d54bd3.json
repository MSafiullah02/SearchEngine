In industrialized countries, acute respiratory infections cause enormous direct and indirect healthcare costs, in addition to being a major cause of morbidity. They can also be an important cause of mortality among children, the elderly, and immunocompromised patients [Glezen et al., 2000; Barsaoui et al., 2001; Bianco et al., 2002] . The causative agents of acute respiratory infections encompass a wide variety of microorganisms. Viral causes may be responsible for more than 35% of lower respiratory tract infections [Barsaoui et al., 2001; Siritantikorn et al., 2002] . Respiratory syncytial virus, followed by parainfluenza, and influenza viruses are the most common viruses to cause lower respiratory tract infections [Shann, 1986; Puthavathana et al., 1990; Siritantikorn et al., 2002] . Indeed, respiratory syncytial virus may be responsible for more than 78% of lower respiratory tract infections among children [Barsaoui et al., 2001; Carballal et al., 2001; Hall et al., 2001; Zambon et al., 2001; Siritantikorn et al., 2002] .",

Influenza viruses may also be an important cause of lower respiratory tract infections in both children and the elderly, but with a shorter duration of illness [Zambon et al., 2001] . Adenoviruses, generally, are quite notorious in causing outbreaks among military recruits [Sanchez et al., 2001] but have also been reported in children <5 years of age [Larranaga et al., 2000] . Although human rhinoviruses are the most common upper respiratory pathogens, inducing the majority of common colds worldwide, recent evidence has suggested an association between human rhinoviruses with asthma exacerbations, including severe episodes requiring hospitalization. This indicates that human rhinovirus infections can result in serious disease [Miller et al., 2007; Louie et al., 2009] . Current evidence supports the notion that human rhinoviruses infect the lower airways, inducing a local inflammatory response [Papadopoulos et al., 2000] . Such evidence suggests that the role of human rhinoviruses in other lower respiratory diseases, such as pneumonia, bronchitis, bronchiolitis, and cystic fibrosis, should be re-examined with more sensitive molecular techniques.",

Patients were admitted to Mubarak Al-Kabir Hospital, Kuwait. The specimens included nasopharyngeal aspirate, nasopharyngeal swabs, bronchoalveolar lavage, and tracheal aspirate. They were collected in the hospital and processed at the Virology Unit, Faculty of Medicine, Kuwait University for the presence of viral nucleic acid using PCR techniques. The study population included 542 male and 472 female patients. Of the 1,014 patients with lower respiratory tract infections, 155 (53.8%) presented with bronchiolitis, 100 (34.7%) with pneumonia, and 33 (11.5%) with croup. The age of the patients ranged between 3 days and 76 years. The majority of samples were collected during autumn and winter.

            "text": "In this study, 74.6% of the patients were under the age of 5 years, 58.3% were less than 1 year of age. This age distribution is similar to that reported by other studies from elsewhere [Denny and Clyde, 1983; Al-Hajjar et al., 1998; Farshad et al., 2008] . Male patients under the age of 5 years in this study tended to have a slightly higher incidence of lower respiratory tract infections when compared to female patients but over the age of 6 years the male-to-female sex ratio was almost similar. This is in general agreement with findings by other studies [Glezen and Denny, 1973] . Bronchiolitis and pneumonia were the most frequent clinical features found to be associated with lower respiratory tract viral infections among patients in this study. This is similar to that reported from other parts of the world [Hijazi et al., 1996; Al-Hajjar et al., 1998; Barsaoui et al., 2001] . Respiratory syncytial virus was detected in 36.8% of the patients. Of these 84% were aged <1 year, and thus, respiratory syncytial virus was by far the most common virus detected in infants with lower respiratory tract infections in Kuwait. Significantly, perhaps, 69.7% of those in whom respiratory syncytial virus was detected, had croup and 30.3% had bronchiolitis. This is also in agreement with a number of published studies from the Gulf region and elsewhere [Al-Hajjar et al., 1998; Wahab et al., 2001; Al-Toum et al., 2006; Farshad et al., 2008; Kaplan et al., 2008] . It was important to find in this study that human rhinoviruses were the second viruses detected most commonly in samples from patients with lower respiratory tract infections, since 34.4% of patients appear to have been infected with this virus. Also very importantly that 50.5% who had rhinoviruses were infants aged <1 year. Significantly, 42% of the patients infected with rhinoviruses had pneumonia and 36.8% had bronchiolitis. Others have also reported human rhinoviruses in children admitted to hospital with lower respiratory tract infections [Calvo et al., 2007; Chung et al., 2007; Peltola et al., 2008] . In contrast, adenoviruses were detected in only 15.2% of the patients, 38.6% of whom were infants aged <1 year. Nearly 23% of adenovirus infections were associated with bronchiolitis and 12% with pneumonia. In a number of recent reports, adenoviruses were detected in infants suffering from lower respiratory tract infections [Hong et al., 2001; Al-Toum et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2007; Kaplan et al., 2008] . In Turkey, both respiratory syncytial virus and adenoviruses were detected with a frequency of 31.5%, and these were the most common agents causing disease in infants [Y\u00fc ksel et al., 2008] .",

In this study, virus was most frequently (42%) detected in nasopharyngeal aspirates than in nasopharyngeal swabs (29.2%), bronchoalveolar lavage (23.6%), or in tracheal aspirate (5.2%). Indeed, in adult and mixed adult-pediatric populations, nasopharyngeal aspirates were shown to have advantages over nasopharyngeal swabs for the identification of influenza viruses [Covalciuc et al., 1999; Lieberman et al., 2009] .
