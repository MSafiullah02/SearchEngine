The high fatality rate is likely to decline as milder clinical cases emerge. Similar to SARS, common symptoms in patients with MERS-CoV include fever, cough, shortness of breath, and gastrointestinal symptoms. Most patients have had pneumonia and the majority was reported to have multiple co-morbid conditions.3, 4\n",

The use of the discussed agents would require monitoring hematological and biochemical parameters during treatment to detect and prevent adverse effects associated with therapy. Possible dosages of discussed agents especially with unavailability of intravenous ribavarin are listed in Table 5\n. The table also includes the possible dosage of pegelated interferon-\u03b1 (PegIFN\u2014\u03b1) that is commonly used in the treatment of hepatitis C virus infection. PegIFN-\u03b1 was 50-100 times more effective in vitro for MERS-CoV than SARS-CoV.25 The long half-life of PegIFN-\u03b1 and the associated adverse effects calls for extra attention for the use of shorter-acting interferon.25 The use of interferon therapy with ribavirin is not recommended in patients with hepatitis C virus infection and renal dysfunction (Clcr <50 mL/minute).",
