After treatment, the inoculated sections were cut out and processed to quantify viable organisms.3, 4 All tests were performed in triplicate.

Twenty cycles of steam treatment did not adversely affect fit testing performance, consistent with previous reports that short cycles of steam treatment may have minimal effect on N95 filtration and fit performance.1\n,\n4 Further work is needed to assess the impact of short cycles of steam treatment on filtration efficiency and to develop technologies that could provide steam treatments for respirators and face masks in healthcare settings.",
