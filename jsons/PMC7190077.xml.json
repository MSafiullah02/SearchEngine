Firstly, this study is a single centre cohort study, and the sample size was insufficient to compare treatment effects in different subgroups, which could lead to an unbalanced distribution of confounders when evaluating viral shedding and viral load. Secondly, viral load is influenced by many factors. The quality of collected samples directly affects the viral load, so the study of viral load only partly reflects the amount of virus in the body. Thirdly, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) cannot distinguish between viable and non-viable virus and does not reflect the replication level of the virus in different tissue. However, PCR has higher sensitivity, is easy to perform, and is widely used in the detection of viral load.35 In addition, only collecting samples from patients who remain in hospital could overinflate estimates of viral load and duration at a later time point. Finally, since accurate diagnosis was not available during the early stages of the epidemic, stool and urine samples of the earliest infected patients were not collected until early February, hence we recruited patients with positive respiratory samples and could not evaluate patients with negative respiratory samples against other sample types.",
