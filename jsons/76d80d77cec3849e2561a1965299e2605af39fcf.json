            "text": "Tight junctions are intercellular junctions adjacent to the apical ends of paracellular spaces. They have two classical functions, the barrier function and the fence function. The former regulates the passage of ions, water and various molecules through paracellular spaces, and is thus related to edema, jaundice, diarrhea and blood-borne metastasis. The latter function maintains cell polarity by forming a fence to prevent intermixing of molecules in the apical membrane with those in the lateral membrane. This function is deeply involved in cancer cell properties in terms of loss of cell polarity. Recently, two novel aspects of tight junctions have been reported. One is their involvement in signal transduction. The other is that fact that tight junctions are considered to be a crucial component of innate immunity. In addition, since some proteins comprising tight junctions work as receptors for viruses and extracellular stimuli, pathogenic bacteria and viruses target and affect the tight junction functions, leading to diseases. In this review, the relationship between tight junctions and human diseases will be described.",

For this purpose, all of their surfaces, the skin, gastrointestinal tract, respiratory tract, etc., are covered by various kinds of epithelia. In particular, for epithelial and endothelial sheets to work efficiently as a barrier, 1-5 paracellular spaces must be strictly sealed by tight junctions, which are characterized as a set of continuous and anastomosing strands at the apicalmost regions of the lateral cell membranes (Fig. 1) .",

When tight junctions of epithelial cells that cover the biliary tree and gastrointestinal tract become disordered, jaundice and diarrhea occur, respectively. Although vascular permeability depends on both the paracellular pathway and transcellular pathway of endothelial sheets, edema develops mainly as a result of the dysfunction of tight junctions between cells. Thus, dysfunction of tight junctions is considered to be intimately related to various pathological conditions. 6 Epithelial cells have two distinct domains of the cell surface; the apical and basolateral cell membranes. Since the two domains play different roles, the compositions of proteins and lipids in the respective membrane domains are different. To prevent intermixing of molecules in the apical membrane with those in the lateral membrane, tight junctions continuously surrounding the apical pole work as a fence. This function of the tight junction is referred as the fence function. When the function is impaired, cells fail to perform their vectorial work, in terms of loss of cell polarity, and this is presumably deeply involved in cancer cell biology.",

            "text": "Of the proteins comprising tight junctions, the integral membrane proteins are the claudin family, 2,3,7 tight junctionassociated MARVEL proteins (TAMPs) 5, 8 composed of occludin, tricellulin 9 and MARVELD3, the immunoglobulin superfamily composed of the JAM family, CAR, and ESAM, Bves 10 and LSR (lypolysis-stimulated lipoprotein receptor). 11 The claudin family, comprised of 27 members, is exclusively responsible for the formation of tight junction strands. Claudins are necessary and sufficient for the formation of tight junctions by homophilic and heterophilic binding to adjacent cells. 12, 13 Regarding hereditary diseases, mutations of the claudin-1 gene cause neonatal sclerosing cholangitis with ichthyosis. 14 Those of claudin-14 cause deafness. 15 Some claudins are expected to form extracellular aqueous pores in paracellular spaces. 16, 17 Distinct examples are claudin-16/ paracellin-1 18 and claudin-19, 19 which are responsible for hereditary hypomagnesemia. Similarly, claudins are considered to form selective channels in tight junctions because of the existence of charged amino acids on the first extracellular loop. 17 Several claudins are expressed in one cell. 1,2 Their regulation is very complicated, as it is both claudin-specific and cell-specific. Claudin-1, -6 and -9 are reported to be required for the entry of hepatitis C virus (HCV) into hepatocytes after binding of HCV to CD81. 20 Claudins have been reported to recruit and promote the activation of pro-MMP-2. 21, 22 Claudin-7, however, is reported to suppress expression of MMP-3. 23 In addition, claudin-7 interacts with Ep-CAM 24 and, in claudin-7-deficient mice, expression of integrin a2 is reduced and its localization altered in the intestinal epithelia. 23 These findings show that some claudins play as yet unknown roles in cellular processes other than tight junction functions.",

To establish the cell polarity of epithelial cells, in terms of development of the junctional complexes, E-cadherin and/or nectin first bind to the respective molecules on the surfaces of adjacent cells in a homophilic manner. Immediately thereafter, ZO-1 and JAM-A are recruited at spot-like primordial adherens junctions, and then Par3, Par6 and aPKC are recruited to JAM-A, and occludin and claudin are also recruited to ZO-1 complexes. Lastly, by unknown mechanisms probably involving an aPKC/Par complex and delivery of the integral membrane proteins, tight junctions are segregated from adherens junctions. Consistently, during polarization of mouse teratoma cell line F9, HNF-4a plays crucial roles in the formation of tight junctions 43 as well as adherens junctions. 44 Furthermore HNF-4a induces formation of microvilli on the apical surface. 45 These findings show that formation of tight junctions is very closely related to the establishment of cell polarity.",

The fence function segregates growth factors that exist in the apical surface from their receptors on the basolateral cell surface, establishing cell polarity. 51 On the other hand, the barrier function prevents growth factors localized on the apical side from diffusing into paracellular spaces. Upon dysfunction of tight junctions, growth factors bind to their receptors on basolateral membranes though permeable tight junctions, resulting in quick responses to stimuli. This ligand-receptor segregation by tight junctions may be critical to maintain the physiological condition. 51 The fence and the barrier functions of tight junctions are well recognized. Recently, two other roles of tight junctions have become clear. One is regulation of signal transduction. 52 Actually, occludin is capable of binding to many signal transduction-related molecules such as TGF-b, 53 and participates in apoptosis. 30 It has become clear that tight junctions tether some of the important molecules of the Hippo pathway, which is a growth suppressive pathway activated by unknown factors. In addition, Merlin (neurofibromatosis type II gene) is a tumor suppressor gene that shuttles between the nucleus and tight junctions. 54 Since the Hippo pathway is considered to be deeply related to contact inhibition, the question of how tight junctions are involved needs to be clarified, as do the stimulants of the pathway.",

In this context, dendritic cells residing between epithelial cells express occludin, claudin-1 and ZO-1, sending their dendrites outside through paracellular spaces in the colonic epithelium, probably to sample antigens in the intestine. 55 A similar relationship between dendritic cells and epithelial cells has been observed in the nasal mucosa, 56 and the epidermis. 57 These findings imply that dendritic cells may pass through intercellular spaces by using tight junction molecules to sense extrinsic noxious molecules.",

The second mechanism is a change in actin organization. This organization takes place in a wide variety of cellular conditions, including regulation of tight junctions. In particular, some kinds of bacteria directly affect Rho and myosin light chain kinase activities in tight junction functions. 6 Toxins from Clostridium diphtheriae, Clostridium difficile and enteropathogenic Escherichia coli change Rho activity by modification of amino acids to cause severe colitis, the former two causing psuedomembranous colitis. Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli also induces myosin light chain phosphorylation, resulting in diarrhea. ZOT of V. cholerae activates PKC, resulting in loss of tight junctions.",

Recent studies have disclosed that claudins are the major determinant of the barrier function of tight junctions. Importantly, the first extracellular loop, in which there is a wide variation in the position and number of charged amino acids depending on each claudin, is known to create paracellular pores (channels) for cations or anions between neighboring cells. 13 The expression of putative cation-permissive claudin-2, -7, -12 and -15 in the intestine of vitamin D receptor-deficient mice was compared to that of wild mice, 77 clearly showing a decrease of claudin-2 and -12. This was confirmed by approaches using RNAi and overexpression in the vitamin D-responsive intestinal cell line Caco-2. 78 These two claudins are essential for Ca 2+ absorption between intestinal epithelial cells, providing a novel mechanism underlying vitamin D-dependent intestinal Ca 2+ transport. Thus, vitamin D deficiency rickets affects Ca 2+ absorption in the intestine via the paracellular pathway as well as the transcellular pathway. ",

In the early stage of diabetic retinopathy, VEGF makes the BRB highly permeable. RAR-a reduces VEGF expression in astrocytes, resulting in a marked decrease in the leakage of dye from the BRB. 87 It is very clear that dysfunction of tight junctions of the BRB initially causes diabetic retinopathy. However, these results suggest that it is possible to indirectly treat diabetic retinopathy using a paracrine mechanism. In this case, astrocytes may be the most suitable target for treatment in the early phase of diabetic retinopathy in terms of maintaining the impermeability of the BRB.",

Regarding cancer cells, however, EMT is deeply associated with the malignant properties of invasion and metastasis. In the process of invasion and metastasis, cancer cells detach from cell nests and change from epithelial to mesenchymal shape. Epithelial-mesenchymal transition is accompanied by loss of occludin and claudins as well as E-cadherin. The genes of these proteins contain an E-box in their promoter. 101 The loss of tight junctions is visualized by the fence function. As shown in Fig. 7, 102 well-differentiated adenocarcoma cells of the pancreas still possessing the fence function phenotypically change into poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma and lose the function with EMT-inducing treatments such as TGF-b-treatment and hypoxia. Both treatments significantly induce Slug, SIP1 and Snail in the well-differentiated adenocarcoma cells, 102 These transcriptional factors bind to E-box in the promoter of E-cadherin and tight junction protein genes, probably resulting in undergoing EMT. This change is reversible, indicating that cancer cells undergo EMT and MET, presumably induced by cytokines such as TGF-b, not genetic or epigenetic changes.",

As a result, cell proliferation occurs in an autocrine manner. 51 The other feasible mechanism is related to signal transduction. Tight junctions work as docks of cell cycle-regulating molecules 52 and as a possible target of the Hippo pathway suppressive of cell proliferation and crucial for organ size regulation. 40 Tight junctions tether Hippo signalrelated molecules such as TAZ/YAP, and tumor suppressor gene Merlin (neurofibromatosis type 2) binds to the tight junction protein PATJ. 41",

At present, we cannot draw any conclusion about the relationship between claudin expression and human cancer because the expression occurs in a cell type-specific fashion. In addition, like claudin-7, 23 claudin-3 and -8 are representatively detected on lateral membranes as well as in tight junction regions. These claudins localized on the basolateral surface might have unknown roles in cell functions in addition to forming tight junctions. Further characterization of each member of the claudin family and immunostaining panels for various human cancers are required to elucidate why claudin expression is changed regardless of tight junction formation, 5 Are tight junctions really suppressive of tumorigenesis? Possibly, yes. However, the above-mentioned findings show that loss of tight junctions in cancer cells is a secondary and/or late event of carcinogenesis, though tight junctions are considered to be deeply involved in tumorigenesis and invasion. On the other hand, tight junctions of endothelial and mesothelial cells of the host possibly act as a barrier against disordered migration leading to metastasis and dissemination of cancer cells.

In contrast to opening of tight junctions, it is theoretically possible that closing tight junctions could result in selective uptake of materials via a transcellular pathway like the BBB.

The surprising advances are considerably due to the outstanding contributions of Dr Shoichiro Tsukita and his colleagues who discovered occludin and tricellulin, as well as the claudin family. He proposed the field of Barriology, based on the barrier function of tight junctions. Until recently, research on tight junctions was exclusively on the fence and barrier functions at the cellular level. Now it is becoming clear that tight junctions are deeply involved in immunity. However, the study of this issue is still in the early stage. With advances in this area, tight junction research may contribute to the development of drugs, vaccination and drug delivery systems. Further extensive study is required to clarify the issues concerning tight junction functions. 5 On the other hand, each of the tight junction proteins, in particular each of the claudins, may play distinct roles in cell biology in addition to the formation of tight junctions. This issue should be also clarified. The author declares that the research was conducted in the absence of any commercial or financial relationships that could be construed as a potential conflict of interest.",
