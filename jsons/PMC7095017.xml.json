            "text": "The technique of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) for patients with severe acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) involves placing them on a venovenous or venoarterial life-support circuit with a membrane oxygenator to temporarily take over the gas exchange and, sometimes, cardiac function [1]. Over the last two decades, the technique has progressed significantly, and several studies have reported encouraging survival rates using mainly venovenous ECMO in adults with ARDS [2\u20138]. Recently, an ECMO-based management protocol for selected ARDS patients transferred to a referral center was shown to improve 6-month disability-free survival [9, 10]. However, owing to recent advances in the management of ARDS [11, 12], ECMO remains a salvage therapy in a limited number of patients with life-threatening hypoxemia or respiratory acidosis [13]. Moreover, because of its additional costs and the need for trained expertise [14, 15], a rational allocation of this limited resource is critical, and indications must be further explored. ECMO centers have developed and have long been associated with mobile units that retrieve patients from distant hospitals immediately after cannulation [16, 17]. Approximately half of the patients treated with ECMO for ARDS are cannulated in distant hospitals and transported on ECMO [4, 18, 19]. For these patients, the decision to initiate ECMO is often made by phone and is based on the severity of respiratory failure, which is often evaluated by blood gas results or the lung injury score [20, 21]. Although some patients do not present with other organ failures, most of them present with septic shock and associated organ dysfunction. Because they may contribute significantly to ECMO outcomes, an understanding of the impact of preexisting organ dysfunction on ECMO-associated mortality is helpful in modifying the current strategies of ECMO in the resuscitation of these high-risk patients [5]. In the present study, we evaluated early prognostic factors in ARDS patients treated with ECMO in distant hospitals by our mobile team and brought to our center during a 3-year period. The goal was to establish simple decision rules that could aid the clinician in the decision regarding whether to treat patients with ECMO.",

We prospectively included all consecutive adult patients treated with ECMO in distant hospitals (a 31,400-km2 region) by our mobile team and immediately brought to our center between October 2009 and March 2013. Only patients with ARDS were included. Patients treated with ECMO as a bridge to or following lung transplantation or any surgery were not included.

The indication was discussed with one of three referees from our center who were contactable 24/7 through a hotline. A standardized form including ventilatory and blood gas parameters and sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score parameters was prospectively completed. Before consideration for ECMO, patients were all sedated using continuous neuromuscular blockade [11] and ventilated with volume-controlled ventilation using a tidal volume (Vt) of 5\u20137 ml/kg of predicted body weight. ECMO therapy was indicated if patients presented a PaO2 to FiO2 ratio of less than 70 mmHg for at least 6 h under an FiO2 of 1 and a PEEP level adjusted to obtain a plateau pressure (Pplat) of 30 cmH2O, a PaO2 to FiO2 ratio of less than 100 mmHg associated with a Pplat value greater than 35 cmH2O, or respiratory acidosis with pH less than 7.15 despite a respiratory rate greater than 35/min. Absolute contraindications included the following: any contraindication to heparin treatment, a chronic disease expected to be fatal within 5 years, a SOFA score greater than 18, and age over 70 years. The SOFA score [23] was always precisely calculated before ECMO consideration. When feasible in the referring hospital, prone positioning was systematically performed before considering ECMO. Relative contraindications were body mass index (BMI) greater than 40 kg/m2 and duration of ARDS greater than 7 days.",

Echocardiography was performed in all patients before cannulation and each day under ECMO. This procedure enabled venoarterial cannulation to be performed initially or later in patients presenting with left heart failure on the basis of echocardiography, defined as a less than 30 % left ventricular ejection fraction. We used centrifugal pumps (Bio-console 560; Medtronic Perfusion Systems, Minneapolis, MN, USA) with a flow of 3\u20135 l/min in all patients. Circuits were heparin-coated and composed of Quadrox D with Bioline Coating oxygenators (Maquet, Hirrlingen, Germany), 20\u201325 Fr cannulae (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine, CA, USA), and intersept polyvinyl chloride (PVC) class VI tubing (Medtronic). Initial ventilator settings were as follows: Pplat, 20\u201330 cmH2O; PEEP, 15\u201320 cmH2O; respiratory rate, 5\u201310 breaths/min; and FiO2 adjusted to obtain an arterial O2 saturation of 90\u201395 %, whereas the FiO2 was set at 1 on the oxygenator. The patients were transferred to our ICU immediately after ECMO initiation by a team comprising one physician from our ICU, the cardiac surgeon who cannulated the patient, and a perfusionist. Continuous heparin infusion maintained the activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) at 40\u201350 s. The triggering limits for transfusion were 50 \u00d7 103/ml for platelets and 10 g/dl for hemoglobin. ECMO was continued until lung recovery or until irreversible multiorgan failure leading to death. Patients were weaned from venovenous ECMO when the following criteria were met: PaO2 to FiO2 ratio greater than 150 mmHg with PEEP less than 12 cmH2O, Pplat less than 32 cmH2O with a Vt of 5\u20137 ml/kg, FiO2 of 0.21 on ECMO, blood flow of 1 l/min, and gas flow of 1 l/min.",

The severity of the illness was assessed based on the simplified acute physiology score (SAPS) II [24] at ICU admission and the SOFA [23] score before ECMO initiation and at days 1, 3, and 7 of ECMO. The neurological score was calculated on the basis of the Glasgow coma scale just before intubation. Biological parameters were obtained in the 3 h preceding cannulation for all patients. The number of ECMO-free days at day 28 was defined as the number of days alive and free from ECMO at this time point.",

Briefly, RPA accepts predictor and response values as the inputs. As the output, this function generates a decision tree using a recursive partitioning algorithm. Each partitioning step selects the tree-branching criterion based on the predictor variables that will split the parent data set into two daughter data sets, with the daughter sets being as \u201cpure\u201d (homogeneous) as possible as approximated according to a heuristic. Here, purity is measured with the Gini statistic with respect to the response variable, such that the more homogeneous a daughter set, the higher the purity. Partition steps are repeated, adding branches to the tree, until the subgroups reach a minimum size or until no improvement can be obtained. Firstly, the significant variables in the multivariate logistic regression were selected into an RPA to build a decision tree. Then the optimal cutoff in the tree associated with each variable was used to transform the continuous variables into categorical variables (named partial score\\documentclass[12pt]{minimal}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsmath}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{wasysym} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsfonts} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amssymb} \n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{amsbsy}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{mathrsfs}\n\t\t\t\t\\usepackage{upgreek}\n\t\t\t\t\\setlength{\\oddsidemargin}{-69pt}\n\t\t\t\t\\begin{document}$$ {\\text{ps}}_{i} $$\\end{document}psi). With the aim to be as intuitive as possible, the score was constructed to give a result between 0 and 4 where 0 is a lower risk of hospital mortality and 4 a higher risk.

Lastly, Kaplan\u2013Meier survival analysis was used to estimate the probability of survival after ECMO initiation for groups under and over the best cutoff value of the score. The log-rank test was used. Statistical analysis was performed using the SPSS statistics 20 software.",

Patients\u2019 demographic characteristics are provided in Table 1. No patient had a history of chronic heart, renal, or respiratory insufficiency. The main cause of ARDS was documented as community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (n = 30). Twenty patients presented with influenza pneumonia, 12 of whom had been treated in the first half of the study period. The median (interquartile range) time between contact from the referring hospital and patient cannulation was 3 (1\u20134) h; transfer to our center occurred within 6 (3\u20137) h. No serious complications (including vascular or chest tube displacement, ECMO malfunction, cardiac arrest, or death) occurred during transport by our mobile unit. For venovenous ECMO, femoral\u2013jugular vein cannulation was performed in 62 patients, and femoral\u2013femoral cannulation was performed in 15 patients. Femoral\u2013femoral cannulation was performed in the eight patients treated with venoarterial ECMO. In all cases, venoarterial ECMO was used for left heart failure and severe shock complicating ARDS-associated disease. Prior to ECMO, all patients had refractory hypoxemia, 20 had a PaCO2 greater than 70 mmHg, and 29 had an arterial pH less than 7.2.\n\n",

Forty-two nonsurvivors died during therapy after a median (range) of 9 (1\u201353) days of ECMO, and 6 of them died after successful ECMO weaning after a median (range) of 8 (5\u201310) days of ECMO. Survivors had a median (range) duration of ECMO therapy of 10 (3\u201325) days and were mechanically ventilated for a median (interquartile range) duration of 28 (24\u201335) days. After univariate analysis, factors potentially collected before ECMO that were associated with hospital mortality were age, SOFA score, lactate level, and a diagnosis of influenza pneumonia (Table 2). SAPS II was not considered for multivariate analysis because it could not constantly be obtained at this time and because SOFA score is easier to use at the bedside. Age, SOFA score, and a diagnosis of influenza pneumonia were introduced into the logistic regression analysis, which showed that these three parameters were independently associated with hospital mortality. Mortality increased with age [OR 1.045, CI (1.008; 1.083), p = 0.017] and SOFA score [OR 1.267, CI (1.053; 1.525), p = 0.01] whereas a diagnosis of influenza pneumonia was associated with a lower risk of death [OR 0.202, CI (0.061; 0.67), p = 0.009]. Lactate level was not introduced into the multivariate analysis because it was not available for all patients in the 3 h before considering ECMO. The distribution of SOFA subscores just before ECMO is presented in Fig. 2. Hemodynamic and liver scores were higher in nonsurvivors (p = 0.03 and p = 0.04, respectively).\n\n",

Of note, most of our patients had pneumonia with severe septic shock requiring vasopressors, and half of them required renal replacement therapy during the ICU stay, which has been shown to have an important prognostic impact in ECMO patients [31, 32]. Moreover, mortality rate is most likely largely influenced by indications and contraindications defined by each center. In the present study, indications were quite liberal regarding the evolution of organ dysfunctions, making it possible to accurately evaluate their prognostic impact. To date, decision criteria given for ECMO initiation in guidelines and studies are still undefined. Nevertheless, a recent study [18] showed that the application of new criteria based on Extracorporeal Life Support Organization (ELSO) guidelines [33] resulted in a higher mortality compared with previous criteria used at the same center, suggesting a strong influence of these criteria on the reported outcomes.",

The SOFA score is simple to calculate and has been validated as a marker of organ dysfunction and of mortality in large multicenter studies in different patient populations [36]. In a cohort of 45 patients treated with ECMO for respiratory or heart failure, Wu et al. [29] suggested the prognostic value of SOFA calculated before ECMO. Recently, Lindskov et al. [18] showed that the SOFA score calculated at day 1 after ECMO initiation was predictive of death. In this latter study, a SOFA score of 10 or less was associated with 90 % survival. In the study by Wu et al. [29], the mean SOFA score before ECMO was 14 \u00b1 4 in ARDS patients, whereas it was 10 \u00b1 3 in our study. However, as in the study by Lindskov et al. [18], SOFA was not calculated in the same way as in the present study. Notably, the Glasgow coma scale score was set arbitrarily to 2 points. No patient presented with impaired consciousness at the time of sedation in our study, resulting in a 0-point neurological score in all patients. Pappalardo et al. [19] proposed a prognostic score in patients with H1N1-associated ARDS treated with ECMO that was based on biological and clinical data similar to the data used to determine the SOFA score. More recently, Schmidt et al. [35] proposed a prognostic score in ARDS patients treated with ECMO in which SOFA had a quite similar weight to that in the present study.",

Our 30 % mortality rate is in agreement with recent studies in patients with influenza H1N1-associated ARDS treated with ECMO [19, 37]. Our results also confirm those of previous observational studies suggesting that patients treated with ECMO for influenza pneumonia have a lower risk of death than patients presenting with other causes of ARDS [2]. However, no study had previously clearly shown a protective effect of influenza in ECMO patients. Unfortunately, the diagnosis of influenza is inconsistently confirmed but rather suspected at the time the ECMO decision is made. Therefore, this parameter cannot be taken into account in all patients when making ECMO decisions. Of note, all patients in our study who had confirmed influenza had been suspected of having influenza at ECMO initiation, and only three patients with suspected influenza were not confirmed.",
