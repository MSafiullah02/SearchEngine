In the present study, we cloned an intracellular domain segment of human kidney NaDC-3, which is 75% identical to that of the rat, constructed a polyclonal antibody against fusion protein of glutathione S-transferase (GST)-NaDC-3, and detected its renal expression changes with aging in both Wistar rats and normal humans. Western blot and immunohistochemistry confirmed the specificity of the antibody, and its location was found to be on the basolateral membrane of the renal proximal tubule. In addition, Western and Northern blots showed that NaDC-3 in kidneys significantly increased with age in Wistar rats. In healthy humans, renal NaDC-3 abundance also increased with age. Our results demonstrated that NaDC-3 expression was increased in aged Wistar rats and aged people, indicating that NaDC-3 may have a role in the process of kidney aging.",

            "text": "S ODIUM-DEPENDENT dicarboxylate cotransporter (NaDC) is in a family of transmembrane proteins that are responsible for transportation of intermediates of Krebs cycle, such as succinate, a-ketoglutarate, and citrate (1) . NaDC family members were mainly distributed in vital organs of the body, such as the kidney, liver, brain, and placenta. It has been demonstrated that there are at least two types of NaDC in the kidney according to their affinities for the substrates. NaDC-1 has a lower affinity and is located in the brush border of the renal proximal tubule of the kidney, while NaDC-3 has a higher affinity and is in the basolateral membrane of the proximal tubule (2) . NaDC members can be involved in energy metabolism, secretion of organic anions, regulation of the acid-base balance, metabolism of amino acid, synthesis of glucocorticoid, and can also play a part in the pathogenesis of nephrolithiasis (3) (4) (5) (6) .",

At present, knowledge of the NaDC family is very limited, especially of NaDC-3. Apart from its involvement in transportation, NaDC-3 is rarely known for its other functions, such as in the aging process of rats and humans. In the present study, we hypothesize that NaDC-3 expression may have changes during the aging process. So for the first time, we established a polyclonal antibody against human NaDC-3-GST (glutathione-S-transferase) fusion protein, whose sequence has very high homology with that of the rat, and detected NaDC-3 expression in the kidney tissues of both aging rats and aging humans in order to explore its relationship with aging.",

Since aging is an extremely complex, multifactorial process, numerous aging theories have been proposed; the most important of these are probably the genomic and free radical theories. Although it is abundantly clear that our genes influence aging and longevity, exactly how this takes place still remains to be elucidated. There is considerable evidence supporting the free radical theory of aging (10) . At present, caloric restriction is the only known method that increases the life span (11) . Caloric restriction not only down-regulates free radical and lipid peroxide production (12) , but also lowers body temperature in rhesus monkeys (13) . The mitochondrial respiratory chain is a powerful source of reactive oxygen species, considered the pathogenic agent of aging (14) . The tricarboxylic acid cycle, also called the citric acid cycle or Krebs cycle, is a major biochemical pathway that is localized to the mitochondrial matrix (15) , which is considered the most efficient way for aerobic organisms to produce energy. As NaDC is responsible for transportation of intermediates of the Krebs cycle including succinate, aketoglutarate, and citrate (1), it can be deduced that NaDC may be involved in the process of aging, for which Rogina and colleagues have provided evidence (7) .",

Thus, by means of analysis with biotechnological software, we established a peptide in the N-terminal intracellular domain as the immunogen. To Figure 12 .

All the above advantages allowed the NaDC-3 to be stably translated. By continually exploring the effects of IPTG concentrations, reaction temperature, and induction time of protein expression, we finally obtained the optimal conditions for IPTG to induce highly efficient soluble fusion protein expression. We finally obtained the antibody by using the purified fusion protein GST-hNaDC-3 as the immunogen. Substantial evidence showed that the anti-hNaDC-3 antibody specifically recognized the natural antigen. Our results have demonstrated for the first time, at the level of renal tissue expression, that hNaDC-3 was mainly located in the basolateral membrane of the renal proximal tubule, while hNaDC-1 was mainly expressed in the brush border membrane of the proximal tubule. An interesting observation is that NaDC-3 protein expression increased with age in rats as well as in humans. As NaDC-3 uptakes citrate and succinate, and so forth, into the basolateral membrane of renal proximal tubule epithelial cells to enter the mitochondria for providing energy (4), this increase of NaDC-3 may have a role in promoting aging, even although the exact mechanism of it has not yet been discovered. Rogina and colleagues (7) reported that the insertion mutation of the Indy gene, which has approximately 50% homology with NaDC-3, doubled the life span of drosophila, with no changes in the procreation ability and other physical activities, providing indirect support to our findings.",
