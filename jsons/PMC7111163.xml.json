The influenza A subtype H1\u2013H15 amplification primers and capture probe were derived after comparison of the conserved sequences of the matrix protein (M) gene obtained from viruses of avian, human, swine, and equine origin. The conserved sequences were selected by sequence alignment of more than 300 M gene sequences retrieved from the GenBank database (National Center of Biotechnology Information, NCBI). Sequence alignments were performed using CLUSTALX software [35]. To further subtype avian influenza viruses using NASBA, we designed H5- and H7-specific amplification primers and capture probes, each based on the conserved sequences of the haemagglutinin genes of these subtypes. Over 100 haemagglutinin gene sequences were retrieved from GenBank for each subtype of avian, human, swine, and equine origin. The H5-ECL and H7-ECL amplification primers each contain two degenerate nucleotides resulting in a mixture of four possible oligonucleotide sequences (Table 1). The H5-T7 and H7-T7 amplification primers each contain two degenerate nucleotides, including inosine, resulting in a mixture of two possible oligonucleotide sequences. The AIV-T7 amplification primer contains three degenerate nucleotides resulting in a mixture of eight possible sequences. The H5-CP capture probe contains two degenerate nucleotides resulting in a mixture of four possible sequences. Two different H7-CP capture probes were designed. H7-CP-1 contains two degenerate nucleotides, producing six possible sequences, while H7-CP-2 contains a single degenerate nucleotide resulting in two possible H7-CP-2 sequences, respectively. The amplification primer and capture probe sequences for each subtype assay are shown in Table 1.",

It is not intended to compare these NASBA-based methods with other technologies, for example real-time PCR, which have been described elsewhere [24], [25], [26]. The economic consequences of avian influenza, as evidenced in the 2003 outbreak of HPAI H7N7 in the Netherlands, demand a rapid, sensitive, and accurate diagnostic test be readily available. The NASBA-H5 assay described here was previously evaluated using tissue samples (viscera and blood) from chickens experimentally infected with highly pathogenic A/chicken/Hong Kong/1000/97 (H5N1) [28]. The samples gave positive results with the NASBA H5-specific primers [28]. In other studies conducted in our laboratories, cloacal and tracheal samples collected from a dead chicken infected with HPAI subtype H5N1 during an outbreak in Hong Kong in 2002 were examined using the NASBA-H5 assay. Freshly extracted RNA from the cloacal and tracheal samples generated positive results (data not shown). In addition, the NASBA-H5 assay has also utilized avian influenza strains propagated in embryonated fowl\u2019s eggs. Therefore, the NASBA-H5 assay is an efficient method for the direct amplification of viral nucleic acid from both tissue and cultured samples.",

The NASBA assays described here are rapid molecular techniques for the detection of influenza A virus (NASBA-AIV), subtype H7 (NASBA-H7), and subtype H5 (NASBA-H5) in veterinary samples. Using these assays, an accurate identification of influenza A and subtype H7 or H5 can be made within 6 h. The amplification primers and capture probes are specific to AIV, H7 or H5, and do not cross-react with other haemagglutinin subtypes, phylogenetically related viruses containing haemagglutinin-like molecules, or other clinically relevant pathogens (Table 4, Table 5, Table 6).",

NASBA/ECL is especially suitable for the detection of RNA viruses, such as influenza, foot-and-mouth disease virus, dengue fever virus, human immunodeficiency virus, and cytomegalovirus, among many others [27], [29], [36], [37], [38], [39]. As the end-product of the NASBA reaction is RNA, which tends to be unstable under normal environmental conditions, the possibility of carryover contamination of equipment from previous experiments is minimized. The NASBA assay, like other nucleic acid-based technologies, has the ability to detect whole infectious particles in addition to partially degraded, non-infectious or mis-packaged virions [25].",

The NASBA/ECL assays were 10- to 1000-fold more sensitive than commercially available antigen-capture immunoassay and more sensitive than conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods (data not shown). PCR can amplify DNA greater than 1\u00d7107-fold while NASBA can amplify RNA 1\u00d7109-fold [31]. Using H7N1 or H5N3 RNA extracts as targets for amplification, the NASBA-AIV, H7, and H5 were comparable in sensitivity with egg culture, which is the currently accepted \u201cgold standard\u201d for virus detection. The NASBA/ECL detection system is highly automated, resulting in fewer handling errors and contributing to an increase in sensitivity and specificity. The target-specific capture probes and generic ECL detection probes hybridize with the complementary amplified target molecules, thus increasing assay specificity during the detection stage. NASBA/ECL has a relatively high throughput, as many as 50 samples can be processed in the ECL reader at the same time. Therefore, it may be a suitable assay to use for routine screening methods, such as in cross-border or poultry market surveillance operations involving analysis of multiple samples simultaneously. The requirements for sample format are extremely robust and swabs taken from cages, work surfaces, clothing, utensils, and litter are suitable for analysis as are tissue samples taken from suspect animals or products from in vitro amplification. This extends the use of the NASBA/ECL method to monitor decontaminated premises or equipment prior to re-stocking with livestock",

The same sample was analysed using the NASBA-AIV assay and yielded a positive result (Table 4). Thus, the failure of the NASBA-H7 assay with respect to this sample was not due to sample degradation. Further analysis of the A/equine/Prague/1/56 H gene sequence (GenBank, X62552) indicated that the H7 amplification primers and capture probe contain several mismatches, probably resulting in a low-efficiency amplification and signal detection for this particular subtype.",
