Previous susceptible-infected models are extended to allow for a latent period between initial exposure to the pathogen and the patient becoming themselves infectious, and the possibility of decolonization. We allow for multiple facilities, such as acute care hospitals or long-term care facilities and nursing homes, and for multiple units or wards within a facility. Patient transfers between units and facilities are tracked and accounted for in the models so that direct importation of a colonized individual from one facility or unit to another might be inferred. We allow for constant transmission rates, rates that depend on the number of colonized individuals in a unit or facility, or rates that depend on the proportion of colonized individuals. Statistical analysis is done in a Bayesian framework using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods to obtain a sample of parameter values from their joint posterior distribution. Cross validation, deviance information criterion and widely applicable information criterion approaches to model choice fit very naturally into this framework and we have implemented all three.

For instance, is acquisition of a pathogen a consequence of direct patient to patient contact, is it mediated by health care workers, or is it the result of general environmental contamination? Hospitals routinely collect and maintain extensive records of patient admission and discharge times to and from wards and units, and records are also available for the sample times and results of laboratory tests to detect pathogens colonizing and infecting patients. Colonization generally refers to the situation where bacteria are living on the skin or in other body sites without causing disease. Our usage of the term also refers to the state in which an individual is shedding an organism and capable of transmitting to others, i.e. is infectious. Clinical infection is disease caused by a microorganism. For bacteria that cause nosocomial infection, colonization typically precedes clinical infection. Because we do not analyse clinical data here, we are unable to distinguish asymptomatic colonization from clinical infection. The ultimate objective of our work is to reduce the rates of nosocomial infection. Hospital records have been used in a variety of ways to estimate rates of colonization and hence measure the effect of interventions designed to reduce acquisition rates. Our work focuses on patient level models as opposed to compartmental models (Cooper & Lipsitch, 2004; McBryde et al., 2007) , and is thus very much in the vein of Forrester et al. (2007) and Cooper et al. (2008) , and more recently, Kypraios et al. (2010) , Worby et al. (2013) and Haverkate et al. (2015) . Patient level nosocomial infection modelling is a classical hidden variable statistical problem: although swab tests and admission data are informative, the precise time of colonization is very unlikely to be observed. Cooper et al. (2008) briefly reviewed previous attempts to address the problem before introducing an augmented data approach. In this, the observed data are augmented by the unobservable times of colonization, the values of which are repeatedly imputed based on current parameter values and the observed data. The imputations and parameter updates are made using Markov chain Monte Carlo stochastic integration (MCMC) which, with care, ensures that the parameter values so generated constitute a correlated sample from the posterior densities of the parameters in a Bayesian analysis. These methods can typically also be adapted for stochastic optimization to find maximum likelihood or maximum posterior estimates, but we will not consider this further in this work.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1483, "end": 1508, "text": "(Cooper & Lipsitch, 2004;", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 1509, "end": 1530, "text": "McBryde et al., 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1570, "end": 1593, "text": "Forrester et al.

The model assumption that the infectious state never resolves conflicts with the current body of knowledge about the nature of colonization. Substantial empirical evidence has accumulated that a variety of types of bacteria which colonize human hosts, including MRSA, can be lost and reacquired during follow-up (Huckabee et al., 2009; Haverkate et al., 2014; Shenoy et al., 2014) . Rather than assuming that every negative surveillance test that occurs after a positive test is always a false negative, it is much more realistic to i30 EXTENDED MODELS FOR NOSOCOMIAL INFECTION allow the possibility of decolonization. For the most part, information for estimating the decolonization rate comes from tests done on patients with previous positives tests, hence, this will be better estimated under a regime of regular surveillance testing. Incorporating a latent period enhances the realism of the model as, in nature, there is always some lag between transmission and onset of infectiousness in the newly colonized host. For SIS and SEIS models the number of transitions in different imputations of the augmented data can vary, and, thus, so will the dimensionality of the problem.

The movements of patients between units and time spent outside of any unit are tracked and the colonization status at readmission will depend on the status at previous discharge and the time between these events. A two-or three-state continuous time Markov process is used to model the out of facility colonization process depending on whether or not the model allows for a latent state. Models that assume that no patients are hospitalized more than once fail to account for the reality that readmission occurs with appreciable frequency. The reason this simplifying assumption is problematic is that readmission provides the key link between past transmission and future importation. The notion that this is an epidemiologically important relationship has received support in previous studies of MRSA colonization (Jones et al., 2015) : lagged facility-level MRSA acquisition was found to be temporally correlated with admission prevalence. The out of unit decolonization rate is informed by the colonization status on readmission for patients likely to have been colonized on their discharge, and will decrease at the the time interval between hospitalization increases.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 915, "end": 935, "text": "(Jones et al., 2015)", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Introduction"}, {"text": "We also introduce a new parameter for the probability that a patient in the unit at the onset of the study is colonized.

We make the slight extension from leave one out cross validation to a version that allows for arbitrary sets of tests to be omitted in the estimation phase before being predicted. Celeux et al. (2006) consider several possible versions of the DIC for missing data problems which treat the augmented variables variously as data or parameters. As the DIC requires calculation of deviances under fixed parameter estimates, we find it inappropriate in a context where the augmented variables are complete patient histories rather than simple numerical quantities, so that using a posterior mean estimate for example is not well defined. We, therefore, have chosen to implement what Celeux et al. (2006) refer to as DIC 6 , a version that treats the augmented variables as data. We also consider the widely applicable, or Watanabe-Akaike, information criteria (WAIC) (Watanabe, 2010) . This has the computational attraction of being calculable from statistics generated in the course of the simulation run for parameter estimation, thus, unlike cross validation and DIC it requires minimal additional effort.

The posterior predictive probabilities needed to calculate either version of the WAIC were also estimated from these 4000 simulations. We then made a further run of 4000 simulations that were used to compute the differences between deviances under the simulated parameter values and the overall mean parameter values as required for the DIC. DIC and WAIC results are presented in Table 3 . Two versions of the WAIC Table 4 gives the estimates for the test false negative probability, the in situ status probabilities, and the state probabilities for the limiting case of the out of unit process for each model. Table 5 gives the estimates for the in unit colonization process rates. For each model, a separate series of MCMC samples was generated in order to calculate the cross validation score.

Overall, the rank correlation between the two is 76%. Reassuringly, the 2 WAIC statistics give the models identical rankings, and correlate almost perfectly, so at least in this context, either is equally applicable. In contrast to the LCVPP and WAIC, the DIC favours SIS over SEIS over SI models with mean ranks 8.0, 5.8 and 14.7.

The LCVPP ranks the SEIS unit specific constant colonization rate as the best overall and ranks it best of the 3 models in each category. The WAIC ranks the SEIS facility wide constant colonization rate model as the best overall. This brings into question somewhat the thinking behind the density and frequency dependent colonization assumptions. These are intended to model colonization by direct contact between colonized and susceptible patients when the number of potential interactions either grows linearly with the number of patients in the unit or is constant. Transmission of bacteria between patients is believed to be mediated primarily by contact involving healthcare workers and environmental surfaces rather than direct contact between patients, indeed, in many settings, particularly ICUs, patients are not mobile, so direct patient contact is unlikely. Thus, the environment can serve as a reservoir for acquisition after discharge or transfer of colonized i41 patients. This likely depends on the cumulative recent history of colonized individuals in the unit, not simply on the instantaneous total. In modelling terms, it seems that there should be some lag in the system suggesting that moving average or other time series approaches should be investigated. A further factor may be that the mass action principle is less demonstrable if the prevalence or density of carriage shows little variation over time, and that distinguishing between frequency dependent and density dependent models will be difficult unless there is substantial variation in occupancy. Figure 1 shows that for the larger units, while there is substantial high frequency variation, occupancy numbers are generally stable, as are prevalence of carriage. Units 5, 6 and 7 show more variability, and some evidence of discrete outbreaks, however, the low numbers here limit statistical power. We conclude that because of the rarity of transmissions, distinguishing decisively between modes of transmission will require a larger study. The LCVPP shows clear support for unit specific colonization rates, the top 3 models all being unit specific SEIS. The LCVPP also generally favours unit specific rates within SI and SIS categories. This is supported by a broad range of rate estimates across the units, as shown in Table 5 . Neither the DIC nor the WAIC, however, follow the same pattern. We also note that rate estimates correlate strongly and negatively with the size of the unit. There are far fewer observations on which to base rate estimates in the smaller units, and hence these have far larger posterior standard deviations. As these distributions are asymmetric the larger variability seems to also pull up the posterior mean. This suggests that using log normal priors, where the mean and variance can change independently, may be more appropriate although this, being non-conjugate, complicates computation. Cooper et al. (2008) used the log normal as did Khader et al. (2017) in an application of hierarchical modelling to compare colonization rates in a multi-unit intervention trial. We also note that unit 7 draws most of its patients from outside the system, thus, any positive tests observed there cannot be attributed to transfers from other units. Again, given the scarcity of transmissions, larger samples will be needed to overcome the influence of the priors and better evaluate evidence for different colonization rates in the units.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 2964, "end": 2984, "text": "Cooper et al.

The largest effect is that the false-negative test probability is larger for the SI models. Since, under these models, any negative test following a positive test must be a false negative, this is not surprising. Single While we have not made a formal analysis of Table 2 , and note that for brevity we have curtailed the sequence runs at 5, informal inspection reveals more sequences that follow the positive-negative pattern, favouring decolonization, than follow the positive-negative-positive pattern that would more strongly favour a higher false-negative rate. The average time spent in the latent state in SEIS models ranges from around 0.9 days for the constant model to around 3.2 days for the density dependent model. Estimates for the mean latent period for the outpatient process were broadly in line but showed more variability ranging from 0.8 to 13.1 days. Given that no data is collected during outpatient periods, the increased variability is not surprising. Although we consider the latency between colonization and detectability or infectiousness, as opposed to the more usual latency between acquisition and clinical infection, we would expect these to be of comparable magnitude and our estimates are consistent with what is known about MRSA (Dancer et al., 2006) . Nonetheless, we hesitate to interpret these estimates too directly. It may be that any improvement in predictive power of the SEIS model over the SIS is less to do with the existence of a latent state per se, and more to do with the slight lag it introduces into the system as discussed above. The correlation of the LCVPP with the WAIC is far better than with the DIC, and given that the WAIC can be calculated at the same time as the parameter posterior samples are generated, we see no reason to pursue the DIC any further in this context. However, there is enough disagreement between LCVPP and WAIC that, despite theoretical results of asymptotic equivalence and ease of computation, the additional effort required for cross validation by decimation is indeed worthwhile, and the LCVPP statistic remains the best basis for model selection.

Thus,Hence, provided we can evaluate the polynomial r, we will have an explicit formula for f (Q).
