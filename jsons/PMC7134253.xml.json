Hernandez Munoz et al. were cited 94 times [30], Angelidou [18] was cited 85 times and Mahizhnan [4] 79 times in database Web of Science. Sources as Cities with 562 citations, book Future Internet: Future Internet Assembly 2011: Achievements and Technological Promises with 94 citations, IEEE communications magazine with 60 citations, Applied Energy with 53 and Business Process Management Journal with 43 citations are the most often cited. Topic is the most often solved in Italy, Spain, USA and India. Smart city, cities, city, governance, innovation, smart cities, economy, technology and big data are the most often published keywords connected with topic Smart city and economy. According to above mentioned words and done analysis is Smart city also often connected with keywords technology, urbanization, growth, sharing economy, future, model, politics, sustainability, urban governance, internet of things and open innovation. The creation of smart cities is a motivator for growth, new jobs and is a productive investment in future, leading to a sustainable and environmentally friendly economy. Well-arranged pictures presented in this paper demonstrate the research achievements in the domain of the smart city and economy, which could help researchers, practitioners and mayors and politics to identify the underlying impacts from authors, journals, countries, institutions, references, and research topics.",
