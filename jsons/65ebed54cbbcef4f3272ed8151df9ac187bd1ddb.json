Consequently, what I am about to say will likely not be taken with appreciation by the majority in the restaurant or retail wine trades. Nonetheless, fools, prophets (and occasionally scientists) often go where angels fear to tread. The author has already dared to comment on this topic at greater length in another work (Jackson, 2009) . His head has a yet to roll, so one more, foreshortened, sortie into the topic may still be safe, buried as it is within a scientific text. It is added to give food for thought to those seriously inter ested in wine, and how it is most commonly used (or at least portrayed) in society.",

However, when one searches for the evidence, it seems to be a myth -a view that has been so oft repeated as to be assumed to be true, an example of social conta gion of collective memory. The food/wine association only begins to appear in the literature during ancient Greek or Roman times. In the Near East and Egypt, wine was almost the exclusive preserve of the noble or priestly classes. The alcoholic beverage of the populace was beer. Wine is mentioned in the Bible, but seemingly recommended only in relation to religious ceremonies and weddings. It is only in regions where wild grapes grow indigenously that vines came to provide the drink for the masses. Its acidity, alcohol, and phenolic con tents all enhanced its antimicrobial property, making it considerably safer to drink than water. This property of wine became increasingly important as population numbers grew, and hygienic conditions correspondingly deteriorated. Although production was seasonal (unlike beer based on a dry grain), its resistance to spoilage for several months, isolated from air, permitted it to become the preferred beverage where vines grew read ily. Like beer, it could wash down food, and obliterate, for a short period, the afflictions of rigorous lives. Although safe and nutritious (caloric), there is nothing in its attributes that inherently makes wine ideal as a food beverage. It is actually better suited for its ancient secondary role, as a solvent in preparing extracts from medical herbs.",

These characteristics are simply the natural consequence of grape chemistry, not conscious intent. Admittedly, consuming wine with food does mollify its less pleasant aspects, unless one develops an appreciation for sour beverages with a bitter/astringent aspect. Some humans seem adept at coming to appre ciate and crave what is initially abhorrent. Black cof fee, capsicum peppers, and limberger cheese are classic examples. The mutual tapering of the sensation of both cheese and wine appears to be the major benefit of their combination at wine tastings (Nygren et al., 2002 (Nygren et al., , 2003a (Nygren et al., , 2003b . Other studies have confirmed these findings, as well as lending support to the idea that red wines marginally pair better with cheeses, with astrin gency being reduced and the perception of tannins appearing more silky (Bastian et al., 2010) .",

            "text": "In some instances, the iron content of the wine can induce a metallic sensation, by catalyzing lipid oxida tion. This may be masked in combination with food. However, iron is considered to induce the fishy after taste associated with some white wines paired with seafood (Tamura et al., 2009) . In most 'compatible' combinations, both the cheese and wine appear betternot by enhancing their respective qualities, as usu ally interpreted, but by a mutual suppression of their less pleasing attributes. For example, the fatty acids in cheese, by coating taste receptors, reduce their expo sure to wine acids and phenolics. Lipoproteins, typically found in foods, are known to react with hydrophobic regions of receptor membranes, suppressing the percep tion of bitterness (Katsuragi et al., 1995) . Suppression of unpleasantness of either component could eas ily be misinterpreted as an enhancement in pleasureequating to compatibility. Similar situations could explain many other supposedly compatible food and wine associations. This is not what wine pundits and sommeliers profess, but seems far closer to the truth. When one searches for commonalities among the attributes of food and wine, they are few and far between. Most table wines are distinctly on the sour side. This can be of value when wine is used as a marinade, promoting acidinduced hydrolysis of food proteins. As a marinade, wine antioxidants can also reduce the production of toxic heterocyclic amines dur ing frying (Viegas et al., 2012) . Otherwise, sourness is rare as a principal element in most world cuisines (see Moskowitz et al., 1975 for a marked exception). Acids typically are added only as a component in some con diments or flavorants, notably vinegar, lemon juice, or tamarind. They can enhance the flavor of otherwise bland foods. The bitterness and astringency of most red wines also finds no equivalent in meat or fish. Taking food with wine does, however, reduce both its sour and bitter/astringent attributes. The protein in solid food reacts with both wine acids and phenolics, limiting their availability to react with and stimulate gustatory receptors and trigeminal nerve endings.",

If this view has a physicochemical basis, the partial fat solubility of ethanol may reduce the oily mouthfeel of fats, as well as limit the activation of taste receptors to fatty acids, but this is no more than speculation. The acids in wine might also have a similar effect. In addition, wine tannins might denature the G protein receptors responsible for detecting fatty acids in the oral epithelium (see Chapter 11), giving the impression of less fattiness. Conversely, fatty acids can reduce sensitivity to the sourness of organic acids and bitterness of some tastants (Mattes, 2007) , possibly improving mouthfeel.",

            "text": "When comparing the sapid profiles of food and wine, there appears to be little similarity. In contrast, there is extensive incongruity. Wine possesses gusta tory attributes predominantly characterized as sour, bitter, astringent, and burning. In contrast, solid foods are variously distinguished by sweet, salty, savory (glu tamate), and sebaceous (fatty acids) sensations. Sour, bitter, astringent, and spicy hot attributes are (or have been) less common in Western cooking, and then usu ally in condiments. The inherent, aversive reactions to such sensations probably arose during evolution, to avoid or limit the consumption of potentially toxic and rotten foods. Conversely, these compounds were prob ably selected during plant evolution to discourage their consumption, with the predominate exception being ripe fruit. During domestication, crop variants were selected with reduced aversive and enhanced pleasant tasting constituents. Thus, lettuce and other vegetables became less bitter; apples, cherries, and other fruits sweeter and less sour or astringent; citrus fruit less acidic; and legumes less flatulent. Cooking further facil itated these actions by inactivating or facilitating the removal of potential food toxins and antimetabolites. Examples include mycotoxins in fungi, alkaloids in potatoes, and cyanogenic glycosides in casava. Cooking meat also facilitates digestion (collagen and protein fiber breakdown) and enhances flavor. Disappointingly, some cooking processes generate their own toxins, notably roasting and searing. Examples are acrylamide (a Maillard byproduct), and a variety of toxic, pyrolytic, smoke byproducts. Fermentation is another ancient technique that helped destroy antimetabolites. For example, Rhizopus oligosporus, used in the production of tempeh, degrades the compounds that induce flatu lence in soybeans. Lactobacillus can also destroy soy saponins. Fermentation also has the potential to break down difficulttodigest oligosaccharides, and help pre serve perishable foodstuffs.",

It offers both gustatory, olfactory, and trigeminal receptors time to reestablish their native receptive state, countering adap tation and loss of sensory appeal. Thus, food apprecia tion is enhanced by being sampled afresh. Wine can, unromantically, be viewed as a savory mouthwash. In addition, volatility of food and wine flavorants is influ enced by the dynamically changing concentrations of ethanol, phenols, carbohydrates, etc. supplied with the wine. Conversely, food dilutes, masks, and eliminates most wine flavors. The result being that the next sam ple can be appreciated to its full, adaptation having been avoided.",

It is not lack of flavor subtlety that denies these expe riences from the great unwashed. Admittedly, as noted in Chapter 11, there is an incredible range in human sensory sensitivity, with those having higher than aver age acuity tending to prefer milder favored foods, and those with below average acuity tending to prefer more intensely flavored foods. But, these are no more than tendencies, with experience and social pressures capa ble of inducing significant shifts in preference, if not perception. Psychological influences and a desire to be influenced can distort perception, creating impressions that are 'real,' only because of the conditions under which the experience occurred. The more unexpected and astounding the sensation, the stronger the memory trace created. The more the mind is studied, the more we come to realize how the brain can distort percep tion. Experience generates mental models of reality, against which our sensations of reality are judged, interpreted, and potentially modified. Thus, it is wise to doubt perceptions and attempt to separate experience based memory patterns from actuality, unless it is a selective choice to allow the mind to deceive us.",

Time has only augmented our understanding of the multifaceted nature of this Dr Jekyll-Mr Hyde phenomenon.

Abusive ethanol consumption can cause cirrho sis of the liver, increase the likelihood of hypertension and stroke, favor the development of breast and diges tive tract cancers, and induce fetal alcohol syndrome. Many of these effects may stem from the activation of freeradical damage induced by high alcohol intake (Meagher et al., 1999) . Others may arise indirectly, via the accumulation of acetaldehyde, a major break down product of ethanol metabolism (Lachenmeier et al., 2009) .

Ancient Greek and Roman society used wine extensively as a solvent for herbal infusions. This practice continued largely unabated until the begin ning of the twentieth century. The excessive abuse of distilled alcoholic beverages, combined with religious and political conservatism, created a backlash against all beverages containing alcohol, notably in North America. Alcohol was viewed as an agent of corruption to be annihilated. Following the failure of Prohibition, humans themselves, not alcohol, came to be viewed as the source of iniquity. Alcoholism is now appropriately viewed as a developmental, multistage, chronic depend ence, possessing a complex etiology (Nurnberger and Bierut, 2007) , with both genetic and environmental aspects. In this regard, it is similar to other addictions (Ersche et al., 2012) . Thus, the social climate is chang ing, and the relationship between wine (as opposed to alcohol) and health is again being reassessed, and finally investigated seriously.",

Of the seven known ADH genes (Crabb et al., 2004) , three function in the liver. The others act in the gastric epithelium and other tissues. Subsequent oxi dation converts acetaldehyde to acetic acid. This occurs principally under the action of mitochondrial acetalde hyde dehydrogenase (ALDH2).

Some of the isozymes possess distinct physiological attributes. For example, ADH1B*1 codes for an isozyme subu nit that oxidizes ethanol slowly, whereas ADH1B*2 encodes for a highly active subunit of the dimeric enzyme (about 30 times more efficient) (Thomasson et al., 1995) . Correspondingly, those individuals who are homo or heterozygous for the ADH1B*2 subu nit, eliminate alcohol from their blood more rapidly. Rapid alcohol oxidation may donate a degree of pro tection against alcoholism, by quickly converting etha nol to acetaldehyde. Such individuals tend to consume less alcohol and show more rapid and marked negative consequences to alcohol consumption (headaches and hangovers) than do those metabolizing alcohol more slowly (Wall et al., 2005) . This 'protection' is appar ently enhanced when combined with slowacting alleles for acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH2) (Crabb et al., 2004) . Although viewed as a beneficial trait, rapid alcohol degradation probably reduces some of the health benefits of ethanol consumption. Slow acet aldehyde metabolism also appears to predispose indi viduals for cancers of the oropharynx and esophagus.",

At low rates of alcohol intake, acetaldehyde metabolism is suf ficiently rapid to limit its accumulation and liberation from the liver. At higher concentrations, acetaldehyde production rapidly consumes the liver's glutathione reserves -a central cellular antioxidant. This coincides with activation of the microsomal ethanol oxidation pathway that generates toxic freeoxygen radicals. In the absence of sufficient glutathione, freeoxygen radi cals can accumulate, disrupting mitochondrial func tion. Elsewhere in the body, acetaldehyde can bind with proteins and cellular constituents, forming stable complexes (Niemela and Parkkila, 2004) . These can lead to the production of immunogenic determinants, which can stimulate antibody production against acet aldehyde adducts. This may induce some of the chronic tissue damage associated with alcohol abuse (Niemela and Israel, 1992) . The binding of acetaldehyde to the plasma membrane of red blood cells is known to increase rigidity. By limiting their ability to squeeze through the narrowest capillaries, oxygen supply to tissue cells may be restricted. This could participate in suppressed brain function. It is estimated that the brain consumes up to 20% of the blood's oxygen supply, but constitutes only about 2.5% of body mass.",

For example, tannins and phenolic acids can interfere with the action of certain digestive enzymes, notably \u03b1amylase, lipase and trypsin (Rohn et al., 2002; Gu et al., 2011) . Digestion may be further slowed by phe nolics polymerizing with food proteins. These effects may be mollified by the presence of ionic carbohydrates commonly found in food (Gon\u00e7alves et al., 2011) , as well as by salivary proteins. Both monomers and proanthocyanidins bind with basic, prolinerich, and histatin proteins in the saliva. Their bonding is revers ible, depending on equilibrium conditions. They can become irreversible, though, in the presence of metal ions, upon oxidation, or with pH changes (Luck et al., 1994) . Normally, these insoluble saliva/tannin com plexes remain stable in the stomach and upper alimen tary tract (Lu and Bennick, 1998) . Thus, the potential of tannins to inactivate digestive enzymes or disrupt mineral uptake can be reduced. Degradation of these complexes, and their moieties, subsequently occurs in the colon. In contrast, pepsinactivated protein break down is activated by monomeric phenolics, such as quercetin, resveratrol, catechin, and epigallocatechin gallate (Tagliazucchi et al., 2005) . Clearly the issue is complex and much more needs to be known. Not only are the effects potentially different in the stomach and small and large intestines, but, also, phenolic chemistry changes during passage through the digestive tract.",

This proportion increases when jointly consumed with food, but it is spread over a much longer period. This results primarily by food retarding gastric emptying. Consequently, alcohol transfer into the intestines is delayed. This gives the liver more time to metabolize the ethanol being absorbed, lowering the maximal blood alcohol levels reached. However, taking sparkling wine on an empty stomach increases shortterm alcohol uptake by about 35% (Ridout et al., 2003) . Because the same wine, with its carbon diox ide removed, did not have the same influence, it is sus pected that carbon dioxide was the active ingredient. It has occasionally been proposed that carbon dioxide relaxes the pyloric sphincter, allowing earlier transfer of fluids from the stomach into the duodenum, and thereby its absorption into the blood.",

This significantly limits their uptake in the stomach and small intestine. Passage through the stomach does not modify the majority of wine phenolics. Amongst flavonoids, anthocyanins appear to be those that most quickly traverse the stomach and pass into the blood (Passamonti et al., 2003) . They are also effectively translocated across the wall of the small intestine (Talav\u00e9ra et al., 2005) . Phenolic acids, such as caffeic acid (Simonetti et al., 2001) , and resveratrol (Soleas et al., 2001) also readily pass into the plasma via the intestinal tract. In contrast, flavonoid polymers tend to remain in the intestine, until degraded to phenolic acids and aldehydes by bacteria in the colon (large intestine) (Aura, 2008; Fig. 12.3) . Also metabolized in the colon are any anthocyanins or catechins monomers that have not already been absorbed and/or microbi ally degraded. For example, gallotannins are microbi ally converted to urolithins (Truchado et al., 2012b) . Although these byproducts have little antioxidant action, they do have anticancer effects and can have beneficial effects on intestinal inflammatory disease (Gim\u00e9nezBastida et al., 2012) .

Hydroxycinnamic acids are also rapidly absorbed and metabolized into glucuronide and sulfate conjugates (Nardini et al., 2009 ). This both reduces their toxicity (potential carcinogenicity) as well as facilitates their excretion by the kidneys. However, the latter reduces their potential beneficial effects.

Nevertheless, alcohol is not par ticularly antimicrobial, certainly at the concentrations found in wine (its sterilant action is optimal at about 70%). Thus, the antibiotic action of wine results pri marily from other constituents, probably its phenolic content. Modification of anthocyanins during fermen tation increases their toxicity to viruses, protozoans, and bacteria. Other phenolic compounds, typical of red wines, are also bacteriostatic and fungistatic. For example, pcoumaric acid is particularly active against grampositive bacteria, such as Staphylococcus and Streptococcus; whereas other phenols inhibit Gram negative bacteria, such as Escherichia, Shigella, Proteus, and Vibrio (Masquelier, 1988) . The latter cause serious forms of diarrhea and dysentery. Phenolics may also be inhibitory to intestinal pathogens such as Clostridium difficile, C. perfringens, and Bacteroides (Lee et al., 2006) . Despite wine being more effective than mildly antimicrobial agents, such as bismuth salicylate (Weisse et al., 1995) , full action may take several hours (M\u00f8retr\u00f8 and Daeschel, 2004; Dolara et al., 2005) . An indirect effect, limiting intestinal problems (and improving digestion), may be illustrated by the action of the colon flora on anthocyanin structure. It favors the growth of Bifidobacterium spp. and Lactobacillus-Enterococcus spp. (Hidalgo et al., 2012) . These have been associated with a healthy gut microflora (Hord, 2008) . There is also considerable variation in the effects of different flavanols and procyanidins, both promoting and inhibiting the adhesion of probiotic lactobacilli to the intestinal wall, depending on their metabolic modification during passage through the intestinal tract (Bustos et al., 2012) .",

Alternative methods of action may involve suppression of cell adherence and colony formation on the gut lining (Selma et al., 2012; Truchado et al., 2012a) . Adherence is often a pre requisite for the cascade of events leading to disease development. Low pH and the presence of various organic acids appear to accentuate the antimicrobial action of both wine phenolics and ethanol.

Alcohol consumption is also correlated with a decrease in the likelihood of intermittent claudication (pain or cramping in the calf of the leg). Claudication is a common indicator of peripheral arterial disease. Recent studies have con firmed that incidental factors, such as gender, race, life style, educational level, etc. do not affect these results (see Mukamal et al., 2006) . Studies have also demon strated that daily consumption of alcohol significantly reduces the incidence of other forms of cardiovascular disease, such as hypertension (Keil et al., 1998) , heart attack (Gaziano et al., 1999) , stroke (Truelsen et al., 1998; Hillbom, 1999) , and peripheral arterial disease (Camargo et al., 1997) . Those who consume wine moderately live, on average, 2.5-3.5 years longer than teetotalers, and considerably longer than heavy drink ers. The prime area of contention is the degree to which these benefits accrue from the effects of ethanol vs. phenolic and/or other constituents (Rimm et al., 1996) . Atherosclerosis is the principal cause of most car diovascular disease (Libby, 2001) . It apparently results from chronic injury to the arteries (Fig. 12.5 ). Although associated with several independent factors, most damage appears to be a consequence of lipid oxidation -in a special subgroup of cholesterol apoproteins complexes, the lowdensity lipoproteins (LDLs). Because of the hydrophobic nature of cho lesterol and triglycerides, their transfer in the plasma requires a special transport vehicle. As illustrated in Fig. 12 .6, lipoprotein complexes consist of an outer membrane of phospholipids, in which apoproteins and free cholesterol occur. They enclose a hydrophobic core possessing numerous triglycerides and cholesteryl esters. The specific apoproteins in the complex regulate the metabolism of the associated lipids.",

            "text": "Normally, LDLs function in supplying cholesterol for cellular membrane repair and the synthesis of ster oids. However, in high concentrations, they may accu mulate in the artery wall. If they remain there for an extended period, their lipid content tends to become oxidized. In an oxidized state, lipids are cytotoxic and indirectly irritate the artery wall. As a consequence, special adhesion proteins attach to the artery wall. Monocytes and helper Tcells of the immune system bond to these proteins. In addition, affected endothe lial cells may secrete compounds, such as endothelin1. Endothelin1 activates the migration of monocytes and Tcells into the artery wall. Procyanidins, princi pally found in red wines, are particularly effective in suppressing the production of endothelin1 (Corder et al., 2001) . In the layer just underneath the endothe lial lining (intima), accumulated monocytes mature into macrophages. Both macrophages and Tcells may release a range of cytokines that further activate the immune system, involving localized inflammation. Activated macrophages tend to engulf oxidized LDLs. However, as the LDLs are not degraded, their progres sive accumulation gives the macrophage the appear ance of being full of bubbles. This has given rise to the term foam cells. They are the first clear evidence of the beginning of localized arterial swelling (plaques). Occasionally plaques bulge into the vessel. More fre quently, they initially enlarge outward into the sur rounding tissue. Action of immune cells in the plaque also induces migration of smooth muscle cells from the artery wall into the intima. Here they proliferate and produce collagen, forming a fibrous cap over the plaque. Additional LDLs slowly collect, provoking fur ther rounds of inflammation and plaque enlargement. These accretions may develop their own vasculature, becoming fibrous and inelastic. As the plaques enlarge, they may produce irregular protrusions into and block the artery lumen. Even without restricting blood flow, plaques set the stage for platelet aggregation, clot formation (throm bus) and the blockage that can precipitate a heart attack or stroke. In the later phases of plaque forma tion, unknown factors enhance inflammatory changes in the plaque. These disrupt the integrity of the cap. For example, collagenases secreted by macrophages inhibit collagen synthesis by smooth muscle cells. Sudden rupture of a plaque permits blood infiltra tion into the plaque. Because plaques contain potent blood clotting factors, thrombus development is almost instantaneous. It is currently thought that plaque rup ture is the principal factor inducting thrombus forma tion, and precipitating a heart attack, stroke, or other cardiovascular trauma.",

Part of the reversal process involves the action of highdensity lipoproteins (HDLs). Of the two principal forms, ethanol augments the presence of HDL 3 , whereas exercise increases the level of HDL 2 . The effect of ethanol on HDL concentration appears to be independent of beverage type (van der Gaag et al., 2001) . Either form of HDL favors the removal of cho lesterol from the arteries, transferring it to the liver for metabolism. HDLs also appear to interfere with LDL oxidation. Because the HDL/LDL ratio affects the degree and rate of cholesterol turnover, the slower the rate, the greater the likelihood of oxidation (Walzem et al., 1995) and eventual plaque formation.",

In a recent in vitro study, though, monomeric or lowmolecularweight fla vonoids and hydroxycinnamic acids enhanced platelet aggregation and LDL oxidation, with only large polymers being inhibitory (Shanmuganayagam et al., 2012) . In another investigation, the combined effect of several Figure 12 .7 Inactivation of platelet aggregation induced by sev eral red wine fractions (barrel or bottleaged, their dealcoholized versions, total ethanol extracts (EtOAc) and ethanol extracts at pHs 7 and 2, and anthocyanin extracts from the wines. (From Baldi et al., 1997, reproduced by permission.) phenolics was superior to single compounds (Wallerath et al., 2005) . The action partially results from the enhanced synthesis and release of nitric oxide by endothe lial cells. This has been found to occur at resveratrol con centrations associated with moderate wine consumption (Gresele et al., 2008) . Chlorogenic acid also appears to activate nitric oxide production (Mubarak et al., 2012) . Nitric oxide induces vasodilation (by relaxing vascular smooth muscle), reduces blood pressure, and limits plate let adhesion to blood vessel endothelia. Indicative of the complexities of such interactions is the observation that flavonoids may also inactivate nitric oxide (Verhagen et al., 1997) . In addition, nitric oxide, notably as perox ynitrile, oxidizes LDLs. Clearly, much more still needs to be known before a clear picture emerges. Supplemental to the effects on platelet aggregation, phenolic wine constituents can bind directly with LDLs (limiting their oxidation); indirectly reduce their mac rophagemediated oxidation; and preserve the action of paraoxonase (further protecting LDLs from oxida tion) (Aviram and Fuhrman, 2002) . Furthermore, red wine phenolics directly or indirectly limit the migra tion of smooth muscle cells into the intima of artery walls. These influences probably explain some of the added benefits of wine versus other alcoholic bever ages in reducing the incidence and severity of cardio vascular disease. Although flavonoids tend to suppress inflammation, conflicting observations put the clinical significance of their antiinflammatory action to ather osclerosis in question.",

It has greater antioxidant action than common dietary antioxidants, such as vita min E and ascorbic acid (Frankel et al., 1993) . There is also direct evidence that resveratrol can enter the blood system at levels sufficient to suppress cyclooxygenase (COX) and 5lipoxygenase pathways. These are involved in the synthesis of proinflammatory mediators (Bertelli, 1998) . In addition, resveratrol can activate proteins involved in nerve cell differentiation, synaptic plasticity, and neuronal survival (Tredici et al., 1999) .

This side effect may be counteracted by the mildly acidic, dilute alcohol content of table wines. Other beneficial effects connected with moderate wine consumption may accrue from its mildly diuretic and muscle relaxant properties. The diuretic action of wine can help reduce water retention and minimize joint swelling. Wine can also directly reduce muscle spasms and the stiffness associated with arthritis. The antiinflammatory influ ences of wine phenolics, notably resveratrol (Elmali et al., 2007) , may also play a role in diminishing the suffering associated with arthritis.",

This may result from wine phe nolics quenching oxygen radicals, thought to be piv otal in the damage associated with type 2 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes appears to result when body cells fail to respond properly to the presence of insulin. The incidence of metabolic syndrome is also lower in wine drinkers (Rosell et al., 2003) . These effects may be due to one or more of the following: the influences of alcohol on metabolism; the antidiabetic properties of the element vanadium (for which wine is a significant source) (Brichard and Henquin, 1995; Teiss\u00e8dre et al., 1996) ; the hypoglycemic and hypolipidemic effects of phenolics such as resveratrol (Su et al., 2006) ; or through some effect on endothelial nitric oxidase syn thase (Leighton et al., 2006) . It appears there may be considerable specificity. For example, in a comparison between malvidin and delphinidin3Oglucosides, only the predominant anthocyanin in grapes (malvidin) seems to have a significant hypoglycemic effect (Lida et al., 2012) .",

At the concentrations typically found in table wine, though, ethanol diminishes the carcinogenicity of ethyl carbamate. Certain wine phenolics can be protective, whereas others mutagenic, especially at high concentra tions. For example, quercetin can induce mutations in laboratory tissue cultures, but is a potent anticarcino gen in wholeanimal studies (Fazal et al., 1990 ). This apparent anomaly may result from differences in the concentrations of quercetin used, and/or the low levels of metal ions and free oxygen found in the body (vs. tissue culture). In addition, quercetin, along with sev eral other phenolics that are potential carcinogens, lose this attribute when present as a glycoside. Most pheno lics in the plasma occur in some conjugated state, not as free phenolics. In addition, phenolics may detoxify the small quantities of nitrites commonly found in food. However, in the presence of high nitrite concen trations (a preservative found in smoked and pick led foods), nitrites are converted into diazophenols (Weisburger, 1991) . These appear to favor the develop ment of oral and stomach cancers.",

Figure  12 .8 illustrates the range of sulfur dioxide contents potentially found in Californian wine. A small propor tion of winesensitive asthmatics may experience bron chial constriction on exposure to sulfite (Dahl et al., 1986) . In a study by Vally and Thompson (2001) , wine containing 300 ppm sulfite induced a rapid drop in forced expiratory volume, reaching a maximal decline within about 5 min. Recovery took between 15 and 60 min. The same individuals did not respond to wine containing 20, 75, or 150 ppm sulfite. Why sensitive asthmatics episodically react to wines with low S0 2 contents may be related to changes in the state of their asthma control. Surprisingly, red wines appear to pro voke more asthma problems than white wines, even though red wines typically have lower sulfur dioxide contents than white wines.",

ALDH2 is the principal enzyme oxidizing acetaldehyde to acetic acid. It is esti mated that up to 50% of eastern Asians express this allergiclike reaction on alcohol consumption. It has been suggested that the ALDH2 mutant, frequently found in eastern Asians, may reflect an evolution ary selective adaptation to the endemic occurrence of hepatitis B in the region (Lin and Cheng, 2002) . The resulting avoidance of alcohol would avert any syn ergism between alcohol and hepatitis Binduced liver damage. A malfunctional alcohol dehydrogenase allele (ADH2) is also suspected to play a contributing role in flushing reactions (Eriksson et al., 2001) .",

The phenomenon tends to be suppressed by acetylsali cylic acid (aspirin), if taken before an alcohol challenge (Truitt et al., 1987) .

Nonetheless, wine could provoke increased sensitivity. This may explain the benefit of antihistamines in diminishing the rhinitis occasionally associated with wine consumption (Andersson et al., 2003) . In addition, antihistamines counteract the broncho constriction in individuals showing histamine intolerance. Histamine intolerance presumably relates to reduced activity of diamine oxidase . Idiopathic allergic and other immune hypersensitive responses to wine are difficult to predict or diagnose. Reactions may include the induction of headaches, nausea, vomiting, general malaise, or a combination of these. In a few instances, IgErelated anaphylaxis reac tions have been reported to grape PR proteins (endo chitinase and thaumatin) (Pastorello et al., 2003) . The effects may involve urticaria/angioedema (red patches or wheals on the skin/swelling), and occasionally shock. Residual amounts of fining agents, such as egg whites, have also been implicated in some allergic reac tions (Marinkovich, 1982) . In a doubleblind, placebo controlled trial, wines fined with egg white, isinglass, or nongrape derived tannins presented 'an extremely low risk of anaphylaxis' to egg, fish, or peanutallergic consumers (Rolland et al., 2006) . In an ELISA study, only egg white and lysozyme could be detected in wine samples (Weber et al., 2007) .

Migraines appear to be induced by a wide range of environmental stimuli, possibly because migraines themselves have a complex etiology. The dilation of cerebral blood vessels, partially as a result of histamine release, appears to be a common element in many headache syndromes. Migraines may be one of them, although current thought suggests a neurologi cal rather than a vascular origin. When red vs. white wines were discovered to contain higher concentrations of biogenic amines, such as histamine and tyramine, there was the initial assumption that they were the cul prits. However, it was later realized that the normal levels of histamine in red wines are below those that generally trigger a migraine. In addition, doubleblind studies have seemingly exonerated histamine in most redwineinduced migraine headaches (Masyczek and Ough, 1983) . Nevertheless, alcohol can suppress the action of diamine oxidase, an important enzyme in the small intestine that inactivates histamine, and other biogenic amines . Thus, in individuals with histamine intolerance, sufficient hista mine may enter the blood system to provoke a vascular headache or unrelated allergylike symptoms. However, this view does not correlate with the observation that spirits and sparkling wine are more frequently associ ated with migraine attacks than table wines (white or red) or beer (Nicolodi and Sicuteri, 1999) . Both spir its and sparkling wines are low in histamine content. However, both are more likely to be taken alone, pos sibly on an empty stomach, leading to more rapid and higher spikes in blood alcohol content.",

            "text": "Although the biogenic amine content of wine appears to be insufficient to cause migraines in most individuals, the phenolic content of wine might explain why red wines are more frequently associated with a variety of headache sequelae than white wines. On average, red wines contain about 1200 mg/liter phe nolics, vs. 200 mg/liter for white wines. Some, but not all, phenolics suppress the action of platelet phenolsul fotransferase (PST) (Jones et al., 1995; Yeh and Yen, 2003) . It is an important detoxifier of phenolics and amines. Distinct isozymic versions, PSTM and PSTP, preferentially catalyze the sulfation (detoxification) of various endogenous and xenobiotic biogenic amines and phenolics. Individuals having low levels of plate letbound PSTP are apparently more susceptible to migraine headaches (Alam et al., 1997) . Small phenolic compounds can prolong the action of potent hormones and nerve transmitters, such as histamine, serotonin, dopamine, adrenalin, and noradrenaline. Biogenic amines activate the liberation of 5hydroxytryptamine (5HT, serotonin), an important brain neurotransmitter. It also promotes platelet aggregation and blood vessel dilation. An increase in intercranial pressure may be involved in the perception of pain in a migraine attack (Pattichis et al., 1995) . Nonetheless, most research suggests alternate associations between histamine and migraines. People prone to migraine headaches may also show abnormal and cyclical patterns in platelet sensitivity to 5HT release (Jones et al., 1982; Peatfield et al., 1995) . This may explain why wine consumption is not consistently linked to migraine induction.",

The headache seems related to the release of type E pros taglandins, important chemicals involved in dilating blood vessels. If this association is correct, the inhibi tion of prostaglandin synthesis by acetylsalicylic acid, acetaminophen, or ibuprofen could explain why they can prevent headache development, when taken prior to wine consumption (Kaufman, 1992) .",

Contraction of the membranes covering the brain (the meninges) could pull on fibers attaching the outer most layer (dura mater) to the skull, causing pain sensors to discharge. Alternatively, the diuretic effect of ethanol could result in electrolytic imbalance. The resultant disruption of normal nerve and muscle function could theoretically induce symptoms such as headache, nausea, and fatigue. Ethanol can also induce the breakdown of glycogen in the liver. The resulting influx of glucose, on being eliminated in the urine, could produce hypoglyce mia and a feeling of weakness.

Removal of calcium softens the enamel, which becomes susceptible to erosion by masticatory forces and tooth brushing. Demineralization commences at about pH 5.7. Dental erosion is not a problem for the typical consumer, who takes wine with meals. Food and saliva secretion limit, if not prevent, demineralization of tooth enamel. However, after many years, professional wine tasters may experience tooth disfiguration, affecting both tooth shape and size. Cupping, a depression in the enamel, exposing dentine at the tip of molar cusps, is a frequent clinical sign. Erosion can also contribute to severe root abrasion at the gum line. Protection is partially achieved by rinsing the mouth with an alka line mouthwash after tasting, application of a fluoride gel (such as APF), and refraining from tooth brushing for at least one hour after tasting. The delay permits minerals in the saliva to rebind with enamel. For more protective protocols see Ranjitkar et al. (2012) .",

It was first described in 1973, and appeared most markedly in the children of alcoholic mothers. They tended also to be heavy smokers, users of illicit drugs, consumers of large amounts of coffee, had poor nutrition, or showed a combination of these (see Scholten, 1982; Whitten, 1996) . It is suspected that alcohol is the principal cause, although the concentra tion and timing associated with FAS are still uncertain. Acetaldehyde accumulation may also be involved, as well as other environmental factors.",
