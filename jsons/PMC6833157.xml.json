Although the molecular mechanisms are not fully elucidated yet, the reported immune dysfunction of the cells from septic patients during immune-depression concern both the innate and adaptive immunity [2]. This phenotype is also observed in many other acute injuries suggesting a common pathophysiology after significant stress conditions as trauma [3], cardiopulmonary resuscitation [4], and major surgery [5]. However, if immunodepression is profound and persistent the patients become at risk of secondary infections [6] or are unable to resolve the primary infection [7].",

Until now, there are few adequate \u201cimmunoscope\u201d candidates that are feasible in daily clinical practice and may facilitate the decision-making process. The quantification of the expression of the MHC class II molecule HLA-DR on circulating monocytes appears to represent a suitable parameter [8\u201311]. A persistent low level of HLA-DR expression is associated with the development of secondary infections and impaired clinical outcome [6, 12]. Of importance, it is becoming increasingly clear that the attenuated immune response can be reversed by different pharmacological interventions, including GM-CSF [13], IL-7 [14], anti-PD [15] and IFN\u03b3 [16]. Nowadays, as a last resort treatment, immunostimulating treatment is sometimes applied in critically ill sepsis patients and several small case series have been published [16]. Although effects on clinically relevant end-points can only be determined in randomized clinical trials, relevant data related to immunological properties, safety, and timing of treatment are needed to facilitate the design of such trials.",

The decision to administer IFN\u03b3 was made on the following criteria, which were not modified between 2004 and 2017: (1) an ICU stay over 7 days; (2) a diagnosis of secondary infection/colonization or an uncontrolled initial infection despite adequate antimicrobial therapy and/or interventional procedures; (3) a stable (at least 2 measurements) low level of mHLA-DR expression (<8000 antibody bound/cell (AB/C in our laboratory). Before IFN\u03b3 treatment (100mcg per subcutaneous injection, repeated at least 3 days with a maximum duration of 5 days) a written informed consent was obtained for each individual or from closest relative. The clear explanation of the potential risks and benefits to administer the drug as a compassionate treatment was applied according to the French Ethical law. For some patients, pro- and anti-inflammatory plasma cytokines levels were measured before and just after the end of IFN\u03b3 treatment.

Case 1: a 7 y/o transplanted the 1st time at the first year for fulminant hepatitis had to be transplanted again for chronic humoral rejection despite full treatment. She was referred for end-stage liver failure motivating an emergency liver transplantation 1 month after admission outlined by a hemorrhagic shock. After transplantation, continuous veno-venous hemodiafiltration was used for anuric renal failure and massive fluid overload. Under post-operative immunosuppression (basiliximab on day 1 and 4, methylprednisolone, tacrolimus and mycophenolate mofetil) an invasive aspergillosis (Aspergillus fumigatus) was confirmed in BAL, lumbar puncture and blood PCR with serial galactomannan antigenemia and blood PCR. Antifungal therapy associating voriconazole and caspofungine were initiated and immunosuppression stopped. The child developed an acute and reversible hemorrhagic event related to multifocal intracerebral Aspergillosis lesions, and severe ARDS. In regard to the severity of the infection, rescue IFN\u03b3 was considered and proposed as a compassionate treatment. After parent\u2019s agreement and despite the modest reduction in mHLA-DR expression (mHLA-DR: 15,000 AB/C), one dose of 100 micrograms of IFN\u03b3 was subcutaneously injected. Although the improvement of the child condition (resolution of the respiratory failure and clinical awakening allowing to extubate), the child died on day 18 after transplantation with uncontrolled hemorrhage. Case 2: a 22-month-old boy originally transplanted for biliary atresia, was admitted to be transplanted again for recurrent cholangitis secondary to post-transplantation hepatic artery thrombosis and ischemic cholangitis.. The postoperative complications were: a renal tubulopathy; a delayed awaking and a suspicion of ventilatory associated pneumonia. He was rapidly re-intubated because of developed ARDS, associated with anuria, and septic shock with severe hypoxemia despite the use of all techniques to improve oxygenation. Distal lung protected sampling (> 107 cfu/ml) and ascites were positive for highly resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Maximal supportive therapy associated with iv and aerosolized colistin with potential acquisition of resistance motivated discussion about IFN\u03b3 treatment. Monocytic HLA-DR measures were repetitively low (Day 11: mHLA-DR 2773 AB/C) (Fig. 2), 20 micrograms of IFN\u03b3 were injected subcutaneously during three consecutive days, with no significant side effect. The child dramatically improved hemodynamically at day 1 after the first IFN\u03b3 injection and was extubated 2 days later. Repetitive blood cultures and lung and abdominal samples remained negative. The child remains well thereafter. Both patients\u2019 immune monitoring of HLA-DR was monitored by the center A with the same protocol than cohort 1, using the same set up of flowcytometer.",

This immune-suppression is associated with reactivation of latent viral infections [20], the development of secondary infections and impaired clinical outcomes [6, 21]. Several pharmacological interventions may restore the immune response, but adequately large clinical trials are currently lacking. We investigated the safety and immunological effects of IFN\u03b3 in 17 adult patients reported that IFN\u03b3 increased monocytic HLA-DR expression in all except one patient. Treatment with IFN\u03b3 did not boost circulating cytokine concentrations: IL-6 and IL-10 concentrations were lower than pretreatment values. It tended to decrease NK-cell proportion without changes for other leukocyte subpopulations. In addition, cultures that remained positive prior to IFN\u03b3 treatment became negative in all patients. No safety effects judged to be attributable to IFN\u03b3 were observed. Overall, survival appeared higher than anticipated in this specific group of immunoparalyzed patients, but clearly the numbers are too small to conclude that the restoration of the immune response is related to better clinical outcome.",

This molecule received the FDA approval for clinical application against chronic granulomatous disease to decrease the severity and number of infections. Beneficial effects of adjuvant treatment using IFN\u03b3 for fungal infections in patients suffering from chronic granulomatous disease [17] HIV [23\u201325], leukemia [26, 27], and in organ transplant patients [28] were previously reported. The first report using this IFN\u03b3 in human bacterial sepsis was made by Docke et al. [9] in 9 septic ICU patients at 100mcg daily dose. Since then, several small case series suffering from opportunistic infections [16] [29] or pediatric case [30, 31] or HIV cases [23\u201325] have been published. The present case series is the first reporting the use of IFN\u03b3 in adult and pediatric bacterial sepsis, including septic shock patients with associated cytokines level modifications and immunophenotyping. The delay to use IFN\u03b3 from the ICU hospitalization differed largely within the 2 reported small cohorts. One might argue that the unfavorable outcome in 2 patients of cohort 2 early treated may suggest that IFN\u03b3 therapy should not be used too early, even when HLA-DR expression is already suppressed. In the early treated group, the patients are still in the steep part of the survival curve with a high mortality (close to 50%) of severe septic shock patients [32]. Nevertheless, the cases of the cohort 2 early treated (< 4 days after admission for septic shock) had a rapid downregulation of HLA-DR expression that responded well to IFN\u03b3 stimulation for mHLA-DR expression. The lack of positive signal for outcome could be related to a downregulation adapted to the acute phase with no benefit to administer IFN\u03b3.",

This aspect should be verified in a larger population. As reported previously, the IFN\u03b3 treatment was well tolerated in our 20 patients with no clearly attributable severe side effects.
