Due to the presence of effective antivirals against different types of influenza viruses, rapid laboratory diagnosis may result in less antibiotic prescription and more frequent use of those antivirals. The introduction of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques has improved the detection of respiratory viruses, particularly with the use of multiplex real-time techniques with the capability of simultaneous detection of various pathogens in a single reaction. Currently, this new method has been successfully applied to the routine diagnosis and epidemiological detection of respiratory infections including influenza in many centers with reasonable specificity and sensitivity.7-9 On the other hand, current diagnostic methods for respiratory illnesses have some deficiencies in Iran. Due to inexpensive and low,cost of antibiotic values across the country, physicians are unwilling about application of new diagnostics tools including molecularbased techniques. This may result in a prolonged stay of patients in hospital as well as in increased morbidity, possibly associated with inappropriate therapy. The aims of this study were to apply the above technology for the diagnosis of influenza infections and at the same time to differentiate between common flu types among hospitalized patients in Laleh hospital.",

This kit could differentiate between the pandemic influenza A (H1N1)pdm strain and other (untyped) influenza A strains; the results were classified as and flu A (H1N1) if a sample was positive for to both influenza A and H1, and flu A if a sample was positive to influenza A and negative to H1. If a positive laboratory test result was not compatible with the clinical picture of the patients, the assay was repeated by another technician on the same sample.

Identification of flu A subtypes different from H1 was not possible with this panel. Finding of different flu species, subtypes and variants would be useful for epidemiological investigations and for tracking outbreaks and also predict flu vaccine efficiency. Moreover, other flulike illnesses such as respiratory syncytial virus and human metapeumovirus infections were missed from differential diagnosis in patients who were flu-negative. Moreover, coinfections between these viruses were also ignored. These latter issues are due to the absence of more comprehensive diagnostic tools for respiratory viral infection evaluation at least in our center. In conclusion, despite no other respiratory pathogen were investigated, these results showed that almost 40% of patients admitted to Laleh hospital were infected by influenza virus. Influenza diagnosis was not achieved in up to 60% of flu-like respiratory infections, suggesting the potential benefit of adopting the same methodology for assessing the involvement of other viral or/and bacterial pathogens in those patients. This study clearly revealed that the rapid diagnosis due to the application of a multiplex molecular test would result in a shorter period of hospitalization and would benefit patients avoiding unnecessary antibiotic therapy due to the exclusion of bacterial infections.",
