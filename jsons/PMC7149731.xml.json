During acute illness, and for about 1 to 2 weeks after recovery, massive amounts of parvovirus (over 1 billion virions per gram of feces) are shed in the feces of infected dogs. Because the virus can survive and remain infectious for 5 to 7 months in the environment, fomites and environmental contamination play a major role in transmission. A peak seasonal incidence in the months of July, August, and September was found in a Canadian study, but this may vary by climatologic region.",
