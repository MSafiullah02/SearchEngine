Over the last five decades, airflow patterns in urban areas at different scales have been widely studied by wind engineers and meteorologists. Concerns on the negative effects of urbanization on the environment recently make the topic increasingly important for urban planners and architects (Ng, 2009, Bottema, 1995). Tall and compact building blocks seriously worsens the natural ventilation performance at the metropolitan areas, even though there is a large wind potential in the urban atmosphere boundary layer, such as Hong Kong which is a high-density coastal city. The natural ventilation is an important contributing factor to outdoor thermal comfort, especially in subtropical cities. Cheng et al. (2012) indicated that, taking the Physiologically Equivalent Temperature (PET) thermal comfort as a standard, wind speed decreasing from 1.0 to 0.3 m/s is equal to 1.9 \u00b0C air temperature increase in the subtropical summer. Good planning and design which include the wind knowledge can mitigate negative effects of urbanization, particularly urban heat island intensity (Oke, 1987). Furthermore, these planning and design make compact urban living environments more comfortable for residents and consequently aid in the restriction of uncontrolled urban spreading (European Environment Agency, 2006, Garreau, 1992).",

To mitigate the undesirable effects of the proposed buildings on the surrounding natural ventilation performance, four steps for knowledge-based decision making are significantly important in the design process. The first step is the analysis and simplification of local wind availability. Local wind availability is important for initial wind assessment at the urban scale. Furthermore, local wind data is necessary for the settings of the boundary condition for wind environment modeling at the city and building scales. The second step involves the modeling of the surrounding pedestrian airflow. The modeling results make detailed wind data available to all of wind engineers, urban planners, and architects for better understandings. The third step is the wind data collection. Both unbiased descriptions of the surrounding wind environment and critical wind-related design issue identification depend on an appropriate data collection process. Based on the robust application of the above three steps, the fourth step, the data interpretation can be confidently conducted. This step is critical in the decision-making process for building design implementation. A sufficient statistical analysis is necessary to summarize the collected wind data and correlate the modeling results with architectural design strategies. Then, knowledge-based decisions can be made by architects and urban planners.",

Compared with the modeling in the research work, the input conditions and proposed building morphologies are much more complicated in the real application. Requirements of architects in the data analysis are also very different with wind engineers and researchers. Thus, the current study focuses on the practical application of CFD simulation and aims to answer the questions that are often encountered by practicing wind consultants, architects, and planners: (1) how to set the appropriate boundary conditions, (2) how to verify the CFD simulation results in practical applications, and (3) how to collect and evaluate the simulation results to efficiently and accurately identify the important wind-related design issue for implementation. A procedural framework and methodologies for the practical application of CFD simulations in real architectural design process are provided in this study to make the CFD simulation more practical and dependable, as well as to make the results more helpful in architectural design. A case study in Hong Kong is conducted to illustrate how the proposed framework and methodologies can be used.",

Although the effect of the pressure drag of each building dominates the turbulent flow in the street canyon, the effects of pressure drag can be normalized or aggregated as the skin friction drag (shear stress) that results from the friction between large urban surfaces and air flow. This knowledge is considered as the quasi-physical reasoning that Prandtl\u2019s boundary layer theory presented in 1904 (Anderson, 2005), the logarithmic wind profile, is valid for the airflow structure above the large urban area (Oke, 1987).

Notably, the height of z\nr depends on the urban density [1.5 z\nH (averaged building height) for high-density areas; 4 z\nH for low-density areas] (Oke, 2004). From z\nr to \u03b4, the inhomogeneous building geometry length scales can be spatially-averaged by z\n0 [similar to \u03ba\n0 (K\u00e1rm\u00e1n constant) in the wall function of CFD], and the wind speed gradient in this layer can be estimated by z\n0 and z\nd (displacement height) using the logarithmic equation.",

Surface roughness classification is based on the repeatable and verified field observation results. Given its feasibility and accuracy, roughness classification is often used to set the surrounding surface roughness as a boundary condition in practical applications of CFD simulation.

The method makes the setting of the appropriate surrounding surface roughness easier. Grimmond and Oke (1999) conducted a broad and critical review to introduce various morphological models and to compare their sensitivities. Several models are only valid for low-density areas (Counihan, 1971, Kutzbach, 1961, Lettau, 1969, Raupach, 1992): kud and ku0: \u03bb\np\n \u2a7d 0.29; Le0: \u03bb\nf\n \u2a7d 02\u223c0.3; Co0: \u03bb\np\n \u2a7d 0.5; Ra0: \u03bb\nf\n \u2a7d 0.25. Although recently available models (Bottema, 1996, MacDonald et al., 1998) attempted to extend the limitation for large surface roughness, such as built areas, z0 meets the peak value with increasing roughness because of the skimming flow (Grimmond and Oke, 1999) (z\n0 meets the peak for \u03bb\nf, which is approximately 0.2 in Bottema\u2019s model (Bottema, 1996).

Plate (1999) reviewed several important issues for the wind tunnel experiment, such as the scaled modeling, input wind profile setting, and application framework of wind tunnel in urban planning. Kubota et al. (2008) conducted a 1:300 wind tunnel experiment to test the effect of local building density on pedestrian-level wind velocities. The atmospheric transport and dispersion around the World Trade Center site were examined by a 1:600 scale wind tunnel experiment (Perry et al., 2004). In Hong Kong, the Wind/Wave Tunnel Facility conducted experiments to understand the wind availability and flow characteristics at metropolitan areas (Hong Kong Planning Department, 2008), which were frequently used as the input data for city-scale CFD simulation.",

The domain of regional-scale simulation covered 480 km \u00d7 480 km \u00d7 5 km. The uniform horizontal grid size was 8 km \u00d7 8 km, and the vertical grid space was enlarged from 4 m above the ground by using a total of 20 vertical layers. The simulation at the local scale can be performed in the high resolution because of the super computational capability of the Earth simulator. Ashie et al.

First, apart from the setting issues clearly stated in the current guidelines (Frank, 2006, Tominaga et al., 2008), several important issues, such as grid dependence and convergence criteria, remain unclear. On one hand, because of the sophisticated real building morphologies, the quality of the mesh structure in real cases is not as good as that in parametric study, in which only simplified morphologies are used. Therefore, following the strict requirements for convergence criteria in real cases is more difficult than in parametric studies. COST 14 states that a reduction in scaled residuals of at least four orders of magnitude is required (Frank, 2006). A practical criterion of iterative convergence is needed for real case studies. On the other hand, given that real case conditions are always different, using a unified criterion for the grid dependence is also difficult.",

Furthermore, although efficient validation results can be obtained from the genetic model, such results still cannot validate the simulation results in real cases. It is because that the mesh structure in the generic model and that in real case studies are totally different. The grid is important for the modeling results (Tominaga et al., 2008).

Several important facts from the local analysis are as follows:a)As shown in Table 5, the wind polar at test point 1 represents the wind environment at the adjacent street in different wind directions. The wind velocity ratio in design option 3 in the input wind directions NE, NEE, E, and EES is significantly higher than that in design options 1 and 2. This result cannot be reflected by the averaged global analysis, in which the performance of options 2 and 3 are similar.b)As shown in Table 5, the wind polar at test point 31 compares the efficiency of the different design option strategies in terms of natural ventilation performance at the outdoor space in the secondary school. The wind velocity ratios in the input wind directions E, EES, ES, and ESS indicate that, among the three design options, the air can flow earliest through the proposed building in design option 3. Based on the above global and local analyses, the performances of options 2 and 3 are found to be globally better than that of option 1. At the location with strategic importance, design option 3 outperforms option 2.c)Even after identifying the optimal design option, a more detailed understanding can be obtained to improve the optimal design option further. The wind velocity ratio polar in Table 6 indicates that the natural ventilation performance at test point 24 in design option 3 can be significantly poorer than that in design option 1. As shown in Fig. 10\n, combining the wind polar and ground floor planning, the limitation can be identified to the part of the building in option 3 that is highlighted by in red.
