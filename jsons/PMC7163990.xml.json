All of these residues can influence chloride binding and therefore the chloride sensitivity of enzyme activity. Trp271 of ACE2 and the equivalent Trp279 tACE residue are also implicated in CL1 site\u2010mediated chloride sensitivity, as they are in close proximity to the CL1 chloride ion, with Trp271 of ACE2 also lying two residues upstream of Arg273, which is known to be critical for substrate binding [26].",

As reported previously, angiotensin I cleavage by tACE and ACE2 is activated by chloride ions [18, 20]. The activation profiles differ, however, between the two enzymes. tACE activity continues to increase as [NaCl] is increased up to 1 m (Fig. 3A), whereas maximal activity is obtained at approximately 500 mm NaCl for ACE2 (Fig. 3B). The degree of chloride activation of angiotensin I hydrolysis is greater for tACE than ACE2, with an 8.1\u2010fold increase in the level of activity recorded at 500 mm NaCl compared with 0 mm for tACE, whereas only a 3.9\u2010fold increase in ACE2 activity occurs. The effect of increasing chloride concentration on the rate of ACE2 cleavage of angiotensin II is distinct from, and more complex than, that of angiotensin I (Fig. 3C). A twofold increase in activity is observed as [NaCl] is increased from 0 to 100 mm, but any further increase in chloride concentration produces an inhibitory effect on activity, before a plateau is reached at 500 mm NaCl. Consequently, the level of activity at 500 mm NaCl is 1.6\u2010fold less than that in the absence of NaCl and 3.2\u2010fold less than that at 100 mm NaCl.",

However, there has been no previous report on the chloride sensitivity of the potency of the ACE2\u2010specific inhibitor MLN\u20104760. Hence, dose\u2013response curves were obtained for the inhibition of the ACE2 variants by MLN\u20104760, and the inhibition of the tACE variants by captopril, in the absence and presence of NaCl (500 mm). The IC50 values derived from these dose\u2013response curves showed that the inhibition of wild\u2010type ACE2 was sensitive to chloride concentration, as observed for wild\u2010type tACE (Fig. 5). The MLN\u20104760 IC50 value recorded at 500 mm NaCl was 10\u2010fold lower than that in the absence of chloride ions for wild\u2010type ACE2, and the captopril IC50 value with wild\u2010type tACE was decreased 3.3\u2010fold at 500 mm NaCl. The chloride sensitivity of inhibitor potency was lacking in R522Q tACE (Fig. 5A), which is in agreement with the absence of chloride sensitivity of angiotensin I cleavage by this variant (Fig. 4A). The R169Q ACE2 variant had an IC50 value 21\u2010fold and 9\u2010fold greater than that recorded for the wild\u2010type in the absence and presence of 500 mm NaCl, respectively (Fig. 5A).

It has been confirmed that an increase in [Cl\u2212] above 100 mm, which is the physiological concentration in human plasma [27], increases angiotensin I and decreases angiotensin II cleavage by ACE2 and increases angiotensin I cleavage by ACE. This would have the effect of increasing the localized concentration of the vasoconstrictor angiotensin II. A decrease in [Cl\u2212] would lead to the opposite scenario of a reduced localized angiotensin II concentration. The high levels of ACE and ACE2 in the kidney expose these enzymes to fluctuations in [Cl\u2212] which do not occur in the plasma. Therefore, in vivo Cl\u2212 sensitivity may serve to regulate the localized concentration of angiotensin peptides, particularly in the kidney, thus acting as a homeostatic regulatory mechanism.",

Arg186 and Arg489 of tACE, and the equivalent ACE2 residues Arg169 and Lys481, coordinate the chloride ion at this site by ionic interactions [22]. The removal of this interaction by mutagenesis abolishes or greatly reduces the level of chloride sensitivity. Trp271 of ACE2 is located in close proximity to the chloride ion at the CL1 site (4.88 \u00c5) and lies two residues upstream of Arg273, which is known to be critical for substrate binding [26]. By mutagenesis, Trp271 and the tACE equivalent Trp279 have also been identified as residues critical to the chloride sensitivity of the two enzymes. The CL1 site is unlikely to influence zinc binding as it is 20.7 \u00c5 from this ion in tACE [22]. However, it has been suggested to be important in stabilizing complex formation for the residues in subdomain II involved directly in substrate binding [20].",

            "text": "The CL2 site of ACE has previously been suggested to contain the mechanistically binding chloride ion, which, when bound by the enzyme, breaks the salt bridge between Arg522 and Asp465 of C\u2010domain sACE and facilitates the movement of Tyr523 towards the active site [30]. It was found in this study that the tACE CL2 site mutant R522Q possesses no significant chloride sensitivity, as predicted from a previous study of the equivalent R1098Q sACE mutant [25]. Arg522(Arg1098) is consequently critical to the chloride dependence of both tACE and sACE. The X\u2010ray crystal structure of tACE reveals that Arg522, in combination with Tyr224 and a water molecule, binds the chloride ion at the CL2 site [22]. The ionic interaction of this residue with the chloride ion is therefore essential to the chloride sensitivity mediated by the CL2 site. Although the CL2 site chloride is absent in ACE2 [24], the R514Q variant affects the chloride sensitivity of the enzyme, with the observed increase in activity being twofold less than that of the wild\u2010type with angiotensin I and absent with angiotensin II. In ACE2, it would thus appear that this mutation is able to transmit long\u2010range effects on the chloride sensitivity of the enzyme induced by the CL1 site. The chloride sensitivity of the tACE and ACE2 triple mutants was consistently found to be similar to that of R522Q tACE and R514Q ACE2, respectively. This suggests that it is R522/R514 that has the greatest influence on the chloride regulation of activity, and that the CL2 site of ACE does indeed contain the mechanistically binding chloride ion.",

The removal of the positive charge of this residue by the creation of an R514Q mutant produces an enzyme that, compared with the wild\u2010type, shows twofold greater activity with the substrate angiotensin II, but twofold less activity with angiotensin I at physiological [NaCl]. The crystal structure of ACE2 reveals that the topology and chemical environment of the S1 subsite is dictated by four residues (Tyr510, Arg514, Phe504 and Thr347), which are expected to restrict the size of substrate P1 side\u2010chains [24]. Therefore, the R514Q mutation most probably alters the environment of the S1 subsite to make it more favourable for angiotensin II hydrolysis, but less favourable for angiotensin I hydrolysis. The kinetic data confirm that this variant has a threefold greater catalytic efficiency than the wild\u2010type with angiotensin II, and this is not a result of an alteration in substrate\u2010binding affinity but of an increase in V\nmax. The R514Q ACE2 variant or variants with enhanced activity towards angiotensin II have potential therapeutic value in acute lung injury, as mice suffering from this condition have previously shown markedly improved disease following the injection of recombinant ACE2 into the abdomen [11].",

            "text": "In this study, the potency of both tACE and ACE2 inhibitors was discovered to be chloride sensitive, with high [Cl\u2212] increasing inhibitor potency. This is believed to occur as a result of the facilitation of inhibitor binding by the conformational changes induced by chloride binding. Intriguingly, in contrast with these findings, the potency of ACE inhibitors is known to be increased in rats subjected to low\u2010salt diets [31]. It is therefore apparent that there are additional salt\u2010sensitive mechanisms in vivo that influence ACE inhibitor potency, and that these override the chloride binding\u2010induced alteration in ACE inhibitor potency observed here. The ACE2 residues Arg169 and Arg514 have been identified as critical to the potency of MLN\u20104760, as their mutation drastically reduces the IC50 values recorded in comparison with the wild\u2010type. Arg514 of ACE2 is located next to the S1 subsite [24], and so the R514Q mutation is hypothesized to have altered the environment of this region to one that is less accommodating to MLN\u20104760 binding. Arg169 of ACE2 is approximately 16 \u00c5 from the dichlorobenzyl group of MLN\u20104760 [24] and so is unlikely to directly hinder inhibitor binding. The most probable explanation is that the R169Q mutation transmits a conformational change to the active site over a long distance, which makes the environment for MLN\u20104760 binding less favourable.",
