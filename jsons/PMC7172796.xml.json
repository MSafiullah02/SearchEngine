If insufficiently treated, this infectious waste may provide pathways for the further transmission of infectious water- and faecal-borne diseases. In the US and many other high-income countries with presumably adequate treatment facilities, human faecal waste and other potentially infectious bodily fluids from healthcare facilities can be discharged directly into local sewage systems. In situ pre-treatment of such human waste is sometimes encouraged under certain conditions such the introduction of high risk diseases and their pathogens into the population, such as cholera (Ashbolt, 2004) (Centers for Disease and Prevention, 2010), typhoid fever (Murphy et al., 2017), Ebola (CDC, 2014a; b) and infectious hepatitis (Craun et al., 2010) (Sehulster et al., 2003) (Spina et al., 2017). The World Health Organization (WHO), has recommendations for management of such wastes using a disinfection option (Pr\u00fcss et al., 1999; WHO, 2014; WHO and Unicef, 2014). However, the efficacy of existing protocols for in situ inactivation of pathogens in human faecal waste by physico-chemical disinfection processes is uncertain, especially in raw faecal matter and high strength wastewater (Bibby et al., 2015, 2017; Schuit et al., 2016; Tondera et al., 2015, 2016). Chemical agents such as chlorine bleach (Tree et al., 2003), hydrated lime, peracetic acid (Allievi et al., 1994; Kitis, 2004), alcohol (Springthorpe et al., 1986; Tung et al., 2013), phenolic substances (Abad et al., 1997; Mbithi et al., 1990), anionic detergents (Gerba and Kennedy, 2007), and quaternary ammonium compounds, such as benzalkonium chloride (BNZ) (Tarbox et al., 1998) and cetylpyridinium chloride (Russell, 1999), are the main disinfectants currently used in health care settings. However, the suitability and effectiveness of these compounds for disinfecting complex matrices with high organic content has not been adequately demonstrated and use parameters have not been developed based on experimental evidence. Some of the abovementioned outbreaks of highly contagious diseases have been associated with insufficiently treated sewage: such outbreaks indicate that improved and better documented methods are needed to ensure the effectiveness of chemical disinfection protocols for infectious faecal wastes and sewage.",

Such chemical neutralization of disinfectant chemicals in disinfection experiments is standard practice to allow for reliable culture based assays of faecal indicator bacteria (e.g. Escherichia coli or Enterococcus faecalis (APHA, 2010a; c)) as bacterial pathogen surrogates, bacteriophages such as somatic coliphages (APHA, 2010d; Gall et al., 2016), FRNA phages (Shahrampour et al., 2015), Bacteroides phages (Ebdon et al., 2012), and bacteriophage \u03c66 (Casanova and Weaver, 2015b) (Casanova and Weaver, 2015a) as virus pathogen surrogates in complex sewage and faecal waste matrices. Failure to achieve adequate chemical neutralization of the disinfectant used in an experiment can result in flawed disinfection kinetics estimates based on CT conditions because inactivation could continue after the experiment is completed due to variable and unknown remaining concentrations of the disinfectant or its biocidal by-products. Such overestimation may result in flawed disinfection protocols that produce inaccurate disinfection kinetics. Most studies investigating the antimicrobial properties of chemicals that have been published in recent years do not address the quantitative neutralization of the disinfecting agent (Kingsley et al., 2017; Peng et al., 2012; Zanetti et al., 1996).",

However, for some chemical disinfectants there is no simple and standard methodology to measure its residual concentration. After attempted neutralization, residual disinfectant may be present at low concentrations and be active, unless the chemical agents or its antimicrobial effects are shown to be absent. Therefore, it is necessary to reliably assess neutralization efficacy of the disinfectant and determine the minimum required amount of neutralizer to assure absence of the disinfectant at the end of the specified contact time (T). For those chemical disinfectants whose concentrations are difficult and impractical to measure in the waste matrix, a microbial bioassay-based approach to determining their chemical neutralization in a complex waste matrix is proposed in the presented work.",

The presented work aims to provide a reliable but simple method to determine if a chemical disinfectant in a complex faecal matrix is neutralized adequately by using a bioassay procedure that documents the culturability of target microbes. The described protocol aims to ensure that adequate neutralization of the disinfectant is achieved, so that it does not interfere with subsequent culture-based microbial analysis of the processed sample. The use of bacterial and viral indicator organisms spiked into pasteurized or autoclaved wastewater is preferred to the use of naturally occurring organisms in waste matrix samples for two reasons. First, the use of non-pathogenic indicators protects the health and safety of laboratory researchers. Second, the use of culturable indicator organisms enables high initial titers to be used, simplifying the process of quantifying disinfection performance and subsequent chemical neutralization of the disinfectant, based on quantifiable microbial levels (i.e. counts higher, therefore statistically more significant and ultimately more accurate).",

The establishment of a practical, simple and adaptable protocol, for reliable chemical neutralization of disinfectants used in in-situ waste disinfection applications was the main objective of this work. In the presented work, a bioassay approach utilizing both bacteria and bacteriophages was applied to the specific case of the quaternary ammonium disinfectant benzalkonium chloride (BNZ) as an example disinfectant for in-situ treatment of health care associated faecal waste.

Most of the available BNZ disinfection literature does not provide precise levels of the ratios of Tween 80\u00ae/lecithin and/or other neutralizing chemicals nor do the studies include detailed information on the ratio of neutralization mixture to the disinfection agent. Most do not investigate the efficacy of neutralization in complex matrices such as simulated faecal waste samples. To our knowledge, the presented work is the first attempt to design a standardized approach to measure residual BNZ using a microbial bioassay after attempted chemical neutralization. Furthermore, the bioassay described here represents an improvement if compared to the abovementioned studies, as it presents the advantage of addressing the issue of potential microbial inactivation by neutralizers.",

            "text": "\u03c66 was not the only bacteriophage that was considered as a possible surrogate for enveloped viruses, with the aim to evaluate disinfection residual. Here a brief explanation of the rationale of our final choice. Recent years have shown emerging numbers of outbreaks associated with enveloped viruses such as Ebola virus (Baize et al., 2014), Coronaviruses such as SARS (Hsieh et al., 2004) or viruses associated with the Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) (Haagmans et al., 2014). Their high persistence towards disinfection methods coupled with their low infectious dose and high numbers of infectious viruses excreted with human waste lead required biosafety facilities of levels 3 or 4 to safely handle them. Therefore, enveloped bacteriophages \u03c66 (Vidaver et al., 1973) are currently discussed as suitable surrogates due to several of their advantageous characteristics such as the non-human pathogenic nature of both \u03c66 and P. syringae, their bacterial host (Wei et al., 2009) which allows their handling under bio safety level 1 (equivalent to minimal containment) (Gallandat and Lantagne, 2017). In addition, \u03c66 is easily cultivated, can be analysed rapidly using established culture techniques such as plaque assays and is \u2013 compared to other enveloped bacteriophages of the family Cystoviridae (Mindich et al., 1999) \u2013 well described and characterized in literature (Laurinavicius et al., 2004). Still, a recent study by de Carvalho et al. (2017) indicates that even though \u03c66 shows behavioural similarities to enveloped enteric viruses of the highest public health relevance, certain limitations in regards of their persistence towards temperature and their decay rate in deionized and natural waters exist.",

Recent studies on best practice to perform rapid in situ chemical disinfection of human sewage and faecal wastes in healthcare settings have utilized different established and routinely used disinfectants such as chlorine bleach, hydrated lime, alcohol or phenol-based substances, anionic detergents and quaternary ammonium compounds, such as BNZ and cetylpyridinium chloride, under different use conditions of exposure time and disinfectant concentrations in varied waste matrices. The main aim of this study was to define an adaptable, effective and scalable protocol for the chemical neutralization of any candidate chemical disinfectant when testing and optimizing its performance efficacy in high strength human faecal waste matrices using a microbial bioassay system in the absence of a reliable and available method to analyse disinfectant residual after attempted chemical neutralization (see Table 7).",

The results are consistent with those of previous studies in different waste matrices and contexts of health care facilities (Gainor et al., 1997; Msellati et al., 1999; Tarbox et al., 1998). Subsequent experiments showed that, at greater neutralizer concentration, bacterial (or viral) growth increased. Bacteria growth and the formation of plaques on a lawn of host bacteria in the case of bacteriophage \u03c66 were benchmarked for efficacy in the experimental setup in the absence of active disinfectant as a control, with expected results. Negative controls, which included either 1) no disinfectant and no neutralizer or 2) only neutralizer without added disinfectant, confirmed bacterial growth in both conditions and showed that the bioassay was performing as expected in absence of disinfection and neutralization. As expected, the neutralizers had no adverse effect on bacterial or viral growth. Disinfectant positive controls, containing BNZ plus the indicator bacteria or viruses, showed no microbial growth as was expected.",

Chemical neutralization in the faecal waste sample and in PBS further documented that higher amounts of neutralization mixture did not adversely impact the growth of either bacteria or the infectivity of the bacteriophages used as bioassay microbes. To our knowledge, the presented work constitutes the first study which successfully establishes and reproducibly tests a practical, flexible and easily scalable methodology and bioassay-based stepwise protocol to evaluate and use during in-situ chemical disinfection studies of waste matrices.

However, these publications do not adequately address current situations where there is a need to assess the efficacy of disinfection and sterilizations assays for a broad variety of pathogenic microorganisms in high strength complex faecal waste matrices with high concentrations of oxidizable constituents and high risk persistent and emerging pathogens such as enveloped viruses. This protocol attempts to serve as a general methodology to be applied for chemical neutralization disinfectant chemicals in studies investigating disinfection of highly oxidizable human faecal waste and other liquid samples in many contexts of health care or emergency response settings. To our knowledge the approach and methods presented here are the first standardized protocol that address the chemical disinfection and the neutralization of the faecal waste matrices that are the focus of this research (so called \u2018worst case\u2019 matrices). The protocols that are currently available for disinfection testing of healthcare biocides are not adequately representative of the kinds of human waste samples and conditions addressed by this study. This highly adaptable protocol enabled an accurate assessment of neutralization of disinfectant at any given disinfectant concentration and contact time. The adaptive nature of the protocol could be used to determine the optimal chemical neutralization procedure of a disinfectant applied to any given faecal waste or other highly organic liquid waste matrix to be disinfected for public health protection (Manasfi et al., 2017; Schaefer et al., 2017; Ufermann et al., 2011).",
