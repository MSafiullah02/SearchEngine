            "text": "A number of nucleic acid hybridization and amplification methods are now in use, including direct probe hybridization (AdvanDx FISH for Staphylococcus aureus [AdvanDx] and GenProbe for group A streptococci [GenProbe]), hybrid capture (Digene for human papillomavirus; Digene), PCR, branched-chain DNA (bDNA; Bayer Diagnostics), and transcription-mediated amplification (Probe-Tec for Chlamydia and N. gonorrhoeae; Becton Dickinson). Sample volume (which encompasses both original sample volume and number of nucleic acid sequences present in the final amplified sample portion), transport conditions, dilution factors, inhibitory factors, genome changes, instrument problems, and operator error all contribute to false-positive and false-negative test results [6, 15\u201318]. Even closed systems at the detection end do not prevent cross-contamination from positive sample processing at the front end. For example, current FDA restrictions require that Papanicolaou smears be first performed when a single suspension of cervical cells is received in preservative, with requests for both cytology and for detection of human papillomavirus, Chlamydia species, and N. gonorrhoeae; this contributes to the common finding that insufficient sample size remains for the infectious diseases tests after the Papanicolaou sample has been removed [19]. Unfortunately, unlike direct visual examinations in which sample quality can be assessed, a negative result of such an assay includes no comment on the quality of the specimen. Although molecular tests that use whole blood samples for detection of the agents of sepsis are not yet available, several such assays are in development. Volume will be a factor in the sensitivity of these tests. The amount of bacteria in blood obtained from a patient with bacteremia is often <1 cfu/mL [20], yet the volume used in most NAA reaction vials is <10 \u00b5L. Even if the sample is concentrated in some way, the chance that microbial genetic material will reach the reaction vial could be very small, resulting in false-negative results. In samples containing human neutrophils or erythrocytes\u2014the very samples most likely to harbor the infectious agent\u2014it is challenging to concentrate microbial DNA without also adding overwhelming amounts of human somatic DNA, and the available front-end methods (extraction and filtration columns, magnetic particle capture, and silica-based systems) still lack efficiency [21, 22]. Manufacturers are spending most of their energy on back-end technology (detection and reporting). Front-end processing is urgently needed, ideally resulting in the development of a creative new method for concentrating cell-rich specimens (such as purulent fluid, blood, and sputum) from humans to allow for sensitive detection of microbial nucleic acids.",

            "text": "Diagnosis of tuberculous meningitis is another example of the problems inherent in amplification technology using PCR [23]. Patients may have confounding signs and symptoms, the number of organisms in the CSF sample may be very low, and conventional tests are insensitive and/or slow. Direct acid-fast staining of CSF specimens has a sensitivity of \u223c52% [24]. The volume of CSF needed for adequate culture is at least 5 mL (preferably 10 mL), because Mycobacterium tuberculosis is extremely buoyant in CSF as a result of its waxy cell wall; thus, concentration by centrifugation is inefficient [25]. Smears for acid-fast bacilli made from the sediment must be layered and examined exhaustively\u2014sometimes for 30 min\u2014in the hope of detecting the rare M. tuberculosis rod [23]. NAA would seem to be the answer. Sadly, NAA tests display an overall sensitivity of 71% (range, 25%\u2013100%) and a specificity of 95% (range, 92%\u201397%), as determined by a meta-analysis of 49 published studies, 35 of which used home-brewed (individual laboratory\u2014developed and \u2014validated) methods [26]. When results from the 14 laboratories that used commercially available assays were evaluated separately, the overall sensitivity decreased to 56% (range, 46%\u201366%). These are the assays that are likely to be available to most clinicians. The NAA results were equal to those for the acid-fast bacilli smear. Clinicians must realize that unwanted reliance on new technology may lead to diagnostic errors.",

There are also pitfalls in this approach. For example, many organisms, although they may be antigenically or biochemically distinct, are virtually genetically identical. Members of the Bacteroides fragilis group, for example, are highly related and cannot be separated easily by standard sequencing methods [27]. Most clinicians realize that Escherichia coli and Shigella species are highly related [28], but they have not considered the difficulty that this relatedness would pose if we relied on sequencing to identify these genera directly in patient samples. The extent of shared genes and taxonomically (versus phenotypically) shared traits among most microbes is unknown.",

Rhinosporidium seeberi, for example, is an agent of mass lesions in the sinus and mucous membranes. This organism has often been observed in histopathologic sections, but it has never been grown in culture. It resembles the spherule of Coccidioides immitis, however, so it has long been considered an \u201cunculturable\u201d fungus. Recently, 18s rRNA sequencing placed the organism into a group of protozoan fish parasites [29]. We are constantly faced with new names for familiar organisms\u2014and even with new organisms that may or may not be important in familiar syndromes. Before more-extensive testing was performed, the newly discovered Mycoplasma fermentans (originally called Mycoplasma incognitus) had been implicated in both Gulf War syndrome and HIV infection [30, 31]. It was later found to be quite common in humans [32]. After effective therapy, results of PCR of genital samples obtained from patients with C. trachomatis remain positive for >2 weeks [33]. Nucleic acid is detectable but probably not viable. We do not know the extent of carriage of unculturable microbial or \u201cnormal\u201d microbial DNA in other healthy hosts.",

            "text": "The cost of equipment, expensive reagents, and additional skilled personnel needed is not easy to justify. For example, the FDA has cleared a real-time PCR test for group B streptococcal vaginal/rectal colonization during labor [34]. Widespread use of this test could negate the need to perform cultures for pregnant women during weeks 35\u201337 of gestation, and it would solve the problems associated with treating women who present in labor without screening test results [35]. Currently, 25% of women receive prophylactic penicillin during labor [36]. This number would decrease if only women with PCR results positive for group B streptococci at labor were treated [36, 37]. The problem, however, is that current recommendations [38] have already reduced the incidence of early-onset neonatal group B streptococcal disease to less than the 2010 National Health Objective of 0.5 cases per 1000 live births, and additional improvement is not cost-effective [39]. Lucile Packard Childrens Hospital Johnson Center, a Stanford University Medical Center affiliate on the same campus, delivers \u223c1800 babies annually. To perform the PCR assay immediately after each sample is received (a necessity to assure that prophylaxis is administered for at least 4 h before delivery), we would have to staff 1 technologist at all times. Test performance takes \u223c15 min of hands-on time, and the test itself runs 45 min, so a technologist must perform continuous sample management. Twenty-four/seven staffing for 365 days per year would require 3.9 clinical laboratory scientists, at a labor and overhead cost of $316,875. The reagents\u2014not counting the cost of the instrument itself\u2014cost $46,800 annually, for a total yearly cost of $363,675. Stanford University Medical Center (Stanford, CA) patients have a colonization rate of 17% among women in labor, resulting in 306 babies at risk per year. To prevent 3 potential group B streptococcal infections using this test, the cost per infection avoided would be $121,225. This is a hard sell to hospital administrators who are focused on the bottom line. Potential laboratory staff labor savings with the use of random-access, moderately complex molecular systems, such as GeneXpert (mentioned above), may help to bring down costs.",

            "text": "Proteomics (i.e., profiling the proteins generated by human cells in response to various stimuli, including components and products of infectious agents) is in its infancy, but exciting developments are enticing. The spots of DNA or RNA on \u201cgene chips\u201d can be designed to be homologous with nucleic acid sequences in the sample, representing nucleic acids found in both the normal situation and the activated state of transcription or representing various genetic sequences unique to a vast array of microbes for detection of infectious agents [44]. Samples are treated to break down their DNA or RNA into small discrete sequences, for which an identical sequence exists on the chip. If the sample nucleic acid finds its match, it binds and emits an electronic signal [45]. Such a human-response chip can be used to determine a patient's response to potentially toxic antimicrobial treatments in advance of delivery. If the patient lacks enzymes to break down toxins or cannot metabolize a drug effectively, alternative therapies can be used to avoid dangerous adverse effects [46]. In another prospective microarray-based test, human leukocyte response to various infectious agents may be used to pinpoint the etiology before the agent itself can be detected [47]. Development of this sort of technology is on a fast track, to facilitate detection of bioterrorism agents before the symptomatic phase of disease renders widespread preventive measurements inadequate [48]. Proteomics is being used to fine-tune the development of new anti-infectives as well [49]. One aspect of microarray technology yet to be standardized and codified is the monumental problem of data analysis [50]. An entire new discipline of bioinformatics has developed for this purpose. This challenge of interpreting the vast volume of data points generated by microarray studies is acquired along with the technological advances, and its resolution will require a collective and extensive effort.",
