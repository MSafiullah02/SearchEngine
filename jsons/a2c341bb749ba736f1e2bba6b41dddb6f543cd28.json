A massive screening program was implemented for individuals in close contact with infected or high-risk individuals. 5 The strict control in Wuhan has been effective, with the daily reported confirmed cases significantly reduced from 1,500 to 2,000 at its peak to 10 cases or less a day. 6 However, the implementation of the quarantine has also severely damaged its economy, with predictions that the Chinese economy will grow by less than 4% in the first quarter of 2020. 7 The daily life of Wuhan residents has also been seriously disrupted, and the long duration of home containment may result in mental and psychological issues. 8 Lifting the metropolitan-wide quarantine is imminent. Since late February, major cities across China have gradually eased their restriction levels and partially resumed public transportation. 9 As the epicenter of the outbreak, Wuhan faces the dilemma of balancing the substantial accumulating economic losses with the hard-earned control of the epidemic. Lifting the quarantine restrictions in the city and reopening transport links with the rest of China has become the top priority for the policy makers. We aim to determine what level of the two commonly used control measures, social distancing and facial mask usage, are necessary to prevent a resurgence of the epidemic due to either residual active cases in Wuhan or imported cases after lifting the quarantine.",

When public contact recovered to 100% the pre-quarantine level and facial mask usage was high at 95%, the epidemic would follow a smooth decline to elimination regardless of which day quarantine was lifted ( Figure S4A ). In contrast, when facial mask usage was reduced to 50%, any quarantine lifting date before April 25 would result in a second major outbreak (Figure S4B) . Similarly, when facial mask usage was sustained at 80%, and the public contact rate was recovered to 100% of the pre-quarantine level, an earlier lifting on March 21 may lead to a second minor outbreak (Figure S4C) . But, if the public contact rate was 50% more than the pre-quarantine level, a second major outbreak would occur with all quarantine lifting dates except April 25 ( Figure S4D ).",

However, a low facial mask usage (<50%) combined with increased public contact (>100%) would always lead to a significant second outbreak in most quarantine lifting scenarios.

            "text": "The quarantine has substantially altered the transmission pattern of the virus in Wuhan.While our model predicts that public transmission accounts for the majority of transmission prior to the quarantine, household transmission is the dominant route of transmission during quarantine, consistent with a previous study. 12 This is intuitively reasonable because the quarantine has significantly reduced the public contacts of the residents and increased their contacts with family members in a closed household environment. In cases where the epidemic is able to be contained without a second outbreak, the dominant route of transmission would switch back to public transmission after lifting the quarantine (Figure S5A ). In cases where the epidemic results in a second major outbreak ( Figure S5B ), the second outbreak would be predominantly driven by household transmission. Our estimate that~70% of all infected cases were due to household transmission is also in broad agreement with a recent report from the World Health Organization (78%-85% 10 ). Further, we estimated 5% hospital-acquired infections in patients (1.1%) and medical staff (3.8%), which is consistent with a recent clinical report. 11 Our study suggests that maintaining a reduction in the contact rate below the pre-quarantine levels is an important ongoing intervention until a vaccine is available. If residents return to the same level of activities as pre-quarantine, a very high level of facial mask usage rate of 85% (or other powerful interventions) will be required. Any additional public interactions, such as the influx of the five million residents returning to Wuhan, may trigger a second outbreak. Governments will need to determine how to minimize public contacts from workplaces,venues for essential daily commodities, residents, leisure, entertainment venues, and public events although limiting or modifying the latter may be important. Intercity travel should be minimized, and the return of the residents may need to be staged. The full restoration of intercity public transportation may take months, and careful planning of the size of population inflow is necessary.",
