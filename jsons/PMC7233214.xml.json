COVID-19, caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has strongly affected almost every country across the globe, leading to >300,000 deaths. As such, Latin American countries such as Mexico, Brazil, Ecuador, Peru, Chile, and Argentina, among others, are deeply impacted. In many Latin American countries, the government has mandated total quarantine to minimize virus exposure in the population in an attempt to flatten the epidemiologic curve of the disease. Health care workers are split into work groups to improve working conditions and to try to guarantee coverage of any necessary medical disease. In addition, substantial undocumented infection is enormously facilitating transmission,1 and Latin American countries have limited resources for screening all asymptomatic patients.",

How Long Does It Take?\u201d The impact of timing on surgical intervention in spine trauma cases has been demonstrated in previous studies for cervical2 and thoracolumbar3 spine trauma. Notably, cases with incomplete deficit are generally more urgently treated compared with cases with complete spinal cord injury.4 The impact of early surgery on the outcome of complete cervical traumatic spinal cord injury was demonstrated: to promote neurologic recovery, surgical decompression of the spinal cord within 24 hours seems particularly beneficial.5\n",

Many intensive care units are completely occupied or, when they are not, availability for patients who do not have COVID-19 is not considered a priority owing to the estimated projection of the virus spreading7 based on information obtained from outside of Latin America and influenced by the beginning of the disease in a specific country.",

When these patients present with spine trauma, there is no knowledge regarding SARS-CoV-2 status, including in low-risk or asymptomatic patients, thereby impacting the final outcome if the patient treated has COVID-19,8 and sometimes the surgery is already performed, having the potential to spread the infection to health care workers.",

In Latin America, even without a pandemic, limitations of resources already exist, such as adequate spinal implants, intensive care unit beds, operating room availability, and a good spine team. This reality is likely to become worse. Finally, a longer waiting list of patients with other spine pathologies for elective surgeries is expected, especially in the poorest locations.",
