Specialised codecs that rely on explicitly stored segmentations excel in this task since they preserve discontinuities between smooth regions. However, current approaches rely on ad hoc segmentations that lack a clean interpretation in terms of energy minimisation. As a remedy, we derive a generic region merging algorithm from the Mumford-Shah cartoon model. It adapts the segmentation to arbitrary reconstruction operators for the segment content. In spite of its conceptual simplicity, our framework can outperform previous segment-based compression methods as well as BPG by up to 3 dB.",

It consists of a data term that measures the approximation quality and a regulariser which penalises the length of the segmentation boundaries. The original Mumford-Shah cartoon model approximates the data within each segment by their average grey value. For most compression approximations this is too crude. As a remedy, we use an inpaintingbased approximation which relies on data specified on a sparse regular grid. Our experiments will show that this adaptation can lead to codecs that are simple, fast, and qualitatively significantly superior to a state-of-the-art method in segmentbased compression [4] , as well as the transform-based Better Portable Graphics (BPG) [5] . Moreover, our framework is fairly generic: Within each segment, we can use arbitrary reconstructions by inpainting as well as reconstructions by polynomial approximations.",
