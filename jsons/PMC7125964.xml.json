The pathophysiology of acute exacerbations of COPD is incompletely understood, but increased concentrations of proinflammatory mediators and inflammatory cells in expectorated sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage samples, and tissue biopsied from the lung during exacerbations demonstrate the presence of inflammation within and surrounding airways [17], [18], [19]. During an acute exacerbation, this inflammation assumes characteristics of an allergic response increased eosinophils and upregulation of RANTES (regulated upon activation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted) in the epithelium and subepithelium [20]. Common triggers for acute exacerbations of COPD include airway infections [21], particulate air pollution [22], and environmental temperature changes [23], although up to 30% of patients have no clinically apparent etiologic factor [24]. Patients with acute exacerbations commonly have associated conditions such as congestive heart failure, pulmonary emboli, and extrapulmonary infections.",

One recent study indicates that exacerbations due to viral bronchitis are more severe compared with nonviral exacerbations, and are associated with a longer time to recovery [30].

As shown by the spirometric flow-volume loops in Fig. 1\n, normal individuals breathe at rest with expiratory air flows that are well within the limits of their maximal flow rate capacity. Healthy persons, therefore, do not reach their maximal flow rates even with vigorous exercise. In contrast, patients with moderate to severe COPD have tidal volume flow rates that are at or near their maximal flow rate capacity [32]. During an acute exacerbation, patients' attempts to increase minute ventilation by increasing tidal volume are limited by the low maximal flow rates. Patients respond with an increased respiratory rate, which decreases the time available for expiratory emptying of alveoli through narrowed airways. Patients experience progressive trapping of air within the lung (\u201cdynamic hyperinflation\u201d), which increases work of breathing [33]. Eventually, increasing fatigue prevents patients from meeting their ventilatory demands and causes hypercapnic respiratory failure [34]. Based on this pathophysiology of respiratory failure in COPD, management centers on decreasing airway resistance and decreasing work of breathing by \u201cunloading\u201d ventilatory demands on respiratory muscles to treat or prevent respiratory muscle fatigue.",

The faster onset of action of \u03b2-agonists and the lower frequency of adverse effects with anticholinergic drugs determine drug selection for individual patients. No differences exist between the administration of inhaled bronchodilators by meter dose inhalers with a spacer or a jet nebulizer [36]. Initial therapy is usually started with a nebulizer, however, because critically ill patients with acute respiratory distress may experience difficulties using meter dose inhalers [35].

Ventilatory support provides an increased minute ventilation to correct abnormalities in gas exchange, and unloads respiratory muscles to allow recovery from respiratory muscle fatigue. Although the specific techniques of mechanical ventilation are beyond the scope of the present article, general principles center on the avoidance of dynamic hyperinflation. Patients with acute respiratory failure have increased airflow limitation, which slows expiratory airflow and delays alveolar empyting. Mechanical ventilation with large tidal volumes and rapid respiratory rates produce dynamic hyperinflation and raised alveolar pressures at end expiration, which is termed autopositive end expiratory pressure (auto-PEEP). Auto-PEEP interferes with patients' abilities to spontaneously trigger the ventilator, creates discomfort that may require heavy sedation, and compromises cardiac function. Strategies to avoid dynamic hyperinflation include use of lower tidal volumes, increased inspiratory flow rates, and moderate respiratory rates. Use of applied-PEEP at a lower level than measured auto-PEEP may enhance ventilator triggering and promote patient comfort. More detailed reviews of ventilator strategies for patients with COPD are reviewed elsewhere [53].",

These factors combined with the improved access to the lower airways for pulmonary toilet and decreased airway resistance during weaning trials promote successful weaning. We evaluate patients for tracheotomy after 7 days of intubation. If successful extubation appears unlikely during the next several days, we proceed to tracheotomy to promote patient comfort and an early weaning from ventilatory support [57].",

For patients who require intubation and mechanical ventilation, comorbidities, and acute illness severity scores are predictive of survival [54]. Requirements for mechanical ventilation beyond 72 hours and extubation followed by reintubation are associated with a high mortality [54]. Connors et al reported data from The Study to Understand Prognoses and Preferences for Outcomes and Risks of Treatments that found an independent association of severity of illness scores, body mass index, older age, prior functional status, severity of hypoxia, congestive heart failure, serum albumin, and the presence of cor pulmonale with survival [63].
