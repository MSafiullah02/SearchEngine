Owing to their success in computer vision tasks, the state-of-the-art Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs) or U-Net based models have often been employed in many recent studies for automatic tumor segmentation to learn numerous weight-shared convolutional kernels and extract various semantic features. However, the correlation between different tumor regions in feature maps cannot be easily captured due to the lack of contextual dependencies, which in turn limits the representative capability of the adopted models and thus affects the accuracy of tumor segmentation results. To resolve this issue, we propose a novel framework for segmentation of tumors in liver CT scans, which can explicitly extract multi-scale fine-grained contextual information by adaptively aggregating local features with their global dependencies. The proposed multi-scale framework features a light model with a very few additional parameters, and also its visualization capability significantly boosts networks' interpretability. Experimental results on a real-world liver tumor CT dataset illustrate that the proposed framework achieves the state-of-the-art performance in terms of a number of widely used evaluation criteria for the hepatic tumor segmentation task.",

Furthermore, there were more than a total of 840,000 new cases diagnosed in 2018 which was 1.074 times more than that in 2012 [2, 3] . Besides having a healthy diet and being physically active, an early detection and intervention is also critical in mitigating the risk of liver cancer. Currently, with the rapid development of medical imaging technology, CT and MRI medical imaging examinations have been widely used in clinical applications to monitor the liver structure and state for diagnosis and treatment of liver cancer [4] . However, manually analyzing detected imaging slices is really a time-consuming and error-prone task to conduct for physicians and radiologists alike and there often exist some inter-observer variations for this kind of pixel-level labelling tasks [5] . Therefore, an accurate and automatic hepatic lesions/tumors localization and segmentation approach is urgently required as a diagnostic aid for early liver cancer detection.",

            "text": "However, in medical tumor segmentation tasks from liver scans, there still exist several hard challenges, with hepatic tumors as an example, such as low tissue contrast, large variability in tumor shape, size and number among inter-patient CT scans and intrapatient slices, and the vague boundary problem between diseased and healthy regions in the whole liver. In recent years, Fully Convolutional Networks (FCNs) [6] and U-Net [7] based deep neural networks have been widely utilized in biomedical and medical image segmentation tasks with an outstanding success [9, 11, 12] . Both types of network architectures utilize skip connections to integrate shallow feature maps and high semantic feature maps from different scales, which can generate more precise pixel-level recognition by fusing detailed positional information from shallow layers. Still, it should be noted that the range of contextual information obtained from those models is heavily limited by the depth of networks and the size of kernels used. Several recent works [13] modify these basic architectures by introducing multi-scale context fusion motivated by the Inception-ResNet-V2 model, where a large reception field can extract more abstract features for large objects, while a small reception field is better for small objects. Even though fusing multi-scale contextual information can capture different size objects, it cannot leverage the correlation between different objects in a global context, which is very important for medical tumor segmentation, in particular, segmenting common multiple tumors in a liver. To further exploit contextual dependencies, U-Net variants based on Recurrent Neutral Networks (RNNs) have been proposed to aggregate the context over local features from output feature maps of top layers of pre-trained CNN models [16] . Despite the enhancement of their representative capability, the implicitly captured global dependencies heavily rely on the learning outcome of the long-term memorization [17] .",

More specifically, we first construct a new U-shape model motivated by CE-Net [13] , where the pre-trained ResNet model and different size context aggregation with dilated convolutions and a multi-kernel pyramid pooling are fused into an encoder-decoder architecture. Then, we place the multi-scale context extraction model on all the skip connections to capture fine-grained contextual information by adaptively aggregating local features with their global dependencies from different scale feature maps, respectively. Finally, for a context extraction block on each skip connection, we model the semantic context interdependencies over all the local features from both the spatial and the channel dimensions. In this way, the spatial contextual relationship can avoid the effect of the position distance between tumor regions in 2D feature maps and meanwhile, aggregate tumor features at each location by summing a global dependency on all the related tumor features. Furthermore, a global interdependent channel affinity map is also computed to exploit and emphasize the correlation among different feature categories along the channel dimensionality. By adding the two-level extracted contextual information element-by-element, the explicit fine-grained contexts can be learnt to produce more precise predictions for hepatic tumor segmentation, especially for small tumors. Moreover, with the guidance of the learned multi-scale contextual dependencies, the false-positive results are also significantly reduced, which is quite important for early cancer detection due to the existence of small lesions or tumor regions in the early stages. Furthermore, the interpretability of the proposed networks has also been greatly improved for hepatic tumor segmentation. Fig. 1 . A test example with our segmentation result and internal learned feature visualization comparison before and after using our multi-scale contextual dependency framework. Several feature map pairs corresponding to two scale contextual operations are respectively given and each learned feature map is enlarged for clarity.

By explicitly passing similar local contexts regardless of positional distances like in an undirected graph operation, the correlation and interaction of contextual dependencies from both the spatial and the channel dimensions is explicitly propagated and encoded into subsequent feature maps. Moreover, the characteristics of small-size tumor/lesion regions can also be inferred better after they are perfectly contextualized by utilizing this multi-scale contextual design, which noticeably reduces false positive cases as well as giving clear boundary predictions. In order to take the full advantage of its effectiveness, the proposed multi-scale context framework is fused into a new U-shape context encoder network, which gives a significant improvement for the backbone and its variants, and really differentiates them in the aspect of context aggregation. Moreover, our proposed multi-scale framework requires a very few additional parameters, which only increases by 0.37% over that of the backbone networks. Experimental results show that our proposed multi-scale framework performs better than the state-of-the-art methods for medical tumor segmentation.

However, the 3D channel context information is essential to extract robust hepatic tumor knowledge. Therefore, this subsection discusses the extraction of channel contextual information. Different channel feature maps usually represent different image feature types and semantic information. Furthermore, semantic information from different channels are usually associated with each other, which can improve the representative capability of feature maps if we exploit them in global knowledge. So, in order to explicitly model the interdependencies between the channel maps, we respectively build a channel context extractor for each contextual information aggregation block from our proposed multi-scale fine-grained context extraction framework. As illustrated in Fig. 3 (2), a light channel context model is utilized to achieve fewer parameters in the process. When the input original feature maps X \u2208 R 28\u00d728\u00d7256 are fed into the spatial context extractor, we also deliver them into the channel context extractor in the meantime. Different from the former step, X is directly reshaped into Q, K , F \u2208 R (28\u00b728)\u00d7256 without any convolutional operation. Besides, V = {v i } i=1:C is the channel set for each channel contextual feature v i \u2208 R 28\u00b728 at the third dimension. Then, we perform a matrix multiplication between the transposed Q t and K to calculate the channel similarity of any two channel maps over all the spatial positions. Later, the generated channel context map M is applied by a softmax layer to normalize them for satisfying the properties of probability. In addition, the global contextual dependency extraction X for each channel map is obtained by a matrix multiplication along the channel dimension. To this end, the following equations are used.",

The pioneering U-shape network, U-Net [7] can be used to predict hepatic tumor regions on CT slices but with an unsatisfactory performance (e.g., 73.62% in Dice) as well as its variant Nested UNet [12] (e.g., 73.58% in Dice), while the attention based variant Attention UNet [9] is better by around 5% than the original U-Net under different segmentation criteria. This is because Attention UNet can give a further refinement for learned features from the spatial dimension to highlight the salient features and suppress useless ones. Similarly, SENet [15] also improves the segmentation performance by embedding squeeze-and-excitation blocks after skip connections as a channel attention mechanism, in spite of a slight decline compared to Attention UNet. Then, we compare popular context based models for medical tumor segmentation. R2U-Net [11] only outperforms its backbone model (U-Net) by about 1% in segmentation accuracies by employing RNNs and residual connections to extract feature context features. By contrast, multi-kernel context encoder networks CE-Net [13] can achieve relatively better performance (such as 78.41% in Dice, 33.78 pixels in HD, 72.92% in Precision and 89.33% in Recall) with different evaluation measures like Attention UNet [9] , where pretrained network parameters can also provide some help in improving segmentation performance together with multiple kernel contextual feature extraction. For comparison with recent self-attention and non-local models [8, 10] , we have integrated their original spatial context extraction module into our backbone networks in lieu of ours. As we can see from Table 1 , the Self-attention model [8, 10] drops two percentage points over multi-kernel context encoder networks [13] . Very recently, both DANet [17] and CS-Net [18] have exploited two types of self-attention models acting on the top of a feature encoder path from different pretrained network architectures with better performance than Attention UNet [9] and CE-Net [13] , for example, 79.97% vs 78.90% in Dice, 30.94 pixels vs 32.90 pixels in HD, 74.50% vs 73.03% in Precision and 90.38% vs 90.03% in Recall.

In addition, the true positive rate (TPR, also Recall coefficient) from our method is also significantly better with an average 2.49%. While Specificity coefficient with 0.058% increase, also called true negative rate (TNR), is also slightly better than all the other methods due to a small percentage of tumor regions in CT slices; F1 score of our model noticeably outperforms all the baseline methods by an average of 4.46% by leveraging Precision and Recall results. Last but not the least, our multi-scale context aggregation method exhibits an average reduction in Hausdorff distance of 9.79 pixels, which means that the boundaries from our segmentation results can better coincide with their corresponding ground truths from radiologists than those of the nine state-of-the-art methods. Overall, our proposed segmentation method can outperform those nine state-of-the-art segmentation methods because our multi-scale context guided information aggregation process can better encode global knowledge into local features with fine-grained representations from spatial and channel dimensions and other important modules in our networks also boost segmentation performance of our framework.",

Both our proposed method and DANet [17] perform well on the first sample, but others falsely consider healthy regions as hepatic tumors. This is similar in the second sample, except that Attention UNet [9] also works well. However, from the third sample, we see that DANet [17] has difficulty to differentiate hepatic tumors from surrounding tissues. As a whole, in cases Fig. 4(3-5) , the false positive rates of the state-of-the-art methods are really high, resulting in many mis-segmented regions. This would negatively affect an accurate diagnosis for patients with hepatopathy, especially for early stage patients. On the other hand, in the sixth sample, the compared models just give partial predictions for tumor regions with some undiagnosed cases, which means a high false negative rate from their models. More importantly, in some challenging cases (e.g., Fig. 4(7) ), all the baseline methods completely fail. Overall, all these misdiagnoses generated from the state-ofthe-art automatic segmentation methods could be due to a lack of effective context extraction for accurate hepatic tumor segmentation. By contrast, our proposed multiscale segmentation framework can extract fine-grained global context dependencies from spatial and channel dimensions and then aggregate them together with local features to generate more precise segmentation results, as depicted in Fig. 4.   Fig. 4 . Seven randomly selected samples with their segmentation results from the state-of-the-art methods. For clarity, we only report the regions of interest (ROI) of some of the compared methods due to space limitations.",

In particular, we have modeled the semantic context dependencies over all the local features from both the spatial and channel dimensions. To be specific, the spatial contextual relationship can aggregate tumor features at each spatial location by summing a global dependency on all related tumor features, which can lessen the effect of the position distance of local features in feature maps. On the other hand, a global interdependent channel affinity map is also computed to emphasize the correlation among different feature categories along the channel dimensionality. In addition, feature visualization analysis and comparison significantly improves the interpretability of our proposed automatic segmentation networks. Extensive experiments conducted on a real-life liver tumor dataset also demonstrate that our model outperforms nine compared state-of-the-art segmentation methods. In the future, we plan to extend this framework into further clinical applications.",
