The source natural history and clinical trials are detailed Methods. Initially, we newly analyzed swab specimens from unique persons by NGS (ref. 13, Genbank KX574860 through KX574908). After observing evidence of HSV-1 \u00d7 HSV-2 IRV and confirmation by manual sequencing (below), we newly obtained UL39 genotyping data from 111 other persons (Table 1). The criteria for additional specimen selection was to increase coverage to about 50 persons each in North and South American and Africa, and to maintain sex and HIV co-infection status distribution within geographic areas. Persons with HIV co-infection were relatively underrepresented in the US compared to South American and Africa. We used digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) (Supporting Information Methods) to genotype additional specimens. ddPCR was validated with specimens pre-sequenced by NGS and/or Sanger methods. The absolute fluorescence intensities for HSV-1 and HSV-2 genotypes varied between runs, but inclusion of samples with known genotypes in each ddPCR run permitted genotype assignment (examples, SI Fig. 1). One or both UL39 ddPCR assays failed for 9% of genital swab DNA specimens, correlating with low amounts of HSV-2 DNA in a quantitative PCR test. Overall, we obtained unambiguous UL39 genotyping data from 152 (91%) of 167 persons on whom it was attempted.",

Across the entire gene, the larger of the two major branches (SI Fig. 2) contained HSV-2 SD90e and laboratory strain 186. These data support the recent suggestion1518 to use SD90e as the prototype HSV-2 strain, rather than strain HG52 (see below), and we named the largest UL39 group SD90e/186. We did use strain 186 rather than SD90e for recombination analyses herein, because strain SD90e has a very rare 9 nucleotide deletion in UL39 (above), while overall 81/85 strains (95%), including strain 186 had the same, prevalent length for UL39. Laboratory strain HG52 clearly fell in the minor UL39 branch. HSV-1 and ChHV segregated outside of these major HSV-2 groups, with ChHV closer to HSV-2 than HSV-1 from HSV-2. Aside from low prevalence SNPs and short indels, we noticed that the prevalent differences between UL39 sequences were concentrated in the 3\u2032 region of the ORF. We therefore re-analyzed from base pair (bp) 950 to the stop codon (Fig. 1) to focus on the divergent region. To simplify, we present data for the 26 HSV-2 unique sequences in this region, excluding identical sequences. The HSV-2 SD90e/186 group was again the largest. The minor group now resolved more clearly into two subgroups. One subgroup, designated HG52, included 8 of 85 strains (9.4% of total). The second subgroup contained 15 of 85 (17.6%) sequences and was designated G19080 (SI Table 1) after a representative member. G19080 was isolated from a 45 year old HIV-1 co-infected US woman (Genbank KR13530814). Notably, both the HG52 and G19080 HSV-2 subgroups segregated with HSV-1, while ChHV again segregated separately.",

The three phylogenetic trees based on the recombinant fragment and the two flanking regions clearly demonstrated a shift in topology, where the recombinant HSV-2 strain 19080 clustered closely to HSV-1 in the tree representing the recombinant fragment, while clustering closely to the HSV-2 strain 186 in the flanking regions (Fig. 3). The high similarity between the HSV-2 strain 19080 and HSV-1 in the recombinant fragment was also shown by Simplot analysis. Similar results for a shorter recombinant fragment were observed for HSV-2 strain HG52 (Fig. 3). The phi-statistics for the presence of recombination had p-values of 0.0 for both HSV-2 strains G19080 and HG52, and the algorithms implemented in RDP419 (i.e. RDP, GENECONV, bootScan, MaxChi, Chimaera, and SiScan) all yielded p-values supporting recombination (ranging from 2.7 \u00d7 10\u221271 to 3.2 \u00d7 10\u221213, and from 2.0 \u00d7 10\u221241 to 2.0 \u00d7 10\u221207 for G19080 and HG52, respectively).

We aligned full length UL30 from HSV-1 (n = 98), ChHV22, HSV-2v, HSV-2 NGS sequences13141516, laboratory strains, and HSV-2 sequences in Genbank. HSV-1 UL30 were closely related, with maximum pairwise uncorrected nucleotide distance of 0.01 and little C-terminal variation. HSV-1 17+ and HSV-2 186 were chosen as the species genotypes for recombination analyses for consistency with our analyses of UL39. For both UL30 and UL29, strains 186 and the proposed prototype strain SD90e were extremely similar. We noted that most HSV-2 UL30 sequences have a 539 bp zone of identity to HSV-1 (Table 2, Fig. 4C). This zone contains over 70 consecutive HSV-1-specific allelic SNPs and an HSV-1-specific 12 bp insert. Lateral to this zone, all HSV-2 UL30 genes, including HSV-2v, are similar, and quite dissimilar from HSV-1 (Fig. 4D). Contravening the ChHV hypothesis, many SNPs and a 3 bp indel in the 539 bp region separate HSV-2v from ChHV. Bootscan (Fig. 4D) confirmed a HSV-1 \u00d7 HSV-2 crossover event with highly shifting bootstrap values supporting different phylogenetic topologies. Simplot analysis further supported recombination by significant shifts in sequence similarity. Phylogenetic analyses of discrete regions of UL30 demarcated by the putative crossover zones associated with the tree clustering patterns (Fig. 4D). The phi-statistics (p = 0.0) and RDP4 algorithms demonstrated high significance for recombination (p < 7.6 \u00d7 10\u221218 for all methods). Most contemporary HSV-2, exemplified by strains SD90e and 186, have an HSV-1 UL30 insert. We hypothesize that UL30 HSV-2v may retain an older sequence related to ChHV.",

HSV-1 UL29 sequences (n = 81) were very similar, with a maximum nucleotide distance of 0.0097 and no indels. Alignments of HSV-2 UL29 disclosed one divergent sequence, 2009_4556, from a 30 year old HIV-infected Kenyan (Fig. 4A). Phylogenetic analyses (Fig. 4B) paralleled UL30. Between bp 2186 and bp 2439, HSV-2 186 and SD90e, and other HSV-2 strains show near-identity to HSV-1, including 19 consecutive HSV-1-like alleles. This 254 bp segment placed HSV-1 in the same group as the majority HSV-2 genotype (Fig. 4B). This single unique strain contained 10 differences from ChHV in this region, arguing against origination through recombination with ChHV. Lateral to this region, all HSV-2 were similar but not identical to ChHV and quite divergent from HSV-1. Similar to UL39 and UL30, the bootscan, Simplot, and segmental phylogenetic analyses of UL29 showed distinct shifts in phylogenetic topologies and sequence similarity, consistent with HSV-1 \u00d7 HSV-2 recombination. Recombination was statistically supported by the phi-statistics (p = 4.4 \u00d7 10\u221210) and the RDP4 program (p < 5.9 \u00d7 10\u22126 for all methods except RDP, which did not detect recombination). We propose that an ancestral HSV-1 \u00d7 HSV-2 UL29 crossover has become near-fixed in HSV-2, with 2009_4556 as the only currently known strain perhaps retaining an ancestral sequence.",

Attenuated HSV-2 strains29 used as vaccines are also of potential concern. These could recombine with HSV-1 to yield replication-competent variants with unexpected properties. Similarly, a replication competent HSV-1 strain expressing GM-CSF is US-licensed for intratumoral injection as oncolytic therapy, at up to 4 \u00d7 108 infectious units. Recurrent HSV-2 replication can occur at widespread anatomic areas, including within the central nervous system to cause recurrent meningitis30. The possibility of recombinants bearing HSV-2 virulence and replication genes and GM-CSF may be possible has been previously discussed31. There is no reason to think that gain of GM-CSF by a wild-type HSV-2 strain would be lead to a selective advantage or increase pathogenicity. Of potentially higher concern, some of the genes deleted in the cancer therapy HSV-1 strain to reduce virulence could be regained, as their HSV-2 versions, via interspecies recombination.",

A recent estimate places human/chimp divergence at 13 million years ago45. We cannot date the HSV-2 \u00d7 HSV-1 recombination events, but based on the relatively equal geographic distribution of the major UL39 variants, each appears to predate human emigration from Africa (now estimated at about 70,000 years ago46). Recent horizontal transmission of UL39 variants is also possible. Resolution will require larger, curated specimen sets including those from isolated populations, and optimally archival DNA from before the era of widespread travel. In preliminary analyses of phylogenetic networks, we studied the HSV-1 UL39 insert found in HSV-2 strain G19080 and the corresponding region from known HSV-1 strains. No clustering into clades was observed as seen for HSV-1 US7 or US8. Interestingly, the HSV-2 strain 19080 UL39 HSV-1 fragment does not cluster more distantly or closely to any particular HSV-1 strain than do HSV-1 strains cluster with each other. This implies that the HSV-1 UL39 fragment in HSV-2 G19080 was incorporated into this strain through homologous recombination after emergence of the most recent common ancestor of circulating HSV-1 strains, estimated to have occurred 700,000 years ago4.",

It is possible that the recombination points that flank the HSV-1 insert within the HSV-2 G19080 group arose multiple times due to strong site preferences for recombination. Sequence bias for HSV IRV formation has been noted in vitro3, but the mechanism is unknown. In this earlier work, crossovers were noted near UL39 but not mapped precisely. The HSV origin of replication in the HSV unique long (UL) region is between UL29 and UL30, but it is not known if this is related to IRV formation. A correlation was found between high GC content and intratypic recombination for HSV-147. HSV-1 UL29, UL30, and UL39 GC content very near the average of 66.8% for HSV-1 UL, disfavoring GC content as an explanation. Overall, we consider multiple, independent crossover events less likely than persistence of a relatively ancient recombinant G19080 UL39 variant in the human population as well as the persistence of the progeny of occasional back-crosses to HSV-2.",

We used a relatively limited set of HSV-2 sequences to detect IRV. Additional full-length HSV-2 sequences including specimens from other continents will likely identify other sites of recombination. Of special interest are detailed studies of specimens from persons with both HSV-1 and HSV-2 infections at the same anatomic site, which might reveal additional and possibly transitory IRV. Our cross-sectional specimen set likely failed to detect some interspecies recombination events that have occurred in the past due to decay of IRV with a fitness disadvantage, and similarly, the temporal sequence of events leading to the variants circulating today cannot be assigned with certainty. Long term, IRV with fitness advantages could reach 100% prevalence, appear as tracts of HSV-1/HSV-2 identity, and again be undetectable without longitudinal samples. The effects of the recombination events detected in this study can be tested in vitro or in animals, but it will be difficult to prove their effects on virulence in the natural host.",

As discussed herein, we elected to use strain 186 as the representative of the most abundant UL39 genotype for our formal recombination analyses, as strain SD90e contains a rare 9 basepair deletion in UL39. Otherwise, the sequences of 186 and SD90e are very similar for the three genes in which we detected interspecies recombination and overall, our data partially support SD90e as an HSV-2 prototype. The selection of a HSV-2 strain as genotypic prototype is complex. Strains 333 and SD90e are identical in the C terminal region of UL39, but the 9 basepair deletion seen in SD90e is not present in 333. We propose that SD90e is a better rational candidate for prototype strain given the fact that 333 is highly passaged and has not been compared head to head with other strains for virulence or protection after administration of candidate vaccines, as has SD90e18. For HSV-1, the use of HSV-1 17+ for analyses of UL29, UL30, and UL39 is reasonable as there is no consensus as to prototype strain. For the three HSV genes in this report, strain 17+ is closely representative of every HSV-1 sequence data available in Genbank, including those recently analyzed by Szpara et al.353650 and of any other HSV-1 strain would have no bearing on the conclusions of this study. This area will likely undergo further refinement as additional sequences and analyses become available.",

These genes are pivotal in HSV pathogenesis. Briefly, UL39 is non-essential in vitro but required for virulence in vivo, while UL29 and UL30 are essential regardless. UL39 variants could influence dNTP pools and neuronal reactivation, as UL39 is required for replication in neurons with low endogenous dNTP levels. Additional UL39 functions include an N-terminal RHIM domain that inhibits necroptosis51, a possible protein kinase52, and a C-terminal region has been implicated in inhibition of apoptosis. The UL29 ssDNA binding protein is involved in DNA unwinding and origin of replication processes, interacting with multiple cellular and viral proteins. The UL30 DNA polymerase has a proofreading exonunclease function and cooperates with the UL42 processivity factor; mutations can lead to mutator phenotypes and altered drug sensitivity. The variant proteins uncovered herein can be studied biochemically, in vitro, or in vivo in the isogenic virus context. Within the immunocompetent population there is enormous person-to-person variation in the frequency of HSV-2 symptomatic recurrence and asymptomatic shedding53. Quantitative study of reactivation parameters in persons with prevalent IRV genotypes might reveal phenotypic-genotpye correlations.",
