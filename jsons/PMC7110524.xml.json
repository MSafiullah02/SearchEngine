In what became known as the 20/80 rule, a concept documented by observational and modeling studies and having profound implications for infection control, 20% of the individuals within any given population are thought to contribute at least 80% to the transmission potential of a pathogen,2 and many host\u2013pathogen interactions were found to follow this empirical rule.",

In 1992, 41 of the 97 contacts of an index person with cavitary tuberculosis from a Minnesota bar tested positive, and 14 (14%) developed active tuberculosis, despite the fact that only 1\u20132% of infectious patients\u2019 close contacts normally develop tuberculosis.7 This super-spreader alone contributed with 35% of all new active tuberculosis cases from Minneapolis during 1992. In July 1998, a 9-year-old child from North Dakota, whose female guardian had been diagnosed with extrapulmonary tuberculosis, was found to have bilateral cavitary infection, and 56 (20%) of his school contacts had a positive tuberculin skin test and were presumed infected. Nevertheless, his twin brother had a mild case and was not infectious.8 This is even more remarkable, considering that children with tuberculosis have few bacilli in their lesions, often do not produce sputum, and rarely have communicable disease.9, 10, 11 In 1989, at a high school in Finland, one student infected 22 others with measles, even though eight of the contacts were vaccinated, one of them twice,12 and during the 1995 Ebola hemorrhagic fever outbreak from Kikwit, the Democratic Republic of the Congo,13 two individuals, both exhibiting gastrointestinal hemorrhage, probably represented the source of infection for over 50 secondary cases. Several studies found increased urethral HIV shedding in individuals co-infected with other sexually transmitted pathogens; for example, an eight-fold higher HIV shedding was reported in men with urethritis as compared to men without urethritis having similar circulatory viral burdens, and in men with gonorrhea, HIV shedding decreased subsequent to antibiotic treatment.14, 15, 16 A heterosexual man co-infected with HIV, hepatitis C virus, and herpes simplex 2 virus had unusually high semen HIV RNA levels, which exceeded plasma levels by one order of magnitude, and were explained by recurrent asymptomatic herpes infections.17 Maternal herpes virus infection was associated with increased perinatal and intrapartum HIV transmission,18, 19 and herpes virus suppressive therapy was shown to reduce HIV shedding in dually infected women.20\n",

During the 2002\u20132003 SARS outbreaks, not all patients harboring the virus were equally infectious. The majority had very low infectivity, and super-spreading events represented one of the most particular features of this outbreak.21 A stochastic model that analyzed 1512 patients from the first 10 weeks of the Hong Kong SARS pandemic22 showed that the virus was moderately transmissible, with 2.7 secondary infections for every index case, when excluding super-spreading events. A similar modeling of the Singapore outbreak23 revealed that in a fully susceptible population that has not yet implemented infection control, an individual would infect approximately three secondary contacts. In fact, among the first 201 probable SARS patients in Singapore, 81% had no evidence of infecting others, but five individuals infected 10 or more secondary contacts each.23, 24 By using mathematical and statistical analyses, Li et al. found that approximately 71% and 75% of the infections from Hong Kong and Singapore, respectively, were attributable to super-spreader events, and suggested that delaying hospital admission more than 4 days after the onset of symptoms could partly be responsible for super-spreading events, underscoring the importance of early diagnosis and isolation.21\n",

On April 17, the patient was transferred to the Tianjin Thorax Disease Hospital and received treatment for two days, and on April 19 he was again transferred to the Tianjin Infectious Disease Hospital, where he died.

As a result, when water flowed down, the backflow from the risers was able to generate aerosols and spread pathogens into individual bathrooms. In addition, powerful window fans installed by residents in many bathrooms created a significant negative pressure that amplified the aerosol backflow. In the Amoy Gardens complex outbreak, 329 individuals were infected and 42 died.32 The cases occurred in clusters, at specific floor levels, in a pattern that simple person-to-person transmission could not explain, and an epidemiological investigation proposed, as a plausible explanation, a common source of exposure for all infected individuals.33 Approximately 45% of the infections occurred in Block E, the same block that the index patient visited, and approximately 60% were within flats 7 and 8, bordering the specific vertical riser thought to be involved. An investigation found that the index patient had very high concentrations of virus in the urine and feces, and proposed that aerosolization as a result of the hydraulic effect inside drainage pipes facilitated the spread of the pathogen.32 This outbreak revealed the importance of taking indoor air quality and building ventilation into account when exploring the dynamics of airborne pathogens. It was, in addition, suggested that in certain individuals, immune system defects could increase the viral load and make them become super-spreaders, as could have happened with the index patient who was undergoing hemodialysis, which is known to impair both innate and adaptive immunity.27, 34\n",

Capparelli and collaborators36 examined water buffaloes from an area in Italy endemic for brucellosis, and found that while most infected animals shed Brucella abortus at low levels in their milk, a few animals shed large numbers of bacteria. Kilpatrick et al.37 showed that mosquitoes infected with West Nile virus feed on American robins (Turdus migratorius), a species that represented 4% of the avian abundance, approximately 17 times more frequently than expected by chance, revealing strong heterogeneities that exist in the transmission of this pathogen. In a study that examined Sin Nombre Virus transmission among deer mice, which usually requires direct contact such as biting or scratching, Clay et al. described significant heterogeneities in the contact frequency and contact length between hosts, and showed that a small percentage of animals controls most transmission events.38 A cross-sectional survey conducted on 474 Scottish cattle farms by Matthews et al.39 unveiled marked differences in infectiousness, with approximately 20% of the most infectious animals being responsible for approximately 80% of the transmission, and showed that interventions targeted to the 5% most infectious individuals could reduce R\n0 to values lower than 1. Fecal sample analysis conducted at a UK abattoir revealed that approximately 9% of the cattle examined over a 9-week period were high Escherichia coli O157 shedders (>104 CFU/g) and they accounted for over 96% of the bacteria shed by all animals tested,40 and a survey of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium fecal shedding by mice identified a subset of animals that shed high numbers of bacteria (>108 CFU/g), a phenotype linked to the presence of two bacterial virulence determinants, the SPI1 and SPI2 pathogenicity islands.41\n",

It was subsequently revealed that during each of the two outbreaks, she had an upper respiratory tract infection, and phage typing confirmed the identity between the strain she was colonized with and the ones causing the outbreaks.46 A physician colonized intranasally with S. aureus exhibited a 40-fold increased airborne dispersal after acquiring an upper respiratory rhinovirus infection, becoming thus a \u2018cloud adult\u2019,47 and a study that examined volunteers with S. aureus nasal carriage revealed, on average, a two-fold increase in bacterial dispersion into the air after rhinovirus infection, with up to 34-fold higher dispersion observed in one volunteer.48 This process is mechanistically insufficiently understood, and one scenario that was proposed is that rhinovirus-induced swelling of the nasal turbinates could create a high-speed airflow that establishes aerosols.47\n",

As it is apparent from the examples presented above, each outbreak offers specific insights into factors that might shape super-spreading events. It is imperative to explore all facets of host and pathogen biology, as well as environmental factors that might shape their interaction, and analyze the observations provided by previous outbreaks (Table 1\n).
