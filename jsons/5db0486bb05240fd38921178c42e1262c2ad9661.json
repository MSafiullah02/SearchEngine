As the crisis of its serious increasing dynamic outbreak in all parts of the globe, the forecast maps and analysis of confirmed cases (CS) becomes a vital great changeling task. In this study, a new forecasting model is presented to analyze and forecast the CS of COVID-19 for the coming days based on the reported data since 22 Jan 2020. The proposed forecasting model, named ISACL-MFNN, integrates an improved interior search algorithm (ISA) based on chaotic learning (CL) strategy into a multi-layer feed-forward neural network (MFNN). The ISACL incorporates the CL strategy to enhance the performance of ISA and avoid the trapping in the local optima. By this methodology, it is intended to train the neural network by tuning its parameters to optimal values and thus achieving high-accuracy level regarding forecasted results. The ISACL-MFNN model is investigated on the official data of the COVID-19 reported by the World Health Organization (WHO) to analyze the confirmed cases for the upcoming days. The performance regarding the proposed forecasting model is validated and assessed by introducing some indices including the mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and the comparisons with other optimization algorithms are presented.",

Despite the drastic containment measures taken by governments associated with different countries, it is swiftly spread to hit different parts of several countries. Besides China presents the mainland for the outbreak for this epidemic, the USA found itself at the top country with the worst outbreak for this epidemic. The exponential daily increase in the infected people, some governments implements a decree to lockdown entire parts of the country.

            "text": "Recently some efforts have been presented to address the COVID-19. Zhao et al. [2] developed some statistical analysis based on the Poisson concept to expect the real number of COVID-19 cases that had not been reported in the first half of January 2020. They estimated that the unreported cases reach 469 from 1 to 15 January 2020 and those after 17 January 2020 had increased 21-fold. Nishiura et al. [3] presented a statistical estimation model to determine the infection rate regarding the COVID-19 on 565 Japanese citizens (i.e., from 29 to 31 January 2020) which are evacuated from Wuhan, China, on three chartered flights. They estimate the infection rate which is 9.5% and the rate for death which is 0.3% to 0.6%. Tang et al. [4] developed a likelihood-based estimation model to estimate the risk of transmission regarding COVID-19. They concluded the reproduction number can be effectively reduced by the isolation and avoiding the intensive contact tracing. In [5] , the transmission risk of COVID-19 through human-to-human is studied on 47 patients. Duccio Fanelli et al. [6] develop a differential equations model to analyze the exponential growth of the COVID-19 on three countries including China, Italy, and France in the time window from 22 / 01 to 15 / 03 / 2020. Accordingly, the literature involves some models that were developed for forecasting some epidemics. These models include the compartmental model proposed by De. Felice et al. [7] to forecast transmission and spillover risk of the human West Nile (WN) virus. They applied their model on the historical data reported from the mainland of this virus, Long Island, New York, form 2001 to 2014. In [8] , forecasting pattern via time series models based on time-delay neural networks, multi-layer perceptron (MLP), auto-regressive, and radial basis function, is proposed to gauge and forecast the hepatitis A virus infection, where these models are investigated on thirteen years of reported data from Turkey country. They affirmed that the MLP outcomes the other models. In [9] , a forecasting model using an ensemble adjustment Kalman filter is developed to address the outbreaks of seasonal influenza, where they are employed the seasonal data of New York City from 2003 to 2008. In [10] , a dynamic model based on the Bayesian inference concept is presented to forecast the outbreaks of Ebola in some African countries including Liberia, Guinea, and Sierra Leone. Massad et al. [11] developed a mathematical model to forecast and analyze the SARS epidemic while Ong et al. [12] presented a forecasting model for influenza A (H1N1-2009). Moreover, a probability-based model is proposed by Nah et al. [13] to predict the spreading of the MERS. The feed-forward neural network (FNN) [14] presents one of the most commonly used artificial neural networks (ANNs) that has been applied in a wide range of forecasting applications with a high level of accuracy. The FNN possesses some distinguishing features that it makes valuable and attractive for forecasting problems. The first feature is a data-driven self-adaptive technique with few prior assumptions about the model. The second is that it can generalize. The third is that a universal functional approximation that provides a high degree of performance while approximating a large class of functions. Finally, it possesses nonlinear features. Due to these advantages of FNN, it has drawn overwhelming attention in several felids of prediction or forecasting tasks. For example, FNN was presented with two layers for approximating functions [14] . Isa et al. [15] presented the FNN based on multilayer perception (MLP) that is conducted on the data set from the University of California Irvine (UCI) repository. Lin . Although many related studies seem to be elegant for the forecasting tasks, they may deteriorate the diversity of solutions and may get trapped in local optima. Furthermore, these methods may be problem-dependent. Therefore these limitations can deteriorate the performance of the forecasting output and may achieve the unsatisfactory and imprecise quality of the final outcomes. This motivated us to presents a promising alternative model for forecasting tasks with the aim to achieve more accurate outcomes and avoid the previous limitations by integrating the strengths of a chaotic-based parallelization scheme and interior search method to attain better results.",

            "text": "Interior Search Algorithm (ISA) is a novel meta-heuristic algorithm that is presented based on the beautification of objects and mirrors. It was proposed by Gandomi 2014 [33] for solving global optimization problems. It contains two groups, namely mirror and composition to attain optimum placement of the mirrors and the objects for a more attractive view. The prominent feature of ISA is contained in involving only one control parameter. ISA has been applied to solving many engineering optimization fields [34, 35, 36, 37, 38] . However, ISA may face the dilemma of the sucking in the local optimum while implemented for complicated and/or high dimensional optimization problems. Therefore, to alleviate these shortages, ISA needs more improvement strategies to acquire great impacts on its performance. In this paper, an improved interior search algorithm (ISA) based on chaotic learning (CL), a strategy named ISACL is proposed. The ISACL is started with the historical COVID-19 dataset, and then this dataset is sent to the MFNN model to perform the configuration process based on parameters of the weight and biases. In this context, the ISACL is invoked to improve these parameters as the solutions by starting with ISA to explore the search space and CL strategy to enhance the local exploitation capabilities. By this methodology, it is intended to enhance the quality and alleviate the falling in local optima. The quality of solutions is assessed according to the fitness value. The process of algorithm is continued for updating the solutions (parameters) iteratively until the stop condition is reached, and then the achieved best parameters are invoked for configuring the structure of the MFNN model to perform the forecasting and analyzing the number of confirmed cases of COVID-19.

[18] proposed the FNN to obtain the optimum solution of the approximation function. In [19,20] the back-propagation (BP) method has been employed as a training technique for FNN. However, these methods perceive some limitations such as falling in a local minimum and slow convergence. To alleviate these limitations, many researchers proposed a combination of meta-heuristic algorithms to improve the performance and the utility of an FNN. In this context, Zhang et al. [21] developed a combined particle swarm optimization (PSO) based on the BP method. Bohat et al. [22] proposed the gravitational search algorithm (GSA) and PSO for training an FNN while Mirjalili et al. [23] introduced a combination of the PSO and GSA to optimize the FNN, where they introduced an acceleration coefficient in GSA to improve the performance of the overall algorithm. .Si et al. [24] developed a differential evolution (DE)based method to search for the optimal values of the synaptic weight coefficients of the ANN. Shaw and Kinsner [25] presented the simulated annealing (SA) based on a chaotic strategy to train FNN, to mitigate the possibility of sticking in the local optima, but this algorithm suffered from the slow convergence [26]. Furthermore, Karraboga [27] presented the artificial bee colony (ABC) for training FNN, where it suffers from local exploitation. Irani and Nasimi [28] proposed ant colony optimization (ACO) to optimize the weight vector of the FNN, where it deteriorates the global search. Apart from the previously proposed approaches based on FNN, the literature is very rich with many recent optimization models that have employed for training tasks [29, 30, 31, 32]",
