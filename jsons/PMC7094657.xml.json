            "text": "Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) is a novel zoonotic lineage C Beta-coronavirus that was first identified in 2012 in Saudi Arabia (Zaki et al., 2012). This virus causes disease ranging from asymptomatic infections to mild or severe respiratory disease which is usually followed by multi-organs failure and death in the elderly and individuals with comorbidities. As of April 2018, MERS-CoV has caused up to 2220 laboratory-confirmed cases in 27 countries with 35.6% fatality rate (790 deaths) (WHO, 2018). Most index MERS patients from non-endemic regions have had a travel history to the Middle East (de Groot et al., 2013). So far, Saudi Arabia has reported 1844 cases (~83.1% of total) with 716 deaths (~38.8% local death rate) (WHO, 2018). Current evidence suggests that MERS is a zoonotic infection most likely from dromedary camels (Alagaili et al., 2014; Azhar et al., 2014) which is usually followed by limited human-to-human spread and outbreaks in healthcare or household settings. One large cross-sectional study from Saudi Arabia suggested low seroprevalence of <0.15% of MERS-CoV in the general population compared to 2.3% and 3.6% in high-risk groups such as shepherds and slaughterhouse workers, respectively (M\u00fcller et al., 2015).",

            "text": "Several MERS-CoV serological assays have been developed and utilized in epidemiological and surveillance studies especially in endemic regions. Serological detection of MERS-CoV antibodies (Abs) in patients is based on screening by indirect ELISA using MERS-CoV nucleocapsid (N) protein and confirmation by immunofluorescence assay (IFA) of MERS-CoV infected cells and/or microneutralization (MN) assay (Al-Abdallat et al., 2014). Indirect ELISA based on recombinant MERS-spike (S) ectodomain protein (amino acids 1\u20131297) was recently included in this algorithm (Trivedi et al., 2017). Other groups have also used several other assays such as S protein microarray, IFA staining based on cells expressing recombinant full length S protein, plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT), MERS-CoV pseudoparticle neutralization (ppNT) assay, and indirect ELISA based on S1 recombinant protein (Perera et al., 2013; Reusken et al., 2013; Zhao et al., 2013; Hemida et al., 2014; Meyer et al., 2014; Fukuma et al., 2015; Grehan et al., 2015; M\u00fcller et al., 2015; Muth et al., 2015; Park et al., 2015; Chan et al., 2017). More recently, S-based competitive ELISA (cELISA) based on neutralizing monoclonal Abs (mAbs) have been developed and shown to correlate well with neutralization assays with high sensitivity and specificity (Fukushi et al., 2017).",

For example, gold standard neutralization methods such as MN and PRNT require high containment laboratories which are limited or not available in endemic regions. Furthermore, protein microarray, cELISA, IFA and ppNT require expensive and special equipment and reagents, and/or highly trained technical staff which represent a technical hurdle for most laboratories in the Middle East. On the other hand, indirect ELISA is simple, rapid, cheap, and does not require high containment facilities making it a suitable choice especially in resource-limited regions. However, there is a limited number of reports testing human clinical samples mainly due to the lack of well-characterized human sera. Therefore, the goal of this study was to develop, validate and compare in house developed indirect ELISAs for the detection of MERS-CoV Abs based on recombinant N, S1 and S proteins using a large number of well characterized human serum samples.",

As shown in Fig. 4\n, the sensitivity of both rS1-ELISA and rS-ELISA remained \u226590% across a wide range of OD values (0.00\u20130.4 for rS1-ELISA and 0.00\u20130.48 for S-ELISA), compared to rN-ELISA where sensitivity decreased below 90% when OD value reaches 0.33.

Furthermore, levels of anti-MERS-CoV Abs have been shown to be associated with disease severity and viral loads, suggesting that they could be utilized as prognostic markers for disease outcomes (Poissy et al., 2014; Corman et al., 2016; Choe et al., 2017; Zhao et al., 2017). Current gold standard virus neutralization assays (MN and PRNT) or the alternative ppNT assay are sensitive, specific and have excellent correlation with each other (Park et al., 2015). However, they require skilled personnel working with live virus in high containment laboratories or availability of specialized equipment and continuous source of pseudoviruses in the case of ppNT assay. Other assays such as IFA and protein microarrays are expensive, time-consuming, less sensitive, and require trained technical staff and specialized equipment. These limitations render such assays not suitable for large-scale or high-throughput screening and testing especially in MERS-CoV endemic regions where most of these requirements are limited or not available. Therefore, we aimed to develop, compare and validate different in house ELISAs based on MERS-CoV N, S1 and S recombinant proteins using large number of well characterized human samples to provide cheap and easy tool for serological testing in resource-limited regions.",

            "text": "While we found that rN-ELISA has lower sensitivity compared to both rS1 and rS ELISAs in line with a previous report (Wang et al., 2016), it was recently suggested to have higher sensitivity compared to rS-ELISA across a wide range of OD values (Trivedi et al., 2017). This discrepancy could be explained by the small number of clinical samples especially from high-risk groups used in previous studies which could represent a limiting factor to actually validate these assays. Furthermore, while N protein is more immunogenic and abundant compared to S glycoprotein, and that some patients might have delayed or no development of anti-S Abs (Chen et al., 2015; Trivedi et al., 2017), common antigenic epitopes across the different coronaviruses in N protein could lead to high level of false positivity as we observed in rN-ELISA (Agnihothram et al., 2014; Chen et al., 2015; Trivedi et al., 2017). On the other hand, S1 subunit is associated with less cross-reactivity due higher diversity amongst coronaviruses (Park et al., 2015). In addition, genetically diverse MERS-CoV clades are serologically indistinguishable by neutralization assays which detect nAbs targeting epitopes within the S1 subunit (Hemida et al., 2014; Muth et al., 2015).",

Furthermore, it was recently shown that serological testing by ELISA or MN assay might not capture all exposed or infected individuals as some high-risk individuals could mount virus-specific T cell responses rather than detectable Ab responses (Alshukairi et al., 2016; Alshukairi et al., 2018). It is of note that the 28 false positive samples detected by rS1-ELISA were also positive in rS-ELISA and rN-ELISA, highly suggesting they could be true seropositive samples lacking neutralizing activity. Therefore, we believe future studies are needed to further evaluate these ELISA assays or an ELISA based on pooled antigens in comparison with other methods such as virus-specific T cell response, IFA and neutralization assays.",

Furthermore, several groups have already reported development of ELISA based assays for MERS-CoV, but have primarily used these assays for animal model development or testing of samples from camels or other livestock. In the current report, we developed and evaluated three different ELISA-based assays for MERS-CoV serological testing using large number of characterized clinical samples. These assays were found to have variation in their sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and correlation with MN assay where rS1-ELISA followed by rS-ELISA performed better than rN-ELISA. These developed ELISAs especially those based on rS1 or rS could be used independently or in combination with rN-ELISA in large-scale and high-throughput serological and epidemiological screening as they do not require high containment laboratories and could be adapted by any lab especially that all required reagents are commercially available.",
