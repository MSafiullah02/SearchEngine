Evidence for effectiveness for physical barriers (which include masks to reduce aerosol transmission; handwashing; and gloves and gowns) come from a variety of empirical studies. The chance of bias for these studies is variable, but we can conclude that all of these barrier methods have important potential for preventing transmission of the common cold, although some methods will not be acceptable to the community currently.",

All studies selected cases from hospitals, except one [16] in which the cases were people with probable SARS who reported to the Department of Health in the territory of Hong Kong up to 16 May 2003. There was limited evidence of the superior effectiveness of droplet barrier devices such as the N95 masks (respirators with 95% filtration capability against non-oily particulate aerosols [17] ) over simple surgical masks. There was an incremental effect of decreased respiratory disease burden by adding virucidals or antiseptics to normal handwashing in somewhat atypical settings, but the extra benefit may have been, partly at least, from confounding additional routines.",
