In Hong Kong's public hospitals, health-workers are unable to provide a room for every patient with suspected or probable SARS. Patients diagnosed with SARS may or may not have the SARS virus (es), but they are at risk of contracting the infection if they are grouped with infected patients. Over-diagnosis also leads to inconvenience in the workplace or at school. The case of a young girl who developed fever during her visit to Taiwan is a good example. She had no SARS contact and chest radiograph was normal. However, the Taiwan government labelled her as a suspected SARS case, and she was transported back to Hong Kong where she was declared free from the infection, but the experience for her was not a memorable one.",

The clinical features of many patients are neither severe nor respiratory in nature. SARS was initially labelled as atypical pneumonia with the outbreak in China, and this definition also caused much confusion with the so-called typical atypical pneumonia due to mycoplasma and chlamydia. Also, the acronym SARS is closely similar to that of ARDS for acute respiratory distress syndrome, but has a totally different meaning. Indeed, SARS typically kills patients not via the virus but by complications of ARDS.",

The case definition of suspected SARS is (1) fever, (2) respiratory symptoms including cough and difficulty breathing, and (3) close contact with people with SARS or a history of travel to an epidemic area.1 Probable SARS is a suspected case with radiographic evidence of pneumonia or respiratory distress syndrome. Thus, diagnosis of the cause of SARS was not required in these clinical definitions. However, to not obtain chest radiographs for a patient suspected as having SARS is not practical, neither is it sensible to label a patient as having suspected SARS in the absence of change on chest radiograph. Therefore, to differentiate suspected SARS from probable SARS on the basis of radiographic changes alone is not logical. Furthermore, any child in Hong Kong who has a cold with fever and cough would be diagnosed as suspected SARS by WHO definition. WHO has now revised their definition of a probable case of SARS to include a suspected case of SARS that is positive for SARS coronavirus.",

Suspected SARS, for instance, is now defined as SARS infection that is serious enough that ribavirin is started. The modification is a practical one and partly avoids Overdiagnosis of mild febrile symptoms that are probably not SARS. This modification, however, could lead to underdiagnosis of otherwise mild SARS cases. For example, a teenage girl was identified with symptoms of SARS and chest radiographic changes in accordance with the infection, but no definite history of contact was reported. She was started on ribavirin. Coronavirus was subsequently detected in her throat gargle and stool specimens by reverse transcriptase-PCR. She was labelled as suspected SARS in the absence of contact history. However, WHO would probably judge this case probable SARS because she resides in an epidemic area. If definite contact history is needed, this case is one of coronavirus pneumonia, not SARS at all. We have also seen other cases of SARS without fever and those with diarrhoea but no pneumonia.",

Virological results might also be available a few days after presentation. When we applied this classification to ten children previously reported,2 six could be grouped under EVP [C+, Coronavirus+] and four under EVP [C+, V-].
