The earliest research efforts have focused on understanding the clinical course of COVID-19 and the most effective ways of treating people with severe symptoms or illness. As the pandemic progresses, however, we must also investigate COVID-19's evolving epidemiology and the impact of non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs), such as physical distancing, health messaging, and testing. Researchers and public health practitioners have called for cohort studies to describe the community attack rate, as well as how attack rates are influenced by different approaches to NPI implementation. 1 Internet-based strategies, which facilitate rapid recruitment of large and diverse samples, can be leveraged to understand and inform this swiftly changing and protracted public health crisis. 2, 3 In response to the COVID-19 pandemic the CUNY Institute for Implementation Science in Population Health (ISPH) launched the Communities, Households and SARS/COV-2 Epidemiology (CHASING) COVID Cohort \"C 3 \" study on March 28, 2020 . We sought to recruit an online prospective cohort of 7,500 adults (18 years or older) in the United States (US) and US territories in order to rapidly contribute to our understanding of the spread and impact of the SARS/COV2 pandemic within households and communities. In a prospective cohort study, we will assess the impact of implementing, and relaxing, NPIs on SARS/COV2 clinical outcomes and psychosocial outcomes such as mental health, social support, and interpersonal violence.",

Measures were also developed de novo in response to the novel pandemic. We deployed a second version of the baseline questionnaire on April 9, 2020, which added questions to capture healthcare and other essential worker status.

First, C 3 will be unable to provide representative estimates of prevalence and incidence. Second, we will underestimate hospitalizations and are unable to capture deaths due to COVID or other causes. Most research studies, including ours, deployed in the middle of a pandemic will, by definition, produce some biased estimates since they will not include information on persons who died from COVID, were hospitalized with COVID prior to or during recruitment, or were too sick to participate in a research study at the time of recruitment. From published studies, we will assess bias in our estimates due to these factors and adjust them accordingly. Third, we will be unable to conduct state or county specific analyses, except for a few localities with high participation (e.g., New York and California). Finally, we do not yet know the retention rate or the acceptance rate for specimen collection. However, participants may be more motivated to participate in follow-up, given the active threat and novelty of the COVID-19 pandemic and its ongoing impact on individuals and communities.",
