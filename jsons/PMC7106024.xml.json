            "text": "Canine enteric coronavirus (CECoV) belongs to the genus Alpacoronavirus of the Coronaviridae (Decaro and Buonavoglia, 2011). Field infections are typically associated with mild and self-limiting diarrhoea, (Binn et al., 1974, Decaro and Buonavoglia, 2008, Pratelli, 2005), although there are also reports of more severe haemorrhagic disease with high mortality (Buonavoglia et al., 2006, Evermann et al., 2005, Tennant et al., 1993), sometimes in combination with other pathogens (Evermann et al., 1980, Pratelli et al., 2001, Pratelli et al., 1999b). Both mild and severe disease have been recreated experimentally (Decaro et al., 2008, Decaro et al., 2010a), suggesting the more severe disease phenotype may be associated with the genetic evolution of more virulent strains (Decaro et al., 2008, Evermann et al., 2005). Although CECoV infection is generally considered to be short-lived, occasionally virus shedding has been detected for weeks to months (Decaro et al., 2005, Pratelli et al., 2002, Tennant et al., 1991). The epidemiological significance of these long-term shedders is unknown.",

The strains are named in this way due to their respective homologies to types I and II feline coronavirus (FCoV) (Decaro et al., 2010a, Herrewegh et al., 1998). Genotype II has recently been subdivided into CECoV IIa and CECoV IIb, with the latter thought to have formed via a recombination with transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) (Decaro et al., 2009, Decaro et al., 2010b). There is conflicting evidence on the relative prevalence of CECoV I and II, with some studies suggesting type I is more common (Decaro et al., 2005, Stavisky et al., 2010), and others suggesting type II (Decaro et al., 2011, Soma et al., 2011), but these findings will depend on a number of factors including the nature of the sample population. Dual infection with both types has been reported to occur, both naturally and experimentally (Decaro et al., 2011, Decaro et al., 2005, Soma et al., 2011). There is some evidence to show that type I may be shed at a greater titre than type II CECoV (Decaro et al., 2011, Decaro et al., 2005, Soma et al., 2011).",

In general, CECoV prevalence is lowest in healthy pet dogs, ranging from 0% to 17.5% (Schulz et al., 2008, Tennant et al., 1993), and somewhat greater in pet dogs with diarrhoea, ranging from 7.9% to 66.3% (Godsall et al., 2010, Soma et al., 2011). CECoV shedding is also common in dogs in rescue kennels, with a reported prevalence of 43\u201359% and 73% in non-diarrhoeic dogs and diarrhoeic dogs, respectively (Sokolow et al., 2005, Tennant et al., 1993). In contrast, no CECoV was isolated from 26 dogs sampled in a boarding kennel (Tennant et al., 1993). Sporadic outbreaks of CECoV-related disease in kennels has led to the suggestion that dogs living in these environments may be more susceptible to CECoV (Benetka et al., 2006, Binn et al., 1974, Ntafis et al., 2010, Tennant et al., 1993).",

The three kennel blocks at R1 each had a distinct intended function. On entry, dogs were usually housed in block 1 (92 kennels) for at least 7 days, and could remain there for the duration of their stay. Block 2 (20 kennels) was used for those dogs deemed by staff to be the most easily re-homed. A dog normally only entered block 2 after its 7-day holding period (a statutory requirement for any stray dog). A small number of dogs which were healthy and had been relinquished by their owners rather than admitted as strays were housed from entry in block 2. Block 3 (32 kennels) was used as a quarantine facility, most frequently for dogs exhibiting signs of upper respiratory tract disease, and also for bitches in season. Most dogs were housed singly, with the exception of bonded pairs relinquished together. Dogs in blocks 1 and 2 were put in individual runs in daytime, whereas dogs in block 3 sometimes shared the use of the outdoor runs, at staff discretion.",

Such environments may be important for maintaining this infection in the general population. In this study, we have for the first time used both cross sectional and longitudinal study designs, together with molecular diagnostics, to provide a unique insight into the epidemiology of this coronavirus in high density, high turnover populations of kennelled dogs. The prevalence of CECoV in the four kennels ranged from 5% to 33%, with type I being both more common. The prevalence in newly housed animals was relatively low, in line with that reported previously in the general dog population (Stavisky et al., 2010, Tennant et al., 1993). During housing, both length of stay and kennel block were significantly associated with infection risk. Shedding patterns and sequence analysis in one of the shelters strongly suggested the viruses were maintained in this population by a combination of introductions into the shelter and within-shelter transmission. This is important, since CECoV may be associated with diarrhoea, and it has been shown that animals with diarrhoea or ill-health have either a delay in being rehomed (Litster et al., 2011), or a greater chance of being returned to the shelter (Wells and Hepper, 1999). As well as its significance to the health of the animals, such studies also provide a marker that other diseases may be readily transmitted in such environments.",

This suggests some exposure to cumulative risk factors (for example infectious burden of CECoV, concurrent infections, stress) likely impact on infection risk. This is similar to studies in feline rescue shelters with the related feline enteric coronavirus, where the prevalence of infection rose from 33% on relinquishment to 60% within one week, with all adults cats that tested positive on both occasions showing a rise in viral titre of 101\u2013106 (Pedersen et al., 2004).

Husbandry factors specific to this block may at least in part explain this risk, since dogs were sometimes mixed in outdoor runs or put into runs which had not been cleaned of faeces and urine from other dogs. This was not common practice in blocks 1 and 2 and, therefore, enhanced opportunity for transmission in the dogs in block 3 may partially explain the different infection rates. Respiratory infection was the most common reason for moving a dog to block 3, and immunocompromise, from concurrent ill-health, may have led to an increased susceptibility to CECoV infection. However, other unmeasured factors could also have contributed to this difference in risk between the three blocks. Using sequence analysis, we showed several dogs contemporaneously housed in this block all shedding the same virus, providing strong evidence for within-kennel transmission. Data such as this, where a risk factor is clearly linked to accommodation, can allow limited resources to be efficiently targeted to those areas where disease transmission is most problematic.",

The level of strain diversity within these populations can, therefore, provide an objective assessment of the biosecurity in such high density populations, identify practices that could be improved (Beersma et al., 2009, Coyne et al., 2007, Radford et al., 2001), and enable the effectiveness of interventions to be monitored.",

The overall prevalence of CECoV appeared higher in the two rescue kennels (13.8% and 33.3%) than the boarding kennels (5.3% and 13.5%), consistent with the pattern seen in previous studies using virus isolation (which only detects type II CECoV), where prevalence rates of 23\u201386% and 0% were seen in rescue and boarding kennels, respectively (Tennant et al., 1993). Numerous reasons could underlie the variations in prevalence shown. The boarding kennels mainly housed owned dogs for relatively short periods. We have shown time is a risk factor for CECoV faecal shedding and many may leave the kennel before they can become infected and/or start shedding. In addition, such dogs are likely to have better health, nutritional status and veterinary care. In contrast, many animals in rescue shelters are young (New et al., 2000), a known risk factor for infection (Tennant et al., 1993, Soma et al., 2011). Unfortunately, reliable data on both demographics and whether the dogs had a history of diarrhoea were not available, due to constraints of limited record keeping (rescue shelters) and data protection (private boarding kennels). Additionally, the success of the longitudinal sampling was impaired by the high turnover of dogs in R1. Further studies in different environments, such as working or hunt kennels, could circumvent these problems and provide valuable additional information.",

There is some uncertainty about which type of CECoV is most prevalent in the population, and most recently it has been suggested that the significance of each type may be different in different countries (Decaro et al., 2011). In this latter study, only eight samples were available from the UK, one of which tested positive for CECoV II. These authors commented that their findings may be compromised by the low number of samples available from the UK. Our findings reported here are consistent with our previous work (Stavisky et al., 2010, Stavisky et al., 2011), which together suggest type I CECoV may be the predominant variant in the UK. The samples here underwent PCR and sequencing in fragments of the variable S gene and conserved M gene in order to allow detection of recombination. No recombination was detected in this study; however sequencing was not successful in both regions for all samples, possibly due to some of the samples being of lower titre. The regions selected, whilst useful in determining transmission patterns and potential recombination events, did not allow differentiation of the CECoV type IIa and IIb (TGEV-like) strains. These \u2018TGEV-like\u2019 strains have been previously recognised in the UK and elsewhere (Decaro et al., 2009, Decaro et al., 2010b, Erles and Brownlie, 2009) and it has been suggested that they may show an enhanced ability to spread systemically, as compared with other strains (Ntafis et al., 2011). In future work it would be to useful to examine both the prevalence of these subtypes in rescue and other kennel populations, and their transmission characteristics.",

For those dogs which shed CECoV for several weeks during the sampling period, peak titres were seen at different points of the infectious period. Therefore, the observed variability of the titres we detected may depend in part on when in the infectious cycle a dog was sampled. There may also be a component of both the immunity of the dog, and the virulence of the strain involved. The mean type I titre detected was slightly higher than type II; this difference was not significantly different, but the same tendency has been observed previously (Decaro et al., 2005). The titres obtained must be considered as semi-quantitative rather than fully quantitative when used as a measure of viral shedding since both the consistency of the faeces and other factors will affect the amount of virus shed.",
