By the 7th January, the 2019-novel Coronavirus had already been isolated by the Chinese Center for Disease Control. The WHO subsequently renamed the 2019-novel Coronavirus as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the disease resulting from the referred to as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).",

NHS England circulated an email from the NHS Medical Director Professor Stephen Powis on March 17, 2020 stating that the Commission of Human Medicines and NICE have been asked to review the current evidence and formulate formal guidance, but in the interim the advice is to use paracetamol to treat fever in COVID-19, avoiding the use of NSAIDs [72] . It stated that patients established on NSAID treatment for other reasons should not discontinue use. The WHO will also gather further evidence before making a formal recommendation.",

This has led to a global effort to create widely available detection assays and to identify a targeted treatment. The cornerstone of management throughout the world is currently supportive management with oxygen therapy alongside treatment for sepsis and ARDS with broad-spectrum antibiotics and careful rationing of intravenous fluids. Stratification of risk is a priority, with a focus on identifying those most at need and most likely to benefit from invasive ventilation. Though some facilities are trialling specific treatments, with hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin most commonly used among these, there are no widely used guidelines as to their use as yet. There is a plethora of expedited clinical trials currently ongoing [73] .",
