Zimmerman examined the way natural resources come in and out of use based on shifting social demands. His work shows how natural resources \u2013 as elements of the biophysical world that have a social value \u2013 are connected to cultural, political, and economic processes. The notion of resource \u201cbecoming\u201d draws attention to these complex social relations, locating the origins of resource emergence in society instead of in an autonomous, disconnected nature. As economic and social interests change over time, so too do the elements that are defined as resources. The underlying appeal of \u201cbecoming\u201d is that it focuses on process, troubling assumptions of resource permanence. Expanding on Zimmermann\u2019s insights, scholars have outlined how resource becoming includes not only the work of the social imagination, but also the material means of knowledge production that create resources as objects of calculation, investment, and value.",

Focusing on mineral resources, I trace how sites of mineral exploration are placed within commodity narratives, in space, and in relation to other resource projects. The prospect of resource potential, I demonstrate, stems from the way exploration companies situate particular targets of exploration within wider sites and temporalities of resource provisioning. While scholars have drawn attention to the practices of calculation, measurement, and labor through which certain subsoil domains become resources, my analysis draws attention to the relational elsewheres of resource potential. I show how potential in one location is engendered through particular practices of placement. I utilize place here, then, not as a noun, as in much of the rich literature on place, but as a verb, to place. Just as scholars have shown how places are dynamic, tied to narrative formation, and articulated through selective incorporation of external processes (Massey, 1995, Hoelscher, 2003, Martin, 2003), placing resources is a process that links areas of exploration with extra-local narratives, sites, and associations.",

            "text": "I develop this argument through an analysis of metallic minerals and the junior mining sector. So-called \u201cjuniors\u201d are small mining companies that seek investment to explore mineral resource prospects around the globe. It is through these actors, social spheres, and investment mediums that the majority of metallic resources (gold, copper, nickel, silver, etc.) become mineral commodities. In contrast with the considerable body of scholarship on mining giants like Newmont, Rio Tinto, and BHP Billiton (Welker, 2014, Rajak, 2011, Kirsch, 2014), there has been much less written about junior companies, which number in the thousands (for exceptions see Tsing 2000; Majury 2013; Author 2016). Unlike the giants, junior companies are not focused primarily on mining; they are more interested in resource speculation and exploration. Some junior companies produce viable mining operations, but most produce very little. If successful, they often sell out to or partner with larger mining companies. Even junior companies that fail to identify a viable mineral deposit are often successful in garnering investment along the way. \u201cPlacing resources\u201d encapsulates the tactics that these junior companies employ to promote themselves and their projects. The data I present center primarily on copper, but the dynamics I discuss are widespread across the minerals that underpin the junior sector.",

Articulations of shale gas potential in Europe, for example, have taken shape within discourses that emphasize the need for lower-carbon energy as well as energy security vis-\u00e0-vis Russia (Kuchler 2017). In the case of Estonia, ideas of national patrimony have combined with energy security, producing what Kama (2016) productively terms the \u201ccontending geo-logics\u201d of shale oil extraction. This scholarship underscores how resources emerge in particular sites within temporal projections of the future (Olofsson, 2019, Childs, 2018) and spatial geopolitics of those locations (Valdivia 2015). It illustrates the multiplicity of actors within the public sphere who navigate uncertain and contested fields of knowledge and politics. These conflicts are not just disputes over resource extraction, but constitute the very arenas through which resources emerge as objects of significance (Kama, 2019, Lis et al., 2019).",

Yet unlike the public realms and diverse political contexts examined in previous work, the sphere in which junior mining companies promote their projects to potential investors is more confined. Moreover, the grids of space and time in which junior companies place their projects are largely constructed by the junior companies themselves. The value of \u201cplacing\u201d as a theoretical framework, therefore, stems not only from its descriptive accuracy, but from the way it centers on the agency and actions of junior companies.",

            "text": "Placing resources is at root a process of producing potential. Potential refers to the capacity or latent ability to become something in the future. As Giorgio Agamben argues, however, potential also means impotentiality, or the equal likelihood of something not happening (Agamben 1999: 177-184; Agamben 1995: 44-48). In other words, potential evokes a field of possible outcomes between un-becoming and actualization. A helpful illustration of the dialectics of potentiality comes from Mette Svendsen\u2019s (2011) study of fertility clinics in Denmark, where couples are asked to donate unused embryos for biomedical science. It is the blank space of disposal, the prospect that this biological material would otherwise be thrown away, that helps donating couples envision alternative potentials for embryonic cells within fields of biomedical science. The articulation of potentiality, Svendsen shows, is thus one that arises from the resetting of particular narratives that place cell material into new temporal and ontological fields of possibility. Like the blank spaces that help produce new understandings of potential for embryonic cells, the impotentiality of resource exploration \u2013 the notion that sites of mineralization might produce nothing of value \u2013 is embedded within the work of junior mining companies. This resonates with Ian Hacking\u2019s description of speculation \u2013 \u201ca playing with and restructuring of ideas to give at least a qualitative understanding of some general feature of the world\u201d (Hacking 1983: 213). Placing resources describes the way junior mining companies \u201cplay with\u201d and \u201crestructure\u201d commodity narratives, notions of space, and comparative projects to elicit \u201cqualitative understandings\u201d of potential for their exploration targets.",

            "text": "Literature on resource becoming has emphasized the importance of resource ontologies, the types of knowledge, narratives, and politics that help determine what resources are, how they are known, and what social formations might arise from their emergence (Richardson and Weszkalyns 2014). Building on this work, my examination calls for more focused consideration of ontologies of resource potential. Theorization of resource ontology includes, of course, underlying questions of potential, as Kama\u2019s (2019) analysis of \u201cunconventional resources\u201d effectively shows. Rhetorically parsing out potential is nevertheless a useful way to avoid some of the pitfalls associated with discourses of resource inevitability \u2013 the powerful notion across popular, political, and academic spheres that resource presence means eventual resource extraction (Nader, 2004, Chapman, 2013, Hughes, 2017). Junior companies, after all, may describe their projects as resources, but what they are really asking investors to do is to see their projects as having resource potential. In her analysis of oil exploration in Sao Taome y Principe, Gisa Weszkalnys (2015) describes how the prospect of petroleum depends upon \u201cobservations of potential\u201d to ward off doubt that nothing is really there (Weszkalnys 2016). In a competitive marketplace of investment, junior companies likewise require continuous observations of potential, which may or may not relate directly to the subsoil domains they are targeting. Just as recent work asks about the locus of energy materiality (Balmaceda et al. 2019: 2), placing resources is an inquiry into the locus of mineral potential.",

This includes the large annual meeting of the Prospectors and Development Association of Canada (PDAC), held in Toronto, and the smaller Vancouver Resource Investment Conference (VRIC). The five-day PDAC meeting, with an average of 25,000 attendees, and the three-day VRIC meeting, with an average of 4,000 attendees are spaces where financial investors and mineral exploration companies situate themselves and each other within overlapping storylines of global markets and subsoil resources. Venues like PDAC and VRIC are important arenas of cultural production in the way they establish and reinforce industry norms, practices, and expectations (Rajak 2011). In this way, these large and small gatherings embody a shared social world that assorted actors refer to as \u201cthe junior mining space.\u201d Both the PDAC and VRIC conferences feature commodity and market assessments by industry research firms as well as a group of industry analysts called metal writers, who offer their assessments of junior companies for an annual fee. Hundreds of junior companies occupy booths on the large convention floors, pitching their projects to potential investors, handing out one-page information sheets and multi-page documents called corporate presentations. The corporate presentations are often what the companies present in 15-minute sessions away from the convention floor, and in one-on-one meetings. I conducted participant observation at the 2016, 2017, 2018, and 2019 PDAC meetings and the 2019 and 2020 sessions of VRIC. During these meetings I attended sessions on commodity forecasts, observed interactions in the exhibition halls, and conducted informal interviews with junior company representatives and industry analysts. The aspects of promotion that I focus on here span the realm between enthusiastic hype and more ritualized forms of communication. Promotion to investors is an essential, if not always successful, part of what junior companies do.",

In the following part of the article, I analyze place as a practice of location, examining the ways that junior companies locate their projects in space by positioning their exploration targets in relation to existing mines or other sites of exploration. In the final part of the article, I examine place as a practice of juxtaposition, outlining the ways that junior companies selectively compare their projects, or elements of their projects, with other junior companies as a way to foster distinction and value. These distinct variations of place, including situating, locating, and juxtaposing, capture the spatial and temporal ways in which juniors cultivate notions of resource potential.",

            "text": "In his presentation on the future of copper at the 2019 PDAC meetings, Michael Schwartz of Teck Resources, a Canadian mining company, framed his talk around two images of street scenes in New York City \u2013 one from 1900 that was full of horses another from 1913 that was full of cars. Looking at the 1900 image, Schwartz challenged the audience to \u201cfind the car.\u201d Viewing the 1913 image, Schwartz wondered if anyone could then \u201cfind the horse.\u201d Such a rapid transition from horse to car over a span of 13 years, Schwartz suggested, had important lessons for the future of copper. World consumption of copper totaled around 22 million tons in 2017. By 2028, according to sources compiled by Schwartz, the world will demand between 4 to 8 million tons more, with even further rates of growth by mid-century. Part of this increase will come from China, the world\u2019s largest consumer of copper. A more profound source of demand, Schwartz detailed, will come from the centrality of copper in a world increasingly defined by electrification and the utilization of carbon-free power. Schwartz then showed slides that highlighted the difference in copper content between conventional cars (18kg), hybrid cars (60kg), and battery powered cars (85kg). When factoring in the copper needed for hybrid and electrical buses (90kg and 370kg, respectively), as well as the many tons of copper required for solar panels, windmills, and everyday electrification, Schwartz forecast a future in which copper will replace petroleum as one of the key materials of modern social life.",

From his emphasis on horses and automobiles in New York to his reiteration of the projected increase in copper content across green infrastructure, Schwartz was visibly animated about the future importance of copper. His repeated emphasis on the differences in copper content between various items underscored his point that the upper limits of potential copper usage are unknown. Though his presentation centered on copper demand, Schwartz\u2019s enthusiasm was really about copper supply, and the prospect of copper deficits that such a shift in modern infrastructure would bring about. As he then illustrated, predictions of increased copper demand parallel forecasts of dwindling copper supply. The world\u2019s largest copper mines, Schwartz explained, are reaching the end of their productive lives. What is more, discovery of new copper deposits has not kept pace to offset these potential declines. As Schwartz outlined, this signifies a potential difference between global demand and global supply of nearly 10 million tons of copper by 2030. Thus, three storylines of increased demand, decreased supply, and limited discovery converged in Schwartz\u2019s presentation to comprise an overall discourse of projected copper deficits.",

These forecasts tend to say more about contemporary issues and anxieties than they do future resource constraints. While most in the junior mining industry take the prospect of copper deficits as a given, this assessment is not universal across all fields of mineral geology. Recent scholarship suggests that existing copper mines are more than able to supply copper needs well into the future (Mudd and Jowitt, 2018a, Mudd and Jowitt, 2018b). Reflecting a similar point, one industry analysis from the London-based CRU Group even raised the possibility of a future copper surplus (Mining Journal, 4/9/19). The price of copper is less in 2019 than it was in 2014. Trade disputes between the US and China, combined with slowing economic growth, as well as anxieties about the coronavirus, indicate strong headwinds facing copper in the near and short term. The immediate horizon of price uncertainty underscores the extent to which predictions of future copper deficits (and elevated copper prices) represent what Jane Guyer has termed \u201cevangelical time,\u201d the orientation towards long-term horizons that obfuscate more medium-term timescales (Guyer 2007). Consistent with Guyer\u2019s notion of future horizons marked by change, temporalities of copper deficits take as a given major political and economic transformations. Discourses of copper deficits are evangelical, in Guyer\u2019s sense of the term, in that they imagine a world after \u2013 after major shifts in energy production and distribution have taken place.",

Optimistic forecasts of future copper demand suggest an increase of around 20-25% by 2030. Unlike the incremental year-on-year uptick in demand displayed by aggregate figures of projected copper use, the difference between 15 and 60 is more dramatic. In the same way that a social world defined by horses could not fully anticipate a world defined by automobiles, the increase from 15 to 60 suggests that the future world of copper usage may even be beyond our current forecasts.",

In these investor sessions, as well as the promotional material that populate the trading floors at these conferences, imagery of hybrid cars, solar panels, and electrification is abundant, as are graphs that emphasize future deficits. A common framing is found in the promotional pamphlets of Trilogy Metals, a junior company with exploration projects in northwest Alaska. Echoing its investor presentation that I attended in 2018, Trilogy\u2019s 2018 investor pamphlet opens with bolded text that says, \u201cCopper = Energy.\u201d A series of bullet points in relation to hi-tech energy and the Paris Climate Accord underscore interest in copper.

Trilogy\u2019s 2019 investor pamphlet went one step further, its first page adorned with images of a solar panel, a windmill, and an electric car (Figure 1\n). Like Trilogy and Carube Copper, the twitter feeds of junior explorers with interests in copper feature a stream of imagery associated with green infrastructure. Sierra Metals, a company with exploration projects in Peru and Mexico, for example re-tweeted (in early 2018) an infographic that compared the copper content between a VW Golf (20kg) and Chevrolet Bolt (82kg).",

This sort of alignment is one that suggests a resonance between the prospect of copper scarcity and the present value of junior companies\u2019 exploration targets. The temporalities of resource potential and deficit forecasts, therefore, seem to align: Just as one imagines copper deficits, the other suggests copper presence. This sense of correspondence is defined by the temporal tense of the future perfect, a tense \u201cin which the present becomes a mode of pastness by being projected into a perfected future\u201d (Povinelli 2011:168).

The sense of equivalence between Chile and Ecuador becomes a proposition whereby Chile\u2019s history of copper mining morphs into Ecuador\u2019s present mineral potential and future resource extraction. Indeed, Ecuadorian officials actively promote the notion that Ecuador is the next Chile. In its recent round of promotion, SolGold makes these arguments while adding in a novel twist related to the future meanings of copper, equating copper in the 21st century to steel in the 20th.

This is the project that they are seeking investment for in order to continue exploration activities in the immediate term. Their overall portfolios, however, are not restricted to these sites. Alongside these primary projects, juniors also promote early stage exploration projects. In other words, junior companies not only place their flagship projects in relation to existing mines and sites proven mineralization, but also in relation to more speculative areas. These are often located in the same district as the flagship project, but not always. For example, Candente Copper\u2019s flagship project in Peru is called Canarico Norte, which the company describes as a feasibility-stage project with measured and indicated resources. Alongside Canarico Norte, Candente is also promoting Canarico Sur, a copper-gold-sliver prospect, which the company defines through a language of unknown potential. The meaning of Canarico Sur is less about what areas of mineralization have been explored and more about the spaces that have not. When I asked one industry analyst about why junior companies seem to pair exploration of their flagship project with sites of greater of uncertainty, he said that junior companies never want to let go of the \u201cexploration upside.\u201d In other words, junior companies actively cultivate a balance sheet of mineral potential; potentiality does not disappear into actualization (Agamben 1995: 45).",

Of interest to how we understand resource potential is the temporal story that comes with this practice of placing. Aligning these primary projects alongside ones of even greater uncertainty connects future extraction on the flagship property with future exploration in other locations. This produces a temporal horizon of exploration that continually resets the temporalities of potential.

            "text": "Walking through the Vancouver Resource Investment Conference in late January 2019, I approached a large booth sponsored by Xanadu Mines, a junior exploration company that has been targeting copper projects in Mongolia. On a large poster on one side of the company\u2019s booth, Xanadu promoters showed a cross section of the Zaraa project, its most advanced exploration site. It was placed directly next to a cross section of SolGold\u2019s Cascabel project in northern Ecuador. In this case, however, the logic of the comparison was not to draw on the reputation of the Cascabel to indicate the promise of the Zaraa project, but to make that comparison so as to set the Zaraa project apart. The Cascabel deposit is fairly deep, situated some 600 meters underground, a location that raises concerns about the deposit\u2019s economic viability. Underground block-caving, as opposed to open-pit mining, requires a higher grade of mineral content to be economically viable. In contrast, Xanadu\u2019s Zaraa deposit is significantly closer to the surface. Placed side-by-side, the depth of Cascabel helped frame the significance and meaning of Zaraaa, and Xanadu\u2019s argument that its project represented one the best \u201cnear surface\u201d or \u201cshallow copper projects\u201d in the world. Near surface is a marker of potentiality, the notion that the subsoil position of Zaraa makes it more likely that its copper mineralization will become a viable copper mine.",

Talking with one of Xanadu\u2019s exploration geologists about both deposits, he initially narrated the difference in straightforward geological terms. Half-jokingly, I asked, \u201cBut what you really seem to be saying is that Zaraa is better than Cascabel?\u201d He laughed knowingly. This precipitated a conversation about investment. The geologist admitted that, in a world of limited investment capital, the juxtaposed image was an argument that investors should prioritize Xanadu due to the accessibility of the Zaraa deposit. The notion of \u201cshallow copper\u201d runs throughout Xanadu\u2019s promotional material. Numerous bubble graphs highlight the seeming uniqueness of Xanadu\u2019s projects by placing these projects on graphs that show depth and copper content for existing mines and ones in development. As I saw at VRIC 2020, Regulus Minerals, with copper exploration projects in Peru, likewise used a graph that compared the depths of its exploratory drill holes with those of SolGold to articulate an argument of near surface. The fact that SolGold is a recurring target of comparison is not only a function of the depth of its Casabel prospect, but also because SolGold is very well-known, due in large part, to the scope of the company\u2019s promotional activities.",

It refers to the cluster of NGEX projects, but it also acts as a proper noun, the name of one larger project instead the assemblage of three smaller ones.

Of this group, NGEX shows, only three undeveloped projects are in the hands of junior mining companies. Despite what seems to be an abundance of copper exploration projects, the graph argues that NGEX is one of a select few projects that exist within the investment space of junior mining companies. A corresponding map of the world plots junior-held copper projects, subtitled by the phrase \u201cThere are not that many!\u201d (NGEX Resources 2018). In the same way that \u201cnear surface\u201d is not an obvious attribute of Xanadu\u2019s project, the impression made by NGEX that its project represents one of a select few large copper projects with the investment upside of a junior company is a narrative that the company must produce through selective comparison, an articulation of potential that emerges when NGEX places its \u201cconstellation\u201d project alongside others.

Even though it was omitted by NGEX\u2019s map of valuable copper prospects, SolGold often places its drill hole data against drill holes from other notable copper mines. In the company presentation to an Ecuador-sponsored investment forum at the 2017 PDAC meetings, for example, the CEO displayed a graph that showed 25 drill results of high copper content. 17 of these results were from SolGold. The remaining were from known mining sites from around the world. In this way, SolGold reinforces its argument about geological richness and high copper content by enlisting drill results from elsewhere. SolGold\u2019s drill results, this graph shows, are distinct. In framing its drill results around those of existing mines, SolGold also suggests a degree of equivalence. If these other drill tests ended up becoming economically viable mines, the same must be true of SolGold\u2019s project. Unlike Xanadu\u2019s description of the company, SolGold\u2019s comparisons erase questions of depth.",

The stories of resource projects are not confined to the narrative elements of those prospects, but rest on the selective deployment of stories told elsewhere..

In a world that demands more than 30 million tons of copper, the red metal is everywhere: from automobiles and buses to solar panels, windmills, and enhanced electrical grids. For junior companies, however, the appeal of this world made of copper is really about absence \u2013 a projected shortage in copper production from both existing mines and those slated to come online. It is the scope and scale of this deficit that junior companies evoke to justify current exploration projects and gesture towards resource potential. Absence factors into discourses of copper deficits in another way. The prospect of global copper deficits presumes that political and social systems will transform in significant ways. Green infrastructure is taken as inevitable, obfuscating the politics of this transition and the forces that are aligned against it.",

For junior companies, therefore, the prospect of copper deficits is a global phenomenon but not a local one. At least not a local one for individual companies. For even as junior companies emphasize the exploration upside of their projects, they are often less generous in how they talk about the projects of other companies. The sense of distinction undertaken by junior companies through selective juxtapositions is an argument about scarcity. These comparisons make it seem as though there are only a few projects worth investing in. From Xanadu Mine\u2019s argument about a scarcity of easy-to-mine \u201cnear surface\u201d projects to NGEX Resources\u2019 notion that only three junior companies control large copper projects, or Kutcho Copper\u2019s emphasis on the company\u2019s comparative investment value, these juxtapositions reinforce notions of absence.
