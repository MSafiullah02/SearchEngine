Breast-feeding is the predominant route of vertical transmission and occurs through ingestion of infected milkborne lymphocytes. According to epidemiologic studies from Japan, 15\u201320% of children of seropositive mothers acquire HTLV-1 through breast-feeding [1], whereas only 1\u20132% of bottle-fed infants of mothers positive for HTLV-1 become infected. Transmission appears to increase with the number of months that the infant has nursed. Recent data from Japan suggest that babies who were short-term breast-feeders (for 6 months or less) showed a statistically significant lower seroconversion rate than long-term breast-feeders: 3.9% vs 20.3% [2,3].",

Among children, the prevalence rate of both sexes is low, about 1%, and the male-to-female ratio is 1. Starting with adolescence, however, the prevalence increases and infection rates between males and females diverge, with female rates exceeding male rates. This trend continues into adulthood, and whereas male rates plateau by the age of 40 years, female rates continue to increase and peak at about age 60 years [7]. The reason for this divergence is ascribed to the fact that although sexual transmission is bidirectional, male-to-female transmission occurs 10 times much more efficiently. For example, some studies report that after 10 years of sexual contact with an infected partner, a woman has a 61% likelihood of being infected, as opposed to only 0.4% for a man [8]. In a Japanese cohort study of 100 discordant couples practicing unprotected sexual intercourse, there were seven seroconversions during 5 years of observation. Uninfected females were 3.9 times more likely to become infected than uninfected males [9].",

A study of young pregnant women (<30 years old) in French Guiana demonstrated that factors such as high gravidity, a high parity, and a negative Rhesus factor were independently linked to an increased risk of HTLV-1 seropositivity [10]. It has been postulated that the increase in HTLV-1 prevalence rates in the younger than 30 age group could be the result of high levels of sexual transmission in this population. In Jamaica or French West Indies, for example, women who were HTLV-1 seropositive were slightly more likely to have had more than three lifetime sex partners, earlier age at first sexual intercourse, and a history of sexually transmitted diseases [10, 11, 12]. In many studies an increased risk of seropositivity has been seen with increasing age but also with prior miscarriages, caesarian sections, and high gravidity. These factors are known to be associated with a low socioeconomic level, and they could reflect sexual activity and a high number of lifetime sexual partners [10]. Sexual transmission of HTLV-2 has been difficult to study.",

With HTLV-1 infection, the lifetime risk of developing HAM/TSP was estimated to be 1.9% overall and is slightly higher in women (1.8%) than in men (1.3%) [13]. Thus, the higher prevalence of HTLV-1 in women living in endemic areas does not fully explain the preponderance of female HAM/TSP, suggesting that other cofactors may be present. It has been postulated that the overrepresentation of females and the increase in incidence with age are indicative of the predominance of infections acquired through sexual transmission [13,14].",

Better supportive care and specific antiviral therapy have decreased this mortality to 13\u201314% [36], and more recent reports show further reductions [37]. Maternal smoking, 100 or more skin lesions, and the third trimester of pregnancy are associated with a higher risk of varicella pneumonia [38]. Because of these findings, varicella\u2013zoster immune globulin (VZIG) is recommended as prophylaxis for pregnant women who are VZV seronegative who have had significant exposure to chickenpox. VZIG provides passive immunization against VZV and is effective in preventing or ameliorating disease in children. It is effective if given within 72 hours of exposure and may be effective if given up to 96 hours after exposure, but once disease is established, its efficacy is questionable. A new formulation of VZIG appears to result in higher maternal antibody levels and is comparable in efficacy and safety to standard VZIG. Acyclovir may also be used to protect against VZV infection and to treat established infection. Data on outcomes from 1129 prospectively followed acyclovir-exposed pregnancies (712 involving first-trimester exposure) were reported to a voluntary registry from June 1984 through December 1997. The data fail to show an increase in the number of birth defects identified among the fetuses exposed to acyclovir when compared with those expected in the general population. In addition, no pattern of defects was seen, suggesting that maternal acyclovir use in pregnancy is safe [39]. Varicella vaccine was licensed in 1995 to prevent chickenpox. Because it is a live-virus vaccine, its use is contraindicated in pregnancy. The Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS) had received 87 reports of inadvertent vaccination of pregnant women as of July 25, 1998. None of these exposures resulted in characteristic features of congenital varicella syndrome in the exposed fetuses [40]. It is interesting that 19 pregnant women received varicella vaccine by mistake (instead of VZIG) after chickenpox exposure, suggesting that health care workers need to be educated to eliminate confusion between these agents.",

These infections are usually benign and self-limiting, but in up to 2% of cases occurring between 13 and 20 weeks of gestation, a characteristic constellation of findings known as the congenital varicella syndrome (CVS) may occur [42]. This syndrome is often severe and is characterized by skin lesions, limb hypoplasia, microcephaly, prematurity, chorioretinitis, mental retardation, and early death. Despite advances in the field, the syndrome remains difficult to predict. Negative PCR results for VZV in amniotic fluid is associated with a favorable outcome; however, a positive test correlates poorly with the development of CVS and it is not clear that the benefit of the test outweighs the risk of amniocentesis [41]. It is recommended that pregnant women who develop chickenpox during pregnancy be counseled about the risk of CVS.",

Babies exposed to maternal varicella in the first 28 days of life also have increased risk of severe infections. VZIG is therefore recommended for all infants exposed to maternal varicella from 7 days prior to delivery up to 28 days after birth. Infants of mothers with zoster during the perinatal period are protected by maternal antibody and are not at increased risk of serious infection.

In most epidemiologic studies, fluctuations in the incidence of influenza have been compared with the birth dates of patients with schizophrenia, based on the assumption that the risk of the mother being infected with the virus was associated with occurrence of an influenza epidemic during the pregnancy [60]. To date there is only one retrospective study that has attempted to answer this question. The study looked at more than 900 patients with schizophrenia born in France between 1949 and 1981, using nonschizophrenic siblings as controls, and documented that significantly more patients with schizophrenia than controls had been exposed to the virus during the fifth month of pregnancy [60]. Currently inactivated influenza vaccine is recommended for routine use in women who will be in the second or third trimesters of pregnancy. The basis for this recommendation is the high risk of exposure and disease resulting from influenza viruses in pregnant women as well as the impact of influenza virus infection on the fetus and infant derived mostly from historical data [61].",

The transplacental infection of the fetus presumably occurred during symptomatic maternal viremic illness, primarily during the first and second trimesters, and was documented in 21 out of 33. Mice infected in utero asymptomatically shed LCMV in their feces, urine, saliva, breast milk, and semen and transmit the infection to humans (and hamsters) by direct contact or inhalation. Therefore, pregnant women should be advised to avoid contact with these rodents and their secretions, as they are similarly counseled to avoid contact with cat litter to prevent congenital toxoplasmosis [68,70,71].",
