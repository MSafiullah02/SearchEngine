            "text": "Telemedicine coverage policies are complex, dynamic and geographically specific. Much of the current policies have limited the extent to which patients can be cared for remotely. Many jurisdictions have strict requirements as to the type of provider, the location of the patient, and medium of communication. In addition, barriers to engaging patients where they are, are driven by early conceptions for telehealth. For example, HIV-related telemedicine was primarily developed as a way for HIV specialists or consultants to provide care to remote areas, including rural contexts, or to inaccessible patients, such as incarcerated persons. In such cases, there is local control on both ends of the connection with well-established and controlled systems. In Illinois, for example, the provision of care required patients to be in a clinical setting. This system has recently been upended by the COVID-19 pandemic in order to increase social distancing.",

            "text": "On March 17th, 2020, the telehealth waiver in Medicare under HR 6047 was implemented, allowing for an expanded fee for services provision [1, 2]. While the provision did not expand the allowable types of secure digital platforms or disciplines of care providers, this change importantly eliminated site limitations for patients, such that a patient-centered approach can be deployed allowing for patients to be seen where they wish. Clearly, this is perfect social distancing in a COVID-19 context. It ensures that providers and patients are kept as safe as possible, with the additional benefit of helping providers avoid clinical contexts that have additional coronavirus transmission risk, particularly in hyperepidemic locations such as New York City. As a case example of Illinois, academic medical centers such as the University of Chicago, and Federally Qualified Health Centers, such as Howard Brown Health, rapidly transitioned scheduled patients to telemedicine, developed telemedicine protocols, billing algorithms, and HIPPAA compliant communication videoconferencing platforms. This occurred over days with clinical flows and patient acceptability still being examined. From an implementation science perspective, there are several important questions around telemedicine effectiveness, feasibility, acceptability and contextual variation [3]. In addition, while COVID-19 presents a unique solution to social distancing, it is unclear how telemedicine will change as we move to the post-COVID era and how HIV and routine PrEP care may be impacted.",

For example, social media discussions about HIV and syphilis-related risk behaviors can be modeled with artificial intelligence to monitor and predict future cases within regions, helping to inform interventions that can be digitally delivered and tailored to at-risk populations [4]. Social media and mobile apps can also be used to engage and retain patients at risk for and living with HIV, helping to keep them connected to clinical care during times when non-essential in-person visits are discouraged. The already widespread use of these technologies makes them appropriate tools for keeping patients engaged in care. Automatically-responding chatbots, can be also be integrated into health settings, such as by asking questions and routing patients to appropriate educational resources or next steps for treatment (e.g., setting up an appointment) based on responses. For example, specific to COVID-19, the CDC has released a Coronavirus self-checker tool to assess symptoms and provide recommendations for next steps based on screening results [5]. Tools like this could be adapted for the special needs of HIV populations, including items on substance use-related risk behaviors and HIV medication adherence in order to assess comorbid risks between HIV, COVID-19, substance, and mental health.",

For example, respiratory, oxygen saturation, and temperature sensors can be used to monitor vital signs among patients, such as for substance use/addiction medicine treatment monitoring, hypertensive medication adherence, and pulmonary care patients. Biosensor technologies can also facilitate social distancing between patients, and between high-risk COVID-19 patients and providers. Newer approaches (e.g., digital contact tracing) are using bluetooth signals to identify whether and when people have been social/physical distancing by assessing distances between 2 or more phones/mobile devices. Data from these devices can be used to not only inform social distancing efforts but also to inform HIV research efforts, as these methods of measuring distances between phones might be integrated into HIV studies to hypothesize whether and when people are engaging in sexual risk behaviors.",

However, studies, including a report from the Agency for Health Research and Quality, largely support use of these tools to remotely monitor patients and keep them engaged, if used correctly [7]. Findings suggest that these tools are especially impactful when delivered based on specific rather than general needs (e.g., keeping HIV patients engaged in socially-distanced care), and on evidenced-based behavioral and social science frameworks.",
