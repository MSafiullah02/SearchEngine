The diagnosis was initially missed, and the patients were not isolated until a formal diagnosis was made. By that time, infection had been transmitted to a visitor to another patient in the ward; a 28-year-old man, who later died. The need to screen all patients with suspected infectious disease in the medical emergency outpatient department (EMOPD), and for control and prevention of infection, was recognized. Two community physicians were deputed to assess the situation, and an outbreak control committee was formed. This arrangement lapsed when the plague situation was controlled.",

Use of fitness-tested personal protective equipment in all patient-care areas has been shown to prevent nosocomial spread of SARS.10 In our study, provision of the recommended N-95 masks was delayed due to late procurement. Such personal protective equipment should be permanently available in an EMOPD.",

They should collaborate with the infection control committee, disaster management committee, local board of health, and other providers to develop protocols and policies. They should hold disaster drills in which they must handle infectious patients. EMOPD staff, particularly the triage nurses, need training in the early recognition of presenting symptoms of infectious diseases.15 WHO has established a Global Alert and Response Network to monitor and track infectious diseases outbreaks, which should allow EMOPDs to anticipate future problems.16\n",
