Parreno et al. found a mean duration of rotavirus shedding of 6-10 days, but results were quite variable, with some animals becoming chronic shedders with virus present up to 3 weeks post-inoculation. 20 Experimental studies that examined faecal shedding of coronavirus indicate that coronavirus antigen is able to be detected throughout the period of diarrhoea. 21 As with many of the enteropathogens, rotavirus and coronavirus can be identified in the faeces of healthy and diseased animals, 2 so a simple dichotomous diagnostic test is insufficient to establish causality.

The assay described by Decaro et al. 15 was compared with our TaqMan-based assay and produced very similar results, but the assay used here sometimes had slightly higher analytical sensitivity (Kirkland, unpubl. data) Guiterrez-Aguierre et al. were the first to describe a real-time TaqMan qRT-PCR for the detection of both human and animal rotaviruses. 22 Both the rotavirus and coronavirus qRT-PCR assays used in the present study were found to be invaluable and provided the capacity for relative quantification of the amount of viral RNA in the samples. Evidence of high viral load in samples tested using qRT-PCR gives the clinician more confidence that the virus identified is likely to be involved in the disease process.

Contradicting this argument, a proportion of the ELISAnegative/qRT-PCR-positive samples had low Ct values, indicating a high viral load. However, the different analytes that are detected by these assays should not be overlooked and it is possible that the relatively stable double-stranded RNA of rotavirus may persist under adverse conditions for longer than the protein viral antigens. The rotavirus ELISA assay used in this study targeted the VP7 outer capsule protein. Degradation of the outer virion protein has been described as a cause of false negatives in rotavirus ELISA assays, 27 and stabilisation of the outer capsid can be achieved by including calcium chloride. 28 False-negative results may also reflect the presence of complexing antibodies, high concentrations of faecal material, decreased affinity of detecting antibodies or the presence of proteases. 5, 9, 21, 29, 30 The poor sensitivity of the coronavirus ELISA assay may also in part reflect the limits of detection. However, the poor correlation between the ELISA and qRT-PCR suggests that the variance in the results is likely to reflect other variables. The commercial ELISA evaluated in this study used a polyclonal antibody against the spike protein (S) protein. The viral envelope of coronavirus consists of the nucleocapsid (N) protein and four structural proteins (the haemagglutinin-esterase (HE), S protein, small membrane protein (E) and transmembrane protein (M)). [31] [32] [33] The S protein of coronavirus is a common antigen used for ELISA assays. 12, 34 Antigenic variability in the S protein has been observed, because of polymorphism in the S protein, and this variation has been attributed to a single point mutation in the S gene, 21, 35 which may lead to altered antibody binding. False negatives may also be related to loss of S protein during degradation of virions or during transport and processing of samples. 36, 37 The development and application of quick, calf-side diagnostic tests is appealing to veterinary practitioners and producers because it avoids the inherent delays associated with shipping samples to diagnostic laboratories. For these tests to provide benefit to livestock producers, it is important that users appreciate each test's limitations. Validation data for commercially available diagnostic tests are often scarce and may be difficult to obtain.

Possible reasons may be the increased limit of detection in qRT-PCR compared with normal RT-PCR 23 and a different prevalence of viral pathogens in the two studies (i.e. the prevalence of coronavirus according to RT-PCR in the study of Klein et al. was 38%, whereas it was 22% in our study, and the prevalence of rotavirus in their study was 38.9% compared with 80% in our study).", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "A possible explanation for the poor performance of the dipstick is that the antigen against which the LAT dipsticks were targeted may have been damaged in transport. It is possible that better results may have been achieved if the dipsticks had been used at the point of sample collection. The application of the tests in the current study was consistent with the use of the dipsticks in a veterinary clinic or diagnostic laboratory.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The sensitivity of the LAT when compared with ELISA for the detection of rotavirus was moderate (67.8%), with very good specificity (95.2%). A previous study comparing the detection of rotavirus using LAT found a sensitivity and specificity of 70% and 100%, respectively, when compared with electron microscopy of 74 faecal samples from calves with acute diarrhoea. 6 Luginb\u00fchl et al. 39 also found that the same rotavirus dipstick as that studied by Klein et al. 38 had much lower sensitivity (57%), but the specificity was greater (100%) when compared with an ELISA for the detection of antigens in the faeces of 60 calves. Possible reasons for the difference in our results are that the sample size was much greater in our study and a more sensitive technology was used as the reference assay.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "The sensitivity and specificity of both the commercial ELISA and LAT assays evaluated in this study were low compared with qRT-PCR. The low positive and negative predictive values of the assays suggest that they were of limited diagnostic benefit in the population sampled. The qRT-PCR assays offer an alternative diagnostic methodology that is both sensitive and semiquantitative, and thus more informative for clinicians interpreting the significance of a pathogen during disease investigations. Further studies are warranted to develop a better understanding of the clinical relevance of the different levels of viral RNA detected by qRT-PCR assays. When this information becomes available, the higher cost of qRT-PCR assays may be offset by both their superior diagnostic performance and the value of the quantitative information that can be obtained.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF0": {"ref_id": "b0", "title": "Improved detection of bovine coronavirus N gene in faeces of calves
