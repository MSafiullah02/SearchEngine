Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study of 16 MERS-CoV patients, to describe the hematological, hepatic, and renal findings of patients with MERS-CoV. Results: During the 21 days of observation, there was no significant change in the hepatic panel or creatinine tests. There was a significant increase in the mean AE SD of the white blood cell count from 8.3 AE 4.6 to 14.53 AE 7 (P value = 0.001) and an increase in mean AE SD of the absolute neutrophil count from 6.33 AE 4.2 to 12 AE 5.5 (P value = 0.015).
