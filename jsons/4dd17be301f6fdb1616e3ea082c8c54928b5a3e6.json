            "text": "A phenomenological model to describe the Corona Virus Pandemic spread in a given population is developed. It enables the identification of the key quantities required to form adequate policies for control and mitigation in terms of observable parameters using the Landau-Stuart equation. It is intended to be complementary to detailed simulations and methods published recently by Ferguson et al, March 16, (2020). The results suggest that the initial growth/spreading rate \u03b3 c of the disease, and the fraction of infected persons in the population p i (0) can be used to define a \"retardation/inhibition co-efficient\" k * , which is a measure of the effectiveness of the control policies adopted. The results are obtained analytically and numerically using a simple Python code. The solutions provide both qualitative and quantitative information. They substantiate and justify two basic control policies enunciated by WHO and adopted in many countries: a) Systematic and early intensive testing individuals for covid-19 and b) Sequestration policies such as \"social distancing\" and \"population density reduction\" by strict quarantining are essential for making k * > 1, necessary for suppressing the pandemic. The model indicates that relaxing such measures when the infection rate starts to decrease as a result of earlier policies could simply restart the infection rate in the non-infected population. Presently available available statistical data in WHO and other reports can be readily used to determine the the key parameters of the model. Possible extensions to the basic model to make it more realistic are indicated.",

I was motivated to think about this after reading the data presented by reputable sources [1] and the nowjustly famous paper by Ferguson et al, (2019) [2] . The results obtained by expert epidemiologists depend upon detailed statistical/stochastic modelling based on available data from various countries hardest hit by the Covid-19 Pandemic and on plausible hypotheses. One might term these models as \"microscopic\" in the sense that they take into account of individual interactions and the transmission characteristics of this new disease which appears to have arisen first in China. Al-though extremely important for national policy-making involving a multitude of factors, it should be possible to understand the principal qualitative properties of the effects of this pandemic. It is therefore important to have some model which is complementary to the detailed dynamics of the disease epidemiology which helps in accurately parametrising the overall statistical numbers available.",

(3)] that, as kn i (t) grows from some initially small kn i (0), the \"effective growth rate\" [ie,\u03b3 c (1 \u2212 kn i )] keeps reducing and would become zero at a time T max when kn i (T max ) = 1.

If we take the unit of time as a day, anecdotal evidence suggests that in two days, the disease will spread to 2 or 3 individuals. For this reason, \u03b3 c = 0.5 is assumed. The calculation is carried out for a period of 50 days. Keeping these parameters fixed the following values of k * = 0, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 5.0 are considered and two interesting quantities, p i and dp i dt as functions of t are plotted in Figs. 1-5.",

This is T tot . After this, \"infection probability\" does not make sense and the calculation is stopped. Fig. 1B shows a similar behaviour of the infection growth rate. In this case, the two rates are simply proportional to each other as shown by Eq.(5). The proportionality is simply \u03b3 c = 1/2. This is a reference calculation which shows the effect of simply ignoring the disease. Figure 2 demonstrates the effect of choosing k * = 1/2. As discussed earlier, this is less than the 'critical value' k * = 1. It is seen that p i = 1 around 24 days. Remarkably, this sub-critical value of the co-efficient only lengthens the time-scale of the total infection of the population of 1 million individuals (starting with 10 at the start) slightly. However, the infection rate is lower by 50%, relative to the \"do nothing\" scenario. This illustrates that half-measures will not be effective in really controlling the disease and protecting a significant fraction of the population. As before, the calculation stops at the time not substantially different from T tot . Figure 3 shows that when k * = 1, p i keeps rising monotonically and n i (t) always remains less than N 0 . By about 40 days the population does get fully infected. In actual fact, p i (t) < 1, and approaches this value as a limit. This is demonstrable from Eq.(5). In this case, we see that dp i dt has a \"bell-like\" shape with a maximum at 1/8. Contrary to popular belief, the curve is not a Gaussian, nor is it really symmetrical about the maximum. It is, in fact, correctly represented by the formula, Eq.(6). The maximum rate of infection occurs around 24 days. Figure 4 shows the the effect of choosing k * = 3/2, a \"super-critical\" value. This time, p i adopts the classic S [called a \"saturation curve\"] shape as in the critical case. However, p max i = 1/k * , as predicted theoretically from exact solution of Eq.(6). Thus this policy certainly shields 33% of the initial population from the illness. Furthermore, the infection rate curve in Fig. 4B , is certainly \"flattened\" as compared with Fig. 3B . However, the area under it is not equal to the curve in Fig. 2B . In actual fact, it must be 33% smaller as also predicted by the analysis. Figure 5 shows that by having a relatively large k * = 5.0, one can shield nearly 80% of population and really flatten the infection rate curve. This should not cause any surprise since k * p i reaches unity by about 25 days. After that, the effective growth rate, \u0393 eff < 0.",

The model, as stated, does not account for mortality as a result of infection. To represent this, one needs to introduce, the probability that an individual would die after infection. If we set n d (t) for number of deaths due to the infection, and assume a mean probability of deaths equal to n d /n i (t) = r d \u2264 1, we can calculate n d after obtaining n i as described earlier. It is known that this probability varies with many factors and is certainly not the same for all age groups[1]. We can follow the distribution of (p i (t)) among different age groups by introducing the distribution function, f i (y, t) where, y is the age of the person. It is clear that ,",

Conversely, if k * decreases as a function of time, the rate of spreading will necessarily increase. If the variation with time is complicated (such as a 'step function'), the equation can still be solved over every 'interval of constancy' and the overall solution obtained numerically by continuing the solutions across the boundary points of each interval. As is characteristic of any phenomenological model, the parameters such as \u03b3 c , k * , p i (0) have to be empirically obtained. Thus available data can be used to estimate such model parameters. More detailed epidemiological statistical models will certainly be needed to obtain such parameters from 'first principles'. An analogy from Physics may be relevant here: just as Thermodynamics describes matter in a gross, phenomenological manner and has to be supplemented by detailed molecular models to relate its results to fundamental physical principles (eg. Classical or Quantum Statistical Mechanics/Kinetics).

Thus \u03c4 is the measure of time in terms of the \"growth time\" 1/\u03b3 c , characteristic of the disease. It is easily related to the observed rates of the disease (with some errors due to inadequate testing etc). We find then that Eq.(5) becomes, when written in the new variables,We obtain from this,We can express this in terms of the original variables to get a feel for the character of the solution and some of its key properties.Thus, it is clear that at t = 0, p i (0) = p max i x 0 and as t \u2192 \u221e, p i (t) \u2192 p max i = 1 k * . Since p i (t) is manifestly increasing function of t, we see that 1 k * p i (t) < p max i < 1.We next examine when the rate of new infections defined as dp i dt is a maximum. Evidently, this will occur at a time \u03c4 peak , when d 2 p i dt 2 = 0 From Eq.(9) this happens when t satisfies,which implies the relation, 1 \u2212 2 c 0 exp \u03b3 c t 1+c 0 exp \u03b3 c t = 0, precisely the condition p i (t) = p max i /2",
