Various conditions appeared: spiking fever, transient interstitial pneumonitis, transient proteinuria, severe synovitis of the knees and ankles, sensori-neural deafness and confusion (not explained by encephalic MRI and cerebrospinal fluid examination), together with a flare-up of features typical of Kawasaki disease, particularly an infected pharynx together with strawberry tongue, severe cheilitis ( Fig. S1 ; see the supplementary material associated with this article online), cervical lymphadenopathy, and desquamation of the feet and hands which had started periungually (Fig. S2) .

Indeed, this examination showed no uptake, in the spine, pelvic girdle, heels, heart and kidneys, despite ongoing inflammatory pain in the back and a chronic elevation of C-reactive protein levels (from 60 to 300 mg/l). The patient was then discharged. However, after two further infusions of IVIG, the patient reported another bout of inflammatory pain in the heels, sacroiliac areas and along the entire spine, associated with a polymorphous rash (without vasculitis on biopsy) and severe conjunctivitis. The CRP value was still very high (373 mg/l). A strong uptake of the radionuclide in the patient's heels and feet (Fig. 1) was evident on the bone scan, and an MRI scan confirmed enthesitis of the Achilles tendon insertion in both heels, as well as definite inflammation of the sacroiliac joints. Gastric and sigmoid endoscopies were unremarkable, with no features to suggest Whipple's disease. Indeed, macrophage infiltration, or periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)-positive macrophages were not observed in the intestinal mucosa. As IVIGs had become less effective over the last six months, a coronarography was carried out to search for silent aneurysms in heart arteries. This examination showed diffuse aneurysms in coronary arteries, and renal arteriography also identified several micro-aneurysms in both kidneys. Rituximab (500 mg every two weeks for three weeks) was ineffective. As the hemodynamic status of the patient worsened, thalidomide was discussed. However, nephritic syndrome was observed and heart failure finally led to the patient's death, despite a final infusion of IGIV and the use of cyclophosphamide intravenous.",

Imaging was not consistent with the diagnosis of HLA-B27-negative spondylarthropathy (including TEP-scan), until the bone scan. The MRI scan clearly confirmed the presence of severe enthesitis in both heels and bilateral sacroiliitis, two months before the patient's death. This had not been described previously, but transient sacroiliitis has been reported once in a self-limiting association of symptoms suggestive of Kawasaki disease in a young (23-year-old) Spanish male [6] .",

However, as neither uveitis, nor inflammatory disorder of the digestive tract or psoriasis could be identified, this type of rheumatism may somewhat differ from classic HLA-B27-positive ankylosing spondylitis. Accordingly, the use of IVIGs should not be advocated, based on this single case, in treating other forms of spondylarthropathy that do not respond to TNF-blockers.",

Also, a better understanding of Kawasaki disease physiopathology may reveal unexpected mechanisms that also lead to chronic inflammatory pain of the back, sacroiliac, and heels, observed in most spondylarthropathies. The clearance of a so far unrecognized pathogen that might have triggered spondylarthropathy and Kawasaki disease could be one explanation [7] . However, extensive searches for other pathogens were negative in our patient, including PCR analyses for coronaviruses [8] , despite the presence of hepatosplenomegaly and lymph node enlargement (complicated twice by a painful lymph node necrosis).",
