            "text": "N95 masks were recommended by the CDC and WHO for healthcare workers caring for suspected or confirmed SARS patients. These are generally used to protect against highly transmissible respiratory infections such as tuberculosis. \u2018N\u2019 stands for NIOSH \u2013 the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health of the USA, and \u201895\u2019 indicates its filter efficiency. Hence, the mask is 95% efficient at filtering out particles of size 300 nm and above. The SARS coronavirus is 100 nm in size, but when expelled from patients, is usually larger because it is enveloped in saliva as droplets. The masks are made of polypropylene fabric, using a nonwoven technology that increases the density and filtering function (4). The most common adverse reaction reported to the N95 mask was acne, and this has 2 plausible explanations. First, a hot and humid microclimate is created in regions of the face covered by the mask, which predisposes to a flare\u2010up of acne. Secondly, occlusion of pilosebaceous ducts due to local pressure on the skin from the close\u2010fitting mask could result in a flare\u2010up of acne (5). Itch and rash were reported frequently as well with most cases probably due to irritant contact dermatitis from components of the mask. True allergic contact dermatitis may occur to adhesives used in the masks or to mask components such as rubber straps or metal clips. Patch testing would be necessary to determine the true incidence of such cases. As for the 8 cases who reported pigmentation with mask use, a possible cause is postinflammatory hyperpigmentation or perhaps even pigmented contact dermatitis. A few patients also suffered from pressure\u2010related effects of mask use, as illustrated by answers such as \u2018scar at nosebridge\u2019 and \u2018redness of nosebridge\u2019 in the questionnaires.",

            "text": "Skin reactions to gloves included complaints of dry skin, itch, and rash. Type I immunoglobulin E\u2010mediated natural rubber latex hypersensitivity is an important, often undiagnosed, occupational health hazard for healthcare workers, especially in those with high exposure. Rates of sensitization ranging from 3% to 17% have been reported in the west. The most common clinical manifestations include contact urticaria, presenting with pruritus, erythema and/or wheals, eczematous lesions, rhinitis, and occupational asthma. In a recent study conducted in Singapore, a prevalence rate of latex sensitization of 9.6% was reported among healthcare workers (6). Latex sensitization could explain the symptoms reported by some individuals in our study, while a more likely explanation could be the increased frequency of hand\u2010washing and exposure to soaps by healthcare staff, resulting in an irritant contact dermatitis of the hands. As would be expected, few respondents reported adverse skin reactions with the use of gowns.",

To the best of our knowledge, this has not been described elsewhere in the dermatological literature. It is important to note, however, that the reported skin reactions could not be verified and documented by investigators, but were purely based on the subjective assessment of the healthcare staff themselves. In addition, we were unable to determine the severity of the skin reactions through the self\u2010administered questionnaires although it would be reasonable to conclude that most reactions were of mild to moderate severity as most staff continued to use the equipment and few sought formal treatment with a physician. This study nonetheless provides an insight into the frequency of dermatological problems, which could arise from prolonged use of PPE. No doubt that the threat of SARS is presently contained in the world, but no one can say what other new contagion may emerge and thus such information may prove useful to the dermatological community in the future.",
