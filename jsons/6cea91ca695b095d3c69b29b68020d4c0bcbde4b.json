Strains of C difficile can produce a number of toxins, but the enterotoxin designated Toxin A and the cytotoxin designated Toxin B are the best understood. CDAD is diagnosed on detection of these 2 toxins in feces. 10 Not all strains of C difficile produce toxins, and a small percentage of normal humans and animals can carry toxigenic strains without production of toxins and development of disease. 10, 16 Therefore, bacterial culture is not adequate for the diagnosis of CDAD, but it can be useful for epidemiologic purposes.",

Fifteen dogs were resident animals, 7 were research animals, and 71 were privately owned. Samples (1-8; mean 1.85, median 1) from each animal were evaluated. The age of affected File # 17em animals ranged from 1 to 18 years (5.7 \u03ee 3.7, mean \u03ee SD). Overall, C difficile toxins were detected in 1 or more fecal samples from 48 of 93 (52%) dogs. Seven of the 48 (15%) dogs developed CDAD after discharge from the hospital. Co-infection with other enteropathogens was identified uncommonly in C difficile toxin-positive dogs ( Table  1) . Electron microscopy and virus isolation were performed on fecal samples from 21 randomly selected dogs (11 from CDAD dogs and 10 from non-CDAD dogs). Potentially clinically relevant findings were present in 2 dogs. A suspected enterovirus of unknown consequence was identified in a dog with CDAD and a possible coronavirus was identified in the feces of a dog without CDAD. No significant differences (P \u03fd 0.05) in the proportion of dogs undergoing surgery or receiving antimicrobial drugs or chemotherapy were found between dogs with a diagnosis of CDAD and those without. On the basis of the timing of hospitalization and clinical signs, nosocomial infection was suspected in 38 of 48 (79%) CDAD and 31 of 45 (69%) non-CDAD dogs. Only 9 CDAD dogs and 8 non-CDAD dogs had been treated with antimicrobials before the onset of diarrhea. Small sample size precluded analysis of risks associated with different antimicrobials. Only 2 dogs died or were euthanized. Both had CDAD, but death was from unrelated causes in 1 dog. In the 2nd dog, euthanasia was performed because of severe hemorrhagic gastroenteritis and septicemia. Hemorrhagic gastroenteritis was diagnosed in 1 other dog. This dog also tested positive for C difficile but responded to treatment. No other pathogens were identified in either dog with hemorrhagic gastroenteritis.",

A scheduled emergency-only period, set to coincide with the transition between university semesters, was expanded so that elective cases were not admitted for 14 days. Additionally, less critical emergencies were directed to other facilities whenever possible. The dog walking yard was thought to be a potential source of infection because it was a common area that most infected animals had visited, because there was a high likelihood of fecal contamination of the grass and soil, and because teaching dogs also were turned out in an adjacent area. Approximately 20 cm of topsoil was removed and replaced with clean topsoil and sod. A significant decrease (P \u03fd 0.0001) in cases of CDAD occurred after implementation of these measures. During the 26-day period from recognition of the 1st case until partial hospital closure, 30 cases of CDAD were identified, whereas 18 cases were identified in the next 136 days (Fig 1) . A similar decrease in suspected nosocomial cases of CDAD also occurred. Seventeen cases of suspected nosocomial CDAD in client animals out of 893 total canine and feline admissions were identified during the initial period, corresponding to a nosocomial CDAD rate of 19 cases in 1,000 admissions. In the period after the clinic was reopened, 10 cases of nosocomial CDAD were reported out of 3,930 total admissions, with a nosocomial CDAD rate of 2.5 in 1,000 admissions (P \u03fd 0.001).",

            "text": "It is suspected that infection was acquired from the hospital environment in this situation. Despite being poorly aerotolerant in its vegetative form, C difficile can form spores that are highly resistant to disinfectants, 19 and C difficile spores have been detected in the environment of our veterinary hospital and others. 1, 14 Bleach is the most effective environmental disinfectant for C difficile, but it is uncommonly used as a routine disinfectant in veterinary hospitals, in part because it is noxious and caustic. Numbers of C difficile organisms might have increased over time as resistant spores accumulated after being shed by symptomatically and asymptomatically infected animals. These spores then could infect susceptible animals, particularly those receiving antimicrobials or chemotherapeutic agents. It is curious, therefore, that this outbreak started in the group of resident dogs and that intermittent cases of CDAD have continued to occur in these dogs. These dogs are housed in the teaching hospital but have no direct contact with patient animals. A potential source of infection, however, is possible because these dogs walk through parts of the hospital that house clinical patients. They are walked in an area directly adjacent to where clinical patients are walked, and these areas share a common entrance. Previously, we demonstrated that this entrance was heavily contaminated with C difficile spores. 14 On the basis of our understanding of nosocomial C difficile in humans, the resident dogs could have been considered at somewhat lower risk because they had not received antimicrobials, had no history of diet changes or dietary indiscretion, and lived in a stable environment. The reason the resident dogs were affected is not clear, but their lifestyle could be more stressful than is recognized, and they might be exposed continually to C difficile in the environment, creating a possible cumulative effect. One resident dog continued to experience recurrent episodes of CDAD for approximately 6 months and was adopted by a private party. No additional episodes of diarrhea were reported in this dog. It was also unexpected and alarming that some client dogs developed CDAD after discharge and after spending only a few hours in the hospital. The significant decrease in nosocomial CDAD after institution of aggressive infection control procedures suggests that these measures were effective in controlling this apparent outbreak; however, this suggestion is impossible to prove. Such infection control measures are logical on the basis of current understanding of C difficile in veterinary and human medicine and should be considered if further outbreaks of CDAD are encountered in veterinary hospitals.",

This finding was not surprising because C difficile is a strict anaerobe that does not survive well in fecal samples, whereas the toxins are quite stable. 15 Bacterial culture was not performed immediately in all cases because toxin detection is the clinical standard for diagnosis of CDAD. Additionally, once it was recognized that CDAD was the cause of a number of cases of diarrhea, metronidazole often was administered at the 1st sign of clinical disease, sometimes before obtaining a fecal sample. These factors likely contributed to the low isolation rate. Unfortunately, the low isolation rate precluded molecular epidemiologic studies.",
