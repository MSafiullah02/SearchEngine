With high CAP numbers in China and growing access to PICUs, factors associated with severe CAP need to be determined to optimize care. Objective: To prospectively determine PICU CAP admission features and outcomes. Methods: A 4 year prospective study of CAP aged 1 month to <14 years admitted to PICU, Children's Hospital Affiliated to Soochow University, China. All were managed in a standard manner. Clinical, laboratory, and imaging findings were collected systematically. All received antibiotics. Results: Eight hundred ten (7%) of 10,836 CAP hospital admissions needed PICU. Seven hundred seven (87%) were enrolled. PICU CAP children were young (76% 12 months) and 33% had co-morbid conditions; 21% congenital heart disease.21% required mechanical ventilation. The average length of PICU stay was 5 days (range, 3-27). The case fatality rate was 5.8%. Viruses were detected in 38%, RSV 24%; bacteria in 23%, Streptococcus pneumoniae 7%, Haemophilus influenza b 4%, Mycoplasma 11%. On single factor analysis, PICU admission respiratory rate >70/min, grunting/groaning, head nodding, cyanosis, and anemia were associated with respiratory failure and with fatality. On multivariate analysis only presence of congenital heart disease, Trisomy 21 and immunodeficiency correlated with fatality; not microbe nor PICU findings. Conclusions: Young age and underlying congenital heart disease were associated factors for PICU support in CAP in China. Early referral if altered sensorium, high respiratory rate, head nodding, grunting and anemia, and universal access to conjugated vaccines may decrease morbidity and mortality.

Assessment of factors such as overcrowding and air pollution might be helpful to see if these apply in the PICU CAP patients in the same manner as in children hospitalized with CAP. 18, 37 In conclusion, this large cohort study of children with very severe CAP in China has confirmed in a developing country the importance of young age and underlying factors such as congenital heart disease in the most severe cases, that is, those needing PICU support. This study provides yet more evidence on the importance of universal immunization with vaccines against S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae b as recommended by the World Health Organization. Even access to quality PICU support cannot overcome the serious morbidity associated with these bacteria. Prevention is a better option. Countries with emerging economies like India and China need to move forward to provide these two vaccines to all of their children. Beyond this prevention strategy, given the very large numbers of children in China and India and the increasing access to PICUs in many regions early recognition and referral of severe cases may also help to decrease fatalities. More studies are needed to hone best practices for managing pneumonia coming from the community in different developing country settings. This further confirmation that altered sensorium, head nodding and grunting are markers for increased fatality raises the question of whether more training on these markers at the community health worker level can increase recognition and speed of referral for highest risk cases to centers with PICUs.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 624, "end": 628, "text": "[31]", "ref_id": "BIBREF30"}, {"start": 629, "end": 633, "text": "[32]", "ref_id": "BIBREF31"}, {"start": 634, "end": 638, "text": "[33]", "ref_id": "BIBREF32"}, {"start": 639, "end": 643, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 644, "end": 648, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 649, "end": 653, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 692, "end": 696, "text": "[34]", "ref_id": "BIBREF33"}, {"start": 697, "end": 701, "text": "[35]", "ref_id": "BIBREF34"}, {"start": 702, "end": 706, "text": "[36]", "ref_id": "BIBREF35"}, {"start": 1016, "end": 1019, "text": "18,", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 1020, "end": 1022, "text": "37", "ref_id": "BIBREF36"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "DISCUSSION"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF0": {"ref_id": "b0", "title": "Epidemiology and etiology of childhood pneumonia", "authors": [{"first": "I", "middle": [], "last": "Rudan", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "C", "middle": [], "last": "Boschi-Pinto", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "Z", "middle": [], "last": "Biloglav", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "K", "middle": [], "last": "Mulholland", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "H", "middle": [], "last": "Campbell", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2008, "venue": "Bull World Health Organ", "volume": "86", "issn": "", "pages": "408--416", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF1": {"ref_id": "b1", "title": "World Health Organization, The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF)", "authors": [], "year": 2009, "venue": "", "volume": "", "issn": "", "pages": "", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF2": {"ref_id": "b2", "title": "World Economic Outlook Database. 5.
