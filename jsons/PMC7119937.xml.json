Prokaryotes do not have these membranes nor organella. Therefore, existence of membrane systems and organella, particularly mitochondria, are the two major characteristics of eukaryotes. It should be noted that some parasitic eukaryotes lost mitochondria. Genome sizes of eukaryotes became much bigger than those of prokaryotes. Accordingly, gene numbers are also more abundant in eukaryotes than prokaryotes. It is not clear if the formation of nucleus triggered the increase of the genome size.",

Most of bacterial genomes are circular, while all eukaryotic genomes so far known are linear (here organelle genomes are not considered). The main reason for a large genome size in eukaryotes is the existence of many repeat sequences, which are minority in prokaryotes. Pseudogenes and introns are also few in prokaryotic genomes, while both are abundant in eukaryotic genomes. High occurrences of gene duplications in eukaryotes prompted production of many pseudogenes. Horizontal gene transfers are known to be quite frequent in prokaryotes, and they are rare in eukaryotes. Finally, genome duplications sometimes occur in eukaryotes, especially in plants and in vertebrates, but genome duplication is so far not known for prokaryotic genomes.\n",

Although most of vertebrate mitochondrial DNA genomes have the same gene order as in human (Fig. 8.3a), gene order may vary from phylum to phylum. Yet the gene content and the genome size are more or less constant among animals. It is not clear why animal mitochondrial genomes are so small. One possibility is that animal individuals are highly integrated compared to fungi and plants, and this might have influenced a drastic reduction of the mitochondrial genome size. Another interesting feature of animal mitochondrial DNA genomes is the heterogeneous rates of gene order change. For example, platyhelminthes exhibit great variability in mitochondrial gene order (Sakai and Sakaizumi, 2012; [5]).\n\n",

Interestingly, melon mitochondrial genome looks like the vertebrate nuclear genome in its contents, in spite of its genome size being similar to that of bacteria. The protein coding gene region accounted for only 1.7 % of the genome, and about half of the genome is composed of repeats. The remaining part is mostly homologous to melon nuclear DNA, and 1.4 % is homologous to melon chloroplast DNA. Most of the protein coding genes of melon mitochondrial DNAs are highly similar to those of its congeneric species, which are watermelon and squash whose mitochondrial genome sizes are 119 kb and 125 kb, respectively. This indicates that the huge expansion of its genome size occurred only recently. Interestingly, cucumber (Cucumis sativus), another congeneric species, also has ~1.8-Mb mitochondrial genome with many repeat sequences [9]. It will be interesting to study whether the increase of mitochondrial genomes of melon and cucumber is independent or not.",

Later, a subset of the S subfamily were found to be highly similar with each other, and they were named as Y after \u2018young,\u201d for they appeared relatively in young or recent age. Rough estimates of the divergence time of Alu elements are as follows: J subfamily appeared about 60 million years ago, and S subfamily separated from J at 44 million years ago, followed by further separation of Y at 32 million years ago [32].

In contrast, viruses whose genomes contain only a handful of genes have small genome sizes. Therefore, their possibility of genome evolution is rather limited. Even if amino acid sequences are rapidly changing because of high mutation rates, the protein function may not change. Unless the gene number and genome size increase, viruses cannot evolve their genome structures. It is thus clear that the increase of the genome size is crucial to produce the diversity of organisms. However, genomes often contain DNA regions which are not indispensable. Organisms with large genome sizes have many such junk DNA regions. Because of their existence, the genome size and the gene number are not necessarily highly correlated. This phenomenon was historically called C-value paradox (e.g., [48]), after the constancy of the haploid DNA amount for one species was found, yet their values were found to vary considerably among species at around 1950 (e.g., [49\u201351]). \u201cC-value\u201d is the amount of haploid DNA, and C probably stands as acronym of \u201cconstant\u201d or \u201cchromosomes.\u201d We now know that the majority of eukaryote genome DNA is junk, and there is no longer a paradox in C-values among species.",

Now it is becoming clear that at least some noncoding regions play important roles in gene regulation (e.g., Carroll 2005; [55]).

If we exclude these four outlier species, a good linear regression is obtained, as shown in Fig. 8.9. This straight line indicates that in average, one gene size corresponds to 2.9 kb in a typical fungi genome. If we apply this average gene size to the truffle genome, its genome size should be ~22 Mb, but the real size is 103 Mb larger. This suggests that there is unusually large number of junk DNA in this genome. In fact, 58 % of its genome consists of transposable elements [81]. The truffle genome must still have 24 % more junk DNA region. Gain and loss of genes in each branch of the phylogenetic tree for fungi species are shown in Fig. 8.10 (based on [81]).

Interestingly, Cnidaria, Platyhelminthes, and Urochordata lack the ZOC domain, and their ZF-BC domain sequences are quite diverged compared to Arthropoda, Mollusca, Annelida, Echinodermata, and Chordata. This distribution suggests that the Zic family genes with the entire set of the three conserved domains already existed in the common ancestor of bilateralian animals, and some of them may be lost in parallel in the platyhelminthes, nematodes, and urochordates [88].

There are 22,227 protein coding genes in C. elegans including 2,575 alternatively spliced forms, with 79 % confirmed to be transcribed at least partially. The number of tRNA genes is 608, and 274 are located in X chromosome. The three kinds of rRNA genes (18S, 5.8S, and 26S) are located in chromosome I in 100\u2013150 tandem repeats, while ~100 5S rRNA genes are also in tandem form but located in chromosome V. The average protein coding gene length is 3 kb, with the average of 6.4 coding exons per gene. In total, protein coding exons constitute 25.6 % of the whole genome. Figure 8.13 shows the distribution of the protein coding genes, and Fig. 8.14 the distribution of exon numbers per gene. Both distributions have long tails. The median sizes of exons and introns are 123 bp and 65 bp, respectively. Intron lengths of C. elegans are quite short compared to these of vertebrate genes (see 10.1007/978-1-4471-5304-7_9). The distribution of protein coding genes varies depending on chromosomes, slightly more dense for five autosomes than X chromosome and more dense in the central region than the edge of one chromosome. Processed, i.e., intronless, pseudogenes are rare, and a total of 561 pseudogenes were reported at the Wormbase version WS133. About half of them are homologous to functional chemoreceptor genes.\n\n",

Megavirus, parasitic to amoeba, has 1.26-Mb genome size and there are 1,120 protein coding genes [100]. Megavirus is phylogenetically close to mimivirus [101], a member of nucleoplasmic large DNA viruses, including pox virus. Recently, a larger genome size virus, Pandoravirus, with more than 2.5-Mb genome, was discovered [105]. The phylogenetic status of these large genome size DNA viruses is unknown at this moment.",
