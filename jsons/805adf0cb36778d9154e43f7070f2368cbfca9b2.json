The virus has been named SARS-CoV-2 and the disease it causes \"coronavirus disease 2019\" (COVID-19). 1,2 Community transmission is now evident, and it is clear that SARS-CoV-2 is a highly contagious virus. 3, 4 The spectrum of disease ranges from severe respiratory illness and fatality from these complications (particularly in the elderly and those with comorbidities) to asymptomatic spread, 1, 5, 6 with the proclivity of SARS-CoV-2 for person-to-person transmission in asymptomatic individuals presenting one of the most vexing problems from a public health standpoint. 1 Given the rapid and pervasive spread, the World Health Organization declared SARS-CoV-2 a pandemic on March 11, 2020 , and on March 13, 2020 , the president of the United States declared a national emergency in the United States, consistent with similar actions taken in several other countries 7, 8 (Figure 1 ).",

In the presence of a highly contagious global pandemic, decisions will need to be considered regarding the short-term rationing of services, keeping a perspective that many allergy/immunology services are elective and can be managed without face-to-face interaction, or deferred outright for short periods of time. This is prefaced by stating that such measures would be for emergency purposes only, such as at the present time, where the US president has declared a national state of emergency. 8 As COVID-19 becomes more pervasive, recommended and mandated social distancing becomes more pronounced. Several countries have initiated widespread quarantine measures to try to contain and mitigate the spread of SARS-CoV-2. During a pandemic where a national state of emergency has been declared and quarantine measures are recommended or mandated, \"red zone\" measures must be considered. 2,7,8 A helpful view of a stratified approach is presented in Figure 2 . Much of what follows relates to \"red zone\" operations. Some of the suggestion below may be most appropriate for a greater level of social distancing and quarantine than exists in the moment, and, as such, the clinician must view these as conditional recommendations to be incorporated within contextspecific, evolving situations. Again, we want to ensure that all readers understand that this is a suggested framework, and furthermore a framework only to be considered in the setting of a global emergency during a time when nations, societies, and institutions are facing drastic pandemic measures in a \"red zone\" situation. Ultimately, any decision to reduce or shift service resides within the sole autonomy of the clinician, their practice, their health care system, and their community.",

The virus has been named SARS-CoV-2 and the disease it causes \"coronavirus disease 2019\" (COVID-19). 1,2 China first notified the World Health Organization of several cases of a human respiratory illness that were linked to an open seafood and livestock market in the city of Wuhan in December 2019, which appears to have originated in chrysanthemum bats. 1,3 Worldwide community transmission is now evident, and it is clear that SARS-CoV-2 is a highly contagious virus. 3 Cases have been identified across the globe, and on 1 cruise ship alone more than 700 infections were reported, demonstrating the high level of potential contagion. 1, 4 The spectrum of disease ranges from severe respiratory illness and fatality from these complications (particularly in the elderly and those with comorbidities) to asymptomatic spread, 1, 5, 6 with the proclivity of SARS-CoV-2 for person-to-person transmission in asymptomatic individuals presenting one of the most vexing problems from a public health standpoint. 1 Of note, based on data at the time of drafting this document, serious illness appears to occur in approximately 14% to 16% of cases. 2,6 However, we cannot stress enough that these are fluid situations that may change hourly. Given the rapid and pervasive spread, the World Health Organization declared SARS-CoV-2 a public health emergency of international concern on January 30, 2020, and a pandemic on March 11, 2020, and on March 13, 2020, the president of the United States declared a national emergency in the United States, consistent with similar actions taken in several other countries. 7, 8 Information is sparse in some instances, and inconsistent in others, but there is anticipated widespread caseload across the North America and an urgent need to match the pace of the outbreak to the capacity of national health care systems to serve the needs of affected individuals in an urgent and timely manner ( Figure 1 ). It is incumbent on each physician to monitor the day-to-day evolution of the pandemic in their region, and to be prepared to implement the recommendations of authorities and experts. The situation is changing quickly and requires a rapid, flexible, and informed response.",

It is important to note that many allergy/ immunology services are elective and can be managed without face-to-face interaction or deferred outright for short periods of time. Not only will these considerations be important for patient health and safety, but it will also be important to consider those health care workers who are within the high-risk group as specified by the CDC. A strong argument can be made that we must diligently protect our workforce by realigning present priorities to limit face-to-face patient interactions where possible, particularly for health care workers. 12 Relevant, though admittedly 16-year-old, data from a US allergy/immunology 2004 survey found that the average age of the allergy and immunology physician workforce was 53 years in 2004 versus 51 years in 1999, with physicians working longer before retiring. 12 To provide an approach to triaging allergy/immunology services during the COVID-19 pandemic, a consensus-based ad-hoc expert panel of allergy/immunology specialists from the United States and Canada developed a service and patient prioritization schematic to temporarily adjust allergy/immunology services. Recommendations and feedback were developed iteratively, using an adapted modified Delphi methodology to achieve consensus.",

The decree cancelled sporting events and public gatherings and closed schools, universities, and recreational facilities through April 3. 13 On March 13, France announced plans to close nonessential businesses and Spain announced a nationwide lockdown. 14 Currently throughout North America, there have already been widespread cancellations and postponements of large gatherings, including most major sporting events and leagues.",

            "text": "Telehealth can be central in delivering allergy/immunology services within a risk-stratified context of the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic. Telehealth has the potential to help with social distancing. Several advantages that telehealth offers are as follows: (1) it can limit exposure of providers to potentially infected patients, particularly if they are older or have health problems, (2) it can reduce exposure of patients, many of whom have conditions such as asthma or immunodeficiency disorders, to other infected patients, and (3) it can provide access to rapid evaluation for potential COVID-19 infection, reducing the likelihood that they will go to an urgent care clinic or emergency department where they have increased risk of virus exposure. To provide telehealth services to patients it is important to remember that the provider must be licensed to practice medicine in the state where the patient is located (although some regulations are in flux during the national emergency). Please see this article's Online Repository at www.jaci-inpractice.org for additional information on telehealth. [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] The American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology and the American College of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology telemedicine/telehealth toolkits can be valuable resources. 17, 24 Although telehealth may be a valuable and critical resource, challenges will include triaging patient diagnoses and severity to provide immediate access to services to patients with more acute need. [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] For example, a patient requiring assessment of possible idiopathic anaphylaxis would likely require more immediate access to this service than a patient needing follow-up for well-controlled asthma or allergic rhinitis. In other circumstances discussed below, patients with well-controlled allergic disease may be able to appropriately defer both face-to-face and telehealth visits. Clinicians will also need to be aware of potential pitfalls of virtual care. For example, the case of unstable asthma in a patient with poor perception of dyspnea or during a significant exacerbation. However, telehealth can also be an excellent tool for many allergic conditions for those with less severe and stable conditions, such as in those with seasonal allergies who need a brief reassessment and refill of their prescriptions before their allergy season. In the current context, especially if formal telehealth services are not available, virtual care may also need to be dispensed using telephone, electronic medical record patient portal messaging, and e-visits, including in the event of absolute emergencies. For many situations, incorporating phone triage as a first step may be helpful, particularly in areas where the clinical situation may lack clarity as to the acuity or pressing need for the patient to be seen, and then working toward maximizing telehealth or other means of virtual care where social distancing can be preserved and health care needs can still be met. This document seeks to provide a rationale to be considered for such instances.",

Asthma is a major health problem around the globe. 30 Because SARS-CoV-2 is a respiratory pathogen, it is important to know what risk patients with asthma have in this time of a COVID-19 pandemic. There are relatively few data at this time to demonstrate a specific increased risk for COVID-19 from asthma, or an increased disease pathology in patients with asthma infected with SARS-CoV-2. However, this association could evolve. Early published data from China noted that asthma was not a strong risk factor for severe COVID-19 disease. One study of 140 patients with COVID-19 found none with asthma, 31 and in a larger study of 1099 hospitalized patients, asthma was not described. 32 In this larger study, chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD) was noted in patients hospitalized with COVID-19, but the rate of patients with COPD who had COVID-19 (1.1%) was lower than the rate of COPD in the general Chinese population (which is at least 10%). 33 Data from Korea also indicate that asthma is not a relevant comorbidity. 10 Together these data suggest that the risk of severe COVID-19 may not be dramatically elevated in those with asthma or COPD. However, these data are based on hospitalized patients and may have significant limitations due to selection and reporting bias. It is also important to note that asthma appears underdiagnosed and underreported in China, with an estimated prevalence of only 4.2%. 34 The actual risk of disease in those with asthma or COPD within the broader Chinese population or those of non-Chinese background is not known, and may evolve with additional data reporting.",

Currently, the World Health Organization and the CDC recommend that in the general population with COVID-19, systemic corticosteroids should be avoided because of a potential for prolonged viral replication that was observed in patients with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus. However, there is also acknowledgment that there may be a role for systemic corticosteroids when indicated for other reasons, such as septic shock. 2,37-39 For example, in a study of 309 intensive care unit patients with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, 151 received corticosteroids acutely, and those who received corticosteroids were more likely to receive mechanical ventilation (93.4% vs 76.6%; P < .0001), had higher 90-day crude mortality (74.2% vs 57.6%; P \u00bc .002), and had delayed viral clearance. Of note, mortality rates did not differ by corticosteroid use when adjusted by time-varying confounders. 38 Approximately 20% to 30% of hospitalized patients with COVID-19 have pneumonia and may require intensive care for respiratory support 2,39 ; thus, it is important to appreciate that corticosteroids may have distinct roles in treating lung injury versus airway inflammation. Recently, Russel et al 40 summarized current evidence in relation to the use of corticosteroids for mitigating lung injury from coronaviruses and concluded that there is likely to be a lack of efficacy in COVID-19 lung injury.",

            "text": "However, it is important to differentiate between the use of corticosteroids for the treatment of COVID-19 and their use as a controller medication for the management of a chronic disease, such as asthma. As mentioned, it is most important to maintain asthma control, and the lack of patients with comorbid asthma being noted in COVID-19 studies or data reporting suggests that patients with asthma may not be at a greatly increased risk of more serious disease-even with the use of inhaled corticosteroids as part of a controller regimen. In fact, it may be more likely that a patient with asthma would have an exacerbation from other causes, including seasonal pollen exposure or a virus other than SARS-CoV-2 if they stopped regular use of indicated controller therapy based on best evidence. An exacerbation could require them to enter the health care system, which would put them at increased risk of being exposed to SARS-CoV-2 during the current pandemic. Until studies in patients with asthma with SARS-CoV-2 have been performed and show evidence to the contrary, a prudent recommendation would be to continue to manage asthma according to current asthma guidelineebased recommendations. 30 Of note, nebulizer use is discouraged unless essential during this pandemic, because the use of nebulized therapy is more likely to aerosolize SARS-CoV-2 and increase the risk of contagion. As such, asthma therapy delivered by metered dose inhaler would be most appropriate both in the health care setting and at home. [41] [42] [43] Methodologically sound and high-quality evidence supports the administration of a number of biologic agents-targeting IL-5, IL-4/ IL-13, and IgE-for appropriately selected patients with refractory moderate to severe persistent asthma. 43 There is no evidence that suggests that immune response to COVID-19 will be impaired in patients with asthma treated with antieIL-5, antieIL-5Ra, antieIL-4/IL-13, or anti-IgE medications. In the absence of any data indicating a potential for harm, it would be reasonable to continue administration of biologic agents during the COVID-19 pandemic in patients for whom such agents are clearly indicated and have been effective. 44, 45 In summary, understanding of the intersection between asthma and COVID-19 is evolving. There are currently scant data to indicate the degree of risk (or protection) from disease, and no data to support strong recommendations for or against specific asthma treatments. Until more information suggests otherwise, it is strongly recommended that physicians continue to manage asthma according to existing accepted asthma guidelines. 30 Ensuring that those with asthma have their condition under optimal control is the best deterrent against a poor outcome from any viral respiratory tract infection, and there is a high likelihood that this recommendation also extends to SARS-CoV-2.",

Therefore, with rare exception (or \"unless there are extenuating circumstances\"), service reduction for allergic rhinitis would be strongly recommended as pandemic management and isolation measures continue to escalate. Although telehealth and phone triage do remain as available options, telehealth utilization comes with the caveat that other diagnoses may need these limited resources with higher priority. Skin testing to inhalants may not be appropriate; it may be prudent to postpone such testing or to perform in vitro serum specific IgE testing as an alternative, with the understanding that this would also entail entering a health care environment for performance of phlebotomy.

Consider use of virtual care resources. 2) Consider prioritizing the care of high-risk patients, as defined by the CDC/WHO in the particular epidemic, over other groups. COVID-19 infection, from the currently available information, appears to have a milder course and less aggressive attack rate in children, including children with asthma. 3) For patients with asthma of any severity who are exhibiting worsening control or an acute exacerbation, follow COVID-19 screening protocols to determine their risks of COVID-19 infection and need for COVID-19 testing at a designated facility (Figure 3 ). If their exacerbation is mild and can be managed by virtual care, this is encouraged. If the exacerbation is more than mild, COVID-19 risk must be considered in determining whether a face-to-face visit is necessary, and what location (office vs ED with negative pressure rooms available if the patient will be undergoing an aerosolgenerating procedure) is most appropriate. 2 If the allergy/immunology office does not have currently recommended personal protective equipment available, it would be recommended that no patients with a copotential for an asthma exacerbation and COVID-19 be seen at that office; the patient should instead be seen at another facility capable of COVID-19 isolation that is also staffed and equipped to assess and manage asthma. 4) Postpone face-to-face routine follow-up visits with any patients with mild to moderate or well-controlled asthma. Consider virtual care options for these patients, including telehealth, to ensure that there is continuity of care. 5) Postpone all face-to-face visits for patients with asthma of any severity who have been well-controlled in the past 6-12 mo, including no record of ED visits, who have had 1 oral steroid bursts or hospitalizations in the immediate 6 mo, or 2 exacerbations in the past year. Use virtual care options to make sure they have an adequate supply of asthma medications and to dispense care if entering into a time of year where the patient typically struggles with control. 6) Prioritize virtual care to assess patients with asthma of any severity who have required ED care or been hospitalized for an exacerbation within the past 3-6 mo, have received 2 oral steroid courses in the past 3-6 mo, or have required 1 dose escalations/additions of any daily controller medication in the past 3-6 mo. 7) Suspend screening of any patient for entry into asthma clinical trials. 8) For patients currently in a research protocol, follow directions of the sponsor, and consider using virtual care resources as permitted.",

Allergen immunotherapy and biologic therapy are valued treatment options for the care of many allergic/immunologic disorders. 47 However, in some cases they represent alternatives to other front-line medical management, and in some settings are a preference-sensitive care option as a firstline therapy. For specific recommendations on service reduction for immunotherapy and biologics, please see Table II. Food allergy, food protein induced enterocolitis syndrome, eosinophilic esophagitis, drug allergy, and anaphylaxis. For specific recommendations on service reduction for food allergy, food protein induced enterocolitis syndrome, eosinophilic esophagitis, drug allergy, and anaphylaxis, please see Table III . Many patients with food allergy, eosinophilic esophagitis, and anaphylaxis are generally healthy, with the exception of other allergic comorbidities such as asthma, allergic rhinitis, or eczema. With limited exception, most of the care of these conditions would reasonably qualify under temporarily nonessential ambulatory elective services, which could be delayed or deferred in the short-to intermediate-term (a few weeks to even a few months) with no anticipated significant serious untoward effects. Most of the care for patients with these conditions could forego any face-to-face visits in the short-term, and if necessary be addressed through virtual care until the pandemic subsides. Many such patients could likely forego any care in this time interval. When considering what is critically necessary, routine food allergy follow-up visits and many new referrals should be considered to fall under a more elective category, where such visits could be handled via telehealth, potentially. Food challenges, with limited exceptions, would also follow suit. In the setting of a pandemic with quarantine measures, unless there is a critical acute nutritional need for introduction of a key nutrient, it is likely that all food challenges would be deferred. Research visits for ongoing study protocols and food allergy immunotherapy visits for initiation and escalation could also be delayed, with the possible exception of food challenge visits at the end of a study interval where delay would risk influencing the primary/secondary outcomes. However, sponsors are likely issuing their own directives for handling this, which should be followed unless the local facility issues guidance that supersedes that of the sponsor with regard to access to space or staff. Where possible, it is recommended that there be planning to provide telehealth visits without testing to provide essential diagnostic management and make medication adjustments, or a plan to address this through phone triage.",

If this is not available or possible, then in-office initiation can occur, preferably with a maximum of 1-2 visits and then transition to home administration in the overwhelming majority of cases, unless there are unusual circumstances or if this is not feasible. 50 Although omalizumab has been approved in Europe for home administration after uneventful administration of 4 doses in clinic, currently home administration of omalizumab in the United States would represent a departure from usual care, and, as such, risks and benefits should be clearly discussed and informed consent documented. 44,45 7) For patients on maintenance doses of biologics, consider converting the patient to a prefilled syringe for potential home administration if this is available (home administration was recently shown to be safe and cost-effective for antieIL-5 and anti-IgE therapy 50 ), vs the risk/benefit of missing 1 or several doses. However, some patients may need to be seen face-to-face for biologic administration, which underscores the need for resource prioritization as outlined above.",

Examples may include milk or soy FPIES or EoE cases or where either formula is being considered as the alternative source and there is strong parental preference to not change to elemental formula; concern for hydrolysate tolerance in a milk-allergic infant; or cases where there is highly suspected milk/soy allergy misdiagnosis that is resulting in such formula being withheld and there is an urgency for directly supervised reintroduction. Elemental formulas could also be empirically considered. b) Other critical essential grains/nutrients in an infant that have been unnecessarily withheld because of suspected misdiagnosis and there is an urgency for directly supervised reintroduction secondary to nutritional concern. c) Introduction of a common essential nutrient/food in a noninfant with widespread avoidance and there is an urgency for directly supervised reintroduction, such as a G-tubeefed child where a change from an elemental to other nutrient-based food is necessary due to nutritional concern. d) Critical concern that peanut has been withheld unnecessarily in a high-risk infant for the purposes of early introduction, and supervised introduction is needed because of previously identified peanut sensitization. e) Drug allergy patient where there is an urgent or critical need for drug allergy delabeling, challenge, or desensitization. f) Vaccine challenge in any immunocompromised individual. g) This would imply that, until pandemic response measures are removed, the following challenges are considered elective and be deferred (or in some instances considered for telehealth): All baked milk or egg challenges. Elective early allergen introduction in any nonehigh-risk infant (consider telehealth). Introduction of peanut, tree nut, or seed where the child is sensitized to 1 or more of these items, but has not ever ingested these previously, and testing was motivated by known/suspected allergy to another tree nut or seed and the item was previously withheld or not introduced. This infers that any challenges to confirm tolerance for cross-reactivity will be deferred in the interim. Reintroduction of noncritical nutrients in children tested for food allergy secondary to eczema, where the food has been avoided for more than 2 y, starting in infancy (consider telehealth). Reintroduction of foods being avoided for EoE (consider telehealth). Routine reintroduction to establish tolerance for outgrown IgE-mediated food allergy or FPIES. Evaluation of children referred with food sensitization drawn as a panel and/or in the absence of a specific history suggesting symptomatic ingestion, including testing done for the evaluation of atopic dermatitis (consider telehealth). Nonemergent drug challenges for the purposes of delabeling where there is no immediate plan for administration in the next 30 d. Vaccine challenges in any immunocompetent individual. 2) We recommend suspending the routine advice on allergy action plans to seek emergency care/call 911 after epinephrine use, unless symptoms do not immediately resolve without recurrence after a single dose of epinephrine. 51 3) The following should be strongly considered with regard to routine allergy visits: a) Postpone any return visits where the patient has been seen within the previous 12-18 mo and there has been no interim history of reaction or suspicion of new food allergy (consider telehealth). b) Postpone any new patient visit not involving suspected IgE-mediated allergy to the common 8 foods plus seed or FPIES or any EoE visits for the purposes of dietary elimination testing (could defer to GI guidance about the need for new or routine endoscopic evaluation of possible EoE, but suggest that this be postponed; consider telehealth). c) Postpone any face-to-face new or return patient visit for suspected allergic proctocolitis (consider telehealth). d) Postpone any new or return drug/vaccine reaction visits or evaluations where re-administration is not anticipated in the next 6 mo (consider telehealth). e) Postpone any second opinion or transfer of care where the patient has or has had another allergist, or visits from out-of-region patients (consider telehealth). f) Postpone new-onset, nonrecurrent idiopathic anaphylaxis evaluations (consider telehealth). Recurrent idiopathic anaphylaxis should be prioritized to telehealth or face-to-face evaluation. 4) Defer initiation and updosing of any food immunotherapy treatment. All patients should be held at their current dose until normal services resume.",

Such patients may need laboratory workup for hereditary angioedema. Much of the visit could be conducted via virtual care, with orders placed for phlebotomy as appropriate (if available). 2) For patients with established hereditary angioedema under good control without any remarkable episodes in the past 6 mo, it would be in their best health care interest to be managed by virtual care. 3) Visits for new onset of lesser severity of angioedema can be postponed (consider telehealth). 4) Visits for new evaluation of chronic urticaria can be postponed, with referring physicians given instructions to start the patient on every-day-twice-a-day dosing of potent nonsedating antihistamines (eg, cetirizine, fexofenadine, or loratadine), according to best evidence, pending resolution of the COVID-19 pandemic. 52 Evidence suggests that laboratory testing can be postponed or deferred in most patients with chronic spontaneous urticaria. 53, 54 Patients with refractory urticaria could be considered for telehealth or a face-to-face visit to recommend further evaluation and management, including initiation of omalizumab in properly selected patients. 55 5) Face-to-face visits for ongoing evaluation of established chronic urticaria can be deferred, in particular if this condition has been well controlled in the past 6 mo, and issues or medication adjustments can be handled through phone triage or telehealth. 6) For new evaluation of atopic dermatitis, severity of the illness as assessed by the referring physician should be strongly considered. Visits for mild atopic dermatitis evaluation may be deferred and the patient managed with topical corticosteroids under the direction of the referring provider. A recommendation to escalate potency within a certain range of topical corticosteroids can be provided. For moderate atopic dermatitis, consider telehealth evaluation. For severe disease, in particular in an infant or in a patient with extensive body surface area involvement and a history of superinfection, face-to-face visits may be necessary and should receive priority over any other patient with atopic dermatitis. For return patient visits for atopic dermatitis, the same general principles apply, with extended consideration for the use of telehealth in the more severe patients who have demonstrated improvement in lieu of face-to-face visits. 7) In the context of atopic dermatitis without a history of acute food reaction, food allergy screening should be deferred. No skin or serologic allergy testing evaluation without a discernable, probable food trigger is advised, given this is low yield and represents a poor prioritization of services. 56-60 8) Initiation of biologic therapy for atopic dermatitis should be weighed very carefully but remains a viable option because this is administered at home and requires limited face-to-face supervision.

It is particularly important for patients known to have T-cell immunodeficiency, athymia, or SCID to seek medical care immediately on presentation of symptoms (fever, cough). 2) Monitoring for infections other than SARS-CoV-2 is required. Immunodeficiency patients may have a myriad of infections other than SARS-CoV-2 (such as liver abscesses, osteomyelitis, meningitis, bacteremia, and PJP, and all of these would require face-to-face evaluation if suspected). Patients with bronchiectasis in particular may need close monitoring, given infectious issues at baseline related to this that may place such individuals at risk. Patients with central lines and/or neutropenia will still require blood cultures and antibiotics if they become ill (depending on their clinical scenario). 3) New cases of suspected SCID or other T-cell deficiencies should continue to be seen and assessed as would occur under normal service operations.",

Plans must be made to ensure that home immunoglobulin replacement services continue, because this is an urgent therapy. It is unlikely that any current immunoglobulin supply has SARS-CoV-2 antibody protection or is contaminated with the virus. Given that this is a donor-dependent therapy, this could affect future supplies. Patient may wish to consider transitioning to home immunoglobulin replacement (IV/SC). 6) Autoimmune phenomena must be tended to promptly. Concern for autoimmune cytopenias or enteropathy need prompt evaluation, treatment, and monitoring. 7) For those patients receiving various immunosuppressive agents that require therapeutic drug-level monitoring, phlebotomy services must be accessible to monitor for toxicities. This is critical for autoimmune and transplant (BMT/solid-organ) patients. 8) Patients who are also being treated for malignancy should continue receiving chemotherapy. 9) Telehealth should be considered for routine/annual follow-up, and in many cases it may be reasonable to defer routine monitoring labs, imaging, and PFTs for several months. 10) Telehealth may be considered for acute visits for possible infections that are low acuity (ie, otitis media, sinusitis, and superficial skin infections). 11) Telehealth may be considered for initial consultations of patients referred for possible immunodeficiency; however, in some circumstances, face-toface evaluations and access to ancillary laboratory services may be needed. 12) Clinicians should review routine self-care examination measures with patients, such as palpation of lymph nodes, joints, and cavities that in some conditions may be prone to abscess development, and recommend to patients a frequency with which these should be performed.",

Preliminary data suggest that the coronavirus may have originated in bats and undergone recombination in the pangolin (a scaly anteater), an endangered and commonly trafficked mammal. E1 But in contrast to the 2003 epidemic SARS, which spread to more than 2 dozen countries before it was contained, global spread has been more dramatic with SARS-Cov-2. Between November 2002 and July 2003, a total of 8090 probable SARS cases were reported to the World Health Organization, with only 8 US cases having laboratory evidence of SARS-CoV.

E9,E10 Both the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, & Immunology (AAAAI) and the American College of Allergy, Asthma, & Immunology (ACAAI) have been strong advocates to advance telehealth to allow allergy/immunology services to expand and most directly serve patients where they are needed. E9,E11 An excellent example of telehealth in practice is its use in penicillin allergy delabeling. E12,E13 Telehealth services have also been shown to be a viable alternative option to face-to-face visits for the management of patients with various conditions in the spectrum of allergic/immunologic disorders, including asthma. E14 Providers who wish to limit their exposure to infected patients may choose to see patients from their home. To do this, patients would go to the allergist's office where they could be seen by the allergist using facilitated telehealth. This type of facilitated visit should be done using 2-way video using a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Actecompliant platform. E15 To perform a physical examination, which is required only for an initial visit, digital examination equipment including a stethoscope and high-resolution camera with an otoscope adaptor would be required. E16 Established patients do not require a physical examination unless medically necessary, so if the practice were limited to such patients, it is not necessary to acquire digital examination equipment. With appropriate training, a nurse in the allergist's office could serve as the tele-facilitator. If other providers are present in the office during the visit, procedures such as skin testing could be performed. This type of visit limits the provider's exposure to infectious diseases; however, it does not reduce the patient's exposure.",

E22 The emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic creates unique challenges to SDM, because societal interests may play a larger role in the doctor-patient interaction than in a nonpandemic setting. Infection control becomes critical to patients and clinicians alike, but face-to-face visits will have larger implications beyond the clinic that may not be appreciated in the moment. However, SDM can direct decision making and choices to seek face-to-face versus telehealth encounters, particularly before escalation to a \"red zone\" threat level ( Figure 2 ). However, even in a \"red zone\" threat level, SDM will likely continue to play a role, although this will be significantly limited-for example, in decisions whether or not to postpone a course of aeroallergen immunotherapy or simply mark the course completed after 3 years of therapy. However, it must be acknowledged that in the setting of a pandemic national emergency, when faced with restrictions on ambulatory services, the clinician and patient will each have more limited access to resources that would be more available in nonemergent settings, and some decisions will be made on their behalf. What may be more challenging than limiting health care access in nonurgent situations is directing a patient with conditional health risk that exceeds the risk of contracting COVID-19 to break social distancing and seek faceto-face care.

Difficult discussions with staff who perform these assessments and diagnostic procedures may need to occur, and lay-offs may be necessary due to fiscal limitations.
