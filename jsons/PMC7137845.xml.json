Second, insurance against what? And, third, security for whom?",

The definition of human security offered by the Commission on Human Security3 is: \u201cto protect the vital core of all human lives in ways that enhance human freedoms and human fulfilment\u201d. The core of a person's life is closely concerned with the person's wellbeing and agency, which is best viewed in terms of his or her \u201ccapability\u201d to achieve alternative \u201cbeings and doings\u201d.4 In this context, health assumes central importance for two reasons: it is directly constitutive of a person's wellbeing; and it enables a person to function as an agent\u2014that is, to pursue the various goals and projects in life that he or she has reason to value. This view deploys the notion of well-functioning, but it is not grounded in notions of economic welfare that are based on utility or income. It is, rather, an agency-centred view of a person, for whom ill health restricts the scope of human agency. Since our ability to do things typically depends on our being alive, the capability to lead a long and healthy life must itself be regarded as a basic capability.",

The probability of falling below a minimum threshold depends on both how vulnerable a person is\u2014the degree of downside risk the person faces\u2014and how much above the threshold he or she is in the relevant dimension.1 The extreme case of insecurity is certainty of being below a specified threshold, and the absence of any chance of avoiding that fate.",

Over the decades, Japan has also undertaken policies to advance human security in other dimensions, such as basic education, social protection, and economic safety nets. Internationally, Japan has used the concept of human security to guide assistance to developing countries through bilateral aid and multilateral policies. The range and reach of the idea of human security are extensive, as Japanese actions have shown. A central manifestation of these actions is the country's commitment to universal health insurance.",
