Here we present a simple clinical workflow that uses a sensitive and highly specific colorimetric reverse-transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) to detect SARS-CoV-2 and takes forty minutes from sample collection to result. This test requires no specialized equipment and costs a few dollars per sample. Nasopharyngeal samples collected in saline were added either directly (unprocessed) to RT-LAMP reactions or first inactivated by a combined chemical and heat treatment step to .

(which was not certified by peer review) : medRxiv preprint 2 inhibit RNases and lyse virions and human cells. The specimens were then amplified with two SARS-CoV-2-specific primer sets and an internal specimen control; the resulting color change was visually interpreted. While direct addition of unprocessed specimens to RT-LAMP reactions could reliably detect samples with abundant SARS-CoV-2, the assay sensitivity markedly increased after the addition of an inactivation step. In 62 clinical samples with a wide range of SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid concentrations, the assay had 87.5% sensitivity and 100% specificity with a limit of detection at least 25 copies/\u00b5L, making it an ideal test to rule in infection. To increase sensitivity, samples that tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 by direct sample addition could be reflexed to a purification step, to increase the effective per-reaction sample input volume. In 40 purified samples, the assay yielded a 90% sensitivity and 100% specificity, with a limit of detection comparable to commercially available real-time PCR-based diagnostics that have received Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) from the FDA. This test for SARS-CoV-2 can be performed in a range of settings for a fraction of the price of other available tests, with limited equipment, and without relying on over-burdened supply chains to increase overall testing capacity.",

While extremely convenient, respiratory viral LFAs tend to be less sensitive than nucleic-acid amplification methods, with an average sensitivity of 61-75% [1] , and require high affinity, non-cross-reacting antibodies that are arduous to isolate. As an alternative to less sensitive antigen detection methods and difficult or expensive real-time PCR tests, isothermal amplification methods such as loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) and recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) enable sensitive detection of nucleic acids with just the use of a stable heat source in as little at 15 minutes. Colorimetric RT-LAMP expands on the basic LAMP technology with a one-pot reaction that contains both reverse transcriptase and DNA polymerase with visual detection of nucleic acid amplification due to a pH indicator dye within the master mix, obviating the need for additional detection equipment [2] . LAMP has been used to detect many pathogens including Zika virus [3] , Mycobacterium tuberculosis [4] , malaria [5] , and human leishmaniasis [6] . RT-LAMP has also been performed on extracted RNA for subsequent CRISPR-Cas12-based detection of SARS-CoV-2 [7] .",

With the goal of directly adding unprocessed sample into the RT-LAMP reaction ( Fig.   2A ), we first optimized the transport media input volume.

UTM interfered with the colorimetric readout, with complete inhibition of the pHmediated color change with 3 \u00b5L of input, while saline had little effect (Fig. 2B) .

Prior to sample addition to the RT-LAMP reaction, the NP specimen can undergo a five-minute heat and chemical to destroy endogenous RNases and lyse viral particles and human cells. The RT-LAMP reaction occurs at 65\u00b0C for 30 minutes, during which the amplification of SARS-CoV-2 RNA generates protons that decrease the pH of the reaction mix and result in a color change due to the media's colorimetric pH indicator. Samples are removed from the heat block, immersed in ice to enhance the color brightness, and color change is visually determined. If the controls are valid, a yellow color change with the ORF1a and/or N gene primers indicates the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in the sample.",
