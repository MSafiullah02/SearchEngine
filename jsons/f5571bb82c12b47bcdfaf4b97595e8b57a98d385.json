Announcing that the country was at \"war,\" President Macron called upon all to play a role in mitigating against further development of contagion. This extreme measure never seen before during peace time was the result of adapting not only the French Pandemic Influenza Plan (PIP) being applied to the national context but also real-time clinical, epidemiological, and scientific information about the evolution of COVID-19 infection in the country. The situation was further complicated by local municipal elections and political agendas by populist opinions. Despite mass communication about the importance of individual behavioral attitudes to counter disease propagation, few heeded government advice. Consequently, the situation rapidly deteriorated with increasing number of cases that started to overwhelm health services. As a result, decisive and immediate action was taken by the State for the national public health interest. This report from the field details the timely events that contributed to this extreme policy decision taken by France. A policy decision that other Western democracies have since applied as the pandemic disseminated across the globe.",

Government policy advised only selfisolation if possible and confinement of children at home for those returning from Italy.

The government response was to ban grouping of more than 5000 people thereby canceling all sporting events and concerts. The annual Paris Agricultural salon regrouping farmers from all over France was canceled on the final day to much dismay and confusion. Throughout this time, the importance of handwashing and individual behaviors to limit transmission were constantly droned by authorities. However, public ambivalence may have also been due to the scientific community minimizing the effects of infection comparing it with seasonal influenza. Limited knowledge about COVID-19, advocated that infection was fairly \"harmless\" with fatalities limited only to high-risk groups, ie, essentially the elderly (a message still communicated until very recently). By March 4, public concern about the epidemic started to result in the first signs of panic resulting in stocks of masks and hydroalcoholic gel to be exhausted. 6 Consequently, the government requisitioned protective masks, communicating that this form of protective barrier should be reserved only for those who displayed signs of illness and for use by health professionals. In addition to this, the price of hydroalcoholic disinfectant gel was blocked to prevent profiteering. However, at present the stocks of masks and hydroalcoholic disinfectant gel is still precariously low.",

            "text": "Media reporting a thousand infections by March 8, confinement measures, and school closures in whole regions probably amplified a state of panic of the general population. Consequently, people started to stockpile food and supermarket shelves started to empty rapidly. 7 Despite messages of reassurance from the government that food supply would continue, news coverage of quarantine measures taken in China, Spain, and Italy probably contributed to this behavior in anticipation of a similar response in France, a situation not accounted for by the French PIP because the WHO Pandemic Influenza Risk Management Guide advised against the use of confinement measures. 2, 5 French management of this unprecedented situation has juggled between individual liberties and effective infectious disease control. 8 The success of nationwide confinement measures observed in other countries to control infection forced France to follow suit. Despite the economic fallout of this approach, declaring \"war\" on the epidemic has enabled France to use a whole-of-society approach to defeat COVID-19 as quickly as possible. Thereby mobilizing all private and public sectors (eg, the use of industry to produce masks and disinfectant gel). Although experience from the past Ebola epidemic has illustrated that border closures are futile, France lobbied the European Union (EU) to close the Schengen treaty zone to all non-EU citizens to limit viral dissemination. Other European countries have gone 1 step further and closed their borders more for political reasons than infectious disease control. 9 Significant knowledge gaps about COVID-19 hampered crisis management and PIP implementation. Although the application of the French PIP to a disease that spreads more rapidly than influenza with a higher morbidity and mortality rate is debatable. The virus's basic reproductive number (Ro) is estimated to be between 2 and 3, although some publications have reported a Ro of 11. 10 While disease mortality varied according to different populations (3-4% mortality in China, 7% in Italy). 11 Rising case fatality rates in France as the epidemic progressed and the success of confinement measures experienced other countries contributed to the decision to impose nationwide confinement. Robust mathematical modeling and clinical experience revealed that the infection rate was underestimated, following the same kinetic as the Italian epidemic. 11 In the absence of mass confinement, approximately 30 million people would be infected with an epidemiological peak reached in 50 days. Clinical observations in France illustrated all age groups over 25 years affected and clinical manifestations ranged from asymptomatic, mild (80% of cases), to severe. Half of intensive care unit (ICU) patients were under 60 years, with 5% requiring respiratory assistance. For unknown reasons, severe complications have also occurred in healthy patients unaffected by extreme age or comorbidities (diabetes, obesity, etc.). It is hypothesized that anti-inflammatory medication may be the root cause for this phenomenon. In contrast children are largely asymptomatic healthy carriers (hence, the closure of schools).",
