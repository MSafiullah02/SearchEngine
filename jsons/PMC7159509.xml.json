The goals of pretransplant infectious disease screening are: (1) to identify conditions which may disqualify either donor or recipient, (2) to identify and treat active infection pretransplant, (3) to define the risk of infection and determine strategies for preventing and mitigating posttransplant infection and (4) to implement preventative interventions, such as updating of vaccination status. Although there is general agreement on the major infections for which screening is performed, there is some variation between centers in the types of screening used and actions taken as a result.",

Serologies are performed in laboratories associated with organ procurement organizations (OPOs) or other reference laboratories, which operate on a 24\u2010hour basis to generate the data needed to determine donor suitability. Because of time constraints and the extensive geographic areas covered by some OPOs, testing is often limited to serologic methods that are rapid and routinely available. Because more sensitive testing may not be available, some infections, such as HIV and HCV, may be difficult to diagnose at an early stage, before the development of specific antibody (17, 20). Thus, a detailed social and medical history on the donor is required to identify potential infections that might not be detected by serologic testing. Furthermore, certain infections may come to light only after the transplant has been performed, when results of routine procurement cultures of blood, urine, and sputum become available. Increasingly, some OPO's are utilizing rapid molecular testing, particularly in high\u2010risk potential donors, for rapid detection of viral genetic material (NAAT), particularly for viral infections such as HCV, HBV and HIV. Testing for certain pathogens with particular geographic significance such as Trypanosoma cruzi (Chagas disease) and WNV may be performed by some OPOs. If a deceased donor with uncertain infection risk is to be used, informed consent of the recipient should include the risk for infection transmission.",

Potential living donors should have PPD testing performed (a two\u2010stage tuberculin skin test if from an endemic area) or TB IGRA testing (36); if either test is positive, additional testing should be performed to rule out active infection (III). If there are symptoms or chest radiograph findings suggestive of active disease, sputum AFB cultures should be performed; chest computed tomography (CT) may be helpful in assessing adenopathy. Urine microscopy and AFB cultures, excretory urogram and abdominal CT scanning may be useful in PPD\u2010positive prospective kidney donors. If there are no signs or symptoms of active disease and the chest radiograph is normal, sputum AFB cultures are very low\u2010yield. Management of the prospective living donor with latent TB infection (LTBI) differs in areas of differing endemicity. Delay of transplant until the living donor is treated for LTBI (with isoniazid for 9 months or rifampin for 3 months) is appropriate, should another suitable donor not be available. In TB endemic areas, where as many as 30\u201340% of donors have LTBI, it may be difficult to avoid the use of infected donors. One cohort study from an endemic area demonstrated no benefit to treating the prospective living donor with LTBI prior to transplantation (37).

This may represent either a false\u2010positive test (if isolated HBcAb positive) or persistent HBV infection. If the latter, there is a significant risk of transmission of HBV to a liver transplant recipient, and therefore these livers were often not utilized in the past (II\u20102); however, it has now become more common to transplant livers from HBcAb positive donors with intensive posttransplant prophylaxis (58). The risk for transmission to nonhepatic recipients appears to be low but not zero (56, 57); this risk can be further diminished by pretransplant HBV vaccination of the recipient. Some centers restrict the use of such organs to life\u2010threatening situations and/or vaccinated recipients, or would utilize posttransplant prophylaxis with hepatitis B immune globulin (HBIG) and/or lamivudine if transplanted into a nonimmune recipient (II\u20103) (11). Because of the possibility of being offered such an organ, it is prudent to vaccinate all seronegative transplant candidates with HBV vaccine, although the response to this vaccine in patients with end\u2010stage organ disease may be suboptimal, and higher or additional dosing strategies may be required (III). A donor HBV\u2010DNA level provides helpful information for designing prophylactic strategies, even if the result is received after transplant (11).

In patients undergoing a liver transplant because of end\u2010stage liver disease due to HBV, there are a variety of posttransplant protocols for prevention of reactivation of HBV, many utilizing HBIg. Nonhepatic transplantation in HBsAg positive recipients has been controversial. In the early days of kidney transplantation, such transplants were performed, with some recipients developing early fulminant liver disease and a greater number developing chronic liver disease. Some have maintained asymptomatic status after many years despite evidence of active viral replication (59). Then, for a period of time, HBsAg positive status was considered a contraindication to nonhepatic transplantation. Now, with more effective therapies such as lamivudine, adefovir and tenofovir available, it appears theoretically possible to transplant such recipients more safely (60) although antiviral resistance may become an issue (III).",

Since July 2002, all US blood bank products have been tested for WNV using the investigational NAAT performed at specific centers. In the fall of 2003, the US Health Resources and Service Administration (HRSA) issued a Guidance statement regarding donors and WNV, which recommended testing all prospective live donors with NAAT close to the time of transplant; avoiding donors with any form of unexplained or confirmed WNV encephalitis; and heightened clinical suspicion on the part of the treating clinician for any febrile illness occurring shortly after transplant. NAAT poses logistical challenges in some UNOS regions and is not mandated or donor screening. There is also concern that false positive NAAT may result in loss of noninfected organs and net loss of life particularly for liver and heart candidates on the waiting list (78).
