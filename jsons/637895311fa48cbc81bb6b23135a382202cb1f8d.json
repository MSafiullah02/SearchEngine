Emerging infections become endemic and are here to stay marking their presence with an annual death toll. Each decade brings a new onslaught of emerging infectious agents. We are surprised again and again but are never prepared. The long-term consequences often remain unrecognized and are always inconvenient including cancer, cardiovascular disease and immune associated diseases that threaten our health.

The lesson remains the same, volcanic eruptions; climate change and asteroid impact threaten life in a highly significant way and are responsible for extensive selection pressure. Unfortunately, these events are unpredictable and so enormous little can be done about them.

There are numerous questions that strike investigators as they ponder a collection of viral agents like those in Table 3 .3. The viral polymerase errors in replicating single-stranded RNA genomes are not corrected so the species are constantly changing.

HIV-1 genome diversity includes base substitution, insertion, deletion, recombination, and gain or loss of glycosylation sites which all arises from the limited fidelity of the viral reverse transcriptase. These mutations are found in clusters or hypervariable regions indicating the fit virus is selected for from vast numbers of less-fit genome sequences. HIV-1 emphasizes key observations: (1) EID is a significant contemporary concern, (2) we are not prepared for the novel characteristics introduced by EID, (3) clinical signs can be diverse and often mimic symptoms of other diseases, and (4) the replication mechanisms are often error prone resulting in an array of fit viruses. Dengue is a flavivirus with a positive sense single-stranded RNA (+ssRNA) genome carried by mosquitos to man. Dengue has been a tropical disease for hundreds of years, typically a disease of young children but in 1953 an emerging severity was recognized in Manila (Table 3 .3), hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS). More than 2 billion people are at risk of dengue infection but only a small fraction of those infected will develop DHF or DHS. Infected people develop antibodies that can lead to antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) in subsequent infections and more severe DHF or DSS outcomes. It appears ADE events occur in people that produce immunoglobins (IgGs) with enhanced affinity to the activating Fc receptor due to the IgG1 subclass and lack of a fucose glycan modification of the IgG (Wang et al. 2017) Aedes aegypti is the primary vector transmitting dengue but a new vector, Aedes albopictus, now carries dengue to the southern United States.

All of the untreated control monkeys died between days 8 and 10 following viral injection.

The existence of defective viral genomes may offer potential for rapid change but in a stable host, change was not rapid. When one considers the magnitude of differences in conditions as a virus jumps from a reservoir host to a human, rapid adaptability is a great advantage. A virus that kills all the hosts is not a successful virus. Perhaps defective viral particles facilitate host immune responses giving them a chance to catch up to the rapidly proliferating virus. The Ebola outbreak of 2014 illuminated the collateral damage that accompanies EID outbreaks. First, the first responders are local physicians and care givers are killed leaving a population lacking doctors and nurses. Even physicians trained to exercise appropriate caution when interacting with patients such as Dr. Sheik Humarr Khan died of the Ebola infection (Bausch et al. 2014) . Second, women are the main caregivers in their families and 75 percent of Ebola deaths in the 2014 outbreak were women. This leaves families lacking traditional structure. Third, the outbreak disrupts production, labor markets and trade resulting in scarcity and inflation of food prices. Food security and nutrition are diminished which preferentially affects poor people as they spend 50 to 70% of their income on food. Finally, public health measures are discontinued.

These nontraditional food animals appeared in street markets in urban areas bringing people close to the reservoir host triggering the outbreak.

The natural host is the fruit bat, which infects a variety of small mammals including the civet cat.
