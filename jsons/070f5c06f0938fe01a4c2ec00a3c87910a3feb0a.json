We found that the 15411-nucleotide genome of PL97-1 consisted of a 189-nucleotide 5 noncoding region (NCR), a 15071-nucleotide protein-coding region, and a 151-nucleotide 3 NCR, followed by a poly (A) tail. The 5 -end of PL97-1 began with 1 ATG ACG TAT AGG 12 . Comparison of the PL97-1 genome with the 11 fully sequenced PRRSV genomes currently available revealed sequence divergence ranging from 0.3% (the VR-2332-derived vaccine MLV RespPRRS/Repro strain) to 38% (the Dutch Lelystad strain). To better understand the genetic relationships between these different strains, phylogenetic analyses were performed on the full-length PRRSV genomes. Significantly, the phylogenetic tree based on the ORF1b or ORF7 genes most closely resembled the tree based on the full-length genomes. Thus, these single genes will be the most useful in revealing the genetic relationships between the different strains relative to their geographical distribution. Extensive phylogenetic analyses using the ORF7 sequences of 111 PRRSV isolates available revealed that PL97-1 is most closely related to the North American genotype VR-2332, a VR-2332-derived vaccine strain, and Chinese BJ-4. It is distantly related to the European genotype Lelystad.

PRRS is a global disease that has an immense economic impact on the swine industry.

However, the predicted secondary RNA structures of the 5 NCR has suggested that its 5 three-quarters forms three conserved stem-loop structures in the North American genotypes and two in the European strains, whereas the 3 quarter that includes the highly conserved 45 nucleotides was predicted to be a variable domain (Tan et al., 2001) . Thus, the nucleotide sequence of the highly conserved 45 nucleotides, rather than its secondary structure, might be critical for viral replication/transcription. In comparison, the PRRSV 3 NCR sequence is less divergent and a 23-nucleotide stretch in the middle of the 3 NCR was absolutely conserved in all 12 fully sequenced PRRSV genomes. Thus, it may play an important role in viral replication. The Lelystad genome also contained three deletions of 3-, 18-, and 17-nucleotides in the beginning of its 3 NCR, which suggests that this region may not be required for viral replication. A recent study of infectious Lelystad cDNA revealed that the deletion of the 7 nucleotides, but not of 32 nucleotides, immediately downstream of ORF7 did not affect infectious virus production (Verheije et al., 2001) . Further investigations are needed to elucidate this issue.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 521, "end": 539, "text": "(Tan et al., 2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 1322, "end": 1345, "text": "(Verheije et al., 2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF56"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Although over 200 PRRSV strains have been isolated from widely different geographical regions, most have been only partially sequenced.

We showed that the Lelystad strain was distantly related to the other fully sequenced strains and formed the only fully sequenced European genotype isolate to date, while the other 11 strains, including PL97-1, formed the North American genotype.

Extensive ORF7 gene-based phylogenetic analysis using 111 selected strains confirmed the phylogenetic relationships determined with the 12 fully sequenced strains. The ORF7 gene-based analysis also showed high genetic variation exists not only between two genotypes but also within each genotype, as indicated previously (Meng et al., 1995b; Forsberg et al., 2002) . Moreover, major nucleotide differences in the ORF1 have also been described previously (Allende et al., 1999) . Although the functional significance of this genetic variation remains to be determined, antigenic differences between two genotypes on a serological basis have been reported (Drew et al., 1995; Katz et al., 1995; Sorensen et al., 1998) .

Each genotype contains strains that were isolated from the same geographic location in the same or another year yet belong to different clusters. This may reflect the introduction of a new variant strain into the same geographic location by, for example, animal or semen transport. This is supported by a recent study suggested that the genetic variation of the different strains in the same herd was caused by animal or semen transport rather than by local evolution Goldberg et al., 2000) . Alternatively, the preexisting strains may evolve locally into new variants during intra-and inter-animal spread due to a combination of the error-prone viral RNA polymerase and selective pressure. These two scenarios are not mutually exclusive and depend largely on geographic location and time of isolation. With regard to the Japanese encephalitis virus, all known five viral genotypes including the oldest are found in a region of Indonesia-Malaysia. However, newer genotypes appear to have spread from this region into other geographical locations at given time periods (Solomon et al., 2003) . If this is the case for PRRVS as well, the origin of PRRSV where both genotypes can be found remains to be discovered.

First, the modified live vaccine used in Korea since 1996 may have persisted and mutated into a less attenuated variant, causing clinical signs upon infection and spread.

The PL97-1 strain appeared to contain the three reversion mutations (codon positions 331 of ORF1a, 946 of ORF1b, and 151 of ORF5), which invariably found in all field isolates of PRRSV reported by other investigators Storgaard et al., 1999; Wesley et al., 1999; Nielsen et al., 2001) .

The 5-end nucleotides of PL97-1 begin with ATG ACG TAT AGG. These were also observed in the B-1(sh)/2002, P129, VR-2332, PA8, and SP strains (Fig. 1A). However, in BJ-4 and RespPRRS MLV, an additional T was reported to be present (Fig. 1A). An additional T has been found previously in the 5\u2032-end of the VR-2332 genome (Oleksiewicz et al., 1999; Shen et al., 2000) but not in the 5\u2032-ends of the two vaccine strains RespPRRS MLV (Oleksiewicz et al., 1999) and SP (Shen et al., 2000). The 5\u2032-end of the 16244B strain was defined as 1CGC CCG\nGGC AGG12 (Fig. 1A) (Allende et al., 1999). The 23- and 24-nucleotides at the utmost 5\u2032-end of NVSL 97-7985 and MLV RespPRRS/Repro, respectively, were not reported (Fig. 1A, open box). Although Lelystad diverges considerably from other strains, including PL97-1, the 3\u2032-end portion of its 5\u2032NCR is highly conserved (Fig. 1A, dash-line box). We found that the sequence 15394AAC CAT GCG GCC GAA ATT15411 terminates the 3\u2032-end of the viral genome, followed by a 54-64 bp poly(A) tail. Comparison of the 3\u2032NCR sequences revealed a high degree of genetic consertion (Fig. 1B). The 3\u2032NCRs of all strains except Lelystad were invariably 151 nucleotides long. The 37-nucleotide shorter 3NCR of the Lelystad strain is due to a string of 3, 18, and 17 nucleotide deletions at the beginning of its 3\u2032NCR (Fig. 1B, open box) as well as an insertion of A at position 128. The 151-nucleotide 3NCR of HB-1(sh)/2002 involves a deletion of A at position 17 and an addition of T at the 3\u2032-end of the genome prior to the poly(A) tail (Fig. 1B). Notably, a stretch of 23 bases at positions 82-104 is absolutely conserved between Lelystad and the other PRRSVs, including PL97-1 (Fig. 1B, dash-line box).\nWe plotted the number of nucleotide (Fig. 2A) and amino acid (Fig. 2B) alterations at each residue throughout all 11 fully sequenced PRRSV genomes of the North American genotypes relative to their consensus sequeeotide sequence variations were noted in four subregions of the genome, such as the 5\u2032 half of ORF1a, the 3\u2032end\n</td></tr><tr><td>MLV Vacc</td><td>AF 159portion of ORF1b, ORF4, and ORF5 (indicated as graded\n</td></tr><tr><td>SP Vacca Thced Pdivm 0.3 to 38.0%.
