Most of the COVID-19 researches is conducting on country or territory levels. However, the world statistics show a large variation between countries in terms of the number of confirmed positive COVID-19 cases, critical or serious cases, and mortality or recovery rate [1]. The meta-analysis research design gives us an excellent opportunity to pool the data and compare results in order to better understand COVID-19 epidemiology, mortality rate, risk factors, management options, and efficacy of prevention strategies as personal equipment, quarantine, and curfew.",

The journal has accepted the manuscript on 11 April 2020, then the work is available on the website and databases on 14 April 2020. In the PubMed database, and using the same search terms and MeSH terms in Young Hu analysis, there are 126 citations, the number of them is eligible to be included. Reporting of the last search is very important. Rapid peer review processing is required to keep the value of published metaanalysis. 2 Heterogeneity. The heterogeneity in meta-analysis of COVID-19 is highly expected. In fact, Hu et al analysis shows large heterogeneity in their analyses measured by I 2 index. Identifying and quantifying the heterogeneity, using the appropriate analysis based on the heterogeneity as fixed or random models of analysis, prediction intervals, subgroups analyses, and meta-regression are required [3] to better and precise estimation for the effect size in the meta-analysis that will be one of the primary factors for COVID-19 evidence-based practice. 3 Availability of meta-analysis data. Because of the growing number in COVID-19 researches, meta-analysis, and updated meta-analysis will be increased. The availability of meta-analysis statistical data and assessment of quality or risk of bias in included articles will make conducting of new meta-analysis or updated meta-analysis easier and faster with all respect for institutions' policies, and copyrights.",
