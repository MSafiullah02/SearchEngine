Conventional therapies were applied to these patients, but these were not successful. On this basis, these patients were recommended to take ascorbic acid. Different doses and schedules were used. For example, some patients were given IV ascorbic acid (10 g/day for 10 successive days), a few were given higher dose amounts, and some were chosen to give oral ascorbic acid (10 g/day) or a combination of both. A wide variety of responses were found. Dome of them had no or minimal response and some of them had tumor regression and tumor hemorrhage. Despite this important observation, a lack of control study prevented making any conclusion on the health benefits of ascorbic acid treatment. From a limited study published in 1975, it is apparent that one of the patients experienced tumor regression [60] . The patient who had reticulum cell sarcoma exhibited improvement due to the treatment with ascorbic acid. A reduction of the daily dose of ascorbic acid was not helpful since symptoms of the disease appeared. Notably, remission was successfully achieved again after the same patient was given a higher initial dose of ascorbic acid.",

This study was conducted on 36 patients with metastatic colorectal or gastric cancer. The principal aims were to evaluate the maximum-tolerated dose. Another goal was to determine the phase II dose of ascorbic acid with co-administration with mFOLFOX6 or FOLFIRI. Initially, all patients were given an identical chemotherapy treatment for 14 days with Vit-C infusions. Later, the concentration of ascorbic acid was altered for the dose-escalation investigation. This study demonstrated no dose-limiting toxicity. Therefore, a maximum-tolerated dose was not identified from this investigation. However, a dose of 1.5 g/kg for ascorbic acid was recommended for this phase II study. No adverse side effects were observed and the treatments were acceptable to the patients. Based on the success, a randomized phase III investigation is under progress. The goal of this study is to determine the clinical power of ascorbic acid against metastatic colorectal cancer in combination with mFOLFOX6 with or without bevacizumab [67] .",

The effectiveness of Vit-C in preventing common cold [82] and other health disorders J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f was questioned [83] [84] . The ascorbic acid therapy for acute inflammatory disorders was based upon numerous biological studies following many decades of research. The current interest in Vit-C focuses on bacterial sepsis and septic shock in patients. More than 300 scientific and clinical studies supported mechanistic data to use Vit-C against this disease [85, 86] . Some other additional role of Vit-C in the treatment of viral diseases is also possible. The biological concepts and evidence for the use of Vit-C in viral infections are described here.",

            "text": "Numerous studies identified that Vit-C in high dosages is virucidal [83] . This conclusion was based on in-vitro experiments. In the presence of copper and/or iron, high doses of Vit-C showed virucidal activity. This was explained through the formation of hydrogen peroxide and other radical initiators [87, 88] . Moreover, the low pH value of the system was responsible for the in-vitro antiviral effects of Vit-C. Despite these studies, the in vivo virucidal activity of Vit-C was not confirmed. It was well established that Vit-C is a powerful antioxidant and it can exert pro-oxidant effects at high concentrations. The generation of reactive oxygen species through the reduction of transition metal is possible [89] . It was found that a very high-dose of one sodium salt of ascorbic acid (90 mM) kills Candida albicans invitro through an iron-catalyzed Fenton reaction [90] . An iron chelator 2,2\u2032-bipyridyl inhibited this effect. An experiment demonstrated that Vit-C can decrease the viral load of the Ebstein-Barr virus (EBV) [91] . This observation suggested multiple mechanisms are involved in Vit-C-controlled anti-vital therapy. The activity of antigens and load was reduced through pre-treatment of human foreskin fibroblast and endothelial cells with ascorbate before cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection [92] . This observation was failed to reproduce when ascorbate is added after the infection. The immunomodulatory activities of Vit-C were responsible for this effect. In general, Ascorbic acid is concentrated in leucocytes, lymphocytes, and macrophages [93, 94] . Chemotaxis was improved by Vit-C [95] [96] [97] . The neutrophil phagocytic activity and oxidative death were also enhanced [95] [96] [97] . Lymphocyte proliferation was also accelerated [95] [96] [97] .",

Patients with infectious diseases do not have a sufficient level of Vit-C due to metabolic consumption [110] . Vit-C has immunomodulating properties in patients with viral infections. This is possible by increasing the production of \u03b1/\u03b2 interferons and downregulating the synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines. Despite that Vit-C have beneficial effects in viral infections no solid clinical data exists on this topic. Pauling suggested that Vit-C can be used for the treatment of the common cold. On this basis, most of the randomized controlled trials (RCTs') targeted the role of Vit-C in the prevention and treatment of the cold symptoms. In an analysis of 29 RCTs, Vit-C failed to reduce cold disease [82] . No consistent effects of Vit-C were observed also on the duration of colds in patients. Several studies, however, complicated the interpretation of these data.",

The concentration of ascorbic acid in plasma is decreased in post-herpetic neuralgia patients compared to healthy persons [111] . An RCT study was conducted with 41 patients who were subjected to IV Vit-C (50mg/kg on days 1, 3 and 5) or placebo [111] . It was found that those patients who were taken IV Vit-C have experienced less pain. In a non-blinded RCT, the role of ascorbic acid on acute herpetic pain and postherpetic neuralgia were evaluated [112] . Eighty-seven patients were given 5g of IV ascorbic acid on the first, third and fifth days or placebo. Interestingly, a few differences between the groups were observed. The treated group with Vit-C demonstrated a lower incidence of postherpetic neuralgia and a lower pain score. Vit-C is mostly concentrated in the aqueous humor of the anterior chamber of the eye. A retrospective cohort J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f investigation indicated that oral Vit-C reduced the risk of herpes simplex keratitis in combination with an oral antiviral drug [111] .",

Influenza A virus causes epidemics and pandemics that kill thousands of people every year. Experimental studies demonstrate a beneficial effect of ascorbic acid against influenza. Patients with respiratory disorders due to infection by influenza were treated with histone acetyltransferase (HAT) without corticosteroids. Remarkably, these patients showed rapid improvement after the initiation of HAT. Corticosteroids, on the other hand, have a complex role in the treatment of infection. As a result, corticosteroids may not be a standard choice in patients with influenza A infection [113, 114] .",

For example, a 26% ICU admission and a 4.3% mortality rate are observed among 138 cases [116] . It is believed that ARDS is the main mechanism for Covid19's action. This is followed by increased oxidative stress because of the release of free radicals and cytokines. Considering this mechanism of the process, a large dose of Vit-C should play a key role in the management of Covid19. A study indicates out of 99 Covid19 patients, 17 of them developed ARDS [117] . Eleven patients passed away due to multiple organ failure [117] . This death was explained due to increased oxidative stress and cytokine generation that lead to ARDS. Like influenza, coronaviruses are pandemic viruses that injure lung drastically [118] . This viral infection generates a \"storm\" of cytokines that reacts with the endothelial cells of the lung. This interaction causes neutrophil infiltration and enhances oxidative stress and damages the function of the lung barrier [118] . ARDS is characterized by strong hypoxemia. This is propagated because of multiple reasons. Uncontrolled inflammation, oxidative injury, and damage to the alveolarcapillary barrier are the main reasons [119] . The severe increased oxidative stress causes pulmonary injuries: lung injury (ALI) and ARDS. ALI and ARDS are key factors responsible for substantially high morbidity and mortality [120, 121] . An increase of C-reactive protein (hsCRP), an indicator of inflammation and oxidative stress is seen among Covid19 patients [122] . The transcription factor nuclear factor-erythroid-2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a major regulator of antioxidant response element (ARE) driven cytoprotective protein expression. It is believed that the activation of Nrf2 signaling pathways plays a crucial role in preventing cells and tissues to undergo oxidative stress.",
