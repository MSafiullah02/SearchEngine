To analyze how risk is perceived and expressed through these tools is relevant to risk theory. This chapter clarifies the different concepts of risk, contrasting especially the mathematically expressed ones with culturally informed notions, which address a broader view on risk. I will suggest that a fruitful way to contextualize computational tools, such mathematical models in risk assessment is ''analytics of risk,'' which ties together the technological, epistemological, and political dimensions of the process of governance of risk. I will clarify the development of mathematical modeling techniques through their use in infectious disease epidemiology. Epidemiological modeling functions as a form of ''risk calculation,'' which provides predictions of the infectious outbreak in question. These calculations help direct and design preventive actions toward the health outcomes of populations. This chapter analyzes two cases in which modeling methods are used for explanation-based and scenario-building predictions in order to anticipate the risks of infections caused by Haemophilus influenzae type b bacteria and A(H1N1) pandemic influenza virus. I will address an interesting tension that arises when model-based estimates exemplify the population-level reasoning of public health risks but has restricted capacity to address risks on individual level. Analyzing this tension will lead to a fuller account to understand the benefits and limitations of computational tools in the governance of public health risks.",

            "text": "In June 2009, we faced a risk of a global pandemic caused by A(H1N1) ''swine flu'' virus. At the moment WHO defined the outbreak a pandemic, a viral flu infection turned into a global risk. Two years later the risk assessment process that led to the global call is questioned. Was the ''swine flu'' a global risk after all? ''Nothing is a risk in itself '' shows that what is identified as a risk depends on the way in which ''danger is analyzed'' or how risks are identified. What, then, is a risk? Risk research answers to that question through three main paradigms: the statistical-probabilistic, the epidemiological, and the sociological. Initially developed for insurance industry, the statistical-probabilistic approach applies various estimates of personal benefits, effectiveness of treatments, and use ''risk calculations.'' This means translating ''successful calculations of risk'' into an objective measure. Estimates of how various healthrelated factors influence the probability of falling ill is a typical example of epidemiological paradigm. It comprises of psychometric studies, which focus on understanding public risk preferences and applies mental modeling to analyze rational decision making. When cultural and individual perception and responses to risk are interlinked, sociological approach is in use. Within this sociocultural paradigm, risk is regarded as a ''socially constructed phenomenon although it has some roots in nature.'' Furthermore, we can identify governmentality approach, which is based on Foucault's analysis of societal governance and includes into the analysis broader issues of power as a part of the sociological approaches to risk. This form of analysis includes ''construction of realities through practice and sense-making, encompassing the multitude of societal organizations and institutions producing social reality'' (Taylor-Gooby and Zinn 2006, p. 43 ).",

Dean argues that epidemiological risk forms a ''long-standing and pervasive form of risk rationality.'' In his words, ''epidemiological risk is concerned with the rates of morbidity and mortality among populations.'' When talking about epidemiological risk, ''the health outcomes of populations are subject of risk calculation'' (Dean 2010, p. 218) . In regard to public health risks, we can talk about risk rationality as a form of rationality, a way of thinking about and representing events, which happens through calculations (Dean 2010, p. 213) . Castell (1991) shows how mental health problems shifted in their classification as dangerous to risk as a part of historical, theoretical, and practical shift toward risk rationality. Underneath the emphasis of population as a subject of risk calculation is the historical shift from a family to population as a re-centering concept of economy. Michel Foucault argues that '' [. . .] population has its own regularities, its won rate of deaths and diseases. [. . .] [S]tatistics shows also that the domain of population involves a range of intrinsic, aggregate effects, phenomena that are irreducible to those of the family, such as epidemics. Population comes to appear above all else as the ultimate end of government'' (Foucault 1978 (Foucault /1991 . Population becomes the object of governance. The attitude or mentality of governance is known as governmentality in Foucault's work. It refers to the forms of thought, expertise, and knowledge that direct and guide the acts of governance (Dean 2010) . How the risk rationality that shifts ''dangerousness'' of disease outbreaks into risks manifest in epidemiology?",

            "text": "New risks ''violate many assumptions of risk calculation,'' as Taylor-Gooby and Zinn (2006, p. 25) argue. They are global, complex, and entangled with different areas. They share characteristics of catastrophes. These new risks are ''mainly invisible and inaccessible by direct means.'' They challenge the statistical-probabilistic approach to risk. How do we encounter these new risks? One way of coming into terms with them is suggested in Smith's analysis of SARS (Sudden Acute Respiratory Syndrome) epidemic (Smith 2006, p. 3114) . He proposes a mediatory approach in order to overcome the dichotomy between the realist and constructivist accounts to risk. According to his ''material-discursive'' position, ''risk is both a materially measurable probability of an event and a socially constructed element of how that probability is perceived by the individual and society.'' This mediatory approach is useful when explaining the ways in which risk is represented, anticipated, and processed in models. The mediatory approach does not solely lean on realist interpretation, which sees risk as an objective threat or danger that can be measured independently of the social context within which it occurs. Nor does it reduce risk to culturally or socially constructed threat, which cannot be demonstrated independently of those processes. Close to the realist interpretation is Schlich and Tr\u00f6chler's (2006) definition of risk and uncertainty. He says that ''one can speak of risk when the probability estimates of an event are known or at least knowable, while uncertainty, by contrast, implies that these probabilities are inestimable or unknown.'' Riesch (2011) provides a classification of uncertainties that problematizes the clear-cut division between probability estimates and unknown events. I suggest that new risks, such as emerging infectious outbreaks, can be encountered by accommodating statistical-probabilistic approach of risk calculation (in the form of mathematical modeling) with the questions of governance. In this chapter, I will apply the Foucauldian notion of governmentality and address risk calculation as a technical rationality. How could we see public health risks through this lens?",

            "text": "The heterogeneity of the definitions of risk suggests that understanding risk encompasses the following aspects: dangerousness of an event, unpredictability of its occurrence and course, Understanding and Governing Public Health Risks by Modeling and severity of its consequences. Infectious disease outbreaks, therefore, form a source of ''danger'' that affects the public. This means that public health risks are anticipated through surveillance and monitoring procedures, which are carried out by the national public health institutes. Surveillance and monitoring procedures comprise of keeping records of notifiable diseases or participating in international collaboration to govern outbreaks of emerging infections. Surveillance activities are carried out on various levels: on national level by public health institutes (e.g., Health Protection Agency in the UK) and on international and intergovernmental level (e.g., by WHO, ECDC, the European Disease Control Centre). However, risks from infectious outbreaks create a challenge for public health decision makers, who aim at identifying the risks through preparedness planning and revising protective interventions, such as vaccinations. Their interest is to employ predictions of the course of the outbreak. In order to do that, decision makers search for alternative ways to process the information flow. Evidence for developing the required preventive and protective measures for decision-making processes is produced by computer-based modeling techniques. Hence, modeling techniques can be utilized in the encounters with public health risks from infectious diseases. These modeled encounters provide predictions that facilitate risk assessment processes. This chapter shows how two modes of prediction: explanation-based and scenario-building provide strategies, not only to produce evidence for the decision-making, but also to translate the potential threat to a quantifiable, measurable risk. By doing so, modeled encounters with risks allow us to follow the social processes that try to control and minimize public health risk in society. In his commentary on climate models, Hulme et al. (2009, p. 127) highlights an important aspect of models, which is highly applicable to predictions from epidemiological models: ''Scientists and decision-makers should treat climate models not as truth machines, but instead as one of a range of tools to explore future possibilities.'' Through the analysis of the two types of predictions, I will address how epidemiological models function as technologies when encountering public health risks.",

I observed modeling practices in 22 work meetings (recorded and transcribed, duration of a meeting app. 2 h) at the National Public Health Institute (currently the Institute for Health and Welfare) and conducted 28 thematic, semi-structured interviews (transcribed for analysis) with mathematical modelers, epidemiologists, and computer scientists working as members of the interdisciplinary team (published in Mattila 2006a, b) . The models were published in Auranen 1999 Auranen , 2000 Auranen et al. 1996 Leino et al. 2000 , 2004 . The study analyzes how an integrated simulation model on Hib transmission in the Finnish population produces explanation-based predictions. In this chapter, I will keep the focus on a single, integrated model in order to allow a detailed description of the ways in which the model predicts. The findings from the Hib case will be discussed in relation to microsimulation model on mitigating an influenzae pandemic. This example will show how microsimulations produce scenario-building predictions. The analysis focuses on detailed micro-level observations and interpretations of the predictive capacities of microsimulations. Both models are chosen, because they provide clear examples of the predictive capacities of simulations. I have chosen not to explore the vast literature on pandemic influenzae models, but to concentrate on a detailed level on a single model. The analysis is informed by a practical course ''Introduction to Infectious Disease Modeling,'' organized by the London School for Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, 2006, which gave me ability to read the models and understand their core structure. As a part of the coursework, we analyzed the published pandemic simulation models and prepared a group exercise on national preparedness planning.

            "text": "One of the main reasons to develop modeling techniques is to overcome uncertainties related to complex phenomena, such as climate, economy, or infectious diseases. Establishing modeling practices also helps forming a network that integrates available knowledge and communicates it further. Paul Edwards (1999, p. 439) argues that ''Uncertainties exist not only because quantifiable, reducible empirical and computational limits, but also because of unquantifiable, irreducible epistemological limits related to inductive reasoning and modeling''(cf. also Hillerbrand 2010). His argument seems to suggest that due to the very nature of the modeled phenomenon itself, uncertainties remain as a part of the process. As Shackely and Wynne (1996, p. 276 ) emphasize, scientific knowledge, or the ''authority'' of Understanding and Governing Public Health Risks by Modeling it, is limited in policy making, since it prevents decisions to be made or actions taken. Van den Bogaard (1999, p. 323) shows, on the contrary, that the first macroeconometric model, developed by Tinbergen in the 1930s for the Dutch Central Planning Bureau, was a ''liberation both from the uncertainties caused by the whimsical nature of the economy and the woolly theories of the economists.'' One form of uncertainties remains within the models, as MacKenzie's (2005, p. 186 ) study on financial economics shows, ''models affect the reality they analyze.'' According to him, this ''reflexive connection serves to increase the veracity of finance theory's assumptions and the accuracy of its models' predictions,'' but it may also function in a counterproductive way (as in his case, the exploitation of arbitrage opportunities by using mathematical models leads to instability of the system). It seems to me that when modeling complex, open systems, such as climate (cf. Gramelsberger 2010) or ecological systems, there will remain uncertainties, because of limited computational capacity, biased reflection of the reality, or unpredictable nature of the phenomena themselves.",

''Risk identification,'' they continue, ''is socially organized by a wide variety of institutions which support prediction and related forms of intervention around the possibility of future events.'' When we encounter risks and uncertainties, or predict a possible course of events, we develop and utilize various measurement devices, such as statistical methods, surveys, and models. From a historical perspective, we can identify a shift away from ''informal expert judgment toward a greater reliance in quantifiable objects,'' as Porter (2000, p. 226 ) argues in his case study of the use of mortality statistics in life insurance industry. The tendencies underlying this shift are addressed by a growing interest in sociology of quantification -i.e., in the ''production and communication of numbers.'' How do we ''do things with numbers?'' Espeland and Stevens elaborate J.L. Austin's idea of speech acts (doing things with words) to the domain of quantification and they call it ''doing things with numbers.'' They argue that as with words, ''numbers often change as they travel across time and social space'' (Espeland and Stevens 2008, pp. 402-406) . The ''change in numbers'' could be seen as a parallel process to the one that characterizes how public health risks become quantified through its historical development. This historical development can be aligned with two processes: First, the development and application of mathematical methods in order to understand the dynamics of disease transmission (Mansnerus 2009a) , and second, the shift within biopolitics (politics that is concerned with governance of living conditions in a population) toward risk politics (Rose 2001) .",

These forms, namely ''control of vaccination,'' especially if understood as a process of assessing and revising vaccination schemes, and ''organizing the record of epidemics'' are present when modeling techniques are applied to public health risks. ''Control of vaccination'' is one component in modeling process; it is applied as a preventive measure, as an estimate in terms of ''herd immunity,'' immunity cover for the whole of population when only a significant portion of it is vaccinated. This can be obtained as an indirect observation from the models and it allows estimating the vaccination coverage needed to protect the whole population. Organizing the record of epidemics could be extended to cover the predictive functions, as the following case studies will show. So mathematical methods in epidemiology developed initially in conjunction with the early observations of infectious cycles and outbreaks that gave rise to develop preventive actions against these risks.",

Rose (2001) argues that the shift toward risk politics happened when public health programs and preventive medicine were transformed and health became ''economized,'' meaning that individuals were expected to became active in maintaining their well-being and health. Whereas the earlier programs understood health as fitness and were hence framed to tackle the ''unfitness of populations,'' the current emphasis is on costs of ill health for the economy (Rose 2001, pp. 5-7) . This shift results in various strategies for the government of risk. Rose says that risk denotes in this context ''a family of ways of thinking and acting, involving calculations about probable futures in the present followed by interventions into the present in order to control that potential future.'' And, he continues, demand for these collective measures increases. As we will learn from the detailed study of how modeled encounters with public health risks happen, I would argue that the shift toward risk governance is still partially embedded in the preventive ideals of public health risk perception. The predictions from the models I will study are not estimates of the economic costs of a pandemic, although those have been taken into account through different analyses. Model-based predictions seem to function as a way to estimate the need to vaccinate and to assess the spread of the infection. On the basis of these predictions, protective measures toward the public can be initiated. But how do we actually build models to predict public health risks?",

Importantly, these models are not only scientific exercises to develop better computational algorithms, they are built first and foremost to explain, understand, and predict the infectious disease outbreaks or transmission processes. The major application of this group of models (including also simulations) is to design, for example, reliable and cost-effective vaccination strategies or to predict the course of influenza pandemic (Mattila 2006a, b, c) .

Model-based predictions can be grounded on explanatory mechanisms, as the case of Hib transmission models, or they can provide desirable qualitative tools in a form of scenario-building prediction, as we will see. This is an interesting outcome, and useful when we are looking at how predictions help in public health risk assessment.

Hib is capable of causing severe and often life-threatening diseases, such as meningitis and pneumonia in young children (an estimated three million cases of serious illness and 400,000 deaths each year in children under 5 years of age worldwide). A part of the incentive to produce model-based predictions lies in the cost of vaccines. Hib vaccine is not yet a part of national vaccination strategies in the developing countries, mainly in Africa and Asia. Polysaccharide vaccines were on market in the 1970s and conjugates in the 1980s. The main difference is that the polysaccharides protect against the disease forms, whereas the conjugates are capable of reducing the carriage of the bacteria and hence have effect on population level circulation of the bacteria. If considered from the economic point of view, polysaccharide vaccines are older and somewhat cheaper to produce, and the conjugates are more expensive. As clarified by Hib Initiative, Hib infections are difficult to treat in the developing countries, due to the lack of access to antibiotics, which are proven to be effective when treating the severe disease forms (www.hibaction.org, accessed 25.3.2009). Because of this, the Hib Initiative presents an estimate that 20% of children in developing countries with meningitis caused by Hib will die and 15-20% of children suffering from it will develop lifelong disabilities. As an epidemiologist from the Helsinki modeling group argues: \" WHO and GAVI (the Global Alliance of Vaccinations and Inoculations) advocate Hib conjugate vaccines, the major question remains whether universal vaccination will be at all feasible in the poorest economies. Will it be cost-effective, and will it be an appropriate use of resources among other possible health interventions? Schedules optimizing the age of vaccination and the number of doses are crucial for the acceptance of the expensive vaccines .",

This question is by its nature a ''what would happen if '' question that has a predictive emphasis. To see how this question was manipulated in the model, we need to unpack the structure of the model itself. The population-simulation model, published in 2004, has a three-part structure: a demographic model (covering the age-structure of a Finnish population), a Hib-transmission model (including the contact-site structure), and an immunity model (including the immunization program and its effects). Yet, this simulation model resulted after a 10-year period of modeling work, which was dominated by integrating practices that brought together the three parts, built earlier in the project (see Mattila 2006c) . So, all three parts, especially the transmission model and immunity model, were partially studied prior to the accomplishment of the population-simulation model (2004) These questions address particular aspects that affect the transmission dynamics in a population: length of immunity, estimate related to the force of infection, and effect of vaccinations. In particular, two mechanisms were detected in these models: the mechanism of immunity and mechanism of transmission. Mechanism of immunity was defined as: \" Natural immunity is believed to depend on repeated exposure to Hib bacteria resulting in the production of functional antibody ).",

In the simulation model, it was used for explaining what would happen to the natural immunity, when vaccinations were introduced on a population level. This was an important aspect, since the epidemiological studies of the chosen vaccine confirmed that the vaccine itself is capable of reducing carriage. The reduction of carriage in a population could potentially lead to the waning of the natural immunity that had protective impact on a population level. In other words, herd immunity (the population level protection against an infection) could be affected (cf. Fine 1993). This indirect effect was documented in the model studying the dynamics of natural immunity. This mechanism and its numerical estimates, which were defined in terms of Hib antibody dynamics, show the descending trend in serum antibody concentration. Later, this mechanism was integrated in the population-simulation model, in particular into its immunity model part. Hence, the mechanism of natural immunity, when manipulated in the simulation model, showed that if the bacterial circulation is diminished, the natural immunity is likely to weaken and a potential increase in the risk of serious infections may affect those who are not vaccinated.",

The pandemic spread all around the world and lasted about 2 years (1918) (1919) (1920) . Its oddities were that it infected and killed young and healthy, and it spread during the spring months. The most recent cycle of a pandemic began in the end of April 2009, when human cases of a novel influenza type A virus were confirmed. These cases were identified in the USA and in Mexico. The virus, according to epidemiological evidence, had been circulating in Mexico since February 2009 and may have emerged already earlier that year. It was also confirmed that the new human strain was identical to a strain of virus that had been circulating in pigs in North America. Flu survey reports that the A(H1N1) strain has a complicated history: ''some of its genes moved to birds to pigs in 1918, other genes from birds to pigs at the end of the 20th century, some got into pigs in the 1960s having first passed through humans.''",

The model in question is an individual-based simulation model of pandemic influenza transmission for Great Britain and the United States (Ferguson et al. 2006) . It represents transmission in households, schools and workplaces, and the wider community. The main aim of the model is to study strategies for mitigation of influenza pandemic. Mitigation means all actions that aim at reducing the impact of a pandemic (Nicoll and Coulombier 2009 ). I will focus on two model-based assumptions that affect the transmission: estimate for the reproductive rate and behavior. On the basis of a closer analysis of these assumptions, I will discuss the nature of scenario-building predictions and especially reflect on the suggested policy outcomes of this model.",

In infections that are transmitted from person-to-person, the potential of the spread is called the reproductive rate that depends on the risk of transmission in a contact and also on how common the contacts are.

This rate is usually determined by empirical data, i.e., by deriving the estimate from previous epidemiological studies. However, it is a rate that carries a ''fingerprint'' of the pathogen. By this I mean that the reproductive rate is sensitive to particular strain of the pathogen in question. This sensitivity brings in a question of uncertainty in the model-based predictions. What if the strain is not so virulent? Alternatives are taken into account by modeling different possible scenarios based on different approximates of the reproductive rate. But what do the models do to the reproductive rate? In pandemic flu modeling, a future strain is unknown and therefore the models actually use data from the past strains. This relies, of course, on the assumption that the future pandemic is as virulent and contagious as the past one. If we look more closely to the reproductive rate and its variation, we can see how it manifests itself as a fingerprint of the pathogen. This idea means that population density affects the estimate since R 0 tends to be higher in crowed populations. Nicoll and Coulombier (2009, Table 4 ) provide following estimates for R 0 :",

Models, either physical or numerical, seemed not to adjust to the changes in epistemic values shared in scientific communities, but also reflect aspirations of scientific patrons, as Oreskes discusses. Models seem to do more than epistemological work: in the attempts to predict the future, models generate predictions to inform policy decisions.

This means that calibration of the model is not indifferent to the other factors, expertise of building the model and practice of using the model when addressing instrumental reliability. Oreskes and Belitz (2001) make a similar point by arguing that all models are approximations, and they suggest that it is more useful to ''think of models as tools to be modified in response to knowledge gained through continued observation of the natural systems being represented.'' In other words, when estimating public health risks through model-based predictions, instrumental reliability refers to the fact that these predictions are not valid descriptions of reality, but best available approximations of the risk. They are not static either, but as more data are cumulated during the outbreak, they gain greater accuracy.

Explanation-based predictions were also modeled on the basis of limited data, for in that case, Understanding and Governing Public Health Risks by Modeling the data were collected for other purposes (as a part of pre-Hib vaccine studies) and therefore they did not accommodate all the relevant information for model parameterization. This meant that during the modeling, some parameter estimates were acquired on the basis of comparative datasets from collaborating research groups. Along with the limits of availability of data, computational capacity may present limits to modeled encounters with risks. The modelers may not be able to access the highest-level of computing power (such as supercomputers in national computing centers), which was the case with Hib-models. These technical limitations have an effect on the way in which models are built, how fluently a model-based prediction is gained, and how reliable the instrument, (i.e., the model) itself is. Limited access to high-level computational capacity restricted the number of simulation runs for the population-simulation model that estimated Hib transmission, for example. Although these restrictions may weaken the reliability of the model-based prediction, it is worth bearing in mind how Oreskes and Belitz (2001) described models as approximations.",

As we learned through the analysis of the two types of models, the modeling process itself is not highly transparent. Specialized expertise is required to build the models, and even those who work with modelers may not be able to assess the choice of mathematical algorithms during the process. Interdisciplinary modeling teams develop a division of labor (see Mattila 2006a) . This lack of transparency may be limiting when model-based predictions are communicated to audiences who have not been involved in the primary model building process or who are not familiar with modeling techniques. This is the point when models may turn into ''truth-machines,'' to gain their authority, as Hulme et al. (2009) suggests in the case of climate models. The assumptions made in the model may remain unknown due to the lack of communication of the modeling process and the choices made within it. Furthermore, as I described that these models are typically tailored to address specific policy-driven questions, one could consider this characteristic a limitation. How applicable are the outcomes? If the simulation model particularly addresses a question like ''what would happen if a child x in a day care unit y encounters a Hib infection?'', can the prediction be applied to estimate the risk of infection among adult men in military garrison? Or if the predictive scenario of a pandemic spread examines mitigation strategies, such as school closures or travel restrictions in a particular geographical location, can the estimates be extended to cover other areas as well? These questions address the inevitable limitations of modeled encounters with public health risks, which should not be read as a recommendation not to use modeling techniques or to advocate them. After all, model-based predictions, as these two cases show, are highly beneficial as a one source of evidence for the broader base of risk assessment.

This leads to a tension that arises when a public health risk manifests on a population level and appropriate health interventions are introduced, but at the same time, individuals consider their risk from a different angle and refuse or ignore to participate in the interventions. In other words, when an epidemic outbreak that causes a severe risk to the population (or to a part of it) happens, its further spread is prevented, for example, by vaccinations.",

The concept of narratives, as I already mentioned, is helpful when applied to modeling. Morgan talks about modeling as storytelling and I will follow the most recent work by Dry and Leach (2010) to discuss how to broaden out the modeled encounters with public health risks by acknowledging the narratives told through modeling. I will address the lack of focus on individuals' risk behavior, which was highlighted in the studies by Lofgren and Fefferman (2007) .

When governance seeks the form of modeling, we may use the metaphor of storytelling (Morgan 2001) , which allows manipulation of the world through representing it in a model and addressing questions to it. But whose story is told and whose is ignored? Who remain silent? Dry and Leach (2010) raise this issue when they argue that narratives about infectious diseases are deeply rooted in questions of power and social justice. In order to address these questions, Dry and Leach suggest analyzing the different narratives that construct disease and epidemics. Narratives for them are not just stories, but stories with purposes and consequences. In a recent study on avian influenza surveillance, Scoones (2010) identifies three ''outbreak narratives'': A narrative that links veterinary risk with agriculture, a human public health narrative, and a narrative focusing on pandemic preparedness. His analysis shows that a single narrative is perhaps not enough to create the evidence base in order to understand the multiplicity of an infectious risk from pandemic. We could see the benefits of model-based predictions in a similar way. At best they give us a single narrative, and perhaps our task is to look for other complementary ones for well-grounded risk assessment.",

A typical bias in individuals' response to risk is known as optimism bias, which means that individuals underestimate risks to themselves (Costa-Font et al. 2009 ). Joffe (2003) argues that individuals construct risks through group attachment or on the basis of their experiences in groups. She continues that response to risk is therefore ''a highly social, emotive and symbolic entity.'' Roeser's (2007) study on ethical intuitions about risks point to the same direction by acknowledging that individuals' intuitive risk judgments express ethical concerns that should be taken into account in methodologies for risk analysis or risk policy.

How social and political identities emerge from these technologies (Dean 2010, p. 217) . In this chapter, modeling techniques have been regarded as a form of technical rationality or techne in the governance of risk, which Dean defines as: ''[. . .] a search for analytical clarity concerning the techniques and instruments of government, the arts, skills and means by which rule is accomplished'' (Dean 1995, p. 560) . As I have shown, model-based predictions are ''instruments of government''; they are tools to anticipate risks, build predictive scenarios, and test mitigation strategies. At the same time, these techniques have their limitations. They easily enforce the purely probabilistic interpretation of risk, and the evidence produced by models assesses population-level risks but cannot include estimates for individual-level or address individuals' perception of risk simultaneously.

It seems to me that episteme and techne of risk rationality indicate a different direction or different dynamics of governing risks. Especially in the case of the pandemic, the risk considered to threaten the whole of population seemed to remain relatively small. Individuals made their own estimations for risk disregard to the recommendations or guidelines given by the public health officials. Those who were at risk did not consider the risk to be severe enough for them to follow the guidelines. As we can see, episteme and techne of risk rationality are pointing to the ''care of oneself and of others,'' to the ethical dimension that is present when encountering public health risks. This forms the ethos of risk rationality or the social and political identities, which emerge out of episteme and techne, out of the rationalities of governance.",

It is not a process of speculative activity, but a way in which ''governmentality'' is made up. In my reading of governance of public health risks in the two cases, risk became a ''knowable object.'' But the actors may not have reached a point what could be called ''accountability of one's own actions.'' This is an important aspect of the ethos and its formation through rationalities of governance. Dean emphasizes that ''if morality is understood as the attempt to make oneself accountable for one's own actions, or as a practice in which human beings take their own conduct to be subject to self-regulation, then government is an intensely moral activity'' (Dean 2010, p. 19 ). To recognize government as ''an intensely moral activity'' leads Dean to suggest that ''techniques and rationalities of government needs to be complemented by a fuller clarification and elaboration around third axis, that for want of a better term, we might call 'axis of self-formation''' (Dean 1995, p. 560) . So, in order to complement risk rationality and to enhance successful governance of risk, I would suggest to include all ''three axes of governmentality'' into the process.
