            "text": "The CDC just reported steep declines in the number of American children receiving their routine 11 immunizations. Data from the Vaccines for Children Program (which provides one-half of 12 federally purchased vaccines) and the Vaccine Safety Datalink, find that the US national 13 COVID19 emergency declaration on March 13, 2020 triggered a sudden drop in childhood 14 vaccinations. Within weeks, parents ceased bringing their children in to see their pediatrician 15 or family healthcare provider [1] (Fig 1) . The steepest declines included measles-containing 16 vaccines. 17 We already know that an accelerated antivaccine movement caused the return of measles to Paul Offit, and myself, among others should expect attacks. 72 Will scientists in general become increasingly targeted? The good news is that more than ever 73 before in recent US history the American public is eager to learn from scientists speak about 74 COVID19 in the mainstream media. This increased visibility is making America comfortable with 75 hearing from scientists, and this in itself is essential in combating antiscience movements [21] . 76 However, the protests and their links with extremist groups in camouflage, give us pause to 77 realize that things could also go very wrong. The weeks before the 2020 US Presidential 78 election could become a time of extreme instability in America, especially if COVID19 resurges. 79 Should this happen, poll numbers will drop for many elected leaders. They might react by 80 turning on scientists as a deflection mechanism, possibly with damaging consequences. 81 To mitigate the consequences of a reinvigorated antivaccine movement in America it will be 82 essential for the White House, together with the NIH and other elements of our science 83 infrastructure, to shape a well-crafted vaccine communication plan. They must also designate a 84 trusted spokesperson who can articulate and carry the message. 85 As COVID19 spread in the spring of 2020 my prediction was the American public would 86 recognize the urgency of developing and administering a COVID19 vaccine, causing the 87 antivaccine movement to dissipate. Tragically, the opposite has happened, and there is risk we 88 might see yet again a surge in America's antivaccine movement. ",

            "text": "temporary, or can we expect measles or other vaccine-preventable diseases to continue 22 rising? The CDC trends show that vaccinations among young children less than 24 months are23    beginning to rebound, although they remain suppressed among older children. This means that24    this year's cohort of preschool children may not receive their second dose of measles vaccine 25 making outbreaks more likely.26    In the meantime, there are further indications measles will remain a significant health threat,27    due to a confluence of antivaccine activities and new social forces set into motion because of 28 COVID19. Possibly, the antivaccine movement has grown stronger from the COVID19 29 pandemic, fueled with fresh conspiracies and new alliances.30    In the conspiracy category, the antivaccine movement builds outrageous claims that Bill Gates31 or others created COVID19 as a means to create mandatory vaccines [6]. In turn, it alleges 32 COVID19 vaccines are devices to promote the establishment of a global surveillance network, in 33 which each of us would receive an \"electronic tattoo\" through injection of a vaccine data chip 34 under the skin [7]. Or that the launch of a 5G network in Wuhan, China, created the virus or 35 damaged the immune systems of the population to make them susceptible to the SARSthe antivax lobby falsely claims the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious 38 Diseases of the US National Institutes of Health, headed by Dr. Anthony Fauci, is behind 39 COVID19 and funded the Wuhan Institute of Virology to perform gain-of-function research to 40 transform an innocuous coronavirus into the lethal and transmissible SARS CoV2 virus [9]. They 41 say Fauci and Gates profit financially from future COVID19 vaccines [10], but that even \"OG 42 (original gangster) villains\" like me or Paul Offit, \"the world's top vaccine promoters\" are 43 \"frantically warning us about the unique and frightening dangers inherent in new alliance category, the antivaccine movement has started connecting with groups and 46 individuals protesting against government interference and social distancing, working to add 47 childhood vaccination mandates to their list of grievances[12] . This is an extension of the antivaccine movement's earlier pivot to the political far right based on \"choice\" or around the rollout of COVID19 vaccines has furthered cemented antivax links. 54 The White House national vaccine program has the new name of \"Operation Warp Speed\" [16]. 55 Such science fiction imagery, together with press releases from some of the biotechs and 56 pharma companies making aggressive claims that a vaccine could be made or released within 57 weeks or months [17] raise concerns that the first COVID19 vaccines would be released far 58 ahead of the traditional timeframe. We can take comfort in the fact that regulators in the US 59 and elsewhere will not release any unsafe product, especially given the US Food and Drug 60 Administration's extraordinary track record for vaccine safety combined with a detailed system 61 of safety monitoring by the FDA and CDC [18]. 62 As both a vaccine scientist and parent of adult daughter with autism, I have confronted the 63 antivaccine movement for many years. Among their major false assertions is that vaccines 64 cause autism [13]. However, a second one is that vaccines are not adequately tested for safety 65 [19]. The communications and missteps around the rollout of COVID19 vaccines may require a 66 period of damage control. 67 In the US, COVID19 is predicted to return on an annual and seasonal basis in the postpandemic 68 period [20]. The coming months and years could become a turbulent time in America as 69 protestors step up demands to resist social distancing and find new allies in a growing 70 antivaccine movement.
