Overall, SSTIs have a higher incidence than urinary tract infections and pneumonia combined and has been steadily rising [1\u2022]. Over the past decade, there has been an increase in the incidence of SSTIs presumably due to the aging population, increase in number of immunocompromised people, and the emergence of multi-resistant pathogens [2]. Data from 2012 showed that the total cost of SSTIs in the USA alone was $13.8 billion, mostly due to hospitalizations [3]. Clearly, cutaneous infections and their management are a significant health and financial burden and providers should be educated on the most recent developments in order to provide effective, evidence-based care for their patients.",

The breadth of information and developments on cutaneous infections is vast and so the purpose of this review is to provide succinct, meaningful, and clinically relevant information to the provider for their practice. Within each discussion, we present findings from research on common and significant diseases.

Once confined to healthcare facilities, an increase in the development of MRSA has been observed in hospitals, communities, and primary care settings [6]. SSTI antibiotic resistance can mainly be attributed to antibiotic overuse; resistance has been demonstrated with multiple topical antibiotics such as fusidic acid, mupirocin, and retapamulin [6, 7, 8\u2022\u2022]. Several studies have shown that there is limited clinical data to support the widespread use of topical antibiotics in preventing infection or promoting wound healing following uncomplicated minor wounds with the exception of impetigo and nasal decolonization of S. aureus [8\u2022\u2022, 9]. Indeed, a 2015 meta-analysis concluded that nasal mupirocin may have a significant protective effect against MRSA skin infections [10]. The Choosing Wisely Campaign is an American-based educational health campaign which focuses on educating providers and patients on evidence-based medicine, including proper antibiotic use. Providers can access their website for free and look up recommendations and guidelines for antimicrobial use [11].",

A prospective hospital-based enrollment study found that early addition of a broader spectrum antibiotic on the second day of treatment in response to suboptimal outcomes on the first day of treatment was not associated with improved outcomes. This suggests that broadening of antibiotic therapy may often be premature, and that an early non-response is not indicative of suboptimal therapy. An RCT demonstrated comparable cure rates for clindamycin and TMP-SMX, however, due to the higher risk of Clostridioides difficile infection with clindamycin, TMP-SMX is recommended for oral anti-MRSA coverage of uncomplicated skin infections such as cellulitis and abscesses [35, 36]. Another RCT reported that the use of TMP-SMX and cephalexin did not result in superior clinical results when compared to cephalexin alone for the treatment of uncomplicated cellulitis [37].",

The US preventative services task force recommends screening for syphilis in asymptomatic non-pregnant individuals who may have higher risks of infection [50\u2022\u2022]. Initial screening with a non-treponemal test is recommended followed by a treponemal test such as the fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption for confirmation [51]. A study of the recently approved rapid fingerstick treponemal-based antibody test called the Syphilis Health Check reported the sensitivity and specificity of the test to be 71.4 and 91.5%, respectively.

It should be noted that although valacyclovir and famciclovir require less dosing than acyclovir, the former two are not approved for children and are more costly [72].

Isolation of HSV from surface sites of the neonate obtained greater than 12 to 24 h after birth is considered to always be a significant finding and is the most common and non-invasive method to obtain evidence of active infection with HSV [77]. All neonates born to women with active genital HSV lesions or history of HSV but no active lesions at time of delivery should be monitored for clinical evidence of HSV infection (skin or scalp rashes, conjunctival lesions, irritability, sepsis, etc.) during the first 6 weeks of life [77]. Additionally, women with herpetic breast lesions are advised not to breastfeed from affected breast until resolution of lesion [77]. The CDC advises that the administration of acyclovir be considered for neonates born to women who acquired HSV near term because the risk is high [51].",

Also, the CDC stated in 2016 that transmission of chikungunya via breast milk has not been reported and that women are encouraged to continue breastfeeding in endemic areas [104].

It is evident that the emergence of resistant strains of microorganisms in all categories described, whether it be bacteria, fungi or viruses, has driven the discovery and production of new antimicrobials which are now at the disposal of the provider. Additionally, new guidelines on treatment as well as prevention strategies are able to aid providers of how to effectively combat this resistance and provide better outcomes for their patients. Advances in diagnostics technology have also become available which can provide an accurate determination of causative agents leading to more directed therapies and potentially reduce the frequency of empiric treatment. Readers should take note of new emerging infections and newly described presentations which they may encounter in their practice. As research advances in this field, new discoveries will continue to change our understanding of basic science as well as clinical management of cutaneous infections in order to provide the most effective and safe care to patients who will be afflicted by them.",
