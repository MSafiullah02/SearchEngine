The much-quoted pronouncement that \u201cit is time to close the book on infectious disease\u201d is usually attributed to former US Surgeon General William Stewart. Although there appears to be no evidence that he ever actually said this, \u201cthe sentiment was certainly widely shared\u201d at the time (Sassetti and Rubin 2007). This widespread complacency remained largely unchallenged throughout most of the twentieth century. It was dispelled by the unfolding of HIV pandemic and the plethora of other emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases that followed (or in some cases preceded) it, but it had already contributed to the gross neglect of infectious diseases by bioethicists (Smith et al. 2004; Francis et al. 2005; Selgelid and Selgelid 2005).

Communicable diseases have implications far beyond their effects on individual sufferers and their immediate families. Because they can be rapidly fatal in previously healthy people and their spread is often unpredictable and indiscriminate, they can cause fear, panic, social disruption, political overreaction and victimization, out of proportion to the actual disease burden or risk (Smith et al. 2004). The explosive, but relatively short-lived, spread and high mortality of SARS in 2003 led to international socioeconomic repercussions affecting tourism, trade and international relations and costing billions of dollars. Disproportionate responses are often exacerbated by the florid language used by media and politicians, with analogies to terrorism or war (\u201cflesh-eating\u201d; \u201csilent killer\u201d; \u201csuperbug\u201d; \u201cplague\u201d; \u201cattack\u201d; \u201cstruck down\u201d).

The former emphasizes the right of individuals to make decisions about their health, based on their own interests or preferences (autonomy), limited only by the potential of those decisions to harm others (the harm principle). The latter is based on utilitarian principles, whereby decisions are determined by the best overall outcomes (in terms of aggregate and/or average human well-being), even if some individuals may be disadvantaged as a result. Recently, Margaret Battin and colleagues have suggested a new approach \u2013 that ethical decision-making about infectious diseases should take place behind a Rawlsian \u201cveil of ignorance\u201d, a concept developed as the basis for making fair decisions about distributive justice (Battin et al. 2009; Rawls 1971). They propose that patients with infectious diseases \u2013 and indeed anyone \u2013 can be seen, actually or potentially, as both a victim and a vector of infection (Battin et al. 2009). Behind the \u201cveil of ignorance\u201d, the decision-maker does not know her actual status \u2013 victim and/or vector \u2013 but acknowledges that she could be, or could become, either.",

Levels of susceptibility to infection vary between individuals, as determined by, inter alia, where and how they live, their age, underlying health, nutritional status, life-style choices and genetic makeup and the measures they take to protect themselves, such as immunization. No one can be reliably protected from infections due to respiratory viruses, food-borne bacteria or pathogens spread by mosquitoes. Like the patient with fever and cough or diarrhea, each of us is a potential victim and a potential vector. Ethical infectious disease policy will respect the interests of both patients with infections \u2013 who want care and protection, without discrimination \u2013 and of the rest of the community who seek protection from infection.

Differences in susceptibility to malaria and TB have been recognized between different but closely related ethnic groups (Modiano et al. 1996); and large epidemiological, twin and genetic studies have provided insights into the hereditable proportions of susceptibility or resistance to a number of infectious diseases. There are well documented associations between certain human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes and susceptibility to severe malaria, rapid progression of HIV infection to AIDS, development of overt TB disease or leprosy and hepatitis B carriage (Cooke and Hill 2001). However, HLA genes account for only a small component of genetic susceptibility to infection, which (like many other types of disease) is apparently determined by interactions between many different genes, acquired characteristics (e.g., nutrition, previous exposure) and environmental factors.",

Researchers are using the technique of genome-wide association (GWA) analysis, which involves mapping half a million or more single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in thousands of individuals \u2013 without the need for whole genome sequencing \u2013 to identify sequence variants that correlate with disease risk, using statistical inferences based on common patterns.",

As part of this assessment, the point at which clinical research \u2013 with its ethical safeguards such as the informed consent of subjects \u2013 merges into routine practice will need to be defined. We need to develop standards for interpretation and reporting of the results of new diagnostic tests, in consultation with clinicians, to improve consistency. At present, introduction of new diagnostic and screening methods generally occurs independently in individual laboratories; test evaluation is often limited to comparison with existing methods and continued satisfactory performance in quality assurance programs, as required by accreditation bodies. Differences between methods used by different accredited laboratories suggest that some are \u201cbetter\u201d than others, but this information is not readily accessible to clinicians or patients and the criteria on which choices are based are often poorly defined. New tests are usually more expensive that conventional methods. It is usually assumed \u2013 and often true \u2013 that any increased costs are justified by better patient outcomes and savings elsewhere, but formal cost-effectiveness studies that are needed to confirm this are rarely done. Even if extensive evaluation demonstrates that a new method can improve patient outcomes and/or reduce costs, introduction of the test is often prevented or delayed because of the difficulty of transferring costs (and savings) between cost centers.",

For many notifiable infectious diseases, simple species identification of the pathogen is inadequate and strain typing is required to monitor trends or to investigate outbreaks. However, until recently, the efficacy of surveillance has been limited by the fact that conventional strain typing methods are relatively slow, insensitive, and often performed only by specialized public health laboratories. Recent developments in microbial genomics have led to the development of faster and more discriminatory methods (see 10.1007/978-1-4419-1327-2_2, 10.1007/978-1-4419-1327-2_4, and 10.1007/978-1-4419-1327-2_17), but their introduction has been limited and haphazard, in part because of inadequate recognition of the importance of improved strain typing methods, for disease control.",

However, communicable disease surveillance often requires individual patient identification to allow contact tracing, outbreak investigation and the implementation of appropriate control measures and to determine the outcomes. For example, under the NSW Public Health Act, 1991 (http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/pha1991126/), disclosure of certain data is allowed, but there are strict principles governing the collection, storage, access and use of information. In practice, there is little public opposition to the notification of identifiable, personal information to health authorities for communicable disease surveillance, which is accepted as necessary in the public interest. However, this may be, in part, because current communicable disease surveillance systems are generally slow, insensitive, and nonspecific.

However, improvements in disease control, based on efficient surveillance across large populations could not be achieved if large numbers of people refused to participate because of fear that results could be misused. Denmark has one of the most advanced EPR networks, which allows individuals to block information in their records. This option is reported to be rarely exercised but greatly valued (Rothstein 2008). At present, the disclosure of health information for public benefit is often regulated by laws that are so broad that, in practice, no limits are placed on their scope. EPR networks could, paradoxically, protect privacy more effectively, by allowing limits to be imposed on the scope of data that could be accessed. Scanning software could be programmed to select only information relevant to a specific purpose, using \u2018contextual access criteria\u2019 \u2013 software algorithms which specify that, for an enquiry of type X, only data A, B, and C are needed.",

This has benefits for both potential patients and the general public who arguably have a right to information about the quality of care in hospitals to which they may be admitted in future. In some countries, data related to HAIs are publicly reported, and the occurrence of cases judged to be preventable may incur penalties. For example, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) in the USA have recently announced that they will no longer reimburse healthcare facilities for costs related to certain HAIs that could have reasonably been prevented through the use of evidence-based guidelines (http://www.idsociety.org/newsArticle.aspx?id=6,852).",

Research ethics has traditionally been a central theme of bioethics discourse, for which monitoring guidelines and procedures are well established in health and research institutions, but the ethics of disease surveillance is a relatively unexplored area in need of debate. On the one hand, there are questions about the technical similarities and/or differences between surveillance and research and how they affect practice, if at all (Fairchild and Bayer 2004). In theory, these may be the questions of definition and semantics, but there are currently major differences, which may or may not be justified, in the way these two areas are perceived by practitioners and funding bodies. From an ethical perspective, the key question is whether there are morally relevant differences between research and surveillance such that the ethical requirements for the former should not also apply to the latter. According to research ethics, for example, informed consent is paramount and the interests of the individual are supposed to take priority over those of science or society (Declaration of Helsinki - available at: http://www.wma.net/e/policy/b3.htm). Given that research and surveillance are similar insofar as both aim to generate information to promote health outcomes, the crucial questions are whether, why and how much, if at all, ethical requirements for disease surveillance should be less stringent than those of biomedical research.",
