PAMPs are unique features present in viruses that are not present in the host cell and therefore allow cells to distinguish self versus non-self to activate an immune response to infection. There are several types of PRRs that sense viral infection, including Toll-like receptors (TLRs), RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), and DNA sensors, which recognize both viral nucleic acids and proteins. Activation of these PRRs leads to signaling through adaptor proteins, such as MAVS and STING. These adaptor proteins then activate kinases and transcription factors that induce the expression of type I and III interferons (IFNs), as well as antiviral proteins (PRRs are reviewed in [1]). The antiviral innate immune signaling pathways highlighted in this review are shown in Figure 1, Figure 2, Figure 3, Figure 4\n.",

            "text": "Viruses have developed several ways to evade detection by PRRs. Many RNA viruses replicate in the cytoplasm where they are sensed by the cytoplasmic PRRs, MDA5 and RIG-I (Figure 1). In contrast, most DNA viruses replicate within the nucleus and can be sensed in the nucleus or in the cytoplasm by IFI16 or cGAS, respectively (Figure 2). Thus to avoid detection by the host innate immune system at their sites of replication, viruses have evolved several evasion strategies. For example, the positive-sense single-stranded (ss) RNA virus, dengue virus (DenV), replicates in the cytoplasm where its dsRNA would be expected to be detected by the cytoplasmic RNA sensor proteins RIG-I and MDA5 to induce type I IFN. However, new work has revealed that DenV induces membrane modifications that sequester the DenV RNA away from RIG-I and MDA5, resulting in poor induction of type I IFN [6]. It has been known for some time that hepatitis C virus (HCV), which like DenV is in the Flaviviridae family of viruses, similarly induces membrane rearrangements to house its replication machinery [7, 8]. Interestingly, it has now been suggested that similar to DenV, HCV-induced membrane rearrangement prevents recognition of HCV RNA by RIG-I [9\u2022\u2022]. Indeed, a study by Neufeldt et al., showed that HCV co-opts host nuclear pore complex proteins (NPC) to the membranous web to regulate protein transport into the replication complex. As viral proteins have cryptic nuclear localization signals they can relocalize to these sites of replication; however, as RIG-I does not, it is excluded from the sites of replication. Intriguingly, addition of a nuclear localization signal to RIG-I, allows it to sense HCV RNA and activate IFN induction, suggesting that the NPC at the membranous web acts as a regulator to determine the proteins that can access the membranous web [9\u2022\u2022]. This is the first demonstration that sequestered viral replication within rearranged cytoplasmic membranes actively prevents PRR sensing of viral RNA and the subsequent induction of IFN.",

These proteins are activated by specific PAMPs, with RIG-I recognizing ssRNA that contains a 5\u2032 triphosphate as well as short double-stranded (ds) RNA molecules, and MDA5 sensing longer dsRNA molecules (reviewed in [3]). Enteroviruses, including poliovirus (PV), coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3), and enterovirus 71 (EV-D71), are positive-sense ssRNA viruses sensed in the cytoplasm by MDA5 and RIG-I. These enteroviruses encode two proteases, 2Apro and 3Cpro, required for viral polyprotein processing. However, 2Apro and 3Cpro have also been shown to cleave MDA5 and RIG-I, respectively [10]. This demonstrates that enteroviruses have converged on common strategies to evade multiple PRRs during infection further supporting the fact that PRR sensing is critical for limiting viral replication and spread.",

One of the steps to activate RIG-I and MDA5 includes removal of inhibitory phosphorylation marks by the protein phosphatases PP1\u03b1 and PP1\u03b3 [12]. The negative-sense ssRNA viruses, measles virus (MV) and Nipah virus, both inhibit MDA5 activation through the actions of their V protein [13, 14]. The V protein, which acts as an IFN antagonist, binds PP1\u03b1 and PP1\u03b3 to prevent the dephosphorylation of MDA5 specifically during infection [13]. MV also utilizes a second strategy to prevent PP1\u03b1/\u03b3 dephosphorylation of MDA5. This strategy involves activation of a DC-SIGN signaling pathway that activates Raf1 kinase for activation of the PP1 inhibitor 1, which blocks PP1\u03b1/\u03b3 action [14].",

            "text": "Full activation of RIG-I requires the actions of a set of proteins, including TRIM25, RIPLET, and 14-3-3\u025b (reviewed in [11]). All of these proteins are targeted by viruses to prevent their activation. Both TRIM25 and RIPLET are E3 ubiquitin ligases that ubiquitinate RIG-I with K63-linked ubiquitin chains for its full activation. However, the negative-sense ssRNA virus, influenza virus, which is sensed by RIG-I [15, 16], evades the actions of both TRIM25 and Riplet [17, 18]. The viral NS1 protein binds to both TRIM25 and Riplet in a species-specific manner [18]. This prevents the activation of RIG-I during infection leading to a decreased induction of IFN [17, 18]. Recently, it was shown that the HCV NS3-4A protease complex, which has long been known to cleave MAVS and TRIF (see below) [19, 20, 21, 22, 23], also cleaves RIPLET to inhibit induction of IFN [24]. The 14-3-3\u025b protein, which binds to RIG-I to mediate translocation of RIG-I from the cytoplasm to interact with MAVS at intracellular membranes [25], is also inhibited by viruses. The 14-3-3\u025b protein binds proteins like RIG-I that contain phosphorylated serine or threonine at an Rxx(pS/pT)xP motif. Interestingly, the NS3 proteases of both DenV and West Nile virus (WNV) bind to 14-3-3\u025b via a phosphomimetic RxEP motif, suggesting that NS3 competitively inhibits RIG-I binding to 14-3-3\u025b, thus blocking translocation to MAVS to prevent induction of antiviral innate immunity [26\u2022\u2022].",

The cytoplasmic PRR cGAS senses viral DNA in the cytoplasm (reviewed in [27]). During HIV-1 and HIV-2 infection, the viral complementary DNA (cDNA) within the virion is sensed by cGAS after infection [28]. However, the HIV-1 but not HIV-2 cDNA is protected within the viral capsid until it is transported into the nucleus for replication. The mechanism behind this protection is due to affinity of the HIV-1, but not HIV-2, capsid with the host protein cycophilin A (CypA) which stabilizes the viral capsid to prevent exposure of the viral cDNA to cGAS in the cytoplasm [28]. In addition to cGAS, viruses target IFI16, which senses DNA viruses that replicate in the nucleus. In particular, the herpes simplex virus-1 (HSV-1) immediate early protein ICP0 has E3 ubiquitin ligase activity that ubiquitinates IFI16, resulting in its degradation by the ubiquitin proteasome and loss of IFN induction [27, 29].",

In particular, the NS3-4A protease of HCV blocks antiviral signaling by cleaving at least three innate immune signaling molecules. The HCV NS3-4A protease prevents activation of the transcription factor IRF3 and induction of IFN by cleaving the signaling adaptor protein MAVS [19, 20, 21, 23]. The NS3-4A protease can also cleave TRIF, an adaptor protein for TLR3, a protein that senses viral dsRNA in the endosome [22]. Finally, as described above, NS3-4A also cleaves RIPLET [24]. As the HCV NS3-4A protease cleaves two molecules in the RIG-I signaling pathway (both RIPLET and MAVS), this suggests that either the virus is ensuring that the RIG-I pathway is inhibited or that RIPLET may have additional functions within innate immunity besides activating RIG-I.",

While the mechanism of how STING senses RNA viruses remains unclear, the fact that multiple RNA viruses have strategies to antagonize its function suggests that it must play a role in IFN induction during RNA virus infection (reviewed in [40]). Flaviviridae virus infection may damage mitochondria, leading to the releases of mitochondrial DNA that primes the innate immune response [41\u2022\u2022].

The human poxvirus, molluscum contagiosum virus (MCV), a DNA virus, also evades IFN induction by using its MC132 protein to recruit the Elongin B/Elongin C/Cullin-5 ubiquitin ligase complex to ubiquitinate and degrade the p65 subunit of NF\u03baB to prevent its activation [47]. To antagonize the transcriptional induction of the IFN response pathway, several viruses directly act on the STAT proteins. Both STAT1 and STAT2 are phosphorylated following IFN signaling thereby promoting their interaction with IRF9 to form the ISGF3 complex that transcriptionally activates ISGs (Figure 3). In particular, the DenV NS5 protein targets STAT2 for degradation, resulting in the ubiquitination and degradation of STAT2 [48]. Additionally, the HCV core protein dysregulates STAT1 signaling by increasing the levels of non-phosphorylated STAT1 in the cell [49].

These ISGs have broad mechanisms to confer antiviral activity [50]. In this section, we will focus on how viruses evade the antiviral actions of the ISGs IFIT1 and PKR (Figure 4). The IFIT proteins bind to uncapped RNA to prevent their translation. While many viruses have uncapped RNA and use internal ribosome entry sites for their translation (e.g. HCV), some viruses have evolved ways to cap their RNA to evade IFIT1 recognition. For example, Lassa fever virus and influenza virus snatch caps from host mRNAs. Additionally, many viruses encode proteins that can perform these capping functions (reviewed in [51]). In particular, the WNV NS5 protein contains 2\u2032-Omethyltransferase (2\u2032O-MT) activity to generate a cap 1 structure. This particular cap structure is not sensed by IFIT1 during infection therefore this allows the virus to evade restriction by IFIT1 [52]. Coronaviruses, positive-sense ssRNA viruses, also encode a 2\u2032O-MT protein, nsp16 [53]. Similar to the MT activity of WNV NS5A, the MT activity of nsp16 is required for evasion of IFIT sensing during both murine hepatitis virus and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection [52, 54]. Vaccinia virus, a DNA virus that replicates exclusively in the cytoplasm, also has a 2\u2032O-MT and disruption of its activity results in increased susceptibility of vaccinia virus to IFIT protein restriction [52]. Taken together, many viruses evade the actions of IFIT1, demonstrating that IFIT1 has the capacity for potent restriction of viral replication.",

Activation of this ISG by dsRNA results in PKR autophosphorylation, dimerization, and phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 leading to decreased protein synthesis due to translational inhibition. This inhibition of translation affects both host and viral mRNAs, which ultimately decreases viral replication. A recent example of inhibition of PKR function was described during infection with human cytomegalovirus virus (HCMV), a DNA virus of the herpesvirus family [56]. This virus encodes two proteins, pTRS1 and pIRS1, that antagonize PKR to prevent its autophosphorylation and subsequent phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1. Importantly, deletion of the viral pTRS1 and pIRS1 proteins leads to decreased expression of viral early and late proteins, resulting in decreased viral replication [56]. This suggests that these proteins are critical for HCMV to prevent the antiviral activity of PKR for its replication.",

Viruses have several strategies to evade IFN induction and signaling to avoid the antiviral mechanisms of the host innate immune system. In fact, some viruses utilize multiple strategies to evade antiviral innate immune signaling, as is seen with HCV. This virus evades RIG-I detection of its replicating RNA in the membranous web by co-opting the NPC to regulate protein trafficking to the these sites of replication [9\u2022\u2022]. It also cleaves MAVS, TRIF, and RIPLET to prevent downstream signaling to IRF3 and NF\u03baB [19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24]. Further, it induces mitophagy to limit IFN induction and it also inhibits the transcription factor STAT1 to prevent ISG induction [42, 49].
