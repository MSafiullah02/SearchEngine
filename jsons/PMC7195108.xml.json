The World Health Organization (WHO) officially named the disease caused by the novel coronavirus as Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). As of March 10, 2020, COVID-19 had affected 113702 patients, causing 4012 deaths, constituting a major global health concern [2]. With the spread of the epidemic, the etiology, epidemiology, and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 have gradually been recognized, but information about the early diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 has derived mainly from adult cases. The clinical characteristics and epidemiological information of COVID-19 in children is still limited, with only sporadic literature reported [[3], [4], [5]], and more medical case information is required. Here, we summarize the clinical data from 10 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in children.",

            "text": "Currently, there are few reports of children with COVID-19. From our results and from the literature, many differences are evident between child and adult cases in terms of the epidemiology and clinical characteristics [5,[8], [9], [10]]. Severe cases in adults usually result in dyspnea after 1 week of onset, which can quickly progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), septic shock, difficult to correct metabolic acidosis, and coagulation dysfunction [11]. The absolute value of lymphocytes in most patients decreases [12]. Another study reported that the most common laboratory abnormalities in critically ill adult patients were decreased lymphocyte count, prolonged prothrombin time, and elevated lactate dehydrogenase [8]. Compared with adults, pediatric cases have generally presented with mild clinical symptoms of short duration [5,13]. This result was also confirmed in our study in which two cases were asymptomatic, four cases presented a fever, three cases showed respiratory symptoms, one case showed fever convulsions, one case involved vomiting, and one case presented with abdominal pain. There were no severe cases. The results of this study showed that children with COVID-19 had no high-risk factors such as decreased lymphocyte counts, prolonged prothrombin time, or elevated lactate dehydrogenase. This also means that pediatric patients become less ill and recover faster. It is noteworthy that patient D was admitted to the hospital with a fever. After 6 days of treatment, the nucleic acid results from throat swab samples were negative twice consecutively (with an interval of 1 day). However, the child presented with bloating and constipation symptoms during this time. We further tested the nucleic acid from stool swabs (15 days after the onset), and the results were positive for 7 consecutive days. Two other children showed persistently positive stool swab samples. This means that even after removing the virus from the respiratory tract, viral gastrointestinal infection and potential fecal\u2013oral transmission will continue. Therefore, hand hygiene is especially important for children, and routine detection of throat swabs and stool swabs should be more accurate than throat swabs alone.",

This was consistent with a number of previous studies [5,16]. The grand-uncle of patient E was the first-generation case, and the maternal grandfather and father showed onset of disease after 4 days of exposure, but the maternal grand-uncle remained asymptomatic despite a positive nucleic acid test until 9 days later. Patients G and J from family clusters with COVID-19 were both asymptomatic. Based on these results, it appears that the infection rate in children is not lower than that in adults and that children are susceptible within families with clustered disease onset. Compared with adults, however, the clinical symptoms are generally mild and children recover faster. The low incidence among children may be related to local governments initiating the highest-level response to this public health emergency. During such a response, outdoor activities are limited, minimizing the likelihood of coming into contact with the virus. However, more data are needed on inference analysis to confirm this. Based on the existing evidence from SARS-COV-2 infections in children [[16], [17], [18]], it is necessary to close schools and childcare facilities within the endemic zone to reduce the exposure of children to the potential community spread of COVID-19.",

More data on pediatric patients are expected in the future, which will help pediatricians develop a more comprehensive understanding of the characteristics of COVID-19 in children. In summary, SARS-COV-2 infection has distinctive characteristics in children, such as transmission among household family members and persistent excretion of SARS-COV-2 virus. We propose that the results of stool swab tests are included in the criteria for hospital discharge and release from isolation.",
