            "text": "Gliomas are the most frequently diagnosed intracranial malignancies with high morbidity and mortality in worldwide (de Robles et al., 2015). They are characterized by rapid metastasis and aggressive infiltration, leading to poor prognosis (Diksin, Smith, & Rahman, 2017; Ostrom et al., 2014). According to World Health Organization Classification of Tumors of the Central Nervous System proposed in 2016, glioblastoma (GBM) is the most common type of malignant gliomas, and the mean survival time of GBM patients is only approximately 15 months, even after systematic treatments (Lara\u2010Velazquez et al., 2017; Louis et al., 2016). Growing evidence have demonstrated that the malignant degree of gliomas may be attributed to various genetic and epigenetic alterations in tumorigenesis (Masui, Kato, Sawada, Mischel, & Shibata, 2017; Tsankova & Canoll, 2014). Exploring the molecular mechanisms underlying the aggressive progression of glioma may provide the novel therapeutic targets for the fatal cancer.",

            "text": "Poly(C) binding protein 2 (PCBP2), a RNA\u2010binding protein with 39 kDa, can regulate RNA stabilization, translational silencing and enhancement (Collier, Goobar\u2010Larsson, Sokolowski, & Schwartz, 1998; Wan et al., 2016). It contains three K homology domains employed as the main RNA recognized regions (Chen et al., 2016; Leffers, Dejgaard, & Celis, 1995). Dysregulation of PCBP2 may damage multiple biological processes through RNA\u2010binding pathways. For instance, PCBP2 could regulate the genome circularization and replication of various RNA viruses, like norovirus (Lopez\u2010Manriquez et al., 2013), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses (SARS\u2010CoV; Shi et al., 2014), poliovirus (Walter, Parsley, Ehrenfeld, & Semler, 2002), and hepatitis C virus (Li, Masaki, Shimakami, & Lemon, 2014). The upregulation of PCBP2 may contribute to the formation of ribosomal initiation complex, thus enhancing the replication of virus (Asnani, Pestova, & Hellen, 2016). Additionally, PCBP2 could regulate cell growth, migration and invasion (Chen et al., 2018; Mao et al., 2016). The abnormalities in PCBP2 expression have been observed in several cancers, such as gastric cancer (Chen et al., 2018) and hepatocellular carcinoma (Zhang et al., 2016). In glioma, it has been reported that the knockdown of PCBP may inhibit tumor cell proliferation and growth (Tang, Gao, & Chen, 2015). PCBP2 may act as an oncogene in etiology of glioma. However, the molecular mechanisms of PCBP2 in glioma progression was poorly known.",

We found that the knockdown of PCBP2 might lead to high expression of FHL3 and low activity of TGF\u2010\u03b2/Smad signaling pathway in glioma cells. Besides, the expression of FHL3 did not obviously influence the expression of PCBP2. Therefore, FHL3 might be a downstream target gene of PCBP2 in glioma. Moreover, the vivo mice experiment also verified the results in our study. A gene chip assay performed by Han et al. also indicated the link between PCBP2 and FHL3 in glioma progression (Han et al., 2013). PCBP2 may bind to 3\u2032UTR of FHL3 gene (Han, Xia, Yin, & Peng, 2014). It has been reported to bind several target genes in diseases. PCBP2 could regulate CDK2 via direct 3\u2032UTR binding in gastric cancer patients, which might be used as a potential biomarker for the therapy of gastric cancer (Chen et al., 2018). Xin et al. also reported that PCBP2 could promote the antiviral activity of IFN\u2010\u03b1 against HCV by stabilizing the mRNA of STAT1 and STAT2 (Xin et al., 2011). In addition, we found that the inhibition of FHL3 expression might enhance TGF\u2010\u03b2/Smad signaling pathway activity in glioma cells which were transfected by si\u2010PCBP2. FHL3 protein belongs to LIM\u2010only proteins family and can enhance phosphorylation and unclear accumulation of Smad proteins, thereby leading to the activation of tumor suppressor p21 and repression of oncogene c\u2010myc (Ding et al., 2009). In the current study, we also found that knockdown of FHL3 could reverse the tumor\u2010suppressive effects caused by PCBP2 silencing expression in glioma. Therefore, PCBP2 may activate TGF\u2010\u03b2/Smad signaling pathway through suppressing FHL3, thus contributing to the progression of glioma.",
