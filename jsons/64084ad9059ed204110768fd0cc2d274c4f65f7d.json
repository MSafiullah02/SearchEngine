(1, 2) This comes in the wake of an \"infodemic\" with evolving scientific knowledge about infections being generated daily, which has led to reversals in infection prevention recommendations made within a short span of time. (2) (3) (4) For example, the use of cloth masks during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic was discouraged by the World Health Organisation due to uncertainty about its efficacy. (3) However, its potential use in slowing the spread of COVID-19 has led to subsequent recommendations by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for it to be worn by healthy individuals. (4) The ease of access to information via social and online media platforms has also become a double-edged sword in this pandemic where there has been substantial propagation of misinformation. (5) Faced with the continuous influx of information related to this pandemic, an individual's level of health literacy exerts a vital role in one's ability to acquire, discern and understand accurate medical information.",

(8) In the setting of non-communicable diseases, the association between health literacy with increased healthcare costs, morbidity and mortality is well-established. (9) The equal importance of health literacy in communicable diseases was highlighted in the recent COVID-19 crisis and previous coronavirus pandemics such as the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS). (1, 10) In contrast to general health literacy required for the prevention or management of chronic diseases, these pandemics require an individual's readiness and adaptive ability in developing their pandemic related and critical health literacy quickly. This is critical as the rapid and successful implementation of infectious diseases control measures requires the collective compliance of all individuals. (11, 12) Network (SSRN) were extracted for evaluation. Keywords employed in the search strategy included terms related to health literacy as well as the viruses and syndromes implicated in the three coronavirus pandemics which were namely COVID-19, MERS and SARS. Terms related to health literacy were adapted from reviews which evaluated health literacy in other patient populations. (18, 19) The full search strategy was detailed in Supplementary File 1. The start date of the search was unrestricted and current as of 22 April 2020.",

As there are no gold-standard health literacy instruments developed for COVID-19, SARS or MERS(21), significant heterogeneity is expected in the types of tools used for assessment of health literacy across participants. Consequently, meta-analysis could not be performed. Questions from instruments used across included studies were classified into three main themes, which were 1) knowledge, 2) attitudes and 3) practices, to help guide future development of standardised COVID-19 and pandemic health literacy tools. The analyses were segregated by medical and non-medical populations due to the expected differing levels of health literacy in the two populations. For studies where the questionnaires were not available, study authors were contacted for the questionnaire. If there were no replies from the authors, the themes were extracted from the description of the questionnaires in the main text. A framework for core items to be included in pandemic health literacy tools was also proposed based on common themes assessed across studies.",

Sociodemographic factors which were commonly associated with better health literacy included higher educational level (23, 26, 27, 33, 34, 36, 37, 39, 40, 42, 43, 45, 72-77, 80-82, 88, 89) , increased age (23, 26, 30, 37, 40, 43, 48, 50, 63, 65, 72, 74, 75, 78, 84, 85) and female gender (13, 16, 23, 26, 33, 34, 38, 40, 41, 44, 45, 60, 62, 72, 74, 78, 80, 81, 84, 85, 89) . For health systems-based factors, increased experience in the healthcare system (48, 56, 63, 76, 77, 89) and attendance in health education programs (28, 33, 58, 60, 71, 78) were associated with better health literacy. For medical and psychiatric/psychological factors, increased general health literacy (13, 30) and increased anxiety about the spread of infection (28, 33, 80, 84) were associated with better health literacy. Lastly, other factors 1 1 associated with better health literacy included the use of traditional sources of information such as newspaper or television (28, 33, 75) .",

It was modelled after psychosocial models of health behaviours and encompassed key topics which were frequently evaluated in instruments across the three pandemics.

However, the findings from this review should also be interpreted with the following limitations. Firstly, while we adopted a reasonably comprehensive search strategy, potentially relevant articles may have been missed. Finger searching within the references of included articles was performed to minimize this omission of potentially relevant articles. Secondly, we were only able to include articles in the English language due to the language limitations of the authors. Thirdly, we were not able to perform meta-analyses for the overall level of pandemic related health literacy and their determinants due to the heterogeneity in instruments. With the development of a standardised instrument for the assessment of health literacy related to pandemics, future studies should consider using meta-analyses to compare the level of health literacy across different populations. Lastly, the full questionnaires could not be accessed for 27 studies. While themes described in the main text of these articles were carefully extracted, we could not rule out the omission of themes which were not described. Future health literacy studies should append their questionnaires to allow meaningful evaluation of the study results.",

Important determinants associated with better levels of health literacy such as older age, female gender, employment status and education level were highlighted in this review.

To our best knowledge, this is the first review to summarise health literacy in the COVID-19, SARS and MERS pandemics. Overall, the level of health literacy related to COVID-19 and other pandemics remains sub-optimal in both medical and non-medical populations. Given the important role health literacy plays in stemming the spread of infection and mitigating the impacts of these pandemics, there is an urgent need for the design of interventions to rapidly enhance the pandemic related health literacy of the population. Within the field of health literacy for non-communicable diseases, both single and mixed strategies encompassing interventions such as alternative readability and document design, alternative numerical presentation, pictorial representation and use of alternative media have been employed.(90) Alternative document design has been adapted in the construction of health information websites where the use of simple designs, minimization of lengthy text and medical jargon use have been shown to enhance health literacy among users.(91) These interventions are relevant and should be adapted for pandemic related health literacy.(90) In the current information technology era, websites, web-based applications and mobile applications serve important vehicles for the dissemination of critical pandemic related information. A review by Kim et al. highlighted readability and other resource-specific factors e.g. accessibility, interactivity and comprehensiveness as barriers to online health information users.(92) Of note, the readability of most online health resources exceeded the recommended sixth-grade reading level.(92) The readability of online health resources related to the COVID-19 has not been evaluated, and future researchers should consider utilizing instruments such as Simplified Measure of Gobbledygook or Flesch Reading Ease for the evaluation of these resources.(93, 94)",

For example, one of the questions in the survey used by Moro et al. described the practice of not travelling to China as the only correct answer for preventing oneself from contracting COVID-19, amidst potentially correct answers such as avoiding crowded places. While this was understandable as the study was conducted in the early stages of COVID-19 outbreak prior to the implementation of social distancing measures, it showcases the importance of being up-to-date with the latest pandemic related information for researchers designing future health literacy trials. Studies that are ongoing within the midst of pandemics should also check regularly that the items within questionnaires and their answers reflect the current state of the evidence, as emerging new information may lead to inaccuracies in the assessment of health literacy. With the implementation of lockdowns in countries to prevent the transmission of COVID-19, the use of online surveys and questionnaires has been increasingly used for pandemic related health literacy research. The results of these studies should be evaluated carefully given the following limitations. Firstly, as the recruited participants are limited to those who are keyboard literate,",

Pertaining to the role of gender, females have identified in multiple studies to have higher general health literacy levels as compared to their male counterparts.(99, 100) This difference may be related to the traditional roles that females play in caring for family members and children, which increase their need and familiarity with navigating and interacting with healthcare information and systems.(101) Employment creates opportunities for individuals to access healthcare resources..(17) Likewise, the education attainment plays an important role in health literacy through its influence on knowledge, skills and resource interpretation and utilization.(10, 102) Interestingly, while older age has been associated with poorer health literacy in the general population possibly due to ageing-related factors such as cognitive decline and physical impairments(103), our review showed that older age was associated with better health literacy. This may be related to the greater number of pandemics an older person experience in his lifetime where prior knowledge gained from previous pandemics may shape their ability to gather, synthesize and comprehend information related to ongoing pandemics.(10, 104) Another potential reason for this finding could be related to increased selection bias among older participants as compared to studies performed for general health literacy. While our review has highlighted multiple determinants of pandemic related health literacy, more studies are required to understand the complex interplay between these factors and their impact on health literacy. In our review, there were no studies which evaluated clinical outcomes associated with poor pandemic related health literacy. Poor general health literacy has been linked to adverse clinical outcomes such as increased healthcare utilization and morbidity.(105) In addition, people with low general health literacy are more likely to delay or forego medical treatment, compared to their counterparts with adequate health literacy.(106) While it is expected that people with poor pandemic related health literacy may have poorer clinical outcomes, this remains a significant research gap that should be addressed in future studies.",
