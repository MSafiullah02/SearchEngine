Some participants offered to keep their scheduled visit regardless of risk. Some were angry and others expressed sadness. Nearly all participants were eager to continue on their medication (or perhaps placebo), even if this meant learning how to attend a virtual visit or drive to another site. The imminent risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2, the virus responsible for COVID-19, in our multi-vulnerable population has made some decisions seem obvious, such as safety over research.

Sites followed hospital and local IRB policy, or in some cases helped their hospitals to develop such policy.

In response to the pandemic, study clinicians and participants began experimenting with virtual visits; safety checks and assessments were retooled, infusions were delayed indefinitely, and enrollment was halted.

Out of necessity we formed triage processes dividing ongoing or upcoming projects into one of two categories based on the premise of 1) safety first, and 2) some data is better than no data. With regard to safety prioritization, the first question was whether or not the visit or participant-involving task was truly necessary to perform without delay for patient safety or primary study outcomes.

When in-person visits were halted, telemedicine and virtual visits were anticipated as emergent gap-fills (6) . Several sponsors advised the GPRP to conduct phone visits if in-person visits were unable to continue, emphasizing participant safety and changes in concomitant medications. Beyond obvious limitations imposed by the virtual visit, such as performing physical exams, geriatric subjects offer additional challenges, such as lack of access or discomfort or inexperience with technology, challenges with the transitions in care (7), and population-specific comorbidities, such as hearing or vision loss. Another issue specific to these geriatric studies is the role of the study partner / caregiver: Isolation strategies have, in some cases, prevented study partners from connecting with subjects. This creates a dual challenge, as not only do study partners assist with coordinating visits, but one of their primary roles in several clinical studies is study partner assessment; study partners, who contribute significantly to behavioral and cognitive assessments during visits, are intended to have contact with the subject a minimum of two days per week, which is less of a problem when the partner is a spouse or lives in the home with the subject. However, several study partners are adult children or other relatives of the subject and have been restricted from visitation, either to the home or assisted living facility, rendering their role in assessment less valid. Finally, many of the key staff, such as nurses and nurse practitioners who originally performed in-person visits have been redeployed towards emergency measures such as working at pop-up COVID-19 surge respiratory clinics.",

Safety visits often include vital signs, blood tests, ECGs and neuroimaging (e.g. to evaluate for amyloid-related imaging abnormalities [ARIA]). Once in-person safety lab draws at Mass General Hospital's main campus in Boston became unavailable, our coordinators steered subjects to other institutional locations, which, days later, were shuttered to nonurgent appointments. Contracting with commercial labs was another alternative. This too presented difficulty, as were initially dedicating total resources to COVID-19; however, many have since reopened their services more broadly. Even this viable alternative was imperfect: smaller pharmaceutical sponsors were hesitant to reimburse the growing costs associated with outsourcing their studies. Given their limited budgets, any serious interruptions or extensions of the study could spell bankruptcy. And participants needed to agree to changes as well; when offered the option to obtain vitals and lab draws through a contract organization, some subjects and caregivers adjusted while others felt that this was still too risky, and that self-quarantine was the only safe option. Thus, the question being asked at all levels is how much we can widen the window of tolerance around missed safety visits (weeks? months?), before continuing treatment becomes unsafe? As the lapse in infusions and / or safety visits extends beyond initial expectations, contingency plans are reshaping into amended IRB protocols, and some sponsors (as of late April) are establishing site-spanning guidelines for upper limits of missed months of infusions, and maximal deviations from set infusion windows.",

To date, there is little existing data regarding systematic differences in measurement error between in-person versus virtual test administration in a clinical trial context. Neuropsychological testing inherently does not lend itself well to deviations in administration procedures, and accounting for potential inconsistencies related to virtual versus in-person testing across and within trial sites and participants would be a significant challenge. As an example, the Alzheimer's Disease Composite Score (ADCOMS), has been at least partially validated for use in the online setting (15), yet one component of ADCOMS, the Mini-Mental State Examination, relies heavily on orientation questions (10 points out of 30). On the MMSE, an addition of 5 points to each subject's score for relaying their home address (over-learned information), or loss of points for not knowing the date or day of the week, which may or may not be true disorientation given the blurring-together of days for many under self-quarantine, could drastically and systematically skew the interpretation of outcomes.",

We also have an opportunity to realize more consistent longitudinal data collection in the face of unpredictable hurdles, such as halted drug administration. As many of the hopeful drug candidates target the long-term course of disease, collecting a more thorough dataset through convenience should confer a more accurate statistical assessment of drug effect over time. Some novel computerized assessment platforms and novel test designs have also shown immense promise over the last several years (e.g., \"gameification\").

However, other results caution against assuming preserved cognitive benefits after stopping infusions. In March 2019, Eisai and Biogen announced that they would initiate an open-label extension of Study 201, a Phase II Clinical Trial of BAN2401, an anti-A\u03b2 protofibril antibody, based on efficacy findings of decreased rate of progression of disease (ADCOMS) at 18 mo in subjects treated with high-dose (10mg/kg infusions) monthly or biweekly BAN2401 (20) . After an average two years post stopping infusions, in order to establish a baseline for the extension study, drug-and placebo-treated subjects from the previous study were re-tested at the neurocognitive level, and the drug-treated subjects were shown to have regressed to disease progression rates of the placebo-treated subjects.

As there are currently no FDA-approved disease-modifying therapies for Alzheimer's disease, volunteers participating in clinical trials for a potential disease-modifying drug often endorse the same goal: \"Let me do everything in my power to take back control of this disease or help others who come after me.\" What's more, both subjects and caregivers describe a sense of community and social support through participation in the trials. A 2019 retrospective study by McLean researchers (unpublished) on subjects and study partners who participated in the EMERGE trial found that subjects placed high value on the clinical care received on a regular basis in the course of their research participation. They felt that participation offered a recurrent source of hope each month, while caregivers found the experience to benefit their partner's mood, provided social contact and support, and was a comfortable place to talk about Alzheimer's Disease. Further, when EMERGE abruptly ended in March 2019, study partners / caregivers, even more than subjects, felt a sudden loss of social support (Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support, MSPSS) and hope, expressing both disappointment and a return to states of relative helplessness (unpublished). In the wake of COVID-19, when enrollment has ceased, and infusions are delayed until an unknown time, subjects and study partners wonder about the hope they've invested into the process. In the wake of such sweeping changes, the GPRP is in the process of establishing a virtual support group where caregivers can join together with clinicians and researchers to address ways of caring for their loved ones and themselves, as well as combat loneliness and isolation associated with self-quarantine. It is also an opportunity for the caregivers to receive updated news and safety recommendations by clinicians in a group format.",

In the wake of the pandemic, what damages to ongoing studies will need managing, and what lessons will we have learned? Trial protocols are thoughtfully written to account for most anticipated deviations. Now, they must consider how to statistically and interpretively evaluate variable interruptions in treatment administration, delayed or missed safety visits, or delays or high-volume losses of endpoint measurements. Shifting neurocognitive assessment approaches midway through a study has not been validated and will have been applied inconsistently. While these changes borne of necessity will surely take the field to the era of virtual assessments faster than we would have arrived there otherwise, the cost of abruptly switching technological approach may be the loss of inertia towards our primary research objectives. Given the nascency of telehealth and TeleNP specifically, we are still a long way from establishing fully remote virtual assessment as a feasible and reliable option in AD clinical trials.

Staff, in the meantime, began receiving a deluge of COVID-19-related emails, filled with questions of availability of continued infusions and anxiety regarding risk of exposure. Based on the many concerns of caregiver, patient and staff related to a growing risk of community exposure in the context of a voluntary clinical trial, the GPRP team decided to halt infusions. Research coordinators reached out to each of the subject-caregiver dyads to inform them that subsequent infusions, imaging, and cognitive assessment visits were placed on hold, with plans for reassessment in late April. On March 16th, MGH research wet labs and imaging programs were told that within four days all operations and human subjects research with few exceptions would shut down for at least 6-8 weeks. In response ACTRU took similar bottom-up actions as GPRP, suspending its own studies that could be suspended or judiciously adapting sponsored studies in the absence of guidance from sponsors reluctant to risk breaching IRB or FDA guidelines too unclear to interpret for their individual studies. This left the sites operating under hospital guidelines only. Once the ACTRU proposed novel approaches, the sponsors demonstrated varying degrees of rigidity in the approval process. For instance, with regard to virtual visit planning, two sponsors responded differently to solutions proposed by the ACTRU, leading to variable standards and added administrative efforts.",

            "text": "The two major neuropsychological and psychiatric outcome measure categories in most AD trials are interview-based cognitive scales (i.e. self-or informant-rated) and performance-based cognitive tests.Interview-based scales can be used on telehealth platforms with minimal to no deviation from standardized administration procedures. One important consideration, however, is the assessment of suicidality (e.g. the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (17) , which requires additional planning on the part of the trial site and/or sponsor to ensure appropriate risk management from the remote setting.Adapting performance-based cognitive tests to a telehealth platform is more challenging than interviewbased measures. There is a growing literature supporting the validity and feasibility of virtual neuropsychological assessment (9), including in older patients with cognitive impairment (10 -12) . Tests that are auditory / verbal in nature are most amenable to virtual platforms. For example, a recent review found that tasks requiring a verbal response, including digit span, verbal fluency, and list-learning, were not meaningfully affected by videoconference administration (9) . Some tasks requiring visual presentation of materials, such as the Boston Naming Test (BNT), also performed on par with in-person administration.By contrast, there was more variability in results for tests that had a stronger visuomotor component (e.g., Clock Drawing) and may require further retooling to be successfully implemented. These test-specific findings are significant because measures of verbal memory and language have been shown to yield high predictive accuracy in terms of progression from mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's dementia (18) .Notably, a recent study examining two global measures of cognition commonly used in AD clinical trialsthe MMSE and ADAS-Cogfound no differences between in-person and videoconference administration, except in inpatients with more pronounced cognitive deficits (MMSE<17) (18) . One final consideration worth noting relates to the use of so-called \"synchronous\" testsi.e., tests for which administration might be negatively affected by technological disruption during administration (9) . Tests that include a timed component, or those with single trials (e.g. digit span, Stroop task, list learning) could be significantly affected by audio and/or video latencies, whereas other non-time dependent tasks and those with more relaxed rules about repeating instructions (e.g. BNT, Figure Copy and Recall) are less susceptible to technological interference.",
