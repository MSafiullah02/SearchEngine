Since its first recognition in the late 1970s (Chasey and Cartwright, 1978, Pensaert and De Bouck, 1978), PED has continued to cause a severe economic impact in swine industry worldwide. At present, PED has been reported as re-emerging disease worldwide (Chen et al., 2014, Dennis et al., 2015, Lee et al., 2014, Lin et al., 2014, Masuda et al., 2015, Ojkic et al., 2015, Theuns et al., 2015, Vui et al., 2015).",

            "text": "PED virus (PEDV), a causative agent of PED, is an enveloped single-stranded positive-sense RNA virus belonging to the genus Alphacoronavirus, family Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales. At present, two PEDV variants including genogroups 1 and 2 are currently recognized (Lee, 2015, Sun et al., 2015). The PEDV genome is consisting of seven open reading frames (ORFs) organizing in order as following; ORF1a and ORF1b, spike (S), ORF3, envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleoprotein (N) (Kocherhans et al. 2001). Two-thirds of the genome is occupied by ORF1a and ORF1b, which encode nonstructural proteins. The other 4 structural proteins including S, E, M, and N are located downstream of the ORF1a/1b gene. The S protein is a glycosylated protein involving with viral pathogenesis and be further divided into S1 and S2 domains. The S protein attaches to the host cellular receptors resulting to virus entry by membrane fusion (Bosch et al. 2003) and contains domain that stimulates the production of neutralizing antibodies (Chang et al., 2002, Cruz et al., 2006, Cruz et al., 2008, Duarte and Laude, 1994, Sun et al., 2008, Sun et al., 2007). The S gene is divergent and important for understanding the genetic relatedness of PEDV field strains, the epidemiological status of the virus and vaccine development (Li et al., 2012, Park et al., 2011, Sun et al., 2012). ORF3 encodes an accessory protein located between S and E. In addition, the ORF3 gene is the only accessory gene, and has been an important determinant of virulence in PEDV (Park et al. 2008). The vaccine-derived strains have unique deletion of 17 amino acids at position 82 to 99 (Park et al. 2008). The other E and M genes are associated with viral envelope formation and release. The N protein is the predominant antigen produced in coronavirus-infected cells, making it a major viral target (Kocherhans et al. 2001).",

A previous study demonstrated that those PEDV stains in G1a group were vaccine-like stains (Cheun-Arom et al. 2015). The emergence of PEDV variants in this group was due to the heavy use of modified live PEDV vaccines, both modified live (MLV) and killed virus (KV) vaccines during 2013\u20132014. At present, the use of MLV and KV in Thailand drastically decreased compared to 2013\u20132014. This was due to the efficacy of intramuscular vaccines in which provided a limited degree of success against PED. In addition, MLV was reported to cause PEDV outbreaks with mild clinical disease (Cheun-Arom et al. 2015). The emergence of a US-like variant as shown in G2b group (TH6), was indeed intriguing and this is the first report showing the emergence of US-like PEDV in Thailand. TH6 is the latest subgroup in which contained the new introduction of the exotic PEDV strain (P1915-NPF-071511A) in 2015 that belong to G2b or US-like subgroup. This sequence share 100% similarity with NIG-1/JPN/2014, GNM-2/JPN/2014, MIE-1/JPN/2014, PC21A, KUIDL-PED-2014-002, KUIDL-PED-2014-007, USA/Ohio75/2013, USA/Ohio69/2013, USA/Ohio60/2013, and USA/Indiana/17846/2013, suggesting the first US-like strain in Thailand. However, the abilities of this strain to develop into the endemic strain in the Thai swine industry was still questionable and further investigation is required to monitor the development of these exotic strains.",

However, although multiple introduction was evident, those strains were yet to form their own clusters. In contrast, Thai PEDV developed its own cluster separated from other countries. PEDV variants that has been dominant in Thai swine farms are strains in G2a group and can be further divided into 2 subgroups including TH1 and TH2. We found that Thailand strains are unique and underwent mutation and recombination with some other strains which resulted in pandemic outbreak between 2014 and 2015. We identified the sequence insertion which is unique only in Thailand strains (TH-S-INS) and was mainly detected in TH1 subgroup particularly the samples in the outbreaks between 2014 and 2015. This insertion was also detected in 2 samples of TH2 subgroup which was sampled in 2014 and no sample that belong to subgroup TH2 was detected in 2015. These suggested that the strains in TH1 might underwent positive selection pressure somehow and some of them experienced an insertion mutation event as described in the result. The first sample which containing this insertion of TH2 was P1414-SPF-071403A, and, was collected in July 2014 whereas another 27 samples from 8 outbreaks which collected at the same month are TH1. P1314-VCF-071401A is the represent sequence of the samples that containing this insertion of TH1 at 99% identity.",

TH1 subgroup showed distinctly higher evolutionary rate than other analyzed groups.

In comparison between TH1 and the TH2 groups, TH1 is more in population parted in the events whereas TH2 is more in number of recombination evidences. These results may explain that TH1 recombinants were chosen to be the subgroup that suitable to cause an outbreaks whereas TH2 is keep undergoing recombination but not usually cause an outbreaks. TH2 might be the predominant group which could adapt to survive and persist in the host without triggering symptom development, therefore some were not included in the study. On the other hand, TH2 might not be preferred for proliferation in the host. However, we did not perform active surveillance to take the samples from subclinical herds so we could not make a final conclusion. For TH3, we did further analysis with the dataset that using in phylogenetic analysis, and, there is possible that PXX11-SBF-021102A is the recombinant of NPPED2008 (KC764952) and Chinju99 (AV167585) of G2 and G1 genogroup as major and minor parents, respectively. This information supported why TH3 subgroup is locate between genogroup 1 and 2 (Fig. 1), and, very close and share the same estimated divergence to TH5 subgroup (Fig. 3). The results of geographic distribution show that the western part of Thailand (mainly in Ratchaburi) is the endemic area of most strains, however, TH2 seem to be limited in these area whereas TH1 is spreading from west-central-east of Thailand. Another new introductions (TH3\u20136) were denoted by the pinpoint since they could not performed analysis. These results together with previous described suggested that TH1 is becoming the predominant subgroup which endemic in Thailand since 2014.",
