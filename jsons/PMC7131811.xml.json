            "text": "In recent years, the duty to care of health care providers (HCPs) during communicable disease outbreaks has resurfaced as an important and contentious topic. The re-emergence of communicable diseases, which were largely thought to have become extinct (at least in North America) and therefore irrelevant to the modern day practitioner (Arras, 1988; Clark, 2005; Huber & Wynia, 2004; Lederberg, 1996; Morse, 2004; Patlak, 1996) has lead to renewed discourse on duty to care. In particular, the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) presented circumstances that were propitious for reconsidering this issue, namely the reluctance of some HCPs to care for patients suspected of infection by this unknown pathogen. While some simply refused to work, others seriously questioned the nature of their duty in light of unknown and unquantifiable risk to themselves and their families.",

In turn, SARS fundamentally changed our assumptions about duty and risk\u2014assumptions that had informed the debate on the duty to care in the early years of HIV/AIDS (Reid, 2005). Ruderman and colleagues called for an honest and critical examination of the role of HCPs during outbreaks in order to provide guidelines regarding professional rights and responsibilities as well as ethical duties and obligations (Ruderman et al., 2006). A social dialogue to advance the public debate on this increasingly urgent issue was needed.",

The analysis was organized into three phases: open, axial, and selective coding (Yin, 1994). In open coding, transcripts were read multiple times and then fractured by identifying units of text relating to a concept or idea. In axial coding, ideas were compared for consistency both within and between transcripts with the intention of organizing similar ideas into overarching themes or conceptual categories which are then further developed by iteration in order to eliminate redundancy and ensure that categories are comprehensive. In selective coding, core concepts were identified as central themes of the study and conceptual categories were organized in relation to these concepts.",

However, the breadth of grounds upon which such claims have been made is not as wide as the diversity of claims would suggest. In general, all of these arguments treat the question of the duty to care within a single paradigm usually defined within the confines of an individualized duty to care\u2014and thus neglect contextual and extrinsic considerations relevant to and necessary for satisfying this duty, especially during outbreaks. While most scholars who have explored the nature of the duty to care offer compelling arguments to justify the ethical duty to care, many of them ground it in an \u201cirreducibly individual obligation\u201d (Tomlinson, 2004). This might be explained by the fact that the deontological nature of the notion of duty naturally leads to an exploration of the duty to care in such deontological, i.e. inherently individualist, terms. It can also be explained by the fact that discussions on the duty to care have been explored in the context of a biomedical framework focusing on the patient\u2014physician relationship.",

As our study illustrates, the broader institutional and societal context must be taken into account. It thus follows based on our findings that the limits to the duty to care cannot be left simply to personal choice or an appeal to morality that emerges from an individualized notion of caring. Moreover, the relevance of these considerations does not lie in the distinction between the micro-, meso-, and macro-levels of analysis but in the interplay and the linkages between them; HCPs cannot adequately fulfill their duty to care without institutional and societal support. The nature of the duty to care ought to be weaved within the fabric of society in order to provide HCPs with the conditions and resources necessary to satisfy their duty, rather than based on an ethic derived entirely from individual obligations.",

As well, we conducted our research against the backdrop of the threat of a pandemic influenza; this prospect, and the wide media coverage it has received, informed participants\u2019 views. Moreover, many participants drew on their past experiences during outbreaks of polio, tuberculosis, and malaria. As such, we believe that the findings of our research are directly applicable to the current debate on pandemic influenza preparedness and other newly emerging communicable diseases, such as extreme drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-TB), a newly identified TB threat which leaves patients (including many people living with HIV) virtually untreatable using currently available anti-TB drugs.",

We sought to describe lay and expert views and perspectives on the duty to care of HCPs during outbreaks. Our analysis can inform the development of an empirically based conceptual framework to guide both the articulation of acceptable norms of duty to care during outbreaks and the development of public policy regarding the management of future outbreaks. Our findings raise a host of issues that remain unresolved; it will be important to address these in the context of emerging outbreaks such as pandemic influenza and XDR-TB.",
