Like other RNA viruses, influenza viruses replicate with extremely low fidelity, with a mutation rate of roughly 2 x 10\u22125 substitutions per nucleotide copied per cellular infection [5\u20137]. Influenza viruses also undergo reassortment of their genomic segments, a combinatorial exchange of genetic material analogous to recombination in other RNA viruses [8,9]. Together, low replicative fidelity and frequent reassortment allow influenza virus populations to generate significant diversity. This capacity may allow influenza viruses to maintain, or to quickly generate, the requisite mutations that mediate cross species transmission, escape from neutralizing antibody, or drug resistance [10].",

Here, we define viral fitness as the capacity of an individual, or population, to generate infectious progeny. Most mutations have deleterious effects on fitness, which suggests that mutational tolerance may play a significant role in determining the genetic diversity that can be maintained within a population [13]. Mutational robustness refers to phenotypic stability in the face of mutation [14\u201316]. High mutation rates select for increased mutational robustness [17], and a more robust population can increase its genetic diversity without a dramatic alteration in mean fitness. A virus\u2019 intrinsic robustness may influence its fitness in vitro and virulence in vivo [18].",

An alternative approach commonly used in RNA viruses is to accelerate mutation accumulation by passaging virus in the presence of mutagenic drugs [30\u201332]. While both methods provide valuable information about the average fitness impact of random mutation, uncertainty about the number of mutations per clone and the fitness effect of each individual mutation makes it difficult to accurately model a distribution. These issues also complicate more recent, high throughput methods based on next generation sequencing [33\u201335]. Furthermore, none of these approaches provide accurate estimates of the fraction of mutations that are lethal to the virus.",

The first such study, of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), found that over 90% of random single nucleotide mutations reduce replicative fitness and 40% are lethal in this negative sense RNA virus [13]. Subsequent work by Sanjuan, Elena, and colleagues found somewhat similar distributions of MFE in f1 (ssDNA phage), phiX 174 (ssDNA phage), QB (+ssRNA phage), and tobacco etch virus (+ssRNA virus) [19,36\u201340].

Here we characterize the distribution of MFE in influenza A virus, a segmented negative sense RNA virus whose evolutionary dynamics are important to global health. We used site directed mutagenesis to generate a library of plasmids encoding 128 influenza A viruses, each with a single point mutation in the A/WSN33/H1N1 genetic background. The large number of mutants allowed us to define the MFE across the genome and to compare the lethal fraction and MFE between segments coding for the surface proteins to those coding for the internal proteins. We find that the MFE of influenza A are remarkably similar to those of other viruses with varying genome structure. While similar proportions of mutations in the surface proteins and internal proteins were lethal, the average impact of mutation appeared to be less deleterious in HA and NA. Our results suggest that the size and compactness of a virus\u2019 genome, and not necessarily the genomic nucleic acid or mode of replication, are major determinants of its intrinsic mutational robustness.",

Accurate assessment of this lethal fraction is an essential, and non-trivial, task. In a reverse genetic approach, the efficiency of transfection and viral recovery are key parameters, since a failed transfection and a lethal mutation will both give supernatants with undetectable titers. We used two approaches to address this problem. In the first, we estimated the transfection failure rate and calculated the probability of miscalling a viable mutant as lethal. Over the course of this study, we transfected the WT virus 19 individual times, and never failed to recover virus in our P0 supernatants. As in [13], we quantified the expected probability of a transfection failure as if we had observed a single WT transfection failure. This conservative approach gave a per transfection failure rate of < 5.26%. Because we attempted three independent transfections for each candidate lethal, the likelihood of repeated transfection failure is 0.05263, or 1.46 x10-4. In a set of 128 viruses, we would expect to falsely identify fewer than one (128 * 1.46 x 10\u22124 = 0.019) virus as lethal. This probabilistic model assumes equal transfection efficiency for WT and mutant viruses. We also tested one of our mutants, PB2_14 (PB2 C532A), which had moderately reduced fitness (0.81, see below). Here too, we successfully recovered virus in 19 individual transfections.",

We therefore considered a mutation to be lethal if we had undetectable virus in three independent transfections or if we were unable to recover the mutation in a P1 stock after blind passage of the P0 stock. Using these criteria, there were 30 lethal mutations (31.6%) in the genome-wide dataset and 38 lethal mutations in the combined dataset (29.7%, Table 1). The lethal fraction did not differ appreciably between either the HA/NA encoding segments and the rest of the genome (16/57 vs. 22/71; Fisher exact test, p = 0.85) or the HA encoding segment and the rest of the genome (7/32 vs. 31/96; Fisher exact test, p = 0.37). We had 62% to detect a two fold difference in the lethal fraction for HA/NA and 52% power to detect a two fold difference in the lethal fraction for HA. No synonymous mutations were lethal, but 2 non-coding mutations and a stop codon loss were lethal.",

Given the error prone replication of RNA viruses, we considered it possible that second-site mutations might accumulate in the short time between transfection and completion of the first passage. This might be exaggerated in the less fit viruses, since there would be strong positive selection of a compensatory mutation. If a compensatory mutation swept through the population, it would confound assignment of a fitness value to the initial mutation. Therefore, we sequenced the entire genome of the P1 stocks for 78 of our mutants on the Illumina platform to identify any second site mutations and their frequency. In all but 3 cases, the desired mutation was present at >94%, and was present at >99% in nearly all. Very few additional mutations were identified at >2% (Table 2, S2 Table). We relied on Sanger sequencing alone to confirm the desired mutation in replicate stocks of the remaining 13 viable viruses. We conclude that these stocks are essentially clonal and that the fitness of these populations will reflect the impact of each individual mutation.",

Given the relative imprecision of one step growth curves for quantification of growth parameters in influenza and many other viruses, we measured the relative fitness of each mutant in direct competition with the WT over serial passage [18]. In this assay, the mutant is competed with a tagged WT reference, which has a cluster of synonymous mutations in the PB1 open reading frame. These mutations allowed us to distinguish the barcoded WT from a non-barcoded mutant in a mixed infection using quantitative reverse transcription PCR with primers specific for their respective sequences. Importantly, this tagged WT virus competed equally well with the untagged WT virus over 6 passages, demonstrating the selective neutrality of the marker (Fig 1A). In our serial passage competition assay, the change in relative frequency of the WT and mutant over time is the difference in growth rate, or the selection rate constant (Fig 1B). The exponent of this value is the relative fitness. We have shown previously that this assay can provide precise measurements of relative fitness with as few as 3 technical replicates [18], although it is less sensitive for weakly deleterious or beneficial mutations with a relative fitness close to 1.",

We modeled our empiric data on the deleterious mutations against exponential, gamma, beta, Weibull, and lognormal predictions and determined the best fit based on their Akaike information criteria (AIC, Table 4). For each dataset, the beta model was the best at capturing the distribution of fitness effects. We also fit distributions from a large, recently published dataset of poliovirus mutants [48]. Here, the beta model also provided the best fit. These beta models are described by two shape parameters, \u03b1 and \u03b2, in which the expected value of the beta distribution is \u03b1/(\u03b1+\u03b2). The \u03b1 and \u03b2 parameters for each of the random, surface, and internal influenza MFE datasets as well as the poliovirus MFE dataset are similar (Table 4). Some have suggested that deleterious mutational fitness effects may be better explained by more complex models [49]. We therefore attempted to combine the above distributions with uniform distributions, in which we allowed the latter to describe a proportion of our mutants\u2019 fitness effects. However, in the cases tested, adding this uniform distribution did not improve the fit of our models. While the influenza A and poliovirus mutational fitness effects were both best described by a beta distribution, there was no similar consensus among previously characterized viruses [19]. VSV was best described by a lognormal + uniform distribution, TEV by a beta distribution, phiX174 by an exponential distribution, QB by a gamma distribution, and F1 by a log normal distribution. In most of these fits, the AIC of the beta distribution did not differ appreciably from the AIC of the best-fit probability density function.",

Recent work suggests that epistasis is quite prevalent across the influenza virus genome, and we therefore considered it likely that the same mutations would have distinct fitness effects in other genetic backgrounds [50\u201353]. To understand the degree to which our fitness measurements for specific WSN33 mutations are generalizable, we compared our data to those obtained for analogous mutants in WSN33 and other genetic backgrounds. Bloom and colleagues have used deep mutational scanning (DMS) to broadly sample most of the possible amino acid substitutions in the HA and nucleoprotein open reading frames [35,46,54,55]. Deep sequencing of mutant libraries before and after passage was used to infer site preferences for every amino acid at every site and to calculate site entropy, or inherent tolerance of substitution at a given site. Site entropy will tend to capture the general mutability of a position, while site preference is likely to be more specific for a mutation in a given genetic background. Importantly for our comparison, many of the plasmids had multiple mutations and the site preferences represent the average effect of a mutation in the background of very similar, but distinct, sequences.",

In PR8, a closely related lab strain, we found a stronger correlation between fitness and site entropy (Fig 5B, Spearman r = 0.79, p = 0.0037). The correlation between WSN33 fitness and PR8 site preference was weaker (Spearman r = 0.60) but did achieve statistical significance (p = 0.0450). Interestingly, our WSN33 fitness values were correlated with site entropy in the more distantly related Aichi H3N2 strain (Fig 5C, Spearman r = 0.59, p = 0.0465). The correlation with site preference was weaker for the WSN33-Aichi comparison than the WSN33-PR8 comparison (Spearman r = 0.26) and did not achieve significance (p = 0.4031). Together, our fitness values are reasonably correlated with site entropy in distinct strains and subtypes, and these data suggest that a sizeable portion of mutational fitness effects are attributable to the general mutational tolerance at a given site. The observation that fitness was correlated with site preference for HA in WSN33 and NP in PR8 (H1N1), but not in Aichi (H3N2) suggests that the fitness impact of these mutations will vary with genetic background due to intragenic or intergenic epistasis. We are cautious in this interpretation given the differences in the underlying experimental design, sample size, and nature of the datasets, as outlined above. Given that Doud and Bloom found general conservation in site preference between PR8 and A/Aichi/1968, it is possible that our differences could be due to the type and number of amino acid substitutions in our smaller NP dataset.",

Indeed, we found only two mutations, both in HA, that were present at reasonably high frequencies in more recent, circulating strains (S4 Table, S2 Fig). One was weakly deleterious, Q381L (fitness 0.93 \u00b1 0.06, present in 78.7%) and the other was beneficial, HA M420I (fitness 1.12 \u00b1 0.07, present at 79.7%).

The prevalence of only two other non-synonymous mutations was above 0.1%, HA N101I (fitness 0.97 \u00b1 0.06, present in 0.247%) and NA D135N (lethal, present in 0.173%).

This set of viruses includes viruses with both DNA and RNA genomes (among which the authors found similar distribution patterns), and influenza is the first segmented virus to be described by this method. We compared the lethal fraction, mean, and variance of our mutational fitness effects to these previously characterized viruses. Because relative fitness values in VSV, QB, phiX174, and F1 were measured as differences in exponential growth rate, we first transformed our serial passage fitness values based on the wild type exponential growth rate in our experimental conditions (S5 Table). A similar transformation has been described for TEV to allow comparison of exponential growth rates across systems (see Methods and [19]). Overall, we found that the lethal fraction and our scaled fitness values closely matched those for these other small DNA and RNA viruses. We also calculated the skewness and kurtosis for each data set to quantitatively describe the shape of the distribution (Table 5). Following the general property that mutations are more likely to be deleterious than beneficial, we found negative values for skewness in each of our data sets. Kurtosis, measuring the \u201cpeakness\u201d of a distribution, was above 5 for each of our data sets. A positive kurtosis value indicates that a probability density function has a heavier tail and more values near the mean than predicted by a Gaussian distribution.",

We ensured the relative clonality of nearly all of our stocks by next generation sequencing and used a highly quantitative assay for fitness measurements. Both the lethal fraction and the overall distribution of MFE of influenza A are quite similar to what has been found for ssDNA and other RNA viruses. Consistent with what has been assumed, but to our knowledge never shown, the surface proteins of influenza virus appear to be slightly more tolerant of point mutation than the internal viral proteins. This finding did not achieve statistical significance.

            "text": "The MFE of many viruses were initially explored by mutation accumulation (MA) experiments involving serial plaque to plaque transfers [25\u201329]. While these studies suggested that many mutations were deleterious, MA experiments are generally unable to assign fitness values to individual mutations. Similarly, mutagen sensitivity has been used to define the global impact of mutation and the relative robustness of viral strains or even multiple viral species [23,30,31,57,58]. Neither gives a reliable estimate of the lethal fraction and comparisons across viral families can be confounded by differences in host cells, basal viral mutation rates, and the pleiotropic effects of commonly used mutagens on cellular metabolism. More recently, several groups have used higher throughput assays to measure viral mutational tolerance [33,35,48]. While these approaches allow for impressively large datasets, they are similarly imprecise in assigning fitness values to individual mutations. Because lethal and strongly deleterious mutations will be present at extremely low frequency, they are easily lost from populations with serial passage and variably ascertained by even the best deep sequencing approaches. For example, the impressive characterization of poliovirus MFE by CirSeq could only quantify the average fitness of a mutation across a range of haplotypes, given that each mutation can potentially arise in the setting of a genome that already bears a different mutation [48]. Many mutations were also present at very low frequency, varied significantly across passages, and were presumably subject to clonal interference. Measurement of fitness effects from these data also required extensive modeling of genetic drift. In influenza A virus, two different groups have used random mutagenesis of plasmids and next generation sequencing of recovered viruses to infer the mutational robustness of hemagglutinin [33,35] and nucleoprotein [54,55]. Because many of the plasmids had multiple mutations and the sequencing assays were unable to accurately measure fitness, these important works were nevertheless unable to model the distribution of MFE. The only genome-wide study of influenza A MFE, of which we are aware, utilized transposon-based insertional mutagenesis, and is less informative about the impact of single nucleotide mutation [59].",

Sanjuan, Moya, and Elena pioneered the use of small libraries of viruses with single nucleotide substitutions to model the MFE of vesicular stomatitis virus [13]. Since this initial study, Sanjuan has used a similar approach to define the MFE of the phages QB, f1, and phiX174 [36,37], and Elena has applied it to tobacco etch virus [40]. The advantage of this approach is that it links specific mutations to fitness values, provides precise fitness measurements, and accurately estimates the lethal fraction. We improved on this method by generating a larger genome-wide library of mutants and by also including sub-libraries to compare the impact of mutations on different viral proteins. Our exhaustive characterization of the lethal fraction by repeated transfection, documentation of the relative clonality of each stock by deep sequencing, and use of a highly quantitative competition assay also ensure the quality of our model of influenza A MFE. An obvious drawback of this approach is that it was only feasible to analyze 128 single nucleotide mutations. While we took great pains to ensure random selection of our mutations, it is possible that our random sample of mutations is biased in some way from the overall set of roughly 39,000 possible SNV in influenza A viruses. We are encouraged that our distribution is similar to what has been found in both high and low throughput studies [19,48].",

For example, in cell culture they can vary with host cell type, temperature, and multiplicity of infection. We chose to use A549 cells, as they are derived from a respiratory epithelium and support relatively efficient replication of influenza virus. The variability and inefficiency of primary cells present difficulties for a large-scale comparative study such as ours. We chose a relatively low multiplicity to reduce bias in fitness measurements due to complementation and reassortment in multiply infected cells. We note, however, that our relatively low transfer populations in the serial passage experiment could contribute to the observed variability in replicate fitness measurements through genetic drift [43]. While our cell-based assay will capture elements of fitness related to virus interactions with the host cell machinery and evasion of the innate immune response, it does not model the impact of adaptive immunity. While we would argue that many of the deleterious mutations are likely to be so in many environments, some mutations that are only weakly deleterious in cell culture may be subject to stronger purifying selection in nature. Finally, our mutations in WSN33 may not have the same fitness impact in H3N2, or other subtypes, due to intragenic and intergenic epistasis. The observed correlation between site entropy and fitness on a set of a HA and NP mutants suggests that the overall distribution of MFE will be conserved.",

            "text": "Across viral systems, increased genetic variability is often observed in surface or structural proteins relative to internally located, non-structural proteins. This bias could be attributable to local differences in mutation rate or mutational robustness and may have implications for evasion of host antibody [61]. It is therefore interesting that the fitness impact of mutations in the segments coding for hemagglutinin and neuraminidase appear to be slightly less than those in proteins encoded by the other six genomic segments. Host-specific evolutionary rates are also higher for HA and NA relative to the other 6 segments [62]. The 6 internal segments have similar rates, and we were underpowered to distinguish differences in robustness among them. Our finding of a trend toward increased mutational tolerance in the HA protein, and the head in particular, is consistent with the tolerance of HA to transposon insertion [59] and deep mutational scanning experiments [35]. These data suggest that HA is more robust to mutation, possibly as a consequence of this history of strong and repeated selection for antigenic escape. A byproduct of this robustness could be the greater exploration of antigenic sequence space and subsequent immune escape [63]. Here, mutational robustness would increase evolvability, or the capacity for adaptive evolution. This concept is attractive in view of the proposed epochal evolution of influenza A H3N2 on neutral networks [64]. We note that our study was of an H1N1 virus, and there may be important differences in the mutational robustness of H3N2 and H1N1 surface proteins. This is especially important given their different evolutionary rates [65]. As we and others have pointed out, the relationship between mutational robustness and evolvability is complex, and there are clearly situations in which increased robustness will either increase or decrease evolvability [16,66\u201368].",

Because we relied on an assumption of exponential growth over the course of the competition assay to transform our fitness values into exponential growth rates (see Methods), it is possible that we have either over- or underestimated the similarities. Given that this collection includes a negative sense ssRNA virus (VSV), a segmented negative sense RNA virus (influenza A), three positive sense ssRNA viruses, and two ssDNA viruses, it is clear that the type and polarity of the genomic nucleic acid are not major determinants of robustness. Their similarity likely reflects shared constraints due to small and compact genomes [19]. Small genome viruses often have overlapping reading frames or regulatory elements that are more sensitive to genetic disruption. Larger genomes allow for more genetic redundancy and modularity, which could limit the impact of point mutations. Interestingly, the hypersensitivity of these viruses to mutation at an individual level may actually promote robustness at a population level [69]. In large populations under strong purifying selection, deleterious variants are rapidly purged and the wild type sequence preserved. We note that recombination and reassortment in RNA viruses are often considered to be adaptive as they could also increase robustness by purging deleterious mutations from populations [70\u201372]. Given the association between sex and mutation fitness effects in evolutionary theory, it is interesting that we find similar robustness of an asexual virus (VSV), a recombining virus (poliovirus) and a reassorting virus (influenza). While our assay conditions minimized reassortment, a long-term life history of reassortment does not appear to have altered the intrinsic mutational fitness effects of influenza virus.",

The DeepSNV algorithm relies on a clonal control to estimate the local error rate within a given sequence context and to identify strand bias in base calling. It then applies a hierarchical binomial model based on mutation calls for test and control at each base and position to identify true-positive SNV. The clonal control was a library prepared in an identical fashion from 8 plasmids containing the A/WSN33/H1N1 genome and sequenced in the same flow cell. Code for our implementation of DeepSNV can be found at https://github.com/lauringlab/variant_pipeline, and can be accessed anonymously. True positive SNV were identified from the raw output tables (S2 Table) by applying the following filtering criteria in R: (i) Bonferonni corrected p value < 0.01, (ii) average MapQ score on variant reads > 30, (iii) average phred score on variant positions > 35, (iv) average position of variant call on a read > 50 and < 200, (v) variant frequency > 0.02. Application of these criteria to a viral spike-in dataset with equivalent genome copy number inputs resulted in > 95% sensitivity and > 99.99% specificity for SNV present at > 1% of the population [79].",

Cells were infected at a total MOI of 0.01 with an equal TCID50 of WT and a given mutant. Three replicate wells were infected with each pair of viruses. Passage 1 virus was harvested after 48 hours and one replicate was titered by TCID50. This titer was used to calculate the dilution factor necessary to maintain an MOI of 0.01 for subsequent passages. Four passages were performed for each competition. RNA was harvested from each passage using PureLink 96 well RNA mini kits (Invitrogen). Random hexamers were used to prime cDNA synthesis with 1/10 of the RNA. Each cDNA was analyzed by real time PCR using three different primer sets with duplicate PCR reactions for each sample/primer set. The first set, PB1_149f 5\u2019 CAGAAAGGGGAAGATGGACA 3\u2019 and PB1_360r 5\u2019 GTCCACTCGTGTTTGCTGAA 3\u2019, were used to quantify total viral genomic RNA. The second set, pPol1PB1_555f 5\u2019 TCAGAGAAAGAGACGAGTGAG 3\u2019 and pPol1PB1_555r 5\u2019 AAACCCCCTTATTTGCATCC 3\u2019, were used to quantify the amount of mutant viral RNA. The third set, pPol1PB1_555fm 5\u2019 ATTTCCAACGGAAACGGAGGG 3\u2019 and pPol1PB1_555r 5\u2019 AAACCCCCTTATTTGCATCC3\u2019, were used to quantify the amount of barcoded WT viral RNA. We verified that the levels of RNA (Cycle threshold, Ct) were well correlated with the infectious titer (TCID50/ml) for the mutants shown in Fig 1B. Duplicate wells were averaged and values were excluded from subsequent analysis if duplicates wells differed by > 0.5 Ct or any of the Ct were out of the empirically determined linear range for that primer pair. Relative amounts of WT and mutant RNA were determined by normalizing the cycle thresholds for each to those of the common (PB1_149f and PB1_360r) primer set (DCt = CtVirus-CtPB1 total). The normalized values for each virus passages 1\u20134 were then compared to passage 0 to obtain a ratio relative to P1 (\u0394\u0394Ct = CtPX-CtP0). This relative Ct value was converted to reflect the fold change (\u0394ratio = 2-log\u0394\u0394Ct). The change in ratio of the mutant relative to the change in ratio of the WT as a function of passage is the fitness ([\u0394ratioMut-\u0394ratioWT]/time).",

Here, the relative fitness values for VSV, QB, phiX174, and F1 were calculated as differences in the exponential growth rate. The data on TEV were originally derived by qPCR as in the present study. In this comparative analysis, Sanjuan applied a correction to the TEV data to enable direct comparisons of growth rate. We applied this same correction to our data to transform the values to something resembling an exponential growth rate. The exponential growth rate, r, of influenza A on A549 in a 12 well dish at moi 0.01, is derived from the equation: Nt = N0ert, where t = 2 days (48 hour passage), N0 is 10,000 infectious units (the amount at time 0), and Nt is the titer after time t, or 48 hours. For Nt, we used the mean of three replicates for HA-40 (9.3e5), which has a fitness of 1 (see Fig 1B). This is similar to the scaled output of WSN33 that we have observed at different moi and different well sizes. Solving for r gives a value of 2.26 per day. We then applied the following correction from [19], y = (lnx + r)/r, where y is the relative exponential growth rate of a given mutant, x is the relative fitness measured by qPCR and reported in Tables 1 and 3, and r is the estimate of the WT exponential growth rate under our experimental conditions (2.26 per day). For example, a fitness of 0.8 in our assay is transformed to a relative exponential growth rate of 0.90. The relative exponential growth rates, as calculated, are reported in S5 Table. We note that using a value 2e6 for Nt (which would be roughly consistent with the average dilution factor applied at each passage in many of the competition experiments, gives a growth rate of 2.65 per day and relative exponential growth rate of 0.916 for a virus with a fitness of 0.8.",
