In collaboration with the Pennsylvania HIV Planning Group (HPG) we developed an intersectional stigma measure to examine experiences of stigma and discrimination in healthcare settings among individuals living with HIV (PLWH). This survey is ongoing and aims to assess the prevalence of multidimensional stigma in healthcare settings, characterize intersectional stigma burden, and evaluate the impact of stigma on health among a sample of individuals living with HIV in Pennsylvania who are recipients of the AIDS Drug Assistance Program. In this Note from the Field, we describe the unprompted COVID-related responses we have received since March 4, 2020 until the writing of this Note (April 14, 2020). These responses present an important opportunity to begin to learn about how the COVID-19 pandemic is affecting the lives of people living with HIV and their beliefs and attitudes about their healthcare needs and experiences.",

Between March 4 and April 14, 2020, we received 19 COVID-19 related responses to the opentext questions from 16 participants (Table 1) . Of the 16 participants, 94% identified as male; 94% identified as White; and 75% identified as gay. The age of participants ranged from 29 to 72, with a mean age of 58.7. Participants represented four Ryan White regional grantee regions of the seven regions in the Commonwealth. This is a subsample of a larger, more diverse sample of respondents.",

The COVID-19 related responses that we have received to date indicate the great concern that PLWH feel about potential dual diagnoses with COVID-19 and increased susceptibility to poor COVID outcomes as a result of HIV positive status. These unprompted responses covered several domains of concern including avoidance of healthcare services due to nosocomial risk of COVID infection, social isolation, change in routine, potential mortality, continued access to healthcare services, and management of comorbidities, specifically cancer. In addition, the utilization of telemedicine for healthcare and trust in practitioner's advice during the COVID-19 pandemic emerged as positive domains.",

PLWH are navigating their HIV and related healthcare needs in the era of the COVID-19 pandemic, in addition to navigating COVID-19 prevention and care while living with HIV. Living with a stigmatized chronic infectious disease in the times of a pandemic presents a myriad of challenges. This is particularly true in communities of color and SGM communities who experience systemic social and health inequities [5, 6] . Gross disparities in our society around race, sexual, gender identities, employment, health, and education lead many populations to experience discrimination, unwelcome attitudes, and lack of understanding from healthcare staff [4] . COVID-19 is exacerbating these inequities in terms of housing stability, employment status, healthcare access, and food security. This is further demonstrated in a recent analysis published by the CDC that shows African American are disproportionately in need of COVID-related hospital care [6] .",

As PLWH self-isolate to prevent COVID-19, we need to recognize that enforced social isolation in populations who already report stigma, alienation and discrimination may exacerbate underlying psychosocial health conditions. Studies have shown that people living with HIV are already more likely to experience loneliness due to a history of stigma and discrimination, with studies also indicating that higher levels of loneliness and social isolation result in greater negative health outcomes, including a higher likelihood of smoking, at-risk drinking or substance use, higher rates or depression, and lower quality of life [7] . We need work to understand the effects of social isolation on individuals living with HIV, how they are seeking support and how they want to be supported. It is now even more important to work on short-term interventions to increase social connectedness during these times of isolation.",

Coronavirus Prostate cancer, corona virus (COVID-19) The coronavirus I am hoping I don't need service soon with the virus thing going around and being with a compromised immune system Everything being complicated with fear and anxiety associated with having my condition during the Coronavirus period, safely arriving and exiting to my appointment in order to have to repeat a biopsy is what I'm worried about This survey is being answered during the height of the corona virus restrictions Multiple skin cancer sites, coronavirus coronavirus Covid-19 and cancer returning The Crona 19 virus What are you most looking forward to in your next healthcare-related experience? Ninety Nine percent of My health-care experiences are great so I'm not expect anything more than that\u2026 I changed HIV doctors and due to the coronavirus I had an appointment over the phone\u2026 it was good My next appointment (hopefully) is my PCP/Infectious disease physician. He is fantastic as my doctor and very close as a friend. He is also recognized for his intelligence broadcasting on coronavirus Telemedicine visit possibly replace my appointment What are some concerns you may have about your future healthcare needs and options? CORONAVIRUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I'm terrified that my needs and options will become harder to have due to the long lasting time that I'm hearing that the Coronavirus will be lasting, i.e., resources will be fewer and more difficult to find. Also, I am on salvage therapy and my options to treatments are fewer and my hearing bad news becomes more. I feel like a deer facing headlights Getting by this coronavirus period of virtual isolation. Normally, I go the gym twice daily and eat out an awful lot. I, like all, am concerned about how long this situation will continue Honestly? In plain English, I am scared shitless of the coronavirus Now? Having HIV and coronavirus. Scary\u2026 that virus going around",
