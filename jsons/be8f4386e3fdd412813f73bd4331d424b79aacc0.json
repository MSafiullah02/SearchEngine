Many studies have reported a growing burden of a wide range of mental disorders including sleep disorders (Rajkumar, 2020; Zhang et al., 2020) . Psychosocial stressors like anxiety, stress, changed lifestyle with limited social support, and fear may affect the pattern of sleep among individual often leading to sleep disorders (Krystal, 2012; Staner, 2003) . As there is a growing concern on mental health problems during COVID-19 (Hossain et al., 2020b; Rajkumar, 2020) , research synthesis may play a critical role in understanding the burden of those problems and addressing the same. To the best of our knowledge, there is a scarcity of evidence on the magnitude of sleep disorders among individuals affected by this pandemic. This scoping review aims to address this knowledge gap through systematically evaluating the current evidence on the epidemiological burden of sleep disorders, associated factors, and interventions addressing the same. .
