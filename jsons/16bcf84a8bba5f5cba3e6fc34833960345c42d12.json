The strategy in virtual screening of antiviral databases for possible therapeutic effect would be to identify promising drug molecules, as there is currently no vaccine or treatment approved against COVID-19. Targeting the main protease (pdb id: 6LU7) is gaining importance in anti-CoV drug design. In this conceptual context, an attempt has been made to suggest an in silico computational relationship between US-FDA approved drugs, plant-derived natural drugs, and Coronavirus main protease (6LU7) protein. The evaluation of results was made based on Glide (Schr\u00f6dinger) dock score. Out of 62 screened compounds, the best docking scores with the targets were found for compounds: lopinavir, amodiaquine, and theaflavin digallate (TFDG). Molecular dynamic (MD) simulation study was also performed for 20 ns to confirm the stability behaviour of the main protease and inhibitor complexes. The MD simulation study validated the stability of three compounds in the protein binding pocket as potent binders. Infection: Insight from Molecular Docking Study.

The complexes bound to the protein receptor molecule were removed. The protein preparation wizard from the Schr\u00f6dinger module was used to prepare the structure of the main protease on adding the hydrogen atoms, removing the waters beyond 5\u00c5 of the binding site, and the active site grid was generated using the Receptor grid generation application in Glide module. Glide uses a filter search to locate the ligand in the active-site region of the receptor. The shape and properties of the receptor are represented on a grid that provides a more accurate scoring of the ligand poses. The grid of 20\u00c5 was generated over the co-crystallized ligand inhibitor molecule.

Periodic boundary conditions were used. Energy minimization was done with a tolerance of 1000kJ/mol/nm. Equilibration of the system was done using NVT and NPT ensemble for 100 ps. The trajectories were set to be generated every 2 fs and save every 2ps. The protein-ligand complexes results were then analyzed.

Lopinavir showed interactions of hydrogen bond interactions with Glu 166, GLN 189, GLY 143 and pi -pi stacking with His 41 (Fig. 2a and b) and was successfully docked with a best docking score of -9.918 , glide energy -8.023, and glide e-model -76.898 (Table 1) Glu 166, whereas pi-pi stacking with His 41 (Fig.4a and b) of the active site residues of main protease and the docked complex orientation exhibited a docking score of -7.421, glide gscore of -8.023, and glide e-model -76.898 (Table 3 ). The LIGPLOT 2D interaction showed the interacting residue information. The results produced from docking showed the antimalarial drug and Theaflavin digallate.

The structure variation was calculated by RMSD values of protein-ligand complexes from 0 to 20 ns. The RMSD values steadily increased from 0 to 5 ns, and reached stable state throughout the simulation. The average RMSD values of amodiquine, lopinavir, and theaflavin digallate were found to be 0.25, 0.23, and 0.22 nm, respectively. RMSF provides the fluctuation of each atom in the overall simulation (Fig.5a-7a) . RMSF was calculated for protease with 306 amino acids and three potential drug candidates; the values confirmed that the binding site residues showed less fluctuation. The average RMSF values were 0.15, 0.17, and 0.2 nm for amodiquine, lopinavir, and theaflavin digallate, respectively ( Fig.5b-7b) . The radius of gyration (Rg) of the protein and ligand complexes was found to be between 2.13 and 2.18 nm initially. The Rg values of the main protease with amaodiquine was stabilized after 5 ns and in case of lopinavir and theaflavin digallate, the values were decreased initially and stabilized from 5 to 20 ns which was an indicator for a stable binding pose (Fig.5c-7c) and reported that the ligand-binding site of the SARS-CoV 3CL pro (main protease) was around active sites of H41 and C145 [11] .

Identification of natural and existing approved drugs is a noteworthy step for early drug discovery against COVID-19. Based on the observations of docking score, we believed that the phenol derivative and anti-HIV drug, could aid in COVID-19 drug discovery. The RMSD of three complexes fall between 0.15 and 0.25 nm and inferred that the compounds lopinavir, amodiquine, and theaflavin digallate had undergone good conformational changes while binding, and maintained close affinity with the binding site of the main protease. However, in vitro and in vivo evaluation study is required to repurpose these three drugs against 2019-nCoV. ",

The HTVS mode identified active compounds for screening, and ligands with different conformations were screened and false positives eliminated. The LigPrep program produced results for 1,129 ligand conformations of FDA approved antiviral drugs, 459 of anti-malarial drugs, and 110 of plantbased drugs. The stereo conformer per each ligand which showed the lowest energy with the receptor has been selected for further docking study under SP (Standard Precision) mode of Glide. The Protein-ligand interaction of the stable docked Lopinavir, Amodiaquine, and Theaflavin digallate with main protease complex was visualized with ligand interaction.",
