For example, cyclins D and E are crucial in the G1 phase, cyclin A is required in the S phase, and both cyclin B and cyclin A are important in the G2 and mitotic phases (Obaya and Sedivy, 2002). Cyclin D1-Cdk4/6 complexes regulate G1-phase progression by phosphorylation of the downstream retinoblastoma (Rb) protein (Blomen and Boonstra, 2007, Shafer, 1998). Later in the G1 phase, cyclin E is induced and it associates with Cdk2 to form active complexes that phosphorylate Rb. Hyper-phosphorylation of Rb deactivates it, causing the release of E2F transcription factors and facilitating the transcription of genes essential for DNA synthesis, so that the cells then progress into the S phase (Lundberg and Weinberg, 1998, Vermeulen et al., 2003, Bagga and Bouchard, 2014). The activities of cyclin-Cdk complexes are regulated by cellular Cdk inhibitors (CKIs) (Vermeulen et al., 2003, Harper and Brooks, 2005), which can be grouped into two families. The CKIs of the INK4 family bind to Cdk4 and Cdk6 and block cyclin D-Cdk4/6 activities (Harper and Brooks, 2005, Sherr, 1994). The CKIs of the Cip/Kip family, which include P21Cip1 and P27Kip1, are potent inhibitors of cyclin E-and A-dependent Cdk2 (Sherr and Roberts, 1999).",

            "text": "Many viruses, including DNA, RNA, and retroviruses, modulate the cell cycle to benefit their own replication. DNA viruses, whose primary site of replication is the nucleus, have been studied most extensively in terms of cell cycle control. Some small DNA tumorigenic viruses, including human papillomavirus (Reinson et al., 2015), simian virus (Rohaly et al., 2010, Lin and Lamb, 2000), and adenovirus, encode proteins that promote entry into the S phase, thereby avoiding competition for cellular DNA replication resources (Jiang et al., 2015). This virus-mediated alteration to the cell cycle may ultimately contribute to cancer progression (Hanahan and Weinberg, 2000). By contrast, some large DNA viruses (for example, herpesviruses) are able to elicit cell cycle arrest in the G0/G1 phase to limit the competition between the virus and the host for cellular DNA replication resources. Retroviruses, which also replicate in the nucleus, are also associated with cell cycle perturbations. For example, the Vpr protein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 is responsible for inducing cell cycle arrest at the G2/M phase, when the expression of the viral genes is optimal (Hrimech et al., 2000, He et al., 1995). Increasingly, RNA viruses, whose primary site of replication is the cytoplasm, have also been observed to alter the host cell cycle. In the coronavirus family, infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) induces a G2/M-phase arrest in infected cells that favors viral replication (Dove et al., 2006), while mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) replication and some severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) proteins induce cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase (Chen and Makino, 2004, Yuan et al., 2005).",

The mock-infected cells progressed normally through G0/G1 to G2/M phase but stopped at the G2/M phase because of the mitotic block. Only 2.3% of the mock-infected cells remained in the G0/G1 phase after 16 h of nocodazole treatment. However, more than 60% of the NDV-infected cells stayed in G0/G1 phase, indicating that fewer cells stayed in the G2/M phase when compared to the mock-infected cells (\nFig. 2A and B).

As shown in\nFig. 4A\u2013B, 78% of the cells were blocked in the G0 phase among the G0-phase-synchronized cells, 72% of the cells were blocked in the G1 phase among G1-phase-synchronized cells, and 59% of the cells were in G0/G1 phase among the normal unsynchronized cells.

For M synchronization, 93% of the cells were in the G2/M phase, with < 3% of the cells in G0/G1 phase. Cells were then simultaneously infected with NDV at a low MOI of 0.1. After 16 h, the expression level of viral NP protein was significantly higher in G1-phase-synchronized cells than those synchronized in the G0, G2, or M phases or in asynchronous cells (Fig. 4C-D). Analysis of progeny viral production at 16 h post infection indicated a greater viral production in the G1-phase-synchronized cells (~1.09 \u00d7 106 PFU/ml) than in progeny virus in the G0 (~1.70 \u00d7 104 PFU/ml), G2 (~1.00 \u00d7 104 PFU/ml), and M (~2.63 \u00d7 103 PFU/ml) phases or in asynchronous cells (~2.57 \u00d7 104 PFU/ml) (Fig. 4E).

C/EBP homologous protein (CHOP) is a downstream effector of PKR/ eIF2\u03b1/ATF4 and is also known as \u201cgrowth arrest and DNA damage-inducible gene 153\u201d (GADD153). Therefore, we hypothesized that CHOP might be involved in the attenuation of cyclin D1 and cyclin E expression. In order to address this question, we determined the activation of PERK/eIF2 \u03b1 signaling cascade at different time point post-infection. Coincided with our previous report (Liao et al., 2016), NDV infection activated the PERK/ eIF2\u03b1 signaling cascade by exhibiting increased phosphorylation of PERK and eIF-2\u03b1, as well as the increased level of CHOP expression. (\nFig. 6A). Importantly, exogenous expression of CHOP in HeLa cells by transfection of the PXJ40F-CHOP significantly enhanced the decreasing of cyclin D1 expression resulted by NDV infection (Fig. 6B). In contrast to overexpression, silencing the expression of CHOP by transfection of siCHOP prevented the decreasing of cyclin D1 induced by NDV infection (Fig. 6C). However, overexpression of CHOP had no significant effect on cyclin E, P21, P27 and P53 (Supplementary Fig. 1A). Although silencing of CHOP expression by siCHOP decreased cyclin E and P21 levels (Supplementary Fig. 1B), the reason that overexpression of CHOP had no effect on cyclin E and P21, and the final effect of CHOP knockdown-induced cyclin E and P21 decrease, require further study. These results suggested that NDV infection activated the PERK/ eIF2\u03b1/CHOP pathway, thereby involving this pathway in the G0/G1 phase cell cycle arrest via downregulation of cyclin D1.",

This accumulation depended on infection with replication-competent NDV, as UV-inactivated NDV failed to induce a G0/G1 phase arrest. We hypothesized that an arrest in the G0/G1 phase by NDV infection could create a more favorable environment for NDV replication. Both NDV NP protein production and progeny viral production were highest in cells synchronized in the G1 phase. This benefit can be explained by a number of hypotheses, including increased efficiencies of transcription, translation, and viral assembly. This indicates that the G1 phase of the cell cycle provides a beneficial environment for NDV replication. However, the exact mechanism needs further study.",

            "text": "Cyclin D1-Cdk4/6 complexes regulate G1 phase progression through phosphorylation of the downstream retinoblastoma (Rb) protein (Blomen and Boonstra, 2007). When Rb is in the hypo-phosphorylated form, it is active and represses cell cycle progression by binding and inhibiting E2F transcription factors, which are responsible for transcription of genes important for DNA synthesis (Vermeulen et al., 2003, Bagga and Bouchard, 2014). Consistent with the cell cycle profile data, NDV replication inhibited Rb hyper-phosphorylation. A significant decrease in cyclin D1 was seen in NDV-infected cells, but the amounts of the CKIs p21Cip1and p27Kip1 decreased unexpectedly, even with an increase in P53 expression in the infected cells. Therefore, the NDV-induced inhibition of Rb hyper-phosphorylation and G1/S progression did not appear to be a result of the activation of these CKIs.",

            "text": "The reduced levels of both cyclin D1 and cyclin E in infected cells might have reduced the formation of cyclin D1-Cdk4/6 complexes and cyclin E-Cdk2 complexes, which are important for S-phase entry. The reduced levels of these complexes could then lead to insufficient pRb hyper-phosphorylation, thereby inhibiting cell cycle progression in the G0/G1 phase. Some reports have indicated that NDV infection can result in a general decrease in cellular protein synthesis (Liao et al., 2016) and the inhibition of translation may contribute to the decreased levels of cyclin D1 and cyclin E. Moreover, NDV infection reportedly will activate the PERK-eIF2\u03b1-ATF4 cascade and inhibit protein translation in the host cells. As a downstream effector, CHOP plays an important role in the regulation of apoptosis. In this study, we showed that the PERK-eIF2\u03b1-ATF4-CHOP signal pathway was activated in the cells upon NDV infection. Overexpression of CHOP significantly enhanced the reduction of cyclin D1, whereas inhibition of CHOP expression by siCHOP transfection reversed the NDV-induced cyclin D1 decrease. In addition to the effect on cyclin D1 level, overexpression of CHOP could sufficiently induce the accumulation of cells in G0/G1 phase (Supplementary Fig. 2), which further proved the involvement of CHOP in NDV infection-induced G0/G1 cell cycle arrest. Given that CHOP is implicated in apoptosis (Maytin et al., 2001, Yamaguchi and Wang, 2004), our results suggest a novel role of CHOP as a link between apoptosis and cell cycle arrest induced by NDV infection.",
