Their binding alters the activity, stability, localization, and phosphorylation state of a target protein. The association of 14-3-3 proteins with the regulation of a wide range of general and specific signaling pathways suggests their crucial role in health and disease. Recent studies have linked 14-3-3 to several RNA and DNA viruses that may contribute to the pathogenesis and progression of infections. Therefore, comprehensive knowledge of host-virus interactions is vital for understanding the viral life cycle and developing effective therapeutic strategies. Moreover, pharmaceutical research is already moving towards targeting host proteins in the control of virus pathogenesis. As such, targeting the right host protein to interrupt host-virus interactions could be an effective therapeutic strategy. In this review, we generated a 14-3-3 protein interactions roadmap in viruses, using the freely available Virusmentha network, an online virus-virus or virus-host interaction tool. Furthermore, we summarize the role of the 14-3-3 family in RNA and DNA viruses. The participation of 14-3-3 in viral infections underlines its significance as a key regulator for the expression of host and viral proteins.",

Therefore, identifying the viral and host factors involved in viral infection is the main aim of virologists, in order to develop antiviral drugs. Drugs targeting viral proteins have clear disadvantages, such as viral subtype specificity, the rapid development of drug resistance, and low fidelity polymerases in the case of HIV and influenza viruses [2] . Therefore, considering the increasing threat of viral infections, focus is emerging on the need to identify novel, effective, and safe alternative therapies for viral infections. Targeting host proteins is an efficient alternative, since viruses are dependent on host proteins at multiple stages to achieve their replication cycles [3] [4] [5] .",

Therefore, comprehensive knowledge of host-virus interactions is important in order to understand the viral life cycle and to develop specific therapeutic approaches for the treatment of viral infections.

The Virusmentha database, which is freely available at https://virusmentha.uniroma2.it/, is the most comprehensive automatically updating resource available to date for viral interactions [42, 43] . The isoforms of 14-3-3 proteins, like \u03b2, \u03b8, \u03b5, \u03b3, \u03b7, and \u03b6, were found to interact with single-stranded RNA viruses (ssRNA) such as the influenza A virus (IAV), measles virus, human respiratory syncytial virus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), La Crosse virus, and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) viruses like herpes simplex virus type I, human herpes 4, hepatitis B virus (HBV), Nipah virus, Hendra virus and Murid herpesvirus (Table 1) . Investigators have confirmed these interactions using different approaches and methods, as described in Table 1 . Among all the isoforms of the 14-3-3 family, \u03b6, \u03b5, and \u03b8 are the most established and well-studied in the context of viral infections [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] . Similarly, co-IP using tandem affinity purification (TAP) and pull-down techniques are the most extensively used methods in the study of protein-protein interactions. ",

Further, the HCV core protein induces Bax-mediated apoptosis through HCV core-14-3-3 \u03b5 protein interaction [60] . In general, the host factor contributes positively to the budding of many negative-stranded RNA viruses, as reviewed elsewhere [66, 67] . However, in the case of parainfluenza virus 5 (PIV5), the M protein interacts with host protein 14-3-3 \u03b2 and negatively affects the production of PIV5 particles [61] . This shows that the interaction of the M protein with 14-3-3 \u03b2 is not related to virus budding. The 14-3-3 proteins have a crucial role to play in the regulation of cell cycle progression [10, 68] . They regulate cell cycle progression by altering the activities of cell division cycle 25C (Cdc25C), cyclin B1 (a regulatory protein involved in mitosis), checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1), and wee1 [10, 69, 70] . The 14-3-3 proteins interact with the accessory protein Vpr (viral protein R) of human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-1) and significantly regulate cell cycle progression by associating with Cdc25C [62] . Hence, Vpr induces G2-M cell cycle arrest by increasing the association between 14-3-3 \u03b8 and cell cycle regulatory factors (Cdc25C, cyclin B1, and Cdk1) during HIV infection [63] . In addition, Vpr interferes with, and alters the activity of, forkhead transcription factors (Foxo3a) by inhibiting their association with 14-3-3 proteins [71] .",

Interestingly, the Rep78 of AAV-2 does not interact with 14-3-3 proteins. Another key point is that the phosphorylation of Rep68 in the C-terminal seven amino acid (LARGHS) of Rep68 is necessary for the interaction of 14-3-3 with Rep68. Moreover, Yaffe et al. described that 14-3-3 proteins' interaction with target proteins often entails the phosphorylation of a serine residue [11] . Thus, this observation may provide a hint to understanding the role of Rep68 in AAV infections. Furthermore, 14-3-3-Rep68 interaction down-regulates the DNA binding activity of the target protein in an AAV infection [65] . This suggests that 14-3-3 proteins are functionally involved in the regulation of the Rep68 protein during the viral life cycle.",

Immunity which is 14-3-3-mediated may guide the rational design of therapeutics, and this can be seen in many virus infections [73] as well as mosquito-transmitted Zika and dengue viruses [74] [75] [76] . In a very recent study, the NS3 protein of the Zika virus interacted with 14-3-3 \u03b5 and 14-3-3 \u03b7 to inhibit RIG-I and the melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5) signaling pathway [75] . Notably, 14-3-3 \u03b7 was also reported to promote antiviral signaling by MDA5 in HCV infection [77] . In the dengue virus, 14-3-3 \u03b5 binds to the NS3 protein and prevents RIG-I from translocating to the mitochondrial antiviral signaling (MAVS) protein adapter, thereby blocking antiviral signaling [76] . Liu et al. reported 14-3-3 \u03b5 as a critical mediator for the relocation of RIG-I from cytosol to mitochondrial-associated MAVS, as it establishes a translocon complex with RIG-I and TRIM25, eventually triggering an antiviral response [78] .",

This binding allows the regulation of nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of N protein in a phosphorylation-dependent manner. Additionally, our group has shown that N protein induces apoptosis by reducing the expression level of 14-3-3 \u03b8 in the absence of growth factors (serum), which contributes to the accumulation of the phosphorylated N protein in the nucleus [78] . Likewise, coronavirus 2, or COVID-19, originated from China sharing similar demographic profiles, and laboratory and radiological findings with SARS and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) [80] . In SARS, our group has demonstrated that N protein is phosphorylated by multiple kinases (cyclin-dependent kinase, glycogen synthase kinase, and casein kinase II) and significantly interferes with cellular machinery by binding to 14-3-3 proteins through phosphorylation-dependent protein-protein interactions. This suggests that this discovery may provide new insights into a possible mechanism for the phosphorylation-dependent nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of the N protein and could be a potential antiviral strategy against COVID-19.",

According to Kim et al., HBx induces apoptosis by inhibiting the association between 14-3-3 \u03b5 and Bax, thereby enhancing mitochondrial-Bax translocation and cytochrome C release [86] .

These viral-14-3-3 interactions may change the typical distribution and disrupt the original functions of 14-3-3 proteins. For example, HBV, HCV, and HSV viruses were directly associated with, or inhibited, 14-3-3 proteins from inducing apoptosis. Therefore, monitoring and manipulating 14-3-3 proteins may represent new diagnostic and therapeutic targets for virus infections. The development of therapeutics, including drugs and vaccines, is highly dependent on the knowledge gained from investigating host-virus interactions. As such, interrupting host-virus interactions by targeting the right host factor might be a highly effective strategy for treating viral infections.",
