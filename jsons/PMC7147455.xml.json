This is presented in the form of certain clinical signs and symptoms which is known as \u201c sick-bird syndrome.\u201d The pet birds have their unique physiology and anatomy and their metabolic turnover is quite high. The feeding practice adopted by owner may have an impact over their health status. Birds are kept confined with limited exercise and they are deliberately kept isolated from their foraging behaviour. All these may have an impact over their health status. Diagnosis of these diseases is necessary to adopt a correct treatment or management protocol. However, this is rather complex in caged birds as many of the birds may not exhibit any clinical manifestation as such. By the time these symptoms are presented birds become really sick. Many of systemic diseases are presented with same cluster of symptoms. Moreover, they have a tendency to hide their illness as common tendency of all prey animals. Therefore, the observable and detectable clinical signs indicate a grave concern. Even a little manipulation may lead to serious consequences.",

            "text": "The underlying mechanism of diabetes is poorly understood in birds. Unlike mammals where insulin has a predominant role in DM, in birds blood glucose level seems to be controlled by a complex hormonal milieu. In comparison to mammalian pancreas, avian pancreas has a low proportion of insulin secreting cells and 5\u20136 times higher number of glucagon producing cells. Circulating glucagon concentration in avian blood is 10\u201350 times higher than the mammalian blood. Glucagon as a catabolic hormone plays a pivotal role in gluconeogenesis, lipolysis and glycogenolysis to augment the blood glucose level, while insulin controls the entry of glucose in the cells and its utilization. In birds particularly in granivorous species, Glucagon is considered to play a more relevant role for development of DM. However, other factors like somatostatin, growth hormone, epinephrine, thyroxine, prolactin, pancreatic polypeptides and corticosteroid may have a modulatory role in development of persistent hyperglycemia. Hyper production of any of these hormones either due to tumor of the hormone producing cells or due to paraneoplastic syndrome may leadto such condition. Islet cell carcinoma with DM has been described in a parakeet.",

However, detection of blood glucose level is tricky in birds as the avian blood glucose level is higher than in mammalian. Therefore, consistently higher level of blood glucose 38\u201344 mmol/l is indicative of DM in birds. Other than glucose, presence of ketone bodies in urine is also indicative of DM in birds. Clinical symptoms in some other conditions often resemble with the classical symptoms of DM in birds. Polyuria/polydipsia (PU/PD) syndrome is very common in pigeons which fed the squabs crop milk possibly due to decreased concentration of circulating prolactin. Likewise, infection of paramyxovirus serotype-1 may cause lasting PU/PD syndrome in pigeons. Again psychogenic PU/PD is also not uncommon in caged birds. Further, glycosuria has been detected in birds like African Grey Parrot without hyperglycemia. Thus glycosuria, even though an important indicator, cannot be considered alone for diagnosis of DM in avian. Moreover, other conditions like diabetes insipidus, medication with corticosteroids, diuretics, progesterone, renal or hepatic insufficiency, other hormonal irregularities should be considered before definite diagnosis of DM in birds.",

In birds it is more difficult as it is not easy to monitor the blood glucose level and thereby to evaluate the effect of the hypoglycemic drugs. The main objective of the treatment is to lower down the blood glucose level and maintain it. The treatment constitutes of insulin and other hypoglycemic drugs like sulfonylurea. The acute rise of blood glucose level can be treated with short acting insulin @ 0.1\u20130.2 U/kg. However, to maintain the blood glucose level persistently long acting insulin is prescribed with a varying dose (0.067\u20133.3 U/kg OD/BID) depending upon the clinical improvement and the blood glucose or urinary glucose level. Insulin is recorded to cause hypoglycemic shock in human. However, such instances were not recorded in birds. But possibility of such fallout cannot be denied. To avoid such happenings repeated sampling is required to monitor the blood glucose level making this quite difficult in birds. Oral hypoglycemic agents like sulfonylurea is good alternative. Sulfonylurea is known to stimulate the pancreatic beta cell to secrete endogenous insulin and to increase tissue sensitivity towards insulin. However, its efficacy in birds with insulin resistance is not properly known. Although insulin has been reported for treatment of DM in birds, its real efficacy is controversial in granivorous birds which are known to exhibit insulin insensitivity. Carnivorous birds may be more amicable to insulin therapy.",

Stress factors including extreme or adverse climate conditions like extreme cold climate of winter or hot temperature in summer, social stress may instigate such condition. Low humidity in winter may induce extreme pruritus leading to self-mutilation. Lack of fresh air, sunlight, light/dark cycle is the important factors to be considered. Nutritional deprivation is another cause for such condition. Basic diets are often deficient in essential skin nutraceuticals like zinc, vitamin A, E or omega-3\u2014fatty acids that may cause such skin or feather abnormality. Again, preservatives, pesticides, dye present in diet may have such deleterious consequences. The general systemic disorders like neoplasm, hepatic dysfunction, coelomic cavity granuloma, hypothyroidism, allergy and zinc toxicities should be looked for as these may induce such intense pruritus. Other psychological factors must be considered when such mutilating behavior is noticed like prolonged captivity, lack of interaction with the flock or with the owner, lack in the scope of reproductive behavior.",

Almost 80% of the nitrogenous waste is being excreted in the form of uric acid in birds via tubular secretion. As this process is independent of tubular water reabsorption, hydration status of the birds hardly influence the uric acid excretion. However, impairment of kidney function may interfere the excretion of uric acid leading to hyperuricemia. In human hyperuricemia occurs when the plasma concentration of uric acid is more than 380\u2013400 \u00b5mol/l. However, solubility of uric acid is higher in birds due to higher body temperature as well as higher sodium concentration in the avian plasma. However, when renal function is severely compromised at the level of about 70%, plasma uric acid concentration is abruptly elevated with deposition of uric acids in several locations. The high dietary protein level was often recorded to precipitate high uric acid level in the birds. This is common in budgerigars for the protein concentration of the feeding pellets. Surplus protein is catabolized and nitrogenous waste is converted into uric acid. When the total amount of uric acid produced overpower the clearing efficacy of the kidney, hyperuricemia develops and uric acid is deposited in various places. The higher plasma concentration of uric acid often leads to the development of articular gout with formation of deformed limbs and joints. Synovial joints sheaths and joints are preferred predilection sites possibly because of the lower temperature of these areas. Gradual accumulation of uric acid leads to formation of \u201ctophi\u201d and nodules.",

This precursor protein is necessary for amyloid AA type development and certain amino acid substitutions may facilitate amyloidogenicity for unstable intermediate protein conformations required for the whole process. Other favouring factors include\u2014amyloid-enhancing factor, an altered basement membrane protein and the presence of certain inorganic ions such as calcium and sulphate. Recent studies have suggested that vaccination may also be a triggering factor for induction of amyloidosis in commercial birds. In general it is thought that amyloid may be of primary origin where no triggering or inciting cause can be identified or it may be secondary to prolong infection with a persistent antigenic stimulation. In case of ducks persistent stress is generally thought as an inciting factor for amyloidosis. Amyloid arthropathy was reported with Enterococcus faecalis and Mycoplasma synoviae infection.
