Each of these semantic contexts links the same user set with a distinct edge set.

Furthermore, each of these attributes only uncovers a specific type of relation. For example, a view that only uses the location-modality will contain venues only connected by their colocation in a common geographical unit and will prioritize physical proximity over any other attribute. Broadly, each of these views is characterized by a semantic context and encodes modality-specific relations between restaurants. These views, although informative, are complementary and only record associations within the same modality. While each of these views encodes a part of the interactions within the network, performance on a downstream task relies on a suitable combination of views pertinent to the task [5].",

As such, they have been used for inference in large multimodal collections where a single modality may not carry sufficient information [2]. Initial work in this domain was structured around the task of captioning unseen images using correlations learned over multiple modalities (tag-propagation or auto-tagging). Pan et al. use a graph-based model to discover correlations between image features and text for automatic image-captioning [21]. Urban et al. use an Image-Context Graph consisting of captions, image features and images to retrieve relevant images for a textual query [32]. Stathopoulos et al. [28] build upon [32] to learn a similarity measure over words based on their co-occurrence on the web and use these similarities to introduce links between similar caption words. Rudinac et al. augment the Image-Context Graph with users as an additional modality and deploy it for generating visual-summaries of geographical regions [25]. Since we are interested in discovering multimodal similarities between restaurants, we use a graph layout similar to the one proposed by Pan et al. [21] for the image auto-captioning task but replace images with restaurants as central nodes. Other nodes containing textual features, visual features and users are retained. We also add categorical information like cuisines as a separate modality, allowing them to serve as semantic anchors within the representation.",

            "text": "Existing random walk-based embedding methods are extensions of the Random Walks with Restarts (RWR) paradigm. Traditional RWR-based techniques compute an affinity between two nodes in a graph by ascertaining the steady-state transition probability between them. They have been extensively used for the aforementioned auto-captioning tasks [21, 25, 28, 32], tourism recommendation [15] and web search as an integral part of the PageRank algorithm [20]. Deep Learning-based approaches build upon the traditional paradigm by optimizing the co-occurrence statistics of nodes sampled from these walks. DeepWalk [22] uses nodes sampled from short truncated random walks as phrases to optimize a skip-gram objective similar to word2vec [17]. Similarly, node2vec augments this learning paradigm with second-order random walks parameterized by exploration parameters p and q which control between the importance of homophily and structural equivalence in the learnt representations [8]. For a homogeneous network, random walk based methods like DeepWalk and node2vec assume that while the probabilities of transitioning from one node to another can be different, every transition still occurs between nodes of the same type. For heterogeneous graphs, this assumption may be fallacious as all transitions do not occur between nodes of the same type and consequently, do not carry the same semantic context. Indeed, our initial experiments with node2vec model suggest that it is not designed to handle highly multimodal graphs. Clements et al. [5] demonstrated that in the context of content recommendation, the importance of modalities is strongly task-dependent and treating all edges in heterogeneous graphs as equivalent can discard this information. Metapath2Vec [6] remedies this by introducing unbiased walks over the network schema specified by a metapath [29], allowing the network to learn the semantics specified by the metapath rather than those imposed purely by the topology of the graph. Metapath-based approaches have been extended to a variety of other problems. Hu et al. use an exhaustive list of semantically-meaningful metapaths for extracting Top-N recommendations with a neural co-attention network [10]. Shi et al. use metapath-specific representations in a traditional matrix factorization-based collaborative filtering mechanism [27]. In this work, we perform random walks on sub-networks of a restaurant-attribute network containing restaurants and attribute modalities. These attribute modalities may contain images, text or categorical features. For each of these sub-networks, we perform random walks and use a variant of the heterogeneous skip-gram objective introduced in [6] to generate low-dimensional bimodal embeddings. Bimodal embeddings have several interesting properties. Training relations between two modalities provide us with a degree of modularity where modalities can be included or held-out from the prediction model without affecting others. It also makes training inexpensive as the number of nodes when only considering two modalities is far lower than in the entire graph.",

We add a node for every geographical cell that contains at least one restaurant within it.Image Features: Images of a restaurant reflect its visual look-and-feel. These images may depict e.g. the interior, food and drinks, or people enjoying their meal. To extract a high-level semantic representation from these images, we deploy the ResNet-18 network [9] trained on the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC) dataset [26] with 1000 semantic concepts and use the penultimate layer output as a compressed low-dimensional representation for the image. Since the number of available images for each venue may vary dramatically depending on its popularity, adding a node for every image can lead to an unreasonably large graph. To mitigate this issue, we cluster image features for each restaurant using the K-Means algorithm and use the cluster centers as representative image features for a restaurant, similar to Zah\u00e1lka et al. [35]. We chose K = 5 as a reasonable trade-off between the granularity of our representations and tractability of generating embeddings for this modality.User Review Features: The way patrons write about a restaurant and the usage of specialized terms can contain important information about a restaurant that may be missing from its categorical attributes. For example, usage of the Indian cottage cheese \u2018Paneer\u2019 can be found in similar cuisine types like Nepali, Surinamese, etc. and user reviews talking about dishes containing \u2018Paneer\u2019 can be leveraged to infer that Indian and Nepali cuisines share some degree of similarity. To model such effects, we collect reviews for every restaurant. Since individual reviews may not provide a comprehensive unbiased picture of the restaurant, we chose not to treat them individually, but to consider them as a single document. We then use a distributed bag-of-words model from [13] to generate low-dimensional representations of these documents for each restaurant. Since the reviews of a restaurant can widely vary based on its popularity, we only consider the 10 most recent reviews for each restaurant to prevent biases from document length getting into the model.Users: Since TripAdvisor does not record check-ins, we can only leverage explicit feedback from users who chose to leave a review. We add a node for each of the users who visited at least two restaurants in Amsterdam and left a review.\n",

Since metapaths, in our case, are essentially paths over the modality set, they can be used to encode inter-modality correlations. In this work, we generate embeddings with two specific properties: All metapaths are binary and only include transitions over 2 modalities. Since venues/restaurants are always a part of the metapath, we only include one other modality.During optimization, we only track the short-range context by choosing a small window size. Window size is the maximum distance between the input node and a predicted node in a walk. In our model, walks over the metapath only capture short-range semantic contexts and the choice of a larger window can be detrimental to generalization. For example, consider a random walk over the Restaurant - Cuisine - Restaurant metapath. In the sampled nodes below, restaurants are in red while cuisines are in blue.  Optimizing over a large context window can lead to McDonald\u2019s (fast-food cuisine) and Kediri (Indonesian cuisine) being placed close in the embedding space. This is erroneous and does not capture the intended semantics which should bring restaurants closer only if they share the exact attribute.\n",
