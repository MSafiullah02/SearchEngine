Expression of these genes and their associated 72 programs in the nasal airway epithelium is of particular interest given that the nasal 73 epithelium is the primary site of infection for upper airway respiratory viruses, including 74 coronaviruses, and acts as the gateway through which upper airway infections can 75 spread into the lung. The airway epithelium is composed of multiple resident cell types 76 5 (e.g., mucus secretory, ciliated, basal stem cells, and rare epithelial cell types) 77 interdigitated with immune cells (e.g. T cells, mast cells, macrophages), and the relative 78 abundance of these cell types in the epithelium can greatly influence the expression of 79 particular genes 8-10 , including ACE2 and TMPRSS2. Furthermore, since the airway 80 epithelium acts as a sentinel for the entire respiratory system, its cellular composition, 81 along with its transcriptional and functional characteristics, are significantly shaped by 82 interaction with environmental stimuli. These stimuli may be inhaled (e.g., cigarette 83 smoke, allergens, microorganisms) or endogenous, such as when signaling molecules 84 are produced by airway immune cells present during different disease states. One such 85 disease state is allergic airway inflammation caused by type 2 (T2) cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, 86 IL-13), which is common in both children and adults and has been associated with the 87 development of both asthma and COPD in a subgroup of patients [11][12][13] . T2 cytokines are 88 known to greatly modify gene expression in the airway epithelium, both through 89 transcriptional changes within cells and epithelial remodeling in the form of mucus 90 metaplasia 11, 14, 15 . Microbial infection is another strong regulator of airway epithelial 91 expression. In particular, respiratory viruses can modulate the expression of thousands 92 of genes within epithelial cells, while also recruiting and activating an assortment of 93 immune cells 16-18 . Even asymptomatic nasal carriage of respiratory viruses, which is 94 especially common in childhood, has been shown to be associated with both genome-95 wide transcriptional re-programming and infiltration of macrophages and neutrophils in 96 the airway epithelium 19 , demonstrating how viral infection can drive pathology even 97 without overt signs of illness. 98 99 6 Genetic variation is another factor that may regulate gene expression in the airway 100 epithelium. Indeed, expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analyses carried out in 101 many tissues have suggested that as many as 70% of genes expressed by a tissue or 102 organ are under genetic control 20 . Severity of human rhinovirus (HRV) respiratory illness 103 has specifically been associated with genetic variation in the epithelial genes CDHR3 21 104 and the ORMDL3 22 and, given differences in genetic variation across world populations, 105 it is possible that functional genetic variants in SARS-CoV-2-related genes could partly 106 explain population differences in COVID-19 clinical outcomes. 107 108 Finally, there are important questions regarding the host response to SARS-CoV-2 109 infection. For example, it is unclear whether specific antiviral defenses in the epithelium 110 are blocked by SARS-CoV-2 or whether the virus may trigger epithelial or immune cell 111 pathways that prolong airway infection, and/or even incite a hyperinflammatory state in 112 the lungs in some individuals that leads to more severe disease. Although large cohorts 113 of subjects infected by the novel coronavirus are still lacking, much can be learned by 114 exploring transcriptional responses to other coronavirus strains. In particular, because 115 nasal airway brushings capture both epithelial and immune cells present at the airway 116 surface, such samples collected from a cohort of subjects infected by a range of viruses 117 provide an opportunity to comprehensively investigate the potentially varied and 118 cascading effects of coronavirus infection on airway expression and function. 119 120",

In fact, an 60 estimated 5.7% of COVID-19 illnesses are fatal 3 . Enhanced risk of poor outcomes for 61 COVID-19 has been associated with a number of factors including advanced age, male 62 sex, and underlying cardiovascular and respiratory conditions 4, 5 . Yet, while the majority 63 of serious COVID-19 illness occurs in adults over 60, children are also thought to be 64 highly susceptible to infection.

However, we caution that a cell may not need to be TMPRSS2 + to be susceptible 420 to infection, since it has been demonstrated the TMPRSS2 protein is secreted from 421 nasal airway epithelial cells 26 . We also caution that scRNA-seq data are known to exhibit biases in gene detection, and thus the level and frequency of ACE2 expression 423 across cells may be much higher than we observe here. In line with this possibility we 424 observe more moderate levels of ACE2 expression in our bulk RNA-seq data on nasal 425 brushings. 426 427 Airway inflammation caused by type 2 cytokine production from infiltrating immune cells 428 plays a prominent role in the control of cellular composition, expression, and thus 429 biology of the airway epithelium 11, 13, 23, 27 . Moreover, while T2 airway inflammation is an 430 important driver of T2-high asthma and COPD disease endotypes, it is also associated 431 with atopy in the absence of lung disease, a very common phenotype in both children 432 and adults. In fact, among the children in this study, we find that 43% of non-asthmatics 433 were scored as T2-high based on expression profile, further substantiating the high 434 prevalence of T2 airway inflammation outside of those with lung disease. Our data 435 suggest that airway epithelial TMPRSS2 expression is highly upregulated by T2 436 inflammation, and specifically by IL-13. Both our network and single cell data show that 437 TMPRSS2 is most prominent in less developed \"early secretory\" cells as well as in more 438 mature mucus secretory cells. Based on our in vitro data, IL-13 upregulates TMPRSS2 439 across nearly all types of epithelial cells, but the core of this effect appears to be in the 440 metaplastic mucus secretory cells that are generated as a consequence of IL-13 441 signaling 14, 15 . In fact, our network data suggest that, although TMPRSS2 expression is 442 highly correlated with that of a co-expressed network of mucus secretory genes 443 characterizing \"normal\", non-metaplastic, mucus secretory cells, it's correlated even 444 more strongly with a network that characterizes mucus secretory cells undergoing IL-13-445 induced metaplasia. In contrast to enhanced levels of TMPRSS2, T2 inflammation, 446 whether observed in vivo or induced with IL-13 stimulation, precipitated a dramatic 447 reduction in levels of epithelial ACE2, thus complicating expectations for how T2 448 inflammation might affect overall risk for a poor COVID-19 outcome. Germane to this 449 question, a recent study of 85 fatal COVID-19 subjects found that 81.2% of them 450 exhibited very low levels of blood eosinophil levels 4 . Blood eosinophil levels are a 451 strong, well-known predictor of airway T2 inflammation and were strongly correlated 452 with T2 status in our study as well 11, 23 . Together, these studies provisionally suggest 453 that T2 inflammation may predispose individuals to experience better COVID-19 454 outcomes through a decrease in airway levels of ACE2 that override any countervailing 455 effect from increased expression of TMPRSS2. However, both in vitro experiments 456 examining IL-13 effects on SARS-CoV-2 infection and empirical data on COVID-19 457 outcomes among T2-high and T2-low patients will certainly be needed to determine 458 whether this common airway inflammatory endotype ultimately protects against or 459 exacerbates COVID-19 illness. As mentioned above, we note that measurement of 460 blood eosinophil levels could be used as an informative and more accessible (albeit less 461 powerful) proxy for investigating the association between airway T2 inflammation and 462 outcomes of COVID-19. Moreover, given the higher frequency of T2 inflammation 463 among asthmatic subjects, this population should be monitored especially closely given 464 the enhanced risk of complications due to respiratory virus infection in those with 465",

While both the effect size and explanatory power of these variants paled in 493 comparison to the influence of T2 inflammation and interferon signaling in multi-variable 494 modeling of expression for these genes, the effect of these variants may still be strong 495 enough to alter infection rates and or illness severity, especially in the populations 496",

Clearly, severe disease often entails development of 502 pneumonia, possibly resulting from an expanded tropism of SARS-CoV-2 to include 503 lower lung airway and alveolar cells. The most severe patients also appear to 504 experience an exuberant immune response, characterized a \"cytokine storm\" 24 , 505 occurring with and possibly driving the development of acute respiratory distress 506 syndrome (ARDS). Supposing that aspects of epithelial response to coronavirus family 507 members would be shared, including with SARS-CoV-2, we examined in vivo 508 coronavirus infection among the GALA II children. We found that CoV infections elicit a 509 broad airway transcriptome response, similar to HRV infections, and we identified a 510 panel of cytokines and transcription factors that likely regulate these responses. In 511 particular, we found that IL-6 was predicted to regulate responses to CoV and was itself 512 upregulated with these infections. These data support the recent investigation of 513 tocilizumab (IL-6R blocking antibody) for the treatment of COVID-19 illnesses 24 . 514 Strikingly our analysis revealed an increased cytotoxic immune response with CoV 515 infection, driven by the differential presence and activity of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells and 516 NK cells, as compared to the more heavily neutrophil-based responses to HRV 517 infection. Although preliminary, this finding, if similarly occurring with SARS-CoV-2 518 infection, could partly explain the dramatic inflammation observed in SARS-CoV-2 519 patients, which can extend to the distal lung. 520",
