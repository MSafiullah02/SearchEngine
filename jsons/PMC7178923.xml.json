COVID-19 spreads rapidly and can live in the air for over 3 hr and on some surfaces for up to 3 days (van Doremalen et al., 2020). A recent analysis from China indicates that approximately 80% of people infected with COVID-19 are asymptomatic or have mild symptoms (Wu & McGoogan, 2020).3 ABA providers who continue to conduct in-person services are at an increased risk of contracting COVID-19 themselves because of their frequent contact with others, are likely to be unaware they have it, and will be unaware they are spreading the disease to others, including clients and their families. Ultimately, continuing to provide in-person ABA services increases the risk that more people will become ill than if in-person ABA services stop.",

            "text": "Participating in the spread of COVID-19 is ethically consequential for several reasons. As of writing this article on March 28, 2020, research from China estimates 14% of people who contract COVID-19 will require hospitalization and 2.3% of people who contract COVID-19 will die (Wu & McGoogan, 2020). This is ethically consequential for the health and life of ABA consumers and providers. Individuals with ASD are more likely to have allergies and autoimmune diseases than the general population (Chen et al., 2013), placing them at greater risk of requiring hospitalization because of COVID-19. Under ideal conditions, many hospitals are not prepared to support the communication and behavioral needs of individuals with ASD (Vaz, 2010). To compound the previous points, the states of Arizona and Washington have issued policies that people with disabilities have a lower priority to receive critical and lifesaving medical care (Silverman, 2020), although these policies are out of compliance with the Office of Civil Rights (2020) bulletin issued on March 28, 2020. Even so, confusion around this issue could further limit access to lifesaving care for people with disabilities, including individuals with ASD. Efforts to keep clients out of the hospital must, therefore, be a top priority for ABA providers during the COVID-19 pandemic. The BACB Professional and Ethical Compliance Code for Behavior Analysts (2014; hereafter referred to as the BACB Code) obligates Board Certified Behavior Analysts (BCBAs) to operate in the best interests of their clients (Section 2.0) and to put their clients\u2019 care first (Section 2.04d).4 In some situations, maximizing the best interest of a client and placing his or her care first might mean stopping in-person ABA services to reduce the likelihood that ABA consumers or providers (especially behavior technicians) contract COVID-19.",

In many locations, the current pandemic is placing severe economic strain on already-burdened communities (e.g., Haslem, 2020). Additionally, participating in the potential spread of COVID-19 raises the probability of increasing the burden on a health care system presently under tremendous resource strain (Emanuel et al., 2020). There are currently not enough health care resources for everyone who contracts COVID-19. Because of the lack of health care resources, health care providers must make decisions that balance maximizing benefits and minimizing harms for each patient versus maximizing benefits and minimizing harms for an entire community. ABA providers have not had to enter this conversation historically. But this conversation is on our doorstep. Additionally, the probability of increasing health care risks to others in our community and the broader public health care system is a relevant variable in the decision-making process as to whether to continue providing in-person ABA services.",

For the purpose of this article, extreme harm is defined as injury sufficient to warrant medical attention. Without existing data, it is unclear how many ABA consumers fall into this category, although it seems likely that ABA providers are capable of making reasonable assessments of this with their clients. However, we suspect it is a minority of consumers and that clients with these extremely severe behavioral topographies are an exception, not the norm. Nevertheless, in-person ABA services may be necessary to protect or sustain the life of a client in some situations, despite the risk of contracting COVID-19. It is additionally worth considering that school closures, stay-at-home orders, and overall massive changes to ABA consumers\u2019 daily routines may dramatically intensify problem behavior.",

Some clients may have a history of, or currently display, challenging behavior that carries some probability of risk of harm to themselves and others. A decision to cease or significantly alter in-person treatment could lead to an increase in the severity or intensity of challenging behavior (e.g., Briggs, Fisher, Greer, & Kimball, 2018; Fuhrman, Fisher, & Greer, 2016; Kimball, Kelley, Podlesnik, Forton, & Hinkle, 2018; Lambert, Bloom, Samaha, & Dayton, 2017; Romano & St. Peter, 2016), which could result in the client or others, such as a family member, being hospitalized. The probability of harm from challenging behavior has to be balanced against the probability of contracting COVID-19 through continued in-person services. To compound this calculation, hospitalization also carries an increased probability of an unaffected patient contracting the virus while hospitalized because hospitals carry increased risk of hospital-acquired infection and disease (e.g., Chowdhury, Miller, Lewis, Niesley, & Patel, 2016; Gestal, 1987; Haverstick et al., 2017). Thus, blanket decisions to stop all ABA services may place some ABA consumers at risk of severe harm to themselves or others, as well as, ironically, at an increased risk of contracting COVID-19 if hospitalized.",

Each option carries significant risk of harm to ABA consumers, ABA providers, and the larger geographical, medical, and ABA communities. As with many ethical dilemmas, this is a living, breathing decision-making context. Unlike many ethical dilemmas, the facts, probabilities, and risks of harm from contracting COVID-19 are dynamically changing. ABA providers will need to regularly reevaluate their decisions to provide or withhold treatment according to dynamically changing client needs. It is our position that this decision is best made on a case-by-case basis.",

This recommendation holds even if ABA providers are not in a jurisdiction currently under a shelter-at-home order. Fortunately, an alternative behavior exists that is reimbursable and executable using readily available resources. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has mandated that the telehealth delivery of ABA services can be reimbursed through health insurance companies (HHS, 2020). For those who lacked the infrastructure to provide telehealth services before the pandemic, the HHS has also stated that regulatory noncompliance law will be relaxed to allow health care providers to build out and learn to use telehealth modalities (HHS, 2020). Given the widely available and accessible nature of audio (e.g., phone) and video (e.g., FaceTime, Zoom) technology, most ABA providers should be able to manage some degree of contact with clients while adhering to social-distancing recommendations (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020). It is worth noting that some insurance funders strictly require HIPAA-compliant platforms in their documents approving the use of telehealth services, so best practice would be to exhaust compliant options first. In the event a noncompliant platform is used, this should be clearly stated as a risk to confidentiality in informed-consent documents presented before the provision of telehealth services.",

Remote service delivery requires a unique skill set that all individuals credentialed by the BACB might not have. Nevertheless, resources exist for professionals credentialed by the BACB to expand their scope of competence to execute a new treatment model (e.g., telehealth) while in-person services are temporarily withheld.",

One situation might be when the technological infrastructure required for remote service delivery is not in place for the ABA provider or consumer. Regardless, the potential risks of serious illness and death are likely greater than the risks of the temporary withdrawal of services if a lack of technological infrastructure is the only reason telehealth services cannot be delivered. In these situations, all reasonable attempts to build out the necessary infrastructure for remote service delivery should be made so that ABA services can resume as quickly as possible. Over 90% of Americans use the Internet (Anderson, Perrin, Jiang, & Kumar, 2019), and approximately 96% of Americans have a cell phone of some kind (Pew Research Center, 2019). Barriers that result from the lack of infrastructure can likely be addressed for most ABA consumers given the pervasive access to the Internet and cellular devices, along with the aforementioned changes that allow for telehealth and telephonic ABA services to be reimbursable.",

Although it is unclear exactly how much an intervention context needs to change before additional consent conversations are required, it is important to note that informed consent is regarded as an ongoing process and not a one-time decision (e.g., Bailey & Burch, 2016; Brody, 1989; Egan, 2008; Usher & Arthur, 1998).",

Ongoing risk assessment is important for all cases regardless of whether an ABA provider and ABA consumers agree that in-person ABA services should continue, stop, or transition to telehealth or other remote service delivery method. Within this conversation, it is important to note that some ABA providers may have preexisting conditions themselves that place them in a high-risk subgroup if they contract COVID-19. It is illegal for an employer to ask about the health status of an employee. To protect all ABA providers during the pandemic, agency leaders must respect any request for reassignment without penalizing the person who makes the request. Requiring behavior technicians, for example, to continue providing in-person services under threat of losing their jobs would be unethical and, in the long run, bad business for agency directors and owners. Rather, to avoid unduly influencing the ABA provider, the consent process should explicitly state the employee is not at risk of corrective action or loss of employment by avoiding in-person work during this time.",

However, the biological processes of infectious disease impact health differently than the behavioral processes of ABA. Continued in-person service delivery includes the possibility that an ABA provider negatively impacts the health of other people living in a client\u2019s home, as well as the health of the behavior technician\u2019s family, even if this in-person contact occurs in a school or clinic.
