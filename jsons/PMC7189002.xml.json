Strict social distancing measures have been applied and hospitals around the globe have had to implement drastic and quick changes to cope with the crisis. According to published statistics, a significant percentage of COVID-19 infections are acquired in hospitals [2], with the potential risk of cross-contamination among health care workers, which limits even further the capacity to respond to the pandemic. For these reasons, it is imperative to reorganize outpatient and in-hospital services in order to optimize the use of technical and human resources, but most importantly to protect patients, health care workers, and their families from the risk of transmission.",

The recommendations outlined in this document are in accordance with guidelines issued by international organizations to prevent the spread of COVID-19 infection [3\u20136] and have been adapted to the activities specific to our field. They will be in place while community-based measures are maintained by regulatory bodies at the international and local levels and could be modified in the short term depending on the behavior of the pandemic and the issuance of new global public health guidelines. In addition, we have proposed general recommendations for the antiarrhythmic management of patients with COVID-19 infection. In the absence of specific clinical studies guiding antiarrhythmic management in these patients, our recommendations are based on international consensus guidelines and are aimed to minimize unnecessary exposure risk while at the same time maintaining essential care for urgent arrhythmic conditions that, if untreated, could result in patient harm or clinical decompensation requiring hospital admission. The recommendations relative to remote consults and monitoring must conform to local regulations, which may vary between countries and institutions.",

It should be noted that antiarrhythmic drugs may be another component of a pharmacological regimen that often includes antivirals, antibiotics, and immunomodulators, with potential for pharmacological interactions and risk of pro-arrhythmia.We recommend coordination between the electrophysiology team and other hospital units in order to implement protocols of remote consultation when possible, especially in areas such as the intensive care unit or the emergency department.We recommend proper documentation of remote inpatient consults according to local regulations.In patients with supraventricular and ventricular arrhythmias, secondary causes should be investigated and treated: hypoxia, metabolic and electrolyte imbalances, proarrhythmic effect of drugs, or myocardial ischemia.In patients with new-onset ventricular arrhythmias and troponin elevation, myocarditis should be ruled out as a causal factor.In patients with AF/futter:Betablockers are recommended as first-line therapy.Use of amiodarone is reserved for patients with hemodynamic instability despite betablockers due to its potential interaction with other QT-prolonging drugs (hydroxychloroquine, azythromicin, lopinavir/ritonavir) used to treat COVID-19 infection.In patients treated with amiodarone and especially with concomitant use of other QT-prolonging drugs (hydroxychloroquine, azythromicin, lopinavir/ritonavir), frequent electrolyte and QT monitoring is recommended to minimize the risk of pro-arrhythmia.Early anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin is recommended for prevention of embolic events, reducing the need for transoesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) if electrical cardioversion is required.In patients treated with antivirals or immunomodulators the use of oral anticoagulants should be avoided due to potential interaction.In patients with VT/VF without reversible causes:Betablockers and/or amiodarone are recommended as first-line agents.Careful use of amiodarone is recommended, with frequent electrolyte and QT monitoring to minimize the risk of pro-arrhythmia, especially in patients with concomitant use of other QT-prolonging drugs (hydroxychloroquine, azythromicin, lopinavir/ritonavir).The use of amiodarone is contraindicated in patients with ventricular arrhythmias secondary to electrolyte imbalances and QT prolongation. These patients should be treated according to published guidelines.In patients with electrical storm not related to hypoxia, metabolic or electrolyte imbalances, or proarrhythmic effect drugs, management should include general anesthesia and betablockers in addition to amiodarone. In refractory cases, initiation of epidural anesthesia with bupivacaine could be considered.Patients with electrical storm refractory to the aforementioned measures should be evaluated in a case-by-case basis to decide possible escalation of therapies, including the use of ECMO.In patients with active COVID-19 infection who develop symptomatic or hemodynamically unstable bradyarrhythmias, insertion of a temporary pacemaker is recommended due to their potentially transient nature.When feasible, suspected or confirmed COVID-19 cases requiring electrophysiology procedures should be scheduled at the end of the day as extensive disinfection/cleaning would be required post-procedure.Cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) in COVID-19 patients with VF arrest involves a high risk of aerosolization and disease transmission. All participants should don full PPE for aerosol generating procedures (respirator, gown, gloves, and eye protection) before starting CPR in suspect or confirmed COVID-19 patients.",

If torsades de pointes is noted on telemetry, all QTc prolonging drugs should be discontinued.The US Food and Drugs Administration (FDA) has approved the use of KardiaMobile 6 L (AliveCore) to monitor the QTc duration in COVID-19 patients receiving QT-prolonging drugs [16]. This avoids exposure of ECG technicians to affected patients and unnecessary use of PPE.",
