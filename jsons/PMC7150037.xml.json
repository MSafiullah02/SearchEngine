It contains nutrients like carbohydrates, protein, fat, vitamins, and minerals, which provide nutritional support for the growth and maintenance of an organism. On the other hand, it is also a major cause for the ill health of people around the globe, as it acts as a common transmission route of diseases due to the presence of microorganisms and contaminants (Odeyemi and Sani, 2016). Food supports the growth of microorganisms, and sometimes it contains antinutritional components and toxins that a plant or animal produce for self-defense from which these foods are obtained (Adams and Moss, 2008). Microorganisms causing food-borne illness are found in a wide range of foods with various virulence factors and may illicit a diverse range of adverse responses that may be acute, chronic, or intermittent. Some microbial pathogens are invasive and may cause generalized infection; other pathogens produce toxins that cause severe damage in susceptible tissues and organs. The complications normally require medical care and frequently result sometimes in hospitalizations. There may be a risk of mortality, as not all the patients recover fully and may suffer from residual symptoms throughout life (Forsythe, 2002).",

They pose potential economical and health loss to society (Adams and Moss, 2003). They are the major contributors to the estimated 1.5 billion annual episodes of diarrhea in children under the age of 5 years, and up to 70% of such episodes are due to ingestion of contaminated foods. Hence, a child is caught up in malnutrition, infection, and many of them do not survive under these circumstances. The chronic sequelae (secondary complications) following food-borne infections are also the cause of concern recognized together with the variability of human response. The secondary complications may be more serious and result in dreadful chronic disorders or even death (Lindsay, 1997).",

The cost of food-borne salmonellosis is high, an estimated US$ 2.3 billion annually by FoodNet (Frenzen et al., 1999). In England and Wales, the medical costs and value of lives lost due to just five food-borne illnesses were estimated to be \u00a3300\u2013700 million per year (Roberts, 1996). In 1999 the cost of food poisoning in Australia was estimated to be $2.6 billion per year by ANZFA (The Australia New Zealand Food Authority) and in Canada is US$ 1.3 billion per year (Todd, 1989). The cost of food-borne illnesses in developing countries is more and determined to be billions of US dollars. The World Health Organization (WHO, 2015) estimates that almost 2 million children die every year from diarrhea worldwide.",

The cost benefits in preventing food-borne illness through the ensured food safety and laws have been estimated (Crutchfield et al., 1999). Thus there is considerable need, in both developed and developing nations, for more consistent steps to be taken to mitigate substantially the risks posed by the microbial food-borne pathogens. A significant proportion of deaths are caused by the contaminated foods. The food-borne illnesses are a major challenge of the people in administration, public health, medicine, food trade, environment management, food production, and processing, and thus coordinated and collaborative efforts are required to reduce the food-borne illnesses. Therefore in this chapter, various food-borne illnesses and the international laws involved in consumer safe food production and trade are discussed.",

Contamination of food mostly happens due to the infected food handlers, who carry bacteria in carbuncles and boils on their arms and hands (Quinn et al., 2001). Studies carried out in the United Kingdom and United States have revealed that cold cooked meat, poultry products, salted meats (ham), and corned beef are the most common vehicles for transmission of S. aureus.

Enterotoxins are strictly neurotoxic in nature and act on receptors in the gut, stimulating the vomiting center in the brain. Most potent enterotoxin produced by S. aureus is SEA followed by SED. Enterotoxin is a small, single-chain polypeptide with molecular weight ranging from 26 to 30 kDa. Enterotoxins of S. aureus are superantigen as they are able to stimulate a higher amount of T cells (Adams and Moss, 2008, Anderson and Pritchard, 2008). Enterotoxins of S. aureus are gut proteases and heat stable, with type SEB being the most heat resistant. Heat and proteases stability is explained on the bases of their compact structure due to single disulfide loop near the center of the peptide chain molecule. Enterotoxin also inhibits water and sodium absorption in the small intestine (Quinn et al., 2001).",

Salmonella may execute several mechanisms to skip acidic pH of the stomach, and reaches to the small intestine. Microflora of the intestine provide protection against colonization of pathogen to some extent, but administration of antibiotics kills normal microflora and helps the colonization of pathogen. In the intestine, salmonella uses mannose-resistant fimbriae to adhere to epithelial cells, and they are then engulfed by epithelial cells using receptor-mediated endocytosis. This is a prerequisite for pathogenicity, and it is responsible for nonphagocytic entry of pathogen into the host cell (Bryan et al., 1971, Adams and Moss, 2008). The ruffles assist uptake of the bacterium in membrane-bound vesicles, which often coalesce. The organism replicates in these vesicles and is subsequently released from the cells (Walderhaug, 2007). Advances in molecular techniques have revealed that a signaling molecule is synthesized on a 35\u201340 kb region of bacterial chromosome called \u201cpathogenicity island,\u201d which is responsible for the perversion of host cell and leads to uptake of bacterium (Adams and Moss, 2008).",

Enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) is responsible for infantile diarrhea in most developing counties, and leads to acute dehydration. Enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC) invades epithelial cells of the colon like Shigella but does not produce toxin.

Different strains of enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) secret heat-labile enterotoxin (LT), heat-stable enterotoxin a (STa), and heat-stable enterotoxin b (STb). These enterotoxins affect a number of important eukaryotic processes, such as increasing the concentration of intracellular messengers (cyclic AMP, GMP, and Ca+) leading to ion secretion in the intestinal lumen. Shiga-like toxin produced by enterohemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC) disrupts ribosomal RNA, which halts protein synthesis and intoxicated endothelial or epithelial cells die (Melton-Celsa and O\u2019Brien, 1998).

Important pathogenic agents involved in the outbreaks were S. aureus, Vibrio, Salmonella, E. coli, and Yersinia enterocolitica. Y. enterocolitica belongs to Enterobacteriaceae, gram-negative, facultative anaerobic, catalase-positive, and oxidase-negative responsible for gastroenteritis (Vemula et al., 2012). One hundred and fifty individuals were affected by the outbreak at Kharar town (Punjab) reported in 2009 after consuming kheer contaminated with S. enteritidis (Dikid et al., 2009). In the state of Madhya Pradesh (India), more than 100 children and adults were affected after consuming a snack tikki made up of potato balls fried in vegetable oil. Clinical and food samples were isolated and investigated in which S. aureus was found to be the pathogen of this outbreak (Nema et al., 2007).

These approaches will be very fruitful, if food handlers at final stages also have food safety education (Bredbenner et al., 2013). Toxin-producing pathogens and intoxication of already produced toxins in the food can be avoided by proper cooking at high temperature (Bryan et al., 1971). The data of food-borne diseases and their outbreaks should be maintained to investigate and identify the risk factors like infectious agent, relation with host, environmental factors, and the food as vector for that particular pathogen. It will further help in preventing the disease outbreaks (WHO, 2005). Other important measures for prevention of bacterial food-borne illness are improvement in personal hygiene, adequate cooking, heat processing, and refrigeration of food. The following control measures can be executed to eradicate food-borne bacterial disease throughout the world:1.Educating food handlers for proper personal hygiene.2.Prohibiting individuals with skin lesions or other abscess from handling food.3.Keeping food at proper refrigerated temperature.4.Avoiding the chances of cross-contamination.5.Proper disposal of leftout or contaminated food to avoid contamination of other food articles.6.Adequate washing and handling of raw food articles.7.Boiling of home canned vegetables for at least 3 minutes prior to serving in order to destroy botulinum toxin.8.Exposure of food to a temperature of 80\u00b0C for 30 minutes or boiling for 10 minutes to destroy preformed toxin I food.9.Proper refrigeration of left-out food (WHO, 2008).\n",

It is found in high concentrations at areal and the green part of the plant but also is found in potato tubers at low concentration (Shibamoto and Bjeldanes, 1993). Synthesis of \u03b1-solanine in potato tubers is stimulated by sunlight exposure, mechanical injury, and tuber aging. High concentration of \u03b1-solanine is unsafe for human consumption (Dalvi and Bowie, 1983, Jones, 1995) as it leads to inhibition of acetylcholinesterase, cell membrane disruption. Manifestations include itchiness in the neck region, increased sensitivity called hyperesthesia, drowsiness, stomach pain, labored breathing, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea (Shibamoto and Bjeldanes, 1993). A 1\u20135 mg/kg dose of \u03b1-solanine is highly toxic for humans, and 3\u20136 mg/kg doses leads to death (Tice, 1998).",

Identification of the source is difficult because of the long incubation period (Adams and Moss, 2008).

B and G refer to blue and green light emission by these compounds under ultraviolet light. Aflatoxins produced by these fungi are known to induce hepatocellular carcinoma in human and animals (Wu, 2013). These mycotoxins induce acute aflatoxicosis; manifestation includes abdominal pain, pulmonary edema, vomiting, and fatty infiltration and necrosis of the liver. Most cases of acute aflatoxicosis in humans were reported from developing nations (Shank et al., 1971). During the 1970s, about 97 fatal cases of aflatoxicosis were reported from western India due to consumption of heavily molded corn (Krishnamachari et al., 1975, Bhat and Krishnamachari, 1977).",

These fungi are pathogens of cereal crops worldwide and produce zearalenone as a side product of cell metabolism (Bennett and Klich, 2003). Chemically, zearalenone (Fig. 12.5B) is resorcyclic acid lactone described as 6-(10-hydroxy-6-oxo-trans-1-undecenyl)-B-resorcyclic acid lactone (Cheeke, 1998). This toxin produces estrogenic effects on farm animals (Schwarzer, 2009). Clinical symptoms include increased uterine size and secretions, swelling of the vulva, hyperplasia of mammary glands and secretion, increased incidences of pseudopregnancy, decreased libido, infertility, stillbirth, and complications of vaginal and rectal prolapses (Gupta et al., 2018). In humans, studies reported that zearalenone acts as a ligand for pregnane X receptor (hPXR), which activate transcription factors involved in the expression of many hepatic drug-metabolizing enzymes, including cytochrome P450 enzymes (Ding et al., 2006). In vitro studies carried out with different human cell lines revealed the effect of zearalenone on human estrogen and androgen receptors. Zearalenone found agonist in MCF-7 cells (breast cancer cell line) for estrogen receptor alpha (hER\u03b1) and antagonist for androgen receptor (hAR) in PALM cell line (Gupta et al., 2018).",

Infection of liver fluke is a food-borne trematodiases, and its transmission takes place through contaminated undercooked aquatic food. Infection of liver fluke is most prevalent in Southeast Asia and Latin America. International travel, human migration, and food trade pose the threat of spreading infection to the other parts of the world.

Some of the trophozoites in the intestine form cysts and excrete out with feces (Adam, 2001). Giardia is not invasive, and it is not confirmed how the diarrheal symptoms appears. Along with diarrhea, abdominal cramps, pain, and vomiting also exist (Adams and Moss, 2008).",

Food gets contaminated with harmful pathogens, chemicals, and toxins by cross-contamination, adulteration, anthropogenic activities, and different environmental factors, and consumption of such unhygienic and unsafe food leads to food-borne illnesses their outbreaks. The rapid globalization and ease of transportation of food across the countries are often the cause of spread of food-borne pathogens from one part to the world to another. To deal with food-borne illnesses, it is necessary rather mandatory to regulate the process of food from \u201cfarm to fork\u201d with stringent hygienic practices. There are agencies in every country vis-\u00e0-vis international agencies, which have framed regulations and laws in this concern that need to be strictly implemented by the regulatory bodies and observed by the food producers, processors, and traders to reduce the spread of food-borne illnesses. Some international regulations/laws made by several important agencies are discussed in the proceeding sections of this chapter.",

In addition, the rise in international trade in food has augmented the risk of transmission of food contaminants from one country to another, and the need to estimate the risk that infectious agents pose to human health has become crucial. Global emergence and reemergence of food-borne pathogens have made microbiological safety of food an important issue (Odeyemi and Sani, 2016). Globally, more than 250 sources of food-borne diseases have been identified. The increase in the incidence of food-borne diseases has led to the imposition of several food quality regulations in different countries (Scallan et al., 2011). Although the globalization and liberalization of world food trade offer many benefits and opportunities, these present new risks of microbial pathogen from the original point of processing and packaging to the consumers\u2019 locations thousands of miles away because of the global nature of food production, manufacturing, and marketing to spread. Most of the countries have introduced food control systems to ensure that foods are safe for human consumption so that people are protected against unsafe, adulterated, or poor-quality food (Gauthier and Mahabir, 2012). There are four major challenges that need to be addressed to safeguard the health of consumers (Brundtland, 2001):1.To set up consumer confidence from the farm to the table by assessing and upgrading existing food safety measures.2.To ascertain reasonable food safety levels and serve all countries to achieve those standards.3.To elaborate intercontinental standards for premarket compliance of genetically modified (GM) food.4.To ensure the safety and benefits of new products for consumers.\n",

The act itself sets out principles, while regulations contain various categories of products coming under the sovereignty. Food standards are components of the enforcement structure and are meant to implement the basic food laws as part of the regulation or separate enactments. The basic food laws should include the purposes and scope of the law, definitions of basic concepts, inspection and analytical procedures, enforcement, regulations for additives, pesticides, contaminants, and penalties.

The negotiations addressed Strategies for Assessing the Safety of Foods Produced by Biotechnology in 1990, Biotechnology and Food Safety in 1996, and Safety Aspects of Genetically Modified Foods of Plant Origin in 2000 and 2001. The latter negotiations specifically addressed survey on security that were elevated by a Codex intergovernmental ad hoc task force on foods derived from biotechnology and to examine the benchmarks essential for the risk evaluation of food and its ingredients produced with the assistance of viable or nonviable GM microorganisms (FAO/WHO, 2002, FAO/WHO, 2003).",

A Codex standard for any food should be evaluated in accordance with the format for Codex commodity standards and contain all the relevant sections listed therein. The CAC and its associated bodies are committed to revise Codex standards and related texts if required to ensure that these become consistent with and reflect latest scientific guidance. A standard may be revised or modified in accordance with the procedures of Codex standards when required for elaboration. Every member of the CAC is responsible for identifying any new scientific advice, which may warrant amendment of any existing Codex standards and presenting to the appropriate committee for desired improvements (Randell and Whitehead, 1997, FAO/WHO, 2010).",

WTO members negotiate and supervise the implementation of rules under trade agreements and examine the trade plans of its members (Acharya, 2016, WTO, 2010).

At the time of the GATT, the WTO was on ordinary customs duties (tariffs); today, it also includes all other measures that affect trade internationally.

These provide the framework for uniformity of quality and safety of food products and thus help in improving the efficiency of production and reduction in the cost and also open borders for the free transport of food products around the globe. A number of challenges including changes in environmental conditions that lead to food contamination, changes in food production and supply, changes in consumer preference and habits, and emergence of newer pathogens, toxins, and antibiotic resistance still exist that need to be taken care of.
