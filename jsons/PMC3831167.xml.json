Notably, bacterial pneumonias have been long appreciated to be a major complication of influenza infections, even after the advent of antibiotics. During the 2009 pandemic, bacteria pneumonias were present in 25\u201330% of severe cases requiring hospitalization, and up to 50% in small autopsy series, thus demonstrating the continued public health significance of influenza\u2013bacterial co\u2010infections despite the availability of vaccines and potent antibiotics.3, 4, 5, 6, 7\n",

First, many cases of viral\u2013bacterial co\u2010infections go undetected, particularly in the outpatient setting. A common scenario is a patient who presents to a clinic with a history of a (presumably viral) upper respiratory infection (e.g., nasal congestion, rhinorrhea, sore throat) which had improved initially, but then worsened a few days later and now has complaints that are suspicious for bacterial infection (e.g., productive cough, sinus pain, fevers). In these cases, an earnest search for the microbiologic etiologies is often not warranted. Second, even when further testing is performed, the diagnostic yield is limited by the sensitivity of currently available microbiologic tests and the ability to obtain certain types of clinical specimens (e.g., sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage). Furthermore, the early administration of antibiotics, while appropriate for clinical management of acutely ill individuals, can considerably diminish the yield of bacterial cultures. For these reasons, interest has turned to adjunctive molecular testing methods, such as nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) [e.g., viral respiratory polymerase chain reaction (PCR) panels] or direct antigen detection methods (e.g., for Streptococcus pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, influenza, etc.), which can improve the overall diagnostic yield but lack specificity. Thus, unless a study was performed as part of a large clinical trial with comprehensive protocols for diagnostic testing or the medical facility has strict diagnostic algorithms in place for workup of pneumonia, the true incidence of viral\u2013bacterial co\u2010infections is difficult to determine and likely underestimated.",

Acute otitis media in pediatric populations are often observed during viral outbreaks, most commonly respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus, human rhinovirus (HRV), and coronavirus.8, 9, 10, 11 A recently identified virus isolated from the human respiratory tract, human bocavirus,12 has emerged as a potentially important copathogen in acute otitis.13 It is believed that changes in the upper respiratory tract induced by antecedent viral infections are what facilitate bacterial invasion into the middle ear. The bacteria, which most frequently cause otitis, Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and non\u2010typeable Hemophilus influenzae, are normal members of the nasopharyngeal flora; viral infections appear to enable these bacteria to enter the middle ear\u2013and more importantly, flourish\u2013resulting in disease.14 Substantial variation exists in the patterns of viral\u2013bacterial co\u2010infections reported, depending on the patient population (e.g., location), prevalence of vaccination against pneumococcus, and method of microbiologic detection (e.g., middle ear aspirate, nasopharyngeal swabs) The viral\u2013bacterial combinations most strongly associated with acute otitis media include rhinovirus or RSV with M. catarrhalis, S. pneumoniae, or H influenzae;10, 13, 15, 16 however, this may also be attributable to the fact the RSV and rhinoviral infections are very common in the pediatric population.",

Retrospective analysis of specimens from the 1918 influenza pandemic has revealed that almost all fatal cases of pneumonia showed evidence of bacterial infection.19 Since then, epidemiologic studies during influenza pandemics and epidemics have demonstrated incidence of pneumonias peaking concurrently with influenza activity.20, 21, 22 Although evidence of bacterial infection was not present in all cases, when bacterial cultures were positive, it was almost always S. pneumoniae, S. aureus, S. pyogenes, H. influenzae, or a combination of these bacteria.21, 22, 23, 24 Generally, secondary bacterial pneumonia complicating influenza infection has been noted to be more severe and prolonged, with higher mortality rates.22, 23 However, some influenza seasons are characterized by lower rates of mortality demonstrating that viral factors (e.g., the influenza neuraminidase) other currently unknown factors are responsible for determining the incidence and severity of influenza\u2013bacterial co\u2010infections.24, 25, 26, 27, 28 Influenza seasons where H3N2 influenza A dominate appear to be weakly associated with higher rates of invasive pneumococcal infections, which may be attributable to the higher neuraminidase activity of H3N2 strains compared with H1N1.27, 29 Severe tracheobronchitis caused by less virulent bacteria is another frequently noted complication of influenza.22\n",

Invasive pneumococcal disease has been shown to be as strongly correlated with RSV as influenza, particularly among children.41, 42, 43, 44 This may, in part, reflect the higher prevalence of RSV infections among children with symptomatic lower respiratory infections.17, 18 A number of studies have described the patterns of viral\u2013bacterial co\u2010infections in children hospitalized with community\u2010acquired pneumonia (CAP).45, 46, 47, 48 In this population, rates of viral\u2013bacterial co\u2010infections usually range from 15% to 30%, with higher rates in the younger age groups (under 5 years of age). The most common causes of CAP and acute lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) in children are S. pneumoniae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and respiratory viruses, although in a large part of the world, H. influenzae and S. aureus, remain important causes. Thus, the types of viral\u2013bacteria co\u2010infections tend to vary by age group and geography, but generally represent the pathogens most commonly isolated in the study population (e.g., RSV\u2010S. pneumoniae, rhinovirus\u2013Mycoplasma) although almost any combination of respiratory virus\u2013bacterial pathogen has been observed. Although the widespread use of vaccination against H. influenzae type b has largely eliminated this as a cause of CAP in the United States and other high\u2010income countries, this pathogen causes an estimated 4\u00b71% of severe and 15\u00b77% of fatal cases of childhood pneumonias worldwide.49 In adults, viral\u2013bacterial co\u2010infection rates among patients with CAP are around 4\u201316% and are associated with more severe disease.50, 51 Influenza, rhinovirus, RSV, and adenovirus are the most common viruses isolated from patients with bacterial CAP.50 These epidemiologic studies are a reminder that viruses are an important etiologic agent of LRTIs, as well as a major cofactor in the development of severe bacterial pneumonia. Hence, clinicians should counsel patients who present with an initial respiratory viral infection of the potential risk of developing secondary bacterial infections, and to return if symptoms worsen. Conversely, clinicians caring for patients who present with evidence of severe lower respiratory tract infections when influenza is known to be circulating should consider the epidemiology of bacterial pathogens in this setting and consider empiric treatment of both influenza and S. aureus in addition to the usual regimen for community\u2010acquired pneumonia.",

Much of our understanding has arisen from studies conducted in animal models of sequential infections by influenza and various bacterial pathogens and has been comprehensively reviewed elsewhere;28, 55 hence, only the fundamental themes will be highlighted here.(Table 2)",

Activation of type I interferons (e.g., IFN \u03b1 and \u03b2), type II interferon (IFN\u2010\u03b3), and innate immune receptors responsible for recognizing influenza and other respiratory viruses [e.g., Toll\u2010like receptor (TLR)\u20103, Retinoic acid inducible gene (RIG)\u2010I] have all been shown to mediate susceptibility to secondary bacterial infections.53, 54, 83, 84, 85 Among the effects of these immune pathways are impairment in phagocytic cell function and recruitment, and inhibition of the IL\u201017 pathway possibly through IFN\u2010induced suppression of gamma\u2010delta T cells. Although these mechanisms have mainly been studied in the context of primary influenza infection, we have found that simply inducing type I IFNs in the lung by intranasal administration of poly I:C (ligand for TLR3 and RIG\u2010I) is sufficient to impair bacterial clearance of S. pneumoniae and MRSA, suggesting that these mechanisms may be operational in mediating susceptibility to bacteria following infection by other respiratory viruses.85 In addition, this also raises the possibility that a host may experience a mild or subclinical infection sufficient to induce an antiviral immune response, thereby decreasing the threshold of susceptibility to bacterial infection. These findings will need to be confirmed in human studies, but should raise some concern that efforts focused on augmenting antiviral immune responses as a strategy for treating pandemic influenza may paradoxically promote the development of secondary bacterial infections.",

Although S. pyogenes will be covered by the standard antibiotic regimens for CAP, if influenza is known to be circulating in the community, strong consideration should be made for additional S. aureus coverage, particularly in patients who are sick enough to require admission to the intensive care unit, presence of necrotizing/cavitary lesions, or with risk factors for a complicated course (e.g., elderly, comorbidities). Some of the guidelines have made specific recommendations for treating secondary bacterial pneumonias following influenza, given that the frequency of infection by certain bacteria, particularly S. aureus, increases in this setting.124, 125, 130, 137 During influenza season, in adult patients admitted with CAP, the combination of a beta\u2010lactam antibiotic with fluoroquinolone or macrolide should be sufficient for not only for the common CAP pathogens (e.g., S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, atypical bacteria), but also cover MSSA and S. pyogenes. However, if MRSA is of concern, vancomycin or linezolid should be started empirically, with the intent to discontinue these antibiotics if culture results return negative.124 In children, clindamycin is another alternative for MRSA.127\n",

The widespread of adamantine\u2010resistant influenza strains, including the 2009 H1N1 pandemic influenza, has severely limited the utility of this group of antivirals.138, 139 For patients with milder cases of influenza\u2010like illness and who are otherwise healthy, treatment with oseltamivir or zanamivir is recommended only if started within 48 hours of symptom onset as it can shorten duration of symptoms. In patients admitted to the hospital, however, antiviral treatment with oseltamivir beyond 48 hours after symptom onset may still be beneficial.140 Newer neuraminidase inhibitors are presently in development or undergoing clinical trials. Peramivir, which is administered intravenously, was made available in the United States during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic under an emergency use authorization. Although it is in phase III trials in the United States, it is approved for use in Japan and Korea.",

Vaccinations, antibiotics, and improvements in diagnosis and supportive care all have contributed to improved outcomes from viral\u2013bacterial co\u2010infections. Nonetheless, influenza and pneumonias remain the leading cause of death from infectious disease worldwide, with bacterial pneumonias still contributing to a substantial proportion of deaths during seasonal and pandemic influenza outbreaks. During influenza season, patients presenting with severe LRTIs should be treated empirically with both antiviral and antibacterial agents while awaiting results of microbiologic testing since distinguishing between single and polymicrobial infections can be problematic. An improved understanding of the pathogenetic mechanisms responsible for viral\u2013bacterial co\u2010infections will enable clinicians and public health officials to identify which patients are at risk of developing this potentially fatal complication, and aid in the development of therapeutic approaches aimed at mitigating the severity of co\u2010infections.",
