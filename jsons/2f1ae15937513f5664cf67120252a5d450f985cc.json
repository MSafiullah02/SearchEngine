In DNA microarrays (also known as DNA chips or biochips), each spot contains predefined short (25-to 70-nucleotide) singlestranded DNA oligonucleotides or larger (200-to 800-basepair) double-stranded DNA, which are known as probes. A microarray experiment consists of the hybridisation of a sample of target DNA in solution, whose identity or abundance is being sought, with a typically large number of probes fixed to the substrate. Target DNA molecules are prepared with fluorescent tags, the microarray is exposed to the resulting mixture under conditions that favour hybridisation, and any unbound DNA fragments are washed away. Microarray positions with DNA-DNA hybrids are then detected optically, indicating the components that were present in the starting sample. Each microarray experiment is therefore a large number of hybridisation experiments done in parallel and as such, microarrays can be thought of as 'highly parallel' processors of biological queries. Various microarray methods are available and differ in the type of the probe, the solid support and the methods used for addressing the probe and detecting the target (Miller & Tang, 2009 ). Microarray technologies commonly used for the detection and identification of microbial targets include solidstate microarrays, electronic microarrays and suspension bead microarrays. Details of these technologies, including probe length, number of possible features (or density) and surface chemistry employed, are described below and compared in Table 1 . In this chapter, we review the concepts behind each of these microarray technologies and describe clinical applications of microarray analysis for pathogen detection, genotyping and antimicrobial resistance testing in the microbiology laboratory.

The probes can be short oligonucleotides, cDNA or PCR products, and the surface attachment chemistry can be either covalent or non-covalent. Covalent attachment requires the addition of an aliphatic amine (NH 2 ) group to the 5 0 -end of the probe. The probes are then attached to the glass from their 5 0 -end. Non-covalent attachment involves electrostatic attraction between the amine groups on the glass slide and the phosphate group of the probe's backbone. Noncovalent interactions are not strong enough to tether short oligonucleotide probes to glass, thus non-covalent attachment is more appropriate for cDNA microarrays. The delivery of probes onto the glass slide is achieved with spotting robots using either contact or non-contact microarray printing. Contact printing technologies have been used since the early days of microarray technology. They are based on pin tools, which are dipped into the sample solution to take up a small volume of sample and then brought in contact with the slide surface to deliver the sample as a small spot. The currently available pins deliver spot volumes in 0.5-12 nl range, resulting in spot diameters from 62.5 to 600 mm.

For some pathogens such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis, phenotypic susceptibility testing can take days or weeks to complete, and empiric treatment must be initiated in the interim (Neonakis, Gitti, Krambovitis, & Spandidos, 2008; Schanne et al., 2008) . Often in bacterial infections, phenotypic susceptibility test results are available within 24-48 h, and the utilisation of microarray testing will depend on factors such as turnaround time, cost and the failure rate of empiric antibiotic coverage. It should be noted that the sensitivity may vary for species detection versus resistance markers, so that resistance prediction could be less reliable for organisms present in low titers (Thissen et al., 2014) .

Therefore, the spectrum of detection depends on both the number of available probes covering the desired species and the ability to amplify the regions of interest using conserved primers. No single target gene or genetic region will allow for detection of all pathogens of interest, so microarrays will typically target one or more classes of organisms. The most commonly used gene targets are listed in Table 2 , and include 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) (bacteria), internal transcribed spacers for 18S or 28S rDNA (fungi) and rpoB (mycobacteria) (Baker et al., 2003; Gingeras et al., 1998; McCabe et al., 1999) . Because it is not possible to design a primer pair that is completely conserved among all prokaryotic species for any gene target, PCR may be performed using degenerate primers or under conditions that allow for primer mismatches to still amplify the expected product. Therefore, species with lower sequence identity to primer regions can be identified, but require higher numbers of organisms for detection.
