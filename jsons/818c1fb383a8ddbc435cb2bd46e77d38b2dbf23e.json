In this paper, we propose NLPExplorer, a completely automatic portal for indexing, searching, and visualizing Natural Language Processing (NLP) research volume. NLPExplorer presents interesting insights from papers, authors, venues, and topics. In contrast to previous topic modelling based approaches, we manually curate five course-grained non-exclusive topical categories namely Linguistic Target (Syntax, Discourse, etc.), Tasks (Tagging, Summarization, etc.), Approaches (unsupervised, supervised, etc.), Languages (English, Chinese, etc.) and Dataset types (news, clinical notes, etc.). Some of the novel features include a list of young popular authors, popular URLs and datasets, list of topically diverse papers and recent popular papers. Also, it provides temporal statistics such as yearwise popularity of topics, datasets, and seminal papers. To facilitate future research and system development, we make all the processed dataset accessible through API calls. The current system is available at http://nlpexplorer.org.",

In particular, the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP ) witnessed the development of ACL Anthology since the year 2001, which curates papers (in PDF format) from more than 70 NLP venues M. Parmar, N. Jain, P. Jain, P. Jayakrishna Sahit and S. Pachpande-Alphabetically ordered with equal contribution including popular conferences like ACL, NAACL, EMNLP, etc. In the year 2008, Bird et al. [2] released the ACL Anthology Reference Corpus (ACL ARC), consisting of OCRed extracted text and metadata of PDF articles. In the year 2009, Radev et al. [8] developed ACL Anthology Network (AAN) by manually constructing paper citation, author citation and author collaboration network, along with other interesting statistics and citation summaries of the articles. The recently updated AAN system [9] indexes articles published till 2014. Another initiative, ACL Anthology SearchBench [10] , provides bibliographic metadata filtering and full-text structured semantic search in ACL Anthology. CL Scholar [12] periodically crawls ACL Anthology and constructs a computational linguistic knowledge graph. It supports natural language queries and entity specific queries about the authors, venue, and paper. Almost all systems described above are either in dormant condition [2, [8] [9] [10] or not available [12] .",

Additionally, we provide the list of popular recent authors, popular authors in the lifetime of ACL Anthology, authors with top publication counts, recent authors with high publication counts, and highly diverse authors. We make the list of topics and the processed data of the system available at the systems' webpage [6] . -Venue statistics: Venue-related statistics include temporal distribution of publications and citations, topical distribution, and the list of papers in a year. We also include insights such as the top NLP venues citing and cited by the candidate venue, popular authors publishing in the candidate venue, and the shift in topical distribution over the years. -URL statistics: We analyse URLs reported in the research papers. The URL-related statistics include top URLs in different categories such as universities, digital libraries, datasets and research groups, alongwith the analysis of top-level domains (TLDs) and corresponding sub-domains. Additionally, NLPExplorer provides year-wise usage distribution, total usage, and the list of top-most subdomains and associated papers.",

Even though, the current system supports NLP research domain, we claim that similar systems can be built for any domain given the availability of full text articles and basic metadata.",
