From the perspective of Weber's \"political fi nance,\" the peasants in the traditional society had to complete two tasks assigned by the state: taxes and corvee. As larger surplus could not be obtained from the small peasant economy, forced labor became an important way for the state to exploit the peasants. In addition, the small peasant economy shaped the governance model and structure of the traditional country: It was diffi cult for such a small surplus to support a complex state apparatus, thus impeding the expansion of state power, forming the political philosophy of \"no rule is the best rule\" 2 and a governance tradition of \"the emperor's reign stops at the county level,\" in addition to a dual governance pattern. Moreover, the emphasis on agriculture and the exclusion of commerce, or the orders of \"warning against luxury\" issued by various dynasties were all connected with the small peasant economy.",

As a result, \"if the ambitious imperial power had wanted to break new ground, built a river, it should have been regarded as an investment actually, just as what Roosevelt had done in the Tennessee Project, but it would be called tyranny in China.\" The result would be that \"cries of discontent arose all around, and protests against the imperial reign rose everywhere\" (See Fei Xiaotong 1985 ) .

Small peasant economy and small peasant society still played a dominant role in China, however, with China's crippled modern industry.

At the same time, constantly increasing efforts were paid to the collection and taxation of grain and other agricultural produce as provisions for the growing urban population to develop industry. In order to maintain a basic level of agricultural growth and the number of agricultural labor force during this process, the state strived to improve conditions and technology for agricultural production.

In addition, the fi nancial resources were extremely unreasonably distributed between the urban and the rural. The government's rural health budget expenditure from 1991 to 2000 was merely 69 billion yuan, accounting for only 15.9 % of total government health budget expenditure. Although there was an increase of 50.67 billion yuan in government health expenditure, only 6.008 billion yuan or 12.4 % of the increased sum was spent on rural areas during this period. 3 In the WTO assessment of the performance of national health systems of 191 WTO member countries in June 2000, it was found out that China ranked 188 (before Brazil, Myanmar, and Sierra Leone in the ranking) in terms of the \"fairness of fi nancial burden.\" On the other hand, as rural health care investment is largely fi nanced locally (the local government is responsible for the fi nance of the cities, counties, or villages, respectively, under its jurisdiction) since the introduction of the tax sharing system in 1994, there necessarily arose the divergence of health care investment among different places in terms of local health investment. Only 2 % of the local health expenditure is backed by the Central Government, whereas 55-60 % is fi nanced by the county governments or township governments. But the local sanitation investment fully rely on the local economic development and fi scal revenue, while they differ greatly from place to place (taking 1998, for example, gross product of Shanghai was 368.82 billion yuan, while in Ningxia the fi gure of 22.75 billion yuan was less than 10 % of that of Shanghai). What rural public health service can exploit from the local fi nancial resources is limited where the local fi scal revenue is limited. In some cases, the salaries of the health workers cannot be paid in such areas. If they were to survive under such circumstances, the health institutions would have no other choice than to resort to business income or income from selling drugs. As it was put by some people, we \"sell drugs to support medicine,\" to \"provide medical service with charge to support the health care center.\" According to a survey, 67 % of the county health funds come from business income, among which 51.2 % of the revenue comes from the outpatient department, 38 % from in-hospitalization, and 3.4 % from charged maternity and child-care service (Table 17 .1 ).",

In addition to the inadequacy of medical professionals, the low educational level of the health workers was also a problem. Among the 32,000 health care personnel in the township health care centers of Yunnan Province, only 9.5 % of them claim a medical college education. Among the 32,100 village health personnel, only 13 % of them have secondary education (Chen Huiyang and Tan Zhonggui 2003 Backward Equipment: According to an investigation by Jiangxi provincial health departments in 2000 on the 39 kinds of medical equipment in township health care centers as required by the \"Standards for Township Health Care Centers\" (formulated by the Ministry of Health in 1992), only 5 % of the township health care centers own birth process monitors and 7-25 % possess fi rst-aid equipment such as ventilators, gastric lavage machines, suctioning machines, tracheotomy packages, and phlebotomy packages. Over 50 % of the centers have equipment necessary in obstetrics and pediatrics, such as the fetal head extractor, abortion suction apparatus, gynecological examination bed, and neonatal weight meter. Although more than 70 % of the centers are equipped with X-ray machines, B ultrasonic machines, and high-pressure antiseptic equipment, they are generally very old, and 41, 35, and 57 % of them (respectively) could not operate normally. Many a township health care center still heavily relies on stethoscopes, sphygmomanometers, and thermometers to diagnose diseases. 5 Among the 1,526 township health care centers in 1,539 towns, and the 12,991 village health rooms of the 13,555 villages in Yunnan Province, 48 % have no housing, equipment, or personnel, and 7,011 of the village health rooms do not have a specifi c room to practice medicine (Chen Huiyang and Tan Zhonggui 2003 ) . Currently, 13.2 % have no blood pressure meter and 40.5 % do not have a sterilizer. 6 Such facilities proved inadequate once a public health crisis occurred. Prevention and treatment of SARS was a case in point. When the fi rst case of SARS was reported in Jingle County, Shanxi Province in early April 2003, it was discovered that there was no ambulance in the entire county. With a mobile surgical vehicle borrowed from the County Family Planning Commission, the patient was fi nally sent to Taiyuan to receive treatment. When the epidemic struck Chezhan Town (in Suiping County, Henan Province), the health care center there was on the verge of bankruptcy. Only with 50,000 yuan borrowed from all possible resources, and an X-ray machine borrowed from Suiping County Medical School, was a clinic for fever diagnosis, with the glass panels of the head offi ce all broken, able to be set up there. It shows the poor fundamental instrument which bring a lot of diffi cults for Rural Public Health Service.",

Under such requirements, to wear a gauze mask would be blamed by Mao Zedong, while \"the socialist neo-tradition\" imposed requirements of \"benevolence\" on the medical and health workers at another level; \"to serve the people wholeheartedly\" is a modern expression of being benevolent, while \"being selfl ess and serving others' interests only\" are the behavioral requirements. In combining modern politics and traditional thoughts, medical treatment became a \"benevolent\" means of saving the patients and saving the people.",

This is the fi rst step from the \"benevolent medicine\" toward \"formula for money-making.\" Then the market transcended the limitations imposed by time and space as well as boundaries among the walks of life, involving medicine in an exchange system with unparallel force. At this time, survival is of the utmost importance for the medical and health care departments, and growth is the fundamental requirement. Under such pressures of survival and growth, terms like cost accounting, input-output, and economic efficiency act as the inherent constraints of health care activities. Medicine was unable to retain its characteristic of \"benevolence\" and eventually became a \"formula for money-making.\"",

The state was responsible for the appropriation of all their funds (the majority of the funds were from the state fi nancial budget, although the actual business income may differ from one unit to another). Since the 1980s, however, the reform to the managerial system of the health care sector was carried out as effi ciency, and profi t-making became the general requirement or the goal model. The medical and health care sector turned corporate: \"High quality, high effi ciency, and low cost\" frequently appeared in the internal standard set by the medical and health care units. The state threatened to \"wean\" the appropriation of all or most of the funds, triggering the pressing survival crisis of the health sector. Yongfeng County People's Hospital can serve as a good example. In 2003, the constant fi scal appropriation decreased from 655,000 to 400,000 yuan. An average of 40,000 yuan each month and 480,000 yuan each year had to be spent on the 60 retired staff of the hospital if each had a salary of, say, 650 yuan. Then, how about the salaries of the 87 registered staff and 220 other staff? Such a dilemma forced the health care sector acclaim profi t-making as the highest standard.",

The purported cost accounting is, in turn, simplifi ed as such a rule: The unit must be responsible for and defray its patients' unpaid medical fees. Under such circumstances, how could the medical and health personnel help being \"cold-hearted killers\"? After all, a medical worker is just an ordinary human being who has to make a living. In addition, there are simply too many patients in poverty. The unpaid fees would likely swallow the annual revenue of the unit like an insatiable monster, if one was not careful. No wonder social ills frequently arise: \"No measures are taken (by the medical staff) to save the dying (for the medical fees have not been paid),\" or \"patients who cannot afford the medical fees are not welcomed.\" What has turned the \"angels in white\" into \"cold-hearted killers\"?",

So the total expense on mild and critically ill SARS patients was 23,000 and 67,000 yuan, respectively. What should we make of the fi gures? As Premier Wen Jiabao revealed to the reporters of Hong Kong Phoenix TV at the Press Conference after the Tenth National People's Congress in March 2003, \"In China, 900 million of the 1.3 billion people are peasants. Among them, 30 million peasants have not been upgraded above the poverty line according to the standard of 625 yuan annual per capita income.\" \"If the standard of 825 yuan is used, then the number of the peasants below the poverty line is 90 million.\" Using Wen's statistics, and assuming that these poor peasants must fi nance their own medical treatments, we will discover that, if the patient were a critically ill SARS patient, even if he has been working from 18 to 68 years old and does not spend a penny on anything, he would still be 27,000 short: 67,000 yuan \u2212 (800 yuan \u00d7 50 years) = 27,000 yuan. That is to say, if a peasant became a critically ill SARS patient, he would have to work until he was 103 years old to pay off his medical fees. As a matter of fact, 170,000 yuan (excluding human capital) was spent on the case of imported SARS in Jiangxi Province. No wonder peasants were severely frightened and resorted to fleeing the area when SARS struck (Xu Yong 2003 ) . Fortunately, the state exerted all its powers under the guideline that \"nothing should be left undone to control the epidemic.\" Faced with the epidemic of SARS, Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Health Gao Qiang announced on April 20, 2003 that \"medical fee subsidy system should be implemented for the urban SARS patients in economic diffi culties and all the peasant patients.\" Three days later, two billion yuan was allocated by the Central Government for the founding of a SARS Prevention Fund. On April 29, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Health issued a document, in which it was prescribed that free treatment be provided for those urban SARS patients in economic diffi culties and peasant patients, and all the costs be reimbursed by the government. On May 1, the Ministry of Health, Ministry of Finance, Labor and Social Security Ministry, and Ministry of Civil Affairs jointly issued \"Notice about the Medical Expenses of Atypical Pneumonia Patients and Suspected SARS Patients,\" emphasizing the principle of \"treatment fi rst, fees later.\" All patients with fever will receive treatment and be hospitalized with neither registration fee nor deposit (prepayment); all the peasants and the poor people in the cities belonged to this category. Only with such state arrangement was the escape of the frantic peasants prevented and conditions conducive to the triumph over the spreading of SARS were created.",

This means the expenses were 260 yuan/ mu and 1,092 yuan in total. Together with 180 yuan/ mu for taxation and money set aside (for the collective), the expenses were 1,848 yuan; (3) Net income: 2,709 \u2212 1,848 = 861 yuan. That is to say, the annual net income is not able to fi nance one case of hospitalization. While from 1990 to 1999, the annual income per capita increased 2.2 times, or from 686.31 yuan to 2,210.34 yuan, 8 the outpatient charge and hospitalization fee increased 6.2 times (from 10.9 yuan to 79 yuan) and 5.1 times (from 473.3 yuan to 2,891 yuan), respectively. 9 While surplus in cash form was too small, the expenses of medical treatments were massive. Consequently, it was diffi cult for the peasants engaging in agriculture to bear the expenses of medical treatment. In addition, agriculture follows a natural cycle and investment has to be made periodically; however, when they are paid, the peasants hardly ever paid in cash. As a result, a peasant does not usually have a lot of cash at hand. Thus, for the diseases that are not very serious, the peasants would just delay seeing a doctor until they felt too weak to pull through. In the end, they will turn to any medical resources. As mentioned by a survey in Anhui, Hunan, Yunnan, and Sichuan Provinces by researchers from Peking University in 2001 and 2002, 48 .65 % of the peasant families had members who contracted a disease for 2 weeks; 81.25 % of the sick peasants failed to resort to medical resources, among whom half of the patients did not seek medical help because of fi nancial reasons. According to the \"Report on the Statistics of the Development of the Health Care Service of 2001\" released by the Statistics Center of the Ministry of Health, the expense for each hospitalization was 3,245.5 yuan in 2001. In another survey of the Ministry of Health, it was discovered that the rate of the people in poverty-stricken areas who failed to avail themselves of medical resources for economic reasons increased from 55.9 % in 1985 to 67.7 % in 1993 (State Planning Commission 1999 .",

In consequence, incidences of chronic diseases and incurable diseases are increasing. Liver cancer and lung cancer are contracted by a growing number of people in some villages, where such cases have never occurred before. Generally speaking, if it were the main laborer who suffers from a serious illness, every effort would be paid to save his life until their fi nancial resources are depleted. Medical treatment will sometimes come to a halt, unfortunately, if funds cannot be raised timely. When resources are exhausted, the patient's family has no choice but to simply buy painkillers to ease the patient's sufferings. Unable to bear the torture of the illness and when there seems to be no way out, some patients simply commit suicide to avoid being a burden to the family. The elderly people with chronic diseases, on the other hand, are usually the last ones to receive medical treatment, being generally marginalized for their lack of labor force. Exceptions to the rule will occur unless it is in an area where the clan tradition still remains. During the author's investigation, many cases of sick elderly peasants who had a hard time enduring the sufferings infl icted by their illnesses, with neither timely treatment nor long-term treatment, were found. Therefore, the encounter between the small peasant economy and the market would likely result in the phenomenon of the peasants' having \"enough to eat, but not enough to pay in cash.\" Their requirements for development can barely be satisfi ed, and they are increasingly at risk. The rupture of the rural health network only further deprived the peasants of protection against the diseases. In the shifting tide of secularization and in its battle for survival, the originally benevolent medicine has turned into \"formula for money-making.\" When dangers lurk in reality, the peasants' chances of averting it are small. There is no way for them to acquire some relief. When diseases like plagues appear on the horizon, the peasants have to either fl ee, or delay, or await medical treatment. They are fearful, helpless, or even in despair. The Chinese peasants are in a risk society, to say the least.",
