For example, budgetary allocations to key sectors such as health and education through its positive effects can enhance equity and reduce poverty (Gupta et al. 2001) . Budgetary allocations to public sectors are classified into capital expenditure and recurrent expenditure. Capital expenditure can be classified as a payment for non-financial assets used in the production process while recurrent expenditure is payment for non-repayable transactions within one year. Gupta et al. (1998) suggested that public spending on health and education through its positive effects on the formation of human capital can boost economic development and reduce poverty. This is achieved through reduction and eradication of diseases and improvement in the health of the populace. The need for an instant and substantial intervention from the government given any disease outbreak especially communicable disease is likely to divert public spending from investment in development projects to health and other social spending. Foreign and domestic private investments may also decline without government support to the investors (ECA 2014a, b, c, d) . For example, the 2014 Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) report on Ebola crisis in Africa showed that EVD decreased public revenue and increased expenditure in health. This creates pressure on the fiscal stability and weakened state's capacity to manage the disease or protect the economy against spill over effects of the outbreak. Fiscal imbalance due to the outbreak may also force the country to depend on external support. ECA (2014a, b, c, d) argued that health crisis due to the epidemic may lead to a large health spending to manage the disease and provide social protection as a result of the number of deaths, increase in the number of orphans and number of poor. These unfavourable changes in revenue and expenditures of government may force a reallocation of resources in favour of the new needs against productive public investment.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 256, "end": 275, "text": "(Gupta et al. 2001)", "ref_id": "BIBREF22"}, {"start": 579, "end": 598, "text": "Gupta et al.

A reasonable conclusion therefore is that epidemic diseases will hinder economic growth which may further negatively affect government revenue and spending. Despite many studies on the Ebola-welfare transmission mechanism, the dwindling government revenue of the affected countries due to the outbreak of Ebola disease makes investigation of the impact of the Ebola disease on the government expenditures of the affected country vital. Studies have attempted to study the cost of the EVD on the health sector and health workers of the countries affected, as well as on individuals and households of these countries but very little or nothing has been done on the impact of the disease on government expenditure of these countries especially on the Sierra Leonean economy.

One major distinction between low-and high-income countries regarding health challenges, is that, while individuals in high-income countries suffer mostly from non-communicable diseases (e.g. stroke, cancer, heart attack), health systems in developing countries are used to finance the burden of communicable and infectious diseases such as Ebola and tuberculosis (Hsiao and Heller 2007) .", "cite_spans": [{"start": 419, "end": 441, "text": "(Gerdtham et al. 1992)", "ref_id": "BIBREF17"}, {"start": 808, "end": 831, "text": "(Hsiao and Heller 2007)", "ref_id": "BIBREF25"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Empirical Review"}, {"text": "In a study on the impact of epidemic outbreak on consumer expenditures for Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS) in South Korea, Hojin et al. (2016) found that the South Korean government was forced to cut the country's economic growth forecast for 2015 to 3.1%, a drop from the projected 3.8% in 2014. This was due to the government's inability to effectively control MERS. Consequently, and compared to the previous year, retail shops in South Korea faced a 3.4% decrease in sales, and department stores also experienced a 16.5% decrease in sales. The authors further asserted that the outbreak led to over 100,000 cancelled tourist visits to South Korea. As a result, a stimulus package of over $13.5 billion and a 0.25-percentage-point cut in interest rates was offered by the government to reduce the adverse economic effects of the outbreak. This stimulus package was a re-direction of government spending from productive sector to reduce the effects of the epidemic. Thompson et al. (2003) on the economic costs of the foot and mouth disease (FMD) outbreak in the United Kingdom in 2001 shows that the losses to agriculture and the food chainamount to about \u00a33.1 billion. Government incurred the majority of these costs through compensation for slaughter and disposal and clean-up costs which adversely affects government spending on productive investment. The surveys of tourism shows that tourist-related businesses lost about \u00a32.7-3.2 billion due to reduced number of tourists. However, the overall costs to the UK economy are substantially less than the sum of these components. Much of what was gotten from tourists expenditure was moved to other sectors of the economy.

Piot, (2014) observed that healthcare workers were principally vulnerable to contracting the disease. This led to an increase in non-Ebola related mortality (ACAPS 2014; Piot 2014) . Also, about 80% HIV/AIDS positive individuals living in the three most affected countries were unable to access treatment and pregnantwomen stopped giving birth in health facilities (ACAPS 2014; Glassman and Raghavan 2014).

Health and burial workers also went on strike over hazard payment and in some cases no payment (ACAPS 2014). Thus, there was a general reversal of the gains made in the health sector in relation to child mortality, maternal mortality, HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other dis-eases as a result of the closure of health services and the diversion of resources to combatting Ebola (Glassman and Raghavan 2014) . The EVD epidemic also had a devastating socio-economic impact in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone beside the adverse health effects. The disease resulted in low investment and a large loss in private sector growth and declining agricultural production, and a decrease in crossborder trade due to increased restrictions on movement of goods and services.

All these costs are incurred or increased by the pressing need to sustain a free environment, implement better preventive measures and carry out research that can help curb the disease. tion and labour force. Lee and McKibbin, (2004) argued the destruction of human capital is another transmission mechanism through which disease outbreak adversely affects the economy's long-term growth. However, in term of private costs and public spending, the direct consequences of the Ebola epidemic are high and have detrimental effects on productive sectors. Ebola influences the Sierra Leone economy in major three ways. First, fear of Ebola leads to a considerable decline in consumer demand, especially for travel since the fast rate of contagion makes people avoid social interactions. The decrease in consumption has a more detrimental effect on regions with more service industries and higher population densities and this negatively affects not only the revenue generation capacity of the government but also compel an inevitable diversion of public expenditure from productive industry and human capital development to Ebola epidemic. Second, uncertainty concerning any future epidemics reduces confidence in the future and this effect is very important for a developing country like Sierra Leone which required foreign investment for growth and development. Third, Ebola unquestionably increases the cost of disease prevention, especially in the most affected industries, such as travel, retail and the service industries. The Government of Sierra Leone introduced the declaration of a State of Emergency and special security powers to separate the affected areas, place restrictions on internal movement, close markets and schools and reduce public gatherings among others as measures to control the epidemic. These measures had profound effects on people. The quarantine and other restrictions of movement had a noticeable effect on economic activity, including foregone output, higher fiscal deficits, rising consumer prices, depreciation of the national currency, loss of employment and increased levels of poverty. The agricultural sector also suffered significant declines in production and disruptions in the planting cycle with far reaching effect on household food security which may take several years to recover.

But given an outbreak of a deadly communicable disease, all these expenditures may be absent. The exposition of work on endogenous growth has generated a number of models linking public spending with economic growth. A particular simple version is Barro's (1990) , which takes government expenditure to be complementary with production. This framework assumes that all components of public expenditure are productive. This study considers a modification of simple model of endogenous growth assuming that the government imposes a proportional income tax rate and instead of using the public budget to furnish both households with public consumption and firms with productive investments, uses public budget to contain disease outbreak.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 691, "end": 705, "text": "Barro's (1990)", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Theoretical Framework and Methodology"}, {"text": "Given the modification of the endogenous growth model, the functional form of the model for this study is expressed as follows: \u00b5 (6.4) Equation (6.4) measures the impact of EVD and other variables as defined above on government capital expenditure in Sierra Leone.

However, the speed of this pre-shock adjustment depends on ECM result. Table 6 .4 shows the ECM estimates for the short-run and long-run movements and the speed of adjustment. From the table, EVD has negative effect on GCE in the short-run and this is statistically significant at 5% level. This suggests that EVD negatively affects GCE in the short-term in Sierra Leone. Table 6 .4 further shows the long-run relationship between GCE and EVD. The equilibrium adjustment coefficient (\u22120.8044) shows the correct sign (negative). This suggests that GCE and EVD converge to long-run equilibrium and deviations from this equilibrium relationship as a result of shocks will be corrected over time. It can also be observed that \u03b1 2 tends to one, indicating that the speed of adjustment to equilibrium is fast. It follows that about 80% of the deviation from equilibrium path is corrected Table 6 .5 further shows that the coefficient of EVD conforms to our apriori expectation. It shows that EVD impacted negatively on government capital expenditure and hence on growth. The transmission mechanism involves the redirection of government capital expenditures which are supposed to be spent on investment and infrastructural facilities to containing the spread of the disease and treating the infected individuals. More so, much of the foreign assistance to the country will also be targeted at attacking the epidemic rather than economic growth and development. These will conspicuously have a dampening effect on growth in Sierra Leone. Therefore, EVD or outbreak of any communicable disease will affect government capital expenditure negatively and by implication dampen the economic growth of any affected country. Also, population growth and life expectancy are directly related to government capital expenditure. This also implies that both can aid growth of the economy with an increase in capital expenditure.

As highlighted earlier, the disease did not only infected and killed people in this country, but had the greater impact of affecting the economic situation of the country leading to a deficit in government budget of about 3.1%. This study examined the impact of EVD on government capital expenditure in Sierra Leone. This is important for the implication of disease outbreak on economic growth. The study shows that EVD impacted negatively on government capital expenditure, hence economic growth. EVD impacted negatively on growth due to diversion of government spending on curtailing the spread of the disease, treating the affected individuals and caring for the orphans and widows who lost their parents and husbands due to the outbreak of the disease. Equally, the restriction of movement of people to and from affected zones also led to many more people not being able to work and thus leading to a decline in productivity and growth. Minimizing the impact of communicable diseases vs reducing their occurrence is to prioritize investment in human capital development through e.g. education for all, water and sanitation for all, settings approaches (healthy cities, Health promoting schools, health promoting hospitals, health promoting working places and markets), etc. Emergency funds also needs to be created to spend on possible future occurrence of this nature, so as to prevent spending funds meant for growth on containing outbreak of diseases. Finally, since economic growth and development are the main objectives of public expenditure, issues of growth policy should emphasize quality and adequate levels of investment in social and economic infrastructure.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusion"}], "bib_entries": {"BIBREF0": {"ref_id": "b0", "title": "Ebola outbreak in West Africa: Update (Briefing note -26", "authors": [{"first": "Acaps", "middle": [], "last": "", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2014, "venue": "ACAPS Retrieved", "volume": "", "issn": "", "pages": "", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF1": {"ref_id": "b1", "title": "Government expenditure and economic growth in Nigeria: A disaggregated approach", "authors": [{"first": "N", "middle": ["I"], "last": "Akpan", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2005, "venue": "CBN Economic and Financial Review", "volume": "43", "issn": "1", "pages": "51--69", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF2": {"ref_id": "b2", "title": "Public expenditure and economic growth in Africa", "authors": [{"first": "O", "middle": [], "last": "Aregbeyen", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2006, "venue": "Nigerian Journal of Economic and Social Studies", "volume": "", "issn": "160", "pages": "", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF3": {"ref_id": "b3", "title": "Government spending in a simple model of endogenous growth", "authors": [{"first": "R", "middle": [], "last": "Barro", "suffix": ""}], "year": 1990, "venue": "Journal of Political Economy", "volume": "98", "issn": "5", "pages": "103--125", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF4": {"ref_id": "b4", "title": "Escaping high mortality", "authors": [{"first": "J", "middle": ["A"], "last": "Birchenall", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2007, "venue": "Journal of Economic Growth", "volume": "12", "issn": "", "pages": "351--387", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF5": {"ref_id": "b5", "title": "The political economy of AIDS leadership in developing countries: An exploratory analysis", "authors": [{"first": "J", "middle": [], "last": "Bor", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2007, "venue": "Social Science & Medicine", "volume": "64", "issn": "", "pages": "1585--1599", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF6": {"ref_id": "b6", "title": "Techniques for testing the constancy of 442 regression relations over time", "authors": [{"first": "R", "middle": ["L"], "last": "Brown", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "J", "middle": [], "last": "Durbin", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "J", "middle": ["M"], "last": "Evans", "suffix": ""}], "year": 1975, "venue": "Journal of the Royal Statistical Society", "volume": "37", "issn": "", "pages": "149--192", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF7": {"ref_id": "b7", "title": "Health sector reform: Key issues in less developed countries", "authors": [{"first": "A", "middle": [], "last": "Cassels", "suffix": ""}], "year": 1995, "venue": "Journal of International Development", "volume": "7", "issn": "3", "pages": "329--347", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF8": {"ref_id": "b8", "title": "Public spending on health care in Africa: Do the poor benefit?", "authors": [{"first": "F", "middle": [], "last": "Castro-Leal", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "J", "middle": [], "last": "Dayton", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "L", "middle": [], "last": "Demery", "suffix": ""}, {"first": "K", "middle": [], "last": "Mehra", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2000, "venue": "Bulletin of the World Health Organization", "volume": "78", "issn": "1", "pages": "66--74", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF9": {"ref_id": "b9", "title": "Macroeconomics and health: Investing in health for economic development", "authors": [{"first": "", "middle": [], "last": "Cdc", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2002, "venue": "Report of the Commission on Macroeconomics and Health to the World Health Organization", "volume": "", "issn": "", "pages": "", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF10": {"ref_id": "b10", "title": "Three lessons from the Ebola crisis for Sierra Leone's government and investors", "authors": [{"first": "M", "middle": [], "last": "Curtis", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2015, "venue": "Policy Brief for the Budget Advocacy Network", "volume": "", "issn": "", "pages": "", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF11": {"ref_id": "b11", "title": "Rapport de mission de l'\u00c9quipe de la CEA en Guin\u00e9e", "authors": [{"first": "", "middle": [], "last": "Eca", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2014, "venue": "", "volume": "", "issn": "", "pages": "", "other_ids": {}}, "BIBREF12": {"ref_id": "b12", "title": "Report of the ECA team mission to Sierra Leone", "authors": [{"first": "", "middle": [], "last": "Eca", "suffix": ""}], "year": 2014, "venue": "Addis Ababa.
