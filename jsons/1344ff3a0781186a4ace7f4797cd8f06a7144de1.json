The significant relationship between the breed of the cat and the FCoV antibody titre further supports the notion, proposed previously by the authors, that breed related differences exist in the immunological response to FCoV infection. Aust Vet J 2006;84:74-81 H istorically, there is substantial evidence that serological studies of FCoV infection provide important epidemiological insights. The first serological study of FCoV by Pedersen in 1976 1 identified a significantly higher rate of seroconversion to what was thought at the time to be FIPV, than the incidence of FIP within a population of cats in northern California. Subsequent studies by other researchers report similar findings. 2, 3 It was proposed that FIP is an uncommon outcome of infection with a ubiquitous virus that causes only mild disease in the majority of cats. However, this theory appears to contradict results from experimental FIPV inoculation studies, which clearly demonstrate that the majority of cats infected developed rapidly fatal FIP. The apparent discrepancy in viral pathogenesis between natural and experimental infections prompted further investigation of the virus responsible for seroconversion of the majority of naturally infected cats that do not succumb to FIP. The eventual outcome of these efforts was the hypothesis that FIP occurred as the result of spontaneous mutation of FCoV during the course of infection -a theory that revolutionised our understanding of FIP pathogenesis. 4 The potential of FCoV serological studies to provide valuable epidemiological information is well recognised and reflected in the considerable number of serosurveys of feline populations which have been, and are continuing to be, conducted in many countries around the world.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 899, "end": 901, "text": "2,", "ref_id": "BIBREF1"}, {"start": 902, "end": 903, "text": "3", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}, {"start": 1687, "end": 1688, "text": "4", "ref_id": "BIBREF3"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Conclusion"}, {"text": "While FCoV serology is unable to predict which cats will go on to develop FIP, it is generally accepted that the magnitude of the FCoV antibody titre is a reflection of recent viral load.

Comparing the prevalence and magnitude of FCoV antibody titres within and between various feline populations may identify such factors.

However, two recent studies have challenged this fundamental hypothesis.

Findings from seroprevalence studies conducted overseas are not directly transferable to Australia, as the geographic variation in estimates of FCoV seroprevalence overseas has been marked, ranging from 9% to 84%. 3, 11 In addition to this, the prevalence of other viral infections in Australian cats is significantly different from cats in the UK and North America, the two areas from which the majority of FCoV seroprevalence data has been derived. These differences in seroprevalence may be indicative of the presence of strains of different virulence and infectivity in Australia (perhaps facilitated by our geographical isolation), and/or inherent differences in the Australian cat population attributable to variations in genetic constitution, husbandry and management of cats. Similar factors are likely to be also applicable when considering the seroprevalence of FCoV infections in Australia, as (i) the high rate of mutation results in many different strains of FCoV that may vary in virulence; 12, 13 (ii) there is an important genetic component to FIP susceptibility; 14 and (iii) transmission of FCoV is heavily influenced by the environment and management. 6, 15, 16 These observations illustrate that we cannot simply assume that overseas estimates of seroprevalence are comparable to our own and there is therefore a need to investigate FCoV infections in the unique Australian environment.

The most novel finding was the highly significant association between breed and FCoV Immunocomb \u00ae score in owned cats. Previous published studies 6, 9, 10 have recognised a lower seroprevalence in domestic than in purebred cats. Our analysis extended to a variety of purebred cats and detected a conspicuous distinction between breeds that has not been reported previously. The significantly lower median Immunocomb \u00ae score of DSH, Persian, Siamese and Devon Rex cats compared with that of Burmese, BSH, Ragdoll, Russian Blue, Birman and Abyssinian cats supports the theory that there are true breed differences in susceptibility to FCoV infection that cannot be attributed simply to a population-dense cattery background facilitating FCoV transmission. This study supports and extends the findings of a retrospective study by the authors and opens the door to investigations into breed related variation in FCoV susceptibility and immune responsiveness. The overall seroprevalence of FCoV infection in our client-owned cat population was 34%. This is higher than previously published estimates of seroprevalence for overseas owned cat populations, the majority of which approximate 20 to 25%. 1, 2, 4, 9, 10 However, the careful construction of the sample population and the total of 306 cats sampled (sufficient to estimate prevalence of 34% with allowable error of 5% and level of confidence of 95%) in this study ensured that results were likely to reflect the true seroprevalence in the target owned cat hospital population of inner city Sydney from which tested cats were sourced. This study design distinguishes the present work from many previously published surveys of FCoV seroprevalence, which were either less selective in composing their sample population, or merely sampled a 'convenience' population without first establishing selection criteria. The Immunocomb \u00ae FCoV antibody test kit was selected for use in this study for two reasons: i) the favourable correlation with the gold standard test (IFAT) 22 and ii) the ease of application. The suggested interpretation of serological results provided by the manufacturer was modified, based on Addie's 21 findings when evaluating this and other tests in comparison with IFAT. 22 Using these modifications, Addie concluded that the Immunocomb \u00ae compared favourably with the IFAT, with a sensitivity of 95% and a specificity of 83%. 22 Using the modified interpretations, cats with scores of 1 and 2 were considered seronegative, although the presence of low levels of antibodies in these cats was indicative of previous exposure to FCoV. Had these scores been considered positive, 79% of the owned cat population would have had serological evidence of previous exposure to FCoV. Whether the true seroprevalence of FCoV infection in our sample population is 34% or 79%, this observation further illustrates that the vast majority of FCoV infections do not give rise to FIP. The seroprevalence of FCoV infection in single cat households was significantly lower than in multiple cat households, consistent with other seroprevalence studies. 6, 10, 23 It is likely that this reflects facilitated transmission of faecal-oral pathogens such as FCoV within environments where multiple cats use the same litter tray. FCoVs are highly contagious, and within groups of cats it has been demonstrated that almost 100% of susceptible individuals will become infected following exposure. 16, 24 Importantly, previous FCoV infection does not impart protection from reinfection. When the improbability of exactly synchronising infections and time of shedding periods between cats in a household is also considered, the likelihood of continual re-infection of cats housed together is obvious.

The discrepancy between these results and those of the present project may be attributable to significant environmental differ-ences between Australia and the UK. The Australian climate is considerably warmer and drier than in the UK, and these harsher conditions may inactivate FCoV in the environment more rapidly, decreasing the length of the infectious period for cats with access to the outdoors. Another possibility is that the population density may have been lower in the present study, decreasing the potential for faeco-oral transmission.

As the reported specificity of the Immunocomb \u00ae test is 83%, 22 it was unlikely that all these results were false positives; rather, it is probable that some proportion of these cats had low circulating antibody levels. Thus it is likely that these cats had been exposed previously to the virus. The negligible seroprevalence was therefore not a function of absence of exposure but rather attributable to reduced or absent viral loads. By defecating outside over a considerable territory, with adequate burial of the stool by soil, the likelihood of exposure of feral cats to the faeces of other cats, and repeated exposure to their own faeces, is reduced. Consequently, the risk of continual re-infection is decreased, with a corresponding reduction in viral load and more likely eventual elimination of infection. The discordance between our results and those of Muirden 9 may, alternatively, reflect a difference in lifestyle of feral cat populations between the two countries. The colder UK climate may encourage colonies of cats to cluster together in warm niches.
