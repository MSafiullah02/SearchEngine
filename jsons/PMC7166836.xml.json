There is no defined geographical location (a \u201cGround Zero\u201d) or policy sector around which to organize. That creates diversity in perspective: What in one domain is experienced as a problem of scarcity may become a matter of public safety in another; what in one country is considered a local matter is Chefsache in another country.\nIncubation and rapid escalation: The Transboundary Crisis is characterized by periods of slow, often imperceptible development and phases of rapid escalation. Europe's immigration crisis, for instance, attracted little attention for years. The escalation came seemingly out of nowhere when thousands of people drowned in the Mediterranean, and refugee flows reached the coasts of Greek and Italian islands.\nHard to chart: The root causes of a crisis that originated in another country or sector are difficult to comprehend. Causes are unclear, possible consequences seem uncertain, and escalation is unpredictable. When it is all over and the report on the crisis is written, it may become clear what happened (and how it could have been avoided). But during the crisis, it is extremely difficult to establish the most basic developments. The Transboundary Crisis brings rude surprises.\nMultiple actors, conflicting responsibilities: The Transboundary Crisis does not fall neatly into a defined domain, with a clear division of tasks and responsibilities. The Transboundary Crisis challenges multiple actors with various responsibilities. It is not clear which actor is responsible for what or who has the capacities to perform certain tasks. The Transboundary Crisis blurs the organizational boundaries that normally facilitate an effective response.\nNo ready\u2010made solutions: For most policy issues, possible solutions exist. They may be controversial or taken for granted. But it is usually clear what the discussion is or should be about. The Transboundary Crisis defies easy or conventional solutions. And what works here may not work there. Consider the cyber domain: It is rarely clear who or what is behind a cyber disruption; it is often even less clear who can do what to protect a critical system against a cyber attack.\n",

It may well turn out that some types of Transboundary Crises are more amenable to certain interventions (such as centralization and coordination, decoupling or resilience) than others. It may well be that certain types are more politically or analytically challenging. The research challenge is to find out how characteristics relate to preparatory and management efforts. We may discover that certain types are intractable, whereas others may lend themselves to early detection and intervention. By studying cases of actual crises and near misses, we should be able to enhance our understanding of the Transboundary Crisis.",
