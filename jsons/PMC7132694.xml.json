Moreover, not all outbreak descriptions are available in MEDLINE; indeed, only a small proportion of outbreaks have been published in the medical literature. Reasons for this include that some outbreaks were not considered worthy of publication, the number of involved patients was considered too small, or potential authors feared negative consequences for their own hospitals from reporting an epidemic event.
