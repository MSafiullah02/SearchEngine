Half of the World's population is exposed to this disease caused by a protozoan, Plasmodium, and transmitted by the female Anopheles mosquito. The clinical phase in human infection corresponds to the invasion of red blood cells (RBC) by the merozo\u00efte form of the parasite; this follows a first phase of development of the sporozo\u00efte in the liver after its injection by Anopheles. In the RBC, the parasite develops into a trophozo\u00efte that internalizes and digests its host cell content, it then differentiates into schizont containing multiple merozo\u00eftes which will invade new RBC. Two forms of malaria have a particularly severe prognostic: (1) cerebral malaria (mainly in young children), due to sequestration of mature parasites in the brain, the consequence of adherence of parasitized RBC to endothelium of cerebral capillary vessels, and (2) malaria occurring in pregnant women, due to mass sequestration of infected erythrocytes in placenta.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 60, "end": 63, "text": "[1]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Malaria: The Burden and the Problems"}, {"text": "Among the five species currently recognized to infect humans, Plasmodium falciparum is the most deadly (the others being P. vivax, P. malariae, P. ovale, and P. knowlesi). Among 2.37 billion people are exposed across 87 countries, malaria is the cause of 300-500 million clinical cases per year [2], but even though falciparum malaria is rife in nearly all tropical and subtropical areas of the World, Africa is currently the worst affected, accumulating (WHO 2004 statistics) 70% of total malaria clinical episodes which are the cause of 7% of the total number of deaths, 20% of direct child mortality (one child dies of malaria every 30 s) [3] , 10% of indirect child mortality [4] , and a severe prognosis for mothers and children when infection occurs during the first pregnancy [5, 6] . Of these fatal outcomes, malaria is the cause of many sequelae in the surviving patients, mainly in young children [5] , and disability in adults during infectious episodes. The malaria burden, expressed as DALYs (disability-adjusted life year), was ranked fourth out of all diseases for low-income countries in 2004, behind lower respiratory infections, diarrheal diseases, and AIDS [7] . Other heavy consequences of malaria include anemia that can increase child mortality and can markedly reduce power productivity in adults and a deficit in intellectual developments, which has consequences on the future evolution of development and productivity in concerned areas [8] . In lower income countries, malaria can represent 1-3% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita. As a result, malaria is a poverty impeding factor in developing countries that are affected by this disease [8] . To face such a challenge, the international financing was increased. The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria (GFTAM) and other supports committed US$ 991.5 million for malaria in 2007. However, among the 136 countries supported by this strategy since 2002, 16 of them, representing 710 million people living in stable transmission conditions, received an estimated combined annual support lower than US$ 0.5 per capita [9] , which is not enough to fight efficiently malaria.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 642, "end": 645, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 680, "end": 683, "text": "[4]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 783, "end": 786, "text": "[5,", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 787, "end": 789, "text": "6]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 907, "end": 910, "text": "[5]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1176, "end": 1179, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1462, "end": 1465, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1674, "end": 1677, "text": "[8]", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 2115, "end": 2118, "text": "[9]", "ref_id": null}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Malaria: The Burden and the Problems"}, {"text": "Vaccination, which would theoretically represent the best way to settle the problem of malaria, remains very far despite the large amount of money devoted to this research area in the last 40 years and the numbers of papers published, even if protection against malaria appears possible, based on the sum of observations collected.

However, the cost of these interventions is very high, representing up to 30% of domestic expenses in low-income countries and must be supported in a large part by international interventions (Multilateral Initiative on Malaria, Roll Back Malaria Project, GFTAM, Medicines for Malaria Venture), which have played an important role in the progress observed so far. Resistance, which spread both in Anopheles and Plasmodium, disproved the efficacy of the global fight program because low cost insecticides and drugs, the most interesting for concerned populations, are less and less efficient. For some insecticides as DDT, economical interests of concurrent products and environmental problems are adding to mosquito resistance problems. As a consequence, eradication programs were abandoned in the 1970s.

The cytostome is an invagination of both parasite and parasitophorous membranes [23] . Currently, there is an active discussion about the role of actin in the formation of this structure [21, 23] . This is due to recent evidence of rab5, a marker associated with endosome formation and transport in eukaryotes [21] . Cytostomes are formed throughout the erythrocytic cell cycle and often many are found in one parasite. Subsequent individualization of small vesicules containing Hb was observed by numerous authors [20] [21] [22] 24] . These vesicules appear at the ring stage [20] but their importance in Hb uptake becomes more important at the trophozo\u00efte stage [21] . They are transported to the digestive vacuole and finally fuse with it. This process is actin and rab5-dependent. Digestion occurs in these structures because hemozoin can appear in them even if their fusion with the digestive vacuole is inhibited, indicating that they can acquire the necessary enzymes and factors to degrade Hb and to biocrystallize hematin [21, 24] . A cytostomal tube can be produced by the parasite, starting from a cytostome by elongation of small vesicles described above. Its formation requires actin intervention [21, 23] . Cytostomal tubes were thought to have an important role in Hb uptake by the parasite. Individual digestive vesicles were proposed to either bud off from the terminal portion of the tube or by the individualization of the different portions of the tube itself. Finally, the pigment vesicles were proposed to fuse rapidly to produce a \"residual vacuole,\" where malarial pigment was supposed to be sequestrated [24] . Recent observations suggest a direct fuse of cytostomal tube with the food vacuole resulting from the evolution of the \"big gulp\" and not by individualization of vesicles [23] , but these results are controversial [21] .

Four aspartic proteases (falcipains), three cysteic proteases (plasmepsins), a metalloprotease (falcilysin), a dipeptidylpeptidase I, and probably aminopeptidases are involved in the digestion of Hb [25] . Hb is primarily attacked by plasmepsins and falcipains and cleaved into smaller fragments. These fragments are hydrolyzed by falcilysin in small peptides, and finally aminoacids were liberated by dipeptidylpeptidase and aminopeptidase. Inhibitors of the falcipain and plasmepsins impair or kill the parasite in vitro and in vivo, but their specificity is not strict. Knockouts experiments on several of these enzymes, individually or in combination, demonstrated that in normal culture conditions P. falciparum is able to acquire the important parts of the aminoacids necessary from its environmental medium (isoleucine, which is absent in Hb is entirely taken up from parasitized RBC outside compartment) as a redundant way with Hb degradation. Such experiments also showed that some proteolytic enzymes have an overlapping role in Hb digestion and, for these reasons, plasmepsins do not represent valuable drug targets [26] . It must be noted that if Hb degradation is strictly necessary for parasite survival [26] , it is not restricted to the use of produced amino acids for nutrition, but also to make room for itself [16, 19] and to maintain the osmotic pressure required to avoid lysis of the infected RBC [16, 17] .

There is now clear evidence that the formation of hemozoin occurs in a hydrophobic environment within or at the surface of lipids in Plasmodium and in other organisms producing hemozoin [40] [41] [42] .

This preliminary data incited us to explore in vivo activity of FQ on murine malaria models. Subcutaneous administration of FQ to mice infected by P. berghei N, according to the \"four-days blood schizonticidal test\" [138] , showed that drug IC 50 and IC 90 values were, respectively, 1.22 and 1.95 mg/kg/day as against 1.39 and 2.7 mg/kg/day for CQ [129] .

The strain was able to develop only in immature erythrocytes and maximum parasitemia was about 2%. Mice were very often able to cure themselves from parasites, either under pressure of FQ or in absence of drug.

Just removing drug pressure resulted in a rapid loss of resistance to FQ, which was already observed on an artemisinin-resistant phenotype of the same species [149] .

The attempts to insert an organometallic moiety in already known antimalarials were based on the idea to improve their activity or to overcome the resistance of the parasite to the parent drug. Results remained, for most of them, within expectations, except for CQ analogs and the serendipitous discovery of FQ. The extensive structure-activity studies, realized on the ferrocenic CQ conjugates, provided important information about the role of the ferrocene core in antimalarial activity. The position of the ferrocenyl moiety in the lateral side chain of CQ was probed with precision. The results formed the basis for new ideas and quinine, melfoquine, and artemisinin were derivatised. The influence of the ferrocenyl moietyl on the lipophilicity is really important when considering that an antimalarial drug has to cross at least three membranes before reaching the parasite cytoplasm and five to six membranes to reach the inner part of the parasite mitochondria or the plastid. The fine analysis of FQ properties led to the underlining of the possible specific role of the ferrocene core in the antimarial activity via the production of hydroxyl radicals. The presence of a specific intramolecular hydrogen bond in the molecule seems to be an important factor for its activity. It was postulated that this weak interaction confers to FQ a potency to interact with membrane lipids and to be specifically present at the site of action when it can be the most efficient. The insertion of the ferrocene moiety in the weak base CQ undoubtedly increased its ability to target the parasite digestive vacuole and possibly enables the drug to escape the resistance mechanisms.
