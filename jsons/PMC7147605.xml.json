Prior to the 2014 West Africa outbreak, the world had experienced a series of global disease outbreaks such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2002\u20132004 and H1N1 influenza virus in 2009. In 2009, both the global financial crisis and the H1N1 pandemic impacted global travel, with a 4% decrease to 880 million international arrivals (Leggat, Brown, Aitken, & Speare, 2010). Several studies have consistently found that pandemics contribute to heightened concerns about international travel (Lee et al., 2012, Kuo et al., 2008).",

For instance, during the rising prevalence of H1N1 in 2009, the Australian Government introduced a series of procedures that were geared toward incoming and outgoing travelers (Leggat et al., 2010). In addition, Leggat, Brown, and Speare (Leggat et al., 2010) found that while more than half of Queensland travelers showed some concern over the pandemic, a majority would not postpone travel even if they demonstrated H1N1-like symptoms. Another study by Lee et al. (2012) found that perceptions associated with H1N1 were not significant predictors of travel intentions. However, Reisinger and Mavondo (2005) found that perceptions of a disease are important indicators of altered travel patterns. One possible explanation is that travelers might develop adaptive behaviors (personal health interventions) which may prevent them from contracting the disease.",

Understanding travelers' behaviors warrants further exploration because of the unique nature of the Ebola outbreak in the U.S and several confirmed Ebola cases within the U.S. In addition, constant media coverage of Ebola cases in the U.S. might lead to travel avoidance even for travel within the U.S. Likewise, there is a paucity of literature which examines perceptions, beliefs, and attitudes that travelers have pertaining to the transmission and prevention of Ebola. While health experts argued that the possibility of contracting Ebola in the U.S is marginal, public opinion might be altered due to constant media coverage. Coupled with the fact that this was the first time that Ebola cases were confirmed in the U.S., the authors were interested to know to what extent such perceptions might influence travel intentions. Additionally, minimal attention has been given to the relationship between a pandemic and domestic travel.",

The Health Belief Model (HBM) is often considered an alternative because it considers risk perceptions to be one of the key drivers of behaviors (Brewer & Hallman, 2006). The model suggests that engagement in a protective behavior may be influenced by perceived costs and benefits of such a behavior (Chapman & Coups, 1999).",

Individuals are more likely to engage in risk reduction behaviors if they feel susceptible to a specific illness/condition, perceive the illness/condition to be severe, and/or believe that preventive behaviors outweigh the costs of engagement (Chapman & Skinner, 2008). The model contains six major key constructs: perceived susceptibility, perceived severity, perceived benefits, perceived barriers, cues to action, and self-efficacy.",

When assessing the model's constructs, perceived barriers and perceived benefits have been found to have the strongest predictive powers (Janz and Becker, 1984, Carpenter, 2010). Perceived severity has been found to exhibit the weakest predictive power for behavior choices (Janz & Becker, 1984). Several factors that may have moderating influences on the predictive power of the HBM are: length of time when measuring beliefs and behavior; treatment vs. prevention actions; and regimens pertaining to certain behaviors (Carpenter, 2010). One study discovered that individuals are more accepting of preventive measures when they believe that there are benefits to adopting the behavior and if they perceive that they are susceptible to a particular disease (Brewer & Fazekas, 2007).",

The usage of the HBM constructs of perceived susceptibility and perceived severity are associated with individuals engaging in recommended protective behaviors (Bish & Michie, 2010). The constructs of perceived barriers and perceived benefits have been successfully utilized to predict the utilization of influenza vaccines (Chen, Fox, Cantrell, Stockdale, & Kagawa-Singer, 2007). In addition, perceived travel risk, subjective knowledge, and socio-demographic factors were added to the model to explore the roles of the aforementioned determinants of travel avoidance based on previous studies (Floyd, Gibson, Pennington-Gray, & Thapa, 2003).",

There are seven risks frequently discussed in the consumer behavior literature: financial, functional, physical, social, psychological, satisfaction, and time (Schiffman & Kanuk, 1991). Roehl and Fesenmaier (1992) later identified three dimensions of perceived risk: physical/equipment risk, vacation risk, and destination risk. Sonmez and Graefe (1998) identified four types of risks as most often associated with tourism: financial, psychological, satisfaction, and time. Similarly, Maser and Weiermair (1998) classified travel-related risks into several categories including, but not limited to: natural disasters, hygiene and diseases, crime, and accidents. Richter (2003) added health concerns as another category. These risk factors have been widely examined and consistently found to increase visitors' level of perceived destination risk (Larsen et al., 2009, Pizam and Mansfeld, 1996). Moreover, Barton (1994) classified 12 possible types of disasters that could affect visitors; three of them were related to natural environments, bacterial infection, and terrorist or war-related activities.",

While the Ebola outbreak has arguably not had the same impacts, concerns have been raised by travelers and government travel advisories. In this study, more than half of our sample indicated that they had concerns regarding Ebola during travel by air and more than half also indicated that they would not avoid traveling in light of recent Ebola cases in the U.S. This is consistent with the fact that airlines in the U.S. remained operational during the outbreak and that while the U.S. government did designate several airports for passenger screening, especially those traveling back from African countries which includes New York's John F. Kennedy, Chicago's O\u2032Hare, Atlanta's Hartfield-Jackson, Newark's Liberty, and Washington's Dulles Airport, the U.S. government travel advisories did not affect both international and domestic air travel. These findings are also consistent with a survey conducted by the Global Business Travel Association, which indicated that most respondents said the outbreak has had a minimal effect on business travel (Martin, 2014). As such, the quick reactions by the U.S. government to respond to the potential outbreak in the U.S. may have influenced travelers' decisions related to travel and curtailing their travel. Another possible reason is that we only asked respondents about their travel avoidance related to domestic travel (within the U.S.). As such, using international travel as a dependent variable may have yielded different results.",

This is an interesting finding which might yield unique results due to the context of a health risk.

The survey was conducted in October of 2014 during the height of the Ebola outbreak, during which time the U.S. public was bombarded with media coverage of the outbreak that might have shaped their perceptions. Thus, it may be challenging to generalize the results of the study beyond the time due to the prevalence of information in the media regarding this crisis. Ibuka et al. (2010) also noted that perceptions of disease changed over time along with the media coverage. Specifically, the decline in the engagement in the preventive health strategies (in this case travel avoidance) may also mirror the decline in media attention regarding Ebola in the United States. As such, further study should explore how perceptions of Ebola and other pandemics changed over time and how it relates to media attention, as well as engagement in the recommended health preventive strategies.

The adapted Health Belief Model helps us to understand this phenomenon. As predicted by the model, those with higher perceptions of risk, perceived susceptibility, and subjective knowledge were found to be more likely to avoid domestic travel, while those with higher levels of self\u2013efficacy demonstrated a lower propensity to avoid travel due to Ebola. It is important to note that the study did not specifically examine the role of \u201ccues to action.\u201d This is not to say that the construct is not important.

For instance, travelers may have also considered other logistic costs, such as fees for changing a travel itinerary or extending planned accommodations, as part of decision making in travel avoidance.
