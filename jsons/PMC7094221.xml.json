We chose the LearnCoil-VMF(http://nightingale.lcs.mit.edu) and ExPASy-Coils (http://www.ch.embnet.org/software/COILS) programs, as they were designed specifically to identify viral heptad repeat coiled coils and have been used successfully for a number of virus fusion proteins. As shown in Fig. 1\n, the programs indeed predicted the F1 protein HR1 and HR2 regions, which were quite similar to each other, but sequences predicted by LearnCoil-VMF were longer than those predicted by the ExPASy-Coils programs. The actual HR1 and HR2 sequences chosen in this paper were somewhat longer than those predicted by LearnCoil-VMF. For HR1 and HR2 gene construction, the HR1 region used was derived from amino acids 124 to 170, which gave rise to seven additional amino acids. The HR2 region used was derived from amino acids 443 to 474, which gave rise to one additional amino acid in comparison with the LearnCoil-VMF prediction. The HR1 and HR2 genes, respectively, were constructed by PCR and cloned into the GST fusion expression vector pGEX-6P-1BamHI\u2013XhoI restriction sites, in which there is a rhinovirus 3C protease cleavage site for the fusion protein (the same as the commercial PreScission protease cleavage site). The positive plasmids were verified by direct DNA sequencing.",

These results indicated that homologous HR2 was a strong inhibitor preventing paramyxovirus-cell membrane fusion (Fig. 5\n). Indeed, clinical trials involving a number of promising agents have commenced, including the fusion inhibitor T-20 (brand name: Fuzeon). Fuzeon was recently approved by the US FDA as the first HIV entry inhibitor to be used for the treatment of AIDS patients who failed to respond to the current antiretroviral drugs, e.g., the reverse transcriptase inhibitors and protease inhibitors [25], [26]. Meanwhile, currently in medical development [20] is the mimicking of a carboxy-terminal region (HR2) paramyxovirus MeV and RSV inhibitor. The search for a membrane fusion inhibitor is an area of avid interest to a growing number of laboratories.",

The result also showed that only APMV-1 synthetic HR2 protein was a fusion inhibitor of APMV-1, and neither APMV-1 HR1 protein, APMV-2 HR1 protein, nor APMV-2 HR2 protein showed any cross-inhibition activity for APMV-1 (Fig. 6\n). It is becoming increasingly clear that among different members of the Paramyxoviridae, HN glycoprotein is specific [12]. There have been further reports about the antiviral activity of homologous HR, but few papers have reported examining HR specificity. For Retroviridae, HR2 peptides from human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) and HIV-2 and Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) all inhibited HIV-1 Env-mediated fusion, but three HR2 peptides were poor inhibitors of HIV-2 and SIV fusion [27]. The reason [28] could be that folding into a six-helix bundle is much faster for HIV-1 than for SIV. For Herpesviridae, the HR region of Bovine herpesvirus-1 (BoHV-1) glycoprotein inhibited the Herpes simplex virus (HSV) and the Pseudorabies virus (PRV) [7]. However, the human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) HR region blocked HCMV entry, though neither affected Murine cytomegalovirus (MCMV) nor HSV entry [6]. For Paramyxoviridae, APMV-1 and APMV-2 synthetic HR2 peptides of the genus Rubulavirus had specific virus-cell fusion inhibition activity, and in this study demonstrated no cross-inhibiting activity between APMV-1 and APMV-2. To pursue the possible factors that were correlative with the virus cross-inhibiting activity of the HR peptide, we compared the peptide\u2019s amino acid sequences between viruses. We found the following: the HR peptide amino acid identity between HIV-1 and SIV was about 50%, which peptides had partly virus cross-inhibiting activity; the HR peptide amino acid identity between BoHV-1 and HSV and PRV was over 60%, which peptides had potent virus cross-inhibiting activity; and the HR peptide amino acid identity between HCMV and MCMV and HSV was under 50% (45 and 20%, respectively), which peptides had no virus cross-inhibiting activity. We also found that the HR peptide amino acid identity between APMV-1 and APMV-2 of the genus Rubulavirus was about 40% and no virus cross-inhibitory activity was detected. These results indicate that the correlation of virus cross-inhibition HR peptide activity with sequence homology of the peptide between viruses is remarkable, in which 50% HR peptide sequence homology could be a key factor, though it has still not been determined.",

            "text": "An unresolved issue exists regarding the mechanism of HR2 membrane fusion inhibition. The interaction assays of APMV HR1 and HR2 support the notion that the synthetic HR2 could prevent formation of the six-helix bundle structure inhibiting membrane fusion by binding to the homologous partner, which is consistent with the hypothesis introduced above [13], [19], [21], [24]. Meanwhile, studies have found that the F protein HR2 peptide is able to interact with some HN protein domains before a conformation change of the virus (including APMV-1 [29], [30], [31]) F protein. Therefore, some researchers speculate that the synthetic HR2 might block F protein activation by the HN protein, to prevent an F protein conformation state from inhibiting virus entry [30], [31], [32]. This is another possible reason for HR2 inhibition activity, although the interaction mechanism between HN and HR2 is unclear. In our study, the polykaryon formation infected by APMV-1 or APMV-2 was reduced in the presence of homologous HR2 peptides, indicating that the synthetic HR2 might have inhibition activity in the early state of APMV entry. Other reports, however, have indicated that the paramyxovirus HR2 peptide could inhibit for some time [13], [21], [24] virus-cell membrane fusion after virus-cell incubation. In a word, synthetic HR2 might prevent viral membrane fusion in the early state (before an F protein conformation change), and not just inhibit membrane fusion in the later state (by binding to HR1 in the intermediate conformational state). This study speculates that on the basis of two different mechanisms synthetic HR2 might prevent APMV entry. The paper supports and supplements a current favored mechanism and provides a basis for developing antiviral drugs.",
