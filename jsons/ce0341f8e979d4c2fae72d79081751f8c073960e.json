Taking time for intervention into account, we considered four comprehensive intervention scenarios. The first intervention scenario was to start intervention on March 9, 2020 and the weight was 1. The second intervention scenario was to start limited intervention on March 9 (the weight was 0.5) and one week later to start complete intervention (the weight was 1). The third intervention scenario was that in the first week (starting on March 9) no intervention was taken (the weight was 0); in the second week, take limited intervention (the weight was 0.5); and after the third week, take full intervention (the weight was 1).

The first question is whether comprehensive non-drug public health intervention is required or not. The second question is how important is the intervention time.

We observed that delaying intervention for one month caused the maximum number of cumulative cases increase from 211,000 to 3,929,641 and increased 18.62 times. Using 3.4% as the average case fatality rate, the number of deaths increased from 7,174 to 133,608. We analyzed 102 countries and identified 44 countries for which delaying intervention for one month led to serious consequences. For example, delaying intervention for one month in Italy, Iran, USA and Germany increased the maximum number of cumulative cases from 29,475 to 1,493,498, from 37,428 to 729,274, from 5,278 to 293,797, and from 8,795 to 144,542, respectively. We also simulated the impact of delaying intervention for one week or two weeks on controlling the spread of coronavirus (scenarios 2 and 3). The impact of delaying one or two weeks on the spread of the coronavirus was between the immediate intervention and delaying intervention for one month.

Scenarios 2 and 3 may be more realistic. Comparisons among several strategies To further illustrate the impact of interventions on the spread of COVID-19, we comprehensively compare the effects of the four intervention scenarios on the transmission dynamics of COVID-19 across the world. Figure 2 plotted the world reported and forecasted time curves of the cumulative and newly confirmed cases of Covid-19 under four intervention scenarios. The ratios of the world number of final cases in the four scenarios were 1:1.5:3.3:18.6 and ratios of case duration under the four intervention scenarios were 1:1:1.2:1.4. These results showed that intervention time delays had serious consequences. Later intervention may increase almost 20 fold (18.6) the number of cases when Covid-19 would be over and will delay the ending time by almost two months. The ratio of the average increase index of new cases under the four intervention scenarios were respectively 1:2.88:5.88:30. Delaying intervention will substantially speed the spread of coronavirus.Figure S2presented the forecasted duration, cumulative cases of outbreak end, and risk of the top 44 outbreak countries in the world where the risk index was defined as the ratio of the number of cumulative cases under intervention scenario , = 2,3,4 over the number of cumulative cases under intervention scenario 1. We observed that risks of later intervention among the top the 43 countries(China excluded) varied from 7 (Finland) to 241 (Ecuador). In other words, among these countries, the All rights reserved.
