            "text": "Photosynthetic acclimation to elevated CO 2 cannot presently be predicted due to our limited understanding of the molecular mechanisms and metabolic signals that regulate photosynthetic gene expression. We have examined acclimation by comparing changes in the leaf content of RuBP carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) with changes in the transcripts of Rubisco subunit genes and with leaf carbohydrate metabolism. When grown at 1000 mm 3 dm -3 CO 2 , 12 of 16 crop species at peak vegetative growth had a 15-44% decrease in leaf Rubisco protein, but with no specific association with changes in transcript levels measured at midday. Species with only modest reductions in Rubisco content (10-20%) often had a large reduction in Rubisco small subunit gene mRNAs (> 30%), with no reduction in large subunit gene mRNAs. However, species with a very large reduction in Rubisco content generally had only small reductions in transcript mRNAs. Photosynthetic acclimation also was not specifically associated with a change in the level of any particular carbohydrate measured at midday. However, a threshold relationship was found between the reduction in Rubisco content at high CO 2 and absolute levels of soluble acid invertase activity measured in plants grown at ambient or high CO 2 . This relationship was valid for 15 of the 16 species examined. There also occurred a similar, albeit less robust, threshold relationship between the leaf hexose/sucrose ratio at high CO 2 and a reduced photosynthetic capacity \u2265 20%. These data indicate that carbohydrate repression of photosynthetic gene expression at elevated CO 2 may involve leaf sucrose cycling through acid invertase and hexokinase.",

However, the magnitude of this acclimation response can vary not only between different species, but also among different varieties or cultivars of the same species grown under controlled conditions (e.g. Campbell 1997; Kalina & Ceulemans 1997) . Furthermore, the extent by which photosynthetic capacity may be reduced at elevated CO 2 in a given species can be modulated by a number of factors including light (Ghannoum et al. 1997; Sims, Seemann & Luo 1998) , nutrient availability (Tissue et al. 1993; Seneweera et al. 1994; Nakano et al. 1997) , water availability (Roden & Ball 1996; Scarascia-Mugnozza et al. 1996) , and tissue developmental stage (Van Oosten & Besford 1995; Xu, Gifford & Chow 1996) . However, there presently is no basis to predict photosynthetic acclimation to elevated CO 2 , in large part due to a lack of understanding of the regulatory mechanisms and metabolic signals involved.",

An increase in leaf carbohydrates has long been associated with an inhibition of photosynthesis (e.g. Neals & Incoll 1968 ) and may account for the downregulation of photosynthetic capacity that can occur in plants exposed to elevated CO 2 (Van Oosten, Wilkins & Besford 1994) . However, end-product inhibition of photosynthesis is not due to increased carbohydrate content per se, but instead is associated with the metabolism of hexoses probably derived from sucrose hydrolysis (Goldschmidt & Huber 1992; Krapp et al. 1993) . Hexokinase has been proposed to function as a sugar sensor in the cytosol of plant mesophyll cells (Jang & Sheen 1994; Jang et al. 1997) . During phosphorylation of hexoses, hexokinase is hypothesized to initiate a signal cascade that results in the repressed expression of a number of photosynthetic genes (Sheen 1994; Smeekens & Rook 1997) , but there are many aspects of this process that are not known.",

First, we have evaluated acclimation (as a reduction in Rubisco content) in relation to leaf carbohydrate metabolism and in relation to rbcS and rbcL transcript levels to determine which, if any, parameters may be useful for predicting acclimation. Carbohydrate metabolism was examined by measuring the accumulation of specific leaf sugars and the activities of sucrose-phosphate synthase (SPS) and soluble acid invertase. Activities of these two enzymes are important to consider since they largely control the level of sucrose accumulation and hexose production within leaves (Huber 1989; Goldschmidt & Huber 1992) . Secondly, we have used the correlative information to help elucidate the mechanism for carbohydrate signalling at elevated CO 2 and to identify affected molecular mechanisms that control Rubisco content.",

The accumulation of total non-structural carbohydrates (TNC) in leaves varied substantially between species grown at either ambient or elevated CO 2 (Fig. 4) . Species with the greatest amounts of TNC (cotton, cucumber, soybean, tomato and parsley) had relatively high levels of starch. The present carbohydrate data notably are closer to actual mesophyll levels than those reported in previous studies due to our removal of as much vein material as reasonably possible prior to analyses. None the less, the absolute amount of TNC at high CO 2 was not closely correlated with photosynthetic acclimation. For example, at high CO 2 Arabidopsis had relatively low carbohydrate levels and greatly reduced Rubisco protein content, while parsley had relatively high TNC levels but no reduction in Rubisco content. Furthermore, cotton, cucumber and soybean accumulated the greatest amounts of TNC, yet none of these species had a very large reduction in Rubisco protein content (all < 25%). Photosynthetic acclimation also was not associated with the accumulation of any particular sugar. For example, a number of species such as cotton, soybean and tomato had high levels of Photosynthetic acclimation to elevated CO 2 907 starch at high CO 2 and had a reduced Rubisco content (Fig. 5) . However, this relationship was not consistent. Parsley had a substantial amount of starch and no reduction in Rubisco content, while several species had a reduced Rubisco level but a relatively low amount of starch (e.g. Arabidopsis, plantain and radish).",

A decline in leaf Rubisco content was not necessarily associated with increased TNC. TNC changed very little in several species which had reduced Rubisco levels (e.g. sunflower, wheat and radish). Also, TNC increased 3-fold in spinach, but Rubisco content did not decline. Similarly, changes in leaf hexose content were not specifically associated with adjustments in Rubisco content at high CO 2 . For example, leaf hexoses increased 2\u00b75-fold in spinach, but Rubisco content did not change. Also, there were minimal changes in leaf hexoses at high CO 2 in a number of species which had substantial declines in Rubisco content (e.g. bean, radish and sunflower). Next, we measured activities of SPS (under V max conditions) and soluble acid invertase (Table 2) in the same leaf material used for the previously described measurements. SPS activities declined by \u2265 35% in a few species grown at high CO 2 (e.g. bean, cotton, cucumber and plantago), with smaller differences in other species. Acid invertase activities also declined substantially in only a few species at high CO 2 (e.g. radish, soybean and wheat; about a 25% decline). For all species grown at high CO 2 , the relative mean SPS activity was 87% and the relative mean soluble acid invertase activity was 82%. The SPS activities of species did not correlate with measured leaf sucrose levels, nor were acid invertase activities closely associated with total hexose or total sucrose levels (analyses not shown). The general decline in leaf SPS activities at high CO 2 was not correlated with specifiec decreases in Rubisco content (Fig. 8) . Since a number of species had similar relative leaf SPS activities, but very different relative Rubisco contents, one cannot predict photosynthetic acclimation based on measured SPS activities.",

Values for bugle, cucumber, parsley and plantain include raffinose sugars, galactinol, mannitol and/or sorbitol. These sugars were not present at significant levels in the other species for whom values reflect only cumulative amounts of glucose, fructose, sucrose and starch. For a species, the average increase in soluble sugars was 29% (median increase 26%), and in starch 161% (median increase 135%). photosynthetic acclimation was related to the absolute level of acid invertase activity measured from plants grown at either ambient or high CO 2 (Fig. 9) . High acid invertase activities were always associated with a decrease in photosynthetic capacity at high CO 2 . Also, the absence of photosynthetic acclimation at high CO 2 (group 1 species in Table 1 ) occurred only in species with low activities of acid invertase. The data indicate that a threshold relationship exists between the level of acid invertase activity and photosynthetic acclimation to high CO 2 . Notably, in plants grown at ambient CO 2 , there was a 3-fold increase in invertase activity from the highest of the non-acclimating species to the lowest of the acclimating species. The threshold relationship between enzyme activity and acclimation was valid for 15 of the 16 species examined. The sole exception was bean which had only a low activity of acid invertase, but did have a substantial reduction in leaf Rubisco content when grown at high CO 2 . Since acid invertase catalyses the hydrolysis of sucrose to glucose plus fructose, we also examined to what extent one can predict photosynthetic acclimation at high CO 2 based on the amounts of leaf hexose-carbon that are present relative to sucrose-carbon (Fig. 10) . High hexose/sucrose ratios (> 2\u00b70) were present only in Arabidopsis, radish, sunflower and tomato. These species all showed substantial photosynthetic acclimation (\u2265 20% decline). A number of species that also showed photosynthetic acclimation had more moderate values of the leaf hexose/sucrose ratio, but these values increased substantially at high CO 2 . These species included cucumber, plantain, soybean and tobacco, with respective ratios at high CO 2 of 0\u00b729, 1\u00b74, 0\u00b739 and 0\u00b797. Thus, a hexose/sucrose ratio > 0\u00b725 for leaves collected at high CO 2 was associated with a \u2265 20% decline in photosynthetic capacity in eight of Photosynthetic acclimation to elevated CO 2 911 \u00a9 1998 Blackwell Science Ltd, Plant, Cell and Environment, 21, 905-915 nine species. The sole exception again was bean. However, a moderate decline in Rubisco content (10-20%) at high CO 2 was not associated with either a high leaf hexose/sucrose ratio or an increased value in that ratio.",

The use of leaf Rubisco content as a biochemical indicator of the photosynthetic capacity of a species is generally reasonable, since within a given species adjustments in Rubisco content commonly result in corresponding adjustments in the photosynthetic rate (Evans & Seemann 1989; Stitt & Schulze 1994 ). However, the differential adjustments amongst species in leaf Chl and Rubisco contents that occurred at elevated CO 2 (Fig. 3) indicate that the responses of different photosynthetic components are not necessarily linked. None the less, the relationship between leaf acid invertase activity and Rubisco content is important for identifying the mechanism of photosynthetic acclimation, for use as a tool to predict acclimation, and also possibly as a target for plant transformation.",

Goldschmidt & Huber (1992) provided evidence that sucrose cycling may occur in mesophyll cells of mature leaves under sink-limited conditions through sucrose hydrolysis by vacuolar acid invertase coupled with hexose phosphorylation by cytosolic hexokinase. If hexokinase can function as a flux sensor (Graham, Denby, & Leaver 1994; Koch 1996) , then the increased provision of hexoses from sucrose cycling could account for the generation of a primary carbohydrate signal. There is apparently no direct evidence from any metabolite labelling studies that sucrose cycling does occur in leaves. None the less, there are several lines of indirect evidence that such can occur. First, overexpression of a yeast invertase gene in the vacuole of mature tobacco leaves resulted in an accumulation of leaf hexoses and an inhibition of photosynthesis (Sonnewald et al. 1991) . Secondly, an analogous pathway of sucrose cycling that involves sucrose synthase rather than acid invertase has been shown to occur in potato tubers and certain other nonphotosynthetic tissues (Geigenberger & Stitt 1993) . Thirdly, sucrose cycling at high CO 2 through acid invertase might be expected to increase the leaf hexose/sucrose ratio as observed in many species in this study (Fig. 10 ), in part due to the relatively low activity of leaf hexokinase (e.g. Huber 1989) .",

            "text": "Bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) had an anomalous response at elevated CO 2 , since photosynthetic acclimation occurred although soluble acid invertase activity was quite low (Fig. 9 ). There is some evidence that plant carbohydrate signalling can also occur by transport of external hexoses or even sucrose across the plasmalemma (Koch 1996; Smeekens & Rook 1997) . One such mechanism may involve leaf sucrose hydrolysis by cell wall invertase, thus establishing a futile sucrose cycle between the apoplast and mesophyll cell (Foyer 1987) . The transport of hexoses into the mesophyll cell and/or their subsequent phosphorylation may result in carbohydrate signalling, as apparently occurs in tobacco plants transformed to express yeast invertase in the leaf apoplasm (Stitt, von Schaewen & Willmitzer 1990) . Whether any such alternate mechanisms may account for bean photosynthetic acclimation remains to be determined (see also below). However, the low hexose/sucrose ratio in bean at elevated CO 2 is indirect evidence against any invertaserelated signalling mechanism.",

Growth at elevated CO 2 altered this coordination, and in different ways, in many of the species examined in this study (Table 1 ). The adjustments in plant development that commonly occur at elevated CO 2 (Bowes 1993) can complicate comparisons between species. In this study though, similar relative adjustments were repeatedly observed in leaf Rubisco protein and message levels in different, mature plants during vegetative growth and, when examined, in leaves just older than the youngest, full-sized (data not shown). The relative lack of coordination between Rubisco content and message levels at elevated CO 2 (Fig. 2) more probably reflects the complexity of molecular control of Rubisco content. The control of Rubisco content involves a number of processes, including transcription, post-transcription (e.g. message stability), translation and/or post-translation (e.g. protein turnover) events (Berry et al. 1986; Shirley & Meagher 1990; Wanner & Gruissem 1991) . In some species, there may have even occurred an altered diurnal rhythm in mRNA accumulation. Nonetheless, during growth of species at elevated CO 2 , there apparently did occur differential adjustments in the control of these processes, which are described as follows.",

            "text": "In a few species, transcript levels of both rbcS and rbcL genes were increased at high CO 2 even though Rubisco content was unchanged (e.g. corn) or even decreased (e.g. plantain). The reason for such stimulation of transcript levels is not clear, but the overall response suggests that translation of messages of both rbcS and rbcL genes can be directly or indirectly affected at high CO 2 . In a second response pattern to high CO 2 , there occurred a large decrease (> 30%) in rbcS mRNA, no decline in rbcL mRNA, and generally only a modest decrease in Rubisco content (e.g. parsley plus group 2 species). The simplest explanation for this response is that rbcS gene transcription may be reduced and either rbcL mRNA is not efficiently translated (as in tobacco rbcS antisense plants; Rodermel et al. 1996) or large subunit protein may accumulate in excess (as has been observed in tomato at high CO 2 ; Fig. 4 , Van Oosten & Besford 1995) . In these species, Rubisco protein content may be controlled in large part by the abundance of small subunit protein. In a third response pattern, there occurred a very large reduction in Rubisco content in the absence of appreciable adjustments in the levels of either transcript (e.g. bean, radish and tobacco). The control of Rubisco content in these species is probably rather complex. Possibly, either one or both of the subunit mRNAs are not efficiently translated, or Rubisco protein turnover may increase at high CO 2 . In these species, the primary target(s) for gene repression may involve specific translation factors for mRNA of either small or large subunit genes, specific proteases, and/or some dysfunction in the processing of small subunit protein or assembly of holoenzyme. Finally, in a fourth response pattern that occurred only in Arabidopsis, levels of rbcS and rbcL mRNAs and Rubisco content all substantially decreased at high CO 2 in an apparently co-ordinated manner. This response suggests that control of Rubisco content can be determined largely by message level, as discussed in more detail previously (Cheng, Moore & Seemann 1998) .",

However, whether leaf sucrose cycling may occur under ambient CO 2 growth conditions is not known. Since a reduction of vacuolar invertase activity by co-suppression in tomato leaves did not affect leaf photosynthetic rates (Scholes et al. 1996) , sucrose cycling may be evident only under pronounced sink-limited conditions. This possibility is strengthened by the demonstration that in tobacco transformed to overexpress yeast invertase in the apoplast or vacuole, source but not sink leaves have bleached and/or necrotic sectors that are associated with reduced photosynthesis (Sonnewald et al. 1991) . Based on diurnal leaf responses, night-time starch metabolism was previously suggested as one component of carbohydrate signalling (Cheng, Moore & Seemann 1998) , and hydrolytic starch degradation also could generate substrate for the hexokinase reaction. Starch-accumulating species are often noted for their susceptibility to down-regulation of photosynthetic capacity under sink-limited conditions (e.g. Goldschmidt & Huber 1992; Farrar & Williams 1991) . In this study, though, we did not observe a close coupling between starch accumulation and photosynthetic acclimation (Fig. 5) . One extension of the idea that starch metabolism is in some aspects a buffer to sucrose metabolism (Stitt 1984) , is the possibility that starch metabolism in part may function to minimize leaf sucrose cycling. From this viewpoint, species that are more active in starch metabolism may be more likely to experience sink-limited growth conditions, as often occurs at high CO 2 .",
