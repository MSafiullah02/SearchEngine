The predominant influenza subtype found was A/H3N2/ which was notably diagnosed in patients over 25 years of age. This subtype was also often diagnosed in older people of 65+ years, which is in line with the risk assessment prepared by the European Center for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) at the beginning of the season. The A/H3N2/ subtype was most often diagnosed in the West Pomeranian and Warmian-Masurian Voivodeships. In this epidemic season, there were 11 coinfections of the A/H3N2/ subtype with other influenza and influenza-like viruses recorded in Poland. A different situation had occurred in the 2014/2015 season, when the subtype A/H3N2/ also was predominant, but the virus was most commonly diagnosed in children up to 14 years of age. In both seasons, the least confirmations were observed in patients between 15 and 24 years.",

We found that the A/H3N2/ subtype of influenza virus predominated in Poland during the 2016/2017 season. This finding contrasted with the preceding 2015/2016 season when, although somehow fewer samples were tested, the A/H1N1/pdm09 subtype predominated Kowalczyk et al. 2017; Szyma\u0144ski et al. 2017a ). However, the A/H3N2/ also was a leading subtype in the 2014/2015 season, although it circulated together with the A/H1N1/ pdm09 subtype . Vice versa, in the still earlier 2013/2014 season, the A/H3N2/ circulated together with the then predominant A/H1N1/pdm09 (Bednarska et al. 2015) . These findings suggest that the two influenza virus subtypes, A/H3N2/ and A/H1N1/ pdm09, assume the leading epidemiological role alternately every other year.",

In Europe, two-thirds of the cases diagnosed as the A/H3N2/ infection were identified as belonging to subclass 3C.2a1 that is antigenically close to the 3C.2a, a subclass from which the vaccine was derived for the subsequent 2017/ 2018 epidemic season (Flu News Europe 2017, WHO 2017b). Data collected in this study point to a typical pattern of seasonal influenza epidemic, with the majority of infections in the age groups of 0-4, 5-9, and 65+ years, i.e., the most vulnerable age categories. The predominant influenza virus subtype seems irregularly variable in successive seasons. In 2013/2014 and 2014/2015, co-predomination of the A/H1N1/pdm09 and A/H3N2/ subtypes was observed, whereas A/H1N1/pdm09 predominated alone in 2015/ 2016 and A/H3N2/ in the 2016/2017 season.
