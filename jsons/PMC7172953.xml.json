            "text": "The Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) belongs to the genus of alphaviruses (Togaviridae) with enzootic and epizootic serotypes. Within this same group are the equine encephalitis viruses of the East and West, Mayaro, Mucambo and Everglades (Zacks and Paessler, 2010; Gardner et al., 2016). VEEV is an emerging infectious disease in Latin America (Aguilar et al., 2011; Vittor et al., 2016). The outbreaks have been reported for decades in countries with enzootic circulation, the implementation of surveillance systems has allowed the detection of additional human cases in countries and areas with previously unknown VEEV activity. The enzootic subtypes of VEEV are frequently detected and isolated in ecological habitats, where they circulate in transmission cycles between rodents and mosquitoes. The main vertebrate reservoirs are rodents of wild species of Oryzomys, Zigodontomys, Heteromys, Peromyscus and Proechimys. These animals become infected in nature and develop viremia that is sufficient to infect the vectors (Johnson and Martin, 1974; Deardorff and Scott, 2010).",

            "text": "Bats, the only flying mammals are abundant and diverse, geographically extended on all continents except at the poles. They provide important eco-systemic services, such as pollination, seed dispersal and insect control among others. However, some bat species are capable of transmitting pathogenic viruses such as rabies and possibly Ebola and coronaviruses. Bats harbor more zoonotic viruses per species than rodents and are now recognized as an important source of zoonotic agents (Luis et al., 2013). Recently some viruses associated with bats have been identified that are closely related to human pathogens, including hepacivirus, pegivirus (Quan et al., 2013), influenza A virus (Tong et al., 2012), hantavirus (Guo et al., 2013) and paramyxoviruses such as mumps and respiratory syncytial virus (Drexler et al., 2012). Arenavirus (Malmlov et al., 2017). Bats are also important reservoirs; different studies have reported VEEV infection which suggests that bats could host arboviruses of public health impact in America (Correa et al., 1972; Seymour et al., 1978; Thompson et al., 2015; Sotomayor-Bonilla et al., 2017). Equines are usually susceptible to the virus and the fatality rate for horses is between 20 to 80% (Gil et al., 2017). The epidemic/epizootic types include the IAB and IC subtypes, both of which are responsible for large outbreaks of disease in humans and equines. The other subtypes, or enzootic viruses such as type ID, cause disease in humans and usually do not affect equines (Forrester et al., 2017; Gupta et al., 2017). Equines can serve as amplifiers of the epizootic form of viruses; and in this way they become the source of infection of thousands of mosquitoes during the febrile period. (Forrester et al., 2017). Culicidae mosquitoes (Diptera: Culicidae) occupy a preferential position due to their obligate hematophagy, maximum adaptability to multiple environments at different latitudes and altitudes, and a great variability of preferred hosts from which they can feed and in those that can spread the viruses. Some efficient vectors can be arthropods of the genera Aedes, Anopheles, Culex, Mansonia Psorophora and probably Ochlerotatus. The objective of the present study was to study the eco-epidemiology of alphaviruses in bats of departments of C\u00f3rdoba and Sucre, Colombia.",

The department of C\u00f3rdoba has the second largest equine population in Colombia, this issue is important because the prevention of disease in equines is fundamental through periodic vaccination. The ICA performs surveillance and control of equine encephalitis in susceptible animals through a national official control program and coordinates actions with public health authorities for the prevention of encephalitis in the human population (INS, 2017). However, despite these controls, cases of equine encephalitis occur throughout the Colombian Caribbean region. On the other hand, Colombian biodiversity is recognized worldwide, the country hosts the largest number of bat species in neotropical ecosystems, approximately 13% of all species in the world (Gardner, 2007).",

This description comprised less than 1% of the total number of blood tests of this mosquito species. In Papua New Guinea, Anopheles punctulatus mosquitoes were found to be fed blood from two species of frugivorous bats Dobsonia moluccensis and Dobsonia praedatrix (Logue et al., 2016). In Uganda, (Karabatsos, 1985; Kading and Schountz, 2016) identified multiple species of frugivorous bats in C. neavei, C. perfuscus fed bat\u2019s blood. In the species of mosquitoes C. decens, and Coquillettidia fuscopennata, several pathogenic arboviruses were identified in humans, including the Spondweni virus and ZIKAV of C. neavei (Diallo et al., 2014).",

            "text": "On the other hand, climate change and the emergence of infectious diseases are the most important ecological problems of our times (Rohr et al., 2011). In the case of Venezuelan equine encephalitis, mosquitoes are totally dependent on rainfall regimes because they are raised in flooded areas and the size of the population is directly related to the size of the breeding site (Gleiser et al., 2000). With respect to temperature, this can affect the distribution of the vector, the size of the vector, the feeding habits and the extrinsic incubation period (Lifson, 1996). In addition, the temperature has a direct effect on the intrinsic rate of growth since it has been observed that at high temperatures, the growth time is accelerated and the mosquitoes became adults faster (Focks et al., 2000), established a model in which increasing temperature, the females are fed more frequently and the survival rate in the egg stage is reduced. With fewer individuals, there is less larval competition and therefore the females will take better advantage of the resources of the breeding site and may reach a larger size. The main habitats for the principal urban vector species of arboviruses A. aegypti and A. albopictus are propitiated by humans that use water containers for storaging or accumulation of rainwater contribute to population mosquitoes (Morrison et al., 2004). Some local studies show that there is a relationship between precipitation and the abundance of vectors (Scott et al., 2000; Romero-Vivas, & Falconar, 2005), however, we were unable to find it.",
