No prodrome history of rhinorrhea, cough, respiratory distress, vomiting, diarrhea, or rash was reported. An 8-year-old sibling who lives in the home has had 2 days of runny nose and cough. No one else in the family is sick, and no recent travel outside the United States was reported. The infant has deteriorated rapidly with the appearance of uncontrollable seizure activity, and computed tomography of the brain revealed multiple areas of infarction. Pertinent laboratory results include a respiratory virus multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) panel positive for influenza A and coronavirus and negative blood and urine culture results. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was not obtained. Other laboratory results include a prothrombin time of 20.8 seconds, a partial thromboplastin time of 43 seconds, an alanine aminotransferase concentration of 319 u/L, an aspartate aminotransferase concentration of 709 u/L, and an albumin concentration of 2.7 g/dL. The patient has been treated for 48 hours empirically with vancomycin, cefotaxime, and acyclovir (20 mg/kg body weight per dose every 8 hours).",

From the perspective of evaluating potential infectious risk from this donor, bacterial etiologies are less of a concern, because the blood culture result was negative, and the patient has received >48 hours of antibiotic therapy. Furthermore, several studies have documented the safety of transplanting organs from donors with treated bacteremia, including bacterial meningitis [10\u201313]. Acute influenza-associated encephalitis syndrome is the leading diagnosis given the results of the respiratory virus panel and the 8-year-old sibling at home with possible influenza infection. Influenza-associated encephalitis is uncommon but well described, and it is associated with a poor outcome. For example, in the Australian Childhood Encephalitis Study 2013\u20132015 database, 13 patients with influenza-associated encephalitis were identified, and death or significant morbidity occurred in 7 of them [14]. However, the results of the respiratory virus multiplex PCR panel also could represent colonization or resolved infection and not be the cause of the encephalitis. HSV is clearly a potential cause of the infant\u2019s illness and is consistent with the elevated liver transaminase levels, low albumin level, and coagulopathy.",

The New York State encephalitis panel includes real-time PCR for adenovirus, CMV, Epstein\u2013Barr virus, enteroviruses, HSV types 1 and 2, human herpesvirus type 6, and varicella-zoster virus. Testing for arboviruses such as Eastern Equine or West Nile virus is included also but available only in the summer [15]. It was recommended that antibiotics and acyclovir be continued and oseltamivir added. The result of a blood HSV PCR was negative; CSF was not obtained. The infant\u2019s heart was donated, and the recipient underwent oseltamivir prophylaxis. No infectious complications were reported.",

Influenza and other respiratory virus infections, including those from coronavirus, have the potential to cause significant morbidity in SOT recipients, particularly in lung and, to a lesser extent, intestine recipients. Current guidelines recommend that potential lung and intestine donors who have been diagnosed with influenza within the previous 2 weeks be disqualified from donations. However, this recommendation might be tailored if the donor has received 5 days of antiviral therapy. Other organs (heart, liver, kidneys) can be accepted in the absence of completing an antiviral treatment course if additional consent is obtained and the donor and recipient undergo anti-influenza treatment and prophylaxis, respectively. Oseltamivir-resistant influenza should generally preclude donation, although susceptibility testing is not typically performed or readily available [16\u201318].",

In the absence of viremia, HSV is not likely to be transmitted via heart transplant, but the virus can be present in liver and kidneys.

            "text": "In 2015, more than 20% of all deceased donors were considered a PHS IRD because of their risky behavior or hemodiluted screening specimens [22]. By law, potential recipients must be counseled for and consent to the use of a PHS IRD organ at the time of listing [8]. If a patient does not provide consent, an IRD organ will not be offered to him or her. The growing opioid epidemic continues to increase the number of previously healthy young people becoming donors with the risk factors noted above. Therefore, it is important to understand the testing procedures and the window or eclipse period to help assess the true risk of transmission. The chance of an NAT result being falsely negative in this scenario is influenced by the window period for each virus, sensitivity of the screening test, and the risk of the donor having acquired one of these viruses in the recent past. The risk of missing an infection during the window period depends on the assay used. HIV would be missed in 12 of 10000 intravenous drug donors using serology compared to 5 of 10000 using NAT, and for HCV, the decrease is more dramatic, from 300 missed HCV cases with serology compared to 32 with NAT [23\u201325]. In a more recent article, the CDC performed mathematical modeling for the United States and found the overall risk to be low and to decrease even more the longer the donor testing was from the time of the last potential exposure. The risk of an NAT result being inaccurate is estimated to be, at most, 2.5%, and for HCV, the risk is almost zero if testing is performed at least 10 days after exposure [26].",

ID providers will be called on to evaluate recipients in this setting and offer recommendations regarding management of recipient exposures or infection.
