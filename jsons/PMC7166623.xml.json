The abdominal cavity and the omental fat were stained by yellow fluid (Fig 2). The gall bladder and the common bile duct were severely inflamed. Several perforations were observed in the gall bladder. The gall bladder was smoothly dissected from the surrounding hepatic tissue. Haemostasis was achieved with bipolar cautery. A 4\u20100 monofilament absorbable suture (Biosyn; Covidien) was circumferentially placed around the cystic artery and the cystic canal. The gall bladder was then resected and submitted for histopathology and bacteriology (Fig 3). Hepatic biopsy was also performed. Patency of the common bile duct was evaluated and the bile content was easily emptied in the duodenum by gentle pressure. The abdominal cavity was flushed with sterile warm saline repeatedly. The muscular layer and the subcutaneous layer were closed routinely. Recovery from anaesthesia was uneventful. A dose of 0\u00b72 mg/kg Meloxicam (Metacam; Boeringher Ingelheim) was given postoperatively once a day. The following day, the ferret was clinically improved and started to eat spontaneously. The medications (antibiotic and non\u2010steroidal anti\u2010inflammatory drugs) were continued. The ferret was discharged 3 days after admission.",

In domestic species, gall bladder perforations have been commonly associated with cholecystitis (Parchman and Flanders 1990, Ludwig et al.\n1997, Bromel et al.\n1998, Mayhew et al.\n2002). Ascending tract infections are involved in the pathogenesis of cholecystitis in cats and dogs (O'Neill et al.\n2006, Brain et al.\n2006). Escherichia coli is the most common bacteria isolated in cases of cholecystitis in cats and dogs (O'Neill et al.\n2006, Wagner et al.\n2007, Brain et al.\n2006, Huynh and Laloi 2013). In ferrets, some findings suggest that the same pathogenesis can be extrapolated. Helicobacter cholecystus was isolated in three ferrets which were part of a colony with signs of hepatobiliary lesions (Garcia et al.\n2002). The presented case showed direct ultrasonographic visualisation of a gas bubble which was consistent with a gas forming bacteria such as P. aeruginosa which was later isolated.",

Cholelithiasis and extrahepatic obstruction have been described but in the absence of rupture (Hall & Ketz\u2010Riley 2011, Hauptman et al.\n2011). Neoplasia of the biliary tract such as biliary cystadenomas are common in ferrets (Fox et al.\n1996). No sign of neoplasia was evident on histopathological examination of the submitted samples from the current case. Biliary infection by Eimeria species has been described in a ferret but did not cause any damage to the biliary tree (Williams et al.\n1996).",

However, some cases of hepatitis do not trigger elevation of alanine aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase or bilirubin as observed in this ferret (Burgess 2007). These laboratory finding differs significantly from previous cases reported with bile duct disorders (Hauptman et al.\n2011, Hall and Ketz\u2010Riley 2011). The finding of neutrophilic leukocytosis in cases of liver disease is variable, however, an association with concurrent peritonitis, as in this case, is common (Sista et al.\n2013).",

The common bile duct was enlarged and convoluted with signs of cholestasis but no effusion and no rupture were observed in the reported cases. No sign of obstruction was seen in this case but an intense hyperechogenicity of the biliary tree consistent with a cholecystitis was observed and peritoneal effusion was demonstrated. In a review of 10 dogs affected with bile peritonitis, abdominal ultrasound detected effusion in eight dogs (Amsellem et al.\n2006). Ultrasound guided fine needle aspirate of the peritoneal fluid is a useful tool to diagnose biliary peritonitis. Cytological examination may reveal yellow to green biliary pigment as seen in this case or a characteristic basophilic acellular matrix (Connally 2003, Owens et al.\n2003). Abdominal effusion and peritonitis in ferrets are reported in cases of systemic coronavirus infection as seen in feline infectious peritonitis (Garner et al.\n2008). In such cases, a yellow viscous effusion is seen but bile pigment is absent.",

The anatomy of the biliary tree in ferret is similar to other mammals as is the cholecystectomy technique (Poddar 1977, Blass and Seim 1985). The overall prognosis of biliary tract surgery in dogs ranges from 28 to 66% survival rate (Martin et al.\n1986, Fahie and Martin 1995, Ludwig et al.\n1997, Mehler 2011, Amsellem et al.\n2006). In these cases, bile peritonitis is not always a risk factor but if the peritonitis becomes septic, it is associated with increased mortality (Ludwig et al.\n1997, Mehler et al.\n2004). In a retrospective study of 26 cases, the prognosis of bile peritonitis in dogs was 31% survival rate (Mehler et al.\n2004). Haematological prognostic factor include a leukocytosis greater than 35\u00b77\u00d7109/L. Preoperative neutrophil counts are greater in cases of biliary rupture (Ludwig et al.\n1997, Amsellem et al.\n2006, Uno et al.\n2009). There is controversy as to whether hypoalbuminaemia is a risk factor. Mehler (2001) reported that it was not, whereas Amsellem et al. (2006) reported that it was. The leukocytosis and the hypoalbuminaemia found in this case reinforce the need for rapid management of such cases so that a positive prognosis is optimised.",
