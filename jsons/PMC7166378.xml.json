A daily dose of 200 mg amantadine sulphate (Infex\u00ae, Merz + Co. GmbH & Co, Frankfurt/M., Germany) or matched placebo were given orally twice daily for 48 weeks.

Considering the demographic, biochemical, virological and histological patients\u2019 characteristics, significant differences between both treatment groups were not present. The sustained virological response rates were similar in both treatment groups. Thus, with respect to the results of the present controlled study, the addition of amantadine sulphate to IFN\u2010\u03b1 does not improve the sustained virological response rates in nonresponders with chronic hepatitis C. These results confirm a larger controlled trial in 119 treatment naive patients with chronic hepatitis C which also showed no beneficial virological effect of the addition of amantadine sulphate to IFN\u2010\u03b1 treatment in these patients [23]. In contrast, a recently published study in 60 nonresponders, treated with IFN\u2010\u03b1, ribavirin and amantadine or IFN\u2010\u03b1 and amantadine, could demonstrate increased virological response rates in nonresponders with chronic hepatitis C who received amantadine [34]. However, these data have to be confirmed by larger randomized, double\u2010blind, placebo\u2010controlled trials in nonresponders with chronic hepatitis C.",

In the POMS scale all four subscores deteriorated during treatment with IFN\u2010\u03b1 alone in comparison with the corresponding baseline levels and remained impaired during the follow\u2010up period. The combined retreatment with IFN\u2010\u03b1 plus amantadine sulphate led to a smaller reduction of three of the four subscores, i.e. depression, vigor, and fatigue during treatment and interestingly, to a sustained improvement of the corresponding subscores in comparison with baseline levels at the end of the 24 week follow\u2010up period. A similar improvement during amantadine sulphate treatment has also been shown for patients with central nervous disease, including multiple sclerosis and Parkinson\u2019s disease [35]. In the present study, analysis of the SF\u201036 health\u2010related \u2018Everyday Life\u2019 questionnaire showed a sustained improvement of all six subscores in the group of patients treated with IFN\u2010\u03b1 plus amantadine sulphate at the end of the follow\u2010up period in comparison with the corresponding baseline scores while five of six subscores remained impaired in patients treated with IFN\u2010\u03b1 alone. A sustained improvement for the POMS scale and the SF\u201036 health\u2010related \u2018Everyday Life\u2019 questionnaire has also been reported in a previously published study in naive patients with chronic hepatitis C receiving IFN\u2010\u03b1/amantadine sulphate combination therapy compared with those treated with IFN\u2010\u03b1 alone [23].",
