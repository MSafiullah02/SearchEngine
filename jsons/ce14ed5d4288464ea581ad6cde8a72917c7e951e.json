However, if VS technologies can reduce the library size to 10's or 100's of compounds, many of these constraints are lifted allowing the use of more physiologically relevant or complex assays, potentially including whole animal-based assays, which are recognized as a viable alternative in today's search for novel pharmaceuticals. Another issue related to assay implementation is the selection of in vitro vs. in vivo assays. Many of the initial hits in enzyme/protein-based in vitro assays may fail at the cellular or animal level due to stability or metabolism issues. However, with the development of VS and post-HTS analysis methods, this can be minimized. Finally, assay selection has a strong influence on the outcome of the physical screen.
