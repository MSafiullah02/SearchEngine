The pathogen responsible, Mycobacterium tuberculosis, is the leading cause of death attributed to a single infectious organism [1]. Administered at birth as part of the Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) since 1974 [2], the vaccine Bacillus Calmette-Guerin (BCG) currently has 90% coverage globally. Despite this, one person dies of TB every 20 s [3]. The efficacy of BCG varies from 0 to 80% in protecting against pulmonary TB [4]. It is estimated that globally, BCG prevents only 5% of all vaccine-preventable deaths due to TB [5], the cruel irony being that BCG is least effective in the areas of the world where it is most needed. It is also these very areas where HIV infection rates are highest, a cohort for whom BCG is contraindicated, and for whom the risks of TB are higher. In areas where efficacy is preserved however, protection can be durable, with protective efficacy of over 50 years demonstrated in an Alaskan population [6].",

Major trials were initiated in the 1950s in the UK [11] and USA [12, 13], the results of which would set the tone for BCG trials of the future, in that the results were conflicting. The UK study involved 54,239 school children aged 14\u201315 years who were followed up for 20 years and demonstrated a protective efficacy of 77% [11]. In contrast, US trials involving 191,827 Puerto Rican school children aged 1\u201318 years [13] and 64,136 children aged above 5 years in Georgia and Alabama [12] showed a protective efficacy of only 16 and 29%, respectively, after 20 years follow-up. A critical moment in the acceptance of the variability in BCG efficacy came in 1980 with the publishing of the Chingleput trial [14]. Carried out in India and involving 73,459 individuals, in a highly surprising result, BCG provided no protection against TB [14]. Up to this point, much of the variance in reported efficacy had been put down to differences in trial design [15].",

The most significant factor influencing BCG efficacy that is supported by data is exposure to non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NTM) [19].

A subset of people exposed to M. tuberculosis are capable of achieving sterilising immunity post-exposure, termed early clearance [28]. The presence of latent M. tuberculosis infection (LTBI) is usually assessed via a tuberculin skin test (TST) or interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA), which when positive indicates immune sensitisation to M. tuberculosis, i.e. that an infection has occurred. In studies with a minimum of 2 years of longitudinal observation, the frequency of early clearance in household contacts of TB patients ranged from 3.4 to 26.8% when using TST conversion [28\u201330], whilst another study utilising IGRA conversion suggested 58% clearance [28]. A number of immune mechanisms for this have been proposed, including innate immune responses [31], antibody-innate cell interaction via Fc receptors [32] and lung resident T cells [33]. Investigations into a genetic basis for early clearance have found single nucleotide polymorphisms in NOD, and NRAMP1, suggesting a role for innate immunity in this process [34]. NOD2 signalling is already known to be increased post-BCG by up to a year through trained immunity [35].",

This phagocytosis is mediated principally by complement receptor 4 (CR4) [46]; however, AMs are highly heterogeneous in their phagocytic potential, with only 20% of AMs in culture becoming infected by M. tuberculosis even with high bacterial loads [47]. M. tuberculosis infection induces a phenotypic shift from oxidative phosphorylation (M2, anti-inflammatory) to aerobic glycolysis (M1, pro-inflammatory), resulting in increased IL-1\u03b2 levels and decreased IL-10 levels [48]. This polarisation to an M1 phenotype aids antimicrobial activity [49]. However, the TNF produced by AMs may be counterproductive, with exogenous application of TNF increasing both intracellular bacterial load and the number of infected AMs [47, 49].",

Neutrophils kill M. tuberculosis primarily through the respiratory burst and phagocytosis [57]. Whilst this response may appear to be beneficial, the reality is more complex, as is exemplified in the case of lipocalin-2. Lipocalin-2 is a constituent of neutrophil secondary granules, blocking bacterial scavenging of iron [58]. In mice, lipocalin-2 increases susceptibility to M. tuberculosis prior to granuloma formation [59], potentially via increasing the amount of iron available to intracellular mycobacteria [59].",

This trained immunity induced by BCG can confer heterologous protection against other pathogens in vitro [35]. BCG induced a two-fold increase in monocyte derived cytokines such as IL-1\u03b2 and TNF\u03b1 in response to an in vitro bacterial and fungal challenge.

The activation of TLR2 by mycobacterial lipoproteins induces excessive signalling, resulting in an inhibition of MHC II expression [93\u201395]. A reduction in cathepsin S (Cat-S) expression is seen in M. tuberculosis infected macrophages [96], associated with the induction of IL-10 [97]. Addition of anti-IL-10 antibodies has been shown to restore macrophage Cat S expression, increasing antigen presentation [97]. BCG-CatS is a recombinant BCG vaccine engineered to secrete active Cat S, and stimulates much stronger macrophage presentation of Ag85B to CD4+ T cells than BCG [115].",

A recombinant strain of BCG expressing ESX1 (BCG::ESX-1) is more protective than wild type BCG in mouse and guinea pig models, although this recombinant strain is more virulent [118]. By utilising the evolutionarily more distant ESX-1 from M.marinum, BCG::ESX-1Mmar has comparable efficacy and immunogenicity to BCG::ESX-1M. tuberculosis, yet has a safety profile comparable with BCG Pasteur in preclinical models [119].",

Listeriolysin O forms transmembrane \u03b2-barrel pores in the phagolysosome membrane, thus allowing the escape of antigens and mycobacterial DNA into the cytosol [122, 123]. By replacing urease C, the BCG construct is less able to alkalinise the phagolysosome, ensuring the activation of listeriolyin, which is active at a pH of 5.5 [124].

IL-17 is produced principally by Th17 cells, which require both TGF-\u03b2 and IL-16 for initiation [143\u2013145], in addition to IL-23 in order to become an established population. These IL-17-producing cells provide a surveillance function in the periphery [146], though in excess they can are associated with excess neutrophil recruitment [147, 148] and autoimmune disease [146, 149, 150]. Pathogenic overproduction of IL-17 is restricted by IFN-\u0263 [151\u2013153], limiting neutrophil accumulation and coincident lung inflammation during M. tuberculosis infection. IL-17 itself drives Th1 response by overcoming IL-10 inhibition [154], thus IL-17 and IFN-\u0263 have significant interplay [155]. Th17 cells have been found within the pulmonary lesions of TB patients, in addition to the less well characterised Th1/Th17 cells [156, 157]. Also known as Th1* cells, these are capable of producing both IFN-\u0263 and IL-17, but their role in TB is still unclear [156].",

This was associated with an IL-17-based M. tuberculosis-specific mucosal immune response following intranasal vaccination [158]. Neutralisation of IL-17 in vivo abrogated the M. tuberculosis-specific IgA secretion seen in the respiratory airways and reduced lung expression of polymeric immunoglobulin receptor (pIgR), which translocates IgA into the airway lumen [159].",

Much of the available data on this has come from murine studies. It is not always clear how these findings relate to NHPs and humans. Most of the lung resident T memory cells are of the TEM phenotype [160], CD44hi CD62Llo CD127hi [141, 161]. The TEM subset act in the first line of defence [162], predominantly secreting Th1 cytokines [160]. They are able to recirculate between blood, non-lymphoid tissues and lymph [163]. Studies of individuals with LTBI have demonstrated an increased level of the exhaustion marker PD-1 on T cells, perhaps due to continuous antigenic stimulation [164]. T cells from BCG vaccinated individuals were CD27+ but had low PD-1 expression, indicating an earlier stage of differentiation [164]. Despite this, the antigen-specific CD4+ T cell response of BCG-vaccinated human new-borns wanes over the first year of life, suggesting that the TEM population induced is unable to maintain persistent memory [165]. In response to continuous antigen exposure, TEM become terminally differentiated T effector (Teff) cells, losing the ability to proliferate and migrate into the lung parenchyma, expressing the KLRG1 marker [166, 167].",

The ability of TCM to confer greater protection than TEM is possibly best shown by adoptive transfer of the separate T subsets (Kaufmann et al.), in which TCM markedly protected against TB in contrast with TEM and T follicular helper (TFH) cells [126].

TRM permanently reside in non-lymphoid tissue, making them strategically placed for a rapid recall response [138]. As a group, TRM are highly heterogeneous, with some CD4+ TRM displaying a regulatory profile (Foxp3hi IL-10hi) and others with a more effector profile (T-bet+) [141]. In contrast, airway resident CD8+ TRM cells are more homogenous, expressing predominantly Th1 cytokines [141]. In addition to their cytolytic role, CD8+ TRM are also capable of activating bystander NK and B cells through IFN-\u0263, TNF\u03b1 and IL-2 [173]. Maintenance of TRM may be reliant on the presence of live bacilli, as clearance of BCG in mice with chemotherapy abrogates the antigen-specific CD4+ T cell response [166]. Of all the T memory cell subtypes, the mucosal transfer of CD8+ TRM cells was associated with the most protection against M. tuberculosis challenge on a per-cell basis [141].",

The superior protection was specific to the lungs, with protection in the spleen equal to that conferred by the intradermal route [139]. CXCR3 expression, key to the recruitment of CD8+ T cells [189], was only found in lung parenchymal CD4+ T cells with mucosal BCG vaccination [139]. A recent study in NHPs has demonstrated a superior protective effect of mucosal BCG immunisation compared with intradermal immunisation against low-dose repeated M. tuberculosis infection [190]. The mucosally immunised group showed higher local levels of polyfunctional Th17 cells, IL10 and mucosal IgA [190]. Though this work is highly promising, novel methods for the immunomonitoring of aerosol vaccination are necessary, due to the invasive nature of bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage.

When cynomolgus macaques were treated with rituximab, a B cell depleting agent (but not plasma cell depleting), the overall disease progression and outcome of M. tuberculosis infection in the acute phase was unaltered [193]. Though no change in outcome was seen, there was a significant increase in IL-2, IL-10 and IL-17 producing T cells within rituximab treated macaques, though IL-6 and IL-10 levels were lower in the granulomas themselves [193]. IL-6 and IL-10 are both secreted by B cells [194, 195], IL-6 increasing T cell development [196] and B cell expansion [194, 197]. In B cell-deficient mice, BCG was less effective as a result of the dysregulated IL-17 production [198, 199], the elevated IL-17 resulting in greater levels of phagocytosis of BCG by neutrophils rather than monocytes [200].",

Fc glycosylation could be a potential future biomarker, with the differences reflecting differential B cell priming [201]. Furthermore, patients with LTBI show superior NK cell mediated cytotoxicity, associated with increased levels of binding to Fc\u0263RIII, driving NK cell activation [32, 202].

In another study, no patients with active TB made protective antibody responses, whereas a subset of patients with LTBI and HCWs had antibodies capable of restricting M. tuberculosis growth [204].

The authors\u2019 conclusion of sterilising immunity was based on an absence of radiological disease and negative bacterial cultures from punch biopsies [172]. CMV is highly capable of inducing TEM cells [242\u2013244], though a neutrophil-specific transcriptional signature was found in vaccinated animals [172], suggesting a role for innate immunity. Further work to understand the protective mechanism and how this approach can be successfully translated to the clinic is underway.",

An immunological understanding of the pathogenesis of M. tuberculosis, one of the principal barriers to designing an effective vaccine, has slowly but surely been built up to the increasingly clear picture we have today. The classic dogma of the past, focussed solely on the adaptive response, has evolved into something far more complex, integrating the innate, adaptive and humoral systems. With this greater understanding, a variety of novel vaccine design strategies has been made possible. The recent M72/AS01E result gives renewed cause for optimism in this challenging field. It is critical to maintain the momentum that has been built up over the last two decades so that M. tuberculosis, a pathogen that has been with us for 3 million years [245], can finally be consigned to the same fate as smallpox.",
