Of all these patients, 11 184 cases have died worldwide [1, 3] and 1433 cases have died in Iran [1, 4]. The first COVID-19 case (i.e. the index case) in Iran was observed in the city of Qom on 19 February 2020. COVID-19 has started to spread rapidly in Qom and other neighbouring provinces, including Markazi Province, ever since. This study aimed to report the challenges and considerations of community-based preparedness at the onset of COVID-19 outbreak in a city of Iran in 2020.",

This city is located 94 km from Qom and its population is 55 000 people. A total of 353 COVID-19 cases has been detected in Qom thus far. The first COVID-19 case in Delijan was from a taxi driver who had visited Qom a few days before his diagnosis. Consequently, COVID-19 has quickly spread in this city because a large population commutes daily between the two cities. This prompted the epidemiological team of the Arak University of Medical Sciences to visit the city.",

Four of the COVID-19 patients were the medical staff of hospitals. Since only those cases with severe symptoms undergo confirmatory diagnostic tests and given that the spreading pattern in Iran is similar to that of China (the percentage of cases with severe COVID-19 were 13.8% and 6.1% critical conditions in China) [9], we expect that about 20% of the patients are severe and critical cases in Iran. Thus, given the fact that 20 patients are suffering from severe, critical COVID-19 symptoms, it can be estimated that there are at least 80 patients in Delijan with mild-to-moderate symptoms who have gone undetected and hence able to easily transfer COVID-19 to others.",

The identification of the secondary and tertiary contacts should be prioritised in control programmes. Those contacts will be encouraged to stay at home, as they will be notified that they are contacts of confirmed cases. There is an official advice on self-isolation with or without symptoms. Household members of confirmed cases are recommended to stay at home and without close contact with other healthy household members, and they are regularly followed up by health care workers. Moreover, voluntary home quarantine (self-isolation) is recommended for an asymptomatic person, when they have a high risk of exposure to the virus that causes COVID-19 (i.e. through close contact with a symptomatic person or their body fluids). The population is asked to self-isolate in the home setting to avoid contact with others in order to prevent transmission of COVID-19. The current situation of the personal protective equipment (PPE) is insufficient. There is inadequate access to PPE even for the health care workers. The health care workers without symptoms did not undergo tests regularly, and it is expected that more cases may surface among them.",
