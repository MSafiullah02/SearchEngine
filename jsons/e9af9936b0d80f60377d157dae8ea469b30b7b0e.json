            "text": "The induction of aberrant crypt foci (ACF) by irradiation of \u03b3-rays ( 60 Co), and the effect of dietary sugar beet fiber (SBF) on irradiation-induced ACF were examined. We found that abdominal irradiation of \u03b3-rays could induce ACF in the rat colon. The irradiation was performed once a week at a dose rate of 2 or 3 Gy per irradiation. Irradiation-induced ACF were observed in the colon at 10 weeks after the first irradiation at dose of 2 Gy for six times or 3 Gy for four times. Dietary SBF had no effect on the number of ACF, aberrant crypts (AC) or AC/focus induced by abdominal \u03b3-irradiation. However, an ingestion of SBF resulted in an increase in the number of these parameters in apoptosis-suppressed rats by cycloheximide (CHX). An injection of CHX suppressed irradiationinduced apoptosis of the colonic epithelial cells for at least 6 h after the irradiation. In CHX-injected rats, an ingestion of SBF significantly increased the number of ACF, AC and AC/focus compared with fiber-free fed rats at 9 weeks after the first irradiation. On the other hand, in saline-injected rats, no significant difference was found between SBF and fiber-free diets in the number of ACF, AC and AC/focus through the experimental period. These results suggest that dietary SBF may be involved in the elimination of abnormal cells from an irradiated colon through the apoptosis of colonic epithelial cells. In this study, we have shown a new method for inducing ACF by using \u03b3-rays which were not influenced by luminal contents such as bacterial enzyme, at least in the initiation stage.",

            "text": "Aberrant crypt foci (ACF) are used as biomarkers of colorectal cancer because they appear in the colorectum of rodents at an early period of carcinogenesis (1) . Aberrant crypts (AC) are a few times larger than normal crypts, occurring as an oval shape in the thickened epithelium, and are easily detectable in whole mounts of the colonic mucosa with methylene blue staining (1) . ACF look like adenoma and have high proliferative activity because the bromodeoxyuridine (2) or the proliferating cell nuclear antigen-labeling (3) index was higher in the crypt comprising ACF than in the normal crypt. In rodents exposed to chemical carcinogens, ACF and tumors develop in their colons (1, (4) (5) (6) (7) . ACF appear at an early period of colorectal carcinogenesis and in the tumor-bearing state in rats after treatment with carcinogen (8) , also in patients with sporadic and hereditary colon cancer (9) . They can therefore be considered as putative early preneoplastic lesions. On the other hand, there are complicated results that ACF formation is inhibited by oral administration of cholic acid, which promotes the formation of colonic tumors (10) (11) (12) . It is interesting to investigate the effect of dietary factors on the growth characteristics of ACF to evaluate the biological significance of ACF or to elucidate the mechanism of tumor formation thereafter.",

Rats were killed to collect their colons for ACF determination at 5 or 9 weeks after the first irradiation. In the experiment for the effects of ingestion of SBF on the irradiation-induced ACF, 32 Wistar/ST rats had been fed a fiber-free or an SBF diet from 5 days before irradiation. Three rats in every group were not irradiated and were kept as a control. The dose of irradiation was six times at 3 Gy, and the colonic ACF measurement was performed at 15 weeks after the first irradiation. In the experiment for suppression of apoptosis of colonic epithelial cells by CHX injection, rats were irradiated once and killed at 3, 6 or 9 h after the irradiation. For CHX-injection groups, CHX (1 mg/kg body wt; Sigma, St Louis, MO) was injected intraperitoneally into rats at 10-15 min before and 3 h after the irradiation. Control rats were injected with saline at the same time point. In the experiment for the influence of CHX injection and SBF ingestion on ACF induced by \u03b3-rays, 47 Wistar/ST rats were purchased. Three rats were not irradiated and were kept with fiber-free diet throughout the experimental period as a control. Forty-four rats were divided into two dietary groups (fiber-free or SBF) for 7 days after acclimatization, then irradiated three times at a dose of 3 Gy once a week (total 9 Gy).

In the experiment for the effect of CHX injection and SBF ingestion on the irradiation-induced apoptosis of colonic epithelial cells, 36 Wistar/ST rats were divided into two dietary groups (fiberfree or SBF) for 3 days after acclimatization and irradiated once, twice or three times. The dose of irradiation was 3 Gy, once (after the first irradiation), twice (after the second irradiation) or three times (after the third irradiation). All rats were injected with CHX before and after irradiation as described above. CHX was not injected after the last irradiation in this experiment, because irradiation-induced apoptotic cells using the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) method were evaluated 1 h after the irradiation in these studies. These colons were removed 1 h after every irradiation and used for morphological evaluation of apoptotic epithelial cells to confirm whether CHX injection inhibits the irradiationinduced apoptosis of the colonic epithelial cells.",

CHX injection clearly suppressed apoptosis of the colonic epithelial cells induced by irradiation at 3 h. Then, the apoptosis was gradually reduced, but the apoptosis-suppressing effect of CHX was maintained until at least 6 h after irradiation. The i.p. injections of CHX (1 mg/kg body wt) markedly inhibited apoptosis of the colonic epithelial cells. Figure 3 shows the effects of the ingestion of SBF on irradiation-induced ACF in CHX-treated rats. No significant differences in body weight and body weight gain were observed at every time point regardless of irradiation, diet and CHX injection. In CHX-injected groups, the ingestion of SBF promoted the numbers of ACF, AC and AC/focus as the duration after the irradiation increased. There was no significant effect of dietary SBF on ACF in saline-injected groups. At 9 weeks after the first irradiation, a significantly large number of ACF and AC/focus was observed by CHX injection in comparison with the saline-injected control group in SBF-fed rats. In fiber-free rats, there was no significant change in the numbers of ACF, AC and AC/focus through the experimental period, regardless of CHX injection. Effect of CHX injection and SBF ingestion on the irradiationinduced apoptosis of colonic epithelial cells APO-LI was at a constantly low level (2.7-3.2%) at 1 h after each irradiation, and no significant change of APO-LI was observed in this experiment (Table V) . In our preliminary results, APO-LI after the second irradiation in the SBF group (15.9 \u03ee 0.3) was significantly larger than in the fiber-free group (14.5 \u03ee 0.3) (P \u03fd 0.05) in CHX-untreated condition. CHX injection therefore has an inhibitory effect on the apoptosis of colonic epithelial cells. The crypt cell number tended to be larger as the number of irradiations increases but it did not differ between the dietary groups.",

            "text": "We have shown that low doses (2 or 3 Gy) and frequent irradiations of \u03b3-rays induce ACF in the rat colon. In many studies, the carcinogen is injected at least a few times every week (16) . In this study, ACF parameters tended to increase as the dose per week increased and as sampling time was delayed after the first irradiation if total doses were the same (Table II) . The initiation of this irradiation-induced ACF may hardly be influenced by intestinal environmental factor as compared with carcinogen-induced ACF. Chemical carcinogens, for example DMH or AOM, require conversion by intestinal bacteria into a real carcinogen, methylazoxymethanol (17) , though ionizing radiation such as \u03b3-rays directly affects DNA in the intestinal epithelial cells. The ingestion of SBF as a dietary fiber had no effect on the irradiation-induced ACF in a CHX-untreated condition. Our previous result showed that dietary SBF significantly reduced DMH-induced ACF in the rat colon (15) . The difference between these results is caused by a difference in the method for inducing ACF. One possible explanation is that a reduction of carcinogen-induced ACF by SBF was due to the enhancement of defecation and the excretion of carcinogen. To explain this difference, we must examine how dietary SBF influences ACF generation or development. In this connection, it is also interesting to investigate the effects of dietary cholic acid against irradiation-induced ACF. Comparing responses with dietary factors between the irradiation-and carcinogen-induced ACF will lead to useful information on the effect of dietary factors on the formation of ACF.",

We have shown that the administration of anti-asialo GM1 increased the number of DMH-induced ACF in the rat colon (15, 21) .

The elimination of abnormal cells by apoptosis may lower the frequency of ACF and tumors thereafter. CHX was used as an inhibitor of apoptosis (27, 28) . Our preliminary experiment showed that this dose of CHX (1 mg/kg body wt) almost completely suppressed the irradiation-induced apoptosis of the colonic epithelial cells a few hours after the irradiation. We then investigated the effect of CHX injection and/or SBF ingestion on irradiation-induced ACF. Interestingly, dietary SBF clearly increased irradiation-induced ACF in the apoptosis-inhibiting condition (Figure 3 ). We confirmed that apoptosis of the colonic epithelial cells was inhibited (2-3%) by the CHX-injection, even in SBF-fed rats. We also showed that SBF ingestion increased irradiation-induced apoptosis. These results demonstrated that apoptosis after irradiation is involved in the generation of ACF by ionizing irradiation. Mechanisms associated with increasing ACF by SBF were unknown. Many organic acids have appeared as products of the fermentation after the ingestion of dietary fibers (29, 30) . In the previous report, the ingestion of SBF significantly increases the concentration of short chain fatty acids, especially butyrate in cecal contents (31) . This is easily used as an energy source (32, 33) , it induces mucosal proliferation (34) and is a potent apoptosis-inducer against some cell lines originated from colorectal cancers (35, 36) . It was uncertain if butyrate acted as an apoptosis-inducing reagent in this study.",
