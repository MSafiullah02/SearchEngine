            "text": "Recent studies have demonstrated that therapies targeting the innate immune system have the potential to provide transient, non-specific protection from a variety of infectious organisms; however, the potential of enhancing the efficacy of such treatments using nano-scale delivery platforms requires more in depth evaluation. As such, we employed a nanolipoprotein (NLP) platform to enhance the efficacy of innate immune agonists. Here, we demonstrate that the synthetic Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonists monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA) and CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG) can be readily incorporated into NLPs. Conjugation of MPLA and CpG to NLPs (MPLA:NLP and CpG:NLP, respectively) significantly enhanced their immunostimulatory profiles both in vitro and in vivo compared to administration of agonists alone, as evidenced by significant increases in cytokine production, cell surface expression of activation markers, and upregulation of immunoregulatory genes. Importantly, enhancement of cytokine production by agonist conjugation to NLPs was also observed in primary human dendritic cells. Furthermore, BALB/c mice pretreated with CpG:NLP constructs survived a lethal influenza challenge whereas pretreatment with CpG alone had no effect on survival.",

            "text": "Select classes of pathogenic organisms pose significant threats to public health due to the high levels of morbidity and mortality induced by very low infectious doses and their ease of transmissibility by aerosol [1] . For many of these organisms, efficacious therapies are not available or not optimal in the event of a bioterror attack or acute disease emergence. Vaccines, long considered the gold standard medical countermeasure for disease prevention, may not be available, or not suitable for widespread administration to the general public due to safety concerns [2] . Similarly, antimicrobial compounds may be insufficient to counter a wide range of unknown, deliberately altered, or drug-resistant pathogens and can potentially lead to resistance. As such, development of innovative approaches that allow for rapid responses to traditional and emerging pathogens is paramount. Recently, targeting the innate immune system to counter infection has been gaining attention as a therapeutic strategy [3e5] . The innate immune system has evolved over millennia to function immediately and non-specifically upon encountering pathogens [6] , thus modulation of a single innate host resistance mechanism has the potential to offer broadspectrum efficacy independent of pathogen identity. Furthermore, therapeutics targeting innate immunity would be less likely to promote the development of resistance, as the pathogen itself is not directly targeted.",

TLRs play a key role in the early steps of the immune response to infection, and robust TLR activation is critical for the downstream induction of a sustained adaptive immune response and pathogen clearance [9] . Importantly, the well-described association of TLRs with myriad infections underscores their importance as therapeutic targets and current research efforts are focused on clinically translating our understanding of TLRs and innate immunity [10e12] . Vaccine adjuvants are perhaps the most extensively explored application for TLR agonists, although there have been recent efforts exploring the use of TLR monotherapy to enhance host resistance to infection by a variety of pathogens [13e25] . However, there are significant limitations to the effectiveness of TLR agonists as stand-alone therapeutics, including marginal and short-lived protection, thus limiting their utility in both pre-and post-exposure scenarios. Furthermore, the dose required to afford protection in several of these studies was significantly higher than doses typically coadministered in combination with subunit antigens for vaccine applications [26] , potentially raising toxicity concerns. Hence, strategies to improve the therapeutic index of TLR agonists in vivo are urgently needed.",

Although the functional indicator is ultimately heightened adaptive immune responses, nanoparticlemediated enhancement of vaccine immunogenicity is likely due, at least in part, to heightened innate immune responses [28e31]. Indeed, several recent studies have demonstrated the prostimulatory effects of diverse nanoparticles on innate immune responses in vitro and in vivo [32e37] . In this study, we aimed to utilize nanolipoprotein particles (NLPs) to improve the efficacy of innate immune targeting therapeutics. NLPs are discoidal, nanometer-sized particles comprised of self-assembled phospholipid membranes and apolipoproteins [38, 39] . Previously, we have described NLPs as a flexible vaccine platform for the co-localized administration of protein antigens and synthetic TLR agonists monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA) and CpG oligodeoxynucleotides (CpG) [40] . Immunization with antigen:agonist:NLP complexes containing either influenza hemagglutinin or Yersinia pestis LcrV antigens and CpG or MPLA resulted in significantly higher antibody titers in mice against both antigens versus co-administration of antigens and agonists without NLP conjugation. Thus, NLPs have demonstrated effectiveness as a compatible platform for immune modulation strategies and have been used previously in other in vivo applications [41e44], supporting their broad utility.",

Briefly, for the MPLA:NLP assembly, the appropriate amount of chloroform-solubilized Ni-Lipid (35 mol%), DOPC (60e64.5 mol%) and MPLA (0.5e5 mol%) were determined prior to the experiment and added to a glass reaction vial. Chloroform was then removed using a stream of N 2 under agitation to form a thin lipid film. Lipids were solubilized in PBS buffer (137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 8 mM Na 2 HPO 4 and 2 mM KH 2 PO 4 ) using 40 mM sodium cholate. ApoE422k was added to the solubilized lipid suspension to a final lipid:apoE422k ratio of 80:1 (typically 150 mM apoE422k was used in the final assembly volume). For the CpG:NLP assembly, the lipid constituents were prepared as described above. CpG (hydrated from a lyophilized state using pyrogen-free water) was added to the solubilized lipid together with the apoE422K. Assemblies were dialyzed overnight against PBS to remove cholate and then filtered through a 0.22 mm spin filter to remove any large particulate matter. Samples were subsequently analyzed and purified by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) (Superdex 200 pg, HiLoad 16/600 column, GE Healthcare, Piscataway, NJ) in PBS buffer (1.0 ml/min flow rate). The apoE422k concentration in the NLP samples was determined using the Advanced Protein Assay Reagent (Cytoskeleton Inc., Denver, CO), using BSA as the standard. Free MPLA was prepared by first solubilizing MPLA in powder form in 100% DMSO at a concentration of 10 mg/ml. The solution was then diluted to 1 mg/ml in water and sonicated with a tip sonicator (Branson Sonifer, Model 250, Branson Ultrasonics, Danbury, CT) at the highest power until the suspension reached clarity. All buffers, eppendorf tubes and vials used during the assembly process were endotoxin-free. It is worth nothing that lipids containing a nickel chelating head group (Ni-Lipid) were included in all NLP assembly reactions, and while the NLPs generated for this study did not require the Ni functional group, we wanted to ensure that results obtained from this study would be applicable to ongoing NLP-based vaccine studies, in which a protein antigen is attached via the Ni-His tag interaction [40] . Additionally, a long-term objective of the approach described herein is to examine the effects of multiple immune modulators on a single NLP; thus, the Ni-Lipid was included in order to evaluate NLPs equipped for the attachment of His-tagged adjuvants, such as His-tagged flagellin [45] .",

The fluorescence of the sample was then measured at an excitation and emission wavelength of 480 nm and 520 nm, respectively. Since the standards were not traditional ssDNA (CpG contains a phosphorothiolated back bone), the standard curve was sigmoidal rather than linear. Therefore, the standard curve was established by fitting the standards to a sigmoidal function, which was used to calculate the CpG concentration in the CpG:NLP. It is worth noting only fluorescence values that were within the sloping region of the sigmoidal function were used to calculate CpG concentrations since values in the saturation region were more prone to error. To ensure that the NLP itself did not affect the fluorescence emission of the Quant-iT OliGreen dye, the fluorescence values of free CpG standards and CpG standards in the presence of NLPs were compared, and no significant differences were observed. The number of CpG molecules per NLP was then calculated using the experimentally determined apoE422k protein concentration while assuming that each NLP contains 6 apoE422k proteins [39] .

Incorporation into the NLPs was monitored by HPLC using an evaporative light scattering detector. HPLC chromatograms of the MPLA peak at increasing MPLA to NLP ratios are shown in Fig. 1B . As expected, an increase in the MPLA peak intensity was observed with an increase in the MPLA to NLP ratio.

The experimental values closely follow the theoretical plot (i.e. all MPLA in the reaction is incorporated into the NLP) up to a mole ratio of w3. At higher ratios, the actual incorporation values deviate from the theoretical values, indicating a decrease in the efficiency of MPLA incorporation at higher ratios. Thus, for all subsequent experiments NLPs were assembled at an MPLA to NLP molar ratio of 3. Similar titration assembly reactions were performed with CpG and incorporation was evaluated by size exclusion chromatography (SEC) (Fig. 1E ). NLPs were assembled at CpG to NLP molar ratios ranging from 1 to 32. Since CpG (retention time (t R ) 13.5 min) is significantly smaller than the NLP (t R 9 min), unincorporated CpG was readily resolved from the NLP by SEC. In the SEC analysis, a decrease in the NLP t R (shifted from 9 min down to 8 min) and an increase in the peak intensity was observed, indicative of CpG incorporation. The shift in retention time was expected since incorporation of many larger compounds into the NLP, including CpG, should increase the overall stokes diameter of the NLP [44] . In addition, the increase in absorbance at 280 nm was expected with CpG incorporation due to the inherent absorbance of CpG at 280 nm. Therefore, these two trends indicate successful incorporation of CpG. At CpG to NLP ratios of 16 and higher, a peak corresponding to unincorporated CpG was observed (t R 13.5 min) in addition to the CpG:NLP construct. To quantitatively measure incorporation efficiency, CpG:NLPs were purified by SEC. The CpG to NLP ratios in the SEC-purified constructs were plotted as a function of the initial CpG to NLP ratio that was used in the assembly reaction (CpG:NLP input, Fig. 1F ). Based on this analysis, the incorporated CpG in the assembled particle tracked very closely with the theoretical value up to a ratio of approximately 8 (i.e. all CpG added to the assembly was incorporated into the NLP). The trend deviated substantially from the theoretical values at ratios higher than 10, and very little additional CpG was incorporated in the NLP at CpG to NLP input ratios above 20. Thus, to maximize CpG incorporation into the NLP while minimizing loss of unincorporated CpG, CpG:NLPs were assembled at a CpG to NLP ratio of 20 for all subsequent experiments. These combined results demonstrate successful incorporation of both CpG and MPLA into the NLP and accurate quantitation of CpG and MPLA concentrations.",

The mouse antibacterial response array (SABiosciences), which simultaneously measures the expression of 84 genes previously demonstrated to be involved in innate responses to bacterial infections, was used to analyze gene expression in the spleen 30 min and 2 h post-IP injection. Changes in gene expression were minimal after 30 min (data not shown). However, robust changes in the levels of gene expression in a number of key genes were detected (Fig. 5 ) after 2 h. Interestingly, scatterplot analysis indicated that the numbers of genes exhibiting at least a AE2-fold regulation were more similar among the NLP, CpG:NLP and MPLA:NLP groups than either CpG:NLP or MPLA:NLP with their corresponding free agonist controls (Fig. 5A ). Furthermore, the magnitude of those changes was consistently much higher among the NLP, CpG:NLP and MPLA:NLP groups than either free CpG or MPLA. The levels of expression of those genes exhibiting at least a AE2-fold regulation are summarized in Fig. 5B (for a full summary of the changes in gene expression for all 84 genes, see Supplemental Table 1 ). Both CpG:NLP and MPLA:NLP induced much higher levels of expression of a number of genes than either CpG or MPLA alone (Fig. 5B) . Included in this set are many genes encoding cytokines and chemokines, as well as several genes involved in TLR and NF-kB signaling pathways. Surprisingly, the NLP alone also induced high levels of expression of many of the same genes, in some cases equal or almost equal to levels induced by either CpG:NLP or MPLA:NLP ( Fig. 5B ; Supplemental Table 1 ). Indeed, based on the patterns of gene expression, it appears that the majority of the gene upregulation induced by CpG:NLP and MPLA:NLP could be attributed to the NLP rather than CpG or MPLA. These data suggest that the NLP itself is immunostimulatory at the doses examined in these studies and may explain, in part, the ability of the NLP to augment the immunostimulatory profiles of CpG and MPLA in vivo.",

CpG-Quasar 670:NLP and free CpG-Quasar 670 were injected into mice and spleens were harvested 4, 24, 48 and 72 h post-injection and analyzed for the presence of CpG-Quasar 670 (Fig. 6) . Conjugation of CpG-Quasar 670 to the NLP resulted in a significant increase in the percentage of splenocytes that were Quasar 670 positive by 4 h (average 60% versus 35%, Fig. 6A ). Increases in the percentage of CpG positive splenocytes with NLP conjugation were even more dramatic at later time points, with greater than 3-fold more splenocytes exhibiting Quasar 670 fluorescence at 24, 48 and 72 h postinjection when the labeled CpG was conjugated to the NLP. Uptake by specific cell types was determined by antibody staining (Fig. 6BeD) . Uptake by macrophages and dendritic cells was similar at the 4-h time point, but significant differences emerged at later time points (Fig. 6BeD) . These data suggest that conjugation to NLPs may enhance trafficking of CpG to the spleen, retention of CpG at later time points, and/or uptake of CpG on a per cell basis, or a combination of all three scenarios. Enhancement of uptake by conjugation to NLPs was confirmed using purified splenocyte populations ex vivo. Splenocytes were sorted into CD11c \u00fe and CD11b \u00fe populations and incubated with CpG-Quasar 670, either free or conjugated to NLPs, for 1 h and then analyzed by flow cytometry. NLP conjugation resulted in significant enhancement in the amount of CpG-Quasar 670 taken up by both cell populations, as measured by mean fluorescence intensity of the Quasar 670 signal (Fig. 6E and F) . While further experiments are needed to fully elaborate the mechanisms by which NLPs may alter biodistribution and retention of agonists in vivo, these results indicate that conjugation to the NLP enhances uptake of CpG into cells. It is worth noting that these experiments were only performed with CpG:NLPs because MPLA is not amenable to labeling with a fluorescent dye; however, we hypothesize that a similar trend would likely be observed for MPLA:NLPs as this effect was due to delivery via the NLP platform.",

Pathogens labeled as having highest risk to national security and public safety (NIAID Category A pathogens) pose significant challenges, as viable therapeutic options are either not available or not optimal to treat na\u00efve populations in the event of a widespread outbreak or deliberate release. In addition, there is a continual threat of the emergence of new pathogens against which no therapeutics exist, such as the coronaviruses responsible for the respiratory syndromes SARS and MERS [49] , or of newly recombinant pathogenic strains of influenza yet to be encountered. Therefore, in the event of an intentional release or pandemic outbreak caused by such a pathogen, those individuals in the vicinity of the outbreak would be at risk of exposure with limited treatment options. An innate immune targeting therapeutic, such as the TLR agonist:NLP complexes described here, could be employed prophylactically in such an event to enable exposed individuals to build sufficient transient immunity to survive Fig. 7 . Conjugation of TLR agonists to NLPs enhances cytokine production by human dendritic cells. PBMCs were purified from blood collected from healthy donors and stimulated for 4 h with CpG:NLP, MPLA:NLP, CpG or MPLA. Cells were then analyzed by flow cytometry for cytokine production.

HLA-DR is used to distinguish dendritic cells from basophils. mDCs and pDCs were distinguished by the expression of CD11c and CD123 respectively.

There is precedent for targeting innate immunity as a prophylactic countermeasure against biothreat agents, as CpG has previously been shown to be protective in mice against Francisella tularensis and Burkholderia pseudomallei [17, 24, 25] , and synthetic TLR4 agonists have been shown to be protective in mice against F. tularensis and Y. pestis [13e15]. However, the protection afforded in these studies was variable, with some demonstrating only marginally better survival than untreated control animals. In our study, mice that were pretreated with CpG as free agonists were not afforded any level of protection against influenza challenge whereas all mice that received CpG:NLP complexes survived infection. This suggests that administering TLR agonists complexed to a particle improves the therapeutic index of the agonists, and raises the intriguing possibility that the incomplete protection afforded in earlier studies may be improved upon by administration of TLR agonists-particulate complexes as opposed to free agonists alone.",

            "text": "While particulate delivery systems, mainly in the form of aluminum salts (alum), have been used for over a century, the mechanisms behind their enhancement of vaccine immunogenicity have only recently begun to be unraveled. To date, many varied types of synthetic micro and nanoparticles have been explored as vaccine platforms, and numerous studies have documented their wide range of effects on innate immune responses (extensively reviewed in Ref. [50] ). Recent studies have demonstrated that alum in various forms, as well poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) microparticles, can activate the NLRP3 inflammasome [35e37,51] . Reports have differed on the requirements and outcomes of inflammasome activation, and while the requirement for inflammasome activation in the subsequent induction of adaptive responses is unclear, activation of various aspects of innate immunity by particulate adjuvants is well established. Our data provide further evidence for nanoparticle-mediated activation of innate immune responses. Injection of animals with NLPs without agonists resulted in robust changes in the expression levels of genes encoding proteins involved in TLR/NLR signaling, cytokine and chemokine signaling, as well as other innate immune pathways (Fig. 5) , suggesting the particle itself is immunostimulatory. While we did not look at activation of the inflammasome directly, genes related to inflammasome activation were upregulated following NLP injection, including Il1b and Nlrp3 (Fig. 5B) . Interestingly, another recent study demonstrated that in vitro treatment of DCs with poly(gglutamic acid) particles induced expression of many genes involved in TLR signaling [31] , including many of the same genes for cytokines and signal transduction molecules found to be expressed in response to NLP treatment in our study. Thus, there is precedent for robust changes in the expression of immunostimulatory genes following nanoparticle administration. What remains to be elucidated is how the NLP-induced changes in gene expression relate to downstream immune responses (i.e. production of cytokines and surface expression of activation markers on APCs). Whereas large changes in gene expression were detected in the spleen following IP administration of NLPs, proinflammatory cytokine levels in the serum were minimal (Fig. 4A) and no increase was observed in the surface expression of activation markers on splenic APCs (Fig. 4B) . Moreover, the changes in gene expression induced by CpG:NLPs and MPLA:NLPs were comparable to NLPs alone, yet high levels of serum cytokines and robust upregulation of activation markers were observed following administration of both agonist:NLP complexes. Further work is required to understand the impact of these NLP-dependent transcriptional changes, and whether these responses are short lived, or translate into as of now unknown cellular outputs that have significant physiological consequences at the cellular and organismal level when TLR agonists are present in the NLPs.",

            "text": "Our data clearly demonstrate that conjugation to NLPs enhances innate immune responses to TLR agonists and further investigation will be necessary to elucidate the mechanism/s responsible for this enhancement. One possible method of enhancement could be related to the clustering together of multiple molecules of MPLA or CpG. When a cell encounters one NLP it is effectively encountering 3 molecules of MPLA or 9 molecules of CpG ( Fig. 1C and F) . This increase in local concentration of agonists may result in higher levels of activation on a per cell basis. Furthermore, our data demonstrate that NLPs enhance uptake of CpG into macrophages and dendritic cells ( Fig. 6E and F) , which may result in increased activation levels as the receptor for CpG (TLR9) is intracellular. RT-PCR analysis of immunoregulatory genes suggests that the NLP particles themselves may be an innate immune agonist, and therefore the enhancement could in part be due to a synergistic effect of simultaneous delivery of multiple agonists. The in vivo response to agonist:NLP constructs may be further augmented by enhanced trafficking of agonists to secondary lymphoid organs. Our data demonstrating higher percentages of splenocytes positive for CpG-Quasar 670 upon injection with CpG-Quasar 670:NLP versus CpG-Quasar 670 alone is likely due, in part, to the enhancement in uptake promoted by NLP conjugation. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that NLP conjugation also enhances trafficking of CpG to the spleen. Furthermore, conjugation to NLPs may result in retention of CpG in the spleen for longer periods of time. This is an interesting hypothesis given that the most significant differences in percent CpG-670 \u00fe total splenocytes, macrophages and dendritic cells were seen at 24 and 48 h post injection (Fig. 6AeD) . Likewise, further investigation is also needed to understand the mechanisms by which CpG:NLP complexes protect against lethal influenza challenge. Prophylactic initiation of innate immunity as a means of preventing or ameliorating disease caused by viral infection can be postulated to be effective by several means, including the induction of type I interferon-dependent antiviral mechanisms, activation of NK cells and stimulation of Th1 type-antiviral T cell responses [52] . The CpG used in these experiments was of the B class, therefore not likely to elicit large amounts of IFN-a [53] . Thus, investigation into the effects on anti-viral T cell and NK cell responses in the lungs will be key to understanding the mechanisms behind CpG:NLP mediated protection against influenza infection. The goal of this study was to demonstrate that NLP conjugation enhances the efficacy of innate immune activation by TLR agonists and further demonstrate the utility of the NLP platform for immune modulation strategies. While transient activation of innate immune responses in vivo may be useful in certain scenarios and for specific populations [3] , we recognize that this approach could also potentially drive adverse reactions in healthy human populations. While our data demonstrate the potential utility of NLP-based innate immune modulation, inbred mice do not represent the heterogeneity present in the human population. Specifically, mouse models cannot capture the complexity present in humans with respect to genetic background, previous exposures to infectious agents as well as the composition of an individual's microbiota [54] . All of these factors would likely result in a heterogeneous lymphocyte population where TLR stimulation could have pleiotropic effects that would be largely unpredictable. Therefore, translation to a clinical setting would require further refinement and a systematic optimization of the agonist:NLP to minimize the potential for any deleterious side effects.",

            "text": "In this study, we investigated the impact of TLR agonist:NLP complexes on innate immune responses in vitro and in vivo. We demonstrated that CpG and MPLA can be readily incorporated and accurately quantified within the NLP platform. Administration of CpG:NLP and MPLA:NLP versus the administration of free CpG and MPLA resulted in significant enhancement of multiple hallmarks of innate immune activation, including cytokine production, surface expression of activation markers, and transcriptional changes of immunoregulatory genes. Importantly, NLP conjugation enhanced cytokine production in response to both agonists not only in mice, but also in primary human dendritic cells. Finally, utilizing a mouse model of influenza, we demonstrate that prophylactic administration of CpG:NLP complexes provided complete protection from an otherwise lethal infection. The efficacy of CpG:NLP complexes at ameliorating infection, coupled with the observation that CpG:NLP and MPLA:NLP enhance innate immune responses not only in the murine system but also within primary human dendritic cells, indicate potential for the future clinical applications of the NLP platform as an innate immune modulator.",
