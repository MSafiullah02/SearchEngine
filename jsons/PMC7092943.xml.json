Due to the extra sequences derived from pET28b, the full-length SARS-CoV 3CLpro was expressed as a 39.5 kDa protein containing His6-tag at both the N-terminus and the C-terminus. However, it was realized that the C-terminal sequences of SARS-CoV 3CLpro, VTFQ, while in connection with the 11 amino acid residues of vector pET28b, AAALEHHHHHH, could actually form a consensus cutting site for SARS-CoV 3CLpro, VTFQ\u2193AAA. The resulting protein would then be 37.4 kDa instead of 39.5 kDa (Fig. 1A). Thus, the results clearly suggest that the SARS-CoV 3CLpro expressed possesses cis-cleavage activity.",

The inhibitory effects of two serine protease inhibitors, TLCK and TPCK, and two cysteine protease inhibitors, NEM and E-64, were tested in this FRET-based assay. Data shown in Fig. 3\ndemonstrate that both serine protease inhibitors reduced the enzymatic activity of SARS-CoV 3CLpro in a dose-dependent manner. However, the results for the two cysteine protease inhibitors were inconsistent: while NEM had significant inhibitory effects on SARS-CoV 3CLpro, E-64 did not inhibit it at all. The data support the idea that SARS-CoV 3CLpro works following a general base mechanism like the serine proteases, but not following a thiolate\u2013imidazolium ion pair catalytic mechanism like the papain protease [16]. However, NEM probably inhibits the proteolytic activity of SARS-CoV 3CLpro via directly blocking the catalytic Cys145 residue, due to its ability to bind stoichiometrically to the sulfhydryl (SH) group of cysteine in the cysteine protease family.",

The kinetic studies showed that the N-terminal autocleavage site of SARS-CoV 3CLpro was a better substrate than the C-terminal autocleavage site in the trans-cleavage assay. Recently, Fan et al. [17] have systematically analyzed the substrate specificity of SARS-CoV 3CLpro and found that the P2 position of the substrate required a large hydrophobic residue for the hydrophobic interaction between the P2 position and the S2 pocket of the enzyme, as indicated by the crystal structure [2], [4]. Although Phe, Val, and Met are tolerant at P2 for SARS-CoV 3CLpro\n[18], the mutation of Leu-P2 to other hydrophobic residues decreases the reaction activity [17]. Since 1NC has a Leu at the P2 position and 2NC has a Phe, this may explain why 2NC was cleaved less efficiently than 1NC by SARS-CoV 3CLpro.",

            "text": "Our deletion data (Fig. 2) and antibody blocking data (Fig. 4) indicate that both the N-terminal 7 amino acids and the domain III are important for the enzymatic activity of SARS-CoV 3CLpro. Similar conclusion has also been reached for the 3CLpro of TGEV [4]. Previous crystal structure data have attributed this importance to the dimerization function mediated by these two domains [3], [4], [8], [12]. However, a recent study by Chen et al. reported that the N-terminal seven amino acids of SARS-CoV 3CLpro were not required for enzyme dimerization. Instead, they proposed that the N-terminus-deleted mutant had a conformation that reduced the size of the binding pocket, thus creating unfavorable conditions for substrate binding [19]. The discrepancy about the roles of the N-terminal seven amino acid residues is not completely resolved at this moment and it needs to be further investigated by different analytical methods. However, no matter what function the N-terminal domain may play, it is definitely important for the proteolytic activity of SARS-CoV 3CLpro, as demonstrated by our activity assay.",
