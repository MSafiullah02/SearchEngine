Earlier, morphological traits were used for assessing similarities between species and building phylogenetic trees. Presently, phylogenetics relies on information extracted from genetic material such as deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), ribonucleic acid (RNA) or protein sequences [2] . Methods used for phylogenetic inference have changed drastically during the past two decades: from alignment-based to alignment-free methods [3] .

The species can be expressed as DNA strings which are formed by combining four nucleotides A, T, C and G (A-adenine, T-thymine, C-cytosine and G-guanine). In literature, various string processing algorithms are reported which can quickly analyse these DNA and RNA sequences and build a phylogeny of sequences or species based on their similarity and dissimilarity. A high similarity among two sequences usually implies significant functional or structural likeliness, and these sequences are closely related in the phylogenetic tree. To get more precise information about the extent of similarity to some other sequence stored in a database, we must be able to compare sequences quickly with a set of sequences. For this, we need to perform the multiple sequence comparison. Dynamic programming concepts facilitate this comparison using alignment methods, but it involves more computation. Moreover, the iterative computational steps limit its utility for long length sequences [3] . Alignment-free methods overcome this limitation as they follow alternative metrics like word frequency or sequence entropy for finding similarity between sequences.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 1157, "end": 1160, "text": "[3]", "ref_id": "BIBREF2"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Literature Review"}, {"text": "Phylogenetic tree generation consists of sequence alignment where the resulting tree reveals how alignment can influence the tree formation. Alignment-based methodologies are probably the most widely used tools in sequence analysis problems [4] . They consist of arranging two sequences: one on the top of another to highlight their common symbols and substrings. An alignment method is based on alignment parameters including insertion, deletions and gaps which play a pivotal role in the construction of the phylogenetic tree. A phylogenetic tree is formed as an outcome of sequence analysis performed on the DNA or RNA strings [5] . Sequence comparison reveals the patterns of shared history between species, helping in the prediction of ancestral states. The comparison of sequences also helps in understanding the biology of living organisms which is required to find similarity and relationship among species.

Some computationally intensive multiple alignment methods align sequences strictly based on the order in which they receive them. Multiple sequence alignment methods emphasize that more closely related sequences should be aligned first. In cases of sequences being less related to one another, however, sharing a common ancestor may be clustered separately [11] . This implies that they can be more accurately aligned, but may result in incorrect phylogeny. Alignment can provide an optimized tree if a recursive approach is followed; however, this will increase the complexity of the problem. If the differences among the lengths of sequences are very high, the alignment performance significantly impacts tree generation. The use of dynamic programming in alignment makes computation more complicated, and iterative steps limit their utility for large datasets. Therefore, consistent efforts have been made in developing and improving multiple sequence alignment methods for supporting variable length sequences with high accuracy and also for aligning a larger number of sequences simultaneously.
