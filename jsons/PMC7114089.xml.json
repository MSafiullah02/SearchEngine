They are endemic and prevalent also in the Norwegian dairy herd (Gulliksen et al., 2009; Klem et al., 2014a). BCV causes respiratory disease, calf diarrhea and winter dysentery (contagious diarrhea in adult cattle) (Boileau and Kapil, 2010). BRSV causes respiratory disease mostly in young animals but can affect animals of all ages, and is a common cause of respiratory outbreaks in Norway (Larsen, 2000; Klem et al., 2014a). Consequences of these infections are herd health problems, reduced animal welfare and increased use of antibiotics due to secondary bacterial infections (Larsen, 2000; Valarcher and Taylor, 2007; Boileau and Kapil, 2010). Therapy costs and reduced production entails considerable financial loss for the farmer, and contributes to a present focus in Nordic countries on how to limit the spread of these viruses in the cattle population.",

This prompted the need for an easy and cost-effective way to screen dairy herds for a herd level diagnosis for BRSV and BCV. The initial screening in the control program was conducted using bulk tank milk samples (BTM). There are already commercially available indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) widely used in routine diagnostics and research in the Nordic countries (SVANOVIR\u00ae BRSV-Ab and SVANOVIR\u00ae BCV-Ab) (Tr\u00e5v\u00e9n et al., 1999; Klem et al., 2014b; Toftaker et al., 2016). However, in order to optimize cost-effectiveness of the control program, the development of a new multiplex antibody ELISA was initiated (MVD-Enferplex BCV/BRSV multiplex). The new test allowed screening for both viruses by the use of a single test.",

The true antibody status of each test subject can be determined in two ways: By use of a perfect reference test, or based on populations with known status. However, a perfect reference test (often termed a \u201cgold standard\u201d) is rarely available and for endemic diseases, which is the case for BRSV and BCV in Norway, no reference population with complete certainty regarding disease or disease freedom exists. Consequently, the underlying true infection status for test subjects remains unknown. Test validation studies (erroneously) assuming perfect reference tests are common, even though this has been shown to introduce bias in the estimation of accuracy parameters (Valenstein, 1990; Lijmer et al., 1999). Latent class analysis (LCA) allows for the estimation of test parameters in populations where the underlying true infection status cannot be determined (Hui and Walter, 1980). In LCA the true infection status is treated as an existing, but unknown (latent), variable and test accuracy and prevalence are parameterized according to this latent variable.",

Briefly, the antigens were deposited in a multiplex planar array as individual spots into wells of 96 well microtiter plates to produce arrays of antigens. Samples were diluted 1:3 into sample dilution buffer and mixed before added to the well and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 60 min with agitation. After washing procedures, the detection antibody diluted in conjugate buffer was added and plates were incubated (37 \u00b0C for 60 min with agitation) before new washing. Finally, the chemiluminescent substrate was added. Relative light units (RLU) were captured (45 s exposure) immediately, using Quansys biosciences imaging system, and data was extracted using Quansys Q view software (v 1.5.4.7). Antigens were combined in a parallel reading, i.e. the test was considered positive when the RLU-value of at least one antigen was above the applied cut-off.

This was done for both viruses. When later choosing which cut-off values to assess, changing the cut-off for the most influential antigen for each virus was prioritized. We used an explorative approach to selecting cut-off values, and several different cut-off values were tried for the most influential antigen (Fig. 1\n).

We ran the analyses assuming CID between tests; however, we also explored the consequences of relaxing this assumption as explained below. For the CID-models, parameters were estimated for several cut-off values (Fig. 1). Models were fit using Bayesian LCA in the OpenBugs version 3.2.1 rev 781 software. We used non-informative priors in the shape of uniform distributions on the interval between zero and one, modelled using the beta (1, 1) distribution for test properties and sub-population prevalence in all analyses. Models were run with 20,000 iterations, of which 10,000 were used as burn in and discarded. Convergence of the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) chains were assessed by visual inspection of history plots, time-series plots and Gelman-Rubin diagnostic plots using three sample chains with different initial values, as suggested by Toft et al.

This is the first study evaluating the MVD-Enferplex BRSV/BCV multiplex. The present study is also the first to present test parameters for the SVANOVIR\u00ae BRSV-Ab and SVANOVIR\u00ae BCV-Ab on BTM. The BRSV multiplex showed a somewhat lower Se, but a much higher Sp than the BRSV ELISA at the recommended cut-off values. However, when we increased the cut-off of the BRSV ELISA to sample positive >50 PP, this resulted in a large increase in Sp without a notable decrease in Se, as shown in Table 3. Our results therefore suggest that a higher cut-off than recommended by the manufacturer might be appropriate when using the SVANOVIR\u00ae BRSV-Ab on BTM. For BCV, the specificity of the multiplex was notably lower than the BCV ELISA at the recommended cut-off when using all three antigens. However, when using the BCV-A antigen only, the Sp improved without the cost of reduced Se, and the test performance was then similar to the BCV ELISA. This implies that the extra antigens are adding false positive samples, hence reducing Sp. Overall; the two tests in this study both showed good performance for detection of both BRSV and BCV antibodies. A possible benefit of choosing the multiplex therefore lies in enabling screening for both agents simultaneously as this will reduce screening costs. As the multiplex evaluated in the present study is a new test, there were no relevant studies we could compare estimates to. However, the multiplex technology has been shown useful for bovine tuberculosis in cattle and goats (Clegg et al., 2011; O\u2019Brien et al., 2017). The parameter estimates provided by the manufacturer for the SVANOVIR\u00ae BCV-Ab are based on data from a study in which 91 serum samples were analyzed using both the ELISA and a virus neutralization test (VNT) (Alenius et al., 1991). The estimates, Se of 84.6% and Sp of 100%, were calculated using VNT as gold standard. For the SVANOVIR\u00ae BRSV-Ab, the Se (94%) and Sp (100%) were calculated in a study comparing the test results to another ELISA in 151 serum samples. Thus, test estimates were relative to the other ELISA (Elvander et al., 1995). Results from the former studies are not comparable to the present study due to different sample material (serum vs. BTM). Even so, it is important to note that in studies assuming a perfect reference test the estimated Se and Sp of the index test will never exceed those of the gold standard, thus the higher Se of both the BRSV and BCV ELISA found in our study was not unexpected.",

Whenever the cut-off is changed this could entail a change in the definition of the latent condition and change the number of true positive and true negative herds. There was relatively little variation in the Se and Sp estimates of the BRSV- and BCV ELISA across the different cut-off values explored, and the change in estimates of true prevalence was minor. The tests generally agreed on the proportion of positive herds indicating that tests had good agreement on the underlying target condition. The explorative approach to choosing cut-offs is a potential weakness of the current study; however, the different scenarios provide examples of expected performance for different cut-offs and do not represent an optimization of the diagnostic tests. The chosen cut-off will likely affect the number of antibody producing animals needed for a positive BTM result, and a positive correlation between within-herd prevalence and OD-value has been shown for other diseases (Muskens et al., 2011; Nekouei et al., 2015). Because the typical Norwegian dairy herd is small (mean herd size 25.7) (Anon., 2015) compared to most other developed countries, this might influence the generalizability of our results: In larger herds antibodies might be diluted in the bulk tank, and hence cause the test Se to decrease. However, larger herds might also have more positive animals.",

            "text": "The second assumption is that the test characteristics are constant in both populations. The Norwegian dairy herd is relatively homogeneous, and the two sub-populations in this study are likely similar in terms of breeds and production systems. A potential source of variation in test characteristics between sub-populations could be antigenic diversity within the Norwegian dairy herd. Findings of antigenic diversity of BCV are summarized by Saif (2010) who concludes that only a single serotype is known based on virus cross-neutralization tests, and that a high level of cross protection has been shown between respiratory and enteric isolates. For BRSV, a Norwegian study found that the current Norwegian strains of BRSV belonged to the same subgroup as other North European isolates, indicating that the within-country diversity is likely to be limited (Klem et al., 2014a). Additionally, cross-reaction is likely to be common, and has even been shown for isolates from different species (Oberst et al., 1993). Even though it seems unlikely that spatial antigenic diversity plays an important role as source of bias it cannot be excluded with complete certainty.",

            "text": "The final assumption to be met is conditional independence of tests given the disease status. Several papers argue that if tests have similar biological basis, this assumption is likely not met (Gardner et al., 2000; Branscum et al., 2005). Conditional independence between tests means that the probability of a positive (or negative) result from one test is the same regardless of the result of the other test, given the true disease state (En\u00f8e et al., 2000; Toft et al., 2005). Conditional dependence would, in terms of false positives, mean that the second test is more likely to pick up a herd as a false positive if it already tested (false) positive on the first test, for instance due to cross-reactivity with other agents. To estimate covariance between tests (\u03b3Se and \u03b3Sp) two extra degrees of freedom are needed. In a two tests, two populations scenario this results in an unidentifiable model i.e. it is not possible to estimate covariance without including prior information. No reliable prior information could be obtained for test parameters or prevalences in the present study. Another approach potentially allowing for estimation of covariance would be to include a third test: either another antibody test, or a test detecting the virus itself (e.g. a qPCR). The first option would not necessarily allow for estimation of covariance unless the third test had some underlying properties substantially different from the two other tests. Adding an antigen test might ensure conditional independence, however, it would change the underlying disease status to involve not only serological response, but also a coherent shedding of virus. We explored the consequences of conditional dependence (sensitivity analysis) by including fixed covariances as proportions of the maximum possible covariance between tests. For the BCV estimates, allowing for covariance in the latent class models had negligible effect on parameter estimates of both tests. As the Se of the BCV multiplex and the Sp of the BCV ELISA is close to one, the small effect of covariance was expected. It can be shown mathematically that test Se (Sp) are conditionally independent whenever one test has Se (Sp) = 1, see Appendix A for details. This was also the situation for BRSV-Se where the Se of the ELISA is close to 1. However, the COC-models with fixed covariances did yield changes in the estimated specificity for BRSV of both tests. This became most notable when the covariance was assumed larger than 25% of maximum. In summary, the effect of covariance was small except for BRSV-Sp for high values of covariance. It is important to note that the sensitivity analysis gives an indication of the effect of covariance if present, but does not answer whether covariance exists. Even though both tests in this study are antibody tests, they differ in the way they are designed. First, the ELISAs uses crude whole virus in the ELISA well, whereas the BRSV/BCV multiplex uses peptides and recombinant proteins. Second, the tests use different techniques for detection. The ELISAs use a chromogenic substrate and results are based on a reading of optical density, whereas the BRSV/BCV multiplex uses a chemiluminescent substrate where results are based on a reading of light emission. These differences make a violation of the conditional independence assumption less likely.",
