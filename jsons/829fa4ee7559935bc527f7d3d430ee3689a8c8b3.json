Compared to the SARS-CoV spike (S) protein, the homologous SARS-CoV-2 S protein showed a higher affinity interaction with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is thought to be the major receptor mediating the entry of the virus into the cell [11] . The SARS-CoV-2 has been reported to be harmful to lung, liver, heart, testis, bladder and kidney, where ACE2 are highly expressed [5, 8, 9, 12, 13] . Phylogenetic network analysis showed that the circulating SARS-CoV-2 is consisted of 3 types (A, B and C) and the origins and transition chains of the virus should be further validated [14] . It has been estimated that about 80% of COVID-19 patients experiencing mild symptoms (M-COVID), recover with, or even without conventional medical treatment [10] . However, the remaining 20% of patients with respiratory distress symptom may die rapidly without urgent and specialized intensive medical care, including immediate oxygen therapy, and mechanical ventilation [15, 16] . Disease stage significantly affects COVID-19 treatment and survivorship. The overall mortality rate for hospitalized patients varied from 2.3% for patients diagnosed at the early stage to 11% at the advanced stage [17] . Unfortunately, the majority of cases are diagnosed at the advanced stage due to the lack of biomarkers and medical resources at the early stage. Therefore, it is critical to develop novel approaches to estimate the disease stage for patients in order to seek appropriate treatments and allocate scarce medical resources. In addition, novel detection methods that genuinely reflect the underlying changes of molecular and biological processes of COVID-19 patients would be favorable to the understanding of SARS-CoV-2 pathogenesis.",

Patients progress into the S-COVID often face very limited treatment options [8, 9] . Imaging technology, such as CT has been widely used to diagnose the COVID-19 patients, but suffers from high cost and demand for technical expertise, which is only accessible to those who live in developed countries.

Here, we assayed human urine samples from 32 healthy donors, three M-COVID, three S-COVID patients and two COVID-19 recovery person. Our study demonstrated that urine profiling could separate the healthy control from COVID-19 patients and also tell recovery person from COVID-19. Specific proteome features for M-COVID and S-COVID patients were detected in the urine samples.

Molecular features of urine proteome for the pathogenesis of severe COVID-19 patients Despite only 6 COVID-19 urine samples were tested, our results showed a clear distinction between healthy control and COVID-19 patient urine proteomes. We used the fold change \u22652 and p-value\ufe640.05 as filters to find the differentially expressed proteins between mild and severe diseases compared to the healthy control, respectively.

We concluded that urine proteome is an important source that warrants more attentions for the understanding of COVID-19. Given the possibility of using proteome as a diagnostic tool we have shown, we are also aware of several limitations in our COVID-19 urine proteomics study. First, only limited number of COVID-19 patient samples were included in our proteomics study, future study to include more samples will likely mitigate the possible sampling bias. Second, the current COVID-19 patients were only categorized as M-COVID and S-COVID. We could not obtain intermediate type of COVID-19 patient samples to improve the resolution to predict the trend and progress of atypical pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV-2 due to the limited number of patients. Third, the batch effect of the sample processing and proteomics analysis may cause some deviations. Some healthy control datasets were generated before, though with the similar experiment processes. We recommended that the urine proteomics researches of the healthy, COVID-19 and their corresponding recovery samples were performed meanwhile if possible. Fourth, patients were subjected to different antiviral drug treatments, compounded with their age, preexisting health conditions as well as wide range of days of onset symptoms, it might cause some bias to the conclusion at this stage.",
