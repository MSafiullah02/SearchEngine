Taking summer vacation activity, limited time available to collect data on the units, and the demanding work environment into consideration, the researcher aimed to collect completed surveys from 150 nurses or 30% of the total population. Estimating a 35% to 40% response rate, 400 questionnaires were distributed over a 6-week period during the summer of 2006. The researcher (K.N.) spent 2 to 4 days over different shifts on each unit handing out and collecting surveys. A survey drop box was also placed on each unit.",

The scale to measure knowledge demonstrated a reliability coefficient of 0.32. Although this low score might be considered problematic for scales measuring a single trait or content domain, a high \u03b1 statistic cannot be expected for a multidimensional knowledge scale such as the one used. The scale to measure perception of risk demonstrated a reliability coefficient of 0.64. When the item measuring risk was separated from those measuring impact, the raw score increased to 0.79, suggesting that risk and impact, need to be measured separately. The scale to measure perception of effectiveness of preventive actions demonstrated a reliability coefficient of 0.50. This could be due to the discrepancy between nurses' perception of effectiveness of respirators and hand hygiene as opposed to surgical masks and eye protection.

Work status was shown to be significantly associated with compliance. Full-time nurses were 3 times more likely to report compliance with the recommended use of facial protection than part-time nurses. This finding is important because part-time nurses may need more intervention than full-time nurses to enhance their level of compliance, and interventions with this group may be logistically more difficult because they spend less time at the workplace. We also found that tenured nurses were more likely to report compliance than new nurses. The literature provides conflicting reports. In a study of correctional workers, it was found that young workers were more likely to be compliant with universal precautions than older workers.8 On the other hand, another study showed that longer job tenure was related to health care worker compliance with universal precautions and suggests that health care workers with more time on the job have had the opportunity to incorporate experience and judgment into their clinical practice, which could promote the use of appropriate preventive behaviors.4 This finding is important because managers could enhance compliance by placing nurses with greater tenure into supervisory and mentoring roles.",

This finding was significant at the univariate and multivariate levels of analysis. Measures for organizational support included management making health and safety a high priority, taking all reasonable steps to minimize hazards, encouraging employees' involvement in health and safety matters, and actively working to protect employees. This finding shows how important it is that nurses think their health and safety are valued by their employer. Those who think that they are valued will engage in healthier work behaviors. Interventions targeted at improving how supportive the organization is of employee health and safety can result in enhanced compliance. This finding is supported in the literature related to universal precautions.4, 25\n",

One study found that a worker's perception that the use of universal precautions interfered with their work (job hindrance) was a strong predictor of failure to comply with universal precautions.16 Reducing or eliminating these or other identified job hindrances is a good strategy to enhance compliance.
