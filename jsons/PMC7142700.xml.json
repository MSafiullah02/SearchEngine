The disease has rapidly spread around the world after its initial recognition in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China.1 Pulmonary involvement with diffuse alveolar damage and respiratory failure has been the major disease focus in patients with COVID-19; however, recent reports have highlighted the fact that kidney injury is also relatively common in this infection and is associated with increased morbidity and mortality.2\n,\n3 In a large case series from China, 15.5% of patients show evidence of kidney injury on presentation with 3.2% developing acute kidney injury during hospitalization.3 Hematuria and proteinuria are also common, being present in 27% and 44% of patients, respectively.3 We present the clinical and renal biopsy findings in an African American patient with COVID-19. This case raises the question of whether people of African descent with high-risk APOL1 genotype (presence of 2 risk alleles) could be at increased risk of kidney disease in the setting of COVID-19.",

Many of the intact glomeruli showed tuft collapse with overlying epithelial hypertrophy and hyperplasia in the Bowman space (Figure 1\n). No endocapillary hypercellularity or necrotizing lesions were present in the glomeruli. Intact portions of glomeruli showed minimal mesangial expansion. The tubular epithelium was notable for injury that was most prominent in the proximal tubules and included reactive nuclei with mitotic figures, as well as diffuse simplification with denudation of brush borders. The interstitium showed edema with an associated inflammatory infiltrate that predominantly consisted of lymphocytes and plasma cells with scattered eosinophils. No tubulitis was present. The degree of interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy present in the background was judged to be moderate. Direct immunofluorescence evaluation was negative for immune reactants in glomeruli, including IgA, IgG, IgM, C3, C1q, kappa, and lambda. Ultrastructural examination showed basement membranes that were slightly thickened. No immune-type electron-dense deposits were identified. There was severe foot process effacement, involving more than 90% of the glomerular basement membrane surface area. Occasional tubuloreticular inclusions were present in the glomerular endothelial cell cytoplasm. No definitive viral particles were identified by electron microscopy. A diagnosis of collapsing glomerulopathy was rendered. APOL1 genotyping on the biopsy material was performed as previously described,4 and the patient was found to be homozygous for the G1 risk allele (rs73885319). In situ analysis for the presence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA was performed using RNAscope (ACD, Newark, CA) as previously described,5 and failed to show evidence of viral RNA in the kidney (Figure 2\n).",

A recent report of postmortem kidney tissue from 6 patients who died of COVID-19 showed acute tubular injury without glomerular abnormalities.S3 The SARS-CoV-2 NP antigen was described in renal tubules by immunohistochemical analysis in this report when the renal tissue was reacted with a rabbit monoclonal antibody directed against the SARS-CoV-2 nucleoprotein (Clone ID: 019; Sino Biological, Beijing, China). In our laboratory, immunohistochemical analysis of renal tissue using this antibody under numerous conditions showed nonspecific positive staining in the renal parenchyma of all kidneys. In the case presented here, in situ hybridization analysis for SARS-CoV-2 failed to show evidence of viral RNA in the kidney, suggesting that direct infection of the kidney was not present. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that the virus was present below the level of detection. The biopsy from our patient is unique, as it demonstrates the presence of collapsing glomerulopathy. Acute tubular injury is commonly present on biopsy in association with collapsing glomerulopathy, and, therefore, is not necessarily being driven by either direct viral infection of the kidney or cytokine storm. The biopsy findings raise the question as to whether or not African American patients who contract COVID-19 are at increased risk of developing APOL1-related kidney disease.",

In fact, African American individuals have long been known to be at increased risk of developing kidney disease compared with other ethnicities without recent African ancestry.S4 This increased risk has been shown to largely result from 2 risk alleles in the APOL1 gene, G1 and G2, that are mutually exclusive and very common.S5 Approximately 39% of African American individuals possess one APOL1 risk allele and 13% are at increased risk of kidney disease as a result of homozygosity for APOL1 risk alleles.",

The etiology of APOL1-associated nephropathy has not been definitively determined, although there are data to support the role of innate immune pathways upregulated in viral illnesses and autoimmune disease as key drivers.S19 The renal biopsy findings in the case presented here are therefore concerning for an aggressive APOL1-associated collapsing glomerulopathy driven by a COVID-19\u2013related cytokine storm.
