It is widely distributed in most countries with an intensive and industrialised cattle production (van der Poel et al., 1993; Uttenthal et al., 1996; Baker et al., 1986). In young stock, BRSV infection may result in severe pneumonia with up to 100% morbidity and 5\u201320% mortality (Baker et al., 1986; Blom, 1981). The virus is often diagnosed in combination with other viruses, bacteria or mycoplasma (Kimman et al., 1989; Tegtmeier et al., 1999; Brown et al., 1998). Respiratory disease caused by BRSV is mainly observed in winter, but reinfections probably occur in the summer season without causing severe problems in the herd (van der Poel et al., 1993).",

Generally the immune responses to BRSV seemed to be independent of the age of the calf in contrast to earlier studies suggesting that the age of the calves being critical for the duration of the IgM response (Kimman et al., 1987b).

The IgG1 and the neutralising antibodies decreased over the initial 4 months with identical slopes if a new infection was not introduced into the herd. Coronavirus antibodies decreased for a few months then a natural infection interfered. The half-lives of the maternally derived antibodies against BRSV and coronavirus were, however, identical with a half-life of approximately 26 days. This figure is slightly higher than the 23 days previously found for passively transferred BRSV antibodies (Kimman et al., 1987b). Serological evidence for a coronavirus infection was present both in herd A and B. Furthermore, in herd C bovine coronavirus was detected in lung lavage fluid. Whether these infections were respiratoric or enteric are unknown, but no incidences of diarrhoea was reported from these farms. Respiratory enzootics involving several (viral) agents are often reported (Uttenthal et al., 1996; Martin et al., 1998; Larsen et al., 1999).",

Similarly, van der Poel et al. (1993) found only eight positive IgM samples in 387 sera collected year-round from 190 two-to-four-month old calves. These findings are not surprising, since IgM is only present for a few weeks following infection. Furthermore, the sera included in the test sample were partly from adult cattle. The samples were not analysed for IgA, which may have revealed more positive animals due to the longer duration of this isotype and because IgA, in contrast to IgM, is induced in response to reinfection (Kimman et al., 1987b). The restricted detection of BRSV-specific IgA and IgM was in contrast to what was found following bovine PI-3 virus infection (Graham et al., 1999). Thus, in this study paired field sera from herds with known PI-3 infection revealed IgM-anti PI-3 virus in 44% and IgA in 26% of all sera analysed.",

In a slightly different study all bulk milk samples obtained during June to December from 341 herds in England and Wales contained antibodies to BRSV (Paton et al., 1998), suggesting a similar high herd prevalence in UK as in Denmark. Accordingly, 54% of the samples had BRSV specific antibodies of both IgG1 and IgG2 isotypes. The presence of cattle with IgG1 but no IgG2 probably represent newly infected animal or animals with residues of maternally derived antibodies, whereas the very limited number (6.6%) of IgG1 negative and IgG2 positive cattle may be convalescent animals having lost their IgG1. Unfortunately the age of the specific animal was not provided; thus a more detailed comparison of age and isotypes was not possible.",
