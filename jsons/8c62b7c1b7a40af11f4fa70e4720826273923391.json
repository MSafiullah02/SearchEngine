Risk factors for HBV and HCV infection include parenteral exposure to blood products, parenteral drug use, hemoglobinopathies, heterosexual or homosexual activity, and maternal infection during pregnancy. Numerous potential drugs are available for the treatment of hepatitis B and C (Table 4 ). Of these, interferon alfa has been modestly efficacious, with increased efficacy when used in combination with ribavirin.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 294, "end": 296, "text": "51", "ref_id": "BIBREF50"}, {"start": 745, "end": 748, "text": "52,", "ref_id": "BIBREF51"}, {"start": 749, "end": 751, "text": "53", "ref_id": "BIBREF52"}], "ref_spans": [{"start": 1113, "end": 1121, "text": "(Table 4", "ref_id": "TABREF3"}], "section": "Viral Infections of the Gastrointestinal Tract"}, {"text": "Interferons are cytokines released by virus-infected host cells. Uninfected cells acquire resistance to RNA and DNA viruses by binding and internalizing interferons. Although their exact mechanism of action is not totally understood, interferons activate cellular mechanisms that induce the release of enzymes causing degradation of viral mRNA and inhibition of viral protein synthesis. 39 Recombinant interferon alfa-2b is licensed in the United States for the treatment of chronic HBV infection in adults and children. Subcutaneous administration three times a week for 6 months results in normalization of liver transaminase levels and seroconversion (presence of antibody to hepatitis B e antigen [HBeAb] and absence of hepatitis B e antigen [HBeAg]) in 40 to 50 percent of adult patients. Controlled clinical trials suggest similar response rates (range, 20% to 58%) in children living in Western countries but lower response rates in Asian children. 54 The response rate is lower in those who acquire HBV in the neonatal period and higher with higher doses of interferon. Response rates (defined as absence of HCV DNA in serum) are similar when interferon alfa is used in the treatment of adults with hepatitis C, but a relapse rate of 50 percent occurs after completion of therapy (net persistent response rate of 5% to 20%). 55 Nonresponders show no improvement with repeated treatment, higher doses, or longer duration of therapy. Clinical studies in children are limited, but as with HBV, similar response and relapse rates are observed in children with HCV. 55 When used in combination with orally administered ribavirin, the persistent response rate of interferon alfa in the treatment of HCV increases to 49 percent. 56 Interferon alfa might also be useful in the treatment of EBV lymphoprolipherative disease. 57 Side effects of interferon therapy that are frequent but transient include fever, headache, malaise, thrombocytopenia, and leukopenia. Less frequently, alopecia, prolonged fatigue, and depression may occur. The need for repeated parenteral administration and the lack of sustained response in most patients implies an adequate selection of subjects that should receive treatment with interferon. In the case of HBV, better response rates are observed in non-Asian children with infection acquired beyond the neonatal period, who have mild pretreatment elevations of liver enzymes and liver histology, and lower baseline serum HBV DNA or hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg) concentrations.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 387, "end": 389, "text": "39", "ref_id": "BIBREF38"}, {"start": 956, "end": 958, "text": "54", "ref_id": "BIBREF53"}, {"start": 1333, "end": 1335, "text": "55", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 1569, "end": 1571, "text": "55", "ref_id": "BIBREF54"}, {"start": 1730, "end": 1732, "text": "56", "ref_id": "BIBREF55"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Interferon Alfa/Ribavirin"}, {"text": "Nucleoside analogues such as lamivudine, famciclovir, adefovir, and tenofovir inhibit HBV replication in vitro by inhibiting DNA polymerase.

Prevention through immunization is possible for influenza and hepatitis B virus infections, and it should be encouraged, particularly in high-risk populations. Passive prophylaxis with intravenous immunoglobulin for high-risk groups is available for RSV and CMV, and monoclonal antibody products are now available for RSV as well. The number of drugs becoming available for treating severe viral infections in children is increasing. However, it is important to keep in mind that their efficacy might be limited by the need for administration early during the course of disease (and therefore for adequate diagnostics), their frequent toxicity, and the development of resistance. Adequate supportive therapy continues to be the cornerstone in the treatment of severe viral infections in children.
