However, the viruses have now been shown to cause upper and lower respiratory tract illnesses, gastrointestinal problems, hepatitis, myocarditis, meningitis, and encephalitis in humans (Johansson et al., 1996, Schiff et al., 2007, Tyler, 2001, Tyler et al., 2004).",

Differences in the migration patterns of RNA segments among strains have allowed viral recombinants derived from different serotypes to be identified (Ramig et al., 1977). Mammalian orthoreoviruses have been grouped into three serotypes, which can be differentiated by the capacity of type-specific antisera to neutralize virus infectivity and inhibit hemagglutination. The serotypes are represented by three commonly studied prototype isolates, type 1 Lang (T1L), type 2 Jones (T2J), and type 3 Dearing (T3D) (Schiff et al., 2007). The genomic sequences of these three prototype strains confirm the serological classification (Wiener and Joklik, 1989, Breun et al., 2001, Yin et al., 2004). Specifically, study of orthoreovirus S1 gene encoding the \u03c31 protein, which is involved in viral attachment to cells, has been found to be useful to understand functional organization within an attachment protein (Chappell et al., 1997). The \u03c31 protein is a target of serotype-specific neutralizing antibodies, and the protein is responsible for cell and tissue tropism (Lee et al., 1981, Weiner et al., 1980).",

Thus, the present work is the first molecular epidemiological study of porcine orthoreoviruses in diarrheic pigs. We found that 19.0% of diarrheic fecal samples from pigs tested positive for porcine orthoreovirus, indicating that infection with such viruses is endemic in piglets with diarrhea in South Korea. Among orthoreovirus-positive fecal samples, only 6.7% tested positive for porcine orthoreoviruses alone, whereas the remainder were also positive for other enteric pathogens including the GARVs, GBRVs, GCRVs, PSaVs, E. coli, Salmonella spp., and swine dysentery, suggesting that concurrent infections with other enteric pathogens may increase the clinical signs and intestinal pathology caused by porcine orthoreovirus infection (Chang et al., 1999).",

Phylogenetically, type 3 orthoreoviruses can be classified into four lineages, with lineage I consisting of a human strain isolated in 1996; lineages II and III of bovine, murine, and human strains isolated in the 1950s and 1960s; and lineage IV of porcine strains isolated in the 2000s, including the 10 Korean porcine orthoreovirus strains of the present work and a Chinese porcine strain isolated in 2008. The classification of type 3 lineages is assisted by comparison of deduced amino acid sequences, in that strains of lineage IV have the highest nucleotide (97.0\u201398.1%) and deduced amino acid (96.4\u201398.2%) identities, but much lower nucleotide (70.7\u201384.2%) and deduced amino acid (74.8\u201390.2%) identities when compared to strains of other lineages. This indicates that the porcine orthoreovirus strains belong to a different genetic lineage, and may have evolved on a pathway distinct from that of the human, bovine, and murine strains. Because the sequences of recently isolated human, bovine, and murine strains, and those of other porcine strains, are not yet available, the detailed classification remains unclear. In-depth molecular analysis using strains isolated from other species and from various geographic areas is needed to understand viral diversity and evolution and to accurately classify the strains.",

            "text": "The type 3 orthoreovirus S1 gene, which encodes the viral cell attachment protein, is strongly associated with tissue tropism (Schiff et al., 2007). For example, the key amino acid residues of the \u03c31 protein implicated in type 3 neural tropism and neurovirulence have been shown to be conserved (Kaye et al., 1986, Bassel-Duby et al., 1986). In all known mammalian orthoreoviruses, the \u03c31 protein contains a binding site for sialic acid at amino acids 198\u2013204 (NLATRLP) (Chappell et al., 1997, Rubin et al., 1992). The conservation of this sequence suggests that binding to sialic acid may be important for neurovirulence (Chappell et al., 1997, Chappell et al., 2000, Dermody et al., 1990), enhancing the ability of an orthoreovirus to migrate from the murine intestine to the CNS (Barton et al., 2003). Interestingly, the NLATRLP sequence was conserved in 9 of our 10 Korean porcine orthoreoviruses except KPR-155 strain (198N \u2192 198S). In addition, the isoleucine at position 249 of the \u03c31 protein has been linked to the capacity of type 3 orthoreovirus strains to infect the murine intestine and to spread therefrom to the CNS (Chappell et al., 1998). All 10 Korean porcine orthoreovirus strains contained an isoleucine residue at position 249 of the \u03c31 protein. A protease-resistant \u03c31 protein may be required both for efficient viral growth in the intestine and migration to secondary sites of replication, including the CNS (Barton et al., 2003). Moreover, two amino acids (350D and 419E) in the \u03c31 head domain, associated with neurotropism, were conserved in all 10 Korean porcine orthoreovirus strains, suggesting that these 9 of 10 strains may be neurovirulent in animals. Thus, we are currently studying both enterotropism and CNS tropism of the novel viruses, as well as replication in other organs and tissues of pigs and mice.",
