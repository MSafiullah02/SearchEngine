            "text": "\nAt first, three kinds of the upper-supply and lower-exhaust schemes play the same role in the cleaning of indoor air. Based on the data of the mixed bacteria shown in Fig. 4.42, the difference is not obvious for the concentration range 1.1\u20131.6 CFU/Petri dish. Moreover, under the condition of the air change rate 12 h\u22121 (which could corresponds to the air cleanliness level 100,000), the bacterial concentration reached the value within air cleanliness level from 1000 to 10,000. This means the isolation ward has a certain capacity of air cleaning.Based on the principle of protecting the medical personnel, the experimental result for scheme No. 2-a (with one air return opening) is quite prominent.The area of the sampling positions shown in the rectangular frame shown in Fig. 4.40 is in front of the patient, which includes the sampling points 22\u201325 and 27\u201330.In this area, the average bacterial concentration for scheme No. 2-a (with one air return opening) is 8172 CFU/Petri dish. The average bacterial concentration for scheme No. 1 is 10007 CFU/Petri dish. The concentration for scheme No. 1 is larger than that for scheme No. 2-a (with one air return opening) by 22.5%. For sampling points 22\u201330, the concentration for scheme No. 1 is larger than that for scheme No. 2-a (with one air return opening) by 25%.Therefore, it is meaningful to adopt scheme No. 2-a (with one air return opening) in this aspect. As mentioned before, this result has been proved by numerical simulation.Although there is no experimental data for scheme No. 2-b with two air return openings and scheme No. 3, it is shown from numerical result shown in Table 4.4 that the concentrations in the breathing zone at the height 0.65\u20131.5 m for scheme No. 2-b with two air return openings and scheme No. 3 are larger than scheme No. 2-a with one air return opening and scheme No. 4.It has been mentioned before that it is not important how much is the average indoor concentration, but the concentration in the working area of the medical personnel should be lowest. Therefore, the performance of scheme No. 2-a with one air return opening is superior to that of scheme No. 1, scheme No. 2-b with two air return openings and scheme No. 3.Why the concentrations for sampling points 26\u201332 on the bed for various schemes are obviously larger than other sampling points? The concentration of scheme No. 2-a with one air return opening is larger than the indoor average concentration by two times, which is also larger than that for scheme No. 1 by three times and larger than that for scheme No. 4 by three and four times. This is because these petri dishes were placed on the bed, which is close to the pollutant source. This is understandable.The whole performance measured for scheme No. 4 is superior to that of scheme No. 2-a with one return air opening and scheme 1, while the performances of the latter two schemes are better than other schemes by both measurement and simulation. Based on the simulated result by Weipeng Deng shown in Table 4.4, the performance for the scheme with one-side top-supply is the best. Therefore, it is easy to combine these findings for understanding purpose. Because of the advantages of these two schemes, they are widely used.As mentioned in Sect. 10.1007/978-981-10-2923-3_3, the area of the air supply outlet can be enlarged until the air velocity at the air supply outlet is not less than 0.13 m/s.Two air supply outlets can be placed separately as the scheme No. 4, on condition that the air supply velocity is not less than 0.13 m/s.\n",
