            "text": "As described in Chapter 1, no virus yet discovered has the genetic information that encodes the tools necessary for the generation of metabolic energy or for protein synthesis (ribosomes). So all viruses are dependent on their host cells for these functions, but the way in which viruses persuade their hosts to express their genetic information for them varies considerably. Patterns of virus replication are determined by tight controls on virus gene expression. There are fundamental differences in the control mechanisms of these processes in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, and these differences inevitably affect the viruses that use them as hosts. In addition, the relative simplicity and compact size of most virus genomes (compared with those of cells) creates further limits. Cells have evolved varied and complex mechanisms for controlling gene expression by using their extensive genetic capacity. Viruses have had to achieve highly specific quantitative, temporal, and spatial control of expression with much more limited genetic resources. Viruses have counteracted their genetic limitations by the evolving of a range of solutions to these problems. These mechanisms include:\u25aaPowerful positive and negative signals that promote or repress gene expression\n\u25aaHighly compressed genomes in which overlapping reading frames are common\u25aaControl signals that are frequently nested within other genes\u25aaStrategies that allow multiple polypeptides to be created from a single messenger RNA\n",

            "text": "Gene expression involves regulatory loops mediated by signals that act either in cis (affecting the activity of neighboring genetic regions) or in trans (giving rise to diffusible products that act on regulatory sites anywhere in the genome). For example, transcription promoters are cis-acting sequences that are located adjacent to the genes whose transcription they control, while proteins such as transcription factors, which bind to specific sequences present on any stretch of nucleic acid present in the cell, are examples of trans-acting factors. The relative simplicity of virus genomes and the elegance of their control mechanisms are models that form the basis of our current understanding of genetic regulation. This chapter assumes that you are familiar with the mechanisms involved in cellular control of gene expression. However, before we get into the details of virus gene expression, we\u2019ll start with a brief reminder of some important aspects.Box 5.1It\u2019s all about the geneEven before Richard Dawkins wrote The Selfish Gene in the 1970s, the molecular biology revolution in the 1960s had ensured that the gene became the biological object around which our thinking revolved. In Dawkins\u2019s view, genes are only concerned with their own survival. When we look at how malleable virus genomes are, and how easily genes flow from host to virus and from one virus to another, it\u2019s easy to believe Dawkins was telling the truth. So in many ways, this chapter on gene expression is at the very heart of this book. And understanding the mechanisms of transmission and expression that act on genes is central to understanding modern biology.\n",

Collections of metabolically related genes are grouped together and coordinately controlled as operons. Transcription of these operons typically produces a polycistronic mRNA that encodes several different proteins. During subsequent stages of expression, transcription is also regulated by a number of mechanisms that act, in Mark Ptashne\u2019s famous phrase, as \u201cgenetic switches,\u201d turning on or off the transcription of different genes. Such mechanisms include antitermination, which is controlled by trans-acting factors that promote the synthesis of longer transcripts encoding additional genetic information, and by various modifications of RNA polymerase. Bacterial \u03c3 (sigma) factors are apoproteins that affect the specificity of the RNA polymerase holoenzyme (active form) for different promoters. Several bacteriophages (e.g., phage SP01 of Bacillus subtilis) encode proteins that function as alternative \u03c3 factors, sequestering RNA polymerase and altering the rate at which phage genes are transcribed. Phage T4 of Escherichia coli encodes an enzyme that carries out a covalent modification (adenosine diphosphate [ADP]-ribosylation) of the host-cell RNA polymerase. This is believed to eliminate the requirement of the polymerase holoenzyme for \u03c3 factor and to achieve an effect similar to the production of modified \u03c3 factors by other bacteriophages.",

Together with Francois Jacob and Jacques Monod, Lwoff subsequently showed that the cells of some bacterial strains carried a bacteriophage in a dormant form, known as a prophage, and that the phage could be made to alternate between the lysogenic (nonproductive) and lytic (productive) growth cycles. After many years of study, our understanding of \u03bb has been refined into a picture that represents one of the best understood and most elegant genetic control systems yet to be investigated.

If levels of cII remain below a critical level, transcription from PR and PL continues, and the phage undergoes a productive replication cycle that culminates in lysis of the cell and the release of phage particles. This is the sequence of events that occurs in the vast majority of infected cells. However, in a few rare instances, the concentration of cII protein builds up, transcription of cI is enhanced, and intracellular levels of the cI repressor protein rise. The repressor binds to OR and OL, which prevents transcription of all phage genes (particularly cro; see later) except itself. The level of cI protein is maintained automatically by a negative feedback mechanism, since at high concentrations the repressor also binds to the left-hand end of OR and prevents transcription of cI (Figure 5.3\n). This autoregulation of cI synthesis keeps the cell in a stable state of lysogeny.",

This protein, the normal function of which is to induce the expression of cellular genes that permit the cell to adapt to and survive in altered environmental conditions, cleaves the cI repressor protein. In itself, this would not be sufficient to prevent the cell from reentering the lysogenic state; however, when repressor protein is not bound to OR, cro is transcribed from PR. Cro also binds to OR but, unlike cI, which preferentially binds the right-hand end of OR, the Cro protein binds preferentially to the left-hand end of OR, preventing the transcription of cI and enhancing its own transcription in a positive-feedback loop.

The concepts of proteins with independent DNA-binding and dimerization domains, protein cooperativity in DNA binding, and DNA looping allowing proteins bound at distant sites to interact with one another have all risen from the study of \u03bb.

DNA in eukaryotic cells has an elaborate structure, forming complicated and dynamic but far from random complexes with numerous proteins to form chromatin. Although the contents of eukaryotic cell nuclei appear amorphous in electron micrographs (at least in interphase), they are actually highly ordered.

It is probable, for example, that retroviruses are more likely to integrate into the host-cell genome at these sites than elsewhere. Transcriptionally active DNA is also hypomethylated; that is, there is a relative scarcity of nucleotides modified by the covalent attachment of methyl groups in these regions compared with the frequency of methylation in transcriptionally quiescent regions of the genome.

Initiation is influenced dramatically by sequences upstream of the transcription start site, which function by acting as recognition sites for families of highly specific DNA-binding proteins known as transcription factors.

            "text": "This type of genome occurs in many animal viruses and plant viruses (Appendix 2\n). In terms of both the number of different families and the number of individual viruses, this is the largest single class of virus genomes. Essentially, these virus genomes act as messenger RNAs and are themselves translated immediately after infection of the host cell (Chapter 3). Not surprisingly with so many representatives, this class of genomes displays a very diverse range of strategies for controlling gene expression and genome replication. However, in very broad terms, the viruses in this class can be subdivided into two groups:\u25aaProduction of a polyprotein encompassing the whole of the virus genetic information, which is subsequently cleaved by proteases to produce precursor and mature polypeptides. These cleavages can be a subtle way of regulating the expression of genetic information. Alternative cleavages result in the production of various proteins with distinct properties from a single precursor (e.g., in picornaviruses and potyviruses; Figure 5.7\n). Certain plant viruses with multipartite genomes use a very similar strategy for controlling gene expression, although a separate polyprotein is produced from each of the genome segments. The best studied example of this is the comoviruses, whose genome organization is very similar to that of the picornaviruses and may represent another member of this superfamily (Figure 5.7).\u25aaProduction of subgenomic mRNAs, resulting from two or more rounds of translation of the genome. This strategy is used to achieve temporal separation of what are essentially early and late phases of replication, in which nonstructural proteins, including a virus replicase, are produced during the early phase followed by structural proteins in the late phase (Figure 5.8\n). The proteins produced in each of these phases may result from proteolytic processing of a polyprotein precursor, although this encompasses only part of the virus genome rather than the entire genome, as before. Proteolytic processing offers further opportunities for regulation of the ratio of different polypeptides produced in each phase of replication (e.g., in togaviruses and tymoviruses). In addition to proteolysis, some viruses employ another strategy to produce alternative polypeptides from a subgenomic mRNA, either by read-through of a leaky translation stop codon (e.g., tobamoviruses such as TMV; see Figure 3.13), or by deliberate ribosomal frame-shifting at a particular site (see \u201cPosttranscriptional Control of Expression,\u201d later).\n",

Few other genomes, virus or cellular, have been studied in as much detail as SV40, which has been a model for the study of eukaryotic transcription mechanisms (particularly DNA replication; see Chapter 6) for many years. In this sense, SV40 provides a eukaryotic parallel with the bacteriophage \u03bb genome. In vitro systems exist for both transcription and replication of the SV40 genome, and it is believed that all the virus and cellular DNA-binding proteins involved in both of these processes are known. The SV40 genome encodes two T-antigens (tumor antigens) known as large T-antigen and small T-antigen after the sizes of the proteins (Figure 5.12\n). Replication of the double-stranded DNA genome of SV40 occurs in the nucleus of the host cell. Transcription of the genome is carried out by host-cell RNA polymerase II, and large T-antigen plays a vital role in regulating transcription of the virus genome. Small T-antigen is not essential for virus replication but does allow virus DNA to accumulate in the nucleus. Both proteins contain nuclear localization signals that result in their accumulation in the nucleus, where they migrate after being synthesized in the cytoplasm.",

The early proteins made are the two T-antigens. As the concentration of large T-antigen builds up in the nucleus, transcription of the early genes is repressed by direct binding of the protein to the origin region of the virus genome, preventing transcription from the early promoter and causing the switch to the late phase of infection. Large T-antigen is also required for replication of the genome, and this is discussed further in Chapter 7. After DNA replication has occurred, transcription of the late genes occurs from the late promoter and results in the synthesis of the structural proteins VP1, VP2, and VP3. This process illustrates two classic features of control of virus gene expression. First, the definition of the early and late phases of replication, when different sets of genes tend to be expressed, is before and after genome replication.

However, several virus families have taken advantage of this capacity of their host cells to compress more genetic information into their genomes. A good example of such a reliance on splicing are the parvoviruses, transcription of which results in multiple spliced, polyadenylated transcripts in the cytoplasm of infected cells, enabling them to produce multiple proteins from their 5 kb genomes (Figure 5.5), and similarly, polyomaviruses such as SV40 (Figure 5.12). In contrast, the large genetic capacity of herpesviruses makes it possible for these viruses to produce mostly unspliced monocistronic mRNAs, each of which is expressed from its own promoter, thereby rendering unnecessary extensive splicing to produce the required range of proteins.",

The first proteins to be expressed, E1A and E1B, are encoded by a transcriptional unit on the r-strand at the extreme left-hand end of the adenovirus genome (Figure 5.17). These proteins are primarily transcriptional trans-regulatory proteins comparable to the Tax and Tat proteins described earlier, but are also involved in transformation of adenovirus-infected cells (Chapter 6).

The transcription of the E1A itself is a balanced, self-regulating system. The immediate-early genes of DNA viruses typically have strong enhancer elements upstream of their promoters.

Both VA RNA I and VA RNA II have a high degree of secondary structure, and neither molecule encodes any polypeptide (in these two respects they are similar to tRNAs), and they accumulate to high levels in the cytoplasm of adenovirus-infected cells. The way in which these two RNAs act is not completely understood, but their net effect is to boost the synthesis of adenovirus late proteins. The VA RNAs are processed by the host cell to form virus-encoded miRNAs. These operate through RNA interference (see Chapter 6) to downregulate a large number of cellular genes involved in RNA binding, splicing, and translation. In addition, virus infection of cells stimulates the production of interferons (Chapter 6). One of the actions of interferons is to activate a cellular protein kinase known as PKR that inhibits the initiation of translation. VA RNA I binds to this kinase, preventing its activity and relieving inhibition on translation. The effects of interferons on the cell are generalized (discussed in Chapter 6) and result in inhibition of the translation of both cellular and virus mRNAs. The effect of the VA RNAs is to promote selectively the translation of adenovirus mRNAs at the expense of cellular mRNAs whose translation is inhibited.",

Negative-regulatory sequences in the HIV and HTLV genomes cause the retention of virus mRNAs in the nucleus of the infected cell.

A number of viruses use variations of this sequence to regulate the amounts of protein synthesized from a single mRNA. Examples include the Tax and Rex proteins of HTLV, which are encoded by overlapping reading frames in the same doubly spliced 2.1 kb mRNA (Figure 5.15). The AUG initiation codon for the Rex protein is upstream of that for Tax but provides a less favorable context for initiation of translation than the sequence surrounding the Tax AUG codon.

Although these genomes are genetically economical (i.e., have discarded most cis-acting control elements and express their entire coding capacity as a single polyprotein), they have retained long noncoding regions (NCRs) at their 5\u2032 ends, comprising approximately 10% of the entire genome. These sequences are involved in the replication and possibly packaging of the virus genome. Translation of most cellular mRNAs is initiated when ribosomes recognize the 5\u2032 end of the mRNA and scan along the nucleotide sequence until they reach an AUG initiation codon. Picornavirus genomes are not translated in this way. The 5\u2032 end of the RNA is not capped and thus is not recognized by ribosomes in the same way as other mRNAs, but it is modified by the addition of the VPg protein (see Chapters 3 and 6Chapter 3Chapter 6). There are also multiple AUG codons in the 5\u2032 NCR upstream of the start of the polyprotein coding sequences that are not recognized by ribosomes. In picornavirus-infected cells, a virus protease cleaves the 220-kDa cap-binding complex (CBC) involved in binding the m7 G cap structure at the 5\u2032 end of the mRNA during initiation of translation. Translation of artificially mutated picornavirus mRNAs in vitro and the construction of bicistronic picornavirus genomes bearing additional 5\u2032 NCR signals in the middle of the polyprotein have resulted in the concept of the ribosome landing pad, or internal ribosomal entry site (IRES). Rather than scanning along the RNA from the 5\u2032 end, ribosomes bind to the RNA via the IRES and begin translation internally. This is a precise method for controlling the translation of virus proteins. Very few cellular mRNAs use this mechanism but it has been shown to be used by a variety of viruses, including picornaviruses, hepatitis C virus, coronaviruses, and flaviviruses.",

The problem with this strategy lies in decoding the information. If each polypeptide is expressed from a monocistronic mRNA transcribed from its own promoter, the additional cis-acting sequences required to control and coordinate expression might cancel out any genetic advantage gained. More importantly, there is the problem of coordinately regulating the transcription and translation of multiple different messages. Therefore, it is highly desirable to express several polypeptides from a single RNA transcript, and the examples described earlier illustrate several mechanisms by which this can be achieved (e.g., differential splicing and control of RNA export from the nucleus, or initiation of translation).Box 5.4Viruses: Making more from lessIf viruses were as wasteful with their genomes as cells are, they would struggle to exist. For most cellular genes, it\u2019s one gene, one protein. And while some of the big DNA viruses do have that genetic arrangement, most viruses have to work harder and get more than one protein out of a gene. There are lots of ways they do this. Splicing, alternative start codons, ribosomal frameshifting, alternate protease cleavages\u2014all these are used by different viruses to squeeze the maximum amount of information into the minimum space. Of course the trick is to ensure that you can get the information, in the form of proteins, out again.

Retrovirus genomes are transcribed to produce at least two 5\u2032 capped, 3\u2032 polyadenylated mRNAs. Spliced mRNAs encode the envelope proteins, as well as, in more complex retroviruses such as HTLV and HIV, additional proteins such as the Tax/Tat and Rex/Rev proteins (Figure 5.15). A long, unspliced transcript encodes the gag, pro, and pol genes and also forms the genomic RNA packaged into virions. The problem faced by retroviruses is how to express three different proteins from one long transcript. The arrangement of the three genes varies in different viruses. In some cases (e.g., HTLV) they occupy three different reading frames, while in others (e.g., HIV) the protease (pro) gene forms an extension at the 5\u2032 end of the pol gene (Figure 5.20\n). In the latter case, the protease and polymerase (i.e., reverse transcriptase) are expressed as a polyprotein that is autocatalytically cleaved into the mature proteins in a process that is similar to the cleavage of picornavirus polyproteins.",

Most ribosomes encountering this sequence will translate it without difficulty and continue on along the transcript until a translation stop codon is reached.

Typically, immediate-early genes encode activator proteins, early genes encode further regulatory proteins, and late genes encode virus structural proteins. Viruses make use of the biochemical apparatus of their host cells to express their genetic information as proteins and, consequently, utilize the appropriate biochemical language recognized by the cell. Thus viruses of prokaryotes produce polycistronic mRNAs, while viruses with eukaryotic hosts produce more monocistronic mRNAs. Some viruses of eukaryotes do produce polycistronic mRNA to assist with the coordinate regulation of multiple genes. In addition, viruses rely on specific cis- and trans-acting mechanisms to manipulate the biology of their host cells and to enhance and coordinate the expression of their own genetic information.\n",
