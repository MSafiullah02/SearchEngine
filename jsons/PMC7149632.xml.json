It is beyond the scope of this book to give detailed accounts of these methods. However, it is worth taking some time here to illustrate how some of these techniques have been applied to virology, remembering that these newer techniques are complementary to and do not replace the classical techniques of virology. Initially, any investigation of a virus genome will usually include questions about the following:\u25aaComposition: DNA or RNA, single stranded or double stranded, linear or circular\u25aaSize and number of segments\u25aaNucleotide sequence\u25aaTerminal structures\u25aaCoding capacity: open reading frames\u25aaRegulatory signals: transcription enhancers, promoters, and terminators\n",

To some extent, this is still true of molecular biology techniques, although the emphasis on extensive purification has declined as techniques of molecular cloning have become more advanced. DNA virus genomes can be analyzed directly by restriction endonuclease digestion without resorting to molecular cloning, and this approach was achieved for the first time with SV40 DNA in 1971. The first pieces of DNA to be molecularly cloned were restriction fragments of bacteriophage \u03bb DNA, which were cloned into the DNA genome of SV40 by Berg and colleagues in 1972. This means that virus genomes were both the first cloning vectors and the first nucleic acids to be analyzed by these techniques. In 1977, the genome of bacteriophage \u03d5X174 was the first replicon to be completely sequenced.",

However, direct analysis of RNA by these methods was laborious and notoriously difficult. RNA sequence analysis did not begin to advance rapidly until the widespread use of reverse transcriptase (isolated from retroviruses) to convert RNA into cDNA in the 1970s.

Direct analysis by electron microscopy, if calibrated with known standards, can be used to estimate the size of nucleic acid molecules. Hybridization of complementary nucleotide sequences can also be used in a number of ways to analyze virus genomes (Chapter 1). Perhaps the most important single technique has been gel electrophoresis (Figure 3.1\n). The earliest gel matrix employed for separating molecules was based on starch and gave relatively poor resolution. It is now most common to use agarose gels to separate large nucleic acid molecules, which may be very large indeed\u2014several megabases (million base pairs) in the case of techniques such as pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) to separate smaller pieces (down to sizes of a few nucleotides). Apart from the fact that sequencing depends on the ability to separate molecules that differ from each other by only one nucleotide in length, gel electrophoresis has been of great value in analyzing intact virus genomes, particularly the analysis of viruses with segmented genomes (see later discussion). The most recent and most powerful sequence analysis techniques such as pyrosequencing have done away with electrophoresis and rely on light detection from fluorescent compounds.",

This is because positive-sense vRNA is essentially mRNA, and the first event in a normally infected cell is to translate the vRNA to make the virus proteins responsible for genome replication. In this case, direct introduction of RNA into cells circumvents the earliest stages of the replicative cycle (Chapter 4). Virus genomes that are composed of double-stranded DNA are also infectious. The events that occur here are a little more complex, because the virus genome must first be transcribed by host polymerases to produce mRNA. This is relatively simple for phage genomes introduced into prokaryotes, but for viruses that replicate in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells, such as herpesviruses, the DNA must first find its way to the appropriate cellular compartment. Most of the DNA that is introduced into cells by transfection is degraded by cellular nucleases. However, irrespective of its sequence, a small proportion of the newly introduced DNA finds its way into the nucleus, where it is transcribed by cellular polymerases.",

Therefore, because purified negative-sense genomes cannot be directly translated by the host cell and are not replicated in the absence of the virus polymerase, these genomes are inherently noninfectious.

Similarly, various polymorphisms (such as electrophoretic mobility of proteins) can be used to determine the genetic structure of a virus.\u25aa\nRestriction maps: Site-specific cleavage of DNA by restriction endonucleases can be used to determine the structure of virus genomes. RNA genomes can be analyzed in this way after cDNA cloning.\u25aa\nTranscription maps: Maps of regions encoding various mRNAs can be determined by hybridization of mRNA species to specific genome fragments (e.g., restriction fragments). The precise start/finish of mRNAs can be determined by single-strand-specific nuclease digestion of radiolabelled probes. Proteins encoded by individual mRNAs can be determined by translation in vitro. Ultraviolet (UV) irradiation of RNA virus genomes can also be used to determine the position of open reading frames because those farthest from the translation start are the least likely to be expressed by in vitro translation after partial degradation of the virus RNA by UV light.\u25aa\nTranslation maps: Pactamycin (an antibiotic that inhibits translation) has been used to map protein-coding regions of enteroviruses.

These differences are due to the mechanism of genome replication, with error rates in RNA-dependent RNA polymerases generally being higher than in DNA-dependent DNA polymerases. Some RNA virus polymerases do have proofreading functions, but in general mutation rates are higher in most RNA viruses than in DNA viruses. For a virus, mutations are a mixed blessing. The ability to generate antigenic variants that can escape the immune response is a clear advantage, but mutation also results in many defective particles, since most mutations are deleterious. In the most extreme cases (e.g., HIV), the error rate is 10\u22123 to 10\u22124 per nucleotide incorporated. The HIV genome is approximately 9.7 kb long; therefore, there will be 0.9 to 9.7 mutations in every genome copied. Hence, in this case, the wild-type virus actually consists of a fleeting majority type that dominates the dynamic equilibrium (i.e., the population of genomes) present in all cultures of the virus. These mixtures of molecular variants are known as quasispecies and also occur in other RNA viruses (e.g., picornaviruses). However, the majority of these variants will be noninfectious or seriously disadvantaged and are therefore rapidly weeded out of a replicating population. This mechanism is an important force in virus evolution (see \u201cEvolution and Epidemiology\u201d).\n",

Examples include base analogues such as 5-bromouracil, which result in faulty base pairing; intercalating agents (e.g., acridine dyes) that stack between bases, causing insertions or deletions; and UV irradiation, which causes the formation of pyrimidine dimers, which are excised from DNA by repair mechanisms that are much more error-prone than the usual enzymes used in DNA replication.\n",

            "text": "The phenotype of a mutant virus depends on the type of mutation(s) it has and also upon the location of the mutation(s) within the genome. Each of the following classes of mutations can occur naturally in viruses or may be artificially induced for experimental purposes:\u25aa\nBiochemical markers: These include drug resistance mutations, mutations that result in altered virulence, polymorphisms resulting in altered electrophoretic mobility of proteins or nucleic acids, and altered sensitivity to inactivating agents.\u25aa\nDeletions: Similar in some ways to nonsense mutants (see later) but may include one or more virus genes and involve noncoding control regions of the genome (promoters, etc.). Spontaneous deletion mutants often accumulate in virus populations as defective-interfering (D.I.) particles. These noninfectious but not necessarily genetically inert genomes are thought to be important in establishing the course and pathogenesis of certain virus infections (see Chapter 6). Genetic deletions can only revert to wild-type by recombination, which usually occurs at comparatively low frequencies. Deletion mutants are very useful for assigning structure\u2013function relationships to virus genomes, since they are easily mapped by physical analysis.\u25aa\nHost range: This term can refer either to whole animal hosts or to permissive cell types in vitro. Conditional mutants of this class have been isolated using amber-suppressor cells (mostly for phages but also for animal viruses using in vitro systems).\u25aa\nNonsense: These result from alteration of a coding sequence of a protein to one of three translation stop codons (UAG, amber; UAA, ochre; UGA, opal). Translation is terminated, resulting in the production of an amino-terminal fragment of the protein. The phenotype of these mutations can be suppressed by propagation of a virus in a cell (bacterial or, more recently, animal) with altered suppressor tRNAs. Nonsense mutations are rarely leaky (i.e., the normal function of the protein is completely obliterated) and can only revert to wild-type at the original site (see later), so they usually have a low reversion frequency.\u25aa\nPlaque morphology: Mutants may be either large-plaque mutants, which replicate more rapidly than the wild-type, or small-plaque mutants, which are the opposite. Plaque size is often related to a temperature-sensitive (t.s.) phenotype (see next). These mutants are often useful as unselected markers in multifactorial crosses.\u25aa\nTemperature-sensitive (t.s.): This type of mutation is very useful because it allows the isolation of conditional-lethal mutations, a powerful means of examining virus genes that are essential for replication and whose function cannot otherwise be interrupted. Temperature-sensitive mutations usually result from missense mutations in proteins (i.e., amino acid substitutions), resulting in proteins of full size with subtly altered conformation that can function at (permissive) low temperatures but not at (nonpermissive) higher ones. Generally, the mutant proteins are immunologically unaltered, which is frequently useful. These mutations are usually leaky\u2014that is, some of the normal activity is retained even at nonpermissive temperatures. Protein function is often impaired, even at permissive temperatures, therefore a high frequency of reversion is often a problem with this type of mutation because the wild-type virus replicates faster than the mutant.\u25aa\nCold-sensitive (c.s.): These mutants are the opposite of t.s. mutants and are very useful in bacteriophages and plant viruses whose host cells can be propagated at low temperatures but are less useful for animal viruses because their host cells generally will not grow at significantly lower temperatures than normal.\u25aa\nRevertants: Reverse mutation is a valid type of mutation in its own right. Most of the previous classes can undergo reverse mutation, which may be either simple back mutations (i.e., correction of the original mutation) or second-site compensatory mutations, which may be physically distant from the original mutation and not even necessarily in the same gene as the original mutation.\u25aa\nSuppression: Suppression is the inhibition of a mutant phenotype by a second suppressor mutation, which may be either in the virus genome or in that of the host cell. This mechanism of suppression is not the same as the suppression of chain-terminating amber mutations by host-encoded suppressor tRNAs (see earlier), which could be called informational suppression. Genetic suppression results in an apparently wild-type phenotype from a virus that is still genetically mutant\u2014a pseudorevertant. This phenomenon has been best studied in prokaryotic systems, but examples have been discovered in animal viruses\u2014for example, reoviruses, vaccinia, and influenza\u2014where suppression has been observed in an attenuated vaccine, leading to an apparently virulent virus. Suppression may also be important biologically in that it allows viruses to overcome the deleterious effects of mutations and therefore be positively selected.\n",

It is believed to be caused by cellular enzymes, since no virus mutants with specific recombination defects have been isolated.\u25aa\nIntramolecular recombination by copy-choice: This process occurs in RNA viruses, probably by a mechanism in which the virus polymerase switches template strands during genome synthesis. There are cellular enzymes that could be involved (e.g., splicing enzymes), but this is unlikely and the process is thought to occur essentially as a random event. Defective interfering (D.I.) particles in RNA virus infections are frequently generated in this way (see Chapter 6).\u25aa\nReassortment: In viruses with segmented genomes, the genome segments can be randomly shuffled during superinfection. Progeny viruses receive (at least) one of each of the genome segments, but probably not from a single parent. For example, influenza virus has eight genome segments; therefore, in a mixed infection, there could be 28 = 256 possible progeny viruses. Packaging mechanisms in these viruses are not well understood (see Chapter 2) but may be involved in generating reassortants.\n",

Pairs of genetic markers can be arranged on a linear map with distances measured in map units (i.e., percentage recombination frequency). In reassortment, the frequency of recombination between two markers is either very high (indicating that the markers are on two different genome segments) or comparatively low (which means that they are on the same segment). This is because the frequency of reassortment usually swamps the lower background frequency that is due to intermolecular recombination between strands.",

Recombination occurs frequently in nature; for example, influenza virus reassortment has resulted in worldwide epidemics (pandemics) that have killed millions of people (Chapter 6).

Eukaryotic cells have a diploid genome with two copies of each chromosome, each bearing its own allele of the same gene. The two chromosomes may differ in allelic markers at many loci. Among viruses, only retroviruses are truly diploid, with two complete copies of the entire genome, but some DNA viruses, such as herpesviruses, have repeated sequences and are therefore partially heterozygous. In a few (mostly enveloped) viruses, aberrant packaging of multiple genomes may occasionally result in multiploid particles that are heterozygous (e.g., up to 10% of Newcastle disease virus particles). This process is known as heterozygosis and can contribute to the genetic complexity of virus populations.",

This mixing gives the progeny virus the phenotypic properties (e.g., cell tropism) dependent on the proteins incorporated into the particle, without any genetic change. Subsequent generations of viruses inherit and display the original parental phenotypes. This process can occur easily in viruses with naked capsids (nonenveloped) that are closely related (e.g., different strains of enteroviruses) or in enveloped viruses, which need not be related to one another (Figure 3.4\n). In this latter case, the phenomenon is due to the nonspecific incorporation of different virus glycoproteins into the envelope, resulting in a mixed phenotype. Rescue of replication-defective transforming retroviruses by a helper virus is a form of pseudotyping. Phenotypic mixing has proved to be a very useful tool to examine biological properties of viruses. Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) readily forms pseudotypes containing retrovirus envelope glycoproteins, giving a plaque-forming virus with the properties of VSV but with the cell tropism of the retrovirus. This trick has been used to study the cell tropism of HIV and other retroviruses.",

In the case of phage \u03bb, the substrate packaged into the phage heads during assembly consists of long repetitive strings (concatemers) of phage DNA that are produced during the later stages of genome replication. The DNA is reeled in by the phage head, and when a complete genome length has been incorporated, the DNA is cleaved at a specific sequence by a phage-coded endonuclease (Figure 3.5\n). This enzyme leaves a 12-bp 5\u2032 overhang on the end of each of the cleaved strands, known as the cos site. Hydrogen bond formation between these sticky ends can result in the formation of a circular molecule. In a newly infected cell, the gaps on either side of the cos site are closed by DNA ligase, and it is this circular DNA that undergoes vegetative replication or integration into the bacterial chromosome. Phage T4 illustrates another molecular feature of certain linear virus genomes\u2014terminal redundancy. Replication of the T4 genome also produces long concatemers of DNA. These are cleaved by a specific endonuclease, but unlike the \u03bb genome the lengths of DNA incorporated into the particle are somewhat longer than a complete genome length (Figure 3.6\n).

The genomic organization of these viruses has evolved to pack the maximum information (six genes) into minimal space (5 kbp). This has been achieved by the use of both strands of the genome DNA and overlapping genes (Figure 3.8\n). VP1 is encoded by a dedicated open reading frame (ORF), but the VP2 and VP3 genes overlap so that VP3 is contained within VP2. The origin of replication is surrounded by noncoding regions that control transcription. Polyomaviruses also encode T-antigens, which are proteins that can be detected by sera from animals bearing polyomavirus-induced tumors. These proteins bind to the origin of replication and show complex activities in that they are involved both in DNA replication and in the transcription of virus genes.

These structures are important in DNA replication, as is a 55-kDa protein known as the terminal protein that is covalently attached to the 5\u2032 end of each strand. During genome replication, this protein acts as a primer, initiating the synthesis of new DNA strands. Although adenovirus genomes are considerably smaller than those of herpesviruses, the expression of the genetic information is rather more complex. Clusters of genes are expressed from a limited number of shared promoters. Multiple spliced mRNAs and alternative splicing patterns are used to express a variety of polypeptides from each promoter (see Chapter 5).",

There is an upper limit to the size of a nonsegmented virus genome that results from the physical properties of nucleic acids, particularly the tendency of long molecules to break due to shear forces (and, for each particular virus, the length of nucleic acid that can be packaged into the capsid). The problem of strand breakage is particularly relevant for single-stranded RNA, which is less chemically stable than double-stranded DNA. The longest single-stranded RNA genomes are those of the coronaviruses at approximately 30 kb, but the longest double-stranded DNA virus genomes are considerably longer (e.g., Mimivirus at up to 1.2 Mbp). Physical breakage of the genome results in biological inactivation, since it cannot be completely transcribed, translated, or replicated. Segmentation means that the virus avoids \u201chaving all its eggs in one basket\u201d and also reduces the probability of breakages due to shearing, thus increasing the total potential coding capacity of the entire genome. However, the disadvantage of this strategy is that all the individual genome segments must be packaged into each virus particle or the virus will be defective as a result of loss of genetic information.

The mechanism leading to transposition is different from that responsible for the initial integration of the phage genome (which is conservative in that it does not involve replication) and is a complex process requiring numerous phage-encoded and host-cell proteins. Transposition is tightly linked to replication of the phage genome and results in the formation of a co-integrate\u2014that is, a duplicate copy of the phage genome flanking a target sequence in which insertion has occurred. The original Mu genome remains in the same location where it first integrated and is joined by a second integrated genome at another site.

There are two consequences of such a transposition. First, the phage genome is replicated during this process (advantageous for the virus), and second, the sequences flanked by the two phage genomes (which form repeated sequences) are at risk of secondary rearrangements, including deletions, inversions, duplications, and translocations (possibly but not necessarily deleterious for the host cell).",

First, it is a highly error-prone process, because reverse transcriptase does not carry out the proofreading functions performed by cellular DNA-dependent polymerases. This results in the introduction of many mutations into retrovirus genomes and, consequently, rapid genetic variation (see \u201cSpontaneous Mutations,\u201d earlier). In addition, the process of reverse transcription promotes genetic recombination. Because two RNAs are packaged into each virion and used as the template for reverse transcription, recombination can and does occur between the two strands. Although the mechanism responsible for this is not clear, if one of the RNA strands differs from the other (for example, by the presence of a mutation) and recombination occurs, then the resulting virus will be genetically distinct from either of the parental viruses.",

The mature products of the pol gene are, in fact, a complex of polypeptides that include three distinct enzymatic activities: reverse transcriptase and RNAse H, which are involved in reverse transcription, and integrase, which catalyses integration of virus DNA into the host cell chromatin, after which it is known as the provirus (Figure 3.21\n). Three forms of double-stranded DNA are found in retrovirus-infected cells following reverse transcription: linear DNA and two circular forms that contain either one or two LTRs. From the structure at the ends of the provirus, it was previously believed that the two-LTR circle was the form used for integration. In recent years, systems that have been developed to study the integration of retrovirus DNA in vitro show that it is the linear form that integrates. This discrepancy can be resolved by a model in which the ends of the two LTRs are held in close proximity by the reverse transcriptase\u2013integrase complex. The net result of integration is that 1 to 2 bp are lost from the end of each LTR and 4 to 6 bp of cellular DNA are duplicated on either side of the provirus. It is unclear whether there is any specificity regarding the site of integration into the cell genome. What is obvious is that there is no simple target sequence, but it is possible that there may be (numerous) regions or sites in the eukaryotic genome that are more likely to be integration sites than others.",

There are eight genes encoded in this genome, although not all eight products have been detected in infected cells. Replication of the CaMV genome is similar to that of HBV. The first stage is the migration of the gapped virus DNA to the nucleus of the infected cell where it is repaired to form a covalently closed circle. This DNA is transcribed to produce two polyadenylated transcripts, one long (35S) and one shorter (19S). In the cytoplasm, the 19S mRNA is translated to produce a protein that forms large inclusion bodies in the cytoplasm of infected cells, and it is in these sites that the second phase of replication occurs. In these replication complexes, some copies of the 35S mRNA are translated while others are reverse transcribed and packaged into virions as they form.

While each of these theories has its devotees and this subject provokes fierce disagreements, the fact is that viruses exist, and we are all infected with them. The practical importance of the origin of viruses is that this issue may have implications for virology here and now. Genetic and nucleotide sequence relationships between viruses can reveal the origins not only of individual viruses, but also of whole families and possible superfamilies. In a number of groups of viruses previously thought to be unrelated, genome sequencing has revealed that functional regions appear to be grouped together in a similar way. The extent to which there is any sequence similarity between these regions in different viruses varies, although clearly the active sites of enzymes such as virus replicases are strongly conserved. The emphasis in these groups is more on functional and organizational similarities. The original classification scheme for viruses did not recognize a higher level grouping than the family (see Appendix 2\n), but there are now six groups of related virus families equivalent to the orders of formal biological nomenclature (Table 3.4\n).Box 3.3What do orders tell us about evolution?When the International Committee on Nomenclature of Viruses (ICTV) was created in 1966, we knew hundreds of viruses but little about most of them. This made it difficult to see how they were related to each other. Eventually it was agreed that some viruses were sufficiently similar to allow them to be grouped together as a genus\u2014in the same way that horses (Equus caballus) are in the same genus as donkeys (Equus asinus). The next step was to group similar genera (plural of genus) together as families. At that point, there was a pause for some years until it was agreed that similar virus families could be grouped into orders, of which six have now been recognized. This change happened after enough nucleotide sequence data had been accumulated to make the faint evolutionary relationships between distantly related viruses apparent. Why does it matter? In part because this is a window on the past allowing us to look back millions of years through these genetic fossils, but much more importantly because it points to what viruses are capable of and where they might be going in the future. And that\u2019s something we should all worry about.\n",
