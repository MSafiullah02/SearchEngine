This chapter focuses on the standards of care for pediatric wellness visits. These standards are not intended to be hard and fast rules but rather guidelines to follow in frequently encountered situations. These guidelines allow veterinarians to establish more consistent patient care and practice better medicine as a result of improved client understanding and compliance.",

Even clinicians within a practice have different interests and practice styles, which lead to similar cases being treated very differently within the same hospital. A written standard of care would ensure that every client, regardless of which doctor is seen, would be leaving the practice with a predictable set of information and recommendations. This is particularly important in pediatric cases because it gives each subsequent veterinarian confidence in what information and treatments were given in the prior visits. In the pediatric wellness examinations, an important part of the veterinarian's job is to educate the client. A client who hears the same or similar recommendations from different sources within the hospital is much more likely to comply with those recommendations. For example, one veterinarian in a three-doctor practice may feel that strictly indoor cats do not require feline leukemia virus (FeLV) testing. The second veterinarian may recommend testing only in multiple cat households. The third veterinarian may recommend testing for all cats but leave it up to the client to decide. Inconsistencies create confusion with clients, as well as support staff, and the client is much less likely to follow any of the recommendations given.",

Every private small animal practice experiences busy days, juggling multiple patients simultaneously. With an established set of guidelines and protocols, there is less chance of omitting a FeLV test, failing to recommend a fecal flotation, or forgetting to discuss a particular aspect of behavior and training on those busy days. The pediatric visits are more likely to become a complete health care program, both medically and behaviorally, rather than a series of vaccines and deworming.",

This is a team effort in which all doctors within the practice should contribute to create the pediatric standard of care. If everyone is able to contribute to the plan rather than having it dictated, there will be better success in following the plan that has been created. During the initial meeting, a list of areas that need standards to be developed can be generated and agreed on. The American Animal Hospital Association (AAHA), American Association of Feline Practitioners (AAFP), and Veterinary Information Network (VIN) are good resources for guidelines and can easily be tailored to fit a practice style.",

Each member of the staff needs to adhere to the plan to make sure the desired message is being delivered to the client at any point in their visit to your practice. Whether it is the receptionist, the veterinary assistant, or the technician delivering the message, the information given to the client should be the same. Regular staff meetings can be used to educate staff on the standards and to review and reinforce the protocols and standards of care. A list should be generated of the top 25 to 50 most frequently asked questions that are fielded by the receptionists and technicians, and the written answers to these questions can serve as a source or script for those staff members. Written protocols and standards of care guidelines aid in standardizing and enhancing the training of new staff members. A test bank of different topics from the pediatric wellness visits (or any other aspect of a practice) can be created, and staff members can be periodically tested on the information. For example, how often are vaccinations given, what are the available canine vs. feline vaccinations, or what are the common internal and external parasites of puppies and kittens? Once these tests are completed and scored, many practices will reward successful staff members. Rewards could be gift certificates, staff parties, or pay raises.",

Clients should understand that vaccinations are medical procedures that should be individualized based on history, physical examination, risk, and lifestyle of the individual animal. Placing emphasis on the physical examination at the first visit helps ensure that clients will return in the future for annual check-ups and recommended vaccinations, as opposed to returning simply for \u201cyearly shots.\u201d",

Generally, vaccines not recommended are those that do not induce a clinically meaningful immune response or have been associated with an adverse event, resulting in the risk outweighing the benefit. A list of these vaccines can be seen in Table 7-1\n. The initial core vaccination series is begun at the first visit, with boosters given at 3 to 4 week intervals. For example, the core puppy vaccinations (distemper-adenovirus type 2, parvovirus [DA2P]) may be given at 8, 12, and 16 weeks, and core kitten vaccinations (feline viral rhinotracheitis, calicivirus, panleukopenia [FVRCP]) given at 9 and 13 weeks. State requirements may vary, so rabies vaccines may be given at the final pediatric visit or at the time of the ovariohysterectomy or castration.",

A list of the most common pediatric intestinal parasites and their treatments can be found in Chapter 19. Puppies and kittens should be treated early and often to prevent patent infections and potential zoonotic concerns. Generally, deworming should take place at 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks of age. CAPC guidelines are as follows: \u201cPuppies and kittens require more frequent anthelmintic administration than adult dogs and cats, because (1) they often are serially reinfected via nursing and from the environment, and (2) they often harbor parasite larvae in migration that later mature and commence laying eggs. Intestinal parasite infections in puppies and kittens may cause serious illness or even death before a diagnosis is possible by fecal examination. Puppies and their mothers should be treated with appropriate anthelmintics when puppies are 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks of age, then put on a monthly preventive. Because prenatal infection does not occur in kittens, biweekly treatment can begin at 3 weeks of age, and they can be put on a monthly preventive at 8 or 9 weeks of age. Nursing bitches and queens should be treated concurrently with their offspring since they often develop patent infections along with their young.\u201d",

Many topics have multiple visual aids and informational materials available from distributors and drug companies for clients to see and take home in an effort to emphasize and reinforce the information you are providing. For example, both Hill's and Purina provide Body Condition Score charts for use when discussing nutrition and healthy body weight. CAPC provides many charts and diagrams illustrating parasite life cycles and life stages when discussing parasite control and zoonoses. Clinicians can use anatomical models when discussing breed-related dental or orthopedic concerns pets may encounter.
