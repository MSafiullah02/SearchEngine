The combination of fever, malaise, and cough was shown to have a 79% positive predictive value during the pandemic and seasonal epidemics [23,24]; however, these criteria may be not accurate in ICU patients, because other etiologies, or conditions like as postsurgery sedation, may confound the diagnosis [25]. In our study, influenza was unsuspected in 48.4% of cases. Suspicion of influenza was lower in older patients, in those admitted to the ICU for surgical conditions, in those who stayed for a longer time in hospital and ICU, and in those who did not have a cough and diffuse pulmonary infiltrates.

These data are consistent with those of Martin-Loeches et al. [34], who showed that patients from the postpandemic influenza pH1N1 period had an unexpectedly high mortality rate. Early administration of antiviral therapy has been associated with better outcome in critically ill patients [35]. In our study, although the timing to initiation of antiviral treatment was longer among patients with unsuspected influenza, a trend to lower mortality was seen in this group compared with patients with suspected influenza. A possible explanation of this finding could be that: suspected and unsuspected groups were epidemiologically very different, and the median relative viral load was lower in the unsuspected group; thus, epidemiologic and viral factors could influence the outcome in the two groups independently of the timing of antiviral treatment. Conversely, the benefit of testing will not be necessarily to the patient in terms of improved outcome due to early therapy, but more likely to preventing the nosocomial transmission of influenza.",
