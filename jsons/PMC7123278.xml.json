The leading aeronautical consultant Reg Austin reasons that UA is technically different than drone.9 Another extension of UA is the Unmanned Combat Air Vehicles [UCAV] which is armed and specifically assigned to attack each target.10 However, since the term drone has been popularized in the mainstream media, for the purposes of this paper the term UA will be interchangeably used with drones.",

Richard Newman notes that \u201cPredator became an instant hit because it could transmit live video footage of enemy actions to commanders on the ground and aircrews above the battlefield. It illuminated targets for precision weapons fired from afar. It even, on occasion, fired its own weapons, a rarity for a UAV.\u201d13 At present, Global Hawk is widely regarded to have taken over the Predator and has been flown over the Afghanistan, Bosnia, Iraq, Kosovo, Pakistan and Yemen. As one writer put it \u201cGlobal Hawk does much broader surveillance. It flies at elevations of 60,000 feet or more, like the U-2, and has higher resolution cameras than the Predator. Global Hawk can fly for nearly day and a half without being refueled, meaning it can take off from a base 1,200 miles away, loiter for 24 hours, then fly back.\u201d14 Today, the sky is no longer the exclusive domain of the birds or jumbo jets as thousands of UA are hovering all over the skies.",

Less operating costs, low fuel and maintenance costs, cheaper insurance and low salaries for the ground based personnel all translate into a lucrative monetary benefits to pursue UA for commercial purposes. Due to financial benefits associated with the UA, it is likely that UA rental business will soon sell their services.17 Manned helicopters have been used in South Africa and Australia to monitor herds during hot weather and difficult terrains but it may save time and money if UA are used to keep track of these herds.18 UA could be in hands of news channels and broadcasting companies for covering emergency events, real-time sports events, monitoring traffic accidents and war zones.19 For the first time, the United Nations has ordered surveillance drones from an Italian firm for its peacekeeping missions in Congo and diplomats hope that if successful the drones could be deployed for missions in Ivory Coast and South Sudan.20\n",

The militaries of various nations are quickly learning to develop UA capable of delivering lethal blow to the enemy taking advantage of the loopholes in the current international legal framework on the legitimate use of drones.22 In 2001, a Predator evolved into a UCAV from a reconnaissance UA when it fired a Hellfire-C laser guided missile at a tank.23 Meanwhile, the Israeli Defence Forces [IDF] have been using the UA for multiple intelligence and data gathering programs from 1980s.24 Japan has been developing the UA for dual purposes i.e. both civilian and military uses since World War II.25 The South Korean government has developed a smart vertical take-off and landing UA and is on the verge of developing an upgraded version of the US Eagle Eye tiltrotor UA.26 The Italian Air Force has its hands on a precision strike UA and Rome is negotiating a \u201cblack\u201d medium-altitude, long-endurance [MALE] project that would be flying in 2017\u20132018 told the Air Force Lt.

Article 3 of the Chicago Convention prohibits the use of weapons against civil aircrafts\u2014with a caveat that the same protection is not extended to the State aircraft in international law. In this context, one can draw a conclusion that UA do not enjoy any special immunity in international law. In reality, most states do not possess the technology to detect the stealthy UA,41 even if, they detect foreign UA the fear of repercussions of shooting down a drone would make them think twice. But recently in May 2013, the Al-Shabaab militants shot a US drone in Somalia and posted pictures on the Twitter. The US officials confirmed the incident but did not provide any specifications to drone model believed to be one of Schiebel UAVs.42 In an another case, the Russians in collaborations with Iranians observed the US drone\u2019s routes and its surveillance of Iranian skies, hacked into the drone system and forced it to land in Iran on 4 December 2011.43 The Russians helped decode American drone RQ170s intercepted by the Iranians in exchange for anti-defense air system S300.44 Despite the request by the US government to return it back, the Iranians have refused to comply and diplomatic tensions have escalated since then. Nonetheless, State reserves the right to regulate or prohibit the carriage in or above its territory in the interests of public order, safety, and above all its sovereignty.",

A distinct anomaly is observed in the question as to \u201chow an international treaty, which on the one hand prescribes that it applies only to civil aircraft [Art. 3(a)], turns around and prescribes a rule for State aircraft [Art.3(c)].\u201d50 However, Article 3 does not provide a definition but at best gives a rebuttable presumption as those aircrafts utilized in furtherance of state activities such as search and rescue, natural disasters, governmental transport, and other state related services can be categorized as State aircraft.51 This is far from a comprehensive definition and unreliable since the same Unmanned aircraft can transform into \u2018civil\u2019 or \u2018state\u2019 aircraft depending on the course of function.52\n",

            "text": "Whether UA is a \u2018civil\u2019 or \u2018state\u2019 aircraft raises different set of obligations and liabilities. If UA is a state aircraft, then UA would not come within the purview of Chicago Convention. If UA is a civil aircraft, then it would fall under the jurisdiction of ICAO and national laws. Some distinguishable characteristic of the Unmanned Aircraft for the purposes of interception and regulation can be the i) design of UA, ii) registration marks, iii) ownership, and iv) type of operation.i)Design: In 2010, CIA deployed micro UA in Pakistan, approximately the size of a pizza platter specially designed to survey targets with more precision in order to minimize civilian causalities.53 The drone operators also changed tactics by targeting terrorists in vehicles rather than residences to reduce collateral damage. However, the difficulty to distinguish UA lies in the fact when they can be easily re-modified for other purposes.ii)Registration: The registration bearings can also distinguish an aircraft. However, the nationality and registration itself are insufficient proof that an aircraft is used solely for state or civil purpose. In a well-documented case of civil airplane B-737 MisrAir flight 2843 from Cairo to Tunis, suspected of carrying terrorists under Military Police escort was intercepted by US fighter planes and forced to land in Italy. The US explained its action stating that \u201cit is our view that the aircraft was operating as a State aircraft at the time of interception. The relevant factors \u2013 including exclusive State purpose and function of the mission, the presence of armed military personnel on board and the secrecy under which the mission was attempted \u2013 compel this conclusion.\u201d54\niii)Ownership: The ownership may indicate that whether the aircraft is owned by the State or by a private entity. However, the problem arises where a state contracts out its military duties to private security contractors. For instance, the US State Department is operating surveillance drones to protect the US embassy in Iraq and is accepting bids from private security contractors to manage the drones program.55 This has outraged the Iraqi officials who believe this program is an affront to Iraqi sovereignty.56 Thus, ownership itself does not prove that the UA is used in state or a civil operation rather it further complicates the matter when the UA are contracted to private military security companies in the event liability arises.57\nIn an another case, the Elbit Systems which is a defense electronics manufacturer, trades on NASDAQ and sells Unmanned Aircraft systems to many countries around the world. Although, 45 % shares are owned by Micheal Federmann, due to its close connections with the Israeli Ministry of Defense, Elbit Systems has been a target of the pro-Palestinian BDS (boycott, divestment, sanctions) movement due to the use of its Hermes 450 drone in West Bank and Gaza.58\niv)Type of Operation: The type of operation can prove the nature of either the UA flight for civil or secret state purpose. The drone operations in Yemen planned to go after Al-Qaeda in a way that they cannot escape, qualifies these drones as state aircrafts. For example, the CIA drone operation killed Anwar al-Awlaki, an American-born leader of a Yemen Al-Qaeda network without affording him an opportunity for a trial. Besides, these drone strikes have increased resentment both against the Yemeni and the US government.59\n\n",

Bush during his 8 years in office.62 On the positive side, drones have effectively rid the world of terrorist leaders and decimated terrorist organizations in foreign countries that are infested with terrorist activity. One commentator unreservedly states that drones remain \u201ca necessary instrument of counter-terrorism\u201d.63 One of the effective achievements of drones is their ability to cut off communications of terrorist cells and destroy their training capabilities.

Post modernist thinking was geared to accepting that human culture, as we knew it from a social and economic perspective, was reaching an end. This school of thought associated itself with the momentum of industrial society, drawing on an image of pluralism of cultures and a multitude of groups. The interaction between political modernism, which brought to bear the globalization of nations and deconstruction of separatism of human society, while at the same time ascribing to the individual certain rights at international law that transcended natural legislation parameters, has been symbiotic and essentially economic. In the post modernist era, the fundamental modernist philosophy of state sovereignty and peace gave way to an industrial culture that emphasized economic coexistence for the betterment of the global citizen.",

Also in 1983, other companies, such as Summit Aviation, Investair and Westair Intl., provided the Contras with light planes, used for operations inside Nicaragua.

State Sovereignty is all about control over a society. However, it is also about legitimacy, as the Montevideo principles enunciated. It has to be noted that, from a purely academic perspective, the concept goes back several centuries. The doctrine of sovereignty was introduced to the Western world by the French philosopher Bodin. At a time when political attitudes were in transition from the dominance of the universal church to a universal legal order, Bodin introduced sovereignty as a supreme power over citizens and subjects that was not itself bound by laws. Bodin elaborated that every independent community had to consider that while acknowledging the authority of the law, a State was above the law if it wished to govern successfully. Other jurists who supported the theory of exclusive sovereignty were Hugo Grotius, who maintained that sovereign States were independent of foreign control, and Thomas Hobbes, who said that sovereignty was absolute and its misuse was unthinkable. John Locke attempted to compromise the absolute quality of sovereignty by opining that sovereignty was not absolute and unquestionable in that it was an exchange of social trust between the government and the people. Accordingly, there was an inarticulate premise that a breach of the social trust between the two parties would erode the concept of sovereignty. This brings one to the inexorable conclusion that, in the ultimate analysis the sovereignty of a nation, and therefore its independence, lies in a stable population that subscribes to the aspirations of the people. This is the ultimate value of self determination, legitimacy and independence.",

Technically, although the Chicago Convention of 1944 provides that Member States of ICAO recognize that every State has complete and exclusive sovereignty over the air space above its territory,137 the general consensus of contemporary international law is that this is not an absolute and pristine principle anymore. One commentator states very aptly:The role of the State in the modern world is a complex one. According to legal theory, each State is sovereign and equal. In reality, with the phenomenal growth in communications and consciousness, and with the constant reminder of global rivalries, not even the most powerful of States can be entirely sovereign. Interdependence and the close knit character of contemporary international commercial and political society ensures that virtually any action of a State could well have profound repercussions upon the system as a whole and the decisions under consideration by other States.138\n\n",

The essence of intervention is compulsion. The legal question with regard to the inviolability of the sovereignty of a State is not whether the intervention concerned was an armed or unarmed one, but whether it was effected unilaterally under compulsion or threat by the intervening State.139 Starke is inclined to stretch the principle of sovereignty to accommodate external involvement by a State in the affairs of another in special circumstances:\u2026\u201cSovereignty\u201d has a much more restricted meaning today than in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries when, with the emergence of powerful highly nationalised States, few limits on State autonomy were acknowledged. At the present time there is hardly a State which, in the interests of the international community, has not accepted restrictions on its liberty of action. Thus most States are members of the United Nations and the International Labour Organization (ILO), in relation to which they have undertaken obligations limiting their unfettered discretion in matters of international policy. Therefore, it is probably more accurate today to say that the sovereignty of a State means the residuum of power which it possesses within the confines laid down by international law. It is of interest to note that this conception resembles the doctrine of early writers on international, law, who treated the State as subordinate to the law of nations, then identified as part of the wider \u201claw of nature\u201d.140\n\n",

Fernando Teson143 argues that since the ultimate justification for the existence of States is the protection and enforcement of the natural rights of the citizens, a government that engages in substantial violations of human rights betrays the very purpose for which it exists and so forfeits not only its domestic legitimacy, but also its international legitimacy as well. He goes on to say:I suggest that from an ethical standpoint, the rights of States under international law are properly derived from individual rights. I therefore reject the notion that States have any autonomous moral standing - that they hold international rights that are independent from the rights of individuals who populate the State.144\n\n",

The Assembly also noted that noise concerned the public and civil aviation and was becoming a matter for concern with the increase in air traffic and that the introduction of future aircraft types could increase and aggravate the problem further unless action was taken to alleviate the problem. Accordingly, the Assembly resolved to instruct the ICAO Council to call an international conference within the machinery of ICAO as soon as possible; establish international specifications and associated guidance material relating to aircraft noise; and, to include, in the appropriate Annexes and other relevant ICAO documents and possibly in a separate Annex on noise, such material as the description and methods of measurement of aircraft noise and suitable limitations on the noise caused by aircraft that was of concern to communities in the vicinity of airports.",

Appendix C calls upon Contracting States and international Organizations to recognize the leading role of ICAO in dealing with aircraft noise and requests the former to work closely together to ensure the greatest harmonization of work in the area of environmental protection as related to air transport. In Appendix G, which relates to the problem of sonic boom, the Assembly reaffirms the importance attached to ameliorating problems caused to the public by sonic boom as a result of supersonic flight, invites States involved in the manufacture of supersonic aircraft to furnish ICAO with proposals that would meet specifications established by ICAO on the subject.",

The word \u201cnuisance\u201d remains the most uncertain word in legal terminology even though it has been put to diverse use by the judiciary. Its tentacles lie spread-eagled on a multitude of wrongs ranging from the noises made by animals to obnoxious smells. Perhaps the reason for this is due to the spontaneous human response of identifying any interference, obstruction or damage caused to an individual as a nuisance. In attempting to interpret the word \u201cnuisance\u201d the judiciary has been in a quandary. The meaning of the word \u201cnuisance\u201d has been stretched from \u201ca potential source of annoyance\u201d181 to \u201cliability for any act of obstruction of the enjoyment of a legal right\u201d.182 Though the very concept of nuisance originated to retaliate against offences of a public nature, it has since been categorized into public and private nuisance. English common law rigidly classifies a public nuisance as a crime and a private nuisance as a civil wrong.183 It is submitted that in the environmental law area it is the concept of private nuisance which is most relevant. The concept of private nuisance can be divided into a wrongful disturbance of land and a wrongful interjection of deleterious matter into land belonging to another. Therefore, private nuisance is particularly appropriate to claims founded upon excessive noise because it is directed at the interference with a person's interest in the peaceful use and enjoyment of his property. The basis of this branch of the law is the necessity of maintaining a balance between the right of an occupier to use and enjoy his property and the right of an occupier to be protected from interference or injury.184 Therefore, courts when adjudicating on environmental disputes and determining whether the tort of private nuisance is present, have to balance the equities between the parties. This chapter will attempt to trace the manner in which the Anglo Australian judiciary has dealt with nuisance in noise pollution disputes.",

This case could be contrasted with a South Australian case decided a few years later.218 The plaintiff who lived 17 ft. away from the defendant\u2019s premises claimed an injunction and \u00a3500 in damages for depreciation of the value of his house by reason of the noises made by the defendant who conducted religious services on Sundays, commencing at 7 a.m. The noises the plaintiff complained of were singing, band playing, hand clapping and walking about the hall. It was held that singing in a place of religious worship is a sound considered to be ordinarily proceeding from such a place. Although the noises complained of in the two cases are similar, the judges in the South Australian case distinguished that case from the Victorian case on the basis that the necessary inference that can be drawn from the Victorian case is that the ringing of a church bell is not considered part of the service, whereas singing is a necessary part of religious worship.

The court recognized a substantial interference of the plaintiff\u2019s rights. Although the court cites the law in New York, which is to the effect that a nuisance will be found to exist even though there is marked disparity in economic consequence between the effect of the injunction and the effect of the nuisance, yet it strangely decided to ignore it on the basis that the rule should not be followed too \u201cliterally\u201d.242 The court granted damages to the plaintiff instead of an injunction obviously because they were favourably impressed by the vast wealth of the defendant company and knew that a permanent injunction would have caused a significant loss to the company. The court may have been influenced in its decision by the loss of employment to the 300 workers of the defendant company if the court granted an injunction. However, the ability of the common law in protecting the ordinary citizen is illustrated in the English case of Halsey v. Esso Petroleum Co.

In this case the court refused to be awed by the economic position of the defendant and seemed to base the judgment on the principle that the standards binding on both parties are those of the ordinary reasonable man. Although the defendant company had taken a number of steps to abate the nuisance, the court found that an actionable nuisance existed and granted an injunction restraining the defendant from carrying on the activities which caused the nuisance. Although in both cases the court held that a nuisance existed, in the English case the court by granting an injunction prevented the recurrence of the nuisance.

Mayo J. discusses another instance when damages should be granted instead of an injunction. This is the instance when considerable time has elapsed before the plaintiff instituted legal proceedings.276 It is submitted that although such a clear statement of the law has been formulated, judges have persisted in applying subjective criteria in determining whether damages or injunctions should be granted. For instance, in Boomer v. Atlantic Cement Company,277 the judge refused to grant an injunction preventing the defendant from continuing his commercial activities which was a considerable nuisance to the plaintiff, because the judge was swayed in his judgment by the wealth of the defendant company.",

In this regard the court considered the statement of Lord Evershed M.R. in Pride of Derby and Derbyshire Angling Association LD. v. British Celanese LD.\n279 important. According to Lord Evershed M.R., if A proves that his property rights are being wrongfully interfered with by B, and that B intends to continue his wrong, then A is prima facie entitled to an injunction, and he will be deprived of that remedy only if special circumstances exist, including the circumstance that damages are an adequate remedy for the wrong that he has suffered.280 The court in Vincent v. Peacock held that instances of special circumstances would be extreme hardship, where the effect of granting an injunction would be to order someone to perform an impossibility or to abstain from doing something which is impossible for him not to do. The Supreme Court overruled the decision of the lower court which failed to grant an injunction to restrain the defendant\u2019s drunken behaviour which prevented the plaintiffs from the reasonable enjoyment of their home. The lower court seemed to have considered the facts that the offensive behaviour occurred only when the defendant was drunk and the admission of the defendant that he was an alcoholic sufficed as special circumstances for an injunction not to be granted.281 The reasoning of the lower court was based on the premise that it was futile to issue an injunction against an offender who cannot control the commission of the offence, being in a perpetual state of intoxication. It is apparent that these were not special circumstances within the rule mentioned above. Special circumstances could be interpreted by different judges in different ways as the above case illustrates.",

Love\n282 determined by the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Victoria, Australia. Disapproving of the expression \u201cmoral certainty\u201d used in an earlier case283 to describe what the plaintiff must prove, as suggesting a criminal onus of proof, the court held that there is no third onus of proof required in quia timet injunctions, lying between the civil and criminal onus. It was held by the Full Court that the plaintiff must prove that there is a real probability that the defendants\u2019 activities would cause a nuisance.284 Citing academic authority in support of their view,285 the judges held that in determining the real probability of the alleged nuisance, the relevant circumstances of the case should be taken into account, to determine whether the issuance of the injunction would be unfair to either party to the action.286 For example, in Grasso v. Love on an appeal against the granting of an injunction against the construction of a drive-in cinema, the appellants argued mainly on the grounds that evidential facts were insufficiently considered in the court of first instance which resulted in a permanent injunction against them. It was held on appeal that although the issuance of the injunction was justified to the extent that substantial damage would have been caused to the respondents who resided in a portion of the land had the injunction not been issued, it need not have applied to the entire land as there was insufficient evidence to show that the proposed drive-in cinema would have caused a nuisance to the respondents had it been erected on a portion of the land a considerable distance away from the respondents\u2019 home. Therefore, the Supreme Court considered the rights of both parties in reaching their decision. However it could be argued that \u201crelevant circumstances\u201d is a purely subjective phrase and is dependent on the interpretation given to it by courts.",

Although it could be stated that diversity in judicial opinion leads to independence in judicial thinking and that judges should not be hampered by a comprehensive definition, yet a strong argument against this type of attitude is that the law would be ambivalent when there is a multitude of judicial opinions on one point, out of which no general principle could be culled.

Noise pollution may cause or contribute to the following adverse effects: anxiety, stress, nervousness, nausea, headache, emotional instability, argumentativeness, sexual impotence, changes in mood, increase in social conflicts, neurosis, hysteria, and psychosis. Population studies have suggested associations between noise and mental-health indicators, such as rating of well-being, symptom profiles, the use of psychoactive drugs and sleeping pills, and mental-hospital admission rates. Children, the elderly, and those with underlying depression may be particularly vulnerable to these effects because they may lack adequate coping mechanisms.
