Uncertainty about the route of transmission of the virus suggests the use of respirators that can protect HCWs against both droplet nuclei and droplet transmission, rather than conventional surgical masks that are ineffective against droplet nuclei.1., 2. In particular, HCWs caring for SARS patients are recommend to wear a disposable respirator certified as at least N95 according to the US National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) standard (42 CFR 84): they must provide greater than 95% filtration of 0.3 \u03bcm sodium chloride particles at a flow rate of 85 L/min.3 A higher filtering efficiency should be requested in case of procedures likely to produce aerosols.",

With the advent of SARS, hospital protocols, largely based on the Guideline for Isolation Precautions in Hospitals,1 have been reinforced. Suspected and probable SARS cases have been isolated in a dedicated isolation ward. HCWs have been recommended to comply with contact and droplet precautions wearing disposable personal protective equipment consisting of gloves, gown, hair and shoe cover, eye-wear before entering the patient's room, and to discard them all in the anteroom. A disposable FFP2 respirator was recommended as it was extremely familiar to HCWs caring for patients with M. tuberculosis infection. Educational efforts were focused on reinforcing hand hygiene, and on implementing fit testing and seal checking of respirators, and safe removal of personal protective equipment.",
