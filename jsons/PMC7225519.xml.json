Still, independent of the target level of participation, enabling digital participation requires making it seamless for people to connect and interact with the relevant community of people but also of digital entities (see Fig. 1). Indeed, the \u201ccommunity\u201d of digital entities is essential to support the implementation of participatory processes in the digital world and even in the physical world by way of the IoT. Toward that direction, this paper introduces the concept of Social Participation Network, which captures the various entities that may potentially engage in a given digital participatory process, while abstracting the underlying heterogeneity.",

We also introduce the rules that govern the emergence of relationships among the participating entities within a network to enhance the associated participatory process, while enforcing privacy and security guarantees to participants. We then present the early design of an online service \u2013 introducing its architecture and component technologies \u2013 supporting the implementation of participatory processes based on the proposed concept of Social Participation Network (Sect. 4). Finally, we conclude with a summary of our contribution and the research challenges ahead of us (Sect. 5).",

Open data is among the pioneer implementation of open government in today\u2019s digital era. Still, there exist various implementations of the concept [16], which differ according to the level of participation, from the citizen being a mere consumer to an actor, of the government actions. Accordingly, a number of software tools support the open data movement, from the management of data to engaging developers in the creation of new applications as Open Government Data as a Service illustrates [20]. The proper organization of the exposed data is in particular essential to avoid misinterpretations and requires appropriate visualization tools. Still in the direction of leveraging digital technologies for opening up government knowledge and practices, agencies have applied crowdsourcing to foster civic participation at a massive scale for top-down politics, reform discussion and e-voting. Examples are many and include: the constitution reform in Iceland [17], open ministry in Finland [8] and open innovation strategies [7]. According to Aitamurto [1], crowdsourcing with co-creation constitutes the main method for realizing participatory democracy.",

We are currently analyzing the rich literature on digital participation in order to discover the core set of rules for participation. However, we do not pretend to introduce a fixed set, other rules can be added during the design phase of a participatory process to meet specific needs.

We have previously introduced the social middleware solution to address such interoperability requirements [2].

The architecture includes the Event Handler Service as a Node.js (www.nodejs.org) and Express (www.expressjs.com) application. Actors, in a given participatory context, then trigger events such as engagesIn and showsInterestIn, which are published to a message broker such as RabbitMQ (www.rabbitmq.com) (see Publish event in Fig. 3). The Event Handler Service consumes events from the message broker (see Consume event in Fig. 3), which it evaluates using the Rule Engine and Knowledge Base containing the social participation network rules we presented in Sect. 3.2 (see Event evaluation in Fig. 3). The rules are stored in a MongoDB (www.mongodb.com) database as Json documents. If the event evaluation triggers an operation, the social participation network graph structure is updated accordingly (see operation in Fig. 3), where we leverage the graph-oriented database Neo4j (www.neo4j.com), to store the social participation network graph. Finally, actors receive an updated version of the social participation network graph that concerns them (see Publish update and Consume update in Fig. 3).",

The main goal is to protect information such as who are the participants, their personal and private data and their participation contributions. This example shows the two main levels of participatory process isolation: Service provider-level: The isolation is at the level of the party -or consortium- interested in setting up the participatory process. The interested parties act as service providers, as they host an OSNS for the participation instance -or are responsible for finding an appropriate host-.Participatory context-level: The isolation is at the level of participants contributions and interactions. All information remains isolated among different participatory contexts even within the same service provider.\n",

We are also studying the definition of additional social participation network rules to automatically learn and adapt the embedded participatory links. We also plan to evaluate our work both by simulations of participatory contexts and by running small real use cases. Finally, it is crucial to address key challenges facing digital participation, such as the digital divide since not everyone has Internet access and/or is digital literate, and improving the level of engagement by supporting the right participation incentives.",
