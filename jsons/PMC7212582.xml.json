            "text": "Public health emergency preparedness (PHEP) refers to \u201cthe capability of the public health and healthcare systems, communities, and individuals, to prevent, protect against, quickly respond to, and recover from health emergencies, particularly those whose scale, timing, or unpredictability threatens to overwhelm routine capabilities\u201d [1]. In this interaction between public health authorities and community members, it is clear that synergies benefit the eventual response and recovery after an outbreak occurs. The term \u2018synergies\u2019 here refers to the added value that derives from the process and outcome of two or more stakeholders or sets of stakeholders working together towards a common goal. Stakeholders could be either from the community, or they could be institutional. The benefits that are gained through working together are more than either could have achieved alone, and these benefits are, most likely, also mutually shared. \u2018Community\u2019 refers here to populations that may be directly affected by, or that may be at risk from the disease in question, or to networks of stakeholders who are linked to these affected populations and who may be able to assist in the process of solving or mitigating the problem [2]. Such actors may pre-exist in the civic or public realm in the form of stakeholder groups, each with their own interests, sub-cultures and specific expertise, or they may emerge during emergency events in the form of new coalitions. Overall, the community is seen as distinct from the government authorities who are formally and legally tasked with addressing the disease.",

Observations have been made critiquing both the community engagement process and the outcomes of these efforts, and they have also highlighted the failed collaborations between anthropologists and outbreak response agencies [10]. Not until the 2014\u20132016 West African Ebola outbreak has the potential role of communities in PHEP become recognized more widely, specifically insofar as communities may be seen as collaborators whose capacities, insights, and skills need to be effectively incorporated into the response to public health emergencies [11\u201313]. Because successful community engagement processes are often hampered by institutional preferences for pre-packaged and top-down approaches, concerns have been raised about the sustainability of these efforts, while the need to understand broad assumptions about community capacity, motivations, interest to participate, and the reasons for lack of trust between agencies and communities has also been stressed [14\u201316].",

This approach reflects the call by the 2015 Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction for a broader, more people-centred preventive approach through engagement with all relevant stakeholders [17]. Similarly, the need for the public sectors, civil society organizations, and scientific research institutions to work together more closely and to create opportunities for collaboration is also emphasized in EU Decision 1082/2013/EU (October 2013) on serious cross-border threats to health [18]. In this context, the question has emerged what the most effective way is to assess such synergies in order to provide information about good practices to interested stakeholders.",

We found no previously published accounts of methodological approaches for conducting assessments of community-government synergies in PHEP. This paper contributes to the development of an approach that helps to identifying actual and potential synergies, thereby facilitating trust and effective collaboration between institutional authorities and affected communities before, during and after public health events. The approach described has been inspired on previous experience conducting after event assessments of disease outbreaks [19, 20] and experience with ethnographic research on community health resources [21, 22].",

The period of observation started in 2016 with the initial development of a literature review that was conducted to identify enablers and barriers to community and institutional synergies in emergency preparedness [23, 24]. After this, case studies were conducted in four EU/EEA countries in 2017 and- 2018: Spain, the Netherlands, Iceland and Ireland. The aim of these studies was to obtain good practices regarding PHEP synergies between institutional authorities and the communities studied. Two studies involved tick-borne disease events, both of which took place in 2016: Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) in Spain, and tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) in the Netherlands [25\u201327], and two outbreaks of acute gastroenteritis which took place in 2017\u20132018, verocytotoxin-producing Escherichia coli (VTEC) in Ireland, and norovirus in Iceland. All case studies dealt with relatively small events in terms of case numbers. These studies were conducted in collaboration with the national public health authorities in the four countries and with the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). The methodological approach of these case studies was influenced by previous experience with after event assessment by ECDC on Middle East respiratory syndrome and polio [19, 20, 28].",

The overall objective of the assessment is to identify synergies between institutional decision-making bodies and community actors and networks before, during and after an outbreak response to a given public health emergency. The analytical framework chosen to organise the study involved the preparedness cycle [29]. Within this framework, the pre-incident phase involves preparation and planning; the incident phase involves management, monitoring, investigation, and intervention; and the post-incident phase involves recovery and identifying lessons learned. The assessment focuses on the specific actions undertaken by the participating countries\u2019 public health and other authorities in relation to community engagement, as well as the view from the perspective of the community. The methodology is generic, process oriented, and could be applied to a majority of public health emergencies, zoonotic or otherwise. Overall, the approach can be characterized as a Grounded Theory approach [30], which sets out to discover or construct theory from data that is systematically obtained and analysed using comparative analysis in an iterative manner.",

Other criteria included the level to which the event had involved an inter-sectoral response, its community impact, biosafety level of the event, cross border issues, and the proposed study timeline. The eventually selected case studies together describe a wider variety of disease outbreak experiences according to the typology shown in Table 2. The typology is based on the extent to which the event was expected by involved stakeholders relative to the biosafety classification of the disease, the latter according to Directive 2000/54/EC of the European Parliament [31]. The typology suggests that the core principles identified are likely relevant to many other disease categories, including larger events, that fall within this typology.\n",

During the fieldwork phase the core team was joined by the NFP or a close colleague representing the authorities over the course of data collection. The chance for this person to engage in a four-day dialogue with community partners was often experienced as enriching for all parties involved and created in-situ opportunities for synergies to develop or the identification of barriers that had previously not been recognized. The opportunity to ethnographically reflect upon and document this experience further helped to identify possible or actual synergies. During the \u201chot debrief\u201d the last day of fieldwork, the dialogue between authorities involved, the fieldworkers, and ECDC stakeholders typically allowed for a limited prioritisation of the most relevant findings.

While it may be tempting to try to find out the \u201cright\u201d perspectives, often different versions of reality can co-exist in the social domain. With regard to the assessment of community engagement, it is crucial that all the versions of events promoted by different community actors are taken seriously, as discourses and ideas determine social action as much as \u2013 if not more than \u2013 hard, scientific facts [35]. This \u201cconstructivist\u201d perspective suggests that the goal of the assessment should not be to delineate the \u201ccorrect\u201d from the \u201cfalse\u201d, but rather to compare and contrast different versions \u2013 also referred to as \u201cframes\u201d \u2013 of what happened, identifying agreements and disagreements, and how these may have led to particular actions during an outbreak. In the context of emergency response this is not always without challenges, as medical professional culture is generally inclined to favour a positivist scientific approach in which factual, biomedical knowledge is perceived to be the only \u201ccorrect\u201d way of understanding disease outbreaks events. For researchers in the field, this situation therefore demands proper training in social science techniques. Central is the ability to be reflexive about the fieldworkers\u2019 own values and position, in order to distinguish a researcher\u2019s own biases and assumptions from those of the voices obtained in the field [36, 37]. Why do we see a phenomenon one way or another? What biases and assumptions determine how we look at an event? Recognition of the need for such questions is inherently an acknowledgement that the orientations of researchers will be shaped by their own socio-historical background.",

As there is no one way of seeing and defining \u201ccommunity\u201d, the entire idea of community engagement during an outbreak also may shift according to context or situation. It is this type of sensitivity which is necessary to conduct quality data collection and analysis. It demands reflexivity not only towards oneself, but in the entire methodology of the assessment. Moreover, such reflexivity helps to find sensitivity when perspectives on the same event are in disagreement and group tensions become visible. For example, it is not unlikely that some people may be upset by the findings \u2013 e.g. the authorities will say that the community doesn\u2019t appreciate their work, or the community will say that the authorities never listen. This creates an important but challenging divergence of views, and it is here that a social scientist will move in to try to disentangle what has happened through using reflexivity and sensitivity in how they present the findings.",

For this reason, the significance of working with the ECDC NFPs in advance of and during the country visits is crucial to develop an effective and efficient program. The NFP identifies the most relevant interviewee and FGD participants, as well as the key documents, which consequently maximises both the range and quality of the data collected within the time constraints. The disadvantage of this approach is of course the possibility that depending on the social network of the particular NFP, some respondents may be left out or not. A possible remedy here is to conduct a more formal stakeholder analysis not dependent on the experience of the focal point to support the selection of respondents previous to fieldwork. However, because we asked each participant to briefly draw an informal map with everyone they had interacted with, we relatively quickly identified groups that had not been mentioned or listed, and were able to make last-minute additional appointments or inquiries if necessary. It is well known that during disease outbreaks certain groups of actors may emerge as relevant that were before not recognized. Our participatory mapping was able to quickly identify these groups.",

However, mapping the characteristics of the case studies out on a typology (see Table 2) helped overcome this limitation to some extent, as the exercise showed how the case study addressed characteristics that are generalizable to other disease categories and contexts. Previous experience from the multi-country ECDC case study work indicates that some findings may be sufficiently generic as to be potentially applicable in several countries. Further, as we conducted more case studies, overlapping themes started to emerge, leading to a fairly robust set of findings that built on this expanding dataset and that we believe is applicable for the promotion of community engagement in many if not most of the EU/EEA, candidate and/or European Neighbourhood countries.",

We believe that this combination of an outsider perspective being supported by insider knowledge can produce very strong findings. In addition, we generally used an anthropological approach in our field research, which builds upon professional experience and expertise with cultural diversity and openness to differences in interpretation of the same event.

This made transferability of the findings each of the case studies harder to evaluate from the reports alone. However, richer descriptions can also be obtained with the methodology; the limiting choice of style in this case was institutional. For our own studies, we remedied this situation with two separate team meetings where the teams across case studies came together for 2 days to discuss and evaluate common points of good practice. In this process, discussions of interpretations were central, and we noted that robust, overlapping themes emerged, nevertheless.

Instead, the results often came together through the voices of many, each contributing their part, and the triangulation of observations across researchers within the team afterward further increased the dependability of findings. Of course, the timing of the after event review does influence the dependability. Overall, we ensured that the outbreaks to be investigated should have taken place within the previous 3 years in order to avoid major memory recall problems.

We also believe the findings had a transformative potential, because the dialogical approach during interviewing complemented by the inclusion of a representative from the authorities at each interview (who was there to listen and learn), helped to motivate community consensus towards the usefulness and meaningfulness of the findings for future action and further steps.

The methodology is generic and could be applied to a majority of public health emergencies, zoonotic or otherwise. It highlights the importance of dialogue during preparation and planning, and interviewer reflexivity during fieldwork. The assessment can be done in a relatively short time, and while the design limits the number of individuals and institutions involved, the insider-outsider collaboration with local focal points allows for a rich fieldwork experience in which many of the relevant angles are still addressed. Comparing the outcomes with quality indicators for qualitative research, the outcomes generally show good trustworthiness.
