In many cases, when fresh tissue is not available for culture, pathologists can provide a rapid morphologic diagnosis and facilitate clinical decisions in patient treatment.2 In addition, pathologists have played a central role in the identification of emerging and reemerging infectious agents and describing the pathogenetic processes of emerging diseases, such as hantavirus pulmonary syndrome and other viral hemorrhagic fevers, leptospirosis, and rickettsial and ehrlichial infections as well as the diagnosis of anthrax during the bioterrorist attack of 2001.3, 4, 5, 6, 7\n",

However, serologic results can be difficult to interpret in the setting of immunosuppression or when only a single sample is available for evaluation. In addition, fresh tissue is not always available for culture, and culture of fastidious pathogens can be difficult and may take weeks or months to yield results. Moreover, culture alone cannot distinguish colonization from tissue invasion. Some microorganisms have distinctive morphologic characteristics that allow their identification in formalinfixed tissues using routine and special stains. Nevertheless, in several instances it is difficult or even impossible to identify an infectious agent specifically by conventional morphologic methods.",

There has been an increasing interest in the use of specific antibodies to viral, bacterial, fungal and parasitic antigens in the detection and identification of the causative agents in many infectious diseases. The use of a specific antibody to detect a microbial antigen was first performed by Coons and associates8 to detect pneumococcal antigen in tissues. The advantages of immunohistochemistry over conventional staining methods (Table 2.1\n) and the contributions of immunohistochemistry in infectious diseases (Table 2.2\n) are substantial. It is important to emphasize that both monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies must be tested for possible cross-reactivities with other organisms. The widespread occurrence of common antigens among bacteria and pathogenic fungi is well established.1,\n9 Finally it is important to understand that immunohistochemistry has several steps and all of them can affect the final result; however, in general the only limitations are the availability of specific antibodies and the preservation of epitopes.1,\n10 It is well known that for larger microorganisms such as protozoa, fungi and some bacteria, pretreatment of formalinfixed, paraffin-embedded tissue is not required. In contrast, for smaller infectious agents, for example, microorganisms such as viruses and chlamydiae, pretreatment of the tissue with proteolytic enzymes or heat-induced epitope retrieval is necessary in order to enhance immunoreactivity.",

In other instances, there may be so little hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) that it cannot be demonstrated by techniques such as orcein staining. In these cases, immunohistochemical techniques to detect HBsAg are more sensitive than histochemical methods and are helpful in reaching the diagnosis.13 Immunostaining for HBsAg has been used in the diagnosis of hepatitis B and in the study of carrier states.14,\n15 Eighty percent or more of cases with positive serologic results for HBsAg demonstrate cytoplasmic HBsAg using immunohistochemistry (Fig. 2.1\n).16 By immunoperoxidase localization, hepatitis B core antigen (HBcAg) can be demonstrated within the nuclei or the cytoplasm of hepatocytes, or both (Fig. 2.2\n). Predominantly cytoplasmic expression of HBcAg is associated with a higher grade of hepatitis activity.17\n",

Histologic diagnosis of CMV in fixed tissues usually rests on the identification of characteristic cytopathic effects, including intranuclear or cytoplasmic inclusions, or both. However, histologic examination lacks sensitivity, and in some cases atypical cytopathic features can be confused with reactive or degenerative changes.43 In these cases, immunohistochemistry using monoclonal antibodies against early and late CMV antigens allows the detection of CMV antigens in the nucleus and cytoplasm of infected cells (Fig. 2.4\n). In addition, immunohistochemistry may allow detection of CMV antigens early in the course of the disease when cytopathic changes have not yet developed.44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49 For example, CMV early nuclear antigen is expressed 9 to 96 hours after cellular infection and indicates early active viral replication. Immunohistochemistry has been useful in the detection of CMV infection in patients with steroid refractory ulcerative colitis, and in detecting occult CMV infection of the central nervous system in liver transplant patients who develop neurological complications.50,\n51 It has also been used to demonstrate a high frequency of CMV antigens in tissues from first trimester abortions.52 The sensitivity of immunohistochemistry is better than light microscopic identification of viral inclusions and compares favorably with culture and in situ hybridization.44, 46, 47, 49, 53 Additionally, immunohistochemical assays can be completed faster than the shell vial technique, with immunofluorescence, or culture allowing for rapid results that are important for early anti-CMV therapy.49\n",

However, in some cases, the infection may contain only rare cells showing the characteristic cytopathic effect.57 In addition, other viral inclusions, including CMV, human papillomavirus, HSV, and VZV, can be mistaken for adenovirus inclusions and vice versa. Moreover, in immunosuppressed patients the incidence of coinfection with other viruses is high. In these circumstances immunohistochemical assay may be necessary for a definitive diagnosis. A monoclonal antibody that is reactive with all 41 serotypes of adenovirus has been used in an immunohistochemical technique to demonstrate intranuclear adenoviral antigen in immunocompromised patients (Fig. 2.5\n).57, 58, 59, 60, 61 Histologic diagnosis of adenovirus colitis is difficult, and it is usually underdiagnosed.

Immunohistochemistry can also be helpful when more than one fungus is present; in these cases dual immunostaining techniques can highlight the different fungal species present in the tissue.173 An important limitation of immunohistochemistry in the identification of fungi is the well-known, widespread occurrence of common antigens among pathogenic fungi that frequently results in cross-reactivity with polyclonal antibodies and even with some monoclonal antibodies.169, 171, 172, 173, 174 Therefore, assessment of cross-reactivity using a panel of fungi is a very important step in the evaluation of immunohistochemical methods.169,\n170\n",
