            "text": "Opportunistic infections occur when loss of established innate or adaptive immune responses allow an organism that is normally weakly virulent to cause infection. The type and degree of immune defect dictate the profile of potential opportunistic pathogens (Table 1\n). Infections commonly encountered in healthy individuals should not be forgotten as they can also cause infection in immunocompromised hosts. Opportunistic lung infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality for patients immunocompromised because of HIV infection, haematological malignancy, aplastic anaemia or chemotherapy treatment, or who are recipients of solid-organ or stem cell transplants, and also may complicate treatment with the new biological therapies for inflammatory conditions.1 Expert clinical assessment with early diagnosis and aggressive treatment are required for a positive outcome. The CT scan is more sensitive than the chest radiograph at defining the predominant pattern(s) of lung involvement, and when combined with knowledge of the patient's immune status (loss of T-cell or antibody-mediated immunity, or defects in neutrophil-mediated immunity) can often identify the most likely pathogens. This review provides a concise overview of the most common opportunistic lung infections.",

CMV infection is defined as active CMV replication regardless of symptoms or signs, whilst CMV disease is infection associated with evidence of organ-specific disease. CMV infection in immunocompromised patients is usually due to reactivation of latent CMV acquired in early life, but can also be primary infection in previously uninfected individuals, in whom it is often more severe. Pneumonitis is an important complication, and commonly presents with insidious onset of fever, malaise, cough and dyspnoea with hypoxia. Classic features on CT scan are symmetrical peribronchovascular and alveolar infiltrates predominantly affecting the lower lobes, but asymmetric changes, consolidation and effusions are not uncommon.",

The organisms involved are more diverse than those seen in conventional pneumonia and include both Gram-positive (Streptococcus pneumoniae, Staphylococcus aureus) and Gram-negative (e.g. Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Proteus species, Escherichia coli and other enteric pathogens) organisms, which require treatment with antibiotics that are effective against a large range of bacteria, including P. aeruginosa.",

Nocardia are found in soil, decaying vegetable matter and stagnant water. Inhalation is the commonest route of entry so pneumonia is the commonest infection. The main risk factors are defects in T-cell mediated immunity (e.g. post-transplantation), prolonged glucocorticoid therapy, malignancy, graft versus host disease (GVHD), diabetes mellitus, chronic granulomatous disease and alveolar proteinosis. Nocardia pneumonia usually develops over weeks with cough, haemoptysis, weight loss, fever and night sweats but can be more acute. Common radiological features are patches of dense consolidation or macronodules, frequently pleurally based. Cavitation and pleural effusions are common. These appearances can be mistaken for metastasis. Local spread to the pericardium and mediastinum, and haematogenous spread to brain, joints and soft tissue occur in about half of patients. The diagnosis can be made rapidly through identification of characteristic beaded, branching Gram-positive and weakly acid-fast filaments on microscopy. Blood and sputum cultures can be positive but require prolonged aerobic culture. Susceptibility to antibiotics varies among the Nocardia sp. and treatment with two or three intravenous antibiotics may be necessary initially in immunocompromised individuals.6 Trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole is first-line therapy, with carbapenems, amikacin, third-generation cephalosporins, tetracyclines or amoxicillin\u2013clavulanate as alternatives. Duration of treatment is prolonged \u2013 up to 12 months in immunocompromised patients and central nervous system (CNS) disease.",

Clinical presentation is classically insidious with slowly increasing dyspnoea, dry cough and hypoxaemia with few physical or radiologic findings, but can be fulminant.7 Exercise-induced oxygen desaturation is a sensitive marker. The chest radiograph features are diffuse, bilateral, interstitial infiltrates but can be normal, whereas high-resolution CT scan is much more sensitive and often shows extensive ground glass opacities with an apical distribution and peripheral sparing. Pneumatocoeles are not uncommon, and chronic infection can lead to bizarre-looking cystic changes. PJP cannot be cultured and diagnosis requires identification of the organism in induced sputum or BALF by microscopy with Giemsa and Grocott stains. Immunofluorescence and PCR techniques increase the diagnostic yield but false-positive PCR can occur due to PJP lung colonization. P. jirovecii can be found in BALF for 48\u201372 hours after starting empirical treatment. First-line treatment is high-dose trimethoprim\u2013sulfamethoxazole for 21 days, with adjunctive corticosteroids for severe hypoxaemia (pO2 <8 kPa) (Table 3). Second-line therapies include clindamycin plus primaquine, pentamidine, atovaquone, or trimethoprim plus dapsone. Prophylaxis with trimethoprim\u2013sulphamethoxazole or nebulized pentamidine is recommended in patients with HIV infection (CD4 count <200 cells/mm3), transplant recipients (solid organ and haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT)) and those receiving prolonged high-dose glucocorticoids (>20 mg/day for 21 days or longer).1 Mortality is about 10%.8\n",

Chronic graft versus host disease (GVHD) is also a significant risk factor and, rarely, patients with chronic lung disease or milder forms of immunosuppression can develop semi-invasive forms of aspergillosis. The most common infective species is Aspergillus fumigatus.9 The respiratory tract (including the sinuses) is most often affected, although blood-borne spread to internal organs (especially the CNS) and skin can occur. The classic presenting triad in invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) is fever, chest pain and haemoptysis, although fever alone or various respiratory symptoms can occur. Aspergillus has a predilection for growing into blood vessels, potentially causing fatal massive haemorrhage. Chest radiographs show patchy infiltrates or nodules that can cavitate. CT scan features include macronodules (single or multiple, with or without cavitation), or patchy consolidation. Nodules may show the \u2018halo\u2019 (surrounding ground glass infiltrates due to haemorrhage) or \u2018air-crescent\u2019 (cavitation around a fungal ball) signs. When the patient's immune function recovers, fungal balls may form in a walled-off cavity created by the invasive phase of the disease. Other manifestations of invasive aspergillus infections affecting the lung include:\u2022\nAspergillus tracheobronchitis, in which infection is restricted to the tracheobronchial tree causing a relentless cough. CT scans may show focal bronchial wall thickening and \u2018tree and bud\u2019 changes. Bronchoscopy is diagnostic, identifying highly inflamed mucosa with necrotic white slough that is positive on culture and histology for Aspergillus.\u2022Chronic necrotizing pulmonary aspergillosis (CNPA) or chronic cavitatory pulmonary aspergillosis (CCPA), which are more indolent forms of invasive aspergillosis associated with mild immunosuppression or chronic lung disease. These present with a long history of cough and frequently with marked systemic symptoms, and a slowly progressive patch of consolidation with or without cavitation (CNPA), or an expanding dry upper lobe cavity with a thickened wall (CCPA).10\n\n",

Reactivation of latent infection can occur in immunocompromised patients, especially with defects in T-cell-mediated immunity, so a history of travel or residence in a high-risk area can be relevant. Common endemic fungi causing pulmonary infections include Histoplasma capsulatum, Coccidioides (Coccidioides immitis and Coccidioides posadasii), Blastomyces dermatitidis and Sporothrix schenckii.15 Presentation varies with pathogen but tends to mimic tuberculosis with cavitating pneumonias, pulmonary nodules, enlarged mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes, or a miliary pattern. Systemic dissemination is not uncommon in immunocompromised patients. Diagnosis requires identification of the fungus in respiratory samples or biopsy material, including bone marrow aspirates. Culture may take 6 weeks. H. capsulatum can be rapidly detected with an antigen detection assay but this may cross-react with other endemic fungi.16 Serology will identify patients with previous exposure for most fungi, but is not reliable in immunocompromised patients. Mortality is high without timely appropriate treatment.",
