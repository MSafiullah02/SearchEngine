The 1997 Hong Kong outbreak of avian influenza A (H5N1) marked the first documented account of human infection with an avian-specific influenza virus. This first outbreak resulted in severe disease in 18 humans, of which six were fatal. This particular outbreak took place concurrently with an outbreak of the same strain of virus in the poultry population of Hong Kong.6 Scientists determined that all cases had had close contact with infected poultry. Further genetic studies showed that in all likelihood, the virus had jumped directly from birds to humans.6 Quick response by Chinese authorities led to the destruction of Hong Kong\u2019s entire poultry population (around 1.5 million birds). This may have avoided a global influenza pandemic.",

Hosts will have not been exposed previously to these unique viruses; therefore, they will not possess immunity to the new subtypes. Existing vaccines may not offer protection from novel viruses either. It is thought that antigenic shift has resulted in lethal pandemics in the past. If this were to happen to an avian-specific virus such as H5N1, the unique subtype would possess genes from human influenza viruses that make it readily transmissible from person to person for a lasting period of time.",

Therefore, the viruses are thought to mix with each other within pigs. It is thought that in Southeast Asia, where humans live and interact in close proximity to poultry and pigs, the environment may be favorable for antigenic shift to occur. More recently researchers have suggested that for some avian influenza viruses, humans themselves may serve as the \u201ctest tube\u201d in which mixing may occur.6 That is, if a human is concurrently infected with both an avian influenza A virus and a human strain, the two may mix and produce a novel strain more easily transmitted among humans. If such a mixing were to occur with a high pathogenic strain, such as H5N1, the results may be a global pandemic.",

It has been shown that afflicted birds that survive may excrete virus for at least 10 days in their feces.6 The infection seems to be passed along between both domestic birds and migratory wild birds. Transmission of viruses from animals to humans depends on the characteristics of the pathogen, the concentration of infected host animals, and how often humans come in contact with the infected hosts.12 In large portions of Southeast Asia, it is common practice for whole households to live and work in very close contact with poultry and other animals. Because the avian influenza A (H5N1) virus is known to be transmitted through contact with infected bird oral secretions and feces, these close living relationships facilitate interspecies transmission.

However, the cases published have reported the clinical presentation of a typical influenza-like illness with evidence of pneumonia. Patients developed symptoms including fever, cough, sore throat, conjunctivitis, myalgias, and dyspnea. In some outbreaks, specifically the Hong Kong outbreak in 1997, gastrointestinal manifestations, including abdominal pain, vomiting, and diarrhea were prominent.4 However, more recent outbreaks have been lacking predominant gastrointestinal manifestations.14 In one study, symptom onset tended to occur two to four days after exposure to presumed infected birds.9 In several of the fatal cases, severe respiratory distress leading to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) ensued secondary to viral pneumonia.4, 9, 10, 14 Previously healthy adults, children, and some with chronic medical illnesses, were affected. Leukopenia on presentation may be the most significant adverse prognostic indicator.4, 9, 14 As of January 2006, the mortality rate was approximately 55% (Fig 1).15 Mortality of infection does not respect any age boundaries (Fig 1) One published report of five individuals having confirmed infections with H5N1 in Thailand in 2004 described the clinical course of four male children (ages 6 to 7) and one female adult (age 58). None had preexisting illnesses; all succumbed to the infection. They presented with symptoms including fever, sore throat, rhinorrhea, cough, myalgias, and dyspnea. They were admitted to a hospital on days two through six after onset of symptoms. All experienced respiratory failure and required intubation at a median of seven days (range, 4 to 10 days) after onset of illness. Three of the children died two to four weeks after onset of symptoms, and one child and the adult died eight days after onset of symptoms.14\n",

These two measures would decrease human exposure to H5N1 and decrease likelihood of mixing of H5N1 with human-specific viruses. The WHO specifically recommends workers involved in the culling of poultry flocks take protective measures to decrease exposure to bird excrement. Protective clothing and gear as well as proper cleaning of surfaces must be employed. The WHO also reports that poultry workers in areas with outbreaks should receive antiviral drugs as prophylaxis. Proper reporting to local and state officials is a must when cases of avian influenza are found in humans. Public health is dependent on the dissemination of pertinent information. Officials need to assess the virology of circulating animal and human infections to best assess vaccination needs and other protective measures.6\n",
