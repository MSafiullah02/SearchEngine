As noted in an earlier editorial (5), there are myriad negative physical and mental health outcomes that are linked to the older adult experiencing loneliness and/or social isolation. While issues of loneliness and social isolation can often be overlooked by health and social service professionals, the COVID-19 pandemic has focused increased attention on social isolation and loneliness for all ages, particularly older adults as the most vulnerable, at-risk segment of the population.",

With sheltering-in-place and stay-at-home orders, many older adults lost usual ways to connect with support networks and health and social service providers and are spending increased time alone. Many of the traditional strategies for engaging older adults have become obsolete in the new normal. Congregate meal sites, exercise and social activities, in-person health/business interactions, and volunteer and employment commitments are among those engagement opportunities that are suspended.",

Having had to quickly respond during the pandemic necessitated the use of technology that was previously unfamiliar for both professionals and older adults and planning in a time of little, often conflicting information and rapidly evolving status. Once the crisis has passed, we can evaluate our responses and identify those strategies that worked and can become a part of our practice approaches. For example, we moved forward to develop a telehealth delivery platform to facilitate Circle of Friends for use during the crisis and beyond. With social workers embracing the use of technology as a viable service-delivery option, traditional interventions can similarly be offered (e.g., exercise, dementia care, and caregiver support) as well as more innovative options (e.g., interactive photo sharing, support and learning assistants, online-based websites for pairing runners and cooks with isolated older adults, and multi-party games) (19). In addition, there will be a need to learn to identify Post Traumatic Stress Disorder. Symptoms such as fear, sleeping disturbances, poor concentration and flash backs. In the future, we may see more social worker interactions carried out through digital connections along with increasing use of \u201cAlexa\u201d and a variety of health robots to help alleviate loneliness.\u2020 Continuing to combat ageism\u2014now that the majority of our society has experienced loneliness and social isolation, there is better understanding of the need to not perpetuate it in a post-pandemic world, particularly with older adults.
