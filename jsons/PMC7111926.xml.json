            "text": "\nChilo iridescent virus (CIV), also known as Invertebrate iridescent virus 6, belongs to the family Iridoviridae and is the type species of the genus Iridovirus (Fauquet et al., 2005, Williams, 1996, Williams et al., 2005, Willis, 1990). Iridoviruses are large, cytoplasmic, icosahedral viruses with a linear double-stranded DNA genome, which is both circularly permuted and terminally redundant (Darai et al., 1983, Goorha & Murti, 1982). The CIV virion consists of an unusual three layer structure containing an outer proteinaceous capsid, an intermediate lipid membrane, and a core DNA\u2013protein complex containing the 212, 482 bp genome (Jakob et al., 2001, Williams, 1996, Williams et al., 2005). Up to now, thirteen complete sequences of iridovirus genomes have been published, including CIV (Huang et al., 2009, Williams et al., 2005). The availability of the CIV sequence facilitates the identification and functional analysis of the proteome of CIV virions. Replication of CIV occurs in the nucleus of infected cells and the assembly takes place in the cytoplasm (Goorha and Murti, 1982).",

Viral structural proteins are likely to play crucial roles in these processes. Initiation of viral transcription for instance requires one or more virion proteins, since CIV DNA alone is not infectious, similar to what has been shown for the vertebrate iridovirus Frog virus 3 (Willis and Granoff, 1985). In previous studies, efforts have been made to characterize the polypeptides in CIV virions by one- or two-dimensional SDS-PAGE. The presence of 21\u201328 polypeptides was revealed by one-dimensional SDS-PAGE, while 35 polypeptides were observed in two-dimensional SDS-PAGE (Barray & Devauchelle, 1979, Barray & Devauchelle, 1985, Cerutti & Devauchelle, 1985, Kelly & Tinsley, 1972, Orange & Devauchelle, 1987). The size of these polypeptides ranged from 11 to 300 kDa. However, most of these proteins were not further characterized and it is unknown, except for the major capsid protein MCP, by which CIV genes they are encoded.",

Staining of the gel with colloidal blue revealed at least 21 proteins ranging from 10 to 250 kDa (Fig. 1\n) much in line to what has been found previously (Barray & Devauchelle, 1979, Barray & Devauchelle, 1985, Cerutti & Devauchelle, 1985, Kelly & Tinsley, 1972, Orange & Devauchelle, 1987). The gel lane was divided into 6 slices containing proteins with a molecular mass lower than 26 kDa, ranging from 26\u201334 kDa, 34\u201343 kDa, 43\u201355 kDa or 55\u201395 kDa and higher than 95 kDa, respectively. The proteins were digested with trypsin and analyzed by LC-MS/MS. A decoy database strategy (Elias and Gygi, 2007) was used which, after applying the appropriate filters, resulted in 89 protein hits: 54 CIV proteins, 34 contaminants and 1 decoy hit giving a False Discovery Rate of 1.1%. Out of the 54 CIV proteins, 46 of the more abundant proteins were identified with 2 or more peptides (Table 1\n), while relatively small proteins like ORFs 342R, 227L or 104L as well as some less abundant proteins could be identified with one peptide only (Table 2\n). The proteins with one hit were manually verified to correlate well to the theoretical b+y ion spectrum and to be unique for one protein only (see also Supplementary Material S1).",

These proteins form a complex which contains a \u201cfinger\u201d protein, a \u201czip\u201d protein, a pentameric complex and an anchor protein. The molecular mass estimations for the finger and zip proteins, the anchor protein and the monomer of the pentameric complex were estimated to be 19.7, 11.9, 32.4 and 39.3 kDa, respectively. For the finger protein the standard deviation was 1.5 kDa, giving a size range of 18.2\u201321.2 kDa (Yan et al., 2009). Based on this range, seven candidate genes for the finger protein were found in the CIV proteome: ORFs 234R, 111R, 096L, 374L, 325L, 203L, and 084L from large to small (Table 1). The zip protein with an expected size range of 10.5 to 13.3 kDa (1.4 kDa standard deviation) may correspond to three candidate ORFs represented in the proteome: 010R, 138R and 321R. The monomer of the pentameric complex estimated at 39.3 kDa corresponds most closely in size to ORFs 329R and 219L. Anchor protein candidate genes in the CIV proteome could be 457L or 142R, with sizes close to 32.4 kDa (Table 1).",

It is possible that one of these additional proteins is involved in chaperoning the viral DNA into the nucleus to initiate DNA replication (Willis and Granoff, 1985). To get a better clue about their importance, the conservation of the CIV virion protein genes in the complete genomes of members of the family Iridoviridae as well as Ascoviridae was assessed.

            "text": "In-gel protein digestions were performed using sequencing grade modified porcine trypsin (Promega, Madison, WI) in ABC buffer at 37 \u00b0C for 15 h, after which the digests were centrifuged at 6000 g. The supernatants were collected, and the remaining gel pieces were extracted with 5% triflouroacetic acid (TFA) and then with 15% ACN /1% TFA. The extracts were combined with the supernatants of the original digests, vacuum-dried, and the dried material was dissolved in 20 \u03bcl 0.1% formic acid in water. The peptides resulting from this digestion were analyzed by LC-MS/MS. To this aim, 18 \u03bcl of the samples were concentrated over a 0.10 \u00d7 32 mm Prontosil 300-5-C18H (Bischoff, Germany) pre-concentration column at a flow of 6 \u03bcl/min for 5 min. Peptides were eluted from the pre-concentration column and loaded onto a 0.10 \u00d7 200 mm Prontosil 300-3-C18H analytical column with a gradient of 10% to 35% ACN in 0.1% formic acid at a flow of 0.5 \u03bcl/min for 50 min. After that the percentage of ACN was increased to 80% (with 0.1% formic acid) in 3 min as a column cleaning step. Between the pre-concentration and analytical column, an electrospray potential of 3.5 kV was applied directly to the eluent via a solid 0.5 mm platina electrode fitted into a P875 Upchurch microT. Full scan positive mode Fourier transform mass spectra (FTMS) were measured between mass-to-charge ratios of 380 and 1400 with a LTQ-Orbitrap spectrometer (Thermo electron, San Jose, CA, USA). MS/MS scans of the four most abundant doubly and triply charged peaks in the FTMS scan were recorded in a data dependent mode in the linear trap (MS/MS threshold = 10.000). All MS/MS spectra obtained with each run were analyzed with Biowork 3.1.1 software (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc.). A maximum of 1 allowed differential modification per peptide was set for oxidation of methionines and de-amidation of asparagine and glutamine residues. Carboxamidomethylation of cysteines was set as a fixed modification. Trypsin specificity was set to fully enzymatic and a maximum of 3 missed cleavages with monoisotopic precursor and fragment ions. The mass tolerance for peptide precursor ions was set to 10 parts per million (10 ppm = 0.01 op m/z 1000 amu) and for MS/MS fragment ions to 0.5 Da. An Invertebrate iridescent virus 6 protein database was used for the analysis (AF303741; created July 31, 2001; downloaded from www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez) after adding a list of commonly observed contaminants like: BSA (P02769, bovine serum albumin precursor), trypsin (P00760, bovine), trypsin (P00761, porcin), keratin K22E (P35908, human), keratin K1C9 (P35527, human), keratin K2C1 (P04264, human) and keratin K1CI (P35527, human). A decoy database was created by adding the reversed sequences using the program SequenceReverser from the MaxQuant package (Cox and Mann, 2008), resulting in a total of 1058 proteins in the database. To identify the proteins in the CIV virions, the MS/MS spectra obtained from the LC-MS/MS were searched against the CIV ORF database using Bioworks 3.3.1 (Table 1). The peptide identifications obtained were filtered in Bioworks with the following filter criteria: \u0394Cn > 0.08, Xcorr > 1.5 for charge state 2+, Xcorr > 3.3 for charge state 3+ and Xcorr > 3.5 for charge state 4+ (Peng et al., 2003). Only those proteins that showed a Bioworks Score factor (Sf) larger then 0.6 were considered.",
