Red CSF indicates hemorrhage; typically this is iatrogenic due to penetration of radicular or meningeal blood vessels. Confirmation of a traumatic tap can be determined via centrifugation, which clears iatrogenic hemorrhage. If red or yellow color persists, this typically indicates chronic hemorrhage. Yellow or straw\u2010tinged CSF is referred to as xanthochromic, and it suggests prior subarachnoid hemorrhage (in the absence of hyperbilirubinemia). Xanthochromia is caused by an accumulation of blood pigments such as hemoglobin, and it may occur within several hours of an acute hemorrhagic insult (trauma, bleeding disorders and occasionally severe CNS inflammation).",

Both imaging modalities typically require general anesthesia, so the decision to perform MRI or CT scan is made on a case\u2010by\u2010case basis. MRI is the gold\u2010standard imaging modality for intracranial disease, as it provides excellent soft\u2010tissue resolution, at times strongly reflective of the gross histopathology associated with specific encephalopathy. Although there are overlapping imaging features among intracranial disorders, MRI often directs the presumptive antemortem diagnosis. The major drawback of MRI, particularly in the critical patient, is that it is a slow imaging modality, especially with low field strength magnets. Conversely, CT scan is a quick imaging tool and may be particularly useful in the acute neurologic patient (eg, head trauma). Despite the limited soft tissue detail provided by CT scan, when coupled with CSF analysis, it may help to provide evidence of ME. The imaging features for several inflammatory brain diseases have been described\n4\n, \n5\n; however, the CT appearance of ME is variable and nonspecific. The presence or absence of contrast enhancement with inflammatory brain disease depends upon the degree of BBB breakdown.\n5\n, \n6\n Despite the fact that it cannot definitively differentiate among disease processes, CT scan may be especially useful for localizing lesions before brain biopsy. An important limitation of CT scan is that it produces a beam hardening artifact (due to preferential absorption of low energy x\u2010ray beams), most notably adjacent to the petrous parts of the temporal bones. This artifact may obscure the clinician's ability to interpret brainstem and cerebellar lesions.",

Typical antibody titers evaluated in canine and feline CNS diseases include: Toxoplasma gondii, Neospora caninum, Ehrlichia spp., Anaplasma spp., Rickettsia rickettsii, and Coccidiodes immitis. Antigen testing, when available (eg, Cryptococcus antigen testing), may circumvent problems associated with the interpretation of antibody testing. Antigen testing, however, may be insensitive because it requires the presence of the organisms in the biological sample under evaluation. In the acute neurologic patient, the authors recommend evaluating antibody titers for regional infectious diseases and also for pathogens to which animals may have been exposed during travel (Figure 2). Although antibody titers reflect direct exposure to the organism, a positive titer does not confirm active infection; titers must be evaluated in the context of the patient's signalment, history, clinical signs, and neuro\u2010imaging results. The clinician should recall that IgM and IgG antibodies reflect acute and chronic infections, respectively. As such, a mildly elevated IgM titer in an acute neurologic patient (with no previous neurologic or systemic disease) may support an infectious etiology, whereas elevated IgG titers may be indicative of previous exposure to a pathogen or vaccination, rather than active disease.",

It is equally important to run positive controls and to perform housekeeping PCR on a canine or feline gene from the case in question.

To perform PCR, DNA must first be extracted from a biological sample (eg, CSF) along with the DNA of the patient.

Initially, the mixture is heated to a high temperature to separate the DNA double helix into individual strands. Next, the temperature is lowered to promote the annealing of the PCR primers to the target DNA, and then raised slightly, to promote the addition of nucleotides to a growing strand of DNA (a so\u2010called amplicon). This process is repeated 25\u201345 times, exponentially amplifying the DNA sequence of interest.

MEM may be focal, multifocal, or disseminated and clinical signs typically are asymmetric in nature. Clinical signs of encephalitis reflect the location of the lesion(s) within the prosencephalon (cerebral hemispheres and thalamus), brainstem, or cerebellum (Table 2). Clinical signs of myelitis reflect whether the spinal cord lesion(s) are within the upper motor neuron or lower motor neuron system, or both. Pain or hyperesthesia, or both, are common with meningitis (brain or spinal cord). Because of the typical acute and progressive nature of MEM, dogs and cats commonly are presented on an emergency basis.",

Infectious differentials for MEM should be pursued vigorously to help differentiate infectious MEM from autoimmune and neoplastic disorders. Pathogens that may cause canine or feline MEM include bacteria, viruses, protozoa, fungi, and rarely rickettsia and parasites (Table 4). Infectious MEM occurs most commonly in young or immunocompromised animals; however, any dog or cat may develop MEM. Some infectious agents are capable of affecting multiple organ systems in addition to the CNS, which may prove helpful in distinguishing CNS infections from autoimmune/idiopathic meningoencephalitides (Figure 3). The severity of CNS infection is dependent on several factors including: the status of the animal's immune system at the time of inoculation, strength of the animal's immune response during active infection, nutritional status of the animal, strain and virulence factors of the infectious agent, and environmental factors. Here we review the most common infectious CNS diseases in the dog and cat and the conventional and novel molecular diagnostic tests used to detect them in CSF and other tissues.",
