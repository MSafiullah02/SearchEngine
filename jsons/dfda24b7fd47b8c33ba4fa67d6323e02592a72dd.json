Neuro-ophthalmology faces unique challenges, given our dependence on aspects of the physical examination and on immediate diagnostic testing. Impaired access impedes our ability to differentiate benign conditions from vision-and life-threatening neurological emergencies. Detailed history and some examination components, such as visual acuity and pupillary examination, are feasible; however, visual field testing and ophthalmoscopy, are difficult or impossible to perform remotely. Decisions regarding diagnostic testing and therapeutic interventions must weigh urgency versus COVID-19 exposure risk. We review changes precipitated by COVID-19, emphasizing those with the potential to outlast the immediate pandemic.",

At the Singapore National Eye Centre (SNEC), plans are underway for video consultation clinics for several subspecialties, including neuro-ophthalmology. Remotely capturing the neuro-ophthalmologic examination has been a major challenge. In the US, a Neuro-Ophthalmology in COVID, 3 multi-institutional physician working group meets weekly to discuss examination techniques and digital applications. Visual acuity can be tested with a printable near card or EyeHandbook application and afferent pupillary defect (APD) testing can be successful with a patientperformed swinging flashlight test. Ocular motor range and detection of nystagmus can also be easily assessed virtually. Telemedicine has many challenges and several benefits, including protection of patients, physicians, and the general public from virus exposure 3, 4 as well as patient and physician convenience. 2 Notably, variable access to technology has the potential to worsen health disparities. Despite this concern, we anticipate virtual visits will be integral to future practice, including for assessment of evaluation urgency.",
