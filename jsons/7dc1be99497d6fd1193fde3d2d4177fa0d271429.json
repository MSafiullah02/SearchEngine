The punishments meted out included naming and shaming App operators, and suspending or terminating the App operators\" services in more severe cases. Regulators have also highlighted that, besides complying with the CSL and other relevant laws, App operators should also abide by the principles of legality, propriety and necessity, and should not collect personal information that is unrelated to the services provided.",

The timeframe of notification should also be carefully defined to allow time for companies to assess the situation and make meaningful notifications. The five business day timeframe suggested in the Paper appears to be more generous than the 72-hour deadline in the GDPR. However, the GDPR\"s stricter deadline is mitigated by allowing notifications to be done in phases (as long as this is done without undue further delay) and permitting a delayed notification where a reasoned justification can be given.",

In the review of the PDPO in 2009, the PCPD pushed for the introduction of new powers in the PCPD to include criminal investigations and prosecution powers.",

Even though several factors may have contributed to this success, the minimized isolation/quarantine measures focused on confirmed patients and the transparent disclosure of relevant information have been pointed out as key factors. The strategy behind this approach was to minimize the risk of infection by separating most of the population from minimized risk factors, and this effort seems to have been largely successful. However, since many of these measures were implemented by the Korean government for the first time, their implementation has led to various criticisms and controversies related to privacy infringement. Through a process of trial and error, efforts have been made to achieve a balance between the privacy of individuals and the public interest, and such efforts are still ongoing. Accordingly, we will take a look at the main issues related to the COVID-19 outbreak in Korea from the perspective of data privacy.",

It was last amended in 2012, with the most notable change being the introduction of direct marketing regulations that came into force in April 2013. While data protection regimes around the world have evolved in recent years to meet the demands of the digital age, the PDPO has not been amended since 2012. Once considered pioneering, the PDPO is now at risk of falling behind and being out of step with international developments.",
