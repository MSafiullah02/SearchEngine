Current studies on TGEV internalization mainly focus on viral receptors, but the internalization mechanism is still unclear. In this study, we used single-virus tracking to obtain the detailed insights into the dynamic events of the TGEV internalization and depict the whole sequential process. We observed that TGEVs could be internalized through clathrin-and caveolae-mediated endocytosis, and the internalization of TGEVs was almost completed within ~2 minutes after TGEVs attached to the cell membrane. Furthermore, the interactions of TGEVs with actin and dynamin 2 in real time during the TGEV internalization were visualized. To our knowledge, this is the first report that single-virus tracking technique is used to visualize the entire dynamic process of the TGEV internalization: before the TGEV internalization, with the assistance of actin, clathrin, and caveolin 1 would gather around the virus to form the vesicle containing the TGEV, and after ~60 seconds, dynamin 2 would be recruited to promote membrane fission.",

            "text": "Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) is an alphacoronavirus and the causative agent of transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE). 1 TGEV is an enveloped virus with a nonsegmented positive-stranded RNA genome that encodes four structural proteins: spike (S) glycoprotein, membrane (M) glycoprotein, envelope (E) protein, and nucleocapsid (N) protein. 2 TGEVs cause severe vomiting, diarrhea, and rapid dehydration in sucking piglets, resulting in severe economic losses in the swine industry. 1 In order to prevent and treat TGE, it is necessary to study the internalization mechanism of TGEVs. The swine testis (ST) cell line, which is highly susceptible to TGEV infection, provides a useful model to study the internalization mechanism of TGEVs. 3 At present, it has been known that porcine aminopeptidase N (pAPN), also known as CD13, is a primary receptor of TGEV that can be used by virus for binding and internalizing into host cells, 3 and the TGEV S glycoprotein plays a crucial role in the early steps of infection. 4 Importantly, it has proved that TGEVs directly interact with pAPN on the cell membrane to form complex that promotes the TGEV internalization by receptor-mediated endocytosis. 5 It is reported that clathrin-and caveolae-mediated endocytosis are both involved in the TGEV internalization. 6 And studies have demonstrated that actin can gather around the cell membrane when TGEVs infect host cells and the disruption of actin can inhibit the TGEV internalization. 7 In addition, depletion of cholesterol, which is present on viral envelope or cell membrane, can result in a reduction of the TGEV internalization. 8 Furthermore, transferrin receptor 1 is a supplementary receptor that assists the TGEV infection and replication. 9 Moreover, epidermal growth factor receptor plays a synergistic role with pAPN to promote the TGEV internalization. 6 Before the broad application of single-virus tracking technique, previous studies on virus internalization, which relied on fixed cell assays, could only provide entire information about the average state of the whole population of viruses and reflect discontinuous moments in the highly dynamic process of virus internalization. 10 With the development of single-virus tracking technique, it is feasible to reveal the transient but indispensable events during virus internalization and display a continuous and precise image of the interaction between virus and cellular components. In addition, the detailed kinetic information over the entire process could also be obtained from single-virus tracking analysis. 11, 12 This approach has already been used to reveal the internalization mechanism of many viruses such as influenza A virus, vesicular stomatitis virus, and human immunodeficiency virus. [13] [14] [15] Therefore, single-virus tracking provides previously unavailable information about the dynamics of endocytic processes and is particularly well suited to address how viruses are targeted to endocytic mechanism.",

All graphs show mean \u00b1 SD as the control. Finally, the cells were fixed and the infected TGEVs were stained with anti-TGEV polyclonal antibody and FITC-conjugated anti-mouse IgG for observation. According to Figure 2A , less infected TGEVs were observed in the CPZ treated ST cells compared to the control ST cells, revealing that CPZ significantly but not completely inhibited the TGEV internalization into ST cells. In order to quantify the CPZ effect on TGEV infection, ST cells were treated with different CPZ concentrations of 1, 5, 10, 50 \u00b5M, and infected with the same amount of TGEVs. The relative TGEV levels were measured by qPCR in Figure 2B , indicating that higher CPZ concentration significantly reduced the TGEV infectivity. Moreover, pitstop 2, which is a selective inhibitor of clathrin-mediated endocytosis that acts via blocking ligand access to the clathrin terminal domain, 21 significantly inhibited the TGEV internalization ( Figure S1A ). Transferrin uptake assays indicated that CPZ and pitstop 2 successfully inhibited the clathrin-mediated endocytosis ( Figure S1B ). In addition, the co-localization experiments showed that the TGEV particles were markedly co-localized with clathrin ( Figure S1E ,F), suggesting that clathrin-mediated endocytosis is important for TGEV internalization. The above results further confirm that TGEVs can be internalized into the host cells via clathrin-mediated endocytosis.",

            "text": "To further investigate the dynamic TGEV internalization via clathrin-mediated endocytosis, single-virus tracking was adopted using the fluorescence confocal microscope (Nikon A1, Tokyo, Japan). The TGEVs were labeled with DiD, and a fusion protein of clathrin light chain B and enhanced green fluorescent protein (Clc-EGFP) was expressed in the ST cells to observe the clathrin-coated structures (CCSs), which were generated by recruiting clathrin from cytoplasm on the cell membrane. Figure 2C depicts the typical dynamic motions of three individual TGEVs internalizing into the ST cells. All these time-lapse images show that the TGEVs first moved slowly in local regions; afterward, they significantly accelerated and moved rapidly through large distances. Moreover, there was no clathrin around the TGEVs in the beginning, then the clathrin gradually appeared with the TGEVs, and finally the clathrin around the TGEVs disappeared. Furthermore, we define entry as the time point at which the particle velocity of TGEV begins to increase, that is, the virus leaves the cell membrane and enters the cell. Analyzed from 38 TGEVs entries via clathrin-mediated endocytosis, the statistical results show that the time duration from the beginning of recruitment of Clc to TGEV entry is 86.42 \u00b1 17.30 seconds. Meanwhile, according to Figures 2C  and S2A , the TGEV internalization via clathrin-mediated endocytosis could be completed within 2 minutes of warm-up. In order to analyze these dynamic motions in details, both the TGEV velocities and the clathrin fluorescence intensities were extracted as shown in Figure 2D . The TGEVs moved slowly with the velocities of 0.076/0.079/0.108 \u03bcm/s, and their velocities rapidly increased to 0.907/0.952/0.912 \u03bcm/s. In addition, the clathrin fluorescence signals gradually increased and then nearly plateaued when the TGEV velocities were low, indicating the generation and the gradual maturation of the clathrin-coated pits (CCPs). The subsequent drastic decline and the eventual disappearance of the clathrin fluorescence signals occurred with the TGEV acceleration, demonstrating that the TGEVs were successfully encapsulated into clathrin-coated vesicles (CCVs) and internalized into the ST cells, followed by the rapid uncoating of the CCVs only within a few seconds. By analyzing the TGEV velocities and the clathrin fluorescence signals, the TGEV motions can be separated into two stages as shown in Figure 2E . Additionally, the TGEV motions were also studied using mean square displacement (MSD). It is found that the TGEVs first experienced anomalous diffusion during the assembly of CCPs on the cell membrane ( Figure 2F) ; and then the rapid motions of TGEVs were in directed diffusion ( Figure  2G ), suggesting that the TGEVs were successfully internalized into the ST cells. Both the results in Figure 2E -G illustrate that the TGEVs first recruited clathrin to form vesicles-containing viruses and then entered into the ST cells.",

            "text": "To reveal the dynamics of TGEV internalization via caveolae-mediated endocytosis, we transfected ST cells with a vector that expressed Cav1 and EGFP fusion protein (Cav1-EGFP) as well as labeled DiD on the TGEVs, and simultaneously tracked the Cav1-EGFP and the DiD signals in the live ST cells. Figure 3C depicts the typical dynamics of three TGEVs internalizing into the ST cells. Furthermore, results of 17 TGEV entries via caveolae-mediated endocytosis show that the average duration from the beginning of recruitment of Cav1 to TGEV entry is 88.56 \u00b1 19.31 seconds, and according to Figures 3C and S2B , the TGEV internalization via caveolae-mediated endocytosis could be finished within 2 minutes of warm-up. Figure 3D shows the TGEV velocities and the caveolae fluorescence signals extracted from Figure 3C . Similar to the case of TGEV internalization via clathrin-mediated endocytosis, the TGEV velocities were rather low as 0.078/0.065/0.079 \u03bcm/s at first but significantly accelerated to 0.937/0.932/0.913 \u03bcm/s after 96/75/111 seconds. Moreover, according to the fluorescence signals, caveolae gradually increased and then maintained stable in the low TGEV velocity stage, but finally disappeared after the TGEVs reached fast velocities. Therefore, the TGEV internalization via caveolae-mediated endocytosis can also be separated into two stages shown in Figure 3E as the trajectories and Figure 3F ,G as the MSD. In the first stage, the TGEVs were attached to the cell membrane with rather low speed in anomalous motion mode accompanied with the generation and the gradual maturation of caveolae; while in the second stage, these TGEVs successfully entered into the ST cells with accelerated velocities in directed motion mode but with the disappearance of caveolae.",

Actin was proved as an essential element of endocytosis. 25 Moreover, it is reported that TGEV infection can stimulate actin gather around the cell membrane, 7 but it is still unclear whether the accumulation of actin is directly involved in the TGEV internalization. To further confirm the actin function, CytoD as an actin monomer-sequestering inhibitor was used in IFA. 26 ST cells were treated with 1 \u03bcM CytoD and then infected with TGEVs. Untreated ST cells infected with the same amount of TGEVs were used as control. Finally, the ST cells were fixed and the infected TGEVs were stained with anti-TGEV polyclonal antibody and FITC-conjugated antimouse IgG for observation. As shown in Figure 5A , the ST cells treated with CytoD exhibited significantly lower TGEV infection levels compared to the control group. Moreover, qPCR was also adopted to study the effects of different CytoD concentrations as 0.1, 0.5, 1, 5 \u03bcM on virus infection: with the increase of CytoD concentrations, the relative TGEV levels decreased as shown in Figure 5B . Both results in Figure 5A ,B further prove that actin is involved in the TGEV internalization. Single-virus tracking was also implemented to investigate the dynamic TGEV-actin interactions by tracking individual DiD-labeled TGEVs internalizing into the ST cells expressing actin-EGFP as shown in Figure 5C . Additionally, Figure 5D shows the TGEV velocities and the actin fluorescence signals extracted from Figure 5C . Actin around the TGEVs gradually increased and maintained with rather high levels when the TGEVs performed rather low velocities as 0.067/0.105/0.099 \u03bcm/s; after 114/81/63 seconds, actin around the TGEVs rapidly decreased as TGEVs accelerated to 0.913/0.931/0.956 \u03bcm/s, both synchronizing with the TGEV internalization via clathrin-and caveolae-mediated endocytosis. Therefore, it is speculated that actin could assist clathrin and caveolae endocytic pathways to promote the TGEV internalization. Similar to the conditions of TGEV internalization via clathrin-and caveolae-mediated endocytosis, the TGEV motions could also be divided into two stages shown in Figure 5E as the trajectories and Figure 5F and G as the MSD. The first stage describes the attached TGEVs recruited actin with low velocities in anomalous diffusion mode; and the second stage shows the TGEVs successfully entered into the ST cells with high velocities in directed diffusion mode.",

Compared to the TGEV internalization via actin assistance, it is proved that Dyn2 can assist clathrin or caveolae endocytic pathways to promote the TGEV internalization in its late stage. evolved sophisticated mechanisms to hijack host cell machinery for initiating productive infections. Merely in internalization, viruses make use of a repertoire of cellular processes that involve hundreds of cellular proteins. 30 In this work, we investigated the TGEV internalization in real time using single-virus tracking, which could observe and analyze the mechanistic and kinetic events during TGEV internalization. Based on electron microscope, previous study suggested that the TGEVs entered the host cells by endocytosis. Unfortunately, it is still unknown whether the TGEV endocytosis relies on clathrin dependent or independent pathway; however, the observed thickening of the membrane below some attached TGEVs in many cases indicated the involvement of the clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Using single-virus tracking, we observed that the TGEVs entered the ST cells via clathrin-and caveolae-mediated endocytosis, and the entire TGEV internalization could be completed within ~2 minutes as shown in Figure 7B and S2. In addition, the endocytic pathway inhibitors CPZ, pitstop 2, nystatin, and M\u03b2CD significantly reduced TGEV internalization, further illustrating that the TGEVs could enter the ST cells via clathrin-and caveolae-mediated endocytosis. According to the previous study, it was reported that the TGEV internalization reduced in the porcine intestinal columnar epithelial cells treated with shR-NAs that targeting clathrin or caveolin; and the TGEVs could be clearly co-localized with endocytic transferrin and cholera toxin beta subunit. 6 Therefore, our conclusion obtained from single-virus tracking that the TGEVs utilized clathrin-and caveolae-mediated endocytosis for the internalization is in agreement with the previous studies.",

By using specific inhibitors, RNA interference, and dominant negative mutants, it has been indicated that hepatitis C virus, African swine fever virus, hepatitis E virus, and porcine hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus enter their host cells via clathrin-mediated endocytosis, [31] [32] [33] [34] while grass carp reovirus and porcine sapelovirus enter their host cells via caveolae-mediated endocytosis. 35, 36 In addition to these conventional methods, single-virus tracking provides many new insights into the study of the virus endocytic mechanism. Using this method, it has been successfully revealed the dynamic process of internalization of many viruses as influenza virus, dengue virus, vesicular stomatitis virus, and infectious hematopoietic necrosis virus. 13, 14, 18, 37, 38 By comparing our data with those obtained on other viruses mentioned above, we found that the dynamic of TGEV internalization is consistent with these viruses. These viruses first move slowly in local regions; afterward, they significantly accelerate and move rapidly through large distances. In addition, the internalizations of these viruses all experience two diffusion modes, first anomalous diffusion mode and then directed diffusion mode.",
