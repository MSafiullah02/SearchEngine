[4] proposed CNL, an unsupervised method, to utilize multiple attributes to perform UIL in an incremental manner. Factoid Embedding [21] is the state-of-art unsupervised approach which utilizes multiple user attributes to learn a user embeddings for UIL. The method first constructs factoids from user attributes and learns user identity latent representation by embedding the factoids. However, the user embedding is learned based on only local information of OSNs. Cross platforms features have been ignored. The UIL results, therefore, could be poor if the local user attribute information is noisy. Our proposed framework addresses this limitation by introducing user-discriminative features. In this paper, we will demonstrate how Factoid Embeddings can be used as input base embeddings so as to achieve improved UIL results.",

Our proposed framework incorporates two key ideas, user-discriminative features and retrofitting embeddings. Our framework applies the user-discriminative features to derive pairs of cross-platform similar user identities for retrofitting the base user embeddings. Through extensive experiments on three real-world OSN datasets, we show that our proposed framework can leverage user-discriminative features to effectively improve the accuracy of different base user embeddings. For future work, we will conduct a more in-depth study on the parameters used in our framework, and will design methods to optimize them automatically.",
