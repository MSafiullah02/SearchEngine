Pig diarrhea especially post-weaning diarrhea remains one of the most important swine diseases. ETEC bacterial fimbriae including K88, F18, 987P, K99 and F41 promote bacterial attachment to intestinal epithelial cells and facilitate ETEC colonization in pig small intestine. ETEC enterotoxins including heat-labile toxin (LT) and heat-stable toxins type Ia (porcine-type STa) and type II (STb) stimulate fluid hyper-secretion, leading to watery diarrhea. Blocking bacteria colonization and/or neutralizing enterotoxicity of ETEC toxins are considered effective prevention against ETEC diarrhea. In this study, we applied the MEFA (multiepitope fusion antigen) strategy to create toxoid MEFAs that carried antigenic elements of ETEC toxins, and examined for broad antitoxin immunogenicity in a murine model. By embedding STa toxoid STa P12F (NTFYCCELCCNFACAGCY), a STb epitope (KKDLCEHY), and an epitope of Stx2e A subunit (QSYVSSLN) into the A1 peptide of a monomeric LT toxoid (LT R192G ), two toxoid MEFAs, 'LT R192G -STb-Stx2e-STa P12F ' and 'LT R192G -STb-Stx2e-3xSTa P12F ' which carried three copies of STa P12F , were constructed. Mice intraperitoneally immunized with each toxoid MEFA developed IgG antibodies to all four toxins. Induced antibodies showed in vitro neutralizing activities against LT, STa, STb and Stx2e toxins. Moreover, suckling piglets born by a gilt immunized with 'LT R192G -STb-Stx2e-3xSTa P12F ' were protected when challenged with ETEC strains, whereas piglets born by a control gilt developed diarrhea. Results from this study showed that the toxoid MEFA induced broadly antitoxin antibodies, and suggested potential application of the toxoid MEFA for developing a broad-spectrum vaccine against ETEC diarrhea in pigs.", "cite_spans": [], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}], "body_text": [{"text": "Young piglets commonly develop diarrhea, clinical conditions known as neonatal diarrhea and post-weaning diarrhea.

While neonatal diarrhea can be effectively prevented by passive protection of maternal antibodies, through immunization of pregnant sows; there are no effective prevention strategies against post-weaning diarrhea in weaned pigs. Vaccination is considered the most practical and likely the most effective approach to prevent pig diarrhea.

Fimbrial adhesins mediate ETEC bacterial attachment to specific receptors at pig intestinal epithelial cells and facilitate colonization in the pig small intestine (Smith and Linggood, 1971) , playing an essential role in initiating the disease. But it is the enterotoxins that disrupt fluid homeostasis in pig small intestinal epithelial cells to cause fluid and electrolyte hyper-secretion, leading to diarrhea (Nataro and Kaper, 1998) .

This chimeric gene can be modified to express a LT-like holotoxin-structured toxoid MEFA protein. As we demonstrated previously (Ruan and Zhang, 2013) , by simply inserting back the nucleotides coding the native leading signal peptides of the LT A subunit gene (eltA) and the LT B subunit gene (eltB), and also the cistron gene structure between the two LT subunit genes, a monomeric LT gene can be reversed to a LT-like gene coding a LT-like holotoxin-structured protein. Since the native LT B gene expresses the LT B subunit and forms LT B pentamer independently, a modified 'LT R192G -STb-Stx2e-STa P12F ' fusion protein can form LT B pentamer and binds to GM1 receptors in pig small intestine. If expressed by a nonpathogenic E. coli strain, the modified LT-like-structured 'LT R192G -STb-Stx2e-STa P12F ' toxoid MEFA could be used to develop a live oral vaccine against porcine ETEC diarrhea. Even for the 'LT R192G -STb-Stx2e-3xSTa P12F ' toxoid MEFA, if all three copies of STa P12F or a different STa toxoid are embedded at the LT A1 peptide, for an example, at the N-and Cterminus of the A1 peptide, the monomeric 'LT R192G -STb-Stx2e-3xSTa P12F ' can also be converted to a holotoxin-structured protein and expressed by an E. coli or a Salmonella strain for a live ETEC vaccine candidate.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 567, "end": 573, "text": "Fig. 6", "ref_id": null}, {"start": 1551, "end": 1573, "text": "(Ruan and Zhang, 2013)", "ref_id": "BIBREF29"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Discussion"}, {"text": "Double mutant LT, dmLT (LT R192G/L211A ) was used as adjuvant for pig immunization.

In this study, we adopted the Vero cell cytotoxicity assay to assess antibody neutralization activities against STb and Stx2e. Future studies to use purified STb or Stx2e toxin instead of bacterial culture filtrates or to adopt a Shiga toxin quantitative microtiter assay (Gentry and Dalrymple, 1980 ) may measure better anti-Stx2e or anti-STb antibody neutralization activity. In addition, immunizing neonatal piglets and challenging weaned piglets with the LT+, STb+, and STa + ETEC strains separately will be needed to assess protective efficacy against each toxin, post-weaning diarrhea, and also perhaps Stx2e associated edema disease as described by Oanh et al.
