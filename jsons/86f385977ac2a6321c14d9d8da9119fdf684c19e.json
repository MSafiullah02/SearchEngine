            "text": "Induction of robust and long-lasting cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTL) responses by a vaccine is an open and difficult challenge. In particular, protective immunity to viral infections is mediated by neutralizing antibodies and by CD8 1 CTLs. Both responses depend on antigen-specific CD4 1 T helper lymphocytes. It was originally proposed that peptides recognized by CD8 1 CTLs result from the processing of endogenous intracellular proteins and that peptides recognized by CD4 1 T helper cells derive from exogenous antigens. More recently, it has been shown that peptides derived from exogenous antigens can also be provided to major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules for presentation to CD8 1 CTLs. This 'cross-presentation' process involves both dendritic cells and macrophages such as antigen-presenting cells, priming a wide variety of CD8 1 T cell responses to different exogenous antigens (Ramirez & Sigal, 2002 Shen et al., 2004) . We have developed an antigen delivery system based on filamentous bacteriophage virions engineered to display foreign epitopes. Fd phages (di Marzo Veronese et al., 1994; Veronese et al., 1994; Malik & Perham, 1996 , 1997 Malik et al., 1996a) can display multiple copies of exogenous peptides inserted in the exposed N-terminal region of the 2700 copies of the major coat protein, pVIII, that form the capsid of virion. We have demonstrated that fd phages could be processed both by MHC class I and class II pathways to induce CTL and T helper responses (Gaubin et al., 2003) . In fact, double hybrid virions were used simultaneously displaying a CTL and a T helper epitope of the HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RTAse) to prime specific CTL from human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) and to perform in vivo immunization of HLA-A2 transgenic mice (De Berardinis et al., 1999 , 2000 .",

The immunogenicity of the mix of two single hybrid phages, one carrying the CTL epitope and the other the T helper epitope, was compared with the double hybrid phage, displaying both epitopes on the surface of the same virion. The two different phage combinations were tested in C57BL6/J mice using either CFA/IFA or polyI:C as adjuvant. We found that the efficiency of the two antigen formulations on CTL activation is different. It is noteworthy that the single hybrid phage displaying CTL epitope is able to induce an efficient and long-lasting response even in the absence of the T helper exogenous epitope.",

Two weeks after the second antigen administration, mice were sacrificed and the splenocytes tested for anti-OVA 257-264 peptide-specific CTL and IFN-g responses. Figure 1 shows representative examples for each of the four groups (1-4). The panels show the percentage of sacrifice at different responder-to-target ratio. Mice were immunized using Freund's adjuvant in (a) and (b) and polyI:C adjuvant in (c) and (d). (a) and (c) show the OVA 257-264 specific CTL responses and (b) and (d) the alloreactivity responses of the same mice, demonstrating the effectiveness of the mouse immune system. Figure 2 summarizes the results obtained with the two groups of mice immunized subcutaneously using the Freund's adjuvants. Group (1) was immunized with the double hybrid phage fdOVA/HBVc and group (2) immunized with a mix of the two single hybrid phages fdOVA and fdHBVc. Panel (a) shows the percentage of specific lysis after subtraction of background lysis of the unpulsed target at the responder/target ratio 270:1. Immunization of mice with either the double hybrid phage or the mix of the two single hybrid phages resulted in a similar OVA-specific CTL activity, but no antigen-specific lysis was detected when mice were injected with wild-type phages. We further evaluated the effector cell populations by determining the frequency of IFN-g producing splenocytes in response to in vitro stimulation with OVA 257-264 peptide. We set up a short-term culture with antigen-presenting cells that had either been pulsed or not with OVA peptide and IFN-g producing cells were measured by ELISPOT after culture for 40 h. The results are shown in panel (b). The number of antigen-specific IFN-g SFC per million cells is shown on the y-axis, and each symbol represents the spots obtained from a single mouse after subtraction of background killing achieved with unpulsed antigen-presenting cells. The mean values of the spots for each group are also indicated. In all mice analyzed, the mix of the two single hybrid phages was consistently better at inducing IFN-g producing cells than the double hybrid phage.

The number of antigenspecific IFN-g SCF per million cells is shown on the y-axis. Each symbol represents the spots obtained from a single mouse after subtraction of background spots with unpulsed APC. The mean value is represented for each group.

            "text": "In the search for new vaccines to replace older, ineffective or toxigenic formulations, peptides that are the target epitope of T and B cells represent attractive candidates. Peptides are usually poor immunogens and induce minimal CD8 1 T cell responses, a shortcoming that may be overcome by coupling them to various carrier molecules. Moreover, vaccine formulations based on soluble exogenous antigens have been shown to be inefficient for class I presentation. To find the best strategy to deliver exogenous antigens into the MHC class I pathway and induce potent MHC class I-restricted CTL responses, a broad panel of soluble and particulate vectors has been engineered (Moron et al., 2004) to take advantage of the capacity of antigen-presenting cell crosspresentation. Filamentous bacteriophage was used as a carrier of foreign peptides because it is an excellent antigen delivery system, a nonpathogenic and nonreplicating vehicle. It is simpler to handle and less expensive than other carriers (Guardiola et al., 2001) . In previous papers we have demonstrated that antigenic peptides displayed on the phage capside are very immunogenic because these particles may be processed by class I and class II pathways (Gaubin et al., 2003) . Other authors have also confirmed the mechanism of cross-presentation of phage particles that are initially degraded in the proteasome. Subsequently, the resulting peptides may be delivered back into the phagosome lumen and loaded onto MHC class I molecules with help from the TAP complex (Wan et al., 2005) . A very peculiar characteristic of bacteriophages is their ability to display multiple copies of exogenous peptides on the capside. The viral assembly allows the incorporation of 10-30% recombinant pVIII in the capside structure during the single or double hybrid phages synthesis, depending on the biochemical characteristics of peptides (di Marzo Veronese et al., 1994) . For this reason the concentration of specific peptides administered with carrier is very low (1-4 mg) and the peptides have to be established by N-terminal sequence for each phage preparation. We used the bacteriophage antigen delivery system to test its ability to induce specific CD8 1 response in wild-type mice. This is the first time that they have been shown to induce a long-term specific cytotoxicity. Both phage formulations, the double hybrid phages fdOVA/HBVc displaying CTL and T helper epitopes on the same capside structure, and the mix of the two single hybrid phages fdOVA and fdHBVc, are able to induce peptide specific cytotoxicity and IFN-g production. Our results were confirmed by antigen-specific tetramer staining. Although both phage formulations displayed 1.4 mg OVA peptide, the mix of single hybrid phages induced a higher CTL activity and IFN-g production, probably because of the greater number of carrier phages used with a possible adjuvant role.",

Long-term antigen-specific cytotoxicity after immunization with recombinant phages plus poly I:C adjuvant. Mice were immunized by two injections of either the mix fdOVA1fdHBVc or fdOVA alone plus polyI:C adjuvant. Two months later, mice were sacrificed and tested for antigen-specific cytotoxicity. The percentages of antigen-specific killing are shown on the y-axis, after subtraction of background killing of unpulsed targets. Responder/target ratios is 270:1. Each symbol represents the lysis obtained from a single mouse. The mean value is represented for each group. The P value was calculated by comparing each group of immunized mice with the group of untreated mice.",
