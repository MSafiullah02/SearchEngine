            "text": "Vaccinia virus (VACV) is the best-studied poxvirus and the prototype live virus vaccine used to eradicate human smallpox (for review see (Moss, 2013a)). VACV was among the first animal viruses to be cultured and purified (Maitland and Maitland, 1928; F. Parker and Nye, 1925; R.F. Parker and Rivers, 1935; Steinhardt et al., 1913). Early studies with virus preparations from the skin of infected rabbits (Smadel et al., 1939) or the chorioallantois membrane (CAM) of embryonated chicken eggs (Dumbell et al., 1957) already provided evidence that more total particles (also called \u201celementary bodies\u201d) are produced than infectious VACV virions. Indeed, a ratio of 10 total particles to 1 plaque-forming unit (PFU) was determined for purified preparations of VACV using a protocol of ultracentrifugation through sucrose-gradient similar to the one still used for producing vaccine preparations (Joklik, 1962). A single study using semi-purified (removal of cellular debris from virus harvest via low-speed centrifugation) MVA and comparing EM counted particles to tissue culture infectious dose 50 (TICD50) determined 2\u20133-fold more total particles than the TICD50 (Guggenberger, 1989). This biological phenomenon is true for many animal viruses, and even when disregarding morphologically or biochemically \u201cincomplete\u201d virions, 10 to 1 million virus particles are usually needed to initiate a single event of infection (Isaacs, 1957).",

Interestingly, early experiments suggested that the greater fraction of the non-plaque-forming VACV particles enter cells and are infectious in tissue culture (Galasso and Sharp, 1964). Yet, it remained obscure whether these infections were able to initiate the virus life cycle, switching on gene expression and protein synthesis. Furthermore, the prevalence of non-plaque-forming particles in VACV vaccine preparations and their possible influence on immunogenicity or vaccine efficacy are largely unknown.",

MVA lost its ability to productively replicate in most mammalian cells, but maintained expression of all classes of viral and recombinant genes under conditions of non-permissive viral growth. Therefore MVA can serve as an exceptionally safe live viral vector vaccine (Sutter and Moss, 1992). Multiple recombinant MVAs are currently undergoing clinical testing for vaccination against various human infections including AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria (for reviews see (Gilbert, 2013; Gomez et al., 2013)). Critically, recent candidate MVA vaccines are being developed for experimental immunization of humans against emerging infections such as highly pathogenic avian influenza virus H5N1, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, West Nile fever, or Ebola hemorrhagic fever (Ewer et al., 2016, Kreijtz et al., 2014, Volz et al., 2015, Volz et al., 2016).",

            "text": "The mechanistic reason(s) for the substantial portion of abortive infection events still remain unclear. One possibility is that VACV preparations commonly contain fractions of \u201cdefective\u201d virions unable to initiate a full cycle of viral gene expression and productive virus replication. We examined the virus particles in our stock preparations by electron microscopy and detected only mature brick-shaped virions with normal morphology (data not shown). Yet, this apparent absence of malformed particles does not formally exclude the possibility of mutations blocking later stages of infections. Alternatively, the biology of the host cell is essential for the replication of VACV and it is tempting to speculate that simply the condition of the infected host cell determines the outcome of an infection. The activation of host cell signaling pathways e.g. involving the MAPKs (mitogen-activated protein kinases) ERK (extracellular signal-regulated kinase) and JNK (Jun N-terminal kinase) has been shown to be critical for productive infection and VACV spread (Andrade et al., 2004, de Magalhaes et al., 2001; F. Wang et al., 2004). Moreover, the activation of these host signaling pathways is specifically modulated in the favor of virus replication by various poxvirus regulatory proteins (de Magalhaes et al., 2001, Schweneker et al., 2012, Torres et al., 2016; G. Wang et al., 2006). These findings are used in the development of oncolytic poxviruses that better grow in tumor cells where such pathways are malignantly activated (Bell and McFadden, 2014). Our observation of CVA-GFP-mCherry infection resulting in enhanced plaque formation in HeLa cells might be based on the preferential productive replication of this virus in tumor cells (see Fig. 3B).",

MVs are infectious virions surrounded by a lipoprotein membrane that accumulate within the cytoplasm of VACV infected cells (Condit et al., 2006). Since MV are the most abundant virion form present in vaccine preparations, the data obtained in our experiments might be essential for the quality control of MVA based vaccines. Both infectious forms, MV and EV, have distinct biological properties and activities: EV are responsible for efficient cell-to-cell spread and contribute to transmission within the host, while the MV play a key role in the transmission between the host animals (Blasco and Moss, 1992, Cudmore et al., 1995, Moss, 2012). Further experiments are needed to clarify on a possibly distinct role of EV infections on gene expression and plaque formation in different host cell substrates.",

Despite the inability of these \u201cdefective\u201d virus particles to induce plaque formation, these particles are still able to switch on early gene expression. Interestingly, already early work by Galasso and Sharp (1964) suggested that \u201cnon-replicating\u201d VACV particles enter cells and exert biological activities. More recently, UV-inactivated recombinant VACV is used to express early genes as nonreplicative vector in tumor immunotherapy (Zajac et al., 2003). Thus, viral and recombinant early transcripts might serve to efficiently trigger innate immune responses and antigen production by recombinant vaccines similar to processes described for other vaccine-induced activations of immunity. In addition, these findings indicate that the choice of early or early-late promoters is an appropriate approach to most practically activate vaccine-induced immunity. Finally, our results further support the ability of MVA-based vaccines to stimulate a balanced interplay between innate and adaptive immunity as the key to robust protection against a selected pathogen.",

After 30 min incubation at 4 \u00b0C (cold start), cells were washed with PBS three times and incubated at 37 \u00b0C with 200 \u00b5l fresh medium containing 2% HI-FBS. 24 h after infection multiple fluorescent and bright-field images of the infected wells were acquired using a 20x objective, and then stitched together via the Keyence Merge function. Afterwards a vaccinia specific immunostaining of the captured wells was performed, as described above (Plaque assay). Bright-field images of these wells served as controls. The total single fluorescent cell count was quantified using single extraction function of the Hybrid Cell Count Software (Keyence Hybrid Cell Count Module, BZ-H3C) and total foci were counted manually.",
