Improving performance on these queries has a large business impact from the long term benefits of greater customer satisfaction [2, 7] .

An example of this is shown in Table 1 where the attributes 'color', 'plating', and 'base material' are all correct labels for the token 'silver' in the query 'silver oxidised earring'. This phenomenon is particularly prevalent in tail queries; an analysis of an editorially labelled sample of tail queries at Flipkart revealed that approximately 42% of tail queries had multiple correct intents. Existing techniques for identifying user intent in search queries are either supervised [17, 19] or semi-supervised [11, 19] and require labelled or partially labelled queries. Extending them to identify multiple intents in tail queries is difficult due to a lack of sufficient click-through data from which labels can be derived [14, 17, 25] . We address this shortcoming of existing techniques in our current work.",

We propose a latent variable generative model for the observed ordered pairs of query tokens that has the corresponding ordered pairs of attribute labels as the latent variables. This addresses the lack of labelled data for tail queries. We observed that tail queries tend to have multiple intents due to multiple attributes having similar high empirical probabilities of generating the same tokens. We propose a similarity measure between attribute pairs and use it to regularize our model in a way that the learnt posterior distributions have similar probabilities for similar attribute pairs. This addresses the problem of identifying multiple intents in tail queries. We finally demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed model against several strong baselines on an editorially labelled data set and in a large scale online A/B experiment at Flipkart where we achieved statistically significant improvements of 3.03% in click-through rate and 15.45% in add-to-cart ratio. Fig. 1 . We define tail queries as queries that occur less than 50 times a month. The attributes that describe the products within a category are denoted by A and the values these attributes can take are denoted by V. Every product can thus be represented by a set of attribute-value pairs (a, v) where v may consist of multiple tokens. For example, some of the values that the attribute 'material' can take in the Jewellery category are 'rose gold', 'silver', 'bronze', 'stainless steel', etc. The vocabulary of tokens that constitute all the attribute values is denoted by W. A query is denoted by x and is defined as a sequence of n tokens (x 1 , x 2 , . . . , x n ). The intent of this query is denoted by z and is defined as a corresponding assignment of n attribute sets (z 1 , z 2 , . . . , z n ), where z i \u2286 A. We let z i be a set so that a query can have multiple intents. In our current work, we focus on intent identification within a category and assume a query to category mapping is available; a fairly standard assumption in vertical search engines [3] .",

            "text": "Constructing Intent Labels from Click Logs: Manual intent labelling of queries is a laborious task requiring significant domain expertise. However, for queries that occur sufficiently often in the click logs, matches between the query tokens and the attribute-values of the clicked products provide a natural means of obtaining the attribute labels. Following [19] , for a particular query we find matches between its tokens and the tokens of the attribute-values of every product that is clicked for this query. We then aggregate these matches across attributes to construct intent labels for every token in the query. This process is applied to queries that occur at least 500 times in a month with a click-through rate of at least 40%. Using such frequent queries with high click-through rates lets us construct reliable and fairly noise-free attribute labels for them. Applying this process to tail queries will result in fairly noisy attribute labels [11, 14, 17] . The labelled data set thus constructed is denoted by D L and is referred to as the click-log labelled data in this paper. The average number of such labelled queries D L for the Jewellery, Furniture, and Home Furnishing categories is \u22485k while the average number of unique queries D that occur at least 10 times a month in these categories is \u224850k. The labelled queries are much fewer than the unique queries which shows the limitations of constructing intent labels from click logs.",

From Fig. 2a , it is noteworthy that the most frequent attribute pattern represents on average only 5% of the unique queries in the three categories.

The authors of [5] propose a simple generative process for queries which generates query tokens independently by first sampling an attribute and then sampling a token from that attribute's vocabulary. However, modelling dependence is important since the attribute label for a token depends on the other tokens in a query. For example, consider the queries 'cotton sofa cushion' and 'cotton bed sheets double bed'. The correct label for 'cotton' in the first query is 'filling material' while in the second query is 'fabric'. This highlights the need for a richer generative model that captures token interactions and attribute co-occurrences in a query.",

We further created 5 randomized 80/20 splits of the golden set to get multiple test and validation sets. We computed marginal distributions at each token position in a query for all models and considered only those labellings that were above a threshold tuned on a validation set. We chose F 1 score as the performance metric and since we are interested in queries with multiple intents, we follow [8] and get the overall F 1 score per query by micro-averaging the F 1 score per query token.

Moreover, RIM and PMM together outperform all baseline models which demonstrates the effectiveness of modelling pairwise dependencies between the query tokens. All the supervised baseline models including Bi-LSTM-CRF, a state-of-the-art model for slot-tagging problems, perform much worse than the unsupervised baseline model UMM due to a lack of sufficient labelled data. RIM's performance improvements over PMM demonstrate the effectiveness of our data dependent attribute similarity regularisation for queries with multiple intents.

            "text": "The intent inferred for a search query plays a major role in determining and retrieving the most relevant products for that query at Flipkart as is standard in e-commerce search [15] . Thus, the quality of the inferred intent very strongly influences a user's propensity to click and add-to-cart the products retrieved for a search query. Hence, we measure the click-through rate (CTR) and the add-tocart ratio as the relevant metrics in the online A/B experiment. The add-to-cart ratio (i.e., search conversion) is defined as the fraction of searches leading to a product being added to the shopping cart. We deployed RIM and UMM in the production search system at Flipkart and compared the performance of the models against each other in a standard A/B experiment configuration where we treated UMM as the control condition. More than 10 million users visit Flipkart daily and we randomly assigned 15% of the users to each condition and conducted the test over 10 days. Since the models were trained for the Jewellery, Home Furnishing, and Furniture categories, only those queries belonging to these categories were considered for comparison. The query to category mapping was obtained by a separate production system at Flipkart. We would have ideally liked to restrict the experiment to tail queries with multiple intents only in order to better demonstrate the capabilities of RIM. However, in practice it is difficult to determine on the fly if a query has multiple intents. Thus, we conducted the experiment on all tail queries. The query volume affected by the experiment was \u224875k tail queries (with \u2248 36k unique queries). The results of this online A/B experiment are summarized in Table 4 . RIM significantly improves both the CTR and the add-to-cart ratio for tail queries across all categories. The average improvement in CTR is 3.03% while that in add-to-cart ratio is 15.45%. The results for all categories were statistically significant as measured by a paired sample t-test with p-value < 0.01. The much larger improvement in add-to-cart ratio as compared to CTR is noteworthy. On further analysis, we found that most tail queries express a very specific product need and when the search system is able to infer the correct query intent and retrieve the relevant products, the customers are satisfied, as indicated by addto-cart, with fewer clicks. We are thus able to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model in a large scale real world setting. We finally illustrate the retrieval quality with intents inferred by RIM compared to the existing production system for two queries in Figs. 4 and 5. Both queries are tail queries drawn from the online A/B experiment and RIM correctly identifies their intents. Fig. 4 . Top retrieved products for the query 'small pillow cover pack' by the existing production system (left) and with intents inferred by RIM (right). The production system retrieves irrelevant bed sheets. RIM correctly identifies 'pillow cover' as 'store/model' and 'small' as 'size/shape'. ",

            "text": "The existing work on query understanding has mainly focused on learning query intent in a supervised manner by using click-through data [6, 9, 12, 22] and this restricts their generalization to combinations of frequent attribute patterns only. However, tail queries exhibit tail attribute patterns and this is the focus of our current work. The existing methods for understanding intent of tail queries can be broadly divided into two major types: (a) Those that identify a mapping between tail queries and similar frequent queries [11, 24] , and (b) Those that learn query intent from partially labelled queries [16, 17, 19] . Fusing the results of a tail query with those of a similar frequent query as a way of improving retrieval metrics is suggested in [11] . However, the underlying assumption that a tail query is a frequent query that is expressed differently does not hold in our case. Transferring the intent of frequent queries to tail queries using an external knowledge base is studied in [24] . However, building domain specific knowledge bases is difficult. Learning query intent from partially labelled queries along with side-supervision in the form of derived attributes for some query tokens is studied in [19] . However, it is difficult to obtain partial labellings for tail queries because most tokens in tail queries will be marked as 'unknown' due to the sparsity of the click-through data as observed in [17] . A hidden-unit linear-chain CRF that allows for non-linearities is introduced in [16] . However, its formulation too requires partially labelled queries. The availability of derived labelled data by performing rule-based labelling of unlabelled sequences is assumed in [4] . However, the rule-based labelling is domain specific and is difficult to extend. The CRF auto-encoder [1] and its application to tasks like POS tagging [20] is promising especially since it does not require labelled data. However, the CRF auto-encoder has difficulty scaling to the label space for query intent understanding that is much larger than that for POS tagging. The most recent work on understanding intent of e-commerce search queries is described in [26] for Google shopping. However, it is not applicable in our setting since it focuses on a different problem of understanding overall query intent and not token level attribute labelling.",
