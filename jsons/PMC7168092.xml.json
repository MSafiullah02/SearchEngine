Such an analysis is especially important for identifying conserved structural elements and catalytically essential residues, in addition to the HExxH\u2026E/H gluzincin motif, which form the complete Ste24 active\u2010site.

In contrast, the active sites of intramembrane ZMPs, such as Site\u20102 Protease, are located within the most hydrophobic portion of the membrane interior.57 Comparison of Ste24 enzymes to homologous, soluble gluzincins indicates that residues essential for catalysis arise from TM \u03b1\u2010helices VI and VII, the L5D (\u03b23\u2010strand and \u03b13\u2010helix), and the CTD (\u03b15\u2010 and \u03b17\u2010helices) (Figure 2B). For the purposes of this study, we refer to this grouping as the \u201cZMP Core\u201d module (Figure 3A). The designation of a \u201cZMP Core\u201d module, shared by Ste24 with soluble ZMPs, is further supported by our recent structure of HsSte24 complexed with the classical ZMP inhibitor phosphoramidon (Figure 3B).35 Phosphoramidon is a competitive inhibitor and transition\u2010state analog of several soluble ZMPs, particularly the gluzincins thermolysin (M4)58 and neprilysin (M13).59 Phosphoramidon also inhibits HsSte24 proteolysis and its binding mode, localized solely within the \u201cZMP Core\u201d module, is highly conserved among these three families (M4, M13, and M48) of ZMPs.35\n",

Based on predicted catalytic (C) or substrate (S) binding roles in the ZMP Core domain, or structural roles of the ZMP Accessory domain, we have identified 17, absolutely conserved Ste24 residues that share conservation with all (or a subset) of the identified gluzincin homologs. None of these positions are located in the \u03b1\u2010barrel module (Figure 4 and Figure S2).

These modules differentiate the Ste24 family from its soluble gluzincin counterparts, as the zinc\u2010centered active\u2010site sits at the membrane interface and requires molecular interactions from the extra\u2010membrane buttress (ie, ZMP Accessory) and membrane\u2010spanning, \u03b1\u2010barrel \u201chat\u201d (ie, \u03b1\u2010barrel module) (Figures 1 and 3).

Ste24 possesses the gluzincin 297HExxH301\u2026E390 consensus sequence motif located at the base of TM helices VI and VII. Residues His297, His301, and Glu390 coordinate the zinc ion, with Glu298 acting as the general base during turnover.37, 40 C, Topology diagram of Ste24. The color\u2010coding of the ribbon diagram in panels A and B is maintained. TM \u03b1\u2010helices are labeled I\u2010VII. Two, large membrane interfacial regions flank the coordinated zinc ion: the mixed \u03b1\u2010helix\u2010\u03b2\u2010sheet Loop 5 Domain (L5D) located between helix V and helix VI, and the \u03b1\u2010helical C\u2010terminal Domain (CTD)",

            "text": "Figure 2: Identification of essential residues for Ste24 protease activity outside the HExxH\u2026E/H gluzincin motif. A, Gluzincin ZMPs homologous to Ste24. The structures are sorted from least similar (top) to most similar (bottom) based on the Dali similarity or Z score between the Ste24 search model and the identified structures. Inspection of output from the Dali server42 revealed thermolysin (PDB 1LNF, Dali Z score 3.6), neprilysin (PDB 1DMT, Dali Z score 4.9), and the ZMP from G sulfurreducens (PDB 3C37, Dali Z score 6.3) as soluble, gluzincin structures most homologous to Ste24. The functional annotations for the selected gluzincins thermolysin (M4), neprilysin (M13), and the G sulfurreducens ZMP (M48) are based on MEROPS38 database assignments. Conserved \u03b1\u2010helical (containing the HExxE\u2026E motif residues shown as sticks) and \u03b2\u2010strand elements are highlighted and represent a canonical gluzincin structure motif. Note the neprilysin and G sulfurreducens ZMP structures carry an extra domain situated above this motif. Closer inspection of each individual core region identifies residues (shown as sticks) essential for optimal substrate cleavage (indicated by C) and specificity for the side chain of the amino acid immediately C\u2010terminal to the scissile bond (indicated by S1\u2032) where the prime (\u2032) designation indicates enzyme specificity sites for amino acid side\u2010chain(s) C\u2010terminal to the scissile bond.65 ZMP residues participating in peptide bond cleavage (ie, catalytic) are absolutely conserved and positioned among the three gluzincins. ZMP residues involved in substrate recognition (ie, side\u2010chain specificity) are chemically conserved and positioned orthogonally to the catalytic ZMP residues forming a sandwich\u2010like motif. (B) Putative catalytic and specificity sites within Ste24. Ste24 TM \u03b1\u2010helices V, VI and the \u03b23\u2010strand of the L5D form the equivalent canonical gluzincin structure motif found in the homologous gluzincin structures. As in the neprilysin and G sulfurreducens ZMP structures, Ste24 possesses an extra domain, in this case a transmembrane (TM) heptahelical \u201c\u03b1\u2010barrel,\u201d situated above the gluzincin motif. Investigation of this region in Ste24 implicates additional residues of the \u03b13 element of the L5D and the \u03b16/\u03b17\u2010helices of the CTD as important for catalytic and specificity roles. Note that the four catalytic residues Asn263, Ala264, His434, and Arg440 (SmSte24 numbering) are absolutely conserved and identically positioned among all four gluzincins",

Functional and structural analyses of homologous, soluble gluzincin orthologs (see Figure 2A) reveal the complete ZMP Core module of Ste24 to be comprised of elements from the CTD (\u03b15\u2010helix, \u03b17\u2010helix, and \u03b17\u2010loop), TM \u03b1\u2010helices (VI and VII), and L5D (\u03b23\u2010strand and \u03b13\u2010helix) (see Figure 2B). For clarity, the loop element leading to \u03b17 within CTD is represented by a thin rectangle but does not possess \u03b1\u2010helical secondary structure. Catalytic and substrate specificity regions are indicated by C and S1\u2032, respectively; SmSte24 residues which are absolutely conserved in Ste24 and within these regions are explicitly labeled and bracketed. B, Superposition of the unbound SmSte24 structure with our recently determined structure of HsSte24 complexed with the ZMP inhibitor phosphoramidon (PDB 6BH8).35 For clarity, only the phosphoramidon molecule (shown as green sticks) of the HsSte24:phosphoramidon structure is displayed. The three\u2010dimensional image of the ZMP Core module is oriented and labeled to match the schematic cartoon presented in panel (a). Residues contributing to the catalytic (C) and specificity (S1\u2032) functions are explicitly labeled, shown as sticks, and their respective surfaces shown. The phosphoramidon inhibitor is bound and coordinated by residues solely within the ZMP Core module of Ste24, in a binding pose analogous to that observed in its complexes with soluble gluzincins.35 C, The Ste24 Tripartite Architecture. The \u201cZMP Core\u201d module (dark gray ribbon and van der Waals surface) is shown in the three\u2010dimensional context of the entire Ste24 structure. Individual helix and strand elements constituting the ZMP core are labeled. Analogous to soluble gluzincins, the ZMP Core module is embedded between accessory structural elements (gray ribbon). Such \u201cZMP Accessory\u201d modules are highly variable in size, scope, and functional role even among highly homologous gluzincins. The ZMP core region is \u201ccapped\u201d by a large, membrane\u2010spanning region, the \u201c\u03b1\u2010barrel\u201d module, whose contribution to Ste24 catalytic activity is currently unknown (light gray ribbon).
