Additional rounds of refinements were performed using the phenix refine program implemented in the Phenix package with isotropic ADP refinement and bulk solvent modeling.

The unique substitutions and insertions (residues 334\u2013337) within HBoV1 compared to HBoV2\u20134 mapped primarily to the capsid exterior. Interestingly, among the 32 unique substitutions, 19 were related with serine or threonine (substitutions of S/T with other amino acids), which has a dramatic influence on the hydrophobicity of the protein.
