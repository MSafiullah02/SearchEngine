An online survey was distributed through a social media platform between January and February 2020. Participants completed a modified validated questionnaire that assessed the Impact of Event Scale (IES), indicators of negative mental health impacts, social and family support, and mental health-related lifestyle changes. A total of 263 participants (106 males and 157 females) completed the study. The mean age of the participants was 37.7 \u00b1 14.0 years, and 74.9% had a high level of education. The mean IES score in the participants was 13.6 \u00b1 7.7, reflecting a mild stressful impact. Only 7.6% of participants had an IES score \u226526. The majority of participants (53.3%) did not feel helpless due to the pandemic. On the other hand, 52.1% of participants felt horrified and apprehensive due to the pandemic. Additionally, the majority of participants (57.8-77.9%) received increased support from friends and family members, increased shared feeling and caring with family members and others. In conclusion, the COVID-19 pandemic was associated with mild stressful impact in our sample, even though the COVID-19 pandemic is still ongoing. These findings would need to be verified in larger population studies.",

Risk factors such as being female were associated with a higher risk of developing SARS-related post-traumatic stress symptoms [9] . Similarly, the impacts of MERS, H1N1 and Ebola epidemics on mental health including depression and substance use disorders have also been recorded [8] . Additionally, the populations may have experienced some known risk factors for depression and anxiety including high mortality rate, resource and food insecurity, discrimination, and experience with infected and sick individuals, which can lead to some adverse mental health outcomes during these epidemics [8] . In contrast, there have been >82,000 cases of COVID-19 with >2800 deaths within two months since the outbreak began in December 2019 [2] .

One possible reason for these findings was that during the pandemic, the pace of the whole society slowed down [12] . This could have then created more opportunities and time among the community members to support and care for each other [12, 15, 16] . Addition, during the Chinese Spring Festival, family members and friends were much valued and there was increased communication with family members and friends. Family members were more likely to care for each other and spend time together because they were asked to avoid going to public places and stay at home, especially during the Chinese Spring Festival [12, 15, 16] . Moreover, the Chinese Spring Festival is the most important Chinese festival because it marks the beginning of a new year according to the traditional Chinese calendar. It also signifies an opportunity for a fresh start and a hope of good things to come. Friends were also more likely to send regards to each other via WeChat and/or other social media [12, 15, 16] .

            "text": "Our study had several strengths. To the best of our knowledge, our study was one of first studies to offer a unique opportunity to investigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, as this study was conducted less than one week after the lockdown in Wuhan and other cities in Hubei Province was imposed by the Chinese government. This is particularly important, as this study serves as some of the first data about the mental health impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. Additionally, our study pilot-tested the validity of the questionnaires used to ensure that they were appropriate in our study context and setting. However, our study suffered from the limitations associated with the small number of the sample size, poor adherence to the study and the convenience sampling method, which limited the generalization of our findings to the whole Chinese population in mainland China. It is also possible that the participants were limited to only those who have the financial, emotional, and mental latitude to actually answer these questions, which might have skewed all of the answers towards those expected of a \"healthier\" population in this context. Additionally, to what degree these study responses might have been affected by perceived monitoring of responses among our participants remain uncertain. Amid this moment of heightened security, especially cybersecurity aimed at playing down the crisis, any kind of critical responses or indication that may belie a sense of things being out of control would be monitored or suppressed. Additionally, the possible recall bias from participants may have confounded our findings. The income level of participants was not assessed in our study. Although we collected the occupational information of the participants, we did not collect specific details including whether their occupation was related to healthcare. Additionally, we did not collect information on whether participants had a relative/friend who contracted the virus or who developed symptoms.",

Participants were asked to refer to the information regarding COVID-19 updates and the prevention measures released by the government. Large-scale studies with both qualitative and quantitative methods should be conducted in all regions of China to investigate the mental health and quality of life among Chinese residents, especially in the areas most severely impacted by the pandemic (e.g., Wuhan and other cities in Hubei Province). Following the current study, we will conduct a long-term follow-up study on these same participants as well as a large-scale survey to explore whether there were any significant changes in the mental health impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. We will also investigate whether these participants develop post-traumatic stress after the COVID-19 pandemic is over. Hopefully by then, we will have some ideas on what transmits the SARS-CoV-2 virus and how this virus comes through. This will then provide some important information for community health workers in mainland China to help them tackle these mental health-related issues in response to other similar societal disasters. It is also imperative for mental health workers to be aware that such traumatic stress symptoms could lead to the development of avoidance behaviors or passive lifestyles after the pandemic. We strongly urge that health workers should include mental health promotion as part of their follow-up after the pandemic.",

For example, if younger participants express a stronger sense of helplessness, which may be correlated with an increased use of social media. This is because young participants may watch and listen to more and more negative news which will then intensify their feelings of anxiety and depression in times of crisis. Therefore, questions about social media use, or internet use, or news consumption, would be helpful to understand the impact of such epidemics on mental health. Moreover, questions about relatives/friends who have contracted the virus, health history of the individuals, and their relationship with healthcare sectors (for work), and existing mental health issues should also be included.",
