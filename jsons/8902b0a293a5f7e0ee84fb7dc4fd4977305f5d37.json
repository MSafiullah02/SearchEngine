The chance floating of a spore from one research laboratory to another would have made no difference to human history had it not been for the presence, in a single building, of research programmes into what, at the time, seemed the quite different topics. Nor would the spore have developed in the culture in which it landed, had the researcher whose Petri dish it was not been on vacation, and the weather in his absence been unusually warm. And none of this would have made any difference had the researchers in question not been friends, who, between them, were able to detect a signal of potential medical significance. This signal had been undetected over a decade earlier, when an anti-bacterial effect of the penicillin mould had been observed as nothing more than a curiosity. The risky decision on the part of a single individual to devote all the resources of a single make-shift laboratory in wartime Britain, with German invasion imminent, was also remarkable, and crowning it all is modern medicine's 'mystery of mysteries': \"the question of how, and more particularly why, a handful of the simplest of micro-organisms should have the ability to create these complex chemicals, or why they should exist at all\"(Le Fanu, 2012, p. 26) . While the development of antibiotics did require considerable human perseverance, it also required remarkable luck.",

In contrast to the milestone surgical developments, which for the most part are more direct results of creative thinking by determined individuals persevering on a stubborn problem (e.g. open heart surgery, hip replacement, organ transplant), the major pharmaceutical discoveries have been largely accidental. Several other major pharmaceutical discoveries have concerned substances already known and being deployed, or investigation, for some purpose other than the one for which they were to become famous, for example cortisone and sildenafil citrate (Viagra).",

However, no testing process is without risk, and when there is a strong incentive to achieve a positive outcome, these processes are under pressure. The huge social and, perhaps, financial benefits of developing an effective preventive or curative intervention for COVID-19 create pressures of this kind.",

These groups are then to be compared for drug use, and common drugs among patients apparently doing better against COVID -19 (the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 infection) can then referred for further testing. This is a simple, practical idea, and one with an excellent epidemiological pedigree, besides the parallel with natural experiment that the author highlights. The method shares a common structure with the epidemiologically seminal case-control study, developed for detecting causal effects of diseases whose course runs too long for impatient mortal investigators to observe with sufficient frequency to draw results (and whose suspected cause, smoking cigarettes, had become widespread only relatively recently when the connection became of interest and concern). Speed is thus a central purpose of the method, explaining the utility of its application to accelerate the process of drug discovery.",

However, Daughton does clearly acknowledge that the method is not the final word on causality, but rather a way of providing promising leads for rigorous follow-up. Used this way, as it is proposed, Daughton's method inherits the virtues of the case-control design made famous by the discovery of the cause of almost all lung cancer.",
