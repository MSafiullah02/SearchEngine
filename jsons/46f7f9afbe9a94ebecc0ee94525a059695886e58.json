Following that notion, we have developed a model and then employed it for forecasting future COVID-19 cases in India. The study indicates an ascending trend for the cases in the coming days. A time series analysis also presents an exponential increase in the number of cases.

It is observed that the number of recoveries as well as deaths increase with time, however the rate of recovery is higher than the death rate. Thus, a low mortality rate could be expected from the disease. Figure 5 shows a comparative study of confirmed COVID-19 infection cases of India with respect to those of highly infected countries. According to the plot, US is the most infected while India the least infected of the selected countries, viz. US, Spain, Italy, France, Germany, China and Iran. It is very obvious as India was the last amongst these countries to get infected. However, the plot also reflects that China has been able to control the pandemic and is now presenting very few new cases. Thus, it follows that if strict prevention measures such as quarantine and sanitization are continued for some days, the situation could be controlled in the coming days.",

It is clear that measures like quarantine and sanitization can decrease human exposure and control this pandemic. Thus, these measures should be stringently imposed in India and strict actions must be taken against those people who violate the rules and don't consider the severity of the situation. Although a large amount of data helps in providing a more exhaustive prediction and explanation, in the present circumstance, these models could be valuable in anticipating future cases of infection if the pattern of virus spread didn't change abnormally. It is obvious that this virus is new and has the capability to be transmitted intensely. Hence, it may have an influence on the predictions, however as per our knowledge, in the present situation this model is the finest.",

In order to support the prevention of the disease and aid in the healthcare service preparation, we have conducted this study to examine the finest model for the prediction of confirmed COVID-19 infection cases and to employ that model for forecasting future COVID-19 infection cases in India. As per the model forecast, the confirmed cases are expected to greatly rise in the coming days. The time series analysis shows an exponential enhancement in the infected cases. However, it is also anticipated that the efforts such as lockdown may affect this prediction and cases may start to decline after a month approximately. A comparative study with some of the highly infected countries and countries in south-east Asia region indicates that India can still control the situation if the prevention measures such as quarantine and city sanitization are strictly followed. The prediction models will help the government and medical workforce to be prepared for the upcoming situations and have more readiness in healthcare systems.",

A slight deviation of residuals from the straight line can be observed from the plot. This indicates that the errors are somewhat near to normal with a few outliers. Therefore, the normality assumption is followed. The residual histogram backs up this assumption. The graph between residuals and the fitted values displays a little dispersion. This implies that the assumption of constant variance is also satisfied by the model. The noncorrelation of residuals is clear from the plot of residuals versus the order of the data. The Ljung Box statistics further corroborate this fact(Table 3). It is transparent that the p-value of all the lags is larger than the significance level (i.e. 0.05) which means there is no violation of independent assumption. The suitability of the ARIMA (2, 2, 2) model is indicated by the non-significance of p-value and other statistics.",

            "text": "CI). According to the forecast, the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases is expected to increase considerably in the coming 20 days. This increase is highly suspected to be associated with the people involved in a large social gathering which took place just before the lockdown was imposed. Many of them have been tested positive while a number of them are still untraceable. Thus, these people may cause transmissions and lead to higher number of infected figures. Another reason may be the negligence on the part of a few people who didn't follow the suggested 14 day isolation after returning from abroad. Further, there is still a possibility that the transmission might be occurring from asymptomatic cases with/without a travel history. It is also suspected that there are many asymptomatic cases which are still not tested. To some extent, social media is also contributing towards some cases owing to the fake information being spread through the platform. It is very important to control such communications as they result in people moving out of their places due to wrong informations. All these circumstances can end up in transmissions. Apart from that, until now, it hasn't been confirmed whether a recovered person can act as a carrier of the virus or not. Further, if it is possible, then for how long.The lockdown period that began from 25 March 2020 has been extended up to 3 May 2020 considering the present cases according to the current update. It has been noted that some people have ignored the situation and warnings which resulted in a hasty increase in the number of infected cases. Hence, it is extremely crucial that people are made aware of the situation and the lockdown is strictly imposed in the whole country to prevent further transmission of the infection. If stringent measures are taken, it is believed that the number of new infected cases should begin declining in approximately 20 days. Looking at the prevention approach employed",
