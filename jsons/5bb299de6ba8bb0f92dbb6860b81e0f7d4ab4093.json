We conducted a retrospective observational study in three ICUs in Bretagne, France. All patients admitted from January 2016 to September 2017 with a length of stay of 2 days or more were included. Universal screening for ESBL-GNB colonization was performed in all participating ICUs. Of the 3250 included patients, 131 (4.0%) were colonized at admission, 59 acquired colonization while hospitalized (1.9%; 95% CI [1.5-2.5%]), and 15 (0.5%; 95% CI [0.3-0.8%]) acquired ESBL-GNB infections. In the case of infection, the specificity and the negative predictive values of preexistent colonization for the ESBL-GNB etiology were 93.2% [91.5-95.1%] and 95.2% [93.5-97.1%], respectively. Colonization was the main risk factor for ESBL-GNB AI (OR = 9.61; 95% CI [2.86-32.29]; p < 0.001). Antimicrobial susceptibility of non-ESBL-GNB isolates responsible for AI was similar for any non-carbapenem \u03b2-lactam (95%) and imipenem (94%). ESBL-GNB AIs were rare in ICUs with low ESBL-GNB prevalence rate. Prior colonization was the main risk factor for subsequent infection. Empirical carbapenem therapy could be avoided in non ESBL-GNB colonized patients with suspected AI.",

It consists of the administration of topical antibiotics (tobramycin, colistin, and amphotericin B) four times daily in the oropharynx and the gastric tube, chlorhexidine body washing, and nasal mupirocin, in all intubated patients for the period of intubation [16] . The other two units were polyvalent ICUs with 14 beds (ICU 2) and 12 beds (ICU 3). Every ICU followed the recommendations of the French Society for Hospital Hygiene regarding the prevention and treatment of AI (available at https://sf2h.net). Each center had a nosocomial infection committee for the prevention and prospective census of AI. We screened all admitted patients from January 1, 2016, to September 10, 2017. Patients with a length of stay of 2 days or more were included. Because rectal screening for ESBL-GNB colonization and report of AIs are routine care, the institutional ethics committee approved the study and the requirement for written informed consent was waived.",

In patients with suspected or confirmed infection, the relative risk for the ESBL-GNB etiology after prior colonization with ESBL-GNB has been diversely assessed depending on local epidemiology. Houard et al. [19] reported a relative risk of 2.6 [1. 2-5.6] in an ICU with ESBL-GNB prevalence rate of 48%. In contrast, Bruy\u00e8re et al. [15] found a much higher risk (77.5 [23.7-253.4] ) in ICUs with a prevalence rate of 7.3%. In our study, the relative risk was not as high (6.6 [2.2-17.6]). Differences were due to the lower rate of ESBL-GNB AI in non-colonized patients reported by Bruy\u00e8re (0.6% versus 4.8% in our study), also explaining the higher negative predictive value of prior colonization in this study (99.5% versus 95.2%).",

ESBL-GNB infection in non-colonized patients has been reported previously with various rates. Jalalza\u00ef et al. [22] . The exogenous source of multidrugresistant GNB has been examined in the study of Harris et al. [23] . From 1806 previously non-colonized patients, the authors reported 27 patients with ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumonia acquisition among whom there were 14 patients (52%) with an isolate similar by molecular typing to an isolate from another patient with an overlapping length of stay in the hospital. The authors suggest that patient-to-patient transmission is an important and underappreciated cause of ESBLproducing Klebsiella pneumonia infection and colonization [23] . In contrast, Tschudin et al. reported that only 1.5% of acquired colonization was due to patient-to-patient transmission [24] . An environmental contamination as a reservoir for ESBL-GNB colonization has recently been emphasized for Klebsiella pneumoniae [25] . We observed that admission to ICU 1 was protective for ESBL-GNB acquisition. A major difference between ICU 1 and ICUs 2 and 3 was the use of MSD in intubated patients. The benefit of selective decontamination regimens on acquired colonization with multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacilli has been shown in France [26] as in other European countries [27] . However, selective digestive decontamination does not prevent patient-topatient cross-transmission.",
