Taken together with previous surveillance studies that did not detect LUJV in 420 wild-captured rodents, 33, 34 it seems plausible to speculate that a rare and unlikely transmission event led to the infection of a human by LUJV.

At the private hospital involved in the LUJV outbreak, the level of awareness for possible VHF was low, 24 and without intervention this is likely also to be the case at over-crowded government clinics that serve poor communities in Lusaka. Health-seeking behavior may involve visiting traditional healers that would also delay diagnosis, as documented in West Africa during the recent EVD epidemic. 45 Zambia's high burden of human immunodeficiency virus/TB, malnutrition, and other diseases of poverty could also impact on the size and impact of a future outbreak.

A range of factors, both human (population demographics, health seeking behavior, burial practices, government response, etc.) and viral (pathogenicity and transmissibility of the specific virus strain) have probable impact on eventual outbreak size and impact, but molecular confirmation of the presence of a hemorrhagic fever virus is now the seminal event that gives local and international health officials the confirmation they need to mobilize a comprehensive infection control response. Having functional molecular diagnostic capacity nationally or regionally is key to the control of future VHF outbreaks.The first consideration for laboratory diagnosis of highly pathogenic viruses is biological safety. History has shown that laboratories are high-risk environments,49 and there needs to be a comprehensive plan and standard operation procedures in place, to ensure worker safety and outbreak prevention. VHF viruses are BSL-4 pathogens, but due to the cost of construction and maintenance, these facilities are available at just a few centers and are primarily required for infecting cell culture or culturing dangerous pathogens. For diagnosis in the field or at a national reference laboratory, the West African EVD outbreak has led to well-established protocols for \"relatively\" safe collection of specimens and specimen handling for molecular diagnosis, 50 with emphasis and training on appropriate personal protective equipment and specimen handling techniques. Importantly, these safety measures need to be applied to specimens collected from any contacts of the index case, before the specific etiological agent is confirmed. For known VHF pathogens there are more molecular diagnostic assays becoming available.48 WHO recently approved 6 new rapid", "latex": null, "type": "table"}, "TABREF6": {"text": "Identity matrix showing amino acid percentage identity, for all 4 viral proteins, between LUJV and representative OW and NW arenaviruses Abbreviations: GAIV, Gairo virus; JUNV, Jun\u00edn virus; LASV, Lassa fever virus; LCMV, Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus; LNKV, Lusaka New-Kasama virus; LUAV, Lusaka-Namwala virus; MOBV, Mobala virus; MOPV, Mopeia virus; MORV, Morogoro virus; MWV, Merino walk virus; NW, New World; OW, Old World; TCRV, Tacaribe virus; WENV, Wenzhou virus. immunochromatographic tests, and 1 multiplex PCR test. 51 A modest stock of such diagnostics, including positive and negative controls, reordered on expiry, would cost little and could be embedded into ongoing training and skills development activities. In contrast to the traditional technology of cell culture, molecular techniques do not run the risk of amplifying infectious material.In Zambia, the University of Zambia School of Veterinary Medicine BSL-3 laboratory has been nominated by the Zambian Ministry of Health as the national outbreak response diagnostic facility. Diagnosis of suspected patients of VHF is currently performed using conventional real-time PCR with sets of primers for the detection of Ebola, Marburg, Lujo, and Lassa fever viruses.52 Sanger sequencing facilities are also available but are of limited use for detecting unknown/novel VHF viruses (species or strains) that are not detected by the available assays.Plans are being drawn up to invest in next generation sequencing technology, through the new Illumina MiniSeq and/or Oxford Nanopore minION sequencer, the latter of which has already been used in the field to study the molecular epidemiology of Ebola.53 In the absence of suspected VHF patients, these technologies will be actively used for research projects on other infectious disease priorities, building the human resource capacity to offer rapid pathogen identification services in the event of future VHF or respiratory virus outbreaks.Lujo virus causes severe hemorrhagic fever with highly permissive human-to-human transmission and high case fatality. The animal reservoir and mode of transmission to humans are unknown, and the virus is phylogenetically equidistant from other major OW arenaviruses. The limited nature of the LUJV outbreak in 2008 was fortuitous, but the identity, location, and scale of possible future arenavirus or other VHF outbreaks cannot be predicted. For this reason the development of diagnostic capacity across the region is essential to facilitate a rapid and effective response. For known VHF pathogens, national governments should ensure that appropriate and effective means for diagnostic response is embedded within their leading research institutions. For identifying novel VHF pathogens, the required technology is becoming increasingly more available and affordable and could be used for a range of research activities, training, and building up the skills and experience of personnel to respond effectively to novel infectious disease diagnostic challenges.", "latex": null, "type": "table"}}, "back_matter": []}
