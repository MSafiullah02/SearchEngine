            "text": "RNA has a breathtaking variety of biological functions, which far exceeds its classical role as a carrier of genetic information. This range of functions is particularly exemplified in RNA viruses where the genome directs translation of viral proteins, functions as a template for the synthesis of new viral genomes and/or messenger RNAs (mRNAs), and is packaged in viral particles for subsequent infections. These functions are facilitated by specific structures or configurations in the viral RNA (Nicholson & White, 2015), and interactions with viral and cellular RNA binding proteins. Thus, to ensure a successful infection cycle, viruses intimately interact with, subvert and/or avoid cellular RNA transcription, splicing, translation, storage, and decay pathways (Cross, Michalski, Miller, & Wilusz, 2019). More recently, the deposition of chemical moieties on viral RNA has been shown to be a pivotal regulator of spatiotemporal viral gene expression (Gonzales\u2010van Horn & Sarnow, 2017).",

            "text": "RNA may be posttranscriptionally modified with different chemical moieties or marks. To date, more than 150 RNA modifications with very distinct chemical and structural properties have been discovered on all four canonical ribonucleotides as well as on noncanonical nucleotides such as pseudouridine and inosine (Boccaletto et al., 2018; Cantara et al., 2011; Limbach, Crain, & McCloskey, 1994; Machnicka et al., 2012). RNA modifications were first described in the 1960s and 1970s and initial studies focused on highly abundant RNAs such as ribosomal RNA (rRNA) and transfer RNA (tRNA). Because of the dearth of effective analytical tools, incomplete knowledge of the enzymes involved in the biogenesis of these marks, and the lack of a robust framework for understanding their regulatory and metabolic significance, the biological functions of the vast majority of RNA modifications are still largely unknown. The emergence however, of sensitive high\u2010throughput techniques combined with select available reagents (Schwartz & Motorin, 2017), and the identification of some of the biogenic enzymes that deposit (writers), remove (erasers) or facilitate function (readers) have enabled studies investigating the role of RNA modifications or the epitranscriptome in cellular RNAs. RNA modifications have been shown to impact numerous posttranscriptional RNA processes. Here we focus on how RNA viruses are influenced by RNA modifications. In particular we present an overview of the viral and cellular enzymes involved in depositing chemical moieties on viral RNA, as well as the consequence of specific RNA modifications on distinct steps in the infectious cycle and the innate immune response.",

            "text": "Given the critical role of the cap structure on cellular mRNAs, it is hardly surprising that many viruses similarly install a cap on the viral RNA. Interestingly, the m7G modified nucleotide blocking the 5\u2032\u2010end was first identified in viral RNAs prior to the identification on cellular mRNAs (Furuichi, Morgan, Muthukrishnan, & Shatkin, 1975; Furuichi, Shatkin, Stavnezer, & Bishop, 1975; Rose, 1975; Wei & Moss, 1975). To cap viral RNAs, viruses use different strategies such as usurping the nuclear capping machinery, \u201cstealing\u201d caps from cellular mRNAs, and encoding viral capping enzymes (Decroly & Canard, 2017; Decroly, Ferron, Lescar, & Canard, 2012; Dong, Zhang, & Shi, 2008; Ramanathan, Robb, & Chan, 2016). For a comprehensive overview of the mechanisms and functions of viral RNA caps we refer the reader to the excellent reviews by Decroly et al. (2012), Decroly and Canard (2017) and Ramanathan et al. (2016). A number of viruses with cytoplasmic infectious cycles virally encode a methyltransferase protein that adds a guanosine cap, although the mode by which the guanosine is added and methylated differs with each virus. Curiously, the RNA from some alphaviruses, a flavivirus, and human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV\u20101) have also been shown to harbor not only the canonical m7G cap but also di\u2010 and tri\u2010methylated guanosine caps (Dong, Ren, Li, & Shi, 2008; Hsuchen & Dubin, 1976; van Duijn, Kasperaitis, Ameling, & Voorma, 1986; Yedavalli & Jeang, 2010). Regardless of the capping mechanism, the monomethylated m7G cap facilitates efficient translation of viral proteins and protects the viral RNAs from degradation by cellular exonucleases (Figure 1b, Table 1) (Decroly et al., 2012; Ramanathan et al., 2016).",

            "text": "Methylation of the ribose 2\u2032\u2010hydroxyl group (2\u2032\u2010OH) has been known since the 1960s (Baskin & Dekker, 1967). Ribose 2\u2032\u2010O\u2010methylation in different cellular and viral RNAs occurs on all four ribonucleotides and on noncanonical nucleotides such as pseudouridine and inosine (Ayadi, Galvanin, Pichot, Marchand, & Motorin, 2019). While the biological function of internal 2\u2032\u2010O\u2010methylated nucleotides is incomplete, the installation of this modification on the first and second nucleotides of cellular mRNAs to produce a Cap 1 or Cap 2 structure (Figure 1) serves as a molecular signature of \u201cself\u201d (Table 1) (Hyde & Diamond, 2015). As such many viruses mimic the Cap 1 structure by either reappropriating caps from cellular mRNAs onto viral RNAs, or by encoding a viral 2\u2032\u2010O methyltransferase (MTase). In particular, the methyltransferase encoded by Corona\u2010, Arteri\u2010, Rhabdo\u2010, Filo\u2010, Paramyxo\u2010, Pox\u2010, and Reoviridae families and some viruses within the Flaviviridae family exhibits two enzymatic functions that N7\u2010methylate the guanosine cap and 2\u2032\u2010O\u2010methylate the ribose 2\u2032\u2010OH of the first nucleotide of the viral RNA (Decroly et al., 2012). Daffis et al. (2010) elucidated the function of the 2\u2032\u2010O\u2010methylation on the first nucleotide of the viral RNA, and showed that the addition of the 2\u2032\u2010O\u2010methyl modification at this particular position protected the viral RNA from the innate immune response pathway by camouflaging the viral RNA as a cellular mRNA (Daffis et al., 2010). The innate immune response is a critical cellular pathway that functions to limit pathogens. Particular molecular signatures within pathogens (for example double\u2010stranded RNA, 5\u2032\u2010triphosphate RNA, or non\u20102\u2032\u2010O\u2010methylated RNA) when recognized by cellular sensors initiate signaling cascades resulting in expression of type I interferon and cytokines (McFadden, Gokhale, & Horner, 2017). Secretion of interferon\u2010\u03b1 (IFN\u2010\u03b1) and IFN\u2010\u03b2 in turn stimulate signaling in neighboring cells by binding the type I interferon receptor (IFNAR). Subsequent propagation of the intracellular signals through Jak kinase and STAT transcription factors results in the expression of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) with specific antiviral activities. For example, ISGs encoding protein kinase R (PKR), ISG56 (IFIT1), and ISG54 (IFIT2) function to limit translation and consequently influence viral gene expression.",

            "text": "That 2\u2032\u2010O\u2010methylation is a marker of \u201cself\u201d was first shown in West Nile virus (WNV). WNV belongs the Flaviviridae family of viruses and has a positive\u2010sense RNA genome containing a Cap 1 structure. This Cap 1 structure (m7GpppAm) is added by the methyltransferase domain of the viral NS5 protein (Y. Zhou et al., 2007), where specific amino acids within NS5 direct methylation of the guanosine cap and ribose 2\u2032\u2010OH moiety. Daffis et al. (2010) showed that WNV deficient in 2\u2032\u2010O MTase activity was attenuated in wild\u2010type mice but virulent in mice lacking Ifnar, the gene encoding the interferon (IFN) receptor (Daffis et al., 2010). Furthermore, when embryonic fibroblasts isolated from Ifnar\u2010deficient mice were infected with wild\u2010type or 2\u2032\u2010O MTase\u2010deficient viruses, both viruses induced the same amount of interferon mRNA. These data indicated that the intracellular sensors recognizing the viral RNA and promoting downstream signaling remained intact. Pretreatment of cells with IFN, inhibited mutant WNV more than the wild\u2010type virus, and this presented the possibility that an IFN\u2010induced gene might act on non\u20102\u2032\u2010O\u2010methylated WNV RNA (Daffis et al., 2010). Indeed, Daffis et al. (2010) demonstrated that interferon\u2010induced protein with tetratricopeptides (IFIT) proteins recognized non\u20102\u2032\u2010O\u2010methylated RNA genomes from three different viruses namely WNV, poxvirus, and coronavirus, and restricted the viral infection. Recent X\u2010ray crystallography studies revealed the mechanism by which the IFIT proteins discriminate between \u201cself\u201d and \u201cnon\u2010self\u201d RNA. In particular, IFIT is comprised of tetratricopeptide subdomains that assemble as a clamp around an internal RNA binding tunnel (Abbas et al., 2017). This internal RNA binding tunnel was found to only accommodate RNA with a m7G cap and non\u20102\u2032\u2010O\u2010methylated nucleotides. Modeling studies revealed that a space constraint within the RNA tunnel excluded a m7G\u2010capped RNA harboring ribose 2\u2032\u2010O\u2010methylation modifications. The cytoplasmic RNA senor, retinoic acid inducible gene I (RIG\u2010I) recognizes uncapped RNA containing a triphosphate at the 5\u2032\u2010end of RNA to activate innate immune signaling (Luo, Kohlway, Vela, & Pyle, 2012). RIG\u2010I, however like IFIT, is also able to differentiate between a capped RNA without and with the penultimate 2\u2032\u2010O\u2010methylated nucleotide (Devarkar et al., 2016; Ramanathan et al., 2016; Schuberth\u2010Wagner et al., 2015). As such by binding non\u20102\u2032\u2010O\u2010methylated nucleotides at the 5\u2032\u2010end of RNA, IFIT and RIG\u2010I proteins discriminate between cellular mRNA and pathogen RNAs (Abbas et al., 2017; Devarkar et al., 2016; Ramanathan et al., 2016; Schuberth\u2010Wagner et al., 2015). Additionally, by binding a \u201cnon\u2010self\u201d RNA without a 2\u2032\u2010O\u2010methyl modification, IFIT proteins also inhibit translation of the viral RNA by competing with cellular cap\u2010binding enzymes for the m7G\u2010cap (Habjan et al., 2013; Kimura et al., 2013; Kumar et al., 2014). Notably, the IFIT proteins restrict translation of viral mRNA by interacting with the eukaryotic initiation factor eIF3 that is pivotal in the assembly of translation initiation complexes (Hinnebusch, 2006). IFIT interaction with eIF3 blocks the assembly of the ternary complex containing eIF2, GTP and the methionine initiator tRNA (Met\u2010tRNAi) and/or the preinitiation complex comprised of the ternary complex, mRNA, and the 40S ribosome (Hui, Bhasker, Merrick, & Sen, 2003; Hui, Terenzi, Merrick, & Sen, 2005; Terenzi, Hui, Merrick, & Sen, 2006). Thus, the 2\u2032\u2010O\u2010methyl modification facilitates evasion of antiviral factors induced by the production of type I interferon in response to viral infection (Figure 2).",

Similar to WNV, the positive\u2010sense RNA genome of coronaviruses, a virus in the Coronaviridae family, contains a Cap 1 structure that is introduced by viral m7G and ribose 2\u2032\u2010O MTases (Bouvet et al., 2010; Chen et al., 2009; Decroly et al., 2008). Targeted mutation of the coronavirus Nsp16 protein ablates viral 2\u2032\u2010O MTase activity (Decroly et al., 2008). Infection studies comparing wild\u2010type virus and Nsp16 mutant coronaviruses showed that the mutant viruses had decreased replication kinetics but induced higher levels of IFN\u2010\u03b2 (Z\u00fcst et al., 2011). Infection studies in Ifnar\u2010deficient macrophages similarly showed high IFN\u2010\u03b2 levels. These data together indicated that increased interferon production was in response to a cytosolic RNA sensor, and not a result of the secondary signal arising from interferon production (Z\u00fcst et al., 2011). Interferon production in macrophages in response to coronavirus infection is dependent on the RNA sensor Mda5 (Roth\u2010Cross, Bender, & Weiss, 2008; Zalinger, Elliott, Rose, & Weiss, 2015). Therefore, as expected, interferon levels were undetectable in Mda5\u2010deficient macrophages infected with wild\u2010type and 2\u2032\u2010O MTase\u2010deficient coronaviruses. These data were corroborated by demonstrating that 2\u2032\u2010O MTase deficient coronaviruses replicated in mice deficient in the RNA sensors Mda5 and Toll\u2010like receptor 7 (TLR7) to the same extent as in Ifnar\u2010deficient mice (Z\u00fcst et al., 2011). Therefore, the ribose 2\u2032\u2010O\u2010methyl group on the first nucleotide marks viral RNA as \u201cself\u201d which prevents the activation of the RNA sensors Mda5, TLR7, and RIG\u2010I, as well as avoids recognition of RNA by the interferon\u2010induced translation inhibitors, IFIT1 and IFIT2 (Figure 2).",

            "text": "Studies investigating the 2\u2032\u2010O MTase activities of WNV and the closely related Dengue virus (DENV) NS5 protein found that the NS5 protein 2\u2032\u2010O\u2010methylated not just the penultimate nucleotide of the genome (adenosine) but also adenosines within the genome (Dong et al., 2012). The first clue to such activity came from an assay that measured methylation of uncapped RNA, which demonstrated that NS5, or the methyltransferase (MTase) domain of NS5 alone, could specifically methylate polyA, but not polyG, polyC, or polyU oligonucleotides. The NS5 MTase methylated a 12\u2010nucleotide oligomer containing just adenosine or N6,N6\u2010dimethyladenosine, but not an oligomer that contained 2\u2032\u2010O\u2010methyladenosines (Dong et al., 2012). The internal methylation activity modified homogenous oligonucleotides as well as uncapped truncated viral RNA, and 18S and 28S rRNA, indicating that this activity was not sequence specific. The authors also showed that viral genomes isolated from infected Aedes albopictus cell culture supernatants contained an estimated 3.4 \u00b1 0.5 2\u2032\u2010O\u2010methylated adenosines per genome (Dong et al., 2012). Interestingly the internal 2\u2032\u2010O\u2010methyladenosines activity required the same K\u2010D\u2010K\u2010E motif required for 2\u2032\u2010O methylation of the 5\u2032 cap. Transfection and expression of in vitro transcribed viral RNA containing internal 2\u2032\u2010O\u2010methyladenosines showed that the RNA modifications modestly decreased viral translation. Notably, however, the installation of 2\u2032\u2010O\u2010methyladenosines in the viral RNA significantly impaired replication, and in particular elongation of the viral RNA\u2010dependent RNA polymerase (Figure 2) (Dong et al., 2012). Incorporation of 2\u2032\u2010O\u2010methylated uridine, guanosine, and adenosine into short RNA strongly inhibits cytokine and interferon production resulting from activation of the endosomal immune sensor TLR7 (Petes, Odoardi, & Gee, 2017; Robbins et al., 2007). Therefore, in addition to modulating virus gene expression and interactions with the host, it is also possible that the internal 2\u2032\u2010O\u2010methylated adenosines limit innate sensing during virus entry, which for WNV and DENV occurs via the endosome, although such an effect remains to be verified (Cruz\u2010Oliveira et al., 2015). Interestingly, the ability of the methyltransferase to internally 2\u2032\u2010O\u2010methylate adenosines is not unique to WNV and DENV methyltransferases. Indeed, the methyltransferase domain in the polymerase or L (large) protein of Ebola virus, a negative\u2010sense RNA virus, was also shown to 2\u2032\u2010O\u2010methylate internal adenosines, although the function of these internal modifications is unknown (Martin et al., 2018). This internal 2\u2032\u2010O\u2010methylation addition by the Ebola virus methyltransferase however appears to be virus\u2010specific, as another negative\u2010strand RNA virus, but in a different virus family to Ebola virus, namely human metapneumovirus (hMPV), lacked this activity (Martin et al., 2018).",

Notably, these 2\u2032\u2010O\u2010methylated nucleotides in the HIV\u20101 genomes were shown to be installed by FTSJ3, a cellular 2\u2032\u2010O MTase (Ringeard et al., 2019). Efficient transcription of HIV\u20101 RNA is facilitated by the viral Tat protein that interacts with the transactivation response (TAR) element, an RNA structure at the 5\u2032\u2010end of the viral genome, which then recruits cellular RNA polymerase II (Ott, Geyer, & Zhou, 2011). The cellular TAR RNA binding protein (TRBP), which is known to interact with HIV\u20101 RNA, also forms a complex with FTSJ3 and MAT2A, a SAM metabolism protein (Ringeard et al., 2019).

(2019) showed that FTSJ3 isolated from cells, or recombinantly expressed, could 2\u2032\u2010O\u2010methylate radiolabeled m7GpppG to form m7GpppGm within the context of m7G\u2010capped HIV\u20101 RNA, and an oligonucleotide containing 27\u2010adenosines or uridines or guanosines, but not an oligonucleotide containing 2\u2032\u2010O\u2010methylated adenosines. RiboMethSeq and validation by primer extension analyses showed 2\u2032\u2010O\u2010methylated nucleotides were deposited by FTSJ3 at 17 positions within HIV\u20101 RNA isolated from viral particles (Ringeard et al., 2019). The function of these internal 2\u2032\u2010O\u2010methylated nucleotides was dissected by first isolating viral RNA from virions produced in FTSJ3 knocked\u2010out cells, and then transfecting this RNA into a pro\u2010monocytic cell line. HIV\u20101 RNA lacking (or having a reduced number of 2\u2032\u2010O\u2010methylated nucleotides) dramatically upregulated interferon\u2010\u03b1 and interferon\u2010\u03b2 mRNA levels by specifically activating the Mda5 cytosolic RNA sensor (Ringeard et al., 2019). Thus, similar to the ribose 2\u2032\u2010O\u2010methyl modification of the first nucleotide, internal 2\u2032\u2010O\u2010methylations may also enable viruses to escape immune sensing (Figure 2). It is also possible that these 2\u2032\u2010O\u2010methylated nucleotides within the HIV\u20101 genome might limit reverse transcriptase activity, similar to the internal 2\u2032\u2010O\u2010methyladenosines restricting the DENV NS5 RNA\u2010dependent RNA polymerase (Dong et al., 2012). Such a mechanism however remains to be demonstrated.",

While a percentage of 2\u2032\u2010O\u2010methyladenosines detected on the DENV and ZIKV genomes is likely the result of viral methyltransferase activity, the addition of the other 2\u2032\u2010O\u2010methylated nucleotides on DENV and ZIKV RNA might be deposited by cellular 2\u2032\u2010O MTases. The presence of 2\u2032\u2010O\u2010methylated nucleotides on HCV and poliovirus RNA isolated from infected cells and virions was surprising, particularly as both viruses replicate in the cytoplasm, have an uncapped RNA genome, and do not encode a methyltransferase. Thus, the deposition of 2\u2032\u2010O\u2010methyl marks on the viral RNA is likely the result of cellular 2\u2032\u2010O MTase activities. Recently fibrillarin, the cellular methyltransferase known to 2\u2032\u2010O\u2010methylate rRNA in the nucleolus (Reichow, Hamma, Ferr\u00e9\u2010D'Amar\u00e9, & Varani, 2007), was shown to be required by Hendra and Nipah viruses, as well as by other viruses within the same Paramyxoviridae family such as measles and mumps virus (Deffrasnes et al., 2016). Specifically, RNAi depletion of fibrillarin decreased viral titers, which could be rescued by overexpressing fibrillarin resistant to siRNA targeting. Using a single\u2010cycle infection assay and a minigenome assay, Deffrasnes et al. (2016) report that fibrillarin impacted viral RNA synthesis. Future assays will likely determine whether the effect on viral replication is the result of fibrillarin 2\u2032\u2010O\u2010methylating Hendra and Nipah virus mRNAs or negative\u2010sense genomes to affect translation, transcription, and/or replication by the viral polymerase protein. Since fibrillarin 2\u2032\u2010O\u2010methylates rRNA and is important for pre\u2010rRNA processing, it was also possible that depletion of fibrillarin altered the abundance, 2\u2032\u2010O\u2010methylation status or composition of functional ribosomes to affect translation of viral proteins and ultimately viral RNA synthesis (Erales et al., 2017; Mauro & Edelman, 2002; Z. Shi et al., 2017; Tollervey, Lehtonen, Carmo\u2010Fonseca, & Hurt, 1991). Deffrasnes et al. (2016) however, showed that depletion of fibrillarin had no effect on influenza virus infection, suggesting the effect on Hendra virus was not a result of ribosome biogenesis or translation deficiencies.",

In addition to affecting interactions with cellular components, processivity of the viral polymerase and evading immune sensing (Figure 2), 2\u2032\u2010O\u2010modification in RNA viruses might also impact actions required for efficient replication such as impair unwinding of viral RNA, or restrict critical changes in RNA configurations that modulate specific steps in the infectious cycle (Iglesias & Gamarnik, 2011; Nicholson & White, 2015).

The isomerization of uridine does not change the Watson\u2013Crick base\u2010pairing with adenosine, however pseudouridine is also able to base pair with any of the other nucleotides. While pseudouridine was first discovered in 1951 in rRNA and tRNA, the application of next generation sequencing coupled with CMCT (cyclohexyl\u2010N\u2032\u2010(2\u2010morpholinoethyl) carbodiimide metho\u2010p\u2010toluene\u2010sulfonate) labeling has enabled transcriptome\u2010wide analysis of pseudouridine and the identification of this modification on noncoding RNAs and mRNAs (Carlile et al., 2014; X.

Incubation of the TYMV\u2010RNA fragment with yeast extract or purified pseudouridine synthases PUS1 and PUS4 resulted in pseudouridylation of the RNA fragment (Becker, 1998). Interestingly, the intergenic region of the RNA3 segment of brome mosaic virus (BMV) within the Bromoviridae family contains a similar T\u2010pseudouridine stem loop structure of RNA (Baumstark & Ahlquist, 2001). Baumstark and Ahlquist showed that in BMV\u2010infected yeast and plants the intergenic region is pseudouridylated at a position that would correspond to the modified nucleotide in tRNA (Baumstark & Ahlquist, 2001). Notably, mass spectrometry profiling of RNA modification landscapes on the genomes of positive\u2010sense RNA viruses isolated from infected cells and virions showed that pseudouridine is an abundant modification on viral RNAs (McIntyre et al., 2018). Interestingly, PUS proteins were identified in a CRISPR screen for host factors targeting viruses in the Flaviviridae family such as HCV and DENV (Marceau et al., 2016). Although the PUS proteins were not the leading antiviral factors identified in the screen, these data lend support for future studies examining the impact of pseudouridine during viral infection.",

For instance, reverse transcription of HIV RNA is initiated by the interaction of the cellular tRNALys3 with the primer binding site within the HIV genome (Mak & Kleiman, 1997), where the interaction between the HIV RNA and the tRNALys3 was found to be stabilized by the pseudouridine within the cellular tRNA (Bilbille et al., 2009). Additionally, cellular tRNAs may suppress or promote translation of viral proteins. For example, a virus within the Virgaviridae family namely Tobacco mosaic virus has a weak UAG stop codon between two open reading frames where read\u2010through is required to produce the putative RNA\u2010dependent polymerase (Zerfass & Beier, 1992). Interestingly, tRNATyr isolated from tobacco and yeast contains pseudouridine in the anticodon loop (G\u03a8A). Rather than promoting read\u2010through, the interaction of this tRNATyr with the UAG stop codon counterintuitively terminates translation and thus inhibits the production of the larger protein. Zerfass and Beier (1992) showed that suppression of the translation of the viral polymerase was specifically the result of the pseudouridine within the anticodon of the tRNATyr.",

            "text": "In addition to pseudouridine being an abundant RNA modification, stress has also been shown to shown to affect the levels of pseudouridines (Carlile et al., 2014; X. Li et al., 2015), suggesting this RNA modification is inducible. Indeed, virus infections induce a stress response (Lloyd, 2013), and epitranscriptome\u2010wide analysis of mock\u2010 and RNA virus\u2010infected cells revealed undulations in pseudouridine abundance during infection (McIntyre et al., 2018). In mRNAs, pseudouridines were identified within the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 untranslated regions (UTRs) as well as within the coding region (Carlile et al., 2014). Considering this broad distribution of pseudouridine within an RNA, how might this RNA modification impact viral gene expression? Similar to tRNAs (Davis, 1995; Newby & Greenbaum, 2002), pseudouridines within viral RNAs might regulate or stabilize for RNA structure or affect interactions with tRNAs to modulate the viral proteome by frameshifting, misreading, or suppressing stop or nonsense codons. Incorporation of pseudouridines into synthetic mRNA facilitates immune evasion (Karik\u00f3 et al., 2008), stabilizes mRNAs (Anderson et al., 2011; Karik\u00f3 et al., 2008), impacts translation, and limits activation of the double\u2010stranded RNA protein kinase (Anderson et al., 2010; Aspden & Jackson, 2010), the stress\u2010 and interferon\u2010induced kinase that regulates cellular translation during stress by phosphorylating the translation initiation factor eIF2\u03b1 (Dalet, Gatti, & Pierre, 2015). Even these limited functions would have broad impacts on viral gene expression (Table 1). That the enzymes responsible for installing pseudouridine are known and high throughput approaches are available to identify the positions of pseudouridines within viral RNA presents unique and exciting opportunities to investigate the function this abundant nucleotide within different viral systems.",

            "text": "Infection with measles virus, a negative\u2010strand RNA virus in the Paramyxoviridae family, is typically acute. However, a rare and late outcome of acute measles infection is subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), where the virus establishes a persistent infection in the central nervous system (Griffin, Lin, & Nelson, 2018). Notably, SSPE patients have high titers against all measles virus proteins except against the matrix (M) protein, the nonglycosylated viral membrane protein (Hall, Lamb, & Choppin, 1979). Immunofluorescence studies of SSPE brain material similarly showed low expression of the M protein (Liebert, Baczko, Budka, & Ter Meulen, 1986). While M is not required for measles virus replication, the low abundance or absence of M expression inhibits the viral nucleocapsids from colocalizing with the viral glycoproteins at the cell membrane. Instead, the nucleocapsids accumulate in the cytoplasm and nucleus, thus promoting virus persistence by restricting virus spread (Patterson et al., 2001). Sequence analysis of M genes cloned from brain autopsies of SSPE patients revealed that 50% of uridine (U) residues in the M gene were changed to cytosine (C) (Cattaneo et al., 1988). The consequence therefore of these biased hypermutations included frameshift mutations and the introduction of a stop codon, which decreased M protein expression (Figure 4) (Cattaneo et al., 1988). ADAR was shown to be responsible for introducing the clusters of A\u2010to\u2010I (G) (or U\u2010to\u2010C, depending on RNA strand polarity) transitions during transcription and replication of measles virus (Bass, Weintraub, Cattaneo, & Billeter, 1989; Pfaller et al., 2015; Pfaller, Radeke, Cattaneo, & Samuel, 2014). ADAR has been reported to edit genomes of other viruses in the Paramyxoviridae family such as human respiratory syncytial virus (hRSV), parainfluenza virus 5 and hMPV (Mart\u00ednez & Melero, 2002; Rima et al., 2014; Samuel, 2011; van den Hoogen et al., 2014). Similar to measles virus, biased hypermutations were identified by sequence analysis in the glycoprotein (G) of hRSV changing the amino acid sequences and an antibody epitope within the G protein (Figure 4) (Mart\u00ednez et al., 1997; Rueda et al., 1994). That ADAR\u20101 is able to edit paramyxovirus genomes is intriguing particularly because the viral RNA is tightly associated with the nucleocapsid proteins (Gutsche et al., 2015). Thus, the double\u2010stranded RNA structures recognized by ADAR\u20101 are unlikely to form and to be edited from A\u2010to\u2010I. It is however possible that if nucleocapsid\u2010RNA genome interactions were disrupted, the viral genomes may be edited (Pfaller et al., 2014, 2015, 2018). Interestingly, the installation of inosine masks RNA from detection by the cytoplasmic sensor protein of dsRNA Mda5, thus preventing the synthesis of interferon and other inflammatory proteins (Liddicoat et al., 2015; Mannion et al., 2014). Thus, A\u2010to\u2010I editing in viral RNAs can introduce mutations that affect biological outcomes as well as suppress the innate immune response (Table 1) (Pfaller et al., 2018).",

            "text": "Perhaps the viral lifecycle most intricately tied to A\u2010to\u2010I editing is that of hepatitis \u03b4 virus (HDV), the only virus in the Deltaviridae family. Coinfection of HDV with hepatitis B virus (HBV) increases the risk of sever liver damage in HBV patients (Lempp, Ni, & Urban, 2016). HDV is a subviral pathogen in that the RNA genome encodes only one protein namely hepatitis delta antigen (HDAg), yet HDV is disseminated by co\u2010opting the HBV envelope proteins which encapsidates the HDV RNA (Rizzetto et al., 1980). The HDAg is an essential protein that directs two distinct steps in the virus life cycle, namely replication and assembly. These steps are regulated by distinct forms of HDAg. HDAg\u2010S, the small form of the protein, modulates replication, while the large form (HDAg\u2010L) inhibits replication and promotes virus assembly (Kuo, Chao, & Taylor, 1989; Ryu, Bayer, & Taylor, 1992). The circular negative\u2010sense RNA HDV genome is replicated through an RNA intermediate, the antigenome, which also serves as a template for transcription of viral mRNA. Notably, a significant number of the antigenomes were found to have a very specific uridine\u2010to\u2010cytidine substitution (Casey, Bergmann, Brown, & Gerin, 1992). An in vitro assay, using a double\u2010stranded RNA deaminase isolated from Xenopus levis eggs, radiolabeled in vitro transcribed antigenome RNA and thin layer chromatography, demonstrated inosine within the HDV RNA (Polson, Bass, & Casey, 1996). Using an editing assay and site\u2010directed mutagenesis studies, adenosine 1012 on the antigenome was shown to be specifically changed to inosine (Casey & Gerin, 1995; Polson, Ley, Bass, & Casey, 1998). In converting adenosine to inosine, which like guanosine preferentially base\u2010pairs with cytosine, the UAG amber stop codon of HDAg\u2010S is changed to UIG (or UGG), a tryptophan codon, thus permitting the translation of the elongated protein HDAg\u2010L (Figure 4). An important contribution to this specific editing comes from the structure of the HDV RNA. Notably, the HDV genome contains significant complementarity within the circular RNA to form a predicted rod\u2010like dsRNA structure, where stabilizing or destabilizing the secondary structure modulates the extent of A\u2010to\u2010I editing (Jayan & Casey, 2005). Additionally, the extent of editing is influenced by the nucleotides surrounding the edited adenosine, as well as by the nucleotides 3\u2032 of the editing site (Casey et al., 1992; Jayan & Casey, 2005). Editing was shown to occur during the replication step or synthesis of the antigenome (Sato, Cornillez\u2010Ty, & Lazinski, 2004). Thus, the secondary RNA structure and extent of editing influence HDAg\u2010L expression and synthesis of virus production. Because HDAg\u2010L inhibits replication, HDV maintains an exquisite balance between replication, A\u2010to\u2010I editing, and virus production (Table 1) (Sato et al., 2004). Assays using a nonreplicating HDV antigenome reporter and overexpression of ADAR\u20101 and ADAR\u20102 revealed that both deaminases are able to edit the HDV antigenome (Sato, Wong, & Lazinski, 2001). Subsequent studies however, using RNAi to differentially deplete cells of ADAR\u20102 or ADAR\u20101 p150, showed that ADAR\u20102 minimally, if at all, edited HDV RNA. In contrast, introduction of inosine into the HDV RNA was inhibited following depletion of both ADAR\u20101 p110 and p150. Depletion of ADAR\u20101 and overexpression of either ADAR\u20101 p110 or p150 revealed that the nuclear form of ADAR\u20101 p110 more efficiently promoted editing of the antigenome than ADAR\u20101 p150 (Wong & Lazinski, 2002). ADAR\u20101 p150 is only expressed following interferon induction, and the protein abundance is a fraction of the ADAR\u20101 p110 form, yet ADAR\u20101 p150 also edits the HDV RNA to promote HDAg\u2010L expression (and downregulation of HDV replication). As such, pegylated interferon\u2010\u03b1 has been used as an antiviral treatment of HDV, although newer drugs targeting other steps in the infectious cycles, and putatively fewer adverse effects, are being developed (Koh, Da, & Glenn, 2019; Mentha, Cl\u00e9ment, Negro, & Alfaiate, 2019).",

HIV\u20101 RNAs, like cellular mRNAs, are transcribed by the cellular RNA polymerase II and may be edited by ADAR (Doria et al., 2009; McIntyre et al., 2018; Phuphuakrat et al., 2008). Indeed inosines were first identified in the stem structure of the TAR element following injection of the in vitro transcribed TAR RNA into the nucleus of Xenopus oocytes and thin layer chromatography analysis (Sharmeen, Bass, Sonenberg, Weintraub, & Groudine, 1991). Deletion and mutagenesis studies identified the position of the edited adenosine, and editing was found to be dependent on Tat, the HIV\u20101 activator of gene expression (Sharmeen et al., 1991). Overexpression of ADAR\u20101 and ADAR\u20102 has been shown to increase the abundance of HIV\u20101 proteins (Doria et al., 2009; Phuphuakrat et al., 2008). This effect on HIV\u20101 protein levels was shown to be dependent on the editing activity of ADAR. Conversely, depletion of ADAR with target\u2010specific siRNAs depleted HIV\u20101 protein levels. The effect of ADAR on the viral protein levels was shown to be independent of the editing function and more likely a consequence of ADAR modulating translation by inhibiting the RNA\u2010activated protein kinase, PKR (Doria et al., 2009). Notably, this effect of ADAR on HIV\u20101 protein levels was more robust than the impact of ADAR with editing capabilities. Modulation of ADAR\u20101 abundance affected the levels of unspliced HIV\u20101 RNA in the cytoplasm. Sequence analysis showed that A\u2010to\u2010G (I) changes in the 5\u2032 UTRs of all HIV\u20101 transcripts including within the TAR and Rev response element (RRE), and Tat coding sequence (Doria et al., 2009; Phuphuakrat et al., 2008). Introduction of specific A\u2010to\u2010G substitutions in the RRE resulted in a codon change, increased the levels of the capsid (p24) protein and unspliced RNA, as well as the production of HIV\u20101 particles. Immunoprecipitation studies revealed that ADAR associates with both unspliced and spliced HIV\u20101 transcripts (Doria et al., 2009). Surprisingly however, these particles had low infectivity likely because of effects on reverse transcription. A\u2010to\u2010I editing has also been reported in another retrovirus namely Rous\u2010associated virus type 1 (Felder et al., 1994). In particular the U3 sequence, within the long untranslated repeat, contains a high number of A\u2010to\u2010G (I) substitutions. Although, the conversions did not affect transcription or replication of the viral genome, the polyadenylation signal was changed resulting in read\u2010through transcription to include cellular gene sequences (Felder et al., 1994). A\u2010to\u2010I editing impacts retrovirus gene expression, however the extent to which this occurs within the virus family and whether the molecular consequences are virus\u2010specific remain to be determined.",

Notably, A\u2010to\u2010I editing in HCV has been shown to exhibit antiviral activity (Taylor et al., 2005). In particular, interferon treatment of the hepatoma cell line stably expressing an HCV replicon decreased HCV RNA and protein levels. Reduced HCV protein levels were likely due to the effect of interferon\u2010mediated decrease in cap\u2010independent translation that is, translation from the HCV internal ribosomal entry site (IRES). Taylor et al. (2005) showed that overexpression of PKR (a regulator of translation induced by interferon) decreased replicon expression and overexpression of a dominant\u2010negative inactive PKR mutant modestly rescued IRES\u2010mediated activity in the replicon cell line. Interestingly however, the expression of an RNA that inhibits ADAR activity robustly rescued IRES\u2010mediated activity and HCV replicon RNA (Taylor et al., 2005). Sequence analysis of the HCV replicon RNA isolated from interferon\u2010treated cells showed mutative A\u2010to\u2010I editing, and thin\u2010layer chromatography demonstrated an increase in inosine in total RNA isolated from the replicon cells (Taylor et al., 2005). Together the data indicate that HCV RNA might be modified by ADAR, and that inhibiting ADAR activity promotes HCV gene expression. Bioinformatic analyses of ZIKV genomes from the African versus Asian lineages revealed more guanosine nucleotides, which may have arisen from A\u2010to\u2010I editing (Khrustalev et al., 2017; Piontkivska et al., 2017). These putative ADAR editing sites were found in sites of predicted secondary structure, and on both the positive and negative (a replication intermediate) RNA strands (Khrustalev et al., 2017). Knockout of ADAR in mouse embryonic fibroblasts induces an aberrant immune response and increased apoptosis (Liddicoat et al., 2015; Mannion et al., 2014). As such, ADAR editing of the ZIKV genomes has been proposed to be an evolutionary driver as well as a possibly contributor to the neuropathologies linked to the outbreak of ZIKV in the Americas (Lazear & Diamond, 2016).",

Early studies demonstrated that 55\u201360% of the influenza virus complementary RNA or mRNA contained methyladenosine, and a third of these modifications were found to be internal m6A (Krug et al., 1976). Moreover, analysis of the different influenza virus mRNAs revealed an uneven distribution of these m6A modifications (Narayan et al., 1987). The role of m6A on influenza virus RNA was recently investigated by Courtney et al. (2017), where knockout of the METTL3 writer decreased influenza virus protein and mRNA levels and virus titers, while overexpression of the YTHDF reader proteins promoted virus gene expression. RNA\u2010seq analyses of m6A and YTHDF\u2010binding sites showed putative modification sites in both the viral mRNAs and negative\u2010sense genomic RNA. Notably, the m6A sites were enriched towards the 3\u2032\u2010end of the viral RNA consistent with m6A topology in cellular mRNAs (Courtney et al., 2017). Collective mutation of m6A sites decreased the infection kinetics and decreased virus pathogenicity, which together indicated that m6A on the viral RNA positively regulates influenza virus gene expression (Figure 6, Table 1) (Courtney et al., 2017).",

Interestingly, this motif was first described from studies examining internal methylation on a virus in the Retroviridae family, avian sarcoma virus (ASV) (Dimock & Stoltzfus, 1977). Indeed, radiolabeling methyl\u2010moieties on B77 ASV RNA with [methyl\u20103H]methionine showed that in addition to the Cap 1 structure, 14\u201316 internal methyl modification were m6A (Stoltzfus & Dimock, 1976). RNase digestion of radiolabeled RNA and chromatography demonstrated that adenosine within the motif (G>A)\u2010m6A\u2010C was methylated (Dimock & Stoltzfus, 1977). RNA\u2010seq studies have more precisely defined the motif as DRm6ACH (where D may be G, A or U, R represents the purines G and A, and H may be U, C or A) (Dominissini et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2014). Similar studies undertaken with another retrovirus Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) also identified 10\u201315 m6A modifications. These modifications were not randomly distributed, instead the majority of sites occurred within 500\u20134,000 nucleotides of the 3\u2032\u2010end of the RNA genome (Beemon & Keith, 1977). Indeed RNA\u2010seq topology studies of cellular mRNAs have demonstrated that m6A sites are enriched in the 3\u2032 UTR near termination sites, 5\u2032 UTR and long exons (Dominissini et al., 2012; Meyer et al., 2012; J. Zhou et al., 2015). A subsequent biochemical study described seven m6A sites in the RSV RNA, and while the modification was dynamic, a number of the modified sites were upstream of consensus splice acceptor sequences. These data together with the accumulation of unspliced viral RNA following incubation of cells with cycloleucine, an inhibitor of internal methylation (Dimock & Stoltzfus, 1978; Stoltzfus & Dane, 1982) raised the possibility that m6A might modulate splicing of RSV RNA (Figure 6) (Kane & Beemon, 1985).",

            "text": "While m6A was identified on the RNAs of both RNA and DNA viruses in the 1970s (Beemon & Keith, 1977; Canaani et al., 1979; Hashimoto & Green, 1976; Krug et al., 1976), a renaissance in viral epitranscriptomics occurred following recent studies examining m6A and HIV\u20101 gene expression (Kennedy et al., 2016; Lichinchi, Gao, et al., 2016; Lu et al., 2018; Tirumuru et al., 2016). Immunoprecipitations and RNA\u2010seq studies identified numerous m6A sites in the HIV\u20101 genome. Interestingly, m6A was found in the regulatory 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 long terminal repeats (Kennedy et al., 2016; Tirumuru et al., 2016), Env and Rev genes and the RRE (Kennedy et al., 2016; Lichinchi, Gao, et al., 2016; Tirumuru et al., 2016). Knockdown or overexpression studies of the m6A writer, eraser, and reader proteins were undertaken to dissect the role of m6A in HIV\u20101 infection. Mechanistically, installation of m6A on the HIV\u20101 genome was found to modulate HIV\u20101 gene expression at early and late steps during infection (Lichinchi, Gao, et al., 2016; Lu et al., 2018; Tirumuru et al., 2016). By changing the abundance of the reader proteins and measuring early and late reverse transcription (RT) products, Tirumuru et al. (2016) demonstrated that m6A influences steps prior to the import of cDNA into the nucleus and integration into the cellular DNA. By overexpressing the reader proteins, more HIV\u20101 genomic RNA was immunoprecipitated with the reader proteins yet the overall abundance of viral RNA decreased at early times following infection, suggesting that m6A affects the stability of the viral RNA (Figure 6) (Tirumuru et al., 2016). Additional investigations will establish whether the presence of m6A alone or as a result of reader proteins binding the m6A moiety hinders reverse transcription (RT) activity such that aborted RT products are degraded or whether the recognition of the viral RNA by the reader proteins targets HIV\u20101 RNA for turnover. Indeed, the spatiotemporal mechanism of this function will be interesting to uncover particularly as the RT activity putatively occurs within the confines of the p24 capsid shell (Campbell & Hope, 2015) and the reader proteins are not packaged into viral particles (Tirumuru et al., 2016). Lichinchi, Gao, et al. (2016) identified two conserved m6A sites within a stem loop of the RRE. This stem loop is critical for binding the Rev protein and directing export of the viral RNA out of the nucleus. Both sites were verified by primer extension assay using either AMV or Tth reverse transcriptase (RT), where the presence of m6A in RNA stalls the Tth RT reaction. Furthermore, by modulating the writer and eraser levels, and thus the level of m6A modification on the genome, the extent of Rev binding to the RRE was altered. Notably, adenosine\u2010to\u2010guanosine mutation to disrupt the m6A consensus motifs, demonstrated that ablation of the second m6A site decreased the genomic RNA levels and nuclear export (Figure 6) (Lichinchi, Gao, et al., 2016). Two putative m6A binding sites the HIV\u20101 5\u2032 UTR were identified at or within proximity of the primer\u2010binding site (PBS) and dimer initiation sequence (DIS), respectively. PBS binding of cellular tRNALys is critical for new rounds of reverse transcription, while the DIS facilitates encapsidation of two HIV\u20101 genomes. Disruption of either or both m6A sites modestly affected newly synthesized HIV\u20101 proteins, however markedly impacted subsequent HIV\u20101 infections. These data, together with the HIV\u20101 RNA\u2010dependent interaction of m6A reader proteins with the unprocessed Gag protein suggest that m6A might also influence virus assembly (Figure 6) (Lu et al., 2018). Twenty putative m6A sites were recently identified in the RNA of another retrovirus, MLV (Courtney et al., 2019). Mutation of three m6A sites in the Env gene decreased intracellular and virion proteins, but not viral RNA levels when expressed from the proviral expression plasmid, and viral gene expression was reduced in subsequent infections. Overexpression of the YTHDF2 reader also increased MLV proteins, demonstrating a role for m6A in MLV gene expression (Figure 6) (Courtney et al., 2019).",

However, recent studies show that the RNA genomes of a number of viruses in the Flaviviridae and Picornaviridae families are m6A\u2010modified (Figure 6, Table 1) (Gokhale et al., 2016; Hao et al., 2019; Lichinchi, Zhao, et al., 2016; McIntyre et al., 2018). During HCV infection, manipulation of writer and eraser abundance altered intracellular HCV protein levels, virus titers, and the amount of HCV RNA in the extracellular media thus affecting the production of new virus particles (Gokhale et al., 2016). Notably, writer, eraser, and reader protein abundance did not influence virus replication. Interestingly, the reader proteins were found to colocalize with the core protein at lipid droplets, which are well characterized sites of virus assembly suggesting that the m6A regulatory proteins might modulate virus assembly (Gokhale et al., 2016; Vieyres & Pietschmann, 2019). Fourteen putative m6A sites were identified along the viral RNA, with no apparent gene or distribution bias. Interestingly, mutation of four putative m6A sites in the envelope E1 gene dramatically increased virus titers without affecting HCV protein levels or translation or replication of the HCV genome. Disruption of m6A sites in the E1 gene decreased the amount of HCV RNA immunoprecipitated by the YTHDF2 reader but promoted an increased interaction with the core protein that surrounds the viral RNA (Gokhale et al., 2016). Therefore, this elegant study by Gokhale et al. (2016) demonstrated that the interaction of reader proteins with m6A\u2010modified HCV RNA regulated the packaging of viral RNA into new virus particles (Figure 6). m6A immunoprecipitation and RNA\u2010seq, and mass spectrometry, showed that the genomes of other viruses within the Flaviviridae family such as ZIKV, DENV, WNV, and yellow fever virus are also m6A\u2010modified (Gokhale et al., 2016; Lichinchi, Zhao, et al., 2016; McIntyre et al., 2018). Additional studies altering the abundance of the writer, eraser, and reader proteins during ZIKV and enterovirus 71 infection have shown m6A modulates viral gene expression (Figure 6) (Hao et al., 2019; Lichinchi, Zhao, et al., 2016).",

Although m5C studies using bisulfite RNA\u2010seq analysis reveal no clear RNA motif within mRNAs, m5C\u2010modified nucleotides were found to be enriched in regions that were CG\u2010rich, immediately downstream of the AUG start codon, and in 3\u2032 UTRs (Yang et al., 2017). Notably for studies elucidating biological function, the enzymes critical for m5C deposition and function are known. In particular, RNA m5C methyltransferases belong to two specific subgroups of methyltransferases namely DNMT2 or NOL/NOP2/sun (NSUN) that use SAM as the methyl donor group (Bujnicki, Feder, Ayres, & Redman, 2004; Motorin, Lyko, & Helm, 2009). In mammals, seven NSUN proteins have been identified of which NSUN2 was found to specifically deposit m5C on mRNAs (Squires et al., 2012). While the m5C eraser enzyme is unknown, the RNA transport adaptor protein, Aly/REF export factor (ALYREF or THOC4) was identified as a putative reader enzyme that binds m5C sites within mRNA (Yang et al., 2017).",

            "text": "Early studies investigating the methylation status of Sindbis virus (SINV), a single\u2010stranded positive\u2010sense RNA virus in the Togaviridae family and alphavirus genus, used electrophoresis to separate 14C\u2010uridine\u2010labeled RNA and 3H\u2010methylated chemical groups. Dubin & Stollar, 1975 and Dubin et al. (1977) demonstrated that the SINV RNA was extensively methylated. In particular, one fourth to one half of all the internal methyl marks on intracellular viral RNA were attributed to m5C (Dubin et al., 1977), and m5C was found to exclusively decorate the subgenome that encodes the structural proteins required for assembly of new virus particles (Dubin & Stollar, 1975). Notably however, viral RNA packaged into virus particles lacked m5C marks. The position and function of m5C in SINV RNA are at present unknown, although a recent report demonstrated that Mt2, a gene encoding a m5C methyltransferase, was upregulated following infection of Drosophila with SINV (Bhattacharya et al., 2017). The goal of the study by Bhattacharya et al. (2017) was to elucidate the cellular mechanism by which the intracellular endosymbiont Wolbachia pipientis controlled virus infection in arthropods. Using Drosophila flies and a cell line as a model for SINV infection in mosquitoes, the authors established that Wolbachia\u2010infection downregulated SINV protein and RNA levels and decreased virus infectivity. An analysis of Drosophila immune response genes in mock\u2010infected flies, and in the absence or presence of Wolbachia demonstrated a significant upregulation of Mt2. Indeed modulation of Mt2 levels, by either knocked\u2010out or shRNA\u2010depletion approaches, increased SINV infectivity (Bhattacharya et al., 2017). Considering that intracellular SINV RNA, but not packaged viral RNA, is decorated with m5C it is possible that this epitranscriptomic mark is a critical spatiotemporal or innate immune response regulator of virus gene expression. Notably, an earlier report by Durdevic et al. (2013) revealed that Mt2 (or Dnmt) played a role in Drosophila innate immune responses. In particular, the authors showed that viral RNA and protein significantly increased following infection of Dnmt2 mutant flies with Drosophila C virus (DCV), a positive\u2010sense RNA virus within the Dicistroviridae family (Durdevic et al., 2013). Dnmt was also found to interact with DCV RNA raising the possibility that the viral genome is m5C\u2010modified and this modification plays a role in the Drosophila innate immune response (Durdevic et al., 2013).",

            "text": "Infection with DENV, ZIKV, HCV, poliovirus, and HIV\u20101 alters the m5C RNA landscape in cells. Moreover m5C is present on the viral RNA isolated from cells and from released virus particles (McIntyre et al., 2018). Using mass spectrometry to identify epitranscriptomic marks as well as m5C\u2010seq analyses Courtney et al. (2019) recently showed that MLV genomic RNA, isolated from virions and cells, harbored a number of different epitranscriptomic marks. To elucidate the function of these putative m5C modification sites, mutations were introduced at four positions within the polymerase gene to putatively inhibit deposition of m5C (Courtney et al., 2019). RNA\u2010seq validation of mutant MLV genomic RNA showed that m5C marks at the four mutated sites were indeed absent. Interestingly, the abundance of m5C modifications when analyzed by RNA\u2010seq showed an overall decrease of m5C across the mutant viral genome. Transfection of the wild\u2010type and m5C mutant proviral expression vectors demonstrated that mutation of the DNA sequence had a small effect on the production of MLV Gag p65 and p30 proteins and no effect on the genomic RNA levels. An analysis of the proteins and RNA levels in MLV particles released into the media from transfection of the provirus DNA plasmid, demonstrated a two\u2010fold decrease on the levels of Gag proteins without affecting genomic RNA abundance. Courtney et al. (2019) determined that disruption of the four m5C sites in the polymerase gene did not affect virus particle assembly; however, the absence (and overall reduction of m5C marks) decreased subsequent virus infectivity. Consistent with these data, RNAi depletion of the writer enzyme NSUN2 also modestly decreased MLV Gag protein levels, while overexpression of Flag\u2010tagged NSUN2 had no effect (Courtney et al., 2019). The modest effects on MLV gene expression might in part be a result of the discrepancy between the mass spectrometry and m5C\u2010seq analyses, where on the MLV genomic RNA 13 and 40 m5C marks were identified by each respective detection approach. It is feasible that some of the m5C sites identified by m5C\u2010seq analyses might represent 5,2\u2032\u2010O\u2010dimethylcytosine (m5Cm) requiring regulation by additional methyltransferases. Regardless, the data support a role for m5C in MLV infection. Interestingly, a subsequent round of infection of the newly produced mutant virions revealed a decrease in infectivity. This observation raises the possibility that similar to ribose 2\u2032\u2010O\u2010methylation and inosine m5C masks the viral RNA from innate immune sensing. Alternatively, m5C within MLV genomes influences RNA structure or another critical step such as reverse transcription. Notably detection strategies to map m5C sites are available, and the m5C writer and reader enzymes are known, which together open new prospects to unravel the role of m5C during virus infection.",

            "text": "The availability of antibodies and reactive chemicals to some RNA modifications together with RNA\u2010seq has enabled studies on the role of a few RNA modifications during virus infection. However with more than 150 known RNA modifications (Boccaletto et al., 2018; Cantara et al., 2011), the viral epitranscriptome is likely far more complex than we currently understand. To uncover the viral epitranscriptome, a systems\u2010wide approach with highly sensitivity and an agnostic identification of all possible RNA modifications is required. To this end, McIntyre et al. (2018) employed the unbiased platform of mass spectrometry to investigate RNA modification landscapes on the entire transcriptome harvested from mock\u2010 and virus\u2010infected cells. Using RNA affinity captures and mass spectrometry, the RNA genomes isolated from ZIKV, DENV, HCV, poliovirus, and HIV\u20101 were shown to be decorated with a stunning array of RNA modifications (McIntyre et al., 2018). More than 30 different RNA modifications were identified on the viral RNA genomes. Notably, extrapolation of m6A abundance relative to the number of adenosines within the viral RNAs demonstrated comparable levels of m6A when identified by mass spectrometry versus RNA\u2010seq approaches. For example, on HIV\u2010l RNA encapsidated in virus particles, McIntyre et al. (2018) estimated 11 m6A modifications per genome, and RNA\u2010seq studies by Lichinchi, Gao, et al. (2016) reported 12 m6As per genome. Other notable modifications on the viral genomes included 2\u2032\u2010O\u2010methylated nucleotides, 1\u2010methyladenosine, m5C, N4\u2010acetylcytosine an abundant modification that was recently shown to impact cellular mRNA translation (Arango et al., 2018), as well as m7G (McIntyre et al., 2018). Indeed, the identification of m7G in HCV and poliovirus RNA genomes is surprising particularly as both viruses lack 5\u2032\u2010cap structures. However, a new chemical\u2010assisted sequencing approach demonstrated internal m7G in mRNAs and a role for m7G in translation (Zhang et al., 2019). Using mass spectrometry, Courtney et al. (2019) also showed a number of different RNA modifications on the MLV genome. There are challenges towards decrypting the RNA code on viral genomes. For example, RNA\u2010seq studies are limited by the availability of reagents to specific RNA modifications, and nucleotide resolution of RNA modifications sites has yet to be established for mass spectrometric analysis of large RNAs, such as an RNA virus genome. Moreover, manipulation of the levels of RNA modifications may be difficult as many of the enzymes involved in the biogenesis and function of these modifications are largely unknown. Despite these challenges, the astounding number of modifications on RNA virus genomes highlights that viral epitranscriptomics is an exciting and largely unchartered field.",

Indeed, the range of functions of a single RNA modification such as m6A on virus infection demonstrates that epitranscriptomic marks are pivotal regulators of viral gene expression. As sensitive high\u2010throughput techniques and reagent availability emerge, together with the identification of different writers, erasers and readers, the interplay between the host and viral epitranscriptomes will be uncovered. Moreover, the effects on viral gene expression following overexpression or depletion of writer, eraser, and reader enzymes need to be carefully evaluated to determine whether the outcome is a direct or indirect consequence of changes in the viral or host epitranscriptome. Such knowledge will be critical to deciphering the regulatory functions of RNA modifications or the epitranscriptomic code. This code will broaden our understanding of virus\u2013cell interactions, identify new antiviral targets, and facilitate the development of novel therapeutics. Given that viruses have proven to be exquisite explorers of cellular and molecular biology, elucidating the viral epitranscriptome will likely also shed new light on the functions of the epitranscriptome in cellular RNA processes and increase our understanding of the myriad of health conditions linked to RNA malfunction.",
