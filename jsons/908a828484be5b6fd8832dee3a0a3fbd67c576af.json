The aim of this work was to develop relevant metrics to assess the quality of nursing care in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) where they are scarce. Main body: We conducted a scoping review using EMBASE, CINAHL and MEDLINE databases of studies published in English focused on quality nursing care and with identified measurement methods. Indicators identified were reviewed by a diverse panel of nursing stakeholders in Kenya to develop a contextually appropriate set of nursesensitive indicators for Kenyan hospitals specific to the five major inpatient disciplines. We extracted data on study characteristics, nursing indicators reported, location and the tools used. A total of 23 articles quantifying the quality of nursing care services met the inclusion criteria. All studies identified were from high-income countries. Pooled together, 159 indicators were reported in the reviewed studies with 25 identified as the most commonly reported. Through the stakeholder consultative process, 52 nurse-sensitive indicators were recommended for Kenyan hospitals. Conclusions: Although nurse-sensitive indicators are increasingly used in high-income countries to improve quality of care, there is a wide heterogeneity in the way indicators are defined and interpreted. Whilst some indicators were regarded as useful by a Kenyan expert panel, contextual differences prompted them to recommend additional new indicators to improve the evaluations of nursing care provision in Kenyan hospitals and potentially similar LMIC settings. Taken forward through implementation, refinement and adaptation, the proposed indicators could be more standardised and may provide a common base to establish national or regional professional learning networks with the common goal of achieving high-quality care through quality improvement and learning.",

Measurement of quality indicators is central to improvement efforts aimed to promote accountability in healthcare and professional practice. Quality indicators arise from the increasing demand for measures of quality across the healthcare continuum ranging from the community to tertiary level [2] . Nurses form the largest component of the health professional workforce and are recognised as essential to the delivery of safe and effective care. Understanding, measuring and reporting the quality of their work is, therefore, critical.",

Therefore, measuring what nurses do is important in maintaining standards, supporting nursing management and understanding outcomes and their variation that is linked to nursing. This requires development of sensitive, nursingspecific indicators [4] . Nurse-sensitive indicators (NSIs) have been identified and used by healthcare organisations and researchers to measure how much nurses contribute to patient outcomes [5, 6] . Although there are varied definitions of NSIs, the most comprehensive one defines NSIs as measures of things that are about nursing (structure), about what nurses do (process) or about outcomes that can be linked to structure and process issues. These measures must be quantifiably influenced by nursing personnel, but the relationship between these measures and nursing is not necessarily causal [7] .",

We also included The nursing advisory group was aimed at gaining a broad representation of the nursing community rather than a statistically representative group. We constituted panels from the nursing advisory group which met on two occasions for a full day of consultations. In the first meeting, a high-level group (n = 26) involved in policymaking drawn from the nursing directorate at the national level, training and regulatory institutions, and development partners met to review indicators identified through the scoping review with discussions being focused on a pre-identified list of possibly relevant indicators for LMIC selected by the authors. After a plenary session, smaller groups of at least five members, organised so that each group had broad representation in expertise and institutional affiliation, were formed to discuss indicators relevant to inpatient care for the five major inpatient disciplines (surgery, medicine, paediatrics, neonatal care and obstetrics and gynaecology). These discipline-specific groups were tasked with recommending a list of indicators for use in Kenya for the respective disciplines based on the literature in the form of the author's pre-identified list. On average, each group reviewed 10-15 of the pre-identified indicators. Additionally, group members were allowed to propose new indicators that were not captured in the literature but were deemed appropriate for the Kenyan context based on their experience and expertise which would then be considered by the entire panel. The discussions on indicator selection and prioritisation drew on the guidance from the National Quality Framework (NQF) [12] and focussed on (i) which indicators were relevant and important to these disciplines in representing the quality of nursing care, (ii) acceptability by the nursing profession that the indicator was an important aspect of their work and that its measurement would be a credible as an assessment of their work, (iii) availability of existing data sources that could support evaluations and (iv) where data were not routinely available, whether it would be feasible/realistic to introduce new data elements. After deliberations, each of the discipline-specific groups presented their propositions to the wider advisory group, and consensus on what indicators should finally be proposed was sought through discussion and show of hands.",

            "text": "Although there were several studies reporting NSIs, there were inconsistencies in the terminologies/definitions used to describe nursing quality indicators including nursesensitive indicators, nursing key performance indicators, nurse-sensitive quality indicators and nursing metrics [2, 5, 6, 20, 28] . In addition, definitions used for indicators varied by tool and data source despite the indicators aiming at assessing the same practice or outcome. For instance, nosocomial infections are considered in the aggregate in some studies whilst others described them by the system affected or resulting diseases such as urinary tract infections, pneumonia and upper respiratory infections. For example, some studies reported pneumonia and ventilator-acquired pneumonia as separate indicators (Table 4 ) [6, 29] . Consequently, there is considerable overlap in measurement approaches and limited standardisation across indicators undermining comparison between organisations or hospitals. Given the costs of measurement and the limited resources in LMICs, it will be important that a consistent and standard approach to indicator definition and measurement is developed to support the evaluation of nursing care in these settings. Using a stakeholder-driven approach, indicators identified from the literature were reviewed for relevance to a LMIC setting and where necessary initially adapted by discipline-specific groups (surgery, medicine, paediatrics, neonatal care and obstetrics and gynaecology). Of the 159 indicators identified, 70 were considered by researchers familiar with the local context and with quality measurement as potentially relevant to LMIC hospital settings. Of these, 31 were selected (and often adapted) by local stakeholders as likely to be useful for the Kenyan context. The reasons why indicators were excluded spanned different case-mix of patients and hospital settings including the availability of technology and infrastructure in HICs that were often lacking in LMICs. An additional 21 indicators that were not identified in the literature were recommended by stakeholders to measure aspects of nursing care provision that were considered a priority for the Kenyan context. These additional indicators spanned the domains of structure assessment (e.g. availability of resources to support infection prevention and control activities/practices) and process (e.g. monitoring of (Table 3) and spanned all the domains of patient identification (n = 1); effective communication (n = 9); safety of high-alert medication (n = 5); correct site, procedure and patient for surgery (n = 5); risk of health care-acquired infections (n = 19); and patient harms resulting from falls (n = 3). Developing measurements of the work done by nurses and a link to patient safety may be important in helping us understand the consequences of workforce shortages, and such measures could be helpful in accreditation programmes emerging in LMICs [30] [31] [32] whilst drawing lessons from global programmes such as the Joint Commission International (JCI) [33] . Progress has been made in defining, refining and testing NSIs in HICs with the development of nursing networks that use NSIs for quality improvement. Examples of these include the adoption and widespread use of the American Nurses Association National Database of Nursing Quality Indicators (NDNQI) in evaluating the nursing quality of care [34] and the creation of minimum datasets for nursing quality indicators [35] , but all these are limited to HICs. Exploring the commonly reported NSIs in HIC settings for transferability to LMIC with the premise that these are the most robust indicators based on their prevalent use, only 14 out of the 25 commonly reported indicators were adopted by stakeholders (Additional file 2). This suggests varying contexts and needs that should be considered when adapting recommendations from other settings. Therefore, approaches and progress made provide important lessons for LMICs as they consider indicators for adoption and operationalisation to avoid pitfalls that might have been experienced by HICs during the processes of setting up these systems. We hope by developing NSIs for a LMIC setting and using lessons on their implementation from HIC will help demonstrate the value, importance and broader contribution of nursing to high quality care both at local and wider levels whilst exploring what might constitute a minimum data set that allows quality monitoring and risk adjustment.",

This is probably because most of what they do is rarely measured, particularly in the LMIC health care settings where most measures of quality of care provided focus almost exclusively on more medical aspects of care [37, 38] . Therefore, measuring what nurses do and the quality of the care they deliver is essential in demonstrating the value of nurses and their work in promoting safety. These measurements will also be useful in highlighting the implications of workforce shortages and identifying opportunities for improving care whilst building improvement networks to promote nurse-led initiatives.",

            "text": "Our proposed set of indicators needs to be considered in light of the following limitations. Firstly, our review methods and stakeholder engagement differed from the more formal structured approaches of undertaking a systematic review and Delphi approach to indicator development. However, the process of developing and selection of indicators involved a wide range of stakeholders and were agreed upon through a consensus-based approach hence providing face validity. Although our final list of indicators (n = 52) have not formally been validated with a wider stakeholder group, we feel it provides an initial indicator set for testing in future studies of nursing care provision. We recognise that some indicators might be considered more critical than others such as those linked to patient outcomes (e.g. mortality) or due to their overall contribution to quality care. We adopted a simple approach giving each indicator equal weights that was deemed easiest for the diverse expert group to understand. The aim was to generate an initial set of indicators that can be further evaluated with the potential for introducing weighting based on further work. As such, this list is only indicative of what aspects of nursing should be measured and does not take into account the relative importance of various indicators. Secondly, anecdotal evidence and from the literature [39] [40] [41] [42] suggests that documentation of nursing is often fragmented, completed on several forms, sometimes in triplicate, and often completed in free text. This may undermine the application of the proposed indicators that are based on document review. As such, piloting of the proposed indicators in routine practice to evaluate their feasibility, reliability and construct validity will be important. To monitor and track the proposed NSIs may require better tools to support nursing care documentation, for instance, structured nursing notes. Similar efforts of codesigning structured nursing forms in Uganda and the United Kingdom have shown improvements in communication between nurses and other professionals whilst reducing time spent on documentation [43, 44] .",

The proposed NSIs for Kenya contribute to the dearth of information globally on NSI for monitoring quality of nursing care, particularly for LMICs. Further work on their validation through implementation, refinement and adaptation is required to generate a widely agreed set of standardised indicators. The latter provides an opportunity for LMICs to establish or join national or regional professional learning networks such as those in HICs [34, 45] or that are emerging in LMICs [46] that are showing success in achieving high-quality care through quality improvement and learning. Finally, measures of nursing quality might strengthen the voice of nurses in policy and practice and their position in planning and management roles where the nursing voice is often lacking. ",
