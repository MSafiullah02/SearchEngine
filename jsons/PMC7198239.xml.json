FLOSS promise significant shortcuts by reusing existing software components in commercial products [1, 4, 7, 13, 15, 16]. However, to avoid legal and other risks of using FLOSS in commercial products, such as license noncompliance, software vendors need to manage their FLOSS dependencies. Furthermore, this allows to track known security vulnerabilities introduced by such dependencies, as well as export restrictions and other important metadata.",

The architectural models used for this are often designed to satisfy a managerial perspective and neglect more fine-grained issues such as compliance information of bill of materials (BOM) details. As a consequence, there is a mismatch between an architectural model that supports the management of FLOSS dependencies and the models we found in industry. This leads to costly integration operations to ensure license compliance. Many companies develop own tooling to merge documented license information and generate more comprehensive reports about the use of FLOSS in their products. The lack of consistent concepts in the underlining models also causes manual intervention in the dependency management and license compliance processes, which slows down production. The vast, and still increasing, amount of the commercially used open source components additionally complicates the process of license compliance.",

We then extended our findings in a subsequent journal article [11] with a new round of qualitative data analysis using five additional interviews, which added the fifth category to the proposed theory focusing on the architecture model for software products. Among other requirements for tooling, it showed that companies develop their own tools to incorporate FLOSS governance relevant information with architectural information to manage software products. In this paper, we follow up on the topic of software dependency documentation in the context of FLOSS compliance, and focus on the challenges companies face in doing this. We did not identify any literature focusing on this specific topic, but found literature on FLOSS governance and compliance more broadly.",

The main challenges we found are:Data Gathering for the Compliance ProcessUsage of FLOSS in ProductsCustom ReportsSPDX SupportA Central System to Manage ProductsData Gathering for the Compliance Process. If a developer wants to use a FLOSS component it needs to be approved by the company\u2019s open source software office. FLOSS compliance processes are in place to manage the approval of a FLOSS component use. Fendt et al. [3] describe that a FLOSS management process inside their company consists of several phases. The first phase is the Request Phase, in which development teams initiate an approval request for a new FLOSS component they would like to use. The FLOSS compliance process of our case study company matches this first phase by requesting the use of a FLOSS component. The usage of only approved FLOSS components helps to avoid legal compliance risks introduced by unknown components. In our previous studies about industry requirements on FLOSS governance and compliance tools, we found that companies want to have an automated process of adding new FLOSS components and their metadata into a common architectural model [11], captured in the following requirement:\u201cThe tool should allow automated adding of FLOSS components and their metadata into the repository using the product architecture model\u201d \u2013 Requirement 5.b. [11]But in reality, users of FLOSS components often have to provide information about a component by hand. This manual step of collecting information is time-consuming and can slow down the whole approval process. The typical required information for an approval decision includes:Licenses and copyright informationProject references, like the homepage URLUploaded source code and binaries, or provide location to download themClarification if component include cryptographic functionalitiesExport Control Classification Number (ECCN)4\nDoes the component require a specific runtime, like Java Runtime Environment (JRE)\n",

One interview partner reported that they used a central system to manage their products in which they could incorporate all the information needed for reports and license compliance artifacts. While our interview partner saw high value in having a central system, it did not circumvent all the challenges of license compliance. For example, they reported that relationships between components of a product were represented only as simple dependencies. This simplification produced a high-level view on the composition of a product, which was not enough to generate precise reports on the full product architecture.\u201c[A central system] is for me not enough [...] we have all the data but the relations between things [are insufficient]\u201d \u2013 Product managerAs described before, data gathering from different tools and systems to feed the central system tends to be error-prone.

Because the architecture documentation was initially not designed with compliance information in mind, it is difficult to deal with FLOSS in products.

Another effect is that the documentation of a product does not represent the actual shipped product. An example of such a divergence is when a product\u2019s feature depends on the purchased product key, like a home vs a professional version of a product. While the product is still the same, the shipped version of the product differs in accessible components.
