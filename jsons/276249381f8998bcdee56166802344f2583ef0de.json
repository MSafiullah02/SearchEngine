Many applications of social media analytics, from pandemic prediction to earthquake response, require an in-depth understanding of how these patterns change when human encounter unfamiliar conditions. In this paper, we select two earthquakes in China as the social context in Sina-Weibo (or Weibo for short), the largest Chinese microblog site. After proposing a formalized Weibo information flow model to represent the information spread on Weibo, we study the information spread from three main perspectives: individual characteristics, the types of social relationships between interactive participants, and the topology of real interaction networks. The quantitative analyses draw the following conclusions. First, the shadow of Dunbar's number is evident in the \"declared friends/followers\" distributions, and the number of each participant's friends/followers who also participated in the earthquake information dissemination show the typical powerlaw distribution, indicating a rich-gets-richer phenomenon. Second, an individual's number of followers is the most critical factor in user influence. Strangers are very important forces for disseminating real-time news after an earthquake. Third, two types of real interaction networks share the scale-free and small-world property, but with a looser organizational structure. In addition, correlations between different influence groups indicate that when compared with other online social media, the discussion on Weibo is mainly dominated and influenced by verified users.",

However, many applications, from pandemic prediction to earthquake response, require an understanding of how these patterns change when human encounter unfamiliar conditions [17] , [18] . Especially for China, who suffered from frequent natural disasters, the understanding of how the behaviors of hundreds of millions of Web users change is very important. The empirical study of the human flesh search (HFS) [19] , [20] , for one, provided quantitative insights into these collective responses of Web users in China. Inspired by previous research on Web users collective responses, we choose two empirical cases in China-Yi'liang (2012) and Ya'an earthquakes (2013) . What makes it additionally useful is that many densely populated areas in mainland China, such as Sichuan, Fujian, and so on, are frequent earthquake areas and often suffered severe damage from earthquakes.",

However, after further study, a group of researchers represented by Huberman et al. [28] found that social interactions within Twitter cannot be inferred directly from a declared relationship set of friends and followers: many users interact with few other people in their declared relationship network [28] [29] [30] [31] . The key problem is that the structure of the underlying interaction network is not visible and must be inferred from the flow of information between individuals, which poses a serious challenge to our efforts to understand how the structure of the network affects social dynamics and the spread of information [32] . Take the tweet reposting connection shown in Fig. 1 underlying interaction network: 1) user-D has four followers, B, C, F, and E, but just C and F repost the message created by D; 2) user-F reposts the tweet created by user-D through the intermediary-C; 3) user-C participates more than once; and 4) the tweet created by user-D is also reposted by user-H who does not have the relationship of friend or follower with user-D.",

Also for users whose message are reposted, does the reposting all take place solely among their followers? Are there any differences in information diffusion patterns before and after the earthquake? 4) Compared with early Web2.0 online communications, does the Sina-Weibo platform have unique features that include social and information dissemination functions? 5) Are there any correlations between the type of interacted user relationships and the topological feature of user networks? The organization of this paper is as follows. Section III presents the main body of this paper. We first introduce the data set and give a formal definition of the WIF model in Section II. Section III consists of three subsections. Section III-A includes the empirical results of eight individual attributes: the configured language of a personal page, gender, location, the number of followers, the number of friends, the number of posted tweets, the number being reposted, and the correlation among three user rankings. Section III-B analyzes the proportion of each type of user relationship between interacted users and discusses the differences in reposting patterns of each interacted user group by the user relationships. Section III-C uses social network analysis to unveil the topological properties of two types of underlying interaction networks, which are extracted by the WIF model, and analyze the correlation between influential user groups of two networks. Section IV closes this paper with remarks for future work.",

Our measurement of WU.gender, WU.lang, and WU.pNum shows: 1) there is a roughly equal proportion of males and females among participant users; 2) users living in the Chinese Mainland, Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan are the force that made the tweet peak instantaneously, and the reason of the phenomena mainly come from the locality of Sina-Weibo; and 3) there are a few foreign users participating to post or repost related tweets, but nearly all of them live in China. Fig. 4 shows the geographic distribution of participant users before and after the earthquake. During the aftermath in Yi'liang which was hit by a 5.7-magnitude earthquake on September 7, 2012, Fig. 4 (b) shows that Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangdong topped the rank in the number of participant users and the proportion of active users located in these three areas is 27.83%, these three cities are the political center, the financial center, and the largest province in the economy, respectively. Only 3.5% of active users are located in the local province (Yunnan). In cases prior to the earthquake, there is too little data to analyze unfortunately, probably because Yi'liang is a very remote country in Yunnan province. Therefore, we replaced it with Ya'an which is a popular tourist destination (in the same way later). Then, we found in Fig. 4 (a) hat local province (Sichuan) ranked first in the number of active users posting Ya'an common topics, with a share of 26.33%, at the same time the sum of shares in Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangdong still reaches 29.25%.",

That is, human communities are much larger than those of other primates and hence require more time to be devoted to social maintenance activities. However, there is an upper limit on the amount of time that can be dedicated to social demands, so this sets an upper limit on social group size [41] , [42] . It is known that humans have the cognitive capacity to maintain about 150 stable social relationships. With the advent of different types of super social networking services developing one after another, people have once again picked up the topic for discussion [43] , [44] . Many researchers have investigated how tools, such as Facebook and Twitter, have changed our capacity to handle social connections using the empirical study [45] [46] [47] . Here, Fig. 5(a) and (b) also shows the shadow of Dunbar's number on Sina-Weibo.",

First, \"3.1 Analysis of user characteristics\" has already shown that very few Weibo-big-Vs are able to attract wide attention; in other words, an overwhelming majority of Weibo users play the role of followers. From the dramatic contrast between proportions of RR t ype=I and RR t ype=I I I , Sina-Weibo seems like a natural platform to worship idols. Second, given the dramatic contrast among the proportions of RR t ype=I I and RR t ype=I I I or RR t ype=I V , Weibo users pay more attention to receiving interesting information than making friends. Maybe this is what makes Weibo different from other online social platforms. Third, followers are indeed the major driving force for the Weibo information spread, but at the same time, the reports from strangers are equally crucial. Particularly in some public emergencies, strangers are likely to be in the vanguard of discussing and distributing news in real time. So, from the point of view of information distribution, in addition to the followers' count of a user, it is also important to examine whether the tweet is selected as a hot message used to push to all other users (see http://hot.weibo.com/).",

The nature underlying power-law distribution is uneven, and the higher a slope value is, the more severe the imbalance gets. Corresponding to the situation here, it means that these users participating RR t ype=I V maintain the same interaction pattern with users of ordinary online social forums. However, there might be a serious structural imbalance in the interactions of RR t ype=I , RR t ype=I I , RR t ype=I I I , and RR t ype=V , which may be the reason why Weibo is so different, churning out a string of \"Weibo-big-Vs\"-Weibo users with mass followings and whose identities have been verified by Sina. These features have to do with social role partitioning [ Fig. 3(a) ] and the rolebased push services (Fig. 7) on Sina-Weibo.",

Additionally, some other researchers have also found that social interaction existed among various types of users, far more than among acquaintances [54] . From the perspective of network topology, beyond the network density, are there any differences in other topological properties? In addition, what are the key factors behind user influence? To answer these questions, first, a method is introduced to extract the hidden interaction network from the friends and followers network on the basis of the WIF model.

For the scale-free property in a social network, the research team of Albert-L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Barab\u00e1s holds that it is a consequence of a decision-based queuing process: when individuals execute tasks based on some perceived priority, there will be heavy tail phenomenon [55] . We do not rule out the possibility, because the number being reposted is indeed an important factor for a tweet in a real-time-based push service shown in Fig. 7(c) . However, one thing is certain: without the strong appeal of hub users in either FRCN or SRCN, few messages could get widespread.",

However, the values of S and d in Table III and the result in Fig. 13(g) and (h) both shows that the avg.D has not affected the social distance, i.e., Weibo information can always flow from one user to another through a small number of hops. With the SRCN, for example, each user has less than three adjacent users on average, but the typical distance between randomly chosen users still remains fewer than nine hops. Another finding about FRCN and SRCN is that the shortest paths of FRCN behave according to the negative binomial distribution.",

In addition, the two curves in Fig. 14(b) have a similar level, it can be observed that the two influential groups in FRCN and SRCN have at least one thing in common: both have a massive following of fans.

In fact, Fig. 8 has given us some intuition that there is probably a serious structural imbalance between the \"declared\" relationship network and the real interaction network [57] [58] [59] .
