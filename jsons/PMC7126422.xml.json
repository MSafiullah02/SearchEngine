Ions and small molecules, such as amino acids and sugars, can traverse the plasma membrane through membrane channels. Macromolecules and larger structures enter cells by endocytosis, which is defined as the uptake by invagination and pinching-off of portions of the plasma membrane containing lipids and membrane proteins, extracellular ligands and/or soluble molecules 1, 2, 3. Several types of endocytosis have been described, differing in the size of the endocytic vesicle, the nature of the cargo and the mechanism of vesicle formation. They include phagocytosis, macropinocytosis, clathrin-mediated endocytosis, caveolin-mediated endocytosis and clathrin- and caveolin-independent endocytosis [1].",

            "text": "Clathrin-mediated endocytosis is the major process by which transmembrane proteins are internalized from the plasma membrane. It starts at the so-called coated pits, which are formed by the assembly of clathrin on the cytoplasmic side of the plasma membrane. Transmembrane proteins are selectively recruited to these coated pits by binding to clathrin adaptors or other coat-associated proteins. The coated pit then pinches off from the membrane and forms a coated vesicle inside the cell [4]. Clathrin in coated vesicles is structured as a triskelion, formed by three heavy (192 kDa) and three light (25\u201329 kDa) chains that bind to each other in a polyhedral lattice [5]. Data from in vitro reconstitution studies and models of clathrin triskelion suggest that clathrin can support the entry of vesicles with a maximal diameter of 120 nm 6, 7, 8. This led to the dogma that particles with a diameter larger that 120 nm cannot enter cells by clathrin-mediated endocytosis [1]. In addition to enabling the entry of macromolecules (e.g. low density lipoprotein, \u03b12 macroglobulin or growth factor receptors), clathrin-mediated endocytosis is a well documented portal of entry for a large number of viruses (e.g. influenza viruses, adenoviruses, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), reoviruses, Semliki forest virus, Ebola virus, SARS coronavirus or hepatitis B and C viruses) to invade host cells 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.",

            "text": "Invasive bacteria, like viruses, induce their own uptake by non-phagocytic host cells. In this intracellular niche, bacteria are protected from hostile events occurring in the extracellular environment, such as complement deposition or antibody binding. They can then multiply and invade neighbouring cells after direct cell-to-cell spread or after cell lysis. Invasive bacteria can be separated into two well-differentiated groups on the basis of their entry mechanisms, the \u2018zipper\u2019 and the \u2018trigger\u2019 mechanisms (Box 1\n). The entry of Listeria monocytogenes, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis and other pathogenic bacteria that invade host cells by the zipper mechanism is triggered by the interactions between bacterial surface-exposed proteins and cellular receptors. For example, the Listeria proteins InlA and InlB interact with cellular E-cadherin (an adhesion protein) and Met (also known as hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) receptor), respectively, and Yersinia invasin binds to \u03b21-integrins. These interactions induce signalling cascades that result in the activation of the actin cytoskeleton and relatively small membrane extensions that zip around the bacterium and engulf it [15]. Salmonella and Shigella are the paradigms of bacteria that use the second mechanism of entry, the trigger mechanism. Bacteria in this group actively inject effectors into the host cytoplasm using a specialized secretory apparatus, the type III secretion system. Some of these bacterial effectors modulate the actin cytoskeleton, producing massive polymerization of actin and membrane ruffling. This results in the formation of pseudopods loosely attached to bacteria, that enable bacterial internalization in a process similar to macropinocytosis 15, 16. The two entry pathways share a requirement for actin polymerization.Box 1The zipper and trigger modelsThe zipper mechanism\nListeria (Figure Ia, top), Neisseria and Yersinia are examples of bacteria that enter using the zipper mechanism. These bacteria express proteins on their surfaces that interact with cellular receptors, initiating signalling cascades that result in close apposition of the cellular membrane around the entering bacteria (Figure 1a, bottom). Actin polymerization and modest membrane extensions finally lead to bacterial internalization. For example, the listerial protein InlB interacts with Met, promoting Met auto-phosphorylation, the recruitment of the protein adaptors Gab1, Cbl and Shc and activation phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) and the small GTPase Rac, which in turn promotes actin polymerization through the actin-binding Arp2/3 and Wave complexes. This interaction of InlB with Met also promotes ubiquitination of the receptor and the recruitment of the clathrin-dependent endocytic machinery, including clathrin and dynamin, to the bacterial entry site. Finally, bacteria are endocytosed in a clathrin-coated vesicle. It is possible that actin polymerization is also associated with the endocytic machinery in an Arp2/3-independent manner, as it has been shown that the actin-binding protein cortactin and CD2AP are important for Listeria internalization.The trigger mechanism\nShigella (Figure Ib, top) and Salmonella are the best-studied examples of bacteria entering cells using the trigger mechanism. These bacteria bypass the necessity to bind to a cellular receptor and use type III secretion systems to inject protein effectors that interact with the actin cytoskeleton. Type III secretion systems are complex protein machineries that enable the secretion of bacterial effectors directly from the bacterial cytoplasm into the cellular cytosol. The injected bacterial effectors promote massive actin polymerization and formation of macropinocytic membrane extensions loosely attached to the bacteria, and which eventually lead to bacterial internalization. For example, the Shigella protein IpaC triggers actin polymerization directly or in a manner dependent on the small GTPases Cdc42 and Rac. The Shigella effector VirA, which binds to tubulin hetero-oligomers and inhibits microtubule formation, can indirectly promote actin polymerization. Shigella infection also promotes the activation of the kinases Abl and Arg and phosphorylation of the adaptor protein Crk, which can activate Cdc42 and Rac in a process similar to that observed in filopodia formation. Another Shigella effector, IpgD, hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol (4,5)bisphosphate (PIP2) to phosphatidylinositol (5) phosphate (PIP) and disconnects cortical actin from the membrane [74].",

            "text": "For many years, drugs that interfere with the actin cytoskeleton (e. g. cytochalasin D) have been used as tools to distinguish between clathrin-dependent endocytosis and phagocytosis. It was generally thought that clathrin-mediated endocytosis was actin-independent (see, for example, Ref. [17]). As bacteria require the participation of the actin cytoskeleton to enter into host cells 15, 16, and as the size of the vesicle harbouring a bacterium far exceeds the maximal size expected for a clathrin-coated vesicle, the hypothesis was that bacteria enter into non-phagocytic cells by phagocytic-like mechanisms. However, receptors used by zippering bacteria to enter into cells (e.g. Met, E-cadherin and integrins) can be endocytosed by a clathrin-dependent mechanism, and an increasing number of articles start to point to the necessary role of actin cytoskeleton in clathrin-mediated endocytosis 3, 18, 19. The requirement of the actin cytoskeleton was therefore not incompatible with the participation of clathrin-dependent endocytosis in bacterial entry. Challenging the dogma, it has been shown that Listeria invade non-epithelial cells by hijacking the clathrin-dependent endocytic machinery. There are also data implicating clathrin-mediated uptake for several other bacteria. Here, we discuss the possible role of clathrin-mediated endocytosis in bacterial entry.",

L. monocytogenes can cross the intestinal, blood\u2013brain and placental barriers. L monocytogenes is a facultative intracellular pathogen and can invade and replicate in epithelial cells and macrophages 15, 20. As mentioned earlier, two bacterial proteins involved in entry have been described: InlA, which interacts with E-cadherin on epithelial cells, and InlB, a surface protein that enables L. monocytogenes to enter into most non-phagocytic cells by interaction with its cellular receptor Met. Met belongs to the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) family and is involved in diverse cellular functions, such as scattering, invasion, proliferation, morphogenesis and angiogenesis. It is also implicated in a large number of human tumours, correlating closely with metastasis and poor prognosis 21, 22. These tumorigenic activities occur when Met is overexpressed or when Met signalling after ligand (HGF) binding is not down-regulated [23]. The normal way used by cells to stop signalling downstream of Met and other RTKs is the ligand-dependent endocytosis and subsequent degradation of the activated receptor 21, 23.",

As observed by immunofluorescence, clathrin and dynamin, the major proteins involved in clathrin-dependent endocytosis [1], localize at bacterial entry sites (Figure 1\nand see the supplementary material online) [25]. Cbl, the ubiquitin ligase responsible for ubiquitination and subsequent endocytosis of Met and other growth factors 26, 27, 28, 29, also localizes at bacterial entry sites [25]. The possible role in bacterial entry of the major proteins involved in the clathrin-dependent endocytosis of growth factor receptors, including clathrin heavy chain, dynamin and Cbl, was tested by small interfering RNA (siRNA), which resulted in great reduction in bacterial entry [25]. Moreover, the relevance of other components of the endocytic machinery, such as growth factor receptor-binding protein (Grb2), epidermal growth factor pathway substrate 15 (eps15), Cbl-interacting protein of 85 kDa (CIN85) and CD2 associated protein (CD2AP), all of which are proteins necessary for ligand-induced endocytosis of receptor tyrosine kinases 2, 19, 30, 31 during bacterial entry was shown by siRNA knock-down. Decreased expression of these proteins strongly inhibited L. monocytogenes entry [25], demonstrating a major role of the clathrin-dependent endocytic machinery during L. monocytogenes infections.",

Electron microscopy (EM) studies show that invasion of epithelial cells by E. coli inv+ occurs through electron dense structures resembling clathrin-coated vesicles [34]. In addition, potassium depletion, which has been shown to inhibit clathrin-mediated endocytosis [35], also inhibits bacterial entry [34]. Moreover, microinjection into host cells of antibodies against clathrin or AP2 (the major clathrin adaptor in the plasma membrane [36]) also inhibits bacterial entry [34].

EM studies show that Chlamydia psittaci and Chlamydia trachomatis enter epithelial cells using clathrin-coated pits 55, 56, 57. In these studies, the infective forms of Chlamydia, called elementary bodies, were observed at coated pits and coated vesicles, and anti-clathrin immunostaining indicated the presence of clathrin at the bacterial entry sites [56]. However, EM studies of Chlamydia invasion failed to find clathrin-coated pits associated with entry of the bacterium, and monodansylcadaverine had no effect on invasion [58]. Moreover, in cells expressing mutants of dynamin (dynamin I K44A) and of Eps15 (Eps15 \u039495\u2013295) [59], which inhibit clathrin-dependent endocytosis 60, 61, the entry of C. trachomatis remained unaffected [59], suggesting a clathrin-independent entry. These conflicting reports on the role of clathrin-dependent endocytosis suggest that Neisseria and Chlamydia could use different and alternative entry pathways; some of these could be clathrin-dependent and some not, probably depending on the receptor engaged.",
