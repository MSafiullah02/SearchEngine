Therefore, the whole immunoglobulin molecule contains 1320\u20131540 amino acid residues (Edelman, 1991). The L and H polypeptides are positioned in such way that V domains and C domains of L chains are in parallel with their counterpart of the H chain. Each HL monomer contains one antigen-binding site. Inter-chain disulfide bonds and non-covalent interactions associate each L chain with one H chain and the two H chains with the each other (Padlan, 1994, Ramsland and Farrugia, 2002).",

L chains contain two domains, VL and CL, whereas the H chains have four to five domains, VH1, CH1, CH2, CH3 (or CH4). In the tetrameric Ig molecule, H2L2, there are a total of 12\u201314 domains: 4V domains and 8\u201310C domains. Pairing of one entire L chain (LVLC) with the first domain of the H chain (HVHC1) results in (LVLC) (HVHC1), called Fab, while pairing CH2 and CH3 from the two H chains results in the formation of (CH2 CH3) (CH2 CH3), called Fc portion (Padlan, 1994, Ramsland and Farrugia, 2002). In most Igs there are, therefore, two Fabs and one Fc. The two Fab regions join the Fc region to form the Y-like structure at the hinge region. This region is rich in proline residues, providing flexibility to this region (Saphire et al., 2002). Sites of carbohydrate attachments and regions for interactions with the complement component, C1, are located within the CH2 domain of Igs with three CH domains, or in the CH3 domain of the Igs with four CH domains (Davies and Metzger, 1983, Bengten et al., 2000) (Fig. 1A).",

After their V-C gene is rearranged in B cells, IgY is continually synthesized, secreted into the blood and transferred to the egg yolk, where it is accumulated (Warr et al., 1995). IgY is produced by hens to provide their offspring with an effective humoral immunity against the commonest avian pathogens until full maturation of their own immune system. In chickens, only three immunoglobulins classes have been well identified, IgM, IgA and IgY, and suggested but not yet proven are IgD and IgE (Chen et al., 1982, Burns and Maxwell, 1981). IgY (167,250 kDa), although prevalent in circulating blood (5\u20137 mg/ml of serum) and in egg yolk (100 mg/egg yolk), is also found in duodenal contents, tracheal secretions and in seminal fluid (Leslie and Clem, 1969).",

Effective production of antibodies for the existent antigenic repertoire requires rearrangement of the different immunoglobulin protein segments (Tonegawa, 1981, Alt et al., 1987). In mammalian species, such as mouse and human, the presence in the genome of multiple functional V (variable), D (diversity) and J (joining) segments ensures rearrangement to form VDJH and VJL complexes, which encodes VH and VL domains, respectively for the heavy (H) and light (L) chains of the Ig molecule. For a Ig rearranged functional antibody molecule, some V segments are randomly selected to form the VLJ and VHJ(D) DNA segments (Fig. 2\n). The estimated rearranging segment numbers in mammalian Ig loci are:Mouse:VH, 100\u2013200; VL kappa, 250\u2013300; VL lambda, 3; D, 27 exclusively for heavy chain; J, 4 for both chains.Human:VH, 130; VL kappa, 75; VL lambda 75; D, 15 exclusively for heavy chain; J, 6 for heavy chain; 5 and 7 for the light kappa and lambda chains, respectively.\n",

Although somatic mutations occur in low frequency in all dividing cells, their frequency is higher in B cells at a rate of 103 mutations per nucleotide pair per cell division. This high rate of point mutation, approximately one million times higher than in other cells, is restricted to the rearranged Ig locus. Point mutations, besides assure such enormous increase in the antibody repertoire is responsible for the emergence of immunoglobulins with high affinity for their specific antigens. In mammalian the antibody diversity can be also generated through a \u201cmulti-V(D)J\u201d mechanism. In sheep in which the Ig locus contains a limited number of different VJL rearrangements, diversity is further created by the introduction of multiple point mutations into the rearranged segments (Reynaud et al., 1991, Weill et al., 1995) (Fig. 2).",

The supernatant containing the IgY is collected by centrifugation (10,000 \u00d7 \ng at 4 \u00b0C for 30 min), and the temperature adjusted to 20 \u00b0C and subjected to 29% ammonium sulfate. Precipitate proteins are recovered by centrifuging the solution (10,000 \u00d7 \ng at 4 \u00b0C for 30 min), re-dissolving in 0.15 M NaCl and dialyzing against this same solution. The material can be further purified by Q-Sepharose Fast Flow chromatography to remove non-immunoglobulin proteins. The resulting IgY preparations are re-dissolved in 0.15 M NaCl and dialyzed against this same solution. When specific purified IgY antibodies are desired, immune-affinity chromatography can be used. The antibodies are applied, at neutral pH, to a column prepared with a matrix, where the antigen of interest is bound. After washing with isotonic phosphate-saline, pH 7.2, to remove non-specific antibodies, specific bound IgY antibodies are eluted with 0.1 M glycine, pH 2.2\u20132.8 (Akita and Nakai, 1992, Kim et al., 1999, Almeida et al., 1998, Almeida et al., 2003, Almeida et al., 2008).",

Therefore, to obtain immunoreagents containing antibody titers against mammalian antigens, chickens are better and cheaper than mammals (Shimitzu et al., 1994, Olovsson and Larsson, 1993, Svendsen and Hau, 1996, Ericka, 1999, Larsson et al., 1999). Furthermore, chicken antibodies recognize more epitopes when mammalian proteins are used as antigens, than the corresponding mammalian antibodies (Svendsen and Hau, 1996, Hadge and Anbrosuius, 1984, Horton et al., 1984, Song et al., 1985). The absence of immunological cross-reactivity between chicken IgY and mammalian IgG (Hadge and Anbrosuius, 1984), determined by the evolutionary distance, reinforces the advantages of using IgY over IgG as the first antibody in some types of immunological reactions. For instance, in immunohistochemical analysis the usually common cross-reactions observed between tissue IgG and epitopes, shared by the primary antibody and recognized by the secondary mammalian antibody, are not observed when IgY is used as the secondary antibody (Larsson and Lindahl, 1993). Chicken antibodies exhibit high avidity (109\n L/mol) even after the first immunization. In order to reach similar avidity values (1010\n L/mol), sheep must receive four boosters (Wooley and Landon, 1995).",

Four weeks after the bacterial challenge, hens were given daily a supplemented feed of 15% (w/w) of either non-immunized egg yolk powder or immunized egg yolk powder for 28 days. Oral administration of both powders resulted in a rapid decrease in the number of S. enteritidis in faeces and an elimination of the organism after 2 weeks of feeding (Brady et al., 2002, Sugita-Konishi et al., 2000).",

Egg yolk powder, at a concentration of close to 5% (w/w) was able to eliminate S. e. typhimurium and significantly reduce the bacterial shedding after 2 weeks of feeding. Higher concentrations (7.5%, w/w) of egg yolk powder from non-immune hens were also able to reduce the colonization of C. jejuni and E. coli. Therefore, oral administration of non-immunized egg yolk powder can reduce colonization of the intestinal tract, indicating that the egg yolk may contain additional anti-infectious factors, besides IgY.",

Fifteen milliliters off yolk-containing antibody were mixed with 3.84 ml of drinking water on day one continuing for duration of the experiment. In comparison to control animals, who did not receive antibodies, the treated animals had significantly lower faecal shedding (0% versus 14%) and lower cecal concentrations of S. enteritidis (0.27 log10\n CFU versus 3.98 log10\n CFU).
