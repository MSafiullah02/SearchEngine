These films were also exported -there is a version of at least one Kleist film in which the German text boards have been replaced by English translations (these films were all silent) -but most have unfortunately since been lost. Synopses of several of their EL films were published in a short-lived specialist journal, the semi-annual Programme der medizinischen Filmwoche (the third and final volume [1926/27] appeared under the title Medizin und Film), published in Berlin by the Unterrichts-Film-Gesellschaft ('Educational Film Society'):",

            "text": "\u2022 'Rigidity (parkinsonism) in encephalitis epidemica'; \u2022 'Encephalitis epidemica II': postural and gait abnormalities, oculogyric crises and blinking crises, antagonist muscular tremor in chronic EL; as well as myoclonus and tics in acute EL; \u2022 'Encephalitis epidemica III': rigidity combined with psychologic negativism. 2 The same authors also published several films on PD and various aspects of catatonia, and Herz also published a volume on his video analysis of involuntary extrapyramidal movements that included several stills from their EL films; 3 Kleist prepared at least one further EL film during the late 1930s. 4 Herz departed Germany during the 1930s, but continued to make neurologic films at Columbia University in New York, and in 1946 published (together with Tracy Putnam) an illustrated overview of this work, Motor disorders in nervous diseases. A particularly interesting film of acute EL, in which the hysteria-like aspect of the presentation was noted, was also reported by Friedrich Lewy in Medizin und Film, while Gustav Machol (Charit\u00e9, Berlin) presented a 20-year-old man who had suffered oculogyric crises for the past five years, having contracted EL as a 12-year-old. Kurt Albrecht, from the same clinic, depicted both the loss of balance experienced by an EL patient when their eyes were closed, as well as curious rhythmic shifting between feet when standing, but not when sitting or lying down. 5 Several other German clinics also prepared films of EL patients; a series concerned with this disease, for example, was produced by Kraepelin in Munich, whereby the time and expense required had motivated a co-operation agreement with the Neue Kinematographische Gesellschaft. 6 Alexander Westphal (Bonn) was particularly interested in the possibilities of cinematographic analysis of movement disorders, and his film of nine chronic EL patients is still extant. 7 Oculogyric crises were filmed by several authors, including Stern, 8 while Johannes Kirchhof produced several short films at the Charit\u00e9 in 1939. 9 Interesting film records were also produced in France, including clips of EL at the Vaucluse colony, and another concerning subcortical crises. 10 In the USA, Simon Philip Goodhart and Frederick Tilney (Columbia University) similarly recognized the value of film for the analysis of movement disorders, and presented two film reels of 1,000 feet each (c. 16 minutes silent) to a meeting of the American Neurological Association in 1922. The first depicted movement disorders in recognized neurologic syndromes, the second those of EL. The latter included one case that resembled Sydenham chorea, and another that encompassed a combination of symptoms unknown in other any disease: athetotic limb motions together with tic-like movements of the left sterno-cleido-mastoid and rhythmic oscillations of head and trunk. In another case, the tics and other early involuntary movements had been abruptly displaced a year later by marked parkinsonism that gave the impression the patient had aged by ten years. Other features depicted in the film included unusual chewing movements, dystonia, disturbed posture and gait, cranial nerve symptoms, abdominal myoclonus, and, most interestingly a \"peculiar oculo-encephalogyric movement\", probably the first American reference to oculogyric crises and the earliest film recording of this phenomenon. 11 Goodhart and Benjamin Harris Balser included 19 minutes of footage of various aspects of acute and chronic EL (22 cases) in the 1944 Neurological cinematographic atlas (including the self-mutilation cases discussed on p. 426 of this volume), providing an invaluable record of the disease. 12 Other such films have, unfortunately, been lost, although it is likely that many are awaiting rediscovery in archives or other storage facilities. In 1998, for example, Virgilio Evidente and colleagues (Mayo Clinic, Rochester) published a collection of clips made between 1920 and 1930, 13 while films prepared by Kinnier Wilson during the 1920s at Queen Square in London have come to light more recently, including segments involving three chronic EL patients; 14 a film produced by Rosenow has also been published. 15 Joel Vilensky and colleagues published a valuable compilation of film clips from various (mostly American) sources, including the Goodhart-Tilney films in 2006. 16 Unpublished photographs of EL patients also occasionally re-surface. 17 Encephalitis lethargica in non-medical literature and film EL was a regular subject for reports in the newspapers and magazines of the 1920s. Unsurprisingly, most attention was initially directed to the threat to life posed by the disorder, with the quality of the coverage depending upon the newspaper style; as one physician commented in the British Journal of Nursing, it is \"the custom in a certain section of the lay press to announce under more or less sensational headlines the advent of a new disease \u2026 this honour is conceded, for the most part, only to those conditions from which something in the nature of a scare can be elicited.\" 18 As it became clear, however, that the EL epidemic was not to assume the scale of influenza, interest switched to accounts of prodigious or abrupt sleep (particularly in the United States), and of discussions of the social consequences of post-EL delinquency. EL was known well enough by the average citizen to be feared when it struck close to home, but it did not occur frequently enough to be a source of major consternation or personal concern. This sentiment was particularly widespread until the mid-1920s, before the realization dawned that 'recovery' from acute EL almost invariably disintegrated into lifelong incapacity at some unforeseeable point in the future.",

Giddings, Superintendent of the hospital, explained the theory that musical sound waves of varying length stimulated certain nerve centres that were lying inactive. 21 Prominent people suffering EL were also worthy of attention, such as Jane Morgan, the wife of American banker John Pierpont Morgan Jr who, two years after his wife's death, donated $200,000 (today: c. $2.75 million) to fund a 48-bed department for the investigation of EL at the new Neurological Institute; 22 and British entomologist and banker Charles Rothschild, who committed suicide in 1923 to escape the chronic effects of the disease he apparently contracted in 1916 or 1917. 23 Others purported to have contracted EL included the astrophysicist and mathematician Edward Arthur Milne (1896 Milne ( -1950 , the Italian poet Emanuel Carnevali , and the rapist Caryl Chessman . 24 The creator of Gormenghast, Mervyn Peake , is also often noted as having contracted EL as a child in China, but there is nothing in his biography to support this diagnosis. 25 Of particular interest for the history of neurology is the suggestion that the promising young Sydney professor of anatomy, John Irvine Hunter (1898-1924) and the orthopedic surgeon Norman Royle (1888-1944) contracted EL in New York in late 1924 during a tour of the USA and the UK to promote their sympathectomy technique for the amelioration of spasticity. Both Australians fell ill during this journey, and Hunter died shortly afterwards in England (officially of enteric fever = typhoid); Royle survived, but in 1930 presented initial signs of post-encephalitic parkinsonism (PEP). Hunter's premature death was regarded as a major tragedy; Australian \u00e9migr\u00e9 Grafton Elliot Smith remarked that had \"he lived, he might have become the foremost man of science of the age.\" 26 The change in demeanor exhibited by United States President Woodrow Wilson during his second sojourn in Paris has been attributed to his contracting EL during the Versailles peace treaty negotiations, 27 but this speculation is not supported by reports of any specific symptoms; Wilson had, in any case, fallen ill en route to Paris, and the intransigence of his European colleagues and other health problems (including vascular disease, a recent car accident and severe influenza) sufficiently explain the decline in vigor of the 63-year-old president.",

            "text": "The most prominent supposed EL sufferer was undoubtedly Adolf Hitler (1889-1945), and there is a rich literature on this question that obviates the need for a detailed discussion here. A range of symptoms that support the diagnosis are well documented on film and in the accounts of those who had close contact with him: not only the left hand tremor so evident in unedited film clips from 1945, but also increasing rigidity, micrographia, palilalia, obsessive-compulsiveness and iterative motor signs, as well as possible oculogyric crises. It is also known that the many medications he was taking during the Second World War included those normally prescribed in Germany for PEP, including the Bulgarian treatment, Homburg 680 (an alkaloid preparation based on the Bulgarian preparation), and harmine, but there could conceivably also have been employed to treat idiopathic parkinsonism. Johann Recktenwald (1882-1964), director of the Andernach asylum during the period in which it participated in the sterilization and killing of mentally ill patients, proposed in his detailed 1963 study that Hitler had suffered PEP, but dated the acute illness to 1900, the year Hitler's brother had died of measles; Dutch author P. J. Stolk (Portuugaal) held 1918 as the more likely initiation date, but otherwise supported Recktenwald's position. The PEP hypothesis was more recently supported by American neurologist Abraham Liebermann on the basis of film documentation of a deterioration in Hitler's parkinsonian symptoms between 1933 and 1945; Liebermann identified the first PEP symptoms in 1933 footage. A thorough analysis of the available film material led Cologne neurologist Ellen Gibbels to the opposite conclusion, that Hitler suffered idiopathic Parkinson disease (PD). The controversy has attracted no attention in the past ten years, and it remains unresolved. 29 Apart from indirect allusions to the visual and psychological semeiology of EL in the German expressionist film Das Cabinet des Dr. Caligari (1920), references to EL in literary settings were surprisingly infrequent. The most prominent was in Agatha Christie's 1930 mystery The murder at the vicarage, in which the young curate Ronald Hawes had suffered EL a year prior to the events described in the novel, as related by Dr Haydock in his conversation with the vicar:",

The lethargy of EL, on the other hand, provided a metaphor that was repeatedly deployed from the 1920s onwards. An early example was the 1927 Russian short story Letargiia by Ivan Korvatskii: it was the account of a Russian \u00e9migr\u00e9 in Constantinople who awakes from nine years' sleep to discover that the nightmare of the Russian Revolution and Civil War had, in fact, been a dream, and that Russia under the Czar was now a respected world power -only to discover that his 'awakening' had been a dream. Only the title and a single line in the story allude to EL, but the influence is clear. 30 An English short story from 1924 involved a hare pursued by a fox, and at one point \"the hare hesitated, turned at right angles, and crossed the burn again. On the opposite bank she paused, then, as though possessed of sleeping sickness, she crawled slowly on.\" 31 This metaphor also found wider use as an expression of ennui. A New York journalist wrote in 1919: \"Central Park tempted, bock-beer signs beckoned, and that most fatal malady, 'Encephalitis lethargica', attacked. Sleeping sickness and music criticism, however, are old pals\"; 32 an astrological column noted that Aquarian children were energetic and hopeful, divinely human and \"not suffering from 'sleeping sickness' of the soul\". 33 The term 'lethargic encephalitis' was also employed in the press and elsewhere as a rather obvious metaphor or insult for those who were perceived to be inactive or indolent, including, of course, governments; an American correspondent criticized the sloth of the post-War German economy with the comment that \"Germany's salvation depends as much on waking her people out of their spreading sleeping sickness as it does on getting food\", 34 while Anglican leaders complained that \"the Church was suffering from what doctors called Encephalitis lethargica \u2026 and wanted waking up\". 35 'Lethargy' had, however, been used for centuries by Protestant ministers to harangue their spiritually slothful flocks. A British parliamentarian asked in 1926 whether \"the medical profession are of the opinion that there would be a serious outbreak of sleepy sickness\" were Parliament to be broadcast on the radio, 36 and the metaphor is still occasionally labored today in political reporting. Republican responses to the foreign policy initiatives of the Obama administration, for example, were lampooned in the following manner: their \"spasmodic flurry of attacks, complaints, and self-pitying diatribes is so intense that they have succeeded in shuddering themselves into a state of frozen paralysis. Call it the political equivalent of encephalitis lethargica.\" 37 This reduction of EL to 'lethargy' persisted unabated until the 1970s. The diagnosis of EL by a local doctor in a traveller suffering a bout of Mexican diarrhea in Sam Shepard's 1967 play La turista, for instance, has little more to do with the actual disease than as a reference to the weariness of the sufferer: following the recital of an encyclopedic (and mostly confused) account of the features of the disorder, the doctor's best advice was that \"the patient must be kept in motion and, if possible, induced to talk. The more motion the better, lest it prove fatal. Benzedrine sulphate is also useful in some patients at this stage.\" 38",

The documentary, also titled Awakenings, introduced the 'Discovery' science television series, won awards at the 1978 American Film Festival and 1978 International Rehabilitation Film Festival. It is perhaps ironic that the documentary had still not been shown on American television as late as 2001; it was presented that year in a New York theatre in a session for medical personnel, moderated by Sacks. 39 The mystery of the 'sleeping' or 'frozen' patients from another time and the wonder of their 'awakening' generated immense public interest, attention that was not impeded by the then prevailing interest in altered consciousness in general, drug-induced and otherwise. Sacks' EL publications were admired in some quarters for their adventurous synthesis of neurology, psychoanalysis, physics, and philosophy, and dismissed by others for the same reason. They were, in any case, eminently readable accounts of his encounters with PEP patients and of their responses to L-DOPA. More importantly, Sacks' publications also recorded his patients' accounts of their own experiences -\"the lives and reactions of certain patients in a unique situation\" 40 -adding a palpably human element to his depiction of an otherwise impenetrable and alien disorder. In a footnote to his discussion of the philosophy he applied to understanding his patients, Sacks described an alternative to traditional subjective and objective narrative, an approach he denoted as 'trajective':",

Pirsig's Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance (1974) -but also by his perceptions of the implications of the L-DOPA effect for science and medicine as a whole: while most neurologists saw L-DOPA as alleviating the striatal dopamine deficit that underlies akinesia, Sacks presented the drug as a key that released the patient from motor confinement and thereby broadened their psychological perspectives. Not every patient, however, could make the adjustments that were required by their expanded potential, and this failure to adapt explaining for Sacks the inability of many to derive sustained benefit from the miracle drug, which ultimately proved to be only a partial solution to an extremely complicated neuropsychiatric problem.",

            "text": "Sacks' insights revitalized the currency of EL both as a theme and as a metaphor. His 1973 book inspired several adaptations of its themes, 42 the most prominent being the 1982 short 'memory play', A kind of Alaska, by British playwright Harold Pinter. 43 Deborah (played by Judi Dench in the original production) is woken by L-DOPA from her 29-year EL sleep, but is mentally still the 16-year-old she had been when her mind entered the cold, faraway place of the title. Despite passing resemblances to Sacks' Rose R. -there is also an implication that psychological factors may have played a role in Deborah's withdrawal from the world, and her dawning realization of what she has lost seems likely to motivate a return to her Alaska, echoing Sacks' views on Rose R.'s failure to accept her new reality -EL is essentially employed (in distorted form) merely as a convenient device in a psychological version of the classic legend of the sleeper who awakes to find their world radically altered and their former life irretrievable. One reviewer indeed saw the 29-year slumber less as a medical condition than as an extreme metaphor for ageing itself, Deborah reflecting the state of mind of the middle-aged person disturbed by the sudden consciousness that their life has somehow passed more rapidly than they had been previously aware: \"Where did time go? What did I do while it was passing? Why did I make so little of it?\" 44 A more direct adaptation of Sacks' book by Arnold Aprill (simply titled Awakenings) was staged in 1987 by the City Lit Theatre in Chicago, and received Sacks' approval, although other reviews of this attempt to portray his patients on stage were mixed. 45 The conceit of the long sleeper was also exploited by the 1985 American television movie Between the darkness and the dawn, directed by Peter Levin. The 37-year-old Abigail (Elizabeth Montgomery) awoke after twenty years' slumber caused by a \"rare encephalitis\" in 1964. This film garnered less than rapturous critical acclaim, being described as \"a candidate for the worst television movie of the year.\" 46 The Britons Pete Brooks and Jeremy Peyton Jones introduced their multimedia performance, The sleep: The strange case of sleepy sickness, -\"both an opera and a dream play\" that entwined the awakening of a patient after 40 years of 'sleeping sickness' with the Orpheus myth -at the 1987 Mayfest in Glasgow. Psychological factors (the condition was perhaps initiated by sexual shock) and usurpation of the patient's autonomy by cold medical authorities also played roles in this unusual interpretation. 47 More recently, an Indian film, Man Paakharu (2008), appears to have offered a Marathi version of the Awakenings story, but I have not been able to find any information other than an interview with the lead actor. 48 On the other hand, EL was reduced to its lethargic component in The archaeology of sleep (Julian Beck, Living Theatre, New York; 1984), an experimental performance described by the New York Times as \"a quasi-Adlerian, quasi-Joycean meditation on the 'millenium-old [sic] mysteries of sleep.' We know this not because of what happens on stage but because Mr. Beck announces his intentions in one of the program's several turgid manifestos.\" 49 The commercially most successful adaptation of Sacks' 1973 book was undoubtedly the 1990 Penny Marshall motion picture Awakenings, a fictionalized Hollywood version that starred Robin Williams as Malcolm Sayer (= Sacks) and Robert de Niro as Leonard Lowe (= the patient Leonard L.). The movie was lighter in tone and much more optimistic than the book, increasing the popular appeal of its otherwise tragic story. Its success also revived interest in Sacks' book, motivating publication of a revised edition. Critical appraisal was mixed: the movie and its screenplay were nominated for Academy Awards, as was De Niro as lead actor. De Niro was awarded several other critics' prizes for his portrayal of Leonard, and one reviewer hailed his performance \"a physical wonder, a stony guise that gives way to a sideshow of wracking tics.\" 50 Sacks himself was impressed by his depiction of parkinsonian symptoms in the film, the result of De Niro observing PD patients for an extended period: I think in an uncanny way, De Niro did somehow feel his way into being Parkinsonian. So much so that sometimes when we were having dinner afterwards I would see his foot curl or he would be leaning to one side, as if he couldn't seem to get out of it. I think it was uncanny the way things were incorporated. 51 In the same 1996 interview, however, Sacks commented that at \"other levels I think things were sort of sentimentalized and simplified somewhat.\" He commented elsewhere that the Marshall film accurately reflected the emotional state of his patients, but took liberties that enhanced the dramatic effect of the situation: prior to his treatment Leonard, for example, was not the completely rigid, statue-like patient depicted in the film. 52 The movie has indeed been widely criticized for its Hollywood saccharinity, particularly the perceived need to embellish an otherwise thought-provoking complex of medical and human elements with unnecessary romantic and other melodramatic elements. This was particularly the case outside the United States; the reviewer for the leading German weekly news magazine, for example, found that:",

The description of the onset of Audrey's disease in the novel, on the other hand, is confused, with the first parkinsonian symptoms preceding the lethargy, which itself appears to have been more of a febrile delirium with amnesia than acute EL -perhaps once more reflecting the difficulty in grasping the nature of this curious disorder. EL primarily served as a tool for the exploration of the ideas that Self wished to explore in his novel, most notably the 'construction' of one's individual world, rather than as a faithful representation of the disease. This direction was already present in Sacks' 1973 book, and had been repeatedly taken up by each successive adaptation.

Although described as a 'novel', it is written as a semi-documentary re-examination of European history and culture between the World Wars under the influence of the \"epidemic of bizarre dreams\", a conflation of historical facts and the speculative re-telling of the EL story as an explanation for not only the elusive personalities of cultural and political figures, such as Greta Garbo and Franz Kafka, Adolf Hitler and J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski, but also for the madness and political violence that infected Europe from the early 20th century. Although the book reads like a non-fictional, if conspiratorial work, it actually arose as a series of unconnected stories; only when they were ready for publication did Kuleta encounter the EL literature that moved him to adopt the epidemic as a linking theme. The author nevertheless insisted that almost everything in the book was true, if perhaps overinterpreted: \"it is impossible to speak of the 20th century without telling the story of encephalitis lethargica.\" 63 Kuleta's book is an entertaining story, in any case, and less outlandish than other attempts to impose EL as an explanation for historical events; for instance, one author interpreted the unusual behavior of women that led to the Salem witch trials in the 1690s as EL-related, whereby she viewed EL as an arbovirus infection. 64",

            "text": "In 1951, science fiction Robert Anson Heinlein included EL as one of the diseases that might be deployed against invading parasitic 'slugs' in his novel The puppet masters; \"nine-day fever\" was ultimately deployed instead, but 'encephalitis' was retained as the rescuing infection in the 1994 film based on the novel. More recently, the Neil Gaiman (b. 1960) graphic novel Sandman (originally published in 1988) commenced with EL (conflated with African sickness) as being the result of Morpheus or Dream (= the Sandman) being imprisoned by an occultist in 1916. 65 In the Canadian television series ReGenesis, about scientific investigations by the 'North American Biotechnology Advisory Commission' (Toronto) of mysterious events and disasters in the present day, the pathogen of EL proved to be a widely distributed human retrovirus (it is discovered that the virus has since been integrated into chromosome 11 of the human genome) that is re-activated in US military personnel in 2006; the symptoms of the re-awakened disease included headache, flu-like symptoms, and mild fever, developing further to blurred vision, severe muscular pain, slowed physical and mental responses, as well as sleepiness ranging to coma. This is the only reference to EL in a science fiction setting that in its clinical presentation even resembles the historical disorder, although a number of details were incorrect: the reference to two million fatal cases during the 1920s, the matching of the retroviral sequence with that of the EL virus (isolated from a corpse exhumed in Spitzbergen), the (disappointed) expectation that the acute disease could be treated with L-DOPA. 66 EL has also been the subject of occasional documentaries. Apart from the 1974 Yorkshire Television program on Sacks' patients, the two most important have been the BBC1 documentaries Prisoners of the forgotten plague (1998; 30 minutes) and Mystery of the forgotten plague (2004; 60 minutes; part of the Medical Mysteries series). Prisoners briefly related the story of 1920s EL and its outcome, including the life of one its victims, Philip Leather, as well as the Sacks story. British virologist John Oxford discussed the possibility that EL might have been caused by the influenza virus, and could thus return. Oxford also discussed this in the second part of the BBC2 Horizon program Pandemic, described on the video packaging as a \"drama-documentary [that] attempts to predict how the next influenza pandemic will hit us.\" This possibility was seemingly confirmed by the described case of Becky Howells, a 23-year-old woman who had reputedly contracted the disease in 1993; her neurologist had seen several more cases since. Mystery of the forgotten plague also commenced with the Howells case, but took the 2004 paper by Dale and colleagues as its focus, concentrating on the auto-immune hypothesis of EL. The material accompanying the program included a lot of the inappropriately dramatized information commonly associated with current discussions of EL, including the claim that \"in the 1920's an incurable disease that turned ordinary people into living statues caused global panic\", and that \"during the outbreak, nearly a million died, and millions more were left frozen inside their useless bodies, in institutions.\" 67 The Becky Howells case provides a link with the recent 'acute encephalitis lethargica' cases discussed in the previous chapter, being the first to attract attention in the non-medical press. 68 At about the same time, 17-year-old Sophie Cameron suffered encephalitis and then a cardiac arrest that resulted in severe brain damage, robbing her of speech and mobility. This inspired the foundation of the Sophie Cameron Trust in 2004, which raised funds for encephalitis research until 2010. 69 These and similar reports not only confirmed in the popular mind the identity of historical EL and contemporary EL-like syndromes in Britain, but also blurred to some extent the distinction between EL and encephalitis in general. The widespread impression of EL today is consequently a confused m\u00e9lange of sketchy knowledge of the original disease and more recent cases of acute encephalitis. In particular, there was no apparent link between Ms Cameron's tragic case and EL; but this does not, of course, devalue the work of the Trust: indeed, supporting research into a contemporary disease, rather than into an extinct entity, is of more practical benefit, particularly as investigations of rare conditions often struggle to find funding. The problem is that denoting two separate diseases as 'encephalitis lethargica' can be confusing, and not only for non-medical people, particularly with respect to outcome: the sometimes frightening aspects of current 'encephalitis lethargica' cases are alarming enough for parents without adding the fear that their child might one day resemble the characters in Awakenings.",

Philip had been a wonderfully creative child and self-taught pianist, but from the age of six years had begun to withdraw from the world. His behavior deteriorated over the following years; he was walking with a stoop and his eyes were partially paralysed by the time he was 12 years old, and communication had been reduced to the barest minimum. He finally hid beneath his bedclothes for three days, signaling to his parents that he was in real trouble: diagnosed with EL (presumably contracted during 1920/21) by no less than George Auden, the inaugural School Medical Officer in Birmingham and authority on childhood EL, Philip was admitted to the Hollymoor Mental Hospital at the age of eleven years, a hospital with no children's ward, and with no hope of cure. As life moved on outside his room, he remained largely immobile and silent, although something of his mind remained alive: he enjoyed ice cream and beer throughout his life, and when this was forgotten at one of his later Christmas parties, he burst into tears. 70 By the time Philip died, almost ninety years had passed since EL first appeared in Europe, and its cause was still unknown, as was the reason for its rapid retreat. But there is no doubt that the EL epidemic played a major role in the development of the clinical and laboratory neurosciences between the World Wars: it was intimately involved in the conceptualization of the extrapyramidal motor system -defined according to both its the functional and biochemical features (the presence of high iron levels) -resulting in the \"dethronement of the motor cortex, or at least the elimination of its motor autarchy.\" 71 EL thereby uncovered the significance of the substantia nigra for motor control, and of the basal ganglia in general for the generation of basic motor patterns that underlie the smooth execution of voluntary motor activity:",

The similarities between certain EL-related states and schizophrenia could not be overlooked, including the troublesome symptom of catatonia (although, ironically, efforts to distinguish EL-related psychiatric symptoms from those of schizophrenia resulted in motor symptoms being largely expunged from definitions of 'genuine psychosis' by the late 1930s), while its even more frequent production of 'hysterical symptoms' -particularly the litany of involuntary, iterative motor symptoms of the chronic phase, all bizarre and most previously unknown: \"oculogyric crises \u2026 disturbances of tongue and mouth movements in the form of complicated, automatisms \u2026 respiratory spasms \u2026 yawning, laughing, shouting, barking attacks \u2026 hand rubbing, paper plucking, clothes tearing \u2026 pants rubbing, scratching, finger fumbling \u2026 compulsive walking and running \u2026 compulsive lateral deviations of the head, man\u00e8ge movement-like rotations of the body about its axis when attempting to walking \u2026 the inability to sit still, compulsive acquisitiveness \u2026 \" 73 -contributed massively to the final dissolution of hysteria as a nosologic entity, particularly by exposing the role of extrapyramidal and brainstem centres in the production of these symptoms.",

The pathogen of EL, as a virus that could seemingly infect the mind, had undermined concepts of the will, of volition, as a single, unitary function, let alone as a localized faculty, and promoted concepts of consciousness as a phenomenon that was not the preserve of any single brain region, and certainly not entirely attributable to functions housed in the cerebral cortex. The lessons of this disease also suggested that sleep -itself clearly no longer a single function controlled by an on/off switch in the brain, but instead the complex co-ordination of several linked but autonomous cortical and subcortical rhythms and functions that could be separately disturbed by disease -attention, and consciousness were linked but distinct functions, and that fibres coursing through the central grey of the brainstem, as well as other subcortical structures, were critically involved in the elaboration of higher mental functions presumed to be the preserve of the cortex. The failure to identify cortical lesions in schizophrenia were now less surprising in light of the dramatic personality and cognitive effects of an infection that generally produced detectable lesions in the brainstem.

Vegetative functions, the neural mechanisms of sleep, extrapyramidal motor control and muscular tone, models of consciousness, personality and volition, neuroses and psychoses: it seemed that there were few areas of neuroscience in which concepts were untouched by the experience of the phenomena of EL:",

It is to be hoped that this will not provide yet another reason for these theoreticians to simply ignore them. 76 Economo believed that the impact of EL upon neuroscience was such that the disease would never be forgotten, even should it prove, as it then seemed, that its time as an epidemic disorder had ended. EL was, however, indeed largely forgotten within a generation of its vanishing. Diseases rarely impose themselves upon the public memory as much as political events, with their well delineated chains of events and identifiable lead characters. This is all the more true for a 'vanished' disease such as EL: while the occasional review recalling its strangeness might evoke some interest, a disease that no longer threatens anyone is easily consigned to the archives. Many of the lessons learned during the EL period were also shelved, at least temporarily: the biological holism epitomized by EL was soon to lose its integrity, as its merciless and irrational melding with race theory and political ambition in Germany discredited biological psychiatry for two generations. It is to be hoped that the revival of neuropsychiatry will foster understanding and tolerance, as anticipated by its progenitors prior to 1933, not the desire to eliminate all that is atypical, less socially acceptable, or 'unworthy'.",

There have also been other instances of diseases disappearing -it is some time, for instance, since the once ominous SARS virus has made itself noticeable, and the precipitous decline in the incidence of rheumatic fever (and the associated heart disease and other consequences) in the Western world since the early 20th century remains unexplained.",

We do not know why EL came or why it departed, or even which 'virus' was the source of its power. We should perhaps just be grateful that encephalitis lethargica appears to have disappeared for good, as the question as to whether we should fear its return cannot be sensibly discussed without knowing more about whose return we are dreading.",
