How vaccines might alter the senescent immune response and what are the immune correlates of protection will be addressed from the perspective of 1) stimulating a previously primed response as in the case of vaccines for seasonal influenza and herpes zoster, 2) priming the response to novel antigens such as pandemic influenza or other viruses, 3) vaccination against bacterial pathogens such as pneumococcus, and 4) altering the immune response to an endogenous protein as in the case of a vaccine against Alzheimer's disease. In spite of the often limited efficacy of vaccines for older adults, influenza vaccination remains the only cost-saving medical intervention in this population. Thus, considerable opportunity exists to improve current vaccines and develop new vaccines as a preventive approach to a variety of diseases in older adults.

It is important to distinguish these studies from those in older people in the nursing home setting who represent a small minority of the population age 65 years and older; multiple chronic diseases have already impacted on morbidity and disability and immune function may no longer be representative of the senescent phenotype. As a population, the majority of older adults experience \"usual aging\" where independence is maintained in the community but risk for complicated illness is associated with one or more underlying chronic diseases. From a public health perspective, usual aging older adults are the largest segment of the population age 65 years and older and should be the target population for new vaccine development; the goal is to compress morbidity to the extremes of life-\"adding life to years\".",

The goal of vaccination in this population should be clinical protection rather than sterilizing immunity; sterilizing immunity is predicted by antibody titres whereas estimates of vaccine efficacy with respect to clinical protection require an evaluation of both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses to a vaccine or the relevant pathogen. In addition, vaccines need to be tested in usual aging older adults who experience a variety of common medical conditions and related medications, and mental and psychosocial health issues, all of which may interact with functional independence. While studies of healthy older adults will help us to understand the effect of aging on the immune response, translating this research to vaccine preventable disease and improved health outcomes in the 65 and older population requires the identification of \"modifiable risk\" at all levels of innate and adaptive immune function.",

In spite of only 40-60% efficacy in older adults [3] , current influenza vaccination programs are cost-effective in older people and even cost saving in developed countries due to the 30-40% reduction in influenza-related hospitalizations [4, 5] . The fact that these vaccines also prevent complications of influenza (pneumonia, heart attacks, strokes and exacerbations of congestive heart failure) provides an even greater incentive to increase the use of existing vaccines and develop new vaccines that are targeted to improve the senescent immune response [6, 7] . However, a limited understanding of the immune mechanisms that underlie the increased risk for complicated illness and decline in the response to vaccination in this population, pose a significant challenge to new vaccine development.",

Influenza vaccine is the most studied vaccine in older adults and well understood in terms of the potential immunologic determinants of clinical protection in this population. Thus, the response to this virus in the context of age-related changes in the adaptive immune system, will be discussed in significant detail as an example of what we might anticipate in terms of other potentially vaccine preventable diseases in older people. Influenza virus stimulates an antiviral response in bone-marrow-derived lymphocytes (B-cells), monocytes and thymus-derived lymphocytes (T-cells) resulting in humoral and cell-mediated immunity, respectively. However, the effectiveness of this stimulus depends on the presentation of viral peptides to the T-lymphocytes There are two main cell types within the T-lymphocyte population, helper T-cells and cytotoxic T-cells. Helper T-cells are further sub-typed (according to the cytokines they produce) as T helper type 1 (T h 1), T helper type 2 (T h 2), T helper type 3 or regulatory T-cells (T h 3/Treg), and T helper type 17 (T h 17) cells. The response to influenza virus in adult populations is the result of restimulation of a previously primed response through exposure to natural infection or prior vaccination. Virus-activated T-cells, through a variety of cytokine mediators, stimulate B-cells to differentiate and produce antibodies that are specific for the strains of virus contained in the vaccine [8] . These specific antibodies bind to the surface glycoproteins (haemagglutinin [HA] and neuraminidase [NA]), to neutralize the viral particle. The peptide sequences on the outer surfaces of HA and NA change as a result of high mutation rates in the influenza virus and selective pressure by the immune system against the native virus, a phenomenon known as antigenic drift. Influenza vaccines are updated annually to ensure that antibody-mediated immunity is stimulated to the relevant predicted strains of the H3N2 and H1N1 subtypes of influenza A, and influenza B.",

            "text": "Haemagglutination inhibition assays are the current industry standard for measuring antibody responses to influenza vaccination as a proxy for vaccine efficacy. There is significant literature reporting a decline in antibody titres with aging summarized in a recent metanalysis of these studies [9] . However, many of these studies have not defined the health status of study participants, their vaccination status, or the setting in which they live. Studies of the antibody response to influenza vaccination over multiple influenza seasons comparing healthy young adults to relatively healthy adults (probably representing \"usual aging\") have shown no difference between these two groups [10, 11] . These results suggest that aging alone does not affect the antibody response to influenza vaccination as measured in hemagglutination inhibition assays, and thus do not explain the differences in vaccine efficacy between young and older adults. Furthermore, even though the antibody response to vaccination might be predicted to decrease with repeated vaccination in older adults, annual repeated vaccination, in fact, improves protection against influenza [12] [13] [14] . Another postulate for the differences in vaccine-mediated protection in young and older adults has been that the duration of the antibody response to influenza vaccination may be shortened in older persons and not provide protection through the influenza season. However, a recent review found no evidence in the published literature of a premature decline in antibody titres during the influenza season in community-dwelling older adults [15] .",

Although self-renewing populations of virus-specific CD8 T-cells are maintained in the lymphoid organs for many years after influenza and other respiratory virus infections, protective cellular immunity is short-lived and disappears within about 6 months [23].

Because killed virus (contained current parenteral influenza vaccines) is effectively presented on MHC II and not MHC I, T h and B-cells are stimulated to produce good antibody responses, but only weak CTL responses are seen in adults; this CTL response that is not seen in influenza-na\u00efve individuals, results from restimulation of a previously primed response to influenza through natural infection [28] [29] [30] [31] . This process is postulated to be the mechanism by which inactivated viruses including split-virus influenza vaccines can stimulate CTLs in populations primed by a previous influenza infection [30] . Boosting T-cell responses is an important priority for vaccine development, in general, due to broader protection against serologically distinct strains of virus [23, 36, 37] . Because immunosenescence alters several aspects of cell-mediated immune function, vaccine design can include independent strategies for effectively stimulating T h and CTL responses.",

Previously, T h 1 and T h 2 were defined by their cytokine products such that the T h 1 cytokine, IFN-\u03b3, down-regulated T h 2, and IL-10 downregulated T h 1 [38] [39] [40] . While this paradigm is generally applicable in the mouse model, recent studies have questioned the validity of the T h 1/ T h 2 paradigm in humans, and the contributions of regulatory T-cells (Treg or T h 3) and T h 17 subsets to cytokine regulation are only beginning to be understood [41] . Under a revised model, na\u00efve CD4+ helper T-cells are stimulated by IL-12 to produce IFN-\u03b3 (i.e. become T h 1); IL-4 stimulates T h 2 to produce IL-4, IL-5, IL-13; and IL-1, IL-6 and IL-23 stimulate T h 17 to produce IL-17, IL-22 and IL-26. These T h subsets have counter-regulatory interactions between each other [42] . Our data showed that the IFN-\u03b3:IL-10 ratio correlates with risk for influenza illness [17] but characteristics of the vaccine recipient and PBMC culture conditions may alter this relationship [43] [44] [45] [46] . The apparent downregulation of IFN-\u03b3 by IL-10 may be T h 3-mediated rather than a shift from a T h 1 to a T h 2 response [47] , and the interaction with T h 17 has not been studied at all.",

However, a recent review of the application of the T h 1/ T h 2 paradigm in older adults highlights the discrepancies of results across a number of studies in older people [47] . In light of an evolving understanding of interaction of multiple T-cell subsets in humans, the response to influenza and influenza vaccination may be more complicated than predicted by these earlier studies. A reduction in the ratio of IFN-\u03b3 to IL-10 levels in response to ex vivo challenge of PBMC with live influenza virus, is associated with increased risk for influenza illness [17] . However, the source of IL-10 may be from multiple different T-cell subsets in these cultures including T h 3/Treg. Also, absolute cytokine levels are less likely to predict risk for influenza illness suggesting that it is the regulation of the different T-cell subsets that determines the response to influenza and clinical protection from illness. It may be the balance and regulation of T h 1/ T h 2/ T h 3/ T h 17 responses that is important for a protective response to vaccination in older adults and recovery from influenza illness [55] [56] [57] .",

The addition of these cytokines (IL-1, IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1) to spleen cells can reverse these age-related defects in T helper type 1 cytokine production [59] . The paradox is that IL-6 levels increase with age, chronic disease and stressors of the immune system and contribute to a proinflammatory state with increased production of IL-6 [60] and thus should stimulate rather than suppress T h 1.

The recent identification of T h 17 cells and their regulation through TGF-\u03b2 and IL-6 production and T h 3/Treg [61, 62] , may shed further light on differences in cytokine regulation, susceptibility and health outcomes, and the relationship with acute illnesses versus chronic diseases.",

Even though current inactivated influenza vaccines stimulate a CTL response in older and even chronically ill older adults [71] , this response is diminished compared to young adults [72] [73] [74] and is not as robust as the response to natural infection [75] .

Granzyme B (GrzB) is a key element of the T-cell response to influenza in the lung [77] [78] [79] . An assay of GrzB activity in lysates of influenza virus-stimulated PBMC correlates with cytolytic activity by standard 51 Cr-release assays [80, 81] but has the advantage of being a more sensitive measure of cytolytic activity that is detectable in ex vivo virus-activated PBMC. Ex vivo levels of GrzB in lysates of influenzastimulated PBMC correlate with risk for influenza illness in older adults [17] . Other ex vivo studies have shown no difference in influenza-specific CTL frequencies in older compared to young adults [82] . Taken together, these studies suggest that in influenza susceptible older persons, there is defect in the amount of GrzB produced on a per CTL basis.",

Other studies have reported heterogeneous cytokine responses to influenza vaccination in healthy older people that are related to characteristics of the vaccine recipient and the vaccine [43] [44] [45] . The in vitro proliferative response to influenza vaccine is associated with protection from influenza illness in ambulatory older adults [18] while antibody titres, tested in different settings, have not been consistently associated with risk for influenza illness in older people [17, 86] . In institutionalized older adults, IL-2 and IFN-\u03b3 responses to influenza are significantly associated with the level of independence in activities of daily living but do not predict protection against influenza illness [46] . Current killed virus vaccines have been shown to decrease the IL-10 (T h 3/Treg) response to influenza for an overall increase in the T h 1 (IFN-\u03b3) relative to the T h 3 response [87] , but the short duration of the response is not effectively re-stimulated with a booster vaccination [88] . Further the ratio of IFN-\u03b3:IL-10 has been shown to predict a protective response to influenza vaccination [17] . Killed virus vaccines stimulate a weak cytotoxic T-cell response and have limited efficacy in older adults. New developments in vaccine technology that improve the regulation of T h cytokines and potentially increase the CTL response look promising . Live-attenuated intranasal vaccines were developed to provide more effective stimulation of CTL. However, these vaccines have shown minimal additional benefit for preventing influenza in older adults when combined with the standard inactivated parenteral vaccines, although some improvements in symptoms [89] and immunogenicity [90] have been reported. Thus, the currently available killed virus vaccine given by injection is still the recommended vaccine for those aged 50 years and older.",

            "text": "With aging and the multiple immune responses that have been stimulated throughout one's lifetime, there is a gradual shift from predominantly na\u00efve T-cells to increasing proportions of memory T-cells. Thymic involution and the loss of na\u00efve T-cells with aging may thus exhaust the capacity to respond to new antigens. Recent studies have further delineated central and effector memory helper T-cells, and have shown that healthy older adults have T h responses to influenza vaccination similar to young adults. However, an age-related decline in IL-7 levels corresponds to failure to maintain or expand the effector memory helper T-cell response to influenza [91] . The importance of memory T-cells in recalling the response to the many crossreactive influenza epitopes may be a key element of both T h and CTL responses to split-virus vaccines. Features of 'successful aging' have been associated with well-preserved immune function while poor survival is predicted by high CTL counts, low helper T-cell counts, low numbers of B-cells and poor responses by T-cells to polyclonal stimulation [92, 93] . The phenomenon of replicative senescence has been associated with these changes and relates to the finite number of doublings (25-30 cycles) after which cell cycle arrest occurs [94] . In CTLs, this growth arrest is associated with increased production of several proinflammatory cytokines, resistance to apoptosis [95] , and loss of the costimulatory molecule, CD28, required for optimal stimulation of CTLs [96, 97] . CTL that do not express CD28 (CD28-CTL) have little or no cytolytic activity [98] and an increased proportion of CD28-CTLs is associated with a decline in antibody responses to influenza vaccination [99, 100] and a reduction influenza-specific memory CTL [101] . These changes have been associated with chronic cytomegalovirus infection driving the T-cell response to terminal differentiation and expressing this senescent phenotype [102, 103] . However, it remains uncertain the extent to which this change may affect the T h and CTL responses to influenza and influenza vaccination.",

While current vaccines are cost-saving, new influenza vaccines will be needed to avoid the anticipated crisis in health care related to the aging of the population. Recent studies suggest that there is a significant opportunity to exploit the reserve capacity of T-cells to respond to influenza antigens through enhanced antigen presentation, appropriate costimulation, and regulation of cytokine responses. Targeting identified immunologic mediators that modulate influenza risk in older people, and screening candidate vaccines for clinical trials using appropriate correlates of protection in this population, is critical to development of more effective influenza vaccines for an aging population. Since the early phases of vaccine development often rely on antibody titres as a surrogate of protection, this measure may fail to detect a more robust T-cell response and thus, a more effective vaccine for the 65 and older population.",

The age-related decline in T-cell function is well documented but there is only limited data on how T-cell responses to VZV change with aging. Further, as shingles is exclusively a human herpes virus, animal models are very limited and may not be helpful in identifying the mechanism by which aging precipitates shingles. Particularly due to the aging of the \"Baby Boomers\" the age 65 and older population will grow to represent 20% of the US population over the next three decades.

The incidence of PHN is almost negligible before age 50, but 21% of patients older than 60 years and 29% beyond age 70 become affected following an attack of shingles. This contrasts with shingles in children where the rash generally follows a mild case of chicken pox and is of little clinical significance [107] . Antiviral therapy is available but older people often do not present within the 48-72 hour window of onset of the rash necessary for initiation of effective treatment. In addition, 20% of older people who receive therapy within the therapeutic window still experience pain six months after the onset of the rash [108] . Particularly given the number of people who do not seek or receive timely and effective treatment of shingles, the prevalence of disability related to PHN is a major public health concern.",

            "text": "Because VZV is exclusively a human Herpes virus [110] , there are limited animal models that study only some aspects of VZV infection and reactivation [111] . From the studies to date, it appears that with the resolution of chickenpox, VZV-specific CTL access the dorsal root ganglion where VZV lives, to keep viral replication in check [111, 112] . At some point the virus escapes to replicate in nerves and skin to cause a very painful condition that continues even after the rash resolves. Whether or not reactivation of VZV is due to a general decline in CTL-mediated immunity or due to changes in VZV-specific CTL is unknown. These findings have not been studied as a potential mechanism for reactivation of VZV in older people. Further, the mechanism that keeps virus restricted to the dorsal root ganglion is unknown and it may be postulated that reactivation of VZV in older people is due to an increased number of CD8+CD28-VZV-specific CTL that produce IFN-\u03b3 but do not contain cytolytic mediators such as Grz B. This hypothesis would be consistent with the extensive literature on the age-associated loss of CD28 expression, telomerase activity and telomere length affecting both CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells that is also associated with repeated antigenic stimulation (Reviewed in [94] ). Reactivation of VZV is associated with marked inflammation of the dorsal root ganglion leading to nerve cell damage and the pain associated with PHN that often precedes the onset of the dermatomal rash. Inflammatory cytokines produced by a stressful event and in the early stages of VZV reactivation may further suppress CTL function. With aging, there is a loss of ability to downregulate the inflammatory response and probably leads to excess nerve damage in the dorsal root ganglion and increased pain that persists as PHN for greater than one year in more than 50% of adults age 70 years and older who experience PHN. Even appropriate antiviral treatment initiated within 72 hours of onset of the rash fails to prevent this complication. Clearly, re-establishing the normal immune response to this virus requires the stimulation of VZV-specific CTL and regulation of the appropriate cytokine response to suppress viral replication without causing inflammation.",

These changes lead to an increased risk of reactivation of VZV and the development and probably severity of PHN in older adults. Although suppression of VZV is unlikely to drive the general process of terminal differentiation of T cells as is the case with CMV, the loss of CD28 on VZV-specific T cells and co-stimulatory function, is a likely contributor to the risk for shingles and PHN. Effective vaccines against shingles may therefore need to stimulate T-cell subsets that express CD28 costimulatory molecules [113] and respond to novel strategies for antigen presentation.",

Futhermore, there was a reduction in the overall burden of illness in vaccinated subjects showing statistical significance for the primary endpoint in the trial. The vaccine strain of VZV is a previously attenuated live virus (Oka strain) that is predicted to stimulate humoral, T h and CTL responses. Importantly for this disease, antibody titers do not predict protection from reactivating the virus to cause shingles. The postulated mechanism of protection is stimulation of the VZV-specific T-cell response to vaccination and meas-ured by the IFN-\u03b3 enzyme-linked spot (ELISpot) assay [115, 116] . Given that this a live attenuated vaccine, safety testing included isolation of virus from all shingles cases following vaccination. Specimens collected from skin lesions in shingles cases in the post-vaccination period showed wild-type strains; the vaccine Oka zoster strain was not identified in any of the isolated specimens suggesting that this attenuated virus can be safely and effectively used to stimulate the senescent immune response. Since this clinical trial had relatively few exclusion criteria, the results of this clinical trial should be applicable to most adults age 60 or older who are not immunocompromised due to underlying diseases or medications.",

The fact that antiviral therapy has limited effectiveness in the treatment of zoster in older adults points to the need for strategies to prevent the disease and it disabling complications. However, the development of a vaccine against Herpes zoster depended on a very large clinical trial to determine vaccine efficacy based on clinical outcomes. In the absence of reliable immunologic markers of vaccine efficacy, there was significant risk that the vaccine would fail to show an improvement. If the vaccine had failed in this trial, there may have been limited interest from industry in moving forward with alternate plans to develop an improved vaccine. This again points to the need for more reliable surrogates of vaccine efficacy to test new vaccines in the early phases of clinical development and select for subsequent clinical trials, the vaccines that are most likely to improve outcomes in the 65 and older population.",

            "text": "Although the virus is genetically stable over time (in contrast to influenza), repeat infections throughout adult life are common suggesting that immunity to this virus wanes over time. Those older adults with increased risk for severe disease are those with congestive heart failure and chronic lung disease, the severely immunocompro-mised, and those living in long-term care facilities [119] . Estimates of RSV disease in this setting range from 5-10% of residents per year with pneumonia and death in 10-20% and 2-5% of cases, respectively. As with influenza illness in older adults, RSV results in prolonged lengths of hospital stay, significant disability and loss of independence in basic activities of daily living, and the need for a higher level of care at hospital discharge [120] . Studies of the immune response to RSV have shown that high levels of serum and/or nasal antibodies have been correlated with relative resistance to experimental challenge. Similarly, low serum and nasal antibody levels are risk factors for infection and disease severity in older adults but this is not an age-specific change [121, 122] . More importantly, older adults have a greater rise in antibody titres postinfection than do their younger counterparts [122] . Since the RSV virus does not undergo antigenic drift over time, one would predict better protection against recurrent RSV illness in older adults but instead there is a relative increased risk of RSV infection with aging. This observation may be explained by an age-related shift from a T h 1 to a T h 2 response to RSV, which has been shown to cause significant pathology in people. In the aged mouse model, diminished CD8+ CTL responses associated with decreased IFN-\u03b3 (T h 1) and increased IL-4 (T h 2), and higher RSV titres in lungs [123] . However, recent studies in human PBMC show no age-related changes in cytokine levels produced in response to RSV although the regulatory balance between inflammatory (IFN-\u03b3 and antiinflammatory (IL-10) cytokine levels may be altered [124] .",

The development of a vaccine against RSV has proven to be a significant challenge, perhaps due to the reliability of antibody titers as correlate protection in these trials. Deaths were observed in RSV-na\u00efve children in whom RSV infection restimulated the immune response to vaccination and resulted in a significant inflammatory response to RSV infection.

Current research is focused on predicting the strains that are likely to evolve so that new influenza vaccines can be developed to protect against these new strains.

This has implications for both prepandemic and pandemic vaccines. Pre-pandemic vaccines if formulated to more potently stimulate T-cells could offer cross-protective immunity and would enhance the production of strain-specific antibodies against the pandemic strain. Although this strategy may offer enhanced protection in older adults, prepandemic and pandemic vaccines will need to be tested for their ability to stimulate adequate antibody responses and cross-protective cell-mediated immunity.

Fortunately the outbreak was controlled without a vaccine and before it could reach epidemic proportions. Older adults may also be na\u00efve to viruses such as West Nile Virus (WNV) and Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and appear to be at increased risk of serious complications.

TNF-\u03b1, a macrophage product, is associated with an initial inflammatory response to pneumococcal invasion [139, 143] and has been found to be important in the development of antibodies to pneumococcal surface proteins [140, 145] . T h 2 cytokines including IL-4, although classically involved in stimulating B-cells to produce antigen-specific antibodies, may downregulate antibody responses to pneumococcus due to inhibitory effects on antigen-presenting cells [140] . IL-10, a product of both macrophages and T h 3 lymphocytes, is an antiinflammatory cytokine that also skews the in vivo immune response toward a T h 2 (humoral) by inhibiting a T h 1 (cell-mediated) response [146] . Increased IL-10 levels in animal models have been associated with increased risk for pneumococcal infection [142] . IL-12, a product of both phagocytic and antigen presenting cells, is a potent proinflammatory cytokine with a key role in resistance to bacterial infections. IL-12 upregulates the T h 1-mediated responses (IFN-\u03b3) which recruits neutrophils to the lungs and thus has a protective role in the response to pneumococcus [147, 148] . Dysregulation of T h -mediated cytokine responses with aging may thus contribute to the increased risk for pneumococcal infection in older adults. A greater understanding of the interactions between cytokine and antibody responses to pneumococcus and the immunologic determinants of risk for pneumococcal diseases are needed if improved vaccines are to be developed in older adults.",

            "text": "Alzheimer's Disease (AD) is caused by the deposition of \u03b2-amyloid protein (A\u03b2) in the brain with toxic effects leading to neuronal cell death, amyloid plaque formation and the development of neurofibrillary tangles. Based upon studies in mice, a vaccine containing the A\u03b2 1-42 peptide was shown to stimulate antibody production and improved cognitive function in mouse models of AD. This vaccine was advanced to a Phase II clinical trial based on the demonstration of no significant adverse effects of vaccination in a Phase I trial that included 200 subjects. The Phase II trial was halted due to the development of aseptic meningoencephilitis in 6% of the 300 vaccinated subjects. Analysis of the antibody response to A\u03b2 showed a trend toward cognitive enhancement in the \"responders\" to vaccination (antibody titre to A\u03b2 1-42 \u2265 1:2200) but 22% of \"responders\" compared to 2% of \"nonresponders\" developed aseptic meningoencephilitis [149] . These results suggested that adverse effects of the vaccine were related to the immune response to the vaccine rather than toxicity of the A\u03b2 . Postmortem studies of the meningoencephilitis cases showed substantial clearing of A\u03b2 from the brain but with marked T-cell infiltration in brain tissue. The postulated age-related defect that leads to the pathology of AD related to APC uptake of A\u03b2 and stimulation of T h 1 cytokines, is an inflammatory response to A\u03b2. This defect is associated with inefficient phagocytosis of A\u03b2 and the production of inflammatory cytokines (IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1) and chemokines, and nitric oxide leading to complement activation and T-cell apoptosis [150] . The immune mechanism being targeted by the vaccine was T-cell-dependent antibody production against A\u03b2 to form A\u03b2-antibody complexes for more efficient clearing of the A\u03b2. Earlier studies had shown that A\u03b2 1-42 effectively stimulated a proliferative response in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. This response was increased in older compared to young adult subjects and a further significant increase was observed in older adult subjects with AD [151] . It had been shown that A\u03b2 1-15 was responsible for B-cell stimulation and the production of antibodies to A\u03b2, and A\u03b2 15-42 most effectively stimulated T-cell proliferation and the production of both T h 1 (IFN-\u03b3) and T h 2 (IL-13) cytokines. Because a T h 1 (vs. T h 2) response in the AD mouse model was associated with more effective clearance of A\u03b2 in the mouse model, QS21 adjuvant was added to the A\u03b2 vaccine used in human trials to stimulate a Th1 response to the vaccine. It is postulated that the adjuvanted vaccine activated A\u03b2-specific memory T-cells that migrated to the sites of A\u03b2 deposition in the brain and produced Th1 cytokines. Although the antibody response appeared to effectively clear A\u03b2, the inflammatory cytokine response of the T-cell infiltrate lead to meningoencephalitis. Since the A\u03b2 15-42 stimulated both Th1 and Th2 cytokines, it appears that the addition of the QS21 adjuvant may have been responsible for the serious adverse effects of the A\u03b2 vaccine [150] . While efforts continue to develop immunologic-based therapies for AD, the results of this clinical trial will have significant consequences for future vaccine development. Lessons learned from the Alzheimer vaccine trial suggest that targeting the aged immune system through vaccination to produce a more effective response may be a \"double-edged vaccine\" [152] .",

These are largely attributed age-related changes in T-cell-mediated immunity and defects in defense mechanisms mediated by Th1 (IFN-\u03b3) and CTL. This would suggest that more potent vaccines for older adults should stimulate Th1 and CTL to a particular pathogen. However, the underlying mechanism for defective immune responses in older people remains poorly understood including the potential negative impact of elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines (including IFN-\u03b3). In spite of our limited understanding, a number of available vaccines have been shown to cost-effective and even cost-saving in older adults. Future research to better understand the immunologic targets for the prevention or treatment of a variety of acute and chronic diseases will make a significant contributions to \"adding life to years\".
