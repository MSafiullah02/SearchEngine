In an acute infectious disease, anorexia can be rationalized to provide some beneficial effect: metabolic switch to hepatic acute phase protein synthesis, rest of gastrointestinal tract or prevention of bacterial growth via reduced availability of nutrients essential for microorganisms [1], resulting in better prognosis [1]. In a chronic disease such as cancer, the chronicity of anorexia leads to malnutrition, body weight loss and eventually cachexia [2]. The mechanism(s) of anorexia is multifactorial and includes both peripheral and central factors [3], which await further identification.",

This suggests that meal size and meal number be regulated independently via closely coordinated systems [4], [5], [6]. Under pathological conditions, a reduction of food intake occurs via a reduction of either meal size or meal number or both, thus providing insights into the etiology and the possible mechanisms of the pathogenesis of eating behavior [6].

Food access, via a feeding tunnel, is monitored via photocells. Food consumption is measured via an electronic scale. Both data are integrated in real-time and continuously recorded during successive light/dark cycles.

The P value is calculated to test the null hypothesis that there is no correlation between food intake and meal size or food intake and meal number.

The average decrease in food intake per rat was about 6.4 g/day. This calculates to an average decrease of 21.2 kcal/day/rat. For maintenance, a rat needs approximately 110 kcal/kg0.75/day [12], which corresponds to 40.6 kcal/day for the average rat in this study which weighed 265 g. The rats started out eating an average of 17 g/day, which equals 37.3 kcal/day. The difference is probably attributable to errors inherent in averaging both the animal weights and food intake. Over the 10-day period of decreased intake, this was reduced by 21.2 kcal/day to an average intake of 16 kcal/day. Since they require about 40 kcal/day and they were taking in 16 kcal/day, there was a net loss of 24 kcal/day. Conversion of protein, fats, and carbohydrates produces an average gain of approximately 6.4 kcal/g [13]. This roughly corresponds to an average weight loss of about 3.75 g/day or 37.5 g/rat over the 10-day period of decreased intake. It appears that the average rat lost approximately 30 g; the difference being attributable to averaging variable of animals, imprecision in the calculations, and other factors that make this only an estimation. It would appear that the entire loss of body weight could be accounted for by the decrease in food intake, although other unmeasured factors (such as changes in metabolic requirements) were not examined.",

But, it is similar to that of anorexia of indomethacin-induced ulcerative ileitis, where we previously measured an increase in plasma tumor-necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1 [18]. The SDA virus belongs to the coronavirus family, which has been documented to increase TNF-\u03b1 [19]. Pentoxifylline (an anti-TNF-\u03b1 agent) inhibits TNF-\u03b1 induced hypophagia [20]. It is interesting to note that with recovery from the SDA viral infection, meal number slightly increased. This pattern of recovery may represent the process of normalization of food intake during the recovery period after human viral infection, such as mumps or influenza.",

Previously, we reported that in female Lewis rats with indomethacin-induced ulcerative ileitis, food intake decreased mainly via a decrease in meal size and to a lesser extent via a decrease in meal number [18]. This decrease in meal size correlated negatively with plasma TNF-\u03b1 [18]. Even when considering difference in gender and rat strain, the changes in food intake and feeding pattern between the SDA viral infection and the indomethacin-induced ulcerative ileitis model is similar. These changes have not been previously observed in the other rat models in both genders (e.g., in MCA sarcoma-bearing female Fischer-344 rat model, food intake decreases only via a decrease in meal number; [35]). Thus, the similarity in pattern of decreased food intake during the SDA viral infection and that during indomethacin-induced ulcerative ileitis, suggests a mechanistic link between viral infection, TNF-\u03b1, and anorexia. Furthermore, data that an infection with the influenza virus is associated with increased TNF-\u03b1 activity in lung lavage fluid of male Swiss\u2013Webster mice [11], and the manifestation of severe anorexia even in IL-1\u03b2-deficient mice [10], suggest a significant and limited role of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2 in anorexia during a viral infection, respectively.",

Thus, during an SDA virus infection, additional cytokines, such as IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, and/or IFN, may play a contributory role in decreasing food intake [3], [11]. Particularly, a recent study suggests a role for IFN-\u03b3 in causing hypophagia and hypermetabolism during infection [36]. Since these cytokines act on the hypothalamus to modulate food intake and feeding behavior, they might have a direct or an indirect influence on the LHA to decrease meal size and on the VMN to inhibit a compensatory increase in meal number during the SDA virus infection.",
