            "text": "The response of pathophysiological research to emerging epidemics often occurs 26 after the epidemic and, as a consequence, has little to no impact on improving 27 patient outcomes or on developing high-quality evidence to inform clinical 28 management strategies during the epidemic. Rapid and informed guidance of 29 epidemic (research) responses to severe infectious disease outbreaks requires quick 30 compilation and integration of existing pathophysiological knowledge. As a case 31 study we chose the Zika virus (ZIKV) outbreak that started in 2015 to develop a 32 proof-of-concept knowledge repository. To extract data from available sources and 33 build a computationally tractable and comprehensive molecular interaction map we 34 applied generic knowledge management software for literature mining, expert 35 knowledge curation, data integration, reporting and visualisation. A multi-disciplinary 36 team of experts, including clinicians, virologists, bioinformaticians and knowledge 37 management specialists, followed a pre-defined workflow for rapid integration and 38 evaluation of available evidence. While conventional approaches usually require 39 months to comb through the existing literature, the initial ZIKV KnowledgeBase 40 (ZIKA KB) was completed within a few weeks. Recently we updated the ZIKA KB 41 with additional curated data from the large amount of literature published since 2016 42 and made it publicly available through a web interface together with a step-by-step 43 guide to ensure reproducibility of the described use case (S4). In addition, a detailed 44 online user manual is provided to enable the ZIKV research community to generate 45 hypotheses, share knowledge, identify knowledge gaps, and interactively explore 46 and interpret data (S5). A workflow for rapid response during outbreaks was 47 generated, validated and refined and is also made available. The process described 48 here can be used for timely structuring of pathophysiological knowledge for future 49 3 threats. The resulting structured biological knowledge is a helpful tool for 50 computational data analysis and generation of predictive models and opens new 51 avenues for infectious disease research. 52 53 Availability: www.zikaknowledgebase.eu 54 55 Funding 56 European Commission's Seventh Framework Research Programme project 57 PREPARE (FP7-Health n\u00b0602525) and ZIKALLIANCE (MK, H2020; No 734548). 58 59 Author summary 60 During the recent ZIKV outbreak there was little information about the interactions 61 between Zika virus and the host, however, the massive research response lead to a 62 steep increase in the number of relevant publications within a very short period of 63 time. At the time, there was no structured and comprehensive database available for 64 integrated molecular and physiological data and knowledge about ZIKV infection. 65 Researchers had to manually review the literature (amounting to over 5000 articles 66 on ZIKV during our last update of the ZIKA KB in September 2018) to extract 67 information about host-pathogen interaction and affected molecular, cellular and 68 organ pathways. We explored the use of automated literature analysis and a defined 69 cooperative effort between experts from various scientific, biomedical and 70 information-technology domains to rapidly compile existing pathophysiological 71",

Responding to an ID outbreak therefore would benefit from the use of a 94 knowledge repository that organizes the disease-related knowledge into pathway, 95 molecular interaction and disease maps. Such maps are a relatively new concept 96 that have been used in neurodegenerative and heart diseases (1,2), but which have 97 compounds and diseases (for instance \"activates\", \"restricts\", \"targets\"). To optimise 220 recall and specificity of the mining, we extended the dictionaries for viral names, 221 acronyms and interaction predicates as well as defined a black-list of acronyms 222 causing mostly false positives. The term \"microcephaly\" is a reusable scientific concept that participates not just in 230 one \"Subject-Predicate-Object\" construct detected, but in all such constructs 231 detected that mention \" microcephaly\". Supplementary information is associated with 232 the \"microcephaly\" object, including, for example, information from the Disease 233 ontology, and other integrated resources, such as Gene-Disease-Association data 234 (DisGeNET). This expandable set of relationships forms a large network of 235 knowledge that enables new knowledge to be inferred by \"reasoning\" based on the 236 logic encoded in those relationships. 237 238 Finally, the extracted relationships can be curated to manually optimise quality and 239 information content. A curation user interface was implemented to enable the expert 240 team to support or refute the automatically generated relationships. At least two 241 independent researchers (the \"4-eye review mode\") manually evaluated the 242 evidence for every extracted relationship. In the case that the evaluations from the 243 two researchers conflicted, the conflicts were either resolved during the weekly 244 online conferences or were excluded, as our goal was to maximise specificity 245 (correctness) rather than sensitivity (completeness) of the integrated information. 246",

Interestingly, 415 four of the predicted ZIKV effective drugs (Mefloquine, Mebendazole, Sorafenib and 416 Dactinomycin) are associated with genes which, through PPIs, are involved in ErbB 417 signalling. ErbB is associated with the development of neurodegenerative diseases 418 when inactivated (33). Four of these genes (MYC, GSK3B, BRAF and MAP2K2) are 419 reported to be up-regulated in a published RNAseq analysis (28) performed in 420 Based on the text mining analyses performed here, disease profiles for the set of five 521 neurotropic flaviviruses were confirmed.

These genes can serve as 421an entry point to be tested in specific assays designed to unravel molecular 422 mechanisms between of ZIKV involvement in microcephaly. 423Another predicted ZIKV effective drug is Sorafenib, a multi-target tyrosine kinase 424inhibitor. The ZIKV map was used to identify the effective target of Sorafenib: 4251. Sorafenib interacts with 4 target genes, FLT3, BRAF, VEGFR (also known as 426 KDR) and PDGFR. The latter two genes are known to interact with additional drugs, 427 such as Sunitinib, Pazopanib, Dasatinib and Imatinib. These additional drugs were 428 among those which had no effect in the ZIKV infection assay. 429 2. In ZIKV infection expression data, none of the genes producing protein products 430 that interact with VEGFR and PDGFR through known PPI (orange edges) with ZIKV 431 are differentially expressed (Fig 8) . In contrast, BRAF and SOCS2, a FLT3 432 interactor, were unregulated upon ZIKV infection. 433Based on the observations above drawn from the ZIKV map, we hypothesise that 434 FLT3 or BRAF are the effective targets of Sorafenib in ZIKV infection, rather than 435 VEGFR and PDGFR. This exemplifies how molecular interaction and disease maps 436can be used to provide further insight into ZIKV biology. The network analysis described above could also be used to rank drugs according to 462 their distance to known ZIKV associated genes, such as STAT2, to suggest a metric 463 for priorisation in screening assays (34). The discussed extended ZIKV map contains 464 429 target gene products that interact with FDA approved drugs. Evaluation of the 465 distance between STAT2 and drug targets via experimentally proven PPIs revealed 466 that targets of ZIKV effective drugs were on average more proximal to STAT2 467 compared to other targets. 468Combining the proximity measure with additional knowledge, for example the \"FDA 469 pregnancy\" label, reduces the number of drugs to be screened from 774 to 64. pathogenesis. In addition to interactive exploration, a corresponding ranking of 516 connections in a network based on integration of multiple pieces of biological 517 evidence can also be performed systematically and on a large scale, for example, by 518 applying the ChainRank method (37) , which we plan to integrate in the future. 519 520 NCBI Taxonomy ontology. Compounds (white nodes) were referenced to entries of 724 the ChEBI ontology. Diseases (violet nodes) and genes (orange nodes) can 725 reference one or multiple sources such as ICD10, Entrez or Ensembl. Relationships 726 between pathogens, genes, drugs and compounds were defined by three types of 727 text mining relations, upregulation (green edges), downregulation (red edges) and 728 regulation (black edges). Associated information, not represented as object or 729 relation, is being stored as so called \"annotation\" basically a note that can be 730 assigned to any semantic concept. The annotation form \"Textmining information 731 evidence\", for example, stores information, such as the sentence containing the 732 extracted statement (field \"Reference\") or the predicate (field \"Interaction type\") and 733 links directly to the PubMed entry (represented as BioRS entry: MEDLINE). To 734 enable experts to support or contradict extracted text mining relationships the 735 annotation form \"Textmining Validation\" was introduced to generate a configurable 736 curation workflow. Molecular interaction and disease maps are modelled using the 737 \"context\" object type to group specific sub-networks (interactions between genes, 738 diseases, pathogens and drugs) within the global semantic network. PPI and drug-739 protein interactions are represented by the \"Interaction\" relation (orange edges) with 740 supportive evidence stored in two annotation forms (\"BioGRID Interaction Evidence\" 741 and \"Interaction Information\" storing information from the VirHostNet database), and 742can be added as additional sub-networks to a disease map. 743Based on the data model dynamic visualisation can be generated, for example drug 744 targets or differentially expressed genes based on configurable queries and views. 745The data model is automatically transformed into a natural language like query and 746reporting language. This language can be used to e.g. define a query retrieving the 747 number of drugs that interact with a protein of interest, and generating a view which 748 35 applies a colour code to a gene according to the number of interacting drugs.
