Rotaviruses belong to the Reoviridae family and possess a genome of 11 segments of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). The binomial classification system for rotaviruses is based on the two outer capsid proteins, VP7 (G genotype) and VP4 (P genotype) (Estes and Kapikian, 2007). At least 27 G and 35 P genotypes have been designated for human and animal strains (Matthijnssens et al., 2011). Five strains, G1P1A[8], G2P1B [4], G3P1A[8], G4P1A[8], and G9P1A[8] are the globally predominant human pathogens (Gentsch et al., 2005) and have been targeted in vaccine development.",

            "text": "Rotavirus strain surveillance programs typically use reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)-based methods to determine rotavirus genotypes directly from RNA extracted from stool specimens (Das et al., 1994, Gentsch et al., 1992, Gouvea et al., 1990) and rotavirus detection by real time RT-PCR (qRT-PCR) is increasing in use (Freeman et al., 2008). Fecal samples are among the most difficult clinical samples to process because of the presence of very potent inhibitors of nucleic acid amplification such as complex polysaccharides, bilirubin and bile salts (Chiu and Ou, 1996, Monteiro et al., 1997, Pandey et al., 1996). Difficulty in eliminating RT-PCR inhibitors from stool extracts has been reported extensively (Lantz et al., 1997, Makristathis et al., 1998, Monteiro et al., 1997, Petrich et al., 2006). Inhibitory effects can be reduced by adding amplification facilitators such as bovine serum albumin to the PCR reaction (Kreader, 1996), using thermostable polymerases that are more resistant to PCR inhibition (Abu Al-Soud and Radstrom, 1998), or using more efficient processes for extracting nucleic acid from stool samples. The efficiency of nucleic acid extraction and purification influences the sensitivity, reproducibility and the accuracy of RT-PCR target detection (Lim et al., 2005). During the last 10 years, several new manual, semi-automated and automated commercial nucleic acid or RNA extraction systems using magnetic beads or silica particles have been developed for DNA, RNA or total nucleic acid extraction which are attractive due to their flexibility, convenience, and ease of use (Tang et al., 2005a). A small number of studies have compared some of these novel extraction methods and reported that they differ in their ability to recover viral RNA, indicating that no single RNA extraction method is optimal for all viruses (Baert et al., 2007, Hale et al., 1996, Kok et al., 2000, Petrich et al., 2006).",

Each extraction method was chosen because it had been used previously in studies for the extraction of nucleic acid from stool. The MagNA Pure LC instrument has been used to purify nucleic acid from many types of clinical specimens including stool samples for rotavirus (Dalesio et al., 2004, Petrich et al., 2006, Schmid et al., 2004, Wolk et al., 2002, Wu et al., 2011) but is no longer in production so the MagNA Pure Compact instrument, which uses the same paramagnetic bead technology, was evaluated instead. The MagNA Pure Compact was used with the MagNA Pure Compact RNA Isolation Kit (Roche Applied Science Indianapolis, IN, USA). The easyMAG and miniMAG extraction platforms utilize the same silica extraction technology and use the same reagents. Both methods are universal and can be applied to a broad range of different specimens such as blood, sputum, serum, throat swabs and stool (Dundas et al., 2008a, Freeman et al., 2008, Loens et al., 2008, Perelle et al., 2009, Tang et al., 2005b). Both methods have been used for extraction of rotavirus RNA from stool (Hull et al., 2011). The easyMAG and miniMAG are mainly used in laboratories that require moderate- and low-throughput, respectively (Yang et al., 2011). The KingFisher Flex (96 deep well magnet head) designed for high throughput laboratories, is an automated extractor also used for rotavirus RNA extraction (Freeman et al., 2008, Grant et al., 2011, Hull et al., 2011). In this study it was used with the MagMax\u2122-96 Total RNA Isolation Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). The QIAamp Viral RNA Mini kit, which is based on silica membrane technology, has been used extensively for the extraction of rotavirus RNA from stool (Doan et al., 2011, Matthijnssens et al., 2006, Rahman et al., 2007a, Rahman et al., 2007b, Zeller et al., 2010).",

In brief, 200 \u03bcL of clarified 10% stool suspension was mixed directly with 400 \u03bcL 6 M guanidine thiocyanate (Ultrapure Grade; Boehringer Mannheim, Germany) and 10 \u03bcL of RNAID glass powder. The mixture was then vortexed and mixed on a Nutator rocker (Clay Adams Division, Becton-Dickinson, Parsippany, NJ, USA) for 15 min at room temperature. Each sample was then centrifuged for 60 s at 650 \u00d7 \ng and the supernatant was removed by aspiration with a Pasteur pipette. The samples were washed once with 700 \u03bcL of guanidine thiocyanate wash solution (4 M guanidine thiocyanate, 16.7 mM Tris\u2013HCl, pH 7.5) and centrifuged at 850 \u00d7 \ng for 60 s. The supernatant was aspirated and the samples were then washed two times with 400 \u03bcL of the RNAID kit wash buffer and centrifuged at 850 \u00d7 \ng for 60 s. The supernatant was aspirated, and the samples were washed once more with the same buffer and were then finally centrifuged at 10,000 \u00d7 \ng for 120 s. After aspiration of the supernatant, the samples were dried at room temperature for 1 h, resuspended in 35 \u03bcL of nuclease free water, and incubated for 10 min at 65 \u00b0C. The samples were centrifuged at 10,000 \u00d7 \ng for 120 s, and the supernatant was transferred to microcentrifuge tubes (Lube Tube; Marsh Co., Rochester NY, USA). The pellet was re-extracted with the same volume of water (35 \u03bcL), and the combined supernatants were stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until they were used. Immediately before use for PCR, the supernatants were incubated at 56 \u00b0C for 5 min and were then centrifuged at 10,000 \u00d7 \ng for 60 s to pellet the residual RNAID from the sample.",

No PCR inhibitors were detected in the extracts, which most often yielded the lowest C\nt values. Although it is the most costly, this method was the most consistent and had relatively low hands-on and hands-off time processing time. Without knowledge of the proprietary components of the kit used with MagNA Pure Compact RNA Isolation kit, the reason for its superior performance cannot be determined. However, a possible explanation is that the method uses silica-coated magnetic beads, and the extraction process includes a DNase treatment step. The easyMAG, miniMAG and KingFisher Flex methods also use magnetic beads but without a DNase treatment step. The C\nt values for extracts obtained using these methods were always higher but the extracts were not found to contain inhibitors of RT-PCR. The easyMAG and miniMAG extraction platforms are total nucleic acid extraction methods, suggesting that DNA in the extracts may have interfered with the extraction process or RT-PCR. The KingFisher Flex is an RNA only extraction method, but without a DNase treatment step the extracted product is likely to be contaminated with DNA. Therefore, the sub-optimal performance of the KingFisher Flex may be a function of the small volume of sample processed (50 \u03bcL) as well as the presence of DNA in the extract.",
