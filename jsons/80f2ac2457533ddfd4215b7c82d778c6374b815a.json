However, this is subject to large ascertainment bias since tests are typically only ordered from symptomatic cases, whereas a large proportion of infected might show little to no symptoms [1, 2] . Non-symptomatic infections can still shed the SARS-CoV-2 virus and are therefore detectable by PCR-based tests. It is therefore possible to test randomly selected individuals to estimate the true disease prevalence in a population. However, if the disease prevalence is low, very little information is garnered from each individual test. Under such situations it can be advantageous to pool individual patient specimens into a single sample [3] . Pooling strategies can be efficient to increase the test capacity and are less wasteful with ingredients required for the reverse transcriptase PCR test.",

It is also possible that false positives can arise from human errors in the lab. In the following, we repeat the above exercise with specificity ( ) set to 0.99. This creates a seemingly paradoxical situation in which higher levels \u03b8 of sample pooling often leads to more precise prevalence estimates. This is because many, in some cases most, pools are positive without actually containing a single true positive sample, leading to inflated estimates of the prevalence. When the level of pooling goes up, the probability that a positive pool contains at least one true positive sample increases, which increases the total precision. is the author/funder, who has granted medRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.",
