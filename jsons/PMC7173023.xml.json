This is demonstrated by a recent publication showing that health care workers have a higher infection rate compared to the normal population.1 In addition, given that anesthesiologists and intensivists care for these patients, they should have basic knowledge of SARS-CoV-2 and the course of COVID-19 to effectively treat these patients and to optimally protect themselves.",
