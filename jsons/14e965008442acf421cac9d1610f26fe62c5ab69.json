We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of vitamin D over early clinical outcome and serum cytokine levels in patients with moderate to severe brain injury. Methods Thirty-five patients with moderate to severe traumatic brain injury who were admitted to the ICU unit were recruited into the study. Subjects were randomly allocated to a treatment regimen comprising either a one-time oral dose of 120,000 IU (two tablets of 60,000 IU each) of vitamin D (n = 20) or 8 mg of saccharide (two tablets of 4 g each) as placebo (n = 15). The main parameters evaluated included duration of mechanical ventilation and ICU stay, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) and cytokine levels (interleukin (IL)-6, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, interferon (IFN)-\u03b3, IL-2).",

An elevation in GCS score by 3.86 units in the vitamin D-treated group with a 0.19-unit descent in the control group was recorded. Duration of mechanical ventilation was reduced in the vitamin D-treated group compared with the control group (4.7 days vs. 8.2 days, p value 0.0001). A noticeable reduction was recorded in inflammatory biomarkers (cytokines) in the vitamin D-treated group (IL-6 p = 0.08, TNF-\u03b1 p = 0.02, IL-2 p = 0.36) with notable elevation in IFN-\u03b3 (p = 0.65) compared to the control group. Conclusion In the acute phase of moderate to severe traumatic brain injury, vitamin D supplementation plays a vital role and has a favourable effect on the consciousness level of patients.

Worldwide each year around 6.2 million people are exposed to TBI.

After treatment, there was a significant rise (p \u2264 0.001) in the level of vitamin D in the intervention group.

These results are in agreement with earlier studies.

Another study by Wei et al., reported that administration of a secosteroid injection showed neuroprotective effects in brain damage in rats by shielding them from oxidative reparation of the brain. This effect is achieved by reducing the free radical damage and preventing apoptosis in damaged neurons [29] .

Both TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 were found to be significantly increased with a decrease in the levels of vitamin D. However, both these cytokines show a direct relationship between insufficient levels and treatment [31] . Our data clearly depicted an elevation of IL-6 levels after TBI in both groups. However, other cytokines were also found to be elevated in the vitamin D-deficient group, with nearly two-or three-fold increases; IL-6 was found to have a fivefold increase 72 h after the traumatic event.

Anti-inflammatory properties Table 3 Comparison of the cytokine levels between the two study groups aid in augmenting the amount of blood flow to damaged tissues thereby ameliorating the wound-healing cascade and recovery [32] . As suggested by many studies, vitamin D is capable of inhibiting TNF-\u03b1 gene expression. A study with an animal model of multiple sclerosis showed that the combination of glatiramer acetate (GA) and vitamin D had favourable effects on neuronal survival and axonal growth through reduced reactive oxygen species generation and a reduction in the nuclear factor kappa light-chain enhancer of activated B cells (NFkB) [33] . The ultimate goal of TBI research is to prevent, diagnose and treat TBI by avoiding secondary brain insult. Several important aspects need to be understood, including the mechanism through which the primary injury initiates the secondary injury and the sensitivity/specificity of different biomarkers to injury severity. In addition, identifying and evaluating novel targets for pharmacological protection and developing reliable extrapolation methods to predict pharmacological responses in humans are necessary. Despite advances in research and development, healthcare costs associated with TBI are escalating by billions of dollars [34] , thus identifying novel pharmacological strategies that effectively restrain and manipulate the evolution of injury pathways are a primary research focus for addressing the immediate need for better TBI treatments. Furthermore, the precise path of secondary injury progression, i.e., the trajectory of injury and its dynamic progression in the human brain, remains unknown. This non-deterministic nature of the injury trajectory limits the design of rational TBI pharmacotherapies; consequently, clinical trials have failed to demonstrate the efficacy of treatments. This lack of success is likely attributed to several factors, including the complexity and heterogeneity of TBI pathophysiology; the choice of drugs, dosages, delivery routes, dosing regimens, and/ or treatment durations; and an incomplete understanding of the pharmacokinetics (PK), dose-response relationships and therapeutic windows [35] . Therefore, there is currently no 'magic bullet' for delaying the progression of secondary injury.",

In order to control the confounding effect of underlying mental illness and/or internal organ injury on the clinical outcome of TBI, we excluded these patients from our study. The other probable causes of confounding include haematologic and metabolic impairment, which in turn may affect the clinical outcome in the patients with traumatic brain insult. However, statistical analysis revealed that prevalence of these parameters was not significant and may not serve as a confounding source.",
