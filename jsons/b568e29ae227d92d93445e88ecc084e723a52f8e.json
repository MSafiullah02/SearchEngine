EV D68 positive child aged two years and presented with asthma like symptoms for which he was admitted to ICU. The child tested negative for Influenza, RSV, Rhinovirus, PIV, hMPV and adenovirus, on real time RT-PCR. And on NGS full EV D68 genome was retrieved belonging to sub-clade B3. In ICU, child received anti-bacterial and anti-viral therapy. The child recovered with-out any sequelae and was discharged one week later.

In 2014 [August-October], the largest and most widespread outbreak of EV-D68 associated with severe acute respiratory illness (SARI) occurred in North America, affecting over 1153 people in 49 states and 14 deaths [3, 4] .
