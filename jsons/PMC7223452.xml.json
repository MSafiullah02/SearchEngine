Many different kinds of bacteria can result in people\u2019s illness and even death. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), there are more than 2.1 billion people lack safe drinking water [1], provoking people to seek sterilization materials to settle this problem. Up to now, various antibiotics, metabolic inhibitors and bactericides have been employed to kill bacteria. However, it is found that the widely uses of sterilization materials will bring about some tricky problems, including producing the antibiotic-resistant bacteria and leading to environmental pollution, greatly limiting their applications. Therefore, an effective and new sterilization material is still required.",

Moreover, TiO2 itself had advantageous properties including safety, insoluble in water and highly chemical stability [3], which implied it was an excellent choice for water treatment. Further researches were conducted to explore its photocatalytic sterilization activity and mechanism, and TiO2 was verified that it could transfer toxic and non-biodegradable organic pollutants into small molecules such as water and carbon dioxide by photocatalytic oxidation [4]. It was notable that many researches manifested TiO2 also had superior sterilization performance against many bacteria, including Staphylococcus aureus, Aspergillus niger, Bacillus atrophaeus, Giardia lamblia and etc. [5]. For instance, the sterilization efficiency of TiO2 for Staphylococcus aureus could reach 93% irradiated by UV light for 30 min [6], while its was up to 97% for Giardia lamblia under UV light irradiation for an hour [7], showing that TiO2 possessed broad and efficiency sterilization activity, which was beneficial to apply in actual drinking water treatment to deal with different bacteria.",

            "text": "With so many superior advantages described above, TiO2 was considered as an excellent potential material to deal with microbial contamination problems. However, there was a big obstacle in actual application which the surface area, free energy and binding energy of the TiO2 catalyst substantially increasing when the crystal size decreasing, making the catalyst agglomerate and eventually leading to the unsatisfied photocatalytic effect [8]. Therefore, the dispersion of TiO2 was expected to overcome. It was reported that the element doping [9], noble metal loading [10], semiconductor compounding [11] and surface modification by organic compounds were useful to tackle this problem [12]. Especially, the surface modification of TiO2 enhancing its surface acidity, was a feasible way to improve its photocatalytic activity. The reason was that the concentration of Ti3+ and the adsorption concentration of O2\u2212, O \u2212 on the TiO2 surface would reduce, while the oxygen defect sites would increase after modified by acid [13]. As a result, it could effectively hinder the electron\u2013hole recombination and improve TiO2 photocatalytic activity. It was obvious that modification by strong acid greatly improved TiO2 photocatalytic activity, for example, the photocatalytic activity of SO42\u2212/TiO2 was 2\u201310 times higher than that of TiO2 at the same reaction conditions [14]. Nevertheless, TiO2 modified by strong acid was unsuitable to apply in drinking water treatment due to its high toxicity and researchers turned to try using weak acid to modify it. Compared with the pure TiO2, TiO2 modified by surfactants oleic acid had higher photocatalytic activity and could degrade methylene blue efficiently even at low concentration [12]. Besides, the TiO2-stabilized Pickering emulsion, which was successfully modified by salicylic acid, provided a new way to the degradation of insoluble organic pollutants [15]. These results indicated that weak acid could also effectively modify TiO2 to increase its photocatalytic activity. Hence, the surface modification by the lower nontoxic weak acid was probably a feasible way to increase the photocatalytic sterilization activity of TiO2, which was suitable to apply in water treatment.",

Besides, the absorption band of the composite at 1634 cm\u22121 was sharp assigned to the C=C bonds from two different sources, including the original C=C bonds in SA itself and the broken of C=O bond to form new C=C bond in SA [22].",

The sterilization results of E. coli exposed to the as-prepared samples following 60 min treatment in a reactor containing the composite of 0.1 g L\u22121 under UV irradiation was shown in Fig. 7. It was found that the sterilization efficiency of SA/TiO2 increased with the increasing of the molar ratio of SA adding from 0.01 to 0.05, while the further increasing the molar ratio of SA to 0.15, the sterilization activity of SA/TiO2 decreased, indicating one of the best sterilization activity parameters was n(Ti):n(SA) = 1:0.05. The reason was that TiO2 would decrease particle sizes and increase the specific surface area after modified by SA, ultimately enlarging the contact area between the catalyst and the bacteria suspension. However, adding little SA could not greatly interact with the agglomerated TiO2, while excessive SA would coat on TiO2 surface failing to increase the dispersion of TiO2. Consequently, the optimum parameters of n (Ti): n (SA) = 1:0.05 was determined.",

The curve in Fig. 8 showed the effect of the different in situ water content on the sterilization performance of the composite and the inactivation efficiency tendency of the composite was increasing firstly and then decreasing. When the ethanol volume was 60 mL, the catalyst showed its excellent sterilization activity. The interpretation for the tendency of inactivation performance was that Ti precursor failed to fully hydrolyze with little in situ water, and then the increasing of in situ water content accelerated the hydrolysis of tetrabutyl titanate, forming TiO2 particles with small sizes and large specific surface area [23], thus greatly enhancing the sterilization activity of the catalyst. However, when the in situ water content was over 60 mL, due to the excessive water dilution, resulting in the viscosity of TiO2 sol, the crosslinking degree and polymerization degree of the polycondensate would significantly decrease, which hindered the crystal to the form complete structure in the subsequently solvothermal reaction [24]. Moreover, the reactants volume had greatly effect on the reactor filling degree and also affected the sterilization performance of the composite [25]. The low composite volume exhibited poor crystallinity for the low reactor filling degree at low reaction pressure. On the contrary, excessive volume composite showed too fast growth rate at high pressure. Therefore, the ethanol volume of 60 mL and the acetic acid volume of 40 mL were selected for further research.",

With the increasing of hydrothermal temperature, it provided more energy for the crystal growth and accelerated the phase transformation of TiO2 from rutile to anatase phase [27]. However, the fast supersaturation and crystallization rate might lead to the abnormal growth of the catalyst at too high hydrothermal reaction temperature [28], and the synthesized powders were prone to agglomeration, decreasing the specific surface area of the crystals.

It turned out that the composite obtained in a short time was noncrystalline with TiO2 particles obviously aggregation. Besides, less photogenerated electrons would be excited in the unit area of crystals, and the diffusion distance from the internal to surface would increase [29, 30], which decreased photocatalytic activity of the composite. As the hydrothermal time increasing, the catalyst continuously would grow having better crystallization and the crystal particles distributed more uniformly [31]. However, when the hydrothermal reaction time was over 12 h, due to the gradually increasing of particles size, the defects on the crystal surface and the active sites decreased, resulting in the gradually decreasing of sterilization activity. Especially, when the hydrothermal reaction time was more than 24 h, the sterilization effect of the catalyst obvious rapidly decreased, for the overgrown crystals mutual extrude and engulf forming the uneven sizes.

The catalyst exhibited its best sterilization activity adding SA/TiO2 to 1.0 g L\u22121. When the catalyst dosage was less than 1.0 g L\u22121, the log reduction increased rapidly due to the increasing contact area between the catalyst and bacteria, which created more active sites in the catalyst. Meanwhile, the ultraviolet utilization efficiency increased releasing more oxidizing groups [32], rapidly increasing the sterilization effect of the catalyst. Nevertheless, the log reduction would decrease when the catalyst dosage was more than 1.0 g L\u22121, for the catalyst concentration gradually increased and the bacteria suspension turbidity correspondingly increased, sheltering the light and reducing the transmittance of the solutions [33]. As a result, some catalysts away from the light source could not be stimulated by the UV light. On the other hand, the increasing of catalyst concentrations made some catalyst particles agglomerate each other [34], and the electron hole pairs were easy to recombine, which weakened the sterilization properties of the catalyst. The log reduction of E. coli reached 4.41 log at the catalyst dosage of 1.0 g L\u22121, compared to 0.7 g L\u22121 only 0.1 log higher.

The effects of different irradiation time on the sterilization properties of SA/TiO2 were investigated under ultraviolet lamp irradiated for 10, 20, 30, 60, 90 and 120 min, respectively. The results were shown in Fig. 12, it depicted that the log reduction of E. coli increased rapidly from 1.45 to 3.41 log at the irradiation time from 10 to 30 min, however, it increased slowly in 30 to 60 min. Irradiated by the continuous UV light, the increasing light quantum numbers provided more energy for the electronic excitation process of the catalyst, helpful for the oxidation groups to participate in the sterilization process. However, per unit volume of the catalyst content in the bacteria suspensions was fixed so that the formation efficiency of the electron\u2013hole pairs gradually decreased when the radiation time reached 30 min. The increasing tendency of the log reduction of E. coli was quite slowly when the radiation time exceeded 60 min, due to the limitation of bacteria numbers. In short, the inactivation efficiency was relatively efficient when the radiation time was 60 min and the catalyst showed excellent sterilization performance at this condition.",

As a representative compound of DOM, humic acid (HA) had been widely used to evaluate the effect of natural organic matter on the environmental geochemical processes [35]. HA was a major component of humic substances coming from the decomposition of plants and animal [36], and it belonged to a kind of chemically heterogeneous compound containing abundant functional groups such as phenolic, hydroxyl, and carboxyl. Some research showed that HA could be absorbed on the nanomaterials surface, and the functional groups of HA such as carboxylate and phenolic had a strong complexation effect probably affecting the photocatalytic performance of the nanomaterials [37]. Therefore, the disinfection of pathogens in water might be affected by HA and it was still urgent to investigate the effect of HA on SA/TiO2. The HA concentration in the typical surface water was about 10 mg L\u22121 [38]. In this work, the effect of different HA concentrations in the range of 3\u201318 mg L\u22121 on the disinfection performance of E. coli cells were investigated. As shown in Fig. 13, the increasing of HA concentrations would decrease the disinfection efficiency and the decreasing tendency became obviously when the concentration reached 18 mg L\u22121. The sterilization performance of the composite was slightly affected by the concentrations of HA which generally below 10 mg L\u22121 in actual water sources.",

The results indicated that the composite presented regularly spherical particles with the size of 50 nm and excellent dispersion.

The addition of SA made the band gap of TiO2 slightly increased from 3.03 to 3.35 eV, implying the composite showed strongly response to the UV light. The optimum preparation parameters of the catalyst were n(Ti):n(SA) = 1:0.05, 60 mL ethanol and 40 mL glacial acetic acid at the hydrothermal temperature of 180 \u2103 for 12 h. The composite (0.7 g L\u22121) showed excellent photocatalytic sterilization performance, which could reach the log reduction of E. coli to 4.31 log under the UV light irradiation for 60 min. In a word, SA/TiO2 provided a new path to hinder the agglomeration of TiO2 nanoparticles by enhancing TiO2 surface acidity, thus achieving a safe and effective drinking water disinfection method.",
