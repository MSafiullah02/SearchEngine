The diagnoses of all patients were confirmed by a positive RT-PCR test for SARS-CoV RNA or anti-SARS-CoV antibody serologic test. The clinical pictures of this cohort of patients were similar to those reported in the literature. Most patients (87%) had abnormal chest radiographs on admission, and some (13%) presented early such that high-resolution thoracic computer tomography (CT) scanning was required to confirm the presence of pulmonary involvement. Patients were initially managed with broad-spectrum antibiotics and supportive therapy. After the diagnosis of clinical SARS was made and if there was no response to antibiotic therapy, combination therapy with ribavirin (400 mg intravenously every 8 h) and systemic steroids [intravenous hydrocortisone (200 mg) every 6\u20138 h or intravenous methylprednisolone (3 mg \u00b7 kg\u22121 \u00b7 day\u22121)] was initiated. The latter would be continued in a tailing manner for a total of 21 days. Intravenous pulse methylprednisolone, in a daily dose of 500 mg to 1 g for 2\u20133 days, would be initiated when the clinical condition, radiologic presentation, or oxygen saturation status deteriorated (at least for two of the three). The clinical characteristics, detailed management plan, and treatment regimen of this cohort of patients were described in a previous publication (2).",

Briefly, the frontal chest x-ray radiograph was divided into six lung zones (left upper zone, left middle zone, left lower zone, right upper zone, right middle zone, and right lower zone), with the upper zone representing the area above the carina (including the apex), the middle zone from the carina to the level of inferior pulmonary veins, and the lower zone from the lower margin of the middle zone to the lung base.

Sera were then removed from the \u221270 \u00b0C freezer and thawed, and 20 \u03bcL of each serum was denatured by adding 30 \u03bcL of 50 mmol/L Tris-HCl buffer containing 9 mol/L urea and 20 g/L CHAPS with vortex-mixing for 20 min at 4 \u00b0C. This sample mixture was then loaded in each well of the filter plate, and 50 \u03bcL of 1 mol/L urea buffer was added. The plate was shaken on an orbital shaker for 30 min at 4 \u00b0C and centrifuged, with a collection plate placed underneath, at 300g for 1 min to collect the flow-through fraction. We then added 100 \u03bcL of 50 mmol/L Tris-HCl buffer containing 1 g/L N-octyl-\u03b2-d-glucopyranoside (OGP) at pH 9 (pH 9 washing buffer) to the plate and rinsed the resin under vigorous vortex-mixing on an orbital shaker for 10 min; the rinse was then collected by centrifugation and mixed together with the previously flow-through fraction. Fractionation was then repeated similarly with a pH 7 washing buffer (100 mmol/L sodium phosphate containing 1 g/L OGP at pH 7), a pH 5 washing buffer (100 mmol/L sodium acetate containing 1 g/L OGP at pH 5), a pH 4 washing buffer (100 mmol/L sodium acetate containing 1 g/L OGP at pH 4), a pH 3 washing buffer (50 mmol/L sodium citrate containing 1 g/L OGP at pH 3), and finally an organic washing buffer (333 mL/L isopropanol, 167 mL/L acetonitrile, and 1 mL/L trifluoroacetic acid). The six resulting serum anion-exchange fractions (F1\u2013F6, representing the flow-through fraction at pH 9; the fractions at pH 7, pH 5, pH 4, and pH 3; and the organic fraction, respectively) were frozen at \u221270 \u00b0C until chip binding was initiated.",

A pretreatment step is required for IMAC Cu(II) chips but not for CM10 chips. Briefly, the IMAC Cu(II) chips were loaded on a bioprocessor, and to each spot of the chips was added 50 \u03bcL of 100 mmol/L CuSO4 buffer. The chips were vortex-mixed vigorously and rinsed with distilled water, after which 50 \u03bcL of 100 mmol/L sodium acetate buffer was added to the chips with strong vortex-mixing to remove the unbound copper. The chips were then rinsed with water and equilibrated with a chip binding buffer (100 mmol/L sodium phosphate buffer, pH 7, containing 0.5 mol/L NaCl). We added 80 and 90 \u03bcL of the chip binding buffer to each spot of the IMAC Cu(II) and CM10 chips, respectively; we then added 20 and 10 \u03bcL of the serum fraction to the IMAC Cu(II) and CM10 chips, respectively, followed by vigorous vortex-mixing for 30 min at room temperature. The chips were then washed twice with 150 \u03bcL of the chip binding buffer with vortex-mixing for 5 min each. They were then washed twice with 200 \u03bcL of distilled water. One microliter of an energy-absorbing molecule, sinapinic acid in 500 mL/L acetonitrile\u20135 mL/L trifluoroacetic acid, was applied twice to each spot, with the chip being air-dried for 10 min between applications. The chips were read in a Protein Biological System IIc mass spectrometer reader (Ciphergen Biosystems Incorporation), and the time-of-flight spectra were generated by, on average, 338 laser shots per sample. Mass accuracy was calibrated externally by use of the All-in-1 peptide molecular mass standard (Ciphergen Biosystems Incorporation).

The peaks were baseline-subtracted, calibrated on mass accuracy, detected, and clustered automatically by the analysis software. In the Biomarker Wizard mode, the normalized peak height (or intensity) of each peak detected in sera from SARS patients was compared with that in the control groups by a nonparametric two-sample Mann\u2013Whitney U-test (13) to identify the peaks that were significantly increased or decreased in SARS patients. Briefly, this was done by operation in two passes with the first pass detecting major well-defined peaks that were different between the SARS and control groups and the second pass defining the remaining small peaks that differed between the groups, using a criterion of a twofold or greater difference in peak height after data normalization in the two groups. The normalized peak intensities in the SARS patients with longitudinal follow-up were also correlated with the chest x-ray opacity score and other clinical manifestations.",

The bound proteins were eluted by boiling in sample loading buffer for sodium dodecyl sulfate\u2013polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The eluted antigens were then resolved by SDS-PAGE in a 4\u201312% gradient gel (NuPAGE; Invitrogen), and a protein band at \u223c11.6 kDa in the gel was excised (14). This protein band was then subjected to overnight tryptic digestion in a reaction volume of 20 \u03bcL of 50 mmol/L ammonium bicarbonate buffer, pH 8.0, containing 1 pmole of trypsin (15). Subsequently, 2 \u03bcL of the digestion mixture was analyzed on a Normal Phase ProteinChip Array (NP20). \u03b1-Cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid (Ciphergen Biosystems) was used to facilitate desorption/ionization of the peptides generated from the tryptic digest. The masses of the tryptic digested peptides were measured by the ProteinChip Reader and were used for initial protein identification from the Profound database available on the internet http://prowl.rockefeller.edu/. The identity of the protein was further confirmed by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) fragmentation analysis of five major peptides (at molecular masses of 1455.8, 1550.8, 1611.9, 1640.9, and 1941.1 Da) generated from the tryptic digest on a ABI Q-Star\u2122 quadrupole tandem mass spectrometer equipped with a Ciphergen ProteinChip Interface (PCI-1000) as described previously (16). Fragmentation of each peptide generated a set of MS/MS ion fingerprint, which was then entered into a mass spectrometry database search engine, Mascot (http://www.matrixscience.com/), to find the closest match with known proteins as reported previously (17). A probability-based Mowse score >33 thus generated indicates that the MS/MS ion profile matched with good homology a known protein in the database with a P value <0.05, whereas a score of 90 represents matching with a known protein with almost absolute identity.",

The CVs of the mean intensities of various peaks on IMAC Cu(II) chips and CM10 chips were determined.

CM10 chips had relatively higher variabilities, with chip-to-chip CVs of 9\u201324% and spot-to-spot CVs of 8\u201326%.

SAA had a matching probability of 1, with the second choice, a human hypothetical protein (XP_299056), having a probability of 8.9 \u00d7 10\u22126.

The consolidation usually clears quickly, but a small proportion of patients progress to bilateral consolidation with extensive pneumonic involvement and protracted clinical course (7). Serial chest radiographs are helpful in the diagnosis and monitoring of the clinical course (6)(7), but their interpretation can be confounded by a lack of available experienced radiologists, by interobserver variability, and by the frequently suboptimal quality of portable films taken in isolation wards to avoid the spread of infections to other patients.",

However, its use in monitoring the disease is probably limited or at least unclear because the lung damage in SARS appears to be more related to immunopathologic consequences of host response than to virus replication (22). It has also been suggested that lymphopenia or T-cell lymphopenia, a fairly common occurrence in SARS patients (24)(25), might potentially be a marker for disease activity.

A large number of samples can also be processed within a short period of time. SELDI-TOF MS, or protein chip profiling, has further advanced the technology by combining mass spectrometry with a surface-enhanced biochip, which allows uniform and reproducible binding and desorption of biomarkers so that quantitative comparison of individually resolved biomarkers in serially monitored patients is possible (8)(10). Using this profiling technology, we found at least 12 serum biomarkers that were differentially increased or decreased in SARS patients. Among them, an acute-phase protein, SAA, was substantially increased in 44 sera from 24 SARS patients, in contrast to 72 sera from 51 control patients with different viral or bacterial infections. Using a clinically useful chest radiographic score, we found that the SAA concentration correlated well with the extent of pneumonia in four patients for whom serial serum samples were available. In the first two patients, this protein was increased, similar to the increase in radiographic score in the active phase of the disease within the first 2 weeks of symptom onset. The slightly earlier peaks in SAA concentrations compared with the radiographic scores could perhaps indicate that SAA might be an earlier marker in disease activity, although this requires further validation. In the third patient, who had a milder disease course and lesser extent of pneumonic involvement, SAA concentrations remained relatively low throughout, indicating that this biomarker correlates well with the severity of disease.",

The increase has been found to be more prominent in some bacterial infections than in non-SARS-CoV viral infections (30). Hence, it is not surprising that the fourth patient demonstrated an increase in SAA concentration in the near-terminal part of her illness when there were superimposed bacterial infections, followed by a slight decrease after antibiotics were initiated. This increase was probably additional to the persistent SARS-CoV infection, as demonstrated by the persistently positive RT-PCR results for samples from various sources and her continuous severe radiologic abnormalities. Such an increase in SAA was, however, in contrast to the low concentrations of this protein in the tested control viral and bacterial infections (Figs. 2 and 3 ) and probably was a result of the severity of multiple superimposed infections and septicemia in this patient. Secondary severe bacterial infection, which can cause high mortality, is not uncommon in SARS patients with pneumonia; therefore, increased SAA concentrations in the presence of severe secondary infections in SARS patients could be an advantage rather than a disadvantage if the aim is to monitor patients for severity of disease.",

A study of feline disease conditions also showed that SAA was the earliest marker induced when compared with \u03b11-acid glycoprotein, haptoglobulin, and C-reactive protein (35). This lends support to the possibility that SAA might also manifest earlier than the radiographic score, although this remains to be confirmed in subsequent studies.",

As far as the SARS-CoV infection is concerned, the major mortality-causing symptom is pneumonia; therefore, the discovery of acute-phase proteins that are strongly associated with pneumonia-related inflammatory events is expected and entirely matches with the theme of this study in pneumonia monitoring. Although the individual acute-phase proteins detected in this study may not be absolutely specific to SARS-CoV infection per se, our preliminary data showed that the SELDI analysis showing a distinctive pattern of increase and decrease of these proteins and their variants can distinguish SARS from other infectious respiratory diseases very well (data not shown).",

Pulmonary infiltrates and acute-phase diffuse alveolar damage were frequently found in the SARS patients (39)(40). It is also widely known that such infiltrates and diffuse alveolar damage can serve as stimuli for the production and secretion of a variety of inflammatory cytokines. SARS patients have been shown to have markedly increased plasma concentrations of two inflammatory cytokines, interleukin-1 (IL-1) and IL-6 (41). Knowing that IL-1 and IL-6 can rapidly induce 1000-fold increases in SAA in a synergistic manner (42), it thus perhaps explains the possible rapid induction of this acute-phase reactant at the time of SARS CoV infection. With the encouraging correlation of SAA concentration with the extent of pneumonia and the possible correlation of increases or decreases in the remaining serum biomarkers with disease conditions as well, SAA and probably the other biomarkers discussed could be used to monitor disease activity and response to treatment in SARS patients.",
