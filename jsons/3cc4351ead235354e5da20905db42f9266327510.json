Since its emergence, COVID-19 has spread to over 100 countries, sickening about 170,000 people and killing about 6500 as of March 16th, 2020 [1] . COVID-19 is characterized by fevers, malaise, and dry cough which can progress to pneumonia. It is significantly more infectious and pathogenic than seasonal flu, with an estimated case fatality rate of 0.5-3% and approximately 5% of diagnosed patients requiring critical care [2, 3] . Disease severity is associated with advanced age and comorbidities [4, 5] . Regions heavily affected, including northern Italy and Wuhan, China, have faced significant challenges to health system capacity, particularly with respect to intensive care. At present, sustained community transmission of COVID-19 is occurring in many areas worldwide, including the United States. Public health efforts are oriented towards mitigation and limiting the rate of spread to prevent overextension of available healthcare resources such as ventilators [3] .",

This is particularly true of consultation-liaison psychiatrists, who possess expertise at working individually, institutionally, and systemically at the intersection of mental and physical health. Given the unprecedented scope of COVID-19, operationalizing the potential roles of psychiatrists in general, and CL psychiatrists in particular, is essential for a coordinated response. Here we set out potential key roles of CL psychiatrists in the context of COVID-19 and future epidemic/pandemic scenarios, and use our experience at a COVID-affected medical center to identify and problemsolve challenges in filling those roles.",

Perhaps most acutely, for patients affected by COVID-19, our ability to control mental health comorbidities and manage behavioral agitation in conditions like delirium may be key for maximizing the number of patients able to receive high quality medical care. Patients in the ICU or hospital ward setting who are behaviorally dysregulated require disproportionately high workforce and resource investments. In epidemic scenarios, poorly managed psychotic or delirious patients may literally preclude stretched-thin staff from caring for other people in need. Aggressive management of behavioral dysregulation and high-quality care of underlying psychiatric disorders even in the setting of comorbid infection is key to improving both individual and communal outcomes. To minimize exposure and mitigate the loss of workforce to quarantines, psychiatric consultation can be done through video platforms as well as in person.",

During the Ebola outbreak of 2018, patients under treatment were noted to have significant distress from the effects of isolation, the fear of dying (especially as other patients perished from the illness), and the sense of social rejection. In the Ebola treatment center in Beni, Democratic Republic of Congo, in 2018, patients were visited by psychologists multiple times daily to help mitigate distress [10] . This distress may be exacerbated by effects of quarantine, which may in itself may be associated with trauma-related disorders, stress, anger, and mood dysregulation [11] . Psychiatrists should work with the broader healthcare team to ensure infected and quarantined patients have access to appropriate mental health screening and treatment.",

During the Ebola epidemic, mental health professionals even beyond those caring for Ebola patients directly reported overwhelming MH need because of issues like grief and anxiety [12] . Of note, many of the patients we care for in the CL psychiatry setting, including patients with comorbid mental/physical illness, elderly patients, and patients with serious mental illness (SMI), are particularly vulnerable to changes in access to care that may occur during pandemics; psychiatrists in various settings should be aware and actively trying to mitigate lost access to care for high risk patients, while taking steps to avoid risking perpetuation of infection [13] .",

Mental health services were established for health care providers at the frontline of caring for COVID-19 patients including online interventions, a phone hotline, and group activities. However, the team enacting these interventions noted that clinicians were often reluctant to participate in services identified as \"mental health\" interventions. Interviews with staff demonstrated that worry about infecting family and difficulties dealing with uncooperative patients are particularly challenging areas. In response to these concerns, mental health teams created areas for staff to isolate themselves from family. They also assisted staff in creating media messages to send to family to allay worry. Training was established for dealing with uncooperative patients. Other interventions included the presence of mental health clinicians on premises available to staff as needed [19] .",

Pandemic infectious disease stresses systems across a variety of domains.

Our service has found the use of video consultations using smartphones, tablets, or computers particularly helpful. Many patients have such devices. New medical video platforms offer relatively easy-to-use interfaces with quick connectivity that allow for face-to-face remote consultation. Given the deficit of PPE nationally, utilizing video consultation is also of benefit to the system and this is reflected in changes in billing and compliance rules to facilitate such consultative models during the epidemic.

Our approach to combating this lack of understanding is twofold: first, to work assiduously as a service to respond to the needs of our patients, institution, and community. Second, to document, operationalize, and share the multifaceted work that we find ourselves called to do at every stage of the pandemic/epidemic response.

But working as a community of clinicians and researchers, we can strive to meet the needs on the individual, institutional, and societal level.
