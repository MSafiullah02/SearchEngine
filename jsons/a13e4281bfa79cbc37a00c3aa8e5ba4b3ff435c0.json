In this document, we describe the estimator we are using which was developed in (Fraser; 2007), derive its asymptotic properties, and we give details on its implementation. Furthermore, we validate the estimator on simulated data, demonstrate that estimates on real data lead to plausible results, and perform a sensitivity analysis.

This raises important questions for policymakers and public health specialists. How large is the effect of these measures? Do they effectively stop the spread of COVID-19? What will happen if restrictions get relaxed? And in the future, how can we see whether the epidemic is getting out of hands again?",

When comparing the results with the ones obtained using the infectivity profile modelled in Section 3 (see Figure 1 ), one observes that the former profile has a longer tail, so the estimator takes values from further in the past into account, which for increasing case numbers reduces the denominator in Equation (5), and hence somewhat increases the estimates. Once case numbers stabilise, this effect obviously vanishes. As with the data source, the influence of the infectivity profile appears to be small enough not to matter qualitatively.",

(Obadia et al.; 2012) . In fact, the latter models are implicitly based on the assumption that conditions do not change such that the epidemic spreads with a constant growth rate, and thus with a constant reproduction number. But here we aim to determine a varying reproduction number. Fitting exponential growth models to total case numbers therefore is not conducive, even when localising the procedure by considering short time windows. Indeed, the case numbers from the past which occurred under different conditions will always affect the estimates. This problem is alleviated when exponential growth models are fitted locally to the numbers of new cases. Still, one needs to assume that conditions change slowly -which is debatable for the drastic measures which have been implemented quickly. In any case, even if one could observe new infections directly, the resulting estimates would be (additionally) smoothened, as opposed to the unbiased, sharp results obtained for the estimator we consider here (cf. Figure 4) .",

Changes in the reporting or testing methodology, however, will affect the estimates, as they will be indistinguishable from a true increase or decrease in the number of infections. This will for example happen if more people are tested due to higher capacities in testing facilities, or if lower case numbers allow more extensive tests of potential contacts, or if deaths are attributed to the disease without testing when such capacities are exhausted.

For some of the data provided by the Robert Koch-Institut (2020), both the reporting date, and the day of symptom onset are known, which in principle allows to infer dates of symptom onset for the entire dataset, thus getting rid of the weekday's influence.
