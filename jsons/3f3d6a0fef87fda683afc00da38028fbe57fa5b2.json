Current preoperative clinical risk assessment strategies have poor accuracy for identifying patients who will sustain adverse events following heart surgery. There is an ongoing need to integrate clinical variables with novel technology and biomarkers to accurately predict outcome following pediatric heart surgery. We tested whether preoperative levels of miRNAs-208a can serve as such a biomarker. Serum samples were obtained from pediatric patients immediately before heart surgery. MiRNA-208a was quantified by RQ-PCR. Correlations between the patient's clinical variables and miRNA levels were tested. Lower levels of preoperative miRNA-208a correlated with and could predict the appearance of postoperative cardiac and inflammatory complications. MiRNA-208a may serve as a biomarker for the prediction of patients who are at risk to develop complications following surgery for the repair of congenital heart defects.",

A number of clinical risk indices have been developed, but their predictive power is limited [2] , raising the need for a simple and strongly predictive noninvasive alternative. MiRNAs are a class of noncoding RNAs of approximately 22 nucleotides in length that was shown to be useful biomarkers in various diseases. The posttranslational regulatory roles of miRNAs have been demonstrated in almost all physiological processes. Unlike other extracellular RNA molecules, extracellular miRNAs are remarkably stable in serum and, together with their tissue specificity and the ease by which they can be detected and quantified, they have sparked great interest in their use as clinical biomarkers for a wide range of medical states [3] . We had reported that the level of circulating cardiac miRNA-208a following surgery can serve as a sensitive biomarker for the postoperative course of pediatric patients with CHD undergoing heart surgery for the repair of their defect [4] . In the present study, we hypothesized that preoperative miRNA-208a levels in the blood of pediatric patients with CHD can predict postoperative complications.",

The inclusion criteria were age younger than 21 years and an echocardiographic diagnosis of CHD that required cardiac surgery. The laboratory parameters assessed in the study were as follows: troponin at 24 h after surgery, lactate at 0 h, 6 h, 12 h, 24 h, and maximal lactate after surgery, and maximal creatinine, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels measured during the hospitalization period. The preoperatively measured parameters were Aristotle score [5] , invasive or noninvasive ventilator support, oxygen saturation levels, and whether the surgery was elective or nonelective. The surgical parameters were the cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and aortic crossclamp (ACC) times. The postoperative parameters were invasive and noninvasive ventilator support, length of ventilation, length of hospitalization (LOH), need for reintubation, need for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), maximal inotropic support, and number of days during which inotropic support was given. These parameters were divided into two groups in order to examine correlations. The first group contained the parameters that were related to the LOH (i.e., invasive and noninvasive ventilation days and the total number of hospitalization days), and they did not account for children who died following surgery. The second group contained all the other parameters and accounted for all the children in the study.",

Patients with higher postoperative lactate values had lower preoperative miRNA-208a levels. This result supports the ability of preoperative miRNA-208a levels to predict the patient's postoperative outcome. It is also worth noting that dividing this group of patients according to their LOH (more or less than the median of 8 days) yielded a substantial, although not significant, difference in the amount of preoperative miRNA-208a: specifically, children with a shorter LOH had 2.7 times more miRNA-208a in serum before their operation than those with longer LOHs.",

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to identify a miRNA which can serve as a single preoperative biomarker effective in predicting the postoperative outcome in this setting. This is a continuation of our previous study in which we identified that circulating miRNA-208a can serve as an accurate biomarker for predicting the risk of developing postoperative complications 6 h following surgery: high levels of miRNA-208a in the serum several hours after surgery were indicative of complications which increased the risk of sustaining a worse outcome [4] .",

Accurate preoperative risk assessment at an individual patient level enhances clinical decision-making of postoperative patient management and the estimation of associated risks. To date, preoperative prediction of the postoperative course involves the use of the Aristotle score which takes into account the complexity of the surgical procedure and predicts 30-day mortality and LOH during the first postoperative week. In addition, recent papers have shown the potential benefit of preoperative ST2 levels to identify children with increased risk of mortality or readmission after pediatric heart surgery [6, 7] . We were intrigued by the possibility that miRNA-208a could also serve as a preoperative biomarker for the child's potential sequelae. Our results indeed showed that high expression levels of preoperative circulating miRNA-208a were predictive of a better postoperative outcome, as reflected by fewer complications following surgery and, accordingly, were correlated with a low Aristotle score and a shorter LOH. We hypothesized that the elevated miRNA-208a found in the sera of patients before the operation was secondary to the presence of a disturbance in normal physiology and that such patients benefited from preconditioning of the heart, thereby leading to a greater likelihood of an uncomplicated postoperative course. The hearts of those patients were \"prepared\" before surgery by a yet to be determined mechanism, which enabled them to cope optimally with the stress caused during and immediately after the operation, with the result of fewer postoperative complications. Our study is not the first to suggest that a beneficial postoperative outcome is seen in patients whose hearts were exposed to preoperative stress. Remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) was found to be clinically effective in a study by Wu et al. on TOF children undergoing open heart surgery [8] . Those authors showed that RIPC attenuated myocardial ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury and improved the short-term prognosis of those patients [8] . Not surprisingly, miRNAs have been reported to mediate such protection of the heart in several studies [9, 10] . The involvement of miRNAs in protective mechanisms has also been described in preconditioning of the brain [11] .",

            "text": "The source of the high levels of circulating miRNA-208a before surgery has yet to be determined. In general, extracellular circulating miRNAs originate from two main sources: they can be merely byproducts of cellular activity and cell death [12] , or they can be the result of a selective export system which enables the secreted miRNA to be transferred to a recipient cell where it can carry out its role [13] . We and others have shown that the presence of miRNA-208a in the blood correlates with damage caused to the heart [4, 14, 15] ; however, there are no studies that define the exact mechanism of the export system. Notably, however, circulating miRNA-208a in the blood could be a trigger for inducing a heartprotective mechanism whose results become evident following surgery in both of the above-mentioned scenarios. A role for miRNA-208a in communicating signals from the heart to other parts of the body has been reported by Feng et al., who found that cardiac miRNA-208a released into the circulation following myocardial I/R is capable of activating innate [16] . We suggest that because the hearts of the children that were subjected to prolonged physiological stress until the date of the operation had the opportunity to be more prepared, and possibly more protected, from the effects of the operation, those children sustained fewer postoperative complications. Although the correlation between the levels of miRNA-208a and the postoperative course was more significant in the cyanotic patients, results pointing in the same direction were also obtained for the non-cyanotic ones. This observation strengthens our position that exposing the heart to abnormal physiological constraints, as could be expected in children with low oxygen saturation, produces a stronger \"signal\" to provoke a protective mechanism, whatever it may be. This is a pilot study which is intended to serve as the basis for a larger investigation designed to examine the value of obtaining preoperative miRNA levels for the purpose of guiding decisions regarding surgery and the postoperative management that will need to be provided for a specific patient. In addition to demonstrating the benefit of having such information, our results suggest that miRNA-208a may serve as a preoperative target for therapy in children with CHD. Increasing its levels in the blood of such patients may trigger the preconditioning of their heart and thus contribute to a smoother postoperative course.",
