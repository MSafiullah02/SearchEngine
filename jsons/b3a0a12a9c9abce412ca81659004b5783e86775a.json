As the structures of KGs are usually sparse, attributes of entities may play an important role in aligning the entities. However, the heterogeneity of the attributes across KGs prevents from accurately embedding and comparing entities. To deal with the issue, we propose to model the interactions between attributes, instead of globally embedding an entity with all the attributes. We further propose a joint framework to merge the alignments inferred from the attributes and the structures. Experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms the state-of-art baselines by up to 38.48% HitRatio@1. The results also demonstrate that our model can infer the alignments between attributes, relationships and values, in addition to entities.",

Other efforts are made to incorporate the attribute triplets in the form of entity, attribute, value to learn the attribute embeddings of entities [9, 11, 12, 15] . For example, JAPE [9] embeds attributes via attributes' concurrence. Wang et al. [12] adopt GCNs to embed entities with the one-hot representations of the attributes. Trsedya et al.

MultiKE [15] map the attribute and structure embeddings into a unified space. However, the issue of the missing attributes or relationships triplets may result in the inaccurate attribute or structure embeddings, which will propagate the errors to the combined embeddings. Besides the above two challenges, most of the existing works [3, 9, 15] only focus on aligning entities, or at most relationships, but ignore attributes and values.

Following this, we firstly find all the aligned attribute pairs of two entities, and then compare its values. Since the number of the attributes are far smaller than that of the values in KGs, we initialize the aligned attributes by the attribute seed pairs and gradually extend them by our joint framework, which will be introduced in the following section. To compare the large number of cross-lingual values, we train a machine translation model and use it to estimate the BLEU score [8] of two cross-lingual values as their similarity. Unfortunately, following the idea, we need to enumerate and invoke the translation model for maximal M attribute pairs for each entity pair, resulting in O(N \u00d7 N \u00d7 M ) time complexity when there are N and N entities in G and G respectively, which is too inefficient to finish within available time.",

What's more, it is unnecessary to compare the values of different attributes. For example, although the attributes \"birthplace\" and \"deathplace\" have the same value \"New York\", they cannot reflect the similarity of two entities. So, we build an attribute mask matrix A to limit the computation within the values of the aligned attributes. Specifically, we prepare a 3-dimension attribute identification matrix A \u2208 R N \u00d7M \u00d7K for G and A \u2208 R N \u00d7M \u00d7K for G , where K denotes the number of the united frequent attributes in G and G . Each row in A or A is an one-hot vector, with an element A mik = 1 if the i-th value of the m-th entity belongs to the k-th attribute, and A mik = 0 otherwise. Note the onehot identification vector depends on the existing aligned attributes, which will be gradually extended with the joint model iteratively. Whenever two attributes are discovered to be aligned, we will unify their identification. For example, when the k-th attribute in G and the t-th attribute in G are aligned, we replace the identification k with t, i.e., any row with A mik = 1 will be changed to A mit = 1. Then we multiply A and A in the same way as Eq. (1) to obtain an attribute mask matrix A \u2208 R N \u00d7N \u00d7M \u00d7M , where each element A mnij = 1 if the i-th value of the m-th entity in G corresponds to the same attribute of the j-th value of the n-th entity in G , and A mnij = 0 otherwise. Then we calculate the element-wise product of V and A, i.e., V A, to get the masked value similarity matrix. Finally, we summarize the similarities of all the M 2 attribute pairs for each entity pair to obtain an entity similarity matrix:",

The scorebased merge strategy (M2) and the rank-based merge strategy (M3) solve the conflicts, thus perform better than M1 (+1.26-2.43% in HR1). M3 avoids comparing the scores of different scales, thus performs better than M2 in most of the metrics. Later, JarKA indicates the proposed model with M3.",

Specifically, we vary the threshold \u03c4 v from 0.6 to 1.0 with interval 0.1 and show the results of JarKA-r on DBP15K-1 FR-EN in Fig. 3(a) . It is shown that when \u03c4 v = 1.0, i.e., #new aligned attributes is 0, the accuracy of entity alignment is significantly hurt. When \u03c4 v < 1.0, with the increase of #new aligned attributes, the accuracy improves and approaches the best when \u03c4 v = 0.8, as the quantity and the quality of the new aligned attributes are well balanced. The threshold \u03c4 r for finding the new aligned relationships is set in the same way. Case Study. We present several cases of the new aligned relationships, attributes and values in different languages by JarKA on DBP15K in Fig. 3(b) . We also show the number of initial and the finally discovered alignments on DBP15K ZH-EN. Most of the newly discovered alignments are high-frequent attributes or relationships. The low-frequent attributes or relationships are difficult to be aligned by the current method and will be studied in the future. We randomly sample 100 final alignments and manually evaluate the accuracy, as their ground truth is not available. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our model. The whole alignments together with the codes are available online 5 .",

We propose an interaction-based attribute model to compare the aligned attributes of entities instead of globally embedding entities. A matrix-based strategy is adopted to accelerate the comparing process. Then we propose a joint framework together with three merge strategies to solve the conflicts of the alignments inferred from the attribute model and the relationship model. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model. In the future, we plan to incorporate the descriptions of entities and the pre-trained cross-lingual language model to enhance our model's performance.",
