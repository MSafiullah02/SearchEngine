            "text": "On December 31, 2019, the Wuhan Health Commission reported about groups of people with pneumonia who were epidemiologically linked to a seafood and live animal market in Wuhan, China. 1 The etiology was identified as a new coronavirus, with a supposed zoonotic origin. The virus has been recently named the coronavirus of severe acute respiratory syndrome type 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the disease has been called Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). 2 So far, there is uncertainty regarding the transmission capacity of the virus. Recent studies show the presence of a high viral load in the oropharynx at early stages of the disease, which increases the concern about the high risk of infectivity during incubation periods or with only mild symptoms. 3 The average incubation period has been estimated to be 5-6 days, with a range of 1-14 days. In over 80% of cases the symptoms of the disease are mild (fever, cough, expectoration, general malaise), while approximately 20% may have serious clinical manifestations (pneumonia and other clinical complications) that require hospital admission. Pregnant women, newborns, the elderly, immunocompromised and patients with comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus, hypertension and cardiovascular disease, are more to be infected by COVID-19, and they are more likely to suffer severe illness that often requires to be admitted to ICU. The impact of COVID-19 on chronic kidney disease has been scantily reported. 4 Current mortality rate in China is 3.9% of the cases confirmed by the lab, which is very similar to that of Spain 3.7% (data as of March 16, 2020) . 5 However, it is still premature to establish the true mortality rate in our country.",

However, related viruses such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) were reported in transplant recipients during previous outbreaks of these viruses. 8, 9 Based on experiences with previous coronaviruses, it is known that any transplant recipient exposed to the virus would become infected in a high percentage of cases; however, less is known about the risk of donor-recipient transmission. The possibility of a donor-derived infection may be influenced by exposure of the donor, the infectivity of individuals during the incubation period and by asymptomatic people. The extent and duration of viremia and the viability of the virus within specific blood or organ compartments would also affect the risk of donor transmission. Therefore, despite the possible negative consequences, temporary interruption of kidney transplantation may be necessary in areas where the virus is being exposed intensively. 10 The current epidemic of COVID-19 in Europe is still in its early stages, and although the acquisition knowledge is increasing rapidly, there are many unknowns for the community in general and particularly for the transplant patients. However, it is imperative to anticipate the potential impact on the transplant population to avoid serious consequences. The recommendations may change as we learn more about the infection.",

There is little evidence regarding the minimization or management pattern of immunosuppression, especially in the kidney transplant population infected by COVID-19. There has been a very short period of time since the appearance of COVID-19 with very limited accumulated experience and the insufficient published scientific evidence. To date, only one case of a patient with COVID-19 pneumonia in a kidney transplant recipient has been published, whose clinical manifestations were similar to those of the population not carrying a kidney transplant. 7 In this case, the triple immunosuppressive therapy that he had received so far was discontinued (prednisone, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) and tacrolimus and starting methylprednisolone at a dose of 40 mg/day plus nonspecific immunoglobulin). In this patient, fever remitted the fifth day after discontinuation of the treatment. Then, at that moment, tacrolimus was restarted at half the dose, although the radiological signs of pneumonia still persisted. Resolution of the clinical and radiological symptoms with a negative microbiological sample for COVID-19 occurred two weeks after the onset of the clinical symptoms, and the previous dose of tacrolimus and MMF were reintroduced. 7 Therefore, given the limited experience accumulated and the high probability of torpid evolution in a short period of time, with the development of multi-organ failure and the need for respiratory support, the immunosuppressive strategy recommended a priori, at least in the most severe cases of kidney transplant patients with COVID-19 pneumonia, should involve the temporary interruption of immunosuppressants and the start of methylprednisolone at low doses between 20 and 40 mg/day, to confer the rapid acquisition of the necessary cellular immunity to control the infection and thus prevent vital complications. Low-dose systemic corticosteroids have several beneficial effect due to their immunomodulatory, anti-inflammatory and vascular properties, which confer immunological protection of the renal allograft 23 ; Corticoids produce inhibition of proinflammatory cytokines, reduction of white blood cell traffic and maintenance of integrity and permeability of the endothelium, thus maintaining homeostasis and controlling dysregulation of the immune system. 23 In less severe cases, an alternative could be the withdrawal of MMF and the reduction of the dose of calcineurin inhibitors, but so far there are no studies that support this strategy. Given the trophism of the virus by the lung tissue, it seems undesirable to use anti-mTOR drugs, at least in patients with pathology of the lower respiratory tract.",
