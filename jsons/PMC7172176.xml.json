They have ten double-stranded RNA segments encapsidated by two layers of proteins. The inner core consists of two major proteins, VP3 and VP7, and three minor proteins, VP1, VP4 and VP6. The VP7 is group-reactive antigen, hence it is used for BTV antibody detection (Huismans and Erasmus, 1981). A number of VP7-specific MAbs have been produced which recognise both linear and conformational epitopes. The MAb 20E9, which recognises conformational epitope (present on the virus surface) is used for BTV diagnosis (Lunt et al., 1988, Eaton et al., 1991). This study describes cloning, selection and characterisation of scFv fragments.",

Both regions show homology with published sequences of mouse antibody genes and contain complementarity-determining regions (CDR). Nucleotide sequences revealed TAG stop codon in the VH coding sequence. From amino acid sequence determination, the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the light chain protein was found to be similar to deduced amino acid sequence from VL chain DNA fragment (Fig. 1).

This is most likely due to \u201cunmasking\u201d of the 20E9 epitope by SDS treatment. Although it is known that the MAb 20E9 can access epitope in native virus (Eaton et al., 1991), exposure of the binding site is limited because VP7 is located beneath the outer capsid.

Comparison of deduced scFv amino acid sequences with the corresponding N-terminal amino acids of 20E9 light chain confirmed its similarity with native MAb. The fact that the functional scFv was expressed indicated that host cell TG1 (which carries a suppresser gene and supports the growth of vectors with amber mutations) was able to read through stop codon found in the VH coding sequence (Maniatis et al., 1982). In-frame stop codons usually result in disruption of gene expression in other systems. However, in phage display system, detection limit is lower and low level of read-through activity can be detected. Suppression of TAG stop codon has been utilised in the design of many phage vectors, including pCANTAB5 since high levels of antibody is known to be toxic to E. coli (Parmley and Smith, 1988, Wilson and Finlay, 1998). Therefore, it may be an advantage to have clones with low levels of scFv on coat protein since such clones probably have growth advantage and could be easily selected. Recently, functional phage clones with in-frame stop codons or out-of-frame gene fusion have been reported (Jacobsson and Frykberg, 1995, Carcamo et al., 1998). This report describes that the in-frame stop codons are also tolerated in phage antibody expression.",

For the light chain, primer-coded amino acid residues at the N-terminus were boxed, and the amino acid sequence determined by direct protein sequencing is given in boldface. The two residues given below the primer-coded sequence represent the primer-introduced difference between the original MAb 20E9 protein sequence and the deduced amino acid sequence of the cloned scFv. Residues corresponding to the complementarity-determining (CDR) regions are shaded and the in-frame TAG stop codon in the VH coding region is underlined. The 20E9 antibody gene fragments were assembled from about 106 hybridoma cells following manufacturer's instructions (Pharmacia, Uppsala).",
