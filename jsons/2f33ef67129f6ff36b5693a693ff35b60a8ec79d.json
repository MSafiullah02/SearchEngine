The performance of a microplate enzyme immunoassay, DETECT-SARS TM , was evaluated for the detection of anti-SARS-CoV IgG antibody. This assay is based on synthetic peptides derived from the nucleocapsid and spike proteins. The results showed that the assay provided a high degree of sensitivity (95.9%) for convalescent serum samples. The level of specificity was close to 90%, and did not show significant variation among different control groups. The high degree of sensitivity together with the high-throughput nature makes it advantageous as a screening assay for studies where handling of a large number of specimens is required.",

A total of 8,098 cases and 774 deaths had been reported to the World Health Organization during the worldwide outbreak, which halted in July 2003 [World Health Organization, 2003a] . The culprit agent is a new coronavirus, SARS-CoV, which is distinct phylogenetically from the three groups of previous known coronaviruses Kuiken et al., 2003; Marra et al., 2003; Peiris et al., 2003b; Poutanen et al., 2003; Rota et al., 2003] . To improve our understanding on this novel devastating human infection, accurate diagnostic tools are indispensable. At present, the availability of high-throughput serological assay for SARS-CoV is still limited. This remains a major hindrance for large-scale epidemiologic study. The evaluation of a commercial assay, DETECT-SARS TM kit (Adaltis, Italia), which is a Conformit\u00e9 Europ\u00e9enne (CE)-marked indirect microplate enzyme immunoassay for the detection of anti-SARS-CoV immunoglobulin (Ig)G antibody from human serum or plasma specimens, is described.",

In the first phase of development of this kit, the amino acid sequences of the nucleocapsid and spike proteins as predicted from the published sequence of SARS-CoV (GenBank Accession number: NC_004718) were first screened for regions showing high indices of hydrophilicity (Kyle-Doolittle index), antigenicity (Jameson-Wolf index), and surface probability (Emini index). As a result, 20 deduced peptides were synthesized chemically using the 9fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (F-MOC) synthesis. These peptides were coated individually on microplates and evaluated for their sensitivity and specificity for detecting anti-SARS-CoV IgG antibodies. A panel consisting of specimens collected from 55 SARS-convalescent patients, 22 patients affected by other respiratory diseases and 200 healthy donors were used to select the most appropriate peptides. Among the 20 peptides tested, one spike peptide close to the N-terminus and two nucleocapsid peptides located respectively at the Nand C-terminus were found to be the best. These three peptides were used in the DETECT-SARS TM kit.",

After a washing step, horseradish peroxidase-labeled goat antibodies specific for human IgG were added. The antigen-antibody complex was then detected by an enzyme substrate added after the second washing step. The results were interpreted according the manufacturer's criteria and were expressed as index values (ratio of absorbance over the cutoff value). Specimens with index values \u00bc 1.0 were regarded as ''reactive'' for anti-SARS-CoV IgG. Index values <0.5 were retested in duplicate. The average index value obtained from the repeat testing was used to classify the status of the specimen. Specimens with an average index remained between 0.5 and 1.0 were regarded as ''equivocal.'' An in-house indirect immunofluorescence assay for anti-SARS-CoV IgG based on virus-infected cells was used as a reference in this study. This assay has been shown to be highly sensitive and specific.

            "text": "The results of this study showed that the DETECT-SARS TM kit had a high degree of sensitivity (95.9%) for detecting anti-SARS-IgG antibody from convalescent blood specimens. In the case of specimens collected during the acute phase of disease (day 7-14), the sensitivity of the assay increased from 20% (day 7) to 75% (day 14); it is worth noting that these numbers are similar to those reported for RT-PCR assays applied on respiratory specimens [Peiris et al., 2003a; Chan et al., 2004b; Tang et al., 2004] . The sensitivity of DETECT-SARS TM kit was found to be within the reported range of other enzyme immunoassays that based on purified virions [Chen et al., 2004a] , whole viral lysate [Tang et al., 2004] , and recombinant proteins [Guan et al., 2004] . The DETECT-SARS TM kit also provided an acceptable specificity close to 90%. There was no significant difference between the reactivity rates of healthy medical students and pneumonia patients, suggesting that nonspecificity was not due to crossreactivity with a pneumonia pathogen. It was found that serum specimens collected from children tended to have a higher chance of showing equivocal or nonspecific reactivity, though it did not reach statistical significance, this observation deserves further investigation. Specimens found reactive by the DETECT-SARS TM kit should be confirmed by another assay with higher specificity.",
