            "text": "Lung transplant recipients present an increased risk for severe complications associated with respiratory infections. We conducted a review of the literature examining the clinical relationship between viral respiratory infection and graft complications. Thirty-four studies describing the clinical impact of influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza, human metapneumovirus, rhinovirus, enterovirus, coronavirus, bocavirus or adenovirus were identified. The detection rate of respiratory viral infection ranged from 1.4% to 60%. Viruses were detected five times more frequently when respiratory symptoms were present [odds ratio (OR) = 4.97; 95% CI = 2.11-11.68]. Based on available observations, we could not observe an association between respiratory viral infection and acute rejection (OR = 1.35; 95% CI = 0.41-4.43). We found a pooled incidence of 18% (9/50) of bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS) in virus-positive cases compared to 11.6% (37/319) in virus-negative cases; however, limited number of BOS events did not allow to confirm the association. Our review confirms a causal relationship between respiratory viruses and respiratory symptoms, but cannot confirm a link between respiratory viruses and acute lung rejection. This is related in part to the heterogeneity and limitations of available studies. The link with BOS needs also to be reassessed in appropriate prospective studies.",

Although most respiratory viral infections cause self-limited upper respiratory diseases, lung transplant recipients (LTRs) are particularly prone to develop complications (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) . This is related to the immunosuppressive therapy that could promote protracted infection, but also to the direct exposure of the graft to the infectious agent together with an impaired mucociliary function and lymphatic drainage, and the absence of cough reflex. Apart from the direct infection-related morbidity, it is commonly accepted that these infections could promote rejection and subsequently lead to bronchiolitis obliterans syndrome (BOS), the main limitation to long-term survival. However, this association is based on reports that have focused mainly on paramyxoviruses or on influenza and adenovirus to a lesser extent (7) . These studies are heterogeneous and have several technical limitations in terms of design, case selection and diagnostic procedures (1, 8) .",

Other respiratory viruses that require mainly molecular assays to be detected were less frequently screened; 41% for rhinovirus (rhinovirus C screened in only one study); 35% for HMpV; 11-24% for the different subtypes of coronaviruses; 18% for enterovirus and 12% for bocavirus. Overall, only 15% of studies screened at least 75% of the 18 respiratory viruses listed in Table 1 . When assessable, the overall detection rate of respiratory viral infection in the screened population varied from 1.4% to 60%. This wide range can be explained in part by the heterogeneity of the population enrolled (asymptomatic cases versus subjects with limited upper respiratory symptoms versus patients hospitalized with complications). Table S1 depicts the prevalence of virus positivity for each individual study and as a pooled prevalence according to diagnostic method, number of viruses screened and sample size. As expected, the virus positivity rate was higher for studies with small sample size using PCR technique and screening for numerous viruses. For example, studies using PCR techniques had a higher detection rate (12.0%) compared to those not using PCR (1.4%). This can be explained in part by the greater number of viruses searched for by PCR techniques (8.4% for studies identifying nine or more viruses; 3.0% for those identifying eight or less viruses).",

Three studies were not suitable for the present analysis, thus leaving 19 studies reporting a total of 267 acute rejection events graded \u2265 A2. In these 19 investigations, the frequency of acute rejections \u2265 A2 ranged between 5.9% and 47.6% (Table S4) . The association with acute rejection can only be estimated by comparing the rate observed in virus-positive cases with the one observed in virus-negative cases; this was available in only four studies (7, 21, 28, 34) . One study suggests a significant positive association (34) , which could not be confirmed in the three others ( Figure 1B) . Overall, we found no statistically significant association between respiratory viruses and acute rejection (OR = 1.35; 95% CI = 0.41-4.43). OB/BOS incidence following respiratory viral infections was reported for a period of time ranging from a few months to 1 year. In 11 studies (32.5%), all except one (1) used either biopsy-proven chronic rejection (defined by the presence of OB) or a sustained FEV 1 decline of 20% according to the International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation guidelines (35) . BOS incidence ( Table 2 ) following a respiratory viral infection ranged from 5.4% to 62.5% in virus-positive cases and was reported in only three studies for virus-negative cases (5, 21, 29) with a rate ranging from 9.1% to 52.9%. Pooled incidence rates of these three studies revealed a BOS incidence of 18% (9/50) in virus-positive cases compared to 11.6% (37/319) in virus-negative cases. The low number of BOS events analyzed in these three investigations limited our ability to provide any meta-analytic summary that could be considered as relevant. Four of the 11 studies (Table 2) provided a statistical analysis testing the potential association with BOS, but two without providing clearly the BOS rate in virus-negative cases. One (17) failed to show any significant association and three (7,12,29) described a significant higher rate of BOS in subjects experiencing a respiratory viral infection.",

Given the concomitant presence of a significant immunosuppression and impaired protective mechanisms of the grafted lung, these viral infections will promote complications and graft rejection (7, 21, 22, 34) . In the present review of 34 studies, our goal was to assess the strength and the characteristics of this association in available clinical reports and whether this translates into an observable association in real-life conditions. Incomplete microbiological investigations or insensitive diagnostic tools limited the completeness of viral investigations; only the most recent reports have used a large panel of molecular tests and can provide a less biased image of the respective role of each viral agent. In the early 1990s, studies used mainly viral culture or direct immunofluorescence and, if available, PCR was limited to influenza, RSV or parainfluenza viruses. The recent emergence of new viruses such as HMpV, coronavirus NL63, coronavirus, HKU1, bocavirus and human rhinovirus C need to be included in any modern molecular panel; these new agents have been systematically studied in two studies only. Interestingly, when tested, the so-called 'common cold' viruses like rhinoviruses and coronavirus revealed to be the most frequent compared to others such as influenza or paramyxoviruses, an observation consistent with other hospital-based studies. Depending on the type and number of technique used, the size of the study or enrolment criteria, the observed frequency of viral infections can dramatically change-ranging for each individual virus from less than 1% to more than 20% in our pooled analysis (Table S1 ).",

This raises several issues such as the respective ability of each respiratory virus to infect the lower respiratory tract and whether all of them should be considered as equally able to cause graft complications in LTRs. Despite being expected, our pooled analysis was unable to confirm a positive association between acute rejection and a previous viral infection. However, this conclusion needs to be considered carefully since the three largest studies (7, 28, 34) representing 96% of all cases brought discordant results; two of these failed to observe a positive association (7, 28) , whereas a third (34) reported a 33.3% rejection rate in 48 virus-positive cases compared to 6.7% in virusnegative cases (p value = 0.001). Of note, this latter study considered not only biopsy-proven cases as rejection criteria, but also a FEV 1 decline of 20% or more. Another potential limitation of our pooled analysis is related to the heterogeneity of the design of each study: some reported an acute rejection rate during the acute phase of the viral infection and others during a follow-up period of 3 months.",

In at least seven other studies in which BOS incidence was evaluated or discussed, the risk could not be linked to respiratory viruses or was not evaluable. The median number of virus-positive cases in the 10 studies in which BOS was analyzed was five (range 1-13). Four of these studies compared the rate in virus-positive versus negative cases for a total of only nine BOS events in those virus-positive cases ( Table 2 ). The low number of events, incompleteness, heterogeneity and the retrospective design of published reports, did not allow us to conduct any appropriate statistical analysis. Of note, some studies have suggested that selected viruses, such as RSV, PIV, influenza and possibly (7, 21, 22, 34) HMpV (6, 21) , are particularly prone to trigger graft rejection. In most of these studies, control groups were incomplete and thus again the clinical relationship between one specific respiratory viral family and graft rejection needs to be reconsidered carefully.",
