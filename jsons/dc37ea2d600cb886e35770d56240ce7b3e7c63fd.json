Lyfe is defined as any system that fulfills all four processes of the living state, namely: dissipation, autocatalysis, homeostasis, and learning. Life is defined as the instance of lyfe that we are familiar with on Earth, one that uses a specific organometallic molecular toolbox to record information about its environment and achieve dynamical order by dissipating certain planetary disequilibria. This new classification system allows the astrobiological community to more clearly define the questions that propel their research-e.g., whether they are developing a historical narrative to explain the origin of life (on Earth), or a universal narrative for the emergence of lyfe, or whether they are seeking signs of life specifically, or lyfe at large across the universe. While the concept of \"life as we don't know it\" is not new, the four pillars of lyfe offer a novel perspective on the living state that is indifferent to the particular components that might produce it.",

NASA's current working definition of life is \"a self-sustaining chemical system capable of Darwinian evolution.\" While this is a fair description of the life that is present at this moment on planet Earth, searching the universe for phenomena that fit this definition is similar to playing darts by focusing solely on the bullseye. For the uninitiated darts player, there are three problems with aiming only for the bullseye in a game of darts: (1) It is hard to hit because it occupies a tiny area of the dart board; (2) It is not the highest scoring region on the board (triple 60 for 180 is); (3) There are other high-scoring regions that should also be considered as targets. Hence, in the search for extraterrestrial life, we must consider that: (1) Life exactly as we know it may be rare in the universe, but a more general class of phenomena with life-like characteristics may be far more common; (2) There may be systems, yet to be discovered or even imagined, that more successfully satisfy the living criteria than even earthly life does; (3) By loosening our constraints on the definition of life, we open ourselves up to exploring the full parameter space of physical and chemical interactions that may create life.",

One example is the so-called \"chemistry conservation principle\" as invoked by [3] . Their argument is summarized thus: \"The chemical traits of organisms are more conservative than the changing environment and hence retain information about ancient environmental conditions\" [4] .

Conversely, in many \"metabolism-first\" theories, life is viewed \"like other self-organizing systems in the Universe, as an inevitable outcome of particular disequilibria\" [6] . In this view, life, first and foremost, serves to dissipate these specific disequilibria, using disequilibria conversion engines to maintain its own low-entropy state [7, 8] . Furthermore, in \"compartment-first\" theories, \"compartmentalization of primitive biochemical reactions within membrane-bound water micro-droplets is considered an essential step in the origin of life\" [9] . This spatial organization and molecular crowding is often mediated by self-assembling lipid vesicles, conferring heightened functionalilty to other biomolecules [10, 11] .",

The four pillars constitute necessary and sufficient requirements of the lyving state while remaining divorced from the specific components that make up the system. This is illustrated by the fact that there are numerous systems that perform the same pillars but are quite distinct in form (as will be discussed in Section 2.1). Hence, the universality of the term \"lyfe\" is derived from the reasonable expectation that it can be applied to as yet undiscovered (or uninvented) systems that exist at myriad scales across the universe. There may even be a class of systems, still undiscovered and undescribed, that performs all four pillars of lyfe and some fifth pillar as well. Such systems might be deemed super-lyfe. While the discovery of super-lyfe would certainly be paradigm-shifting, we remain agnostic about its existence for now.",

The pillars that can be ascribed to a certain system depend specifically on the boundaries with which we use to refer to that system. For example, which pillars do viruses perform? A single virus in isolation cannot perform any of the pillars. Viruses in a system consisting of viruses, bacteria, and nutrients can perform autocatalysis and, through the coercion of their bacterial hosts, dissipation. Viruses in a biosphere that is coevolving with its environment will cause not only autocatalysis and dissipation but learning (through evolution) as well. In certain ecosystems, viruses may even impart homeostatic attributes to the system by introducing auxiliary metabolic genes to their hosts and recycling organic matter via lysis [45] . Thus, the argument about whether a virus (or a mule, to cite another classic paradox) is alive becomes irrelevant under the assumption that \"lyfeness\" does not emerge at the molecular, cellular, or organismal level. Like others have suggested [46, 47] , we contend that the living state may best be assessed at an ecosystem or planetary scale.",

However, harnessing such a fluctuation would require measurement and information-processing, and, as [56] showed, to accomplish this in a finite memory system requires erasure, which cannot be done for free and hence there is in fact no free energy created by fluctuations of an equilibrium system. In general, any perturbation of such a system will disappear in finite time as the system re-relaxes, hence we allow for homeostasis in equilibrium systems (in contrast, biological homeostatic processes generally occur through the consumption of free energy).",

In our view, it is also plausible that relatively simple systems capable of rudimentary information processing can arise de novo and that the ability of these systems to optimize over time their dissipative, autocatalytic, and homeostatic traits will determine their ultimate fate (see also [66] ). For instance, the first life on Earth almost certainly did not use DNA for information storage or any recognizable enzymes in its metabolic network. After innumerable tugs of war between chance and necessity, evolution produced the familiar macromolecules that we observe today. In Section 2.2, we turn to how the concept of lyfe can change our approaches to investigations of the origins of life. ",

            "text": "With regard to the origins-of-life narratives discussed in Section 1.1, lyfe encompasses any system that fulfills the four pillars described above but may fulfill the three classic privileged functions-replication, metabolism, and compartmentalization-using components not used by earthly life. The idea that these three privileged functions define the necessary and sufficient conditions for life was explored in great theoretical detail within the artificial life field and the concepts of autopoiesis [67] and the \"Chemoton\" [68] . Figure 6 shows a \"cube\" whose vertices represent living systems with different combinations of components fulfilling the three privileged functions. At one vertex, life fulfills these privileged functions using the mechanisms of RNA/DNA, chemiosmosis, and lipid membranes. Directly connected to life are instances of lyfe that share two of the three mechanisms with life. Two steps removed from life are instances of lyfe that share only one of the three mechanisms with life. Furthermore, at the opposite vertex is a lyfe form completely unlike earthly life. In Figure 6 , life is positioned at the apex, because this is the end goal of most origins-of-life hypotheses. In origins-of-life narratives that involve stepwise emergence, an abiotic system might follow a trajectory that moves from one vertex to another, finally arriving at life. An example of this is illustrated by the dashed purple line in Figure 6 , which denotes a narrative in which the abiotic synthesis of RNA was the first step in life's onset, followed by compartmentalization inside of lipid membranes, followed by the emergence of chemiosmotic metabolism (e.g., an RNA world hypothesis). The way this diagram is drawn, origins-of-life narratives would be described by trajectories that move \"upward\" towards a convergence upon the general biochemical composition of life as we know it. However, the \"cube\" shape of Figure 6 allows one to easily rotate the figure in the mind's eye so that any combination of fulfilling mechanisms to the three privileged functions is at the apex-perhaps as a lyfeform would see it. Performing this mental gymnastics sparks two realizations: (1) The earliest stages of life's evolution may have passed through phases that fully meet the living criteria but that we would identify as lyfe; (2) Origins-of-life research should be open to imagining and seeking lyfe-like solutions to the three privileged functions because they might represent attractors that our particular biological history did not find or settle in but alien lyfe did. The more detailed reasons for why a system might traverse these alternative pathways or not are a vast topic of philosophical debate, beyond the scope of the present work.",

The first is the striking differences in composition and structure between scaffolding and finished products. The second is an analogy between biological evolution and the history of locomotives (Figure 7 ).

By examining the Shinkansen and knowing nothing else, could one deduce the origin of the locomotive (a \"metabolism\" run by burning fossil fuels to boil water into steam, \"compartmentalization\" made of cast iron and wood, and \"information processing\" in the form of a human conductor)?",

However, as [72] argued, the evolution of life has progressed through several \"major transitions,\" many of which reshaped biology's information processing capabilities. It is quite possible that at the earliest stages of life, such transitions were rampant, as primitive living systems battled for supremacy in a relatively flat fitness landscape, trading components with ease via horizontal transfers of information and material.

Phosphorous is a key constituent of modern biology; it is found in ATP, the universal energy currency of life, metabolic cofactors like NADH, and information storage molecules like DNA and RNA. However, ref. [81] identified a plausible phosphate-free metabolism using a systems biology approach. Within the biosphere, a phosphate-independent metabolism exists that heavily depends on iron-sulfur and transition metal enzymes-which themselves have been linked to geochemical scenarios for the emergence of biochemistry [82] [83] [84] . Network-based algorithms suggest that various environmental parameters could result in a thioester-based proto-metabolic network similar to the reductive tricarboxylic acid cycle [85] . This would result in a \"thioester world\", which, once phosphate became bioavailable, transitioned to the modern \"phosphate world\" that features ATP and nucleotides [70] .

This metastable mineral is hypothesized to have been a constituent of Hadean submarine alkaline hydrothermal vents. Due to its reduction-oxidation capabilities, green rust is thought to have been an important driver of organosynthesis in these contexts [90] . Within its flexible, anhydrous interlayers, nitrate can be converted to ammonium [91, 92] , and it is hypothesized that inorganic carbon can be converted to pyruvate, which can then be aminated to alanine. At the same time, the theory suggests that green rust could act as a primitive inorganic pyrophosphatase-making it one of the first nanoengines of life [93] . Some have even hypothesized that the variable Fe 2+ /Fe 3+ cations might have served as a primitive information-storage system [86, 93, 94] . If green rust (or a similar mineral) played the role of a molecular machine at the emergence of life, then that protometabolic system could be classified as lyfe.",

One intriguing possibility is Titan, the only other world in the Solar System known to possess stable bodies of liquid on its surface.

Alternatively, membranes may not be required for lyfe on Titan because the extraordinarily low temperatures already prevent the dissolution of macromolecules, and membrane-like structures would inhibit the diffusion of metabolites in and out of a cold, stationary lyving system [105] .

This occurs through the flagellar motor proteins, close relatives of the ATP synthases [110, 111] . Flagellar motors dissipate the free energy of ATP hydrolysis in eukaryotes, or ion motive forces in prokaryotes, for the production of rotational motion. Rotation of the central rotor causes the flagellar filament to spin, and the structure of the filament allows the rotational motion to produce translational movement of the organism in water (this motion has been compared to the mechanism by which corks are thrust from a bottle by the rotation of a corkscrew [112] ).",

Imagine a single-celled organism in flowing water that is anchored to a rock via a pilus-like tether filament (like a person parasailing behind a boat). Assume that such an organism is equipped with the type of flagellar motor proteins that have been studied in swimming bacteria or single-cell eukaryotes. The flow of water causes rotational motion of flagellar filaments, and this rotational motion is used for ATP synthesis (or perhaps some other endergonic chemical step in more exotic lyfe), as shown in Figure 8 . Whether this is feasible depends on the thermodynamic and fluid dynamic conditions. Note that such a mechanotrophic organism might have a different design to the archetypal swimming bacterium. For example, it may use a torsionally stiff tether attached to a molecular generator molecule (the flagellum being driven), and the whole cell might rotate around the tether-generator complex. In this case the flagellum would be fixed relative to the cell body (at the opposite end to the tether-generator complex) and would rotate with the cell. The hydrodynamic details, efficiencies, and energetics of such an organism will be explored in detail in a future work. Here we simply wish to highlight the possibility of such an organism. This would be a prime example of a lyfeform, though it is also possible that such an organism exists on Earth but has simply gone unnoticed to date.",

Any physical system exhibiting all of these necessary and sufficient features could be classified as lyfe, our designation for the set of all systems fulfilling the criteria, including the more specific case of life on Earth. This is in contrast to the idea of privileged functions, the pursuit of which has guided much of the research in the origins-of-life field. Systems that show differing levels of similarity to life (e.g., a different metabolic system or information-processing apparatus), could be considered lyfe or sublyfe. This would include phases of life's emergence before it arrived upon the familiar metabolic cycles and pathways, DNA/RNA information storage and processing, and lipid membranes.",

When seeking to explain the emergence of biology on Earth or signatures of exobiology that are directly analogous to life on Earth, it would be appropriate to refer to life. On the other hand, when addressing questions related to more general systems that share the properties of life but differ in chemical or structural specifics, it would be appropriate to refer to lyfe. For example, finding unicellular chemotrophs resembling archaea on Europa would constitute a discovery of life. On the other hand, finding methane-based biology on Titan would constitute a discovery of lyfe.",

Indeed, our ignorance in this matter is what motivates a conceptual definition of life that is agnostic to specific components and highlights processes instead. Only by seeking other instances of lyfe can we know if life is a proper subset of lyfe or if life and lyfe are identical sets. By framing life as a subset of a larger class of hypothetical phenomena called lyfe, we encourage the search for lyfe as we do not know it. This search can lead us to a deeper scientific understanding of what, how, and why we are: If we find that lyfe exists only in the form of life, that would suggest that the specific molecular components of life dictate the functionality of the lyving state (in line with a reductionist point of view). However, if we find that lyfe exists in myriad forms, that would suggest that \"lyfeness\" is emergent.",

Life, being the sought-after end-product of origins-of-life hypotheses (one such shown by the dotted purple trajectory), is positioned at the apex. The tier directly below life contains two common components to life. The tier below that contains one common component. The final tier contains no common components. Connecting the vertices via common components creates a \"cube\".

While the materials that trains are built from have changed over time, their purpose and functions have remained constant. By analogy, the biological components that life uses today may be different from the biological components at life's emergence, but the processes-the four pillars of lyfe-have been conserved.
