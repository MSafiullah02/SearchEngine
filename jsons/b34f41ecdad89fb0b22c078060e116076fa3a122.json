By 14 th March 2020, around 1,45,810 positive cases and 5,436 deaths were reported due to the corona virus disease (\"COVID-19 Corona virus outbreak,\" n.d.). Print, electronic and social media are flooded with numerous advisories issued by governments and other national & international agencies looking after health-related affairs. While all this is being done with best of intentions so as to contain the spread of this viral disease, this is causing a significant negative impact on mental health of people. World Health Organization (WHO) has already taken a note of the same and has issued an advisory in this regard (Organiation, 2020) . However, what has not been recognized is the impact of this issue on existing patients of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and other anxiety disorders. Various patients' and care-givers' groups have perceived the trouble and are expressing their concerns about the same (Adam, 2020) . Fear of contamination and excessive washing of hands is probably the commonest symptom of OCD (Akhtar, Wig, Varma, Pershad, & Verma, 1975; Khanna, Kaliaperumal, & Channabasavanna, 1990 ) and now with so much of emphasis on washing hands in health advisories, it is possible that symptoms of OCD might worsen. We report a case of patient of OCD who was in remission with treatment and has now shown relapse of symptoms after advent of corona virus disease and related health advisories.",

The patient found these thoughts very uncomfortable & annoying and failed to resist them despite several attempts. There was a J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f delay in starting his treatment as they were not aware of this illness and its treatment. He consulted a psychiatrist for the first time around five years ago and has been taking fluoxetine 60 mg and clonazepam 0.5 mg daily. He was keeping well until few weeks back when the media buzzed with corona virus cases all over the world. He started to avoid meeting people and his frequency of washing hands increased to the extent that made him dysfunctional. He was not willing to come to hospital and had to be forced by his father to seek consultation. He acknowledged that he had developed intense fear of getting infected with the virus after watching programs on television, listening to programs over radio and reading/watching messages on social media platforms like",

Among wide variety of problems faced by patients of OCD, fear of dirt, feeling of being contaminated and excessive washing & cleaning are the most common ones (Akhtar et al., 1975; Khanna et al., 1990) . The patients of OCD try to resist these thoughts and urges to wash themselves but often fail to do so. Now that the celebrities, public figures, governments and other authorities/bodies dealing with health-related affairs are prompting people to wash hands repeatedly, patients of OCD may find it difficult to resist. Also, what may start as a genuine protective measure might easily slip out of control in vulnerable individuals and lead to serious trouble. Ongoing lockdown of cities & countries and advice to avoid public/crowded places might J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f further prevent sufferers from reaching to hospitals/psychiatrists/psychotherapists. Delay/difficulty in seeking help shall add to suffering of such patients. Such problems have been reported during outbreak of swine flu in the years 2009 and with HIV-AIDS in past (Penzel, n.d.) .",
