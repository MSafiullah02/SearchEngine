            "text": "The 12th International Congress of Histochemistry and Cytochemistry (ICHC) was held on July 24\u201328, 2004 in San Diego La Jolla, California. As the President of International Federation of Societies for Histochemistry and Cytochemistry (IFSHC), Ron Van Noorden rightly thinks, this discipline remains very much alive and contributes significantly to our understanding of structure and function of cells and tissues. Moreover, most histochemical techniques are now extended to whole organs and organisms in order to study cell biological and pathological processes. In consideration of most significant developments in this discipline, the 12th ICHC was entitled \u201cCellular and Molecular Interactions in Development and Disease.\u201d In the last years, histochemistry and cytochemistry have particularly developed some strategies to: (1) increase sensitivity of in situ hybridization and immunohistochemical techniques at both the light and electron microscopic levels in order to detect low amounts of mRNA or protein in cells and tissues; (2) develop technologies based on green fluorescent protein (GFP) and related fluorescent proteins in combination with highly sensitive digital imaging in order to monitor tumor development in live animals; (3) generate 3\u2010D images of live cells in multi\u2010dimensional light microscopy; (4) improve EM tomography technology to allow 3\u2010D reconstructions of a high spatial resolution of subcellular structures. Based on these new frontiers of histochemistry, the 12th ICHC selected several topics divided in thirteen symposia, nine plenary lectures and six workshops. In the opening lecture entitled: \u201cBreeding Molecules to Spy on Cells,\u201d R.Y. Tsien (Howard Hughes Medical Institute, USA) presented an interesting new mechanism based on uptake of a wide variety of contrast agents into cells and tissues that are offering the possibility to specifically concentrate these agents, such as radioactive, magnetic, and infrared agents, in diseased tissues (Tsien, 2005). In addition, R.Y. Tsien received the David Glick Award in recognition of outstanding scientific contributions to the advancement and practice of Histochemistry and Cytochemistry. During the opening ceremony an other important prize, the Paul Nakane Prize in recognition of outstanding scientific contributions and international leadership in the advancement of the disciplines of Histochemistry and Cytochemistry was given to P.K. Nakane. In the first plenary lecture, entitled: \u201cCalcified Tissues: The Backbone of the Life,\u201d A.

In the Symposium: \u201cExtracellular Matrix and Inflammation,\u201d W.

Saito (Japan) focused on PKC\u2010delta targeting induced by ceramide in a single cell and PKC\u2010gamma targeting induced by physiological stimulation in the neuronal network suggesting the importance of spatio\u2010temporal activation of the specific PKC subtype in various cell responses (Kajimoto et al., 2004). In the 5th Workshop entitled: \u201cSpectral Imaging,\u201d J.

In the Symposium: \u201cIs Histochemistry an omic?,\u201d G.C. Coulton (United Kingdom) proposed that Histochemistry can be considered as a part of new \u2018omic\u2019 sciences as well as genomics, proteomics, cytomics and that it belongs to byomics that is the integrated application of science into a coherent strategy for understanding biological complexity; G.

In the Symposium: \u201cCell adhesion and Cancer,\u201d D.

Couchman (United Kingdom) showed that perlecan, a ubiquitous proteoglycan of basement membranes, regulates tumor cell growth and promotes tumor formation and angiogenesis, but this appears to be multifactorial, and largely independent of heparin sulphate\u2013VEGF interactions (Jiang et al., 2004). In the 6th Workshop entitled: \u201cRetrieval of DNA, RNA and protein from archival tissues by AR based methods,\u201d C.R. Taylor (USA) overviewed the mechanism of the antigen retrieval (AR), studies of effectiveness and standardization; T.J.

Robinson (USA) described the incorporation of a permeabilization/denaturation step using sodium dodecyl sulphate that improves immunolabeling for certain antigens in both cells and cryosections of tissues; M.L. Ingram (USA) showed that histoids, the 3\u2010D constructs generated in the co\u2010controlled conditions, are expected to have advantages over the conventional standards of tissue sections, tissue microarrays or cell lines alone for IHC or FISH/CISH procedures; and S.\u2010R. Shi (USA) focused on determination of optimal chemical reagents to develop simpler, and more effective heat induced DNA retrieval technique on archival formalin\u2010fixed, paraffin\u2010embedded (FFPE) tissue sections.

Frederiks (The Netherlands) showed that in situ zymography provides data that extend our understanding of the role of specific proteinases in various physiological and pathological conditions (Frederiks and Mook, 2004). In the Symposium: \u201cNew Aspects of Neuropeptides, Regulation and Signaling,\u201d R.E.

Sawchenko (USA) summarized the results of experiments in which pharmacological or genetic manipulations of one or more of corticotrophin\u2010releasin factor (CRF) family members have been used to ascertain their involvement in specific aspects of the CNS response to central peptide administration or various types of stress; and R. Elde (USA) presented rapid advances using histochemical methods that led to a profound change in our understanding of the regulation and biological mechanisms that underlie the function and role of opioid receptors, and by inference, receptors for many other neuropeptides (Stone et al., 2004). In the 9th plenary lecture entitled: \u201cThe Molecular Morphology of SARS\u201d, J. Gu (School of Basic Medical Sciences, China) showed that examinations of tissue samples from various organs of SARS patients died at late stage of the infection and white blood cells collected at early and mid stages of the disease demonstrated that SARS virus did not only injure the lungs but also infected multiple organs and cell types and so molecular morphology played a key role in understanding the pathogenesis of SARS that will guide future prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and vaccine development of this new disease. About 177 posters have been presented. During the congress were also given 20 IFSHC Young Histochemist Awards and 14 HCS Young Histochemist Awards.
