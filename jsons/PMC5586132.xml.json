            "text": "Acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) is an acute widespread demyelinating condition usually affecting young adults and children. It usually follows an infection or vaccination causing demyelination in brain and spinal cord. Failure to identify a viral agent suggests that the inciting agents are unusual or cannot be recovered by standard laboratory test. Possibly, a complex interplay among cytokines, chemokines, and adhesion molecules is responsible for the cellular events of inflammatory encephalomyelitis. Management consist of immunomodulation targeted to suppress a presumed aberrant immune response to an infectious agent or a vaccination. Malignant variants of ADEM, represent 2% of cases with catastrophic rapid symptom progression, malignant brain edema, non-responsiveness to treatment and high mortality rates.",

She had visual acuity limited to the perception of lights in both eyes. Fundoscopic examination and pupils were normal. Other cranial nerve examination was normal. Motor system examination showed 4/5 power in the left upper and lower limb with 5/5 on the right side. Deep tendon reflexes were exaggerated in all 4 limbs and planters equivocal on the right and extensor on the left. Routine hematological and biochemical investigations were normal. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) study revealed acellular aspirate with raised protein (53 mg/dl) and normal sugar levels. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) brain with contrast showed ill-defined T2 and fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) hyper intensity predominantly involving the subcortical white matter at the gray-white matter junction in the right frontal, bilateral parietal lobes with patchy restricted diffusion in these areas [Figure 1]. There was no blooming or parenchymal enhancement associated with these lesions. A diagnosis of postinfectious acute demyelinating encephalomyelitis (ADEM) was kept based on clinical history, evaluation and neuroimaging findings. The patient was started on 500 mg intravenous (IV) methylprednisolone pulse therapy followed by 40 mg of oral steroids.",

The clinical examination revealed bradycardia and increase blood pressure with decreasing level of consciousness has raised the suspicion of raised intracranial pressure (ICP).

A serial MRI brain showed increase in lesional size and extent with widespread edema, increase in hyperintensities on T2 and FLAIR in the right frontal, left temporoparietal, and bilateral occipital lobes, distal body, and selenium of the corpus callosum. Effacement of the regional sulci was seen. There were patchy restricted diffusion and patchy contrast enhancement seen in involved regions of bilateral cerebral hemispheres [Figure 2]. Repeated screen for sepsis and other organ dysfunction were noncontributory. On day 7, patient's conscious level further declined, and she was electively ventilated. A study of aquaporin antibodies and oligoclonal bands was negative. The patient became comatose and started having intermittent decerebrate posturing with horizontal roving eye movements suggestive of widespread cerebral dysfunction. She was started on IVIgs (0.4 g/kg/day for 5 days). She did not improve, and meanwhile, a trephine biopsy of the brain was done from her lesion in the left parietal area on day 7.",
