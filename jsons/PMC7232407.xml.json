            "text": "HuNoV is a member of the Caliciviridae family [1] and is a non-enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus [2]. HuNoVs have 7.5\u20137.7 kb genomes that contain three open reading frames (ORFs) [3]. ORF1 codes for the six nonstructural proteins, in order from the N-terminus to C-terminus: p48, nucleoside-triphosphatase (NTPase), p22, VPg, 3C-like protease (3CLpro), and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) [4,5]. Subgenomic RNA, containing ORFs 2 and 3, codes for the major and minor structural proteins, VP1 and VP2 [6]. Noroviruses (NoVs) are subdivided into ten genogroups (GI-GX) based upon sequence homology of VP1 [7]. GI, GII, and to a lesser extent, GIV, GVIII, and GIX viruses infect humans. These genogroups are stratified into genotypes: GI (n = 9), GII (n = 27), GIV (n = 2), GVIII (n = 1), and GIX (n = 1) [7]. The GII.4 HuNoV strains account for ~70% of HuNoV infections [8]. GII.4 HuNoVs have caused pandemics and are now the major circulating strains [9,10,11]. Currently, a recombinant GII.4 Sydney pandemic strain (GII.P16-GII.4 Sydney) causes the majority of infections, making it the most suitable strain for vaccine development [12,13].",

Considerable quantities of viruses are shed in the feces for several weeks, even after symptoms have resolved [18,19,20,21]. The stability of the viral capsid and a low infectious dose facilitate person-to-person transmission. HuNoVs cause ~700 million infections and ~219,000 deaths annually [22,23,24]. HuNoV infections can be debilitating particularly in developing countries where the young (<5 years), the elderly, and the immunocompromised are most susceptible.",

            "text": "Currently, there are no licensed vaccines or approved therapeutics for HuNoV. This is related to the lack of a characterized and reproducible mammalian cell substrate, a lack of a small animal model that emulates infection and disease, and the absence of methods to properly assess vaccine efficacy or protection [25,26,27]. The most progressed HuNoV vaccine candidates are subunit vaccines generated from virus-like particles (VLPs) [28,29,30,31,32]. Although VLP vaccines appear promising, a well-characterized mammalian cell culture substrate is required for the development of inactivated or live-attenuated HuNoV vaccines [33]. Histo-blood group antigens (HBGAs), which are terminal carbohydrates of lipid- or protein-linked glycan chains, are attachment factors for HuNoV [34]. However, it has been shown that HBGA expression does not make a cell permissive for HuNoV infection [35]. CD300ld/CD300lf have been identified as murine NoV receptors and are the only functional receptors known for NoVs [36,37]. Recently, HuNoVs has been propagated in human intestinal enteroids (HIEs) and in a human Burkitt lymphoma B cell (BJAB) cell line [38,39]. These findings are encouraging, but as HIEs are not a stable or clonal cell line, and have a limited lifespan, HIEs are unqualified for vaccine production. Also, the BJAB cell line has been reported to support only a single strain of HuNoV, require HBGA cell culture supplementation, and has reproducibility issues [39,40], making these cells inadequate for vaccine production. In contrast, Vero cells are a continuous mammalian cell line derived from an African green monkey cell line deficient for interferon-\u03b1 (IFN\u03b1) and -\u03b2 (IFN\u03b2) due to a fortuitous genetic deletion [41,42]. This feature has made Vero cells a leading cell line to use for poliovirus, rabies virus, influenza virus, and rotavirus vaccine propagation [43]. However, past attempts to propagate HuNoVs in Vero cells have been ineffective [38,44,45] possibly because the earlier studies used inadequate virus incubation times. In contrast, this study shows that Vero cells can function as a mammalian cell substrate for HuNoV. Specifically, this study shows that HuNoV modestly replicates in Vero cells as determined by indirect ELISA and quantitative reverse-transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) endpoint assays. We examined HuNoV genome replication of two pandemic GII.4 strains and one GII.3 strain by qRT-PCR and using indirect ELISA, flow cytometry, and immunofluorescence show that both structural and nonstructural HuNoV protein levels are increased. Additionally, we show that exosome-mediated HuNoV infection of Vero cells occurs as previously reported for rotaviruses and NoVs [46]. Vero cells were permissive for both filtered and unfiltered clinical stool samples at a wide MOI range. We also explored ways to increase HuNoV replication and show that HuNoV replication can be improved ~1.5-fold by addition of trypsin to the cell culture media, or by Vero cell gene knockdown (KD) or knockout (KO) of specific host genes. These findings provide support for use of Vero cells as a cell culture model for HuNoV replication.",

Single-cell colonies were sorted using a MoFlo Astrios EQ (Beckman Coulter, Brea, CA, USA) based on GFP expression 48 h post-transfection into 96-well plates. Expansion of the colonies from a 96-well plate format to a 6-well plate format was performed in parallel to allow for genotypic (qRT-PCR followed by Sanger sequencing and next-generation sequencing) and phenotypic (HuNoV infection) validation. Gene KO was confirmed by bp deletion resulting in disruption of the ORF. Additionally, clones containing genes with insertions were excluded from the analysis.",

We previously used low-passaged Vero cells in the development of vaccine substrates for several viruses [52,54]. To begin to evaluate HuNoV infection, we showed that HuNoV RNAs are present within Vero cells following a 1 h or 6 h incubation by qRT-PCR (Figure 1A). HuNoVs use HBGAs, such as the H-antigen, as attachment factors [55,56,57]; however, they are not a requirement for HuNoV infection [58,59,60,61,62]. We examined the level of H-antigen expression on Vero cells or Caco-2 cells and showed that Vero cells do not express the H-antigen by ELISA (Figure 1B). Also, we showed that Vero cells express the murine NoV receptor, CD300ld/CD300lf [36,37,63] (Figure 1C,D). We attempted to inhibit HuNoV entry into Vero cells using antibody blockade of CD300ld/CD300lf, and by saturating potential CD300ld/CD300lf binding sites using a CD300ld/CD300lf ectodomain peptide, but both treatments were unsuccessful [51]. These findings are consistent with the report that CD300ld/CD300lf are not receptors for HuNoV [64].",

In these studies, GII.4 Sydney genome replication peaked between 48\u201372 hpi (Figure 2A) and was ablated by UV irradiation as expected (Figure 2B). The fold-decrease following UV-inactivated HuNoV incubation for 72 h likely corresponds to the degradation of non-replicative HuNoV RNA by Vero cells (Figure 2B). To determine if the findings for GII.4 Sydney were strain-specific, Vero cells were examined for their ability to propagate GII.3 and GII.4 Yerseke HuNoV strains (Figure 2C,D). Of note, replication for these three HuNoV strains produced no detectable cytopathic effects at any MOI or time-points tested. To support replication, HuNoV protein expression was examined for GII.4 Sydney (Figure 3A) and GII.3 (Figure 3B) HuNoV using a rabbit anti-VP1 antibody indirect ELISA. Statistically significant (p < 0.0001) dose-dependent detection of VP1 was observed at an input time-point (Figure 3A). Furthermore, the ELISA showed increases in HuNoV capsid and p48, a nonstructural protein (Figure 3A,B, and Supplementary Figure S2). ELISAs were evaluated instead of Western blots because they are quantitative and allow for the detection of low protein levels. We also examined the expression of VP1, and p48 in HuNoV infected Vero cells by flow cytometry (Figure 3C) and showed both proteins were expressed in a low percentage of cells, a result similar to the findings observed by immunofluorescence assay (Figure 3D).",

Our findings indicated that exosome-associated HuNoVs are internalized by Vero cells at levels similar to HuNoV from unseparated stool samples [65] and that exosome-associated GII.4 HuNoVs were replication-competent in Vero cells (Figure 4). This study also examined the tempo and peak of HuNoV replication from filtered or unfiltered stool samples. There were no substantial differences detected suggesting that bacteria or other filterable agents from stool samples did not facilitate HuNoV replication [51], contrary to culturing HuNoVs in BJABs [39].

            "text": "Enteric virus capsids that are primarily transmitted by the fecal-oral route are remarkably durable as they have a role in protecting the viral RNA, particularly when the virus is outside of the host cell. However, these capsids typically require proteolytic cleavage for virus activation, binding, infection, and replication [66,67,68,69,70,71]. Proteolytic cleavage has been examined for HuNoV but trypsin was shown to have little effect [44,72,73] likely because the intact virion is resistant [74]. However, smaller conformations of HuNoV capsid proteins are trypsin-cleavable [75]. Thus, we examined a range (1.76\u201310,000 BAEE units) of trypsin treatments and determined that HuNoV titers slightly increased (~1.5-fold) using a higher MOI = 100 when co-incubated with 8.8 BAEE units of trypsin throughout the infection time-course (Supplementary Figure S5A). This effect was consistent with the abundance of trypsin-cleavable capsid conformations. Trypsin addition also increased exosome-associated HuNoV replication (~1.5-fold) in a MOI-dependent manner, but at a lower MOI = 1.0 (Supplementary Figure S5B). Selective loading of trypsin-cleaved capsid conformations into exosomes may not occur, explaining the inconsistency of HuNoV replication enhancement at MOI = 100.",

The LRGUK gene was screened and validated as an antiviral gene regulating rotavirus replication [53], and interestingly only the LRGUK KO Vero cell line, but not LRGUK KD improved HuNoV replication (Supplementary Tables S1 and S2). This is likely due to the heterozygous nature of the gene KD using siRNAs or bias of the single cell-derived population for enhanced ability to replicate GII.3 HuNoVs. Collectively, these results demonstrate HuNoV replication of three HuNoV strains in Vero cells. These data provide evidence of HuNoV attachment, internalization, genome replication, and viral protein production. Further, modest replication in Vero cells may be enhanced by trypsin or by siRNA KD or CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing of antiviral host genes. These studies provide support for further investigation of Vero cells as a cell culture model for HuNoV research.",

We found that for all HuNoV strains tested, virus attachment to Vero cells was low ranging from two to four percent, a finding consistent with a previous report [73]. Cell-surface expression of CD300ld/CD300lf on Vero cells was unexpected because it had only been previously observed on immune cells [37,77], and more recently on tuft cells, an uncommon gastrointestinal epithelial cell type [78]. We attempted to inhibit HuNoV entry into Vero cells using antibody blockade, and by saturation of potential CD300ld/CD300lf binding sites using a CD300ld/CD300lf ectodomain peptide, but both attempts were unsuccessful [51]. We showed that the tempo of HuNoV replication in Vero cells was similar to HIE cells [38], BJAB cells [39], gnotobiotic pigs [79], and gnotobiotic calves [80]. We demonstrated HuNoV replication (\u22651.5-fold) in three Vero cell line clones over a 72h time-course [51]. Efforts to detect HuNoV replication in Caco-2 cells, HEp-2 cells, HepG2 cells, INT 407 cells, RAW 264.7 cells, and RAW 264.7+ Caco-2 co-cultured cells using comparable methodologies were unsuccessful (Supplementary Table S1). We found HuNoV replication in Vero cells to be reduced when compared to BJAB cells (up to 25-fold), or HIE cells (up to 1000-fold) possibly because HuNoV replication in Vero cells may be limited to a single replication cycle. Interestingly, prolonged incubation of HuNoV with Vero cells impedes their ability to replicate after passaging with no replication observed after 24-h incubation with Vero cells (Supplementary Figure S7). This may indicate that following virus uncoating, a new infection cycle is not initiated but this has not been experimentally confirmed. Notably, a single HuNoV replication cycle has also been reported for other HuNoV replicon models [27]. A comparable attempt at infecting Vero cells did not observe g.e. increases likely because later time-points (days 4\u20139 pi) were evaluated [45], which likely missed the peak HuNoV replication (Figure 2A).",

These data imply that, unlike BJAB cells, Vero cells do not appear to require exogenous HBGAs to aid HuNoV replication. While trypsin is needed for proteolytic cleavage events affecting some enteric viruses [66,67,68,69,70,71], the HuNoV capsid is understood to be resistant to trypsin-mediated cleavage as trypsin does not impact binding or internalization [72,73,84]. HuNoV capsids contain approximately 15 trypsin cleavage sites; however, each site is inaccessible to the enzyme while in its infectious form [74]. Of note, a trypsin-cleavable GII.3 norovirus virion has been described [85,86]. Smaller conformations of the HuNoV capsid form under alkaline conditions [84,87], such as those in the gastrointestinal tract, and upon exposure to trypsin can be cleaved [75]. Following cleavage, these capsid conformations may have a role in the viral replication cycle [75]. The effect of trypsin on HuNoV titers following infection with native stool may correspond to a high MOI containing increased numbers of immunomodulatory trypsin-cleaved capsid conformations. Trypsin enhancement of exosome-associated HuNoV may occur at a low MOI because of virus clustering within exosomes, but this remains to be explored.",

            "text": "The antiviral host genes that affect HuNoV replication are not well-understood, but it is known that viruses co-opt host genes to replicate, and host genes are known to be required for virus replication. We took advantage of previous findings of virus\u2013host gene interactions [52,96,97]. Based on genome-wide siRNA screens for several RNA viruses, we examined the top six genes for which KD enhanced virus permissiveness and replication in Vero cells [52]. We created CRISPR-Cas9 gene-edited Vero cell lines to evaluate HuNoV replication based on siRNA KD findings. The antiviral host genes identified have diverse functions. It was shown that EMX2 functions in the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway and may have a role in cell cycle regulation and apoptosis [98]. EMX2 has also been shown to bind to the translational factor eIF4E [99]. This interaction may affect HuNoV VPg recruitment of eIF4E, modulating HuNoV replication. FGF2 has been shown to stabilize basally expressed RIG-I [100], implicating its downregulation with decreased virus sensing mechanisms. NEU2 functions as a sialidase and cleaves Lewis X carbohydrates [101]. HuNoV VLPs has been shown to bind Lewis X [57,102,103], conceivably implicating a decrease in NEU2 gene expression with increases in attachment factor availability. PYCR1 leads to cell cycle arrest [104,105]. A similar mechanism has been shown for the murine NoV VPg [106]. It remains unknown if VPg directs cell cycle arrest through PYCR1 downregulation. RAD51AP1 facilitates homologous recombination of host DNA [107], while SEC61G functions in membrane protein translocation and incorporation into the endoplasmic reticulum [108]. The interactions between HuNoV and these genes are speculative; however IRF3 [109,110], IRF7 [110,111], MDA5 [112,113,114,115], RIG-I [35,111,113,114], TLR3 [112], and TLR7 [114,116,117] have been previously implicated in NoV responses. Of note, TLR2 enhances cytokine production upon the detection of rotavirus [118]. No additive or synergistic effects were observed for any of the genes when two genes were KD simultaneously. We also attempted to corroborate the host genes needed for HuNoV replication with microRNA (miR) regulation, specifically miR-let7 (DDX58; RIG-I), miR-18a (RAD51AP1), miR-26b (TLR3), miR-105 (TLR2), miR-223 (TLR3), and miR-512 (TLR7), but were unsuccessful in linking the miRs to increased HuNoV replication (Supplementary Table S1). It is likely that the promiscuous nature of miRs for different targets may have obscured any effects. In summary, infection of Vero cells can occur and these data provide preliminary support for use of Vero cells as a cell culture model. Although replication of HuNoVs in Vero cells is low, infection rates and viral replication are poised to increase dramatically with the impending discovery of the HuNoV receptor. Ectopic expression of the HuNoV receptor in a Vero cell line would provide greatly enhanced HuNoV replication in this model, providing a robust system that is more applicable for industrial HuNoV vaccine production.",
