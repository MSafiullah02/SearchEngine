The direct effect is probably most apparent and is based on consumption of health-care resources and removal of people either temporarily or permanently from the labor force. According to a World Health Organization (WHO) report released on September 20, 2014, in the three affected countries 2803 deaths occurred out of 5843 of total Ebola virus disease cases detected, including confirmed, probable, and suspected cases.5 Some analysts fear that the true numbers may in fact be as large as two to four times what is reported due to underreporting issues. The major proportion of these deaths occurred in young persons, which exaggerates the workforce depletion effect. Contraction of labor resource resulted from largely workers who were diagnosed and subsequently died from the virus infection.",

There was an unmeasured effect of people staying home due to fear of exposure to the virus. All these factors resulted in reduced productivity, lower output, and lesser household income. The reduction in workforce cannot be compensated by smaller businesses that lack the ability to provide work retribution or shed less profitable parts of the business. Thus, loss of a critical mass means a death sentence for many small businesses in these countries.",

Other behavioral effects in these countries include people who are moving from diseased zones, the decrease in labor participation mainly due to people staying home from their jobs, foreign companies scared of the disease and getting rid of their employees, and closing borders for export of various materials. Such effects also motivate private decision-makers to disrupt travel, trade, and commerce by canceling scheduling commercial flights and reducing in shipping and cargo services. Some governments are motivated to close land borders and restrict entry of citizens from afflicted countries.6\n",

Agriculture accounts for nearly a quarter of the Liberia\u2019s GDP and employs almost half of the available workforce.8 The major reason for the severe impact on both export and domestic agriculture is due to reduced workforce mobility, people migrating to safe zones, and foreign companies postponing investment due to the evacuation of key expatriates affected. As a result, the World Bank revised its growth expectations from 3.5% to 1.3% (Table 13.2). Disruptions from the outbreak during the planting season earlier this year are expected to diminish yields for the staple crops of rice and maize during the harvest season, between October and December. Due to the neglect of many small farms that produce food for domestic consumption, the World Bank expects Liberia to experience food shortages that may in turn lead to food price increases.8\n",

The reason is either that the pregnant patient is too afraid to visit the health-care facility due to the fear of Ebola virus disease or, if she is at home, no one will help her because they are afraid of contact with the bodily fluids. Many of the health-care clinics refused to treat pregnant women due to fear of coming into contact with blood and other bodily fluids of women, and sometimes they even do not know if the patient is Ebola virus infected or not. When nothing else works, the patients end up giving birth in the streets. According to an estimate by UNFPA, there will be more than 800,000 women who will give birth in the next 12 months, and 120,000 of these pregnant women will face complications during pregnancy and childbirth and could die if the required lifesaving emergency obstetric care is not provided. This report also states that they still need 64.5 million dollars to provide all the services required to promote health of the expectant mothers and the newborn babies in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. Currently, they only have $3 million for this purpose.11 If these appropriate measures are not taken, they warn that one in seven pregnant women in these West African countries could die during childbirth.12 There may be a reduction in workforce due to newborn and infant mortality that will be felt two to four decades from now if situation does not improve.",

The researchers also found that men born in 1919 were shorter by about 0.05 inches relative to surrounding cohorts and were of lower weights as teenager with a higher percentage of various health issues.13 In addition, children born to those women who had been infected with flu were three to seven times more likely to develop schizophrenia later in life.
