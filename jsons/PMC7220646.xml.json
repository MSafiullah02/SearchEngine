Blood test showed elevated levels of white blood cells (17,700 per ml) and high C reactive protein level (24,802 mg/ml [range 0\u20135]), while procalcitonin level was normal. Abdominal ultrasound revealed an acute cholecystitis with no free fluid in the abdomen. Temperature was 37.9\u00b0 Celsius (C) at admission. The patient was then admitted to our Surgical Department and antibiotic therapy was started with Ceftriaxone 2 g/24. The patient underwent urgent laparoscopic cholecystectomy 10 h after admission in the ER. A bile spilling from the gall bladder occurred during the laparoscopic procedure. Bile was collected and sent for microbiological examination. A surgical drain was place under the liver.",

Bile microbiological examination revealed the presence of multi-sensible Enterococcus faecium and Serratia marcescens. Antibiotic therapy was, therefore, switched to ampicillin and ciprofloxacin. Blood cultures resulted negative for sepsis. Following the onset of dry cough and slight desaturation (sO2 96%), the patient underwent the RNA SARS-CoV-2 test. She was transferred to an isolated unit where pharyngeal swab was done twice (immediately and after 24 h). After the double negative result, the patient went back to the surgical ward.",

Blood examination at this point showed normal white blood cell count, normal procalcitonin level, and slightly normal C reactive protein levels. Oxygen saturation was 96% without subjective dyspnea. The patient underwent a computed tomography (CT) of the chest and abdomen and revealed the presence of bilateral pneumonia with initial acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS).

Patients with abdominal pathology requiring urgent surgery could represent a potential cause of nosocomial spread of viral disease. Considering initial vague respiratory symptoms, the potential onset of respiratory distress can be underestimated from both medical and nursing staff. Giving the prolonged incubation period of the SARS-CoV-2 [3], an initial negative result of the pharyngeal swab can turn into a positive result few days later. Moreover, the concomitance of a surgical complication can delay the real understanding of the clinical features. Our initial experience of a false negative result for the RNA SARS-CoV-2 test has led the whole surgical unit to treat an infected patient with insufficient precautions causing the contagion of nurses and doctors [3].",

In the same way, all post-operative fevers should be kept in serious consideration and the pharyngeal swab test should be repeated several times unless a clinical explanation of the ongoing high temperature would be found. Since surgical stress could increase the viral load and make the healthy carrier more infectious, our suggestion is to treat every patients as a positive subject for RNA SARS-CoV-2 test to prevent the virus spread [4].",
