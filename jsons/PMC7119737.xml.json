The virus primarily infects and destroys alveolar macrophages, which are important in the host defence in the lungs. Therefore, PRRSV-infected pigs may be more susceptible to secondary infections. Since PRRSV occurs endemically in many countries and may influence the efficacy of host defence mechanisms, it is possible that a PRRSV infection interferes with the vaccination efficacy against PRV.",

In contrast, others described no influence of a PRRSV infection on the clinical signs of disease after infection with Pasteurella multocida, Haemophilus parasuis, S. suis or Salmonella cholerasuis (Cooper et al., 1995). In addition, Albina et al.

The pigs were born from unvaccinated sows and had no antibodies against PRV or PRRSV. Pigs were randomly allocated to two groups and housed separately. Six pigs were intranasally inoculated with 0.5 ml of PRRSV strain LV-TH at a concentration of 105\n TCID50/ml per nostril. Five control SPF pigs were left uninoculated. After 2 weeks both groups were vaccinated intramuscularly with 105\n plaque-forming units (PFU)/ml PRV strain M141. These pigs were subsequently challenged intranasally with 105\n PFU/ml NIA-3 virus, 8 weeks after PRV vaccination. Blood samples were taken weekly, starting 1 week before and then 2 weeks after the LV inoculation. Rectal temperatures were recorded daily for 25 days after LV inoculation and 25 days after PRV challenge. Body weights were recorded at weekly intervals for 3 months. Pigs were considered to have fever when body temperatures were above or equal to 40\u00b0C. Growth performance was assessed by calculating the mean relative daily gain (MRDG) in body weight according to Stellman et al. (1989). The ethical committee for animal experiments of ID-Lelystad approved the experiments (Table 1\n).",

The lymphoproliferative response tended to be quicker (not significantly) and longer (2 weeks) (P<0.05) in the PRV group than in the LV-PRV group after PRV vaccination. This lymphoproliferative response was also quicker (1 week) and consistently higher in the PRV group than in the LV-PRV group after PRV challenge (P<0.05). Furthermore, when we used in vitro PRV-stimulated PBMC, the cytolytic response against PRV reached a maximum in week 3 after PRV vaccination and week 5 after PRV challenge in the PRV-group, whereas the LV-PRV group did not (P<0.05). Later after vaccination and challenge, the cytolytic response was comparable in both groups. The same kinetics of the cytolytic response against PRV vaccination with M141 was described in an other study (De Bruin et al., 1998), which indicates that the LV-PRV group in this study did not reach a maximum level in the cytolytic response, whereas the PRV group did. When PBMC were used directly, we also observed a significantly higher cytolytic response against PRV on day 10 after PRV vaccination in the PRV group than in the LV-PRV group (P<0.05). These results indicate a mild immunosuppressive effect by the PRRSV infection on the development of a cellular immune response after PRV vaccination and challenge. An explanation for this lower T-lymphocyte response may be that PRRSV infects monocytes and macrophages, which may hamper efficient antigen-presentation and thereby suppressing the ability of PBMC to proliferate.",

(1992), who also observed an enhanced humoral response after challenge with PRV, after an earlier PRRSV infection. It is possible that PRRSV infection stimulates the humoral response. However, an explanation for this discrepancy is that we used a very potent vaccine strain, inducing protection and no increase of antibody-titres (Kimman et al., 1992, Kimman et al., 1994, De Bruin et al., 1998). We could not detect differences in protection against a PRV challenge between both groups, but a negative effect of a PRRSV infection on protection after PRV vaccination can not be excluded when less potent vaccine strains are used. However, the M141 vaccine strain was used, because this strain induced a high cellular immune response (De Bruin et al., 1998) and eventually negative effects of a PRRSV infection on the development of the cellular immune response could be measured very well.",

Although we measured fever after LV inoculation and PRV vaccination, we could not detect clinical signs of Aujeszky\u2019s disease after vaccination with M141 (a PRV mutant strain that causes mild clinical signs (Kimman et al., 1994, De Bruin et al., 1998)).
