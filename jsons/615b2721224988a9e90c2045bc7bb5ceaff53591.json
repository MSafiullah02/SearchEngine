            "text": "Influenza B virus (IBV) is a respiratory pathogen that infects humans and causes seasonal influenza epidemics. However, cellular response to IBV infection in humans and mechanisms of host-mediated restriction of IBV replication are not thoroughly understood. In this study, we used next-generation sequencing (NGS) to perform transcriptome profiling of IBV-infected human lung epithelial A549 cells at 0, 6, 12, and 24 h post infection (hpi) and characterized the cellular gene expression dynamics. We observed that more than 4000 host genes were differentially regulated during the study period, which included up regulation of genes encoding proteins, having a role in the innate antiviral immune responses, immune activation, cellular metabolism, autophagy, and apoptosis, as well as down regulation of genes involved in mitosis and cell proliferation. Further analysis of RNA-Seq data coupled with RT-qPCR validation collectively showed that double-strand RNA recognition pathways, including retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) and Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3), were substantially activated following IBV infection. Taken together, these results provide important initial insights into the intimate interaction between IBV and lung epithelial cells, which can be further explored towards elucidation of the cellular mechanisms in restriction or elimination of IBV infections in humans.",

            "text": "Influenza viruses are classified as types A, B, and C according to their distinct antigenic properties residing in two major structural proteins (matrix 1 and nucleocapsid) [1] . Recently, a new type of influenza virus with bovine as a primary reservoir, officially designated influenza type D, has been described [2, 3] . Among these influenza viruses, only influenza A and B viruses (IAV and IBV) are of medical importance. It has been well established that humans are the primary host and reservoir of IBV [4] [5] [6] [7] , although sporadic infection episodes of IBVs have been described in seals and pigs [8, 9] . In contrast, IAV circulates in various mammals including humans, swine, and migratory or domestic waterfowl [1] . IBV infection of humans can result in the same spectrum of clinical disease as IAV, ranging from mild to severe respiratory illness requiring immediate hospitalization and medical treatment [7, 10] . IBV-associated mortality has been frequently observed in seasonal influenza epidemics particularly in children and adolescents [11, 12] , and the rate of mortality can be comparable to IAV [13] . As with IAV, IBV contains eight segments of single-stranded negative-sense RNA. IBV evolves at an estimated rate of~2 \u00d7 10 3 nucleotide substitutions per site per year for hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) proteins [14] [15] [16] . This evolutionary rate is approximately 2-3 times slower than those observed in IAVs. Despite the relatively slow evolutionary rate, new antigenic variants of IBV can emerge, largely driven by genetic reassortment of co-circulating IBV strains [6, 17, 18] . IBV has evolved into two antigenically and genetically distinct lineages, Yamagata and Victoria [19, 20] . The antigenic diversity of IBVs has presented a significant challenge for the selection of an appropriate strain for annual vaccine production.",

Despite significant progress on the characterization of host responses to IAV infections in a range of in vitro cell cultures and in vivo animal models, the interplay between IBV infection and host cells especially human epithelial cells remains poorly understood. A high-resolution analysis of dynamic changes in cellular response following IBV infection is also not available. Of many different cellular response pathways, innate immune response is the first line of defense against viral infection. The innate immune response modulates multiple pathways to signaling viral infection, inducing inflammatory reactions, clearing virus, and presenting viral antigens to the host immune system. It also determines how and when the adaptive immune responses will be activated. Thus, a thorough investigation of the innate immune response to IBV infection will shed light on the pathogenicity of IBV and help understand the severity of influenza syndromes and mechanisms of IBV resistance and disease tolerance. Such studies will also further provide clues on how to interfere or prevent IBV infection in humans.",

Significantly, we observed that the double-stranded RNA sensing pathway, consisting of RIG-I and TLR3, played an essential role in detecting IBV infection. Interestingly, in addition to the antiviral innate immune response, we also found that IBV replication resulted in profound changes in gene transcriptions involving other cellular pathways including immune activation, cellular metabolism, autophagy, apoptosis, mitosis, and cell proliferation. Taken together, these results provide important initial insights into the interactions between IBV and human lung epithelial cells, which pave the way for further investigation of cellular mechanism in restriction or elimination of IBV infections in humans.",

Cell lines acquired from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC, Manassas, VA, USA) for this work included Human lung alveolar carcinoma epithelial cell line A549 (ATCC \u00ae CCL-185) cells, Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells (ATCC \u00ae CCL-34), and human embryonic kidney cells HEK293T (ATCC \u00ae CRL-3216). Cells were maintained in Dulbecco's minimum essential medium (DMEM) that was supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) (PAA Laboratories Inc., Dartmouth, MA, USA) and penicillin-streptomycin (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) (100 U/mL). MDCK cells were used initially to propagate IBV in T75 tissue culture flasks. Briefly, MDCK cells were cultured to reach only 60% to 70% confluence at the time of infection. After infection, fresh DMEM with 0.5 \u00b5g/mL tolylsulfonyl phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)-treated trypsin (Sigma, Saint Louis, MO, USA) was added for additional 3-day incubation at 37 \u2022 C with 5% CO 2 . The infected cell cultures were then frozen and thawed. The supernatant was spun at 500\u00d7 g for 10 min at 4 \u2022 C to remove the cellular debris, which was followed by traditional viral titration experiments in MDCK cells according to the method of Reed and Muench [23] . Note that DMEM supplemented with penicillin-streptomycin (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) (200 U/mL) and TPCK-treated trypsin (Sigma, Saint Louis, MO, USA) (1 \u00b5g/mL) was used as the virus growth medium.",

Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent, Palo Alto, CA, USA) was used to assess the quality of extracted RNA. RNA that passed the quality test was further processed for cDNA library construction by using a cDNA library prep kit (catalog number FC-122-1001; Illumina Inc.) according to the manufacturer's instruction. cDNA library construction and all other procedures were conducted in Genomics Core Research Facility (GCRF) at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL). Briefly, mRNAs were purified from the total RNA using oligo(dT) magnetic beads followed by fragmentation. The resultant mRNAs were reverse transcribed to cDNAs that were subjected to an end repair process followed by ligation to the adapters. After separation in agarose gel through electrophoresis, cDNA fragments with a size of about 200 bp were excised, extracted, and amplified by PCR using two primers that match the ends of adaptors. PCR-enriched samples were then sequenced by an Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx (GA IIx) sequencer in the GCRF at UNL.",

We then estimated enriched biological processes and pathways in up-regulated gene set and down-regulated gene set against the gene ontology (GO) database and KEGG pathway database respectively as a function of time following IBV infection. Overall, the number of significantly regulated genes increased over time. For all three time points post infection, a total of 4365 genes was differentially regulated. There are more up-regulated genes than down-regulated genes at each time point (Figure 1a ). The up-regulated genes (399, 1143, and 2600 genes at 6, 12, and 24 hpi respectively) are dominated by pathways and processes of the innate immune response to virus infection, followed by responses to small molecules, antigen processing and presentation, regulation of T and B cell activation, metabolism, and apoptosis ( Figure  2 , Table 1, and Table S1 ).

Interestingly, we did not observe expression of TLR7 and TLR8 at all time points in A549 cells probably because both genes are not expressed in this cell line as demonstrated in a previous study [33] .

However, we did not observe expression of TLR7/8 in A549 cells, and consistently, not many genes in the MHC-II signaling pathway were up regulated (Table S1 ). Future study that addresses MHC-II response to IBV infection should be pursued in cell lines expressing TLR7/8 molecule. ",

It is also surprising to observe that although TLR7 was not expressed, downstream genes of TLR7 pathway were up-regulated (MyD88, IRAK, and IRF7) ( Figure 3 and Table S1 ), which indicate there are alternative mechanisms to initiate a similar immune response at the absence of TLR7 molecule in A549 cells.

As summarized in Figure 5 , RT-qPCR data showed that only approximately 1.5-fold increase of IRF-3 gene expression was found in infected A549 cells at 12 and 24 hpi, respectively. Despite statistically significant differences of IRF3 gene expression observed at 12 and 24 hpi when compared to 0h hpi (p < 0.01), we viewed that IRF-3 gene expression was slightly increased in A549 cells in response to IBV infection. RT-qPCR data appeared to be in agreement with the RNA-Seq result where we found that the fold-change for IRF-3 when compared to 0h hpi was 1.16 (6 hpi), 1.38 (12 hpi), and 1.14 (24 hpi), respectively (data not shown). For IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b17, similar to what was observed in RNA-Seq experiment (Figure 3 ), these two genes were not significantly up regulated until 24 hpi ( Figure 5) . Overall, these RT-qPCR data as summarized in Figures 4 and 5 are in agreement with those obtained in our RNA-Seq experiment (Figure 3 ). were up regulated more than 100-fold ( Figure 3) . Furthermore, the expression levels of some wellcharacterized antiviral genes were significantly increased to protect cells from IBV infection. For instance, the myxovirus genes (Mx1 and Mx2), which are GTPases that block influenza A virus replication [37, 38] , were up regulated ~1200-fold at all three time points (Table S1 ). NOS2, which can induce the generation of reactive nitrogen species [39] , was up-regulated about 25-and 64-fold at 12 and 24 hpi, respectively (Table S1 ).

Previous studies on IAV infection revealed that both processes are modulated by certain key factors [36] . Host resistance genes improve protection via repressing viral replication with multiple mechanisms, while other genes can modulate disease tolerance by depressing the inflammatory reactions. To understand whether similar mechanisms are used for host resistance and tolerance to IBV infection, we examined the expression levels of reported key regulators in protecting cells from viral infection [36] . Our analysis showed that many genes that are important for repressing viral replication and assembly were up regulated more than 100-fold ( Figure 3) . Furthermore, the expression levels of some well-characterized antiviral genes were significantly increased to protect cells from IBV infection. For instance, the myxovirus genes (Mx1 and Mx2), which are GTPases that block influenza A virus replication [37, 38] , were up regulated~1200-fold at all three time points (Table S1 ). NOS2, which can induce the generation of reactive nitrogen species [39] , was up-regulated about 25-and 64-fold at 12 and 24 hpi, respectively (Table S1 ).",

Analysis of changes in this intrinsic antiviral pathway in response to IBV infection is critical to elucidate IBV-host interaction. In this study, we examined IBV infection induced response in human lung epithelial A549 cells, a well characterized cell system that responds to infection robustly and has been extensively used to investigate innate immune response of pathogens, including but not limited to Ebola virus [40] , Influenza A virus [41] [42] [43] , Aspergillus fumigatus [44] , Newcastle Disease Virus [45] . Our results generated a number of interesting observations. Upon IBV infection, we observed that both type I and III IFN responses were activated over time, which appeared to be triggered by dsRNA signaling pathways including RIG-I and TLR-3, The activation of RIG-1 and IFN response during IBV infection observed here (Figures 3 and 4) is similar to what has been described in previous studies [46, 47] . Furthermore, a robust type III IFN response in infected-A549 cells described in this work was also reported by previous studies in antigen presentation cells [46, 47] , indicating that type III IFN response may serve as one of the primary antiviral defenses against influenza infection [42] .",

It is assumed that cell cycle arrest can benefit viral replication. For instance, the transcription activity of DNA polymerase II (Pol II), which is required for the transcription of viral proteins, is higher in G0/G1 phase than other phases. The translation of viral proteins requires host-derived cap-dependent translation activity, which is optimal at G0/G1 phase. However, the mechanism of virus mediated host cell cycle arrest is still unclear. One hypothesis is that NS1 of IBV, similar to its counterpart in IAV, down-regulates the expression and activity of the Ras homologue gene family member A (RhoA) kinase [52] , a GTPase that is critical for G1/S phase transition. Overexpression of IAV NS1 can cause increased expression of both p27 and p21, which as a result down-regulates the expression of cyclin D [52] . IAV NS1 can also inhibit the catalytic activity of pRb, CDK4, and CDK6, which are important regulators of G1/S check point. In this study, we observed decreased expression of cyclin D2, CDK4, and CDK6, while the expression of p21 was up regulated. These observations are consistent with the above hypothesis, suggesting IBV may use the same mechanism for cell cycle arrest as that reported previously for IAV. Furthermore, the expression of genes functioning in S and M phases are down regulated, implying that IBV infection may slow down cellular processes such as DNA recombination, DNA replication, and chromosome segregation. However, further investigations are required to uncover the mechanisms of these regulations and how these regulations would help IBV to replicate in cells.",

Where rapid detection of IBV infection by TLR3 or RIG-1 observed in A549 cells is applicable to other epithelial cells, especially primary human epithelial cells, remains to be studied. In addition, future study also needs to consider employing epithelial cells having a full-spectrum of innate immune activators and regulators rather than TLR7/TLR8-deficient A549 cells.
