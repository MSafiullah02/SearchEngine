This transformation is driven by the information these measurements have contributed for a better understanding of the molecular definition of disease and of the mechanisms of efficacy and toxicity for new drugs. As this information is translated into accurate genomic biomarkers of efficacy and toxicity, drug development processes supported by these measurements are becoming more efficient. This transformation is exemplified in the conversion of P450 enzyme activity measurements to gene expression in drug metabolism studies, the measurement of cytokine and chemokine genomic expression levels as clinical markers, and the identification and evaluation of genomic biomarkers of nephrotoxicity. A good understanding of factors affecting qPCR measurements can simplify their implementation, as will highthroughput platforms for these assays. Drug Dev. Res. 62:151-158, 2004. ",

            "text": "Several approaches were developed before quantitative, real time PCR [Henco and Heibey, 1990; Landgraf et al., 1991] in order to convert the qualitative information in a PCR gel into quantitative results. While PCR products can be accurately quantified in gels, there is a fundamental limitation that prevents an accurate quantification of PCR products from reflecting accurately the original quantity of DNA or cDNA in a sample. Endpoint measurements of PCR products after 40 amplification cycles have a weak correlation with the original number of copies of template in the sample and this correlation is only attainable over a limited dynamic range [Powell and Kroon, 1992; Ferre, 1992] . Quantitative, real time PCR (qPCR) [Heid et al., 1996; Wittwer et al., 1997] was developed over the last decade as a tool to accurately measure template copy number. The theory behind this method is straightforward and only assumes that PCR efficiency is constant and close to 100% throughout the amplification cycles used [Livak and Schmittgen, 2001] . The number of copies of template in a sample is determined through the amplification cycle (C T ) at which the amplification product can be initially detected. Detection chemistries such as TaqMan [Livak et al., 1995] and SYBR Green [Morrison et al., 1998 ] allow detection of products within the logarithmic growth range of these reactions, as well as normalization in gene expression measurements to an endogenous control gene such as the number of copies of ribosomal (18S) RNA in a sample. TaqMan chemistries also allow multiplexing several real-time quantitative PCR reactions in the same reaction volume [Lee et al., 1999] . Multiplexing is a major advantage for accurate normalization, since it exposes PCR reactions for the quantification of the target and endogenous control genes to the same chemical matrix.",

Confirmatory measurements may be needed for either quantitative observations for gene expression changes or qualitative identification of the correct genomic sequence [Rajeevan et al., 2001] . This application underscores a critical difference between qPCR and hybridization: hybridization protocols are optimized around a compromise between sensitivity for detection of hybridization to all sequences in an array and specificity for hybridization to individual se-quences, while universal protocols for qPCR are developed around a level of PCR efficiency and the requisite binding of fluorescent probes such as TaqMan that minimize detection of non-specific amplification products.

Caldesmon cDNA platform hybridization results showed decreases in gene expression results compared with their controls. By contrast, the Affymetrix oligonucleotide platform showed increases in expression levels for these samples. In the case of caldesmon, there was a 74-base sequence in the cDNA clone showing a 4100fold suppression relative to the day 7 high-dose methapyrilene-pooled control.

A conventional approach to assess cytochrome P450 (CYP) induction in preclinical animal models involves daily dosing for at least a week followed by Western blot and/or enzyme activity analysis. This study simultaneously assessed gene expression by qRT-PCR, along with Western blots and enzyme activity assays as a time course in an in vivo model. Rats were dosed daily for 8 days with model inducers of CYP1A, CYP2B, CYP3A, or CYP4A. Liver P450 levels were measured after 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 8 days of dosing by qRT-PCR, Western blot and enzyme activity. The results of the study showed that CYP1A, CYP3A, and CYP4A genes were maximally induced very rapidly (0.5-1 day), whereas the CYP2B gene was maximally induced after a lag time of 4 days. In all cases, fold changes in induction detected by qRT-PCR were greater than fold changes in protein levels and enzyme activities. Maximal persistent and larger fold changes observed by qRT-PCR either preceded or occurred simultaneously with maximal sustained fold changes in protein levels as measured by Western blots and enzyme activity assays. These data showed that qRT-PCR provides increased sensitivity and specificity over conventional assays and may be key information for reliable assessment of drug-related changes in CYP induction during the transition from discovery to toxicology studies.",

It anchors changes reported in levels of genomic biomarkers on histological data and supports claims showing that novel biomarkers are either more sensitive or specific than currently accepted markers. It also provides validation across species for the proposed biomarkers. Gene expression measurements across species are possible with qRT-PCR because primers can be designed for sequences conserved across these species. In the report by Davis et al. [2004] , the expression of several monkey genes was measured with primers designed for sequences conserved between rat and human genes. High-efficiency qRT-PCR requires a match between primer design for conserved regions from two known sequences and the actual sequence of a third, previously unknown, genomic sequence. The requirement for an approximation of 100% efficiency in qRT-PCR makes the sequence match an absolute requirement for this genomic platform and also facilitates its validation. The slope of a graph showing the C T value as a function of template dilution for the known and unknown sequences can be used to validate the choice of primer sequences. An ever-increasing knowledge of genomic sequences for species of interest in drug safety evaluation will reduce the need for this approach of primer design for qRT-PCR.",

            "text": "The development of qRT-PCR assays is closely linked to a few straightforward rules that were validated early in the development of this technology [Livak and Schmittgen, 2001] . The ''plug-and-play'' character of qRT-PCR requires the following: 1. A Taq polymerase enzyme reaction at maximum efficiency. The chemical matrix in commercially available master mixes is optimized for maximum rate and stability of different Taq enzymes. 2. Primer and probe design with accurate T m s for the chemical matrices in commercially available master mixes. Primer and probe design software product such as Primer Expresst [Livak and Schmittgen, 2001] are matched with master mixes supplied by each vendor. 3. Maximum PCR efficiency throughout the range of C T s over which expression results are needed. This is critical for relative quantification. Specific methods have been developed [Meijerink et al., 2001] to compensate for the effect of sample matrix effects on these measurements. 4. Choice of endogenous control gene for relative quantification. The only reason why an endogenous control gene should be chosen is that its expression remains unchanged throughout a study and depends exclusively on the total amount of RNA in a sample. An excellent choice as an endogenous control gene is 18S RNA because its expression level is essentially constant. An endogenous control gene should not be chosen for the proximity of its expression to that of the target gene. This approach will prevent accurate multiplexing. 5. Disengagement of the reverse transcriptase and Taq polymerase reactions. The optimization of master mixes for these two reactions is only possible if they are considered independently of each other. Single-step qRT-PCR chemistries compromise the sensitivity and dynamic range of qRT-PCR. A valuable asset for any lab interested in quantitative gene expression measurements is the long-term storage of relatively stable reverse transcription cDNA products for individual test samples.",

Regardless of the commercial source of qPCR reagents, this basic physicochemical logic has been retained, so that any assay for any genomic target may be assembled with primer and probe design software for high-efficiency PCR reactions. Hybridization platforms, whether oligonucleotide-or cDNA-based, are often proprietary in menu, configuration, labeling, and hybridization chemistries, and in hybridization and analysis hardware and software. Hybridization platforms also focus on the density of information available from hundreds of simultaneous gene expression results but not necessarily on the sensitivity, specificity, and dynamic range of the method.
