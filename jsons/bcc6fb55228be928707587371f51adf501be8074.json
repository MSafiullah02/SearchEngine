The headband was adapted from the open source PRUSA RC2 model in order to be easily and rapidly custom built in (polylactic acid (PLA) or acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) material using commercially available 3D printers. The face shield itself consisted in a standard transparent polymerizing vinyl chloride (PVC) sheet for overhead projectors, 200-300 \u03bcm-thick, perforated to be plugged easily into the 4 spikes of the headband, which was secured on the head by a simple dry-goods elastic band(Fig 1).Before use, headbands were disinfected by standard anti-viral decontamination procedures approved by our hospital's hygiene department. The transparent sheet was changed on demand and between each patient. The complete process was approved by the 3D4care consortium and the University hospitals of Paris. All the technical details are in open-access on the website of the consortium at www.3D4care.org.",

In some interventions, two interventional radiologists working together participated to the evaluation, being both equipped with the protective face shieldThe training level of the interventional radiologists were attending physicians (n = 21), fellows (n = 6) and residents (n = 11).

The mean ability to perform the assigned intervention as usual was 1.7 \u00b1 0.8 (SD) (range: 1-4). The mean visual tolerance rating was 1.6 \u00b1 0.7 (SD) (range: 1-4). The mean tolerability rating was 1.4 \u00b1 0.7 (SD) (range: 1-3.
