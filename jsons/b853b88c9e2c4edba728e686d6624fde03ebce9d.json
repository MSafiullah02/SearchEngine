Spectroscopic and microscopic techniques characterized the composite membrane. The X-ray diffraction confirms the anatase phase of titanium dioxide nanoparticles of crystalline size 15.89 nm. The effect of titanium dioxide concentration on the thermodynamical and rheological properties on the polyvinylidene fluoride casting solution was investigated by the triangle phase diagram and viscosity measurement. It was concluded that titanium dioxide introduction caused thermodynamic enhancement, but the impact of rheological hinderance was higher at high concentrations. The polyvinylidene fluoride/titanium dioxide membranes were used as a bi-functional membrane to evaluate the rejection of chromium (VI) from wastewater; then, they were applied as sunlight-active catalyst membrane to reduce the concentrated chromium (VI) to chromium (III) by reduction. It was concluded that at 0.02 wt% of titanium dioxide, the maximum rejection of 85.59% and a% reduction of 92% was achieved with enhanced flux.",

Over a decade, the chromium (VI) is considered as significant contaminants causing health risks among living beings (Loryuenyong et al. 2014) . The different source for the existence of hexavalent chromium includes leather tanning, chromate production, paint making and electroplating having discharge concentration ranging from 2000 to 5000 mg/mL but recommended permissible limit is only 2 mg/mL (Belay 2010) . One solution to eradicate carcinogenic chromium (VI) is to convert into a non-toxic Cr (III) state, which is also an essential trace metal as human nutrition. The conventional chemical technique needs expensive reducing agents like ferrous sulfate, sodium hydrogen sulfite, sodium pyrosulfite and hydrazine hydrate. Also, they are harmful to living beings, human skin and release unwanted chemicals (Dhala et al. 2013) .

            "text": "Recently, membrane separation has been widely used to treat wastewater. The low permeate flux with high operating pressure increases the cost in the case of reverse osmosis (RO) and nanofiltration (NF). Hence, ultrafiltration processes are preferred more as they work at low transmembrane pressures with lower operating costs. However, the use of membrane can only remove Cr (VI) ions from permeate and is acceptable according to environmental standards, but Cr (VI) concentration goes on increasing overtime at the retentate side and needs to be treated further before discharging to the environment. This problem intensifies more when the membrane recovery is below 50%. An alternative to the membrane separation technique is the use of highly efficient emergent technology (photocatalyst material) to treat wastewater in the presence of solar irradiation. The use of nanomaterial as photocatalyst is on demand due to its unique feature of having a high surface area to volume. However, the direct application of nanomaterial in suspended form for Editorial responsibility: J. Aravind. water treatments is inappropriate for recycling. From practical point of view, if the membrane surface is modified during synthesis procedure by incorporating photocatalyst material within the polymer matrix (Ramasundaram et al. 2016) to develop a hybrid material, coupling membrane separation and photocatalyst technology could present an integrated approach which not only eliminate Cr (VI) from wastewater but also reduce it to non-toxic Cr (III) form. Use of hybrid membrane (nanocomposite membrane), i.e., adding the highly photoactive nanomaterial (inorganic component) to the organic component led to their good performance. The use of nanocomposite membranes not only results in enhanced flux with high removal efficiency but also eliminates the fouling tendency of the membrane, increases the mechanical strength, thereby increasing the life span of membrane material (Nayak et al. 2016) . At the same time, problem associated with poor recoverability of powdered material after treatment is also removed.",

            "text": "Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) is a widely used polymer (organic component) for the ultrafiltration process because of its excellent resistivity against organic and inorganic acids and easy processability. However, being hydrophobic, the easy membrane fouling tendency affects the selective efficiency, and the chemical cleaning operations further increases its instability and deteriorates the sieving efficiency. The drawbacks can be eliminated by using different techniques including graft polymerization, chemical grafting, and surface coating membrane has been used to improve the surface hydrophilicity (Arif et al. 2019 ), but the weak interaction between polymer and additives affects the durability of the membrane (Salimi and Yousefi 2013) . The incorporation of photocatalysis material into the polymer matrix is gaining interest. It is an effective approach to enhance membrane hydrophilicity, thereby improving the water flux and simultaneously antifouling and self-cleaning property (Mo et al. 2007 ). Among different types of nanoparticles existing, e.g., titanium dioxide (TiO 2 ) nanoparticles (NPs) , Al 2 O 3 (Yan et al. 2009 ), carbon nanotubes (Brunet et al. 2011) , ZnO , nano-sized TiO 2 is of high demand because of facile synthesis, excellent hydrophilicity and antibacterial property. In this research, the effect of green route synthesized TiO 2 loading on PVDF membrane efficacy was evaluated. The novelty of this study involves the first time use of an extract of Cajanus cajan (obtained easily from kitchen waste thus avoiding the use of a costly chemical reducing agent) to synthesize NPs. The synthesized particle will be used as a filler to enhance the property of polymeric membrane used for ultrafiltration application in terms of porosity, pore size, thermal stability, flux and separation efficiency. The presence of active substance terpenoids, aliphatic, and aromatic amines (active substance) in extract result in efficient stabilization and avoid agglomeration of NPs. Most of the literature reported the removal of Cr (VI) either using either a membrane or photocatalytic removal technique. Using a membrane as such leads to increases in Cr (VI) concentration on the retentate site; hence, further treatment is required to treat it before discarding, thus increasing the operation cost. In case of using photocatalyst material, the additional cost occurs because of difficulty in the recovery of photocatalyst material after the treatment. This study also includes the application of synthesized nanocomposite membrane to be used as bi-functional membrane for ultrafiltration application. The bi-functional membrane will not only reject but also reduce Cr (VI) leading to the potential recovery of non-toxic Cr (III) using same inorganic-polymer material and retaining its efficiency even after several runs, thus reducing the processing cost. Thus the membrane performance was defined in terms of chromium (VI) rejection and subsequently to retreat the concentrated chromium (VI) called retentate at the end of the filtration process to remove toxicity by reducing Cr (VI) to Cr (III) a non-toxic element.",

The presence of NPs in the polymeric solution induces the formation of smaller and run-through pores and suppresses the formation of macro-voids (Ya-nan et al. 2008) . In addition to it, they improve the porosity, permeability, and enhance the thermal stability and antifouling property. In this work, the effect of synthesized TiO 2 NPs on the formation of the porous structure in poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF)/N methyl pyrrolidone (NMP), solvent)/water (non-solvent) system via phase separation was investigated via immersion precipitation knowing that thermodynamics and kinetics are parameters are dependent on inorganic fillers. In the literature, two methods were reported to understand the kinetics of membrane fabrication, namely (i) the light transmission technique and (ii) the optical microscope technique (Kim and Lee 1998; Reuvers and Smolders 1987) . It was concluded by Strathmann et al. (1975) that the square of distance moved by the boundary shows a linear relationship with coagulation time; therefore, Fickian diffusion law confirms the diffusion kinetics. Kang et al. (1991) further demonstrated the equation as Squaring both sides in Eq. (4) where Y represent the distance moved by the boundary (mm), t the coagulation time (s), and D e represents diffusion factor (mm 2 /s) In the membrane fabrication, the viscosity of the polymeric casting solution is an important parameter influencing the surface morphology and cross section of the membrane because it affects the exchange rate between solvent and non-solvent (Zheng et al. 2006 ). The viscosity test and cloud-point method were used to study the effect of incorporating synthesized TiO 2 NPs on the rheological and thermodynamic properties of PVDF casting solution, whereas the kinetic parameter was evaluated based on the relationship between the thickness of wet membrane and coagulation time.",

Two methods were reported in the literature to estimate the antibacterial activity: i) sterilization ratio calculation (Chong et al. 2017 ) and direct observation via FESEM . In this study, E. coli was used as the model foulant for the antimicrobial tests. Before the experiment, all the materials were autoclaved at 120 \u00b0C for 60 min to ensure sterility. E. coli was cultivated in a conical flask composed of 100 ml sterilized solution of nutrient broth kept in an incubator maintained at 37 \u00b0C for 1 day at 150 rpm to allow bacteria to grow fully. The overnight grown bacterial species were centrifuged for 15 min at 6000 rpm thrice to remove culture media and resuspended in sterilized DI water. UV-treated membrane pieces (0.01 m \u00d7 0.01 m) were taken and immersed in the cultivated E. coli suspension and placed in an incubator at 37 \u00b0C for 18 h. After that, the membranes were removed from the suspension, and 0.1 mL of the E. coli suspension was spread on an agar nutrient plate composed of 1.3 g of nutrient broth and 2.3 g of nutrient agar (NA) per 100 mL of distilled water and placed in the incubator for overnight. The number of colonyforming units (CFUs) on the plate was calculated using Eq.

Figure 4a depicts that the membranes are thermally stable up to 300 \u00b0C and then degradation starts. The weight loss for the neat PVDF membrane (PM1) begins at 290 \u00b0C, and for PVDF/TiO 2 , it starts from 450 \u00b0C. It was also observed that the thermal stability of the PVDF/TiO 2 is higher than the pure PVDF membrane and increases with an increase in the concentration of NPs. The significant weight loss was observed in the range from 400 to 500 \u00b0C which is assigned to the degradation of PVDF polymer. The weight loss decreases with an increase in TiO 2 loading attributed to the interaction of TiO 2 with the polymer matrix, and this interaction leads to delay in the diffusion of the volatile compound out of the polymer thereby enhancing the thermal decomposition temperature (defined as the temperature at 3-4% weight loss).

The interaction between the macromolecular chain of the polymer and TiO 2 will restrain the state of PVDF chains, resulting in increases in the rigidity of polymer chains and restricting their thermal action; hence, the melting temperature of the composite membrane increases. The decreased value in the case of PM4 is due to agglomeration of a particle at high concentration reducing the surface-to-volume ratio; hence, contribution of interfacial effects will hinder the thermal characteristics (Nor et al. 2016) . Figure 5a shows the UV-Vis spectra of PVDF and PVDF/ TiO 2 membranes. The figure depicts that absorption capability of pure PVDF is minimal, as it did not absorb any light in the range 200 to 500 nm compared to TiO 2 incorporated membranes toward UV radiation which indicates an excellent optical response of PVDF/TiO 2 membranes to UV irradiation (Nor et al. 2016) . This is attributed to nanoparticle-polymer ionic interaction (Sharma et al. 2018) .

The membrane of different thickness was fabricated by adjusting the clearance between the casting knife and glass plate and the stopwatch used to record the coagulation time at ambient temperature. The plot between the square of membrane thickness and coagulation time and its regression analysis is as shown in Fig. 6b , and its error analysis detail is given in Table 2 . The figure depicts a linear relationship between coagulation time and the square of wet membrane thickness. The line equation can be written as Eq. (10) Since the coagulation time was always more than 10 s, the intercept (4.01316 \u00d7 10 \u22124 ) always less than 1% can be neglected, and the equation can be rewritten as Comparing Eqs. (5) and (11) where Y represents the membrane thickness (mm), t coagulation time (s), D e kinetic parameter (mm 2 s \u22121 ), defined as diffusing rate of solvent and non-solvent. Similarly, D e value for other PVDF/TiO 2 membranes was calculated. It was well known that the composition of the casting solution strongly influences the kinetics of the membrane. At constant coagulation bath temperature, the solution viscosity increases with increasing concentration of TiO 2 ; however, D e value rises up to TiO 2 loading 0.02 wt % and maximum value of 0.023 mm 2 s \u22121 for PM3 membrane was achieved, and then, D e value decreases on the further increase. The change in D e with the TiO 2 concentration was due to thermodynamic and rheological properties. The addition of TiO 2 enhances the thermodynamic property due to an increased demixing rate. But at maximum loading (PM4-0.3 wt % TiO 2 ), the increased viscosity creates a negative impact on D e because of the increased viscosity slows down the exchange rate.",

Figure 7a depicts that the observed contact angle of PVDF/TiO 2 membranes is lower than the neat PVDF membrane. It is due to a high hydrophilic characteristic of TiO 2 NPs. It was observed that the contact angle value declines from 94.9 to 77.2\u00b0 as TiO 2 loadings increase from 0 to 0.3 wt %. Similar results were also reported by Arif et al. (2019) . These results suggest that hydrophilicity is improved for the PVDF/TiO 2 composite. The opposite trend to contact angle for porosity and pore size was observed (Fig. 7b , c). The porosity increases from approx. 74 to 85%, and the difference in porosity for PM1 and PM2 is more tangible compared to PM3 and PM4. It is due to a decrease in the rate of increasing porosity due to increased viscosity of the solution, which reduces the exchange of mass transfer rate between solvent and non-solvent, thus reducing the porosity and hence the pore size, with increasing inorganic TiO 2 concentration. The results were supported by the kinetic study also. As already mentioned that inverse relationship exists between tortuosity and porosity. Figure 7d also shows a similar trend where tortuosity decreases with an increase in TiO 2 loadings.",

The figure depicts that there was an abundance growth of E. coli in the case of PM1 (control). On the other hand, TiO 2 -incorporated membrane viability of E. coli was very less compare to pure PVDF, and in the case of PM3 and PM4, there was hardly any growth of E. coli on the plates. These results suggest that the sterilization effect of the membranes was excellent. The HRSEM images confirm the antimicrobial activity of the membranes. A shown in Fig. 8c , a dense layer of E. coli was observed on the surface of pure PVDF, which is not the case with TiO 2 incorporated PVDF membrane, and a significant antimicrobial efficacy was observed with increasing TiO 2 loading. It is attributed to the cell wall disruption due to the presence of NPs (Belay 2010) . At low concentration, for the PM2 membrane, the surface was not entirely covered with NPs, therefore, allowing few bacteria to grow. In the case of PM3, the optimum loading results in intimate contact between TiO 2 NPs and the bacteria but further increase in loading (PM4); the agglomeration of particles leads to non-uniform distribution within the polymer matrix hence provides a surface for bacteria to grow. Figure 9a shows that with increasing TiO 2 loading water, flux increases. It is due to the incorporation of hydrophilic TiO 2 NPs and increased porosity, as shown in Fig. 7a , c also, but for the PM4 membrane, the flux declines due to decreased porosity attributed to delayed mixing rate with increased viscosity, which is also justified from the results shown in Fig. 6c . Figure 9b depicts the % rejection for feed solution containing Cr (VI) for different membranes. It was observed that % rejection was very less for pure PVDF membrane and increased with an increase in TiO 2 loading, and nearly 85.59% chromium rejection was achieved. It is mentioned in various literature that separations are influenced by the presence of charge on the membrane, the concentration of solute, ionic interaction of inorganic filler with the membrane (Jyothi et al. 2017) .",

The increased % rejection with increasing loading is due to increased surface charge of on the membrane; also the presence of hydrophilic TiO 2 NPs increases water flux but further increase in loading in case of PM4 membrane excess loading creates negative impact the on rejection percentage due to widening of pores (sponge-like pores) as mentioned in an earlier section and will also lower the flux due pore plugging and hinder diffusion (Jyothi et al. 2017 ).",

The figure depicts that the membrane without a significant change retains its reusable capacity, but at the end of the 5th cycle, the PM3 membrane loses its strength due to applied pressure during separation hence was not used further.

Also, after deep investigation, a comparative analysis is carried out to compare the efficiency of other used techniques with the synthesized membrane in this work as listed in Table 3 . It is seen that the bi-functional membrane presents a promising approach with different techniques. Compared to other technique reported in the literature, the % removal is maximum at pH \u02f76 without much compromising in removal efficiency even after 5 runs and almost achieving best result when compared to commercial available expensive membrane technique (nanofiltration (NF) and reverse osmosis (RO), and this may broaden the horizon for treatment of tannery wastewater using bi-functional membrane technology.",

The effect of different loading TiO 2 results concludes that at optimal loading TiO 2 (PM3-0.02 wt %) maximum rejection of 85.59% and reduction 92% was achieved. The influence of TiO 2 on membrane morphology was also studied by investigating the thermodynamic and kinetic parameters. It was concluded that thermodynamic enhancement accelerated the phase separation with increasing TiO 2 loading, thereby enhancing the porosity and water flux, but at maximum loading (PM4-0.03 wt %) the rheological hinderance becomes more prominent due to increased viscosity hence delaying the mixing rate and reducing the pore size formation; thus, there exists a tradeoff relation between thermodynamic and kinetic parameter.",
