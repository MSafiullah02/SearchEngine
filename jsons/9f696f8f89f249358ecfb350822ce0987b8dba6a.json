Better results have been obtained in a group of vomiting pet dogs. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness (bacterial eradication rates and clinical response) of triple therapy, with and without acid suppression, in dogs with chronic vomiting and gastric Helicobacter spp. infection.",

Dogs were further stratified on the basis of normal biopsies, gastritis, and / or inflammatory bowel disease. Owners maintained a daily record of clinical signs. Four weeks after completing treatment, endoscopy was performed and biopsy samples collected for histopathological evaluation.

The significance of decreased TCR\u2425\u2426\u03e9 cells in IBD remains unknown; however, this observation offers new perspective into the aberrant mucosal immune response characteristic of canine IBD. Canine leukocyte adhesion deficiency (CLAD) is a primary immune disorder inherited as an autosomal recessive that is caused by a dysfunction of leukocyte adhesion with, among other effects, the inability of neutrophils to extravasate to sites of infection. Fourteen years ago we reported the first CLAD in a cross-bred Irish Setter from Pennsylvania and recognized that the previously described canine granulopathy syndrome in an Irish Setter from Washington State may have been the same disease. Recently, CLAD was also identified in Irish Setter puppies from Sweden and the responsible missense mutation (Cys36Ser) was found in the \u24242 integrin gene that codes for a common subunit (CD18) of several dimeric adhesion molecules. We describe here the clinical course and molecular basis of the disease in our originally described Irish Setter. We also surveyed a closely related breed, Irish Red and White Setters, in the United States for the presence of the \u24242 integrin mutation.",

We developed a test based on a HinfI restriction digest that yields an internal control fragment and different length fragments in the affected and control animals. In a group of 19 Irish Red and White Setters from the U.S. tested to date, we found two littermates whose father was British that are carriers for the same \u24242 intgrin mutation. Irish Setters carrying this mutation have also been found in several European countries and in Australia. In conclusion, this study documents the presence of the same \u24242 integrin mutation seen in Europe and Australia in the first dog described with CLAD as well as in the Irish Red and White Setter breed. Phosphofructokinase (PFK) is a key regulatory enzyme in anaerobic glycolysis, the essential energy-producing pathway of erythrocytes and muscle. An autosomal recessive inherited muscle-type PFK deficiency characterized predominantly by chronic compensated hemolytic anemia with intermittent hemolytic crises and to a lesser extent exertional myopathy has been identified in the English springer spaniel (ESSP). Canine PFK-deficient erythrocytes have reduced 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (DPG) content, which increases their hemoglobin-oxygen affinity and alkaline fragility.

At necropsy, multifocal vascular dystrophic mineralization and severe multifocal chronic active necrosis with mineralization involving the heart, subcutis, and muscle were noted in this dog that failed to engraft. Correction of the erythrocyte M-PFK deficiency was documented by measuring erythrocyte PFK activity and 2,3-DPG levels and by a PCR that identified normal, heterozygous, and mutant PFK alleles. M-PFK activity in muscle tissue remained absent, however, the change in erythrocyte function improved the ability to deliver oxygen to muscle during work as assessed by near infrared spectroscopy.

At the time of admission in May, March and October respectively, they were 31, 12 and 12 months of age and the duration of illness was 14, 2, and 3 days. All 3 cats were examined because of acute onset of lethargy and inappetance. Cryptococcosis was diagnosed in C-1 and systemic lupus erythematosus in C-2 at 18 and 7 months of age. Physical examination abnormalities included fever (41.1, 40.2 C) in C-1 & C-2, moderate stifle joint effusion (C-1), generalized lymphadenopathy (C-2) and pallor, petechiae and blindness (C-3). Ocular abnormalities included chemosis, conjunctivitis and protrusion of the third eye lid in C-1, and multifocal retinal hemorrhage with bilateral retinal detachment in C-3. Clinicopathologic testing identified numerous abnormalities including neutrophilia with a regenerative left shift and neutphilic polyarthritis in C-1, pancytopenia with reactive lymphadenopathy in C-2, and a normocytic normochromic non-regenerative anemia and thrombocytopenia in C-3. A core bone marrow biopsy revealed erythroid and megakaryocytic hypoplasia in both C-2 and C-3. Due to the predominance of early myeloid precursors in C-2, acute myeloid leukemia or immune-mediated myelodysplasia were the main differential diagnoses. All 3 cats were negative for FeLV, FIV and various other infectious diseases. Antinuclear antibodies were detected in the two cats tested (C-1 & C-2). By IFA testing, reciprocal antibody titers to E. canis antigens were \u03fd16 for C-1 and C-2. Using primers ECCmod and HE3R mod, 380 bases of the 16S rRNA gene were amplified, cloned and sequenced. The resulting sequence from all three cats was identical, except for 2 bases in C-1, to the homologous sequence for E. canis. Treatment with doxycycline, and other drugs, elicited clinical improvement in all 3 cats, but the concurrent use of immunosuppresive drugs for the presumptive diagnoses of immune-mediated polyarthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus and immune-mediated anemia and thrombocytopenia may have interfered with therapeutic elimination of the organism. We conclude that cats can be infected with E. canis, without developing an IFA E. canis antibody response.",

Evaluation of airway lavage samples is useful in characterizing many respiratory diseases, however C. immitis organisms are reportedly rare in cytologic specimens, and the diagnostic efficacy of airway sampling in coccidioidomycosis is unknown. Allergic asthma in humans and cats is associated with development of reversible airway obstruction, nonspecific airway hyperreactivity, and histologic evidence of airway remodeling. We hypothesize that allergic airway responses in cats, similar to humans, are associated with CD4\u03e9 T cells predominantly expressing Th2 cytokines. Cats sensitized to house dust mite allergen (HDMA; 3 cats) or bermuda grass allergen (BGA; 3 cats) were used to determine the cytokine pattern of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) cells using real-time TaqMan reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to quantify cytokine messenger RNA (mRNA) transcription. Baseline collection of PBMCs and BAL cells was performed prior to sensitization with parenteral and intranasal allergen over a 4 week period. Aerosolization of allergen in awake cats in a sealed chamber was then performed twice weekly for 7 treatments, and 48 hours after the last aerosol challenge, PBMCs and BAL cells were collected. Cytokines were quantitated from unstimulated BAL cells and PBMCs. Extracted RNA was reverse transcribed to create complementary DNA (cDNA) which was subsequently amplified using a realtime TaqMan PCR system.

In both BAL cells and PBMCs, the IL-12 p40 transcription was not affected. In addition, BAL cells for sensitized and challenged cats showed significantly suppressed transcription for the CD4 chemotactic cytokine IL-16 and increased transcriptional activity for the monocyte chemoattractant RANTES. Our preliminary data suggest cats sensitized with either HDMA or BGA display a type 2 cytokine profile, similar to what is reported in humans with asthma. Therapeutic intervention to manipulate the Th2 response may be useful in the modulation of allergic airway responses in the cat. Pulmonary intravascular macrophages (PIM) are resident phagocytic cells found in pulmonary capillaries of certain species of animals. These cells are important in the induction of acute lung injury (ALI) due to their location, phagocytic abilities, and secretory abilities. Sepsis is a major risk factor for acute lung injury, particularly in most species that have PIMs. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of serial, sublethal doses of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on phagocytic abilities and pathology of the lung and liver in the cat.",

            "text": "These severe R-amplitude reductions indicate that for canine practice an electrocardiograph with better high frequency response than that obtained with filters in an ECG machine designed for humans is needed. Electrocardiograms should preferably be recorded without filters. However, severe electrical noise artefacts sometimes necessitate the use of filters, indicating the need for specifically designed ECG-filters for veterinary use. The inverse relation between dog mass and the magnitude of R-amplitude reduction due to ECG-filters indicate the need for different ECG-machine characteristics for different size animals. Noise reversion is a protective algorithm used in pacemakers that causes asynchronous pacing when there is repetitive sensing in the ventricle that is faster than the noise reversion rate. The purpose is to prevent inappropriate pacemaker inhibition by electromagnetic interference, electrocautery, and myopotentials. Tachycardias can cause pseudo-nonsensing with asynchronous pacing due to noise reversion with the risk of capturing the ventricle during the vulnerable period resulting in ventricular fibrillation. The purpose of this report is to demonstrate that noise reversion pacing is a correctable complication in paced dogs. Four dogs with syncope and bradyarrhythmias that required pacing were studied. Each dog also had a tachyarrhythmia. After pacemaker implantation all dogs experienced inappropriate pacing. Noise reversion was confirmed by the marker channel recording as detected by a Medtronics programmer model 9790 (see figure) . To correct the noise reversion the refractory period and sensitivity were optimized (see table) for each dog after amplitude and pulse width strengthduration curves were examined. It was found that shortening the refractory period and decreasing the sensitivity prevented the retriggerable refractory period and inappropriate asynchronous pacing. It is important that this complication of inappropriate programming of pacemakers in dogs be differentiated from undersensing.

Although administration of frozen stored colostrum is often recommended as a method to provide immunoglobulins to neonatal calves, no previous study has critically examined serum immunoglobulin concentrations in calves fed fresh and frozen colostrum. A series of experiments were conducted to determine whether calves fed frozen stored colostrum (-20 C) have similar serum IgG concentrations to calves fed refrigerated stored colostrum (4 C). In experiment 1, 10 pairs of Holstein calves (20 calves) were fed 4 l matched aliquots of colostrum, which had either been frozen or stored at refrigerator temperatures at 3 hours of age. Serum IgG concentrations at 2 days of age were compared among the 2 groups using a paired t-test. No significant difference was observed between the two groups. In the second experiment, 26 calves were fed 4 l of either fresh (n \u03ed 13) or frozen (n \u03ed 13) colostrum. A series of regression models were developed which attempted to predict calf serum IgG concentration or a suitable transformation of serum IgG concentration at 2 days of age as a function of colostral IgG concentration or a transformed measurement of colostral IgG concentration and colostrum storage group. No significant relationship was observed between colostrum storage group and day 2 serum IgG concentration in any of the models explored. The model, which best-correlated serum IgG and colostral IgG concentrations, predicted serum IgG concentration squared as a function of log(colostral IgG concentration). In conclusion, our data suggests that administration of frozen colostrum is an appropriate strategy to provide immunoglobulins to neonatal calves. The objectives of this study were: 1) to describe the bacteria isolated from colostrum fed to newborn calves in commercial dairy herds, 2) to quantify the importance of the bacterial contamination 3) to evaluate association between bacterial contamination and the farm of origin, season of birth, calf's gender and dam's parity.",

Dietary bicarbonate supplementation appears to have no effect on the occurrence of rhabdomyolysis in RER horses. Sweat production during prolonged endurance exercise results in depletion of body fluid and electrolyte stores. As a consequence, horses may develop various medical problems described as the ''exhaustive disease syndrome''. Warning signs of exhaustion include muscle fasciculations and synchronous diaphragmatic flutter. These signs of neuromuscular irritability (NI) have traditionally been attributed to hypocalcemia and are often treated with small volumes of calciumcontaining solutions. Such treatment may counteract NI but does little to replace the large deficits of water and other electrolytes that are more likely the underlying cause. We tested the hypothesis that endurance exercise results in a decrease in [iCa \u03e9\u03e9 ] in two studies in which six 2-year-old Arabian horses exercised on a treadmill. In study 1, [iCa \u03e9\u03e9 ] decreased by 0.37 \u03ee 0.06 mg/dl (p\u03fd0.01) during 45 km of treadmill exercise but returned to the pre-exercise value by 20 minutes into the recovery period. Further, [iCa \u03e9\u03e9 ] was correlated (r \u03ed -0.21, p\u03fd0.01) with blood pH. In study 2, horses performed two 60 km exercise bouts-with and without electrolyte supplementation (NaCl and KCl oral pastes). Without electrolyte supplementation, [iCa \u03e9\u03e9 ] decreased by 0.50 \u03ee 0.16 mg/dl (p\u03fd0.01) after 60 km of exercise. In contrast, a decrease in [iCa \u03e9\u03e9 ] was not observed when horses were supplemented with NaCl and KCl. As in study 1, [iCa \u03e9\u03e9 ] was again correlated (r \u03ed -0.38, p\u03fd0.01) with blood pH. However, supplementation with electrolytes abolished the mild alkalosis that developed during prolonged exercise and, thereby, may have attenuated any decrease in [iCa \u03e9\u03e9 ]. In conclusion, these data suggest that moderate endurance exercise does not produce clinically significant hypocalcemia; rather, the observed decreases in [iCa \u03e9\u03e9 ] may simply be physiochemical consequence of changes in blood pH. Our hypothesis was that the composition of a meal fed before exercise would affect metabolism and substrate utilization during subsequent exercise. Therefore, we com-pared energy expenditure, rates of substrate oxidation, and glucose utilization by skeletal muscle during moderate intensity exercise in horses denied access to food for 18 hours and then: (1) fed cracked corn (1.7 kg for 450 kg horse, 5.6 Mcal digestible energy), or (2) fed an isocaloric amount of alfalfa cubes (3.0 kg for a 450 kg horse) 2-3 hours before exercise, or (3) not fed before exercise.",

Toxic products such as reactive oxygen intermediates released by activated neutrophils (PMN) have an important role in the pathophysiology of diseases associated with the deposition of immune complexes (IC) in tissues. IC-induced activation of PMN requires adhesion mediated by integrin adhesion receptors. Of the integrins expressed on PMN, the \u2424 2 family has been found to be of particular importance for activation of PMN by IC. \u2424 2 integrin ligand binding must be activated to enable adhesion to IC. Both activating and inhibitory signals regulate \u2424 2 integrin ligand avidity and adhesion. The second messenger cAMP has been demonstrated to inhibit the activation of PMN in response to a variety of stimuli. The purpose of this study is to test the hypothesis that cAMP-dependent signals inhibit \u2424 2 integrin dependent adhesion of equine PMN to immobilized IC and subsequent adhesion-dependent activation of respiratory burst activity.",

We used this method to test the hypothesis that GE is delayed following ingestion of a grain plus corn oil meal compared to a meal of grain alone. Four mature (10-12 yr) Arabian horses were studied in a 2 x 2 factorial design. Factor A was the habitual diet, either a control (CON; hay plus sweet feed [SWF]) or an isocaloric fat-supplemented diet (FAT; hay, SWF and corn oil). Factor B was the type of meal consumed for the GE test (SWF, 2 g/kg bwt. vs. SWF 2 g/kg bwt. plus 10% corn oil [OIL] ). Each diet period lasted 10 weeks, with 6 weeks in between. GE studies were performed during the 4 th and 8 th weeks in each period. Within each dietary period, and in random order, horses were tested in both the SWF and OIL conditions. The 4 treatment combinations being: CON/SWF, CON/OIL, FAT/SWF, and FAT/OIL. For assessment of solid-phase GE, the test meals were labeled with 1 g of 13 C-octanoic acid. Blood samples for measurement of plasma glucose concentration and 13 C-enrichment were collected at 30 min and immediately before ingestion of the test meal and at frequent intervals thereafter for 7 h.

Horses that are actively racing, are living at racetracks, are trotters or have poor body condition are more likely to have GU. Also, GU lesion score (grades 0-3) based on lesion size was found to also reflect the number of sites where lesions were found in the stomach. This further validates the scoring system with regards to its correlation with severity. The prevalence of Equine Gastric Ulcer Syndrome (EGUS) ranges from 60 to 90% in performance horses and results in decreased performance, loss of revenue and even death due to gastric rupture. The non-glandular mucosa, adjacent to the margo plicatus, of the horse stomach is most commonly affected. In a previous study, a volatile fatty acid (VFA) (acetic acid), a byproduct of carbohydrate fermentation, was shown to cause injury in the nonglandular gastroesophageal mucosa of pigs. Recently, VFAs (propionic, butyric, and valeric acids) were found in high concentration in the horse stomach and at a low stomach pH, these horses had increased numbers and more severe non-glandular gastric ulcers. To determine the effect of acetic, butyric, propionic, and valeric acids and pH on the nonglandular mucosa, thirty horses, free of clinical signs related to gastric disease, were euthanatized and their stomachs removed. The nonglandular mucosa was sharply dissected from the underlying submucosa and muscular layers and a 3.5 cm disc of tissue mounted in each of 12 Ussing's chambers. The mucosal surface was bathed in Ringer's solution (control) or Ringer's solution containing 60 mmol of either acetic, butyric, propionic, or valeric acid and pH of the solutions adjusted to 1.5, 4 or 7. Short circuit current (Isc) and potential difference (PD), indicators of sodium transport and tissue resistance, were recorded every 15 minutes for 3.5 hours. At the end of the experiment, the tissue was removed from the chambers, embedded in paraffin and stained with H&E. Butyric and propionic acids caused a significant (P\u03fd0.01) decrease in Isc and PD at a pH of 1.5 and 4, when compared to control, acetic acid, and the same solutions at pH 7.0. On histopathologic examination, butyric, propionic, and valeric acids caused cell swelling in the non-glandular mucosa at pH 4.0 and 1.5. In addition, valeric acid caused cell swelling at pH 7. Butyric, propionic, and valeric acids, because of their high lipid solubility and ability to remain undissociated at a low pH, may diffuse into the nonglandular mucosal cells, causing cell acidification and damage to sodium transport, which results in cell swelling, necrosis, and ulceration. Volatile fatty acids produced in the stomach of horses may contribute to the pathogenesis of EGUS.

We report a new muscular dystrophy in five young male Japanese Spitz dogs. Clinical signs were first observed at 10-12 weeks of age. There was excess salivation and dysphagia, a slow onset of exercise intolerance, an abnormal gait and pain on palpation of muscles.

CSF analysis is a common diagnostic tool for patients with neurologic disease. It can be diagnostic in a few isolated diseases but is generally non-specific. CSF analysis has the potential for providing additional information. Matrix Metalloproteinases (MMPs) are calcium-and zinc-dependent endoproteinases with overlapping substrates that hydrolyze at least one component of the tissue extracellular matrix. MMPs are important in normal physiologic processes such as angiogenesis and wound healing. MMPs play a role in pathological processes that involve unregulated matrix destruction such as arthritis and neoplasia. One class of MMPs, the gelatinases, degrade gelatin and type IV collagen. These include MMP2 and MMP9. Gelatinases have been shown to play a role in multiple CNS diseases. MMP2 is known to be constituitively produced in human CSF while MMP9 is present only in certain pathologic conditions such as multiple sclerosis, neoplasia, and inflammatory diseases. We hypothesize that MMP2 is present in normal canine CSF while MMP9 is absent. CSF (23) samples were taken from normal dogs. Each CSF sample was evaluated immediately for RBC and WBC numbers, protein, glucose, and cytology. CSF samples were considered normal if the protein was \u03fd 25 mg/dl, WBC \u03fd 6 cells/mcl, and RBC \u03fd 25 cells/mcl. Each dog was euthanized and the brains evaluated by routine histopathology.

The basic EEG pattern of the hydrocephalic dogs was characterized by a high amplitude of 117.6 \u03ee 36.8 V and a low frequency of 2.6 \u03ee 0.7 Hz. The mean amplitude of the hydrocephalic dogs differed significantly (p\u03fe 0.05) from control dogs (37 \u03ee 4.2 V). A superior separation between hydrocephalic and control dogs was achieved by comparing the frequency of the superimposed pattern. Dogs with hydrocephalus had a significantly (p\u03fe 0.0001) lower mean frequency (5.1 \u03ee 1.4 Hz) than the control dogs (15 \u03ee 1 Hz). To our knowledge, this is the first study proving that quantitative measurement of the superimposed low amplitude fast activity pattern adds important information. A focal paroxysmal spindle activity (73.6 \u03ee 20.1 V, 12.7 \u03ee 1.8) was noticed only in two dogs suffering from grand mal seizures. In hydrocephalic dogs, there was a significant inverse correlation (r \u03ed -0.56, p\u03fe0.05) between the age at presentation and the amplitude of basic pattern. Additionally, a significant correlation (r \u03ed 0.66, p\u03fe0.05) was established between age at presentation and frequency of the basic EEG pattern. The diagnostic tests currently used to diagnose myasthenia gravis (MG) in dogs include pharmacological testing with edrophonium chloride, repetitive nerve stimulation and detection of serum anti-acetylcholine receptor (AchR) antibodies. The first two tests are relatively nonspecific and insensitive. Detection of AchR antibodies is a sensitive and specific test for most cases of MG but seronegative MG has been described in dogs. In people, single fiber electromyography (SFEMG) is considered to be the most sensitive test for evaluating all categories of MG, being abnormal in 92 to 100% of MG cases. Only one study exists concerning SFEMG in dogs, in which a pelvic limb muscle was studied. In MG, different muscles are involved to different degrees and focal forms also exist. The capability to perform SFEMG in several different muscle groups should increase our ability to diagnose MG in dogs. The purpose the present study was to develop a technique for jitter in a facial muscle and a muscle of the thoracic limb. This study will provide baseline information of jitter for use in the diagnosis of MG in dogs.",

Lymphohematopoietic malignancies are common spontaneous diseases of dogs whose clinical presentation and biological behavior closely resemble their human counterparts. The goal of this study was to define the potential to use canine lymphoma and leukemia as suitable models to refine therapeutic approaches targeting the interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor. We evaluated the patterns of interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R) expression in thirteen dogs with multicentric non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) and in six dogs with leukemia (ALL n \u03ed 3, CLL in blast crisis, n \u03ed 1, AMoL n \u03ed 2). We first cloned and sequenced the complete coding domains of the wild type canine IL-2R\u2423 chain gene. We next used qualitative RT-PCR to examine expression of the IL-2R \u2423, \u2424, and \u2425 c subunits in the tumors. Messenger RNA for the IL-2R \u2423, \u2424, and \u2425 c subunits that comprise the high affinity receptor were present in samples from all dogs with NHL. Expression of functional surface IL-2R also was demonstrated flow cytometrically in NHL cells from four of four dogs tested. Leukemic cells from one dog with B cell ALL and two dogs with AMoL expressed mRNA for all three subunits, whereas cells from another dog with B cell leukemia and both dogs with T cell ALL expressed only mRNA for the \u2424 and \u2425 c subunits that comprise the intermediate affinity receptor. These results indicate that the IL-2R is commonly expressed in canine lymphohematopoietic malignancies and support the suitability of this large animal model to evaluate targeted IL-2R cancer therapy using approaches of interest in the treatment of humans with hemolymphatic cancers. 82 GENETICALLY MODIFIED SALMONELLA FOR CANINE CANCER: A PHASE I STUDY.

With painting probes it is possible to directly visualize and identify chromosomal aberrations such as translocations, insertions, amplifications, and deletions more rapidly and reliably than with traditional cytogenetic techniques.

These advancements are particularly important for the study of the complex karyotypic rearrangements found in solid tumors. Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) is a state-of-the-art technique for detecting numerical chromosome changes, such as amplifications, deletions, aneuploidy, and unbalanced translocations in tumors. CGH involves the simultaneous hybridization of tumor and normal DNA, labeled with 2 different fluorochromes, onto a normal metaphase chromosome spread. Computer image analysis allows for detection of differences in the fluorescent intensity of the two fluorochromes indicating gains or losses in the tumor at particular chromosomal loci.",

The high mortality rate is associated with the proliferation of gram negative bacteria, resulting in endotoxemia. Activation of leukocytes by endotoxin initiates an inflammatory cascade, which may culminate in cardiovascular collapse and death. Although antimicrobials are essential for the treatment of septicemia, bactericidal therapy itself may cause endotoxin release. The purpose of this study was to determine which antimicrobials used to treat E. coli septicemia minimize endotoxin release and subsequent inflammatory mediator activity while maintaining bactericidal efficacy.",

If this model accurately mimics exercise-induced pulmonary hemorrhage (EIPH), there are obvious indications for resting horses that have suffered an episode of pulmonary hemorrhage. Compliance differences between collapsed and normal regions of lung could produce shear forces during the forced ventilation of exercise, which may lead to further tissue trauma and hemorrhage. The development of pulmonary fibrosis means full restoration of normal pulmonary mechanical properties is unlikely and this may play a role in the recurrent and progressive nature of EIPH seen in aging performance horses. Intramammary (IMM) infusion of hypertonic saline solution (HSS) has been used to treat clinical mastitis in dairy cows, with little data to support its efficacy or safety. Theoretically, IMM infusion of HSS should induce an osmoticallydriven flow of fluid into the mammary gland, thereby facilitating removal of bacteria, endotoxin, and other inflammatory mediators during stripping. The objective of this study was to determine the safety and efficacy of IMM HSS infusion in cows with experimentally induced coliform mastitis.",

IMM pressure rose from a mean of 1 cm H 2 O to 55 cm H 2 O immediately after HSS infusion, but then stayed constant until stripping 15 minutes later. IMM pressure remained stable over the 3 time points in control glands. Mean volumes stripped from HSS treated glands were 1,284 (range 500-2,000) and 1,204 (575-1,575) ml after the first and second infusions, compared with 105 (40-150) and 68 (15-110) ml for control glands. After 5 of the 12 treatments with IMM HSS, the volume stripped was less than the 1 L of HSS infused. Osmolality and Na and Cl concentrations of secretions stripped from treated glands were significantly (P\u03fd0.05) higher than for control glands. More importantly, serum osmolality and Na and Cl concentrations in the subcutaneous abdominal (milk) veins draining HSS infused glands were increased 15 minutes after infusion, without a concurrent increase in serum albumin or urea nitrogen concentration, indicating movement of infused HSS from treated glands into the blood stream. In conclusion, IMM infusion of HSS did not induce the expected translocation of fluid into mastitic mammary glands or improve the clinical outcome in cows with coliform mastitis. Because some of the HSS was absorbed, the potential exists for concurrent absorption of bacteria, endotoxin, and other inflammatory mediators with IMM HSS treatment. We have previously shown that the excessive airway mucus accumulations in equine recurrent airway obstruction (RAO) can only partly be explained by decreased mucus clearability. Up-regulation of specific mucin genes, however, is a primary mechanism of mucin hypersecretion-and resulting mucus accumulation-in other species. No mucin genes have been identified in the horse to date. Our goal was to identify mucin gene(s) expressed in equine airways and investigate mRNA levels in RAO-affected horses and healthy controls. Specific primers were developed for nucleotide sequences coding for two octapeptide domains that are conserved between the human and rat MUC 5 and MUC 2 genes. RT-PCR amplification of total RNA isolated from horse airways, stomach, and colon yielded cDNA (double-stranded complementary DNA) of 500-600 bp. This is in agreement with the size of cDNA fragments of humans and rats. These PCR products were cloned in E.coli and the sequences of the equine homologues of MUC 5AC and MUC 2 were determined. Based on these sequences primers specific for MUC 5AC and for MUC 2 were designed. Semiquantitative RT-PCR on airways (generations 1, 5 10, 15; v. small airways and parenchyma) stomach, and colon revealed that MUC 5AC is expressed in equine stomach and in all airway generations. MUC 5AC mRNA levels were also compared to the levels of ZO-1, a tight junction gene representative of the amount of epithelial cells in a tissue sample. MUC5AC/ZO-1 mRNA ratios were higher in RAO-affected (pooled samples from 5 individuals) vs. control horses (pooled samples from 7 individuals) at all airway generations. MUC 2 mRNA levels were detected in colon and very faintly in stomach, but not in airway tissue. We conclude that MUC 5AC but not MUC 2 is expressed in horse airways. MUC 5AC up-regulation may be a primary mechanism responsible for mucus hypersecretion in RAO. The pharmacokinetics of azithromycin (Zithromax ) were investigated in six, healthy, 2 to 4 month old foals. Azithromycin was administered to each foal at a dose of 10 mg/kg by both the intravenous (IV) and the intragastric (IG) route using a cross-over design. After the first IG dose, 4 additional doses were administered at 24-hour intervals. During the study, the foals were housed in individual stalls with their dam and had free access to hay and water. A microbiological assay was used to measure azithromycin concentrations in serum, peritoneal fluid, synovial fluid, pulmonary epithelial lining fluid (PELF), and bronchoalveolar cells.",

            "text": "Based on the pharmacokinetic parameters, MIC of Rhodococcus equi isolates, and drug concentrations in PELF and bronchoalveolar cells, a single daily oral dose of 10 mg/kg would likely be appropriate for the treatment of R. equi infections in foals. Additional studies are required to confirm the efficacy and safety of this dosage in a clinical setting. The properties of azithromycin, a macrolide antimicrobial drug, suggest that it may be an alternative to erythromycin for treatment of Rhodococcus equi pneumonia in foals. To investigate this possibility, the disposition of azithromycin in plasma, polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN), and macrophages was examined after a single dose in foals. Azithromycin suspension was administered orally at a dose of 10 mg/kg body weight to 5 healthy 2-3 month old foals. Two weeks later, azithromycin was administered by intravenous (IV) infusion at a dose of 5 mg/kg to the same foals. Plasma samples were collected prior to and at 15 and 30 minutes and at 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96 , and 120 hours after oral and IV administration. Peripheral blood PMN were collected at 4, 12, 24, 72, and 120 hours after oral administration. Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cells were collected 120 hours after oral administration. Azithromycin concentrations in plasma, PMN, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and cells were determined by reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography with coulometric electrochemical detection (HPLC-EC). There were no adverse effects after either drug administration. Azithromycin oral absorption was variable with a mean systemic availability of 33% (\u03e916.5%). The plasma half-life was 15 and 10 hours after IV and oral administration, respectively. As in other species, azithromycin had a very large volume of distribution (VD) of 11.6 L/kg (VD ss ) and 12.4 (VD area ), respectively. The large VD can be attributed to high tissue and intracellular concentrations, which was exhibited by the high concentration of azithromycin in PMN. The maximum concentration (C max ) in PMN was 27.3 g/ml, but only 0.72 g/ml in plasma after oral administration. At 12 hours after drug administration, the concentrations in PMN were greater than 200 times the plasma concentrations. In addition, azithromycin concentrations in PMN persisted for 120 hours after administration (half-life in PMN \u03ed 68 hours), even though they were detectable in plasma for only 12-24 hours in most foals after oral administration. Concentrations also were determined in bronchoalveolar cells, but drug was not detected in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid. These pharmacokinetic studies show that despite low plasma concentrations, azithromycin is moderately absorbed orally, is extensively distributed, and persists in high concentrations in leukocytes. These properties indicate that azithromycin is potentially an effective treatment for Rhodococcus equi pneumonia in foals. S-adenosyl methionine (SAMe) is a natural product that has membrane stabilizing and antioxidant actions. Preliminary studies have shown that SAMe can protect against bile-induced apoptosis in hepatocytes. The ability of SAMe to protect other epithelial cells from chemically induced apoptosis is not known. SAMe may not be transported into other epithelial cells or it may not undergo the same metabolic conversion as seen in hepatocytes. The aim of this study was to determine if SAMe has a protective effect on bile acid induced apoptosis in primary cultures of rat hepatocytes and MDCK-Ntcp cells, a canine renal tubule cell line that overexpresses the bile acid transporter. Primary cultures of rat hepatocytes and MDCK-Ntcp cells were grown on cover slips covered with rattail collagen and maintained in Minimal Eagles Media. The cells were pretreated with SAMe for 2 hrs. MDCK-Ntcp cells were also pretreated overnight with SAMe. Apoptosis was induced with 50M glycochenodeoxycholate (GCDC). After 2 hrs, cells were fixed and stained with the nuclear fluorochrome Hoescht 33258. Under fluorescence microscopy, 500 cells were counted and the number of cells with apoptotic morphology was recorded. The results were expressed as % apoptosis. GCDC induced apoptosis in MDCK-Ntcp cells (22.9% \u03ee 5.6%) and in primary rat hepatocytes (18.8% \u03ee 3.4%) Pretreatment with SAMe for 2 hrs at 50M or 500M had no effect on GCDC induced apoptosis in MDCK-Ntcp cells (101.4% \u03ee 17.8% and 90.0% \u03ee 12.8% of GCDC induced apoptosis, respectively). Pre-incubation of MDCK-Ntcp cells with 500 uM SAMe for 16 hrs had a modest, but significant, protective effect against GCDC induced apoptosis (75.8% \u03ee 9.8% of GCDC induced apoptosis) while 16 hr pre-treatment with 50 uM was without effect. In primary rat hepatocytes, 2 hr pre-treatment with 50 uM or 500 uM SAMe resulted in a significant reduction in GCDC induced apoptosis (77.7% \u03ee 4.6% and 60.5 % \u03ee 6.5% of GCDC induced apoptosis, respectively). SAMe has a modest protective effect against GCDC induced apoptosis in primary rat hepatocytes and MDCK-Ntcp cells. This cytoprotective effect is greater in rat hepatocytes.",

The transition metals copper (Cu) and iron (Fe) are thought to contribute to cellular injury in necroinflammatory and cholestatic liver disorders. Liver tissue zinc (Zn) is known to be reduced in humans with portosystemic shunting due to complex factors; this may compromise intermediary metabolism, ammonia detoxification and resistance against oxidant damage. We prospectively measured liver Cu, Fe, and Zn in 117 dogs (wedge or laparoscopic biopsies) using atomic absorption spectroscopy (g/gm dry weight tissue). Median (range) of values for specific disorders, categorization into necroinflammatory (NI) and non-necroinflammatory (NNI) disorders, and significant differences are shown. Highest tissue Cu and Fe were found in NI disorders and on inspection, lowest tissue Zn was found in dogs with congenital portosystemic shunting.

Further investigation is required. CFSE is a fluorescent dye that becomes stably incorporated into cell membranes. Each subsequent cell division results in the serial halving of the fluorescent intensity of the dye which can be quantified using cytofluorometric analysis. We have utilized this technique in combination with other fluorescently labeled cell surface markers to analyze the proliferative capacity (Cp) of feline lymphocyte subsets in response to a polyclonal stimulus. Mononuclear cells were isolated from the peripheral blood of healthy cats, labeled with CFSE and stimulated wirh ConA for 72 hours. Cells were then labeled with anti-CD4 or anti-CD8 markers. Cytofluorometric analysis was used to determine the Cp of lymphocyte subpopulations. The CFSE proliferation profile of CD8\u03e9 cells (selected in the R2 gate of Fig. A) is shown in histogram format in Fig.B . Cells that have undergone the same number of divisions fluoresce with the same intensity and appear within the same peak on the histogram. The number of cells undergoing 0, 1, 2 etc. divisions can be determined and the Cp of that subpopulation can be calculated. This technique has numerous advantages over 3 H-thymidine incorporation: 1) proliferation of specific lymphocyte subpopulations can be determined 2) it is non radioactive 3) small numbers of cells (2 x 10 5 ) can be evaluated 4) vital dyes can be included so that reduced proliferation associated with lymphocyte death in culture can be recognized. This tool can be applied to further our understanding of the pathophysiology of disease and effects of immunosuppressants on proliferation of subpopulations e.g. naive vs. memory cells. Selective immunosuppression of specific subsets will be useful and possible. Zolpidem is a non-benzodiazepine hypnotic of the imidazopyridine class that is used to treat insomnia in humans. Zolpidem binds selectively to the benzodiazepine omega-1-receptor and causes an increased frequency of chloride channel opening resulting in inhibition of neuronal excitation. A retrospective study was conducted of zolpidem ingestion in dogs that were reported to the ASPCA National Animal Poison Control Center between January 1998 to July 2000. Data analysis included amount ingested, the onset and duration of signs, and the clinical effects. Thirty-three cases of zolpidem ingestion in dogs (ranging in age from 5 months to 16 years) were evaluated. Approximate ingested dosages ranged from 0.24 to 21 mg/kg. In eighty-five percent of cases, clinical signs developed within one hour and usually resolved within 12 hours. Incidence of clinical signs reported included ataxia (18 cases; 54.5%), hyperactivity (10 cases; 30.3%), vomiting (7 cases; 21.2 %), depression (5 cases; 15.2%), panting, disorientation, non-specific behavioral changes, and hypersalivation (4 cases each; 12.1%.) Other signs reported included tachycardia, tremors, apprehension, vocalization, hypersalivation, weakness, and hyperesthesia. Although CNS depression is reported as a primary effect of zolpidem in humans and would also be expected in dogs, information obtained from this study revealed that some dogs may exhibit a paradoxical excitation reaction. This effect appears to vary between individual dogs and does not appear to be affected by the animal's age or by dosage. Objective structured clinical examinations (OSCE) have been used in the medical and dental environment for testing clinical skills in various areas. We adapted the OSCE and used it as a component of the final graduating examination in an attempt to produce an examination that would test the clinical skills and clinical knowledge in a fashion that was more objective, reliable, valid and efficient than the previously used oral examination. The second component of the assessment was a written theoretical examination based on case management questions. Thirty-nine final year veterinary students divided into 2 groups were examined on one day. While 20 students passed consecutively through 20 timed OSCE stations of 8 minutes each, the remaining students sat the theoretical examination. After a 40-minute break the groups switched and took the other examination. The 20 OSCE stations were designed to test student skills in history taking, physical examination, data interpretation, problem solving, and technical skills. At the end of each examination the student completed an evaluation questionnaire.",

Insulin is a major anabolic effector in the body, and is also an important regulator of the GH-IGF axis. Studies in diabetic humans revealed that insulin deficiency leads to a decrease in IGF I concentrations, although GH levels tend to be high. After starting insulin therapy IGF I concentrations normalize within 1 to 4 weeks. In diabetic cats IGF I and GH measurements are used for the diagnosis of hypersomatotropisms (HS).

Thyroglobulin antibody (TgAA) has been reported to be a useful serum marker for canine immune mediated thyroiditis. Since the recent availability of a commercial canine TgAA assay, the significance of a positive antibody test result in a dog with no evidence of thyroid dysfunction (normal serum thyroxine (T4) and thyrotropin (TSH)) has been questioned. By following 234 dogs with this combination of test results at 3-month intervals for 12 months we hoped to provide some objective outcome information. The study group included 45 intact females, 82 spayed females, 21 intact males and 86 castrated males. The largest age-group was 2 year-olds. Approximately, 35% of cases were described as healthy and were identified during a screening test. The remainder was initially sampled because of some clinical evidence of disease. One-hundred-and-seventyone dogs (73%) completed the 12-month follow-up period or had laboratory evidence of thyroid dysfunction prior to that time (defined as TSH \u03fe 0.68ng/ mL and/or FreeT4 by equilibrium dialysis (FT4d) \u03fd5 pmol/L). The remaining dogs were lost to follow up (44), withdrawn without laboratory evidence of thyroid dysfunction (15) or died (4). Thirty-three dogs (19.3%) had laboratory evidence of thyroid dysfunction indicated by either both high TSH and low FT4d (7; 4.1%), high TSH (23; 13.4%), or low FT4d (3; 1.8%). Of those 138 which did not develop evidence of thyroid dysfunction, 98 (57.3%) remained TgAA positive, 14 (8.1%) gave an inconclusive TgAA result and 26 (15%) became TgAA negative. When the data were re-coded to include only those 149 dogs with more than one positive TgAA result the outcome at 12 months was: 22% had laboratory evidence of thyroid dysfunction and of the remainder 65.8% were still TgAA positive, 6% had inconclusive TgAA results and 6% became TgAA negative. Dogs under 5 years and those with thyroid hormone cross-reacting antibodies (T3AA, T4AA) had a slightly increased risk of developing thyroid dysfunction (Odds ratio 95pci 1.08-12.71 p \u03ed 0.019; 1.01-5.38 p \u03ed 0.029 respectively).",

Feline hyperthyroidism is a common endocrinopathy in cats that resembles toxic nodular goiter (TNG) in humans. Abnormalities of the TSH receptor-G protein-mediated signal transduction cascade have been shown to be involved in the pathogenesis of human TNG. Previous work from our laboratory has implicated similar pathogenic mechanisms involved in feline hyperthyroidism (Hammer et al., 2000 AJVR 61:874-879) . We demonstrated that adenomatous thyroid tissue from hyperthyroid cats showed significantly decreased expression of inhibitory G proteins (G i ). Three subtypes of G i proteins (G i1 , G i2 , G i3 ) have been identified that have unique signaling activities in different cell types.

Normal thyroids were removed from healthy, aged-matched cats euthanized in other experimental studies. Serum thyroxine and thyroid histology were normal in the control cats. Enriched membrane preparations were made from thyroid tissue snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. The expression of G i , G i1 , G i2 , and G i3 were determined at the protein level in normal and hyperthyroid tissue by western blot analysis using specific anti-peptide antibodies. Relative protein amounts were quantified using densitometry and each was compared to its own control on the same blot. As reported previously adenomatous thyroid tissue showed a significant decrease of 53% (\u03ee 14; p\u03fd0.001; n \u03ed 3) in G i expression as compared to normal thyroid tissue. Correspondingly, G i2 showed significant decrease of 39% (\u03ee10; p\u03fd0.01; n \u03ed 3) in adenomatous thyroid tissue as compared to control.

Cats were excluded from the study if they were in RF prior to treatment, if a urinary tract infection was diagnosed, or if euthyroidism and plasma creatinine concentrations were not adequately documented during a 6 month follow up period. The plasma creatinine concentration at 6 months was used to define 2 groups, cats in RF (creatinine \u03fe1.9 mg/dl) and cats not in RF (NRF). Pre-treatment urine protein:creatinine (UPC) and urine albumin:creatinine (UAC) in these two groups were compared by the Mann-Whitney U test. In summary, many hyperthyroid cats have significant urinary loss of proteins including albumin. The magnitude of proteinuria can not be used to predict which cats will develop RF when euthyroid. Proteinuria resolves following treatment of hyperthyroidism in most cats including many that develop azotemia. Methimazole (Tapazole R ) is the oral antithyroid drug used most commonly in the U.S. to treat cats with hyperthyroidism. Methimazole is usually given twice daily, and has a relatively short plasma half-life in cats. However, because methimazole is actively concentrated in the thyroid gland, its plasma half-life may not reflect its duration of antithyroid activity. Studies in human patients with hyperthyroidism have shown similar remission rates between once daily and more frequent divided daily methimazole dosing regimens. The objective of this study was to determine whether once daily dosing of methimazole is as effective as divided twice daily dosing for the management of hyperthyroidism in cats.",

Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) is a hormone with multiple anti-hypertensive actions. Studies conducted in man and rats have demonstrated that hypertension is associated with a shift of intravascular volume from peripheral to central compartments. The increase in atrial filling pressure that ensues stimulates ANP release from cardiac myocytes. ANP is synthesized as a pro-hormone and is cleaved into ANP(99-126) and proANP(1-98) peptides on release from the myocyte. ProANP(1-98) has a long half-life which facilitates its measurement as the need for sample extraction is obviated and temporal fluctuations in concentration are minimized. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of blood pressure (BP) on plasma proANP(1-98) concentration in normal cats, and cats with chronic renal failure (CRF).",

Idiopathic lower urinary tract disease (ILUTD) is a common cause of hematuria and pollakiuria in cats. Amitriptyline, a tricyclic antidepressant with anticholinergic, antihistaminic, anti-inflammatory, and analgesic properties, has been advocated for symptomatic therapy of ILUTD. However, the efficacy of amitriptyline for treatment of ILUTD has not been evaluated using a randomized clinical trial.

Instances of abnormal health were mild and infrequent with similar distributions for the placebo-and Rimadyl -treated dogs. A study was conducted to evaluate the comparative pharmacokinetics of Rimadyl at steady-state conditions in dogs following oral and subcutaneous administration. Eighteen male beagles were randomized into one of two treatments in a two-sequence, two-period crossover design with a ten-day washout between periods. Twenty-five milligrams of Rimadyl were administered orally or subcutaneously (50 mg/mL solution) every 12 hours for 7 days. Blood samples were collected from dogs within 1 hour prior to treatment and 0.25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, and 12 hours following administration of the first dose of each period and 0. 25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 12, 24, 48, 72 , and 96 hours following administration of the last dose of each period. Plasma concentrations of Rimadyl were determined using a specific, validated, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method with fluorescence detection that was accurate and reproducible in the range of 0.25 to 50 g/mL. Plasma concentration data were transformed and geometric means were calculated for maximum plasma concentration (C max ) following the first dose, area under the concentration-time curve after the first dose (AUC 0\u219212 ), and AUC 0\u2192\u03f1 following administration of the last dose. For each variable, the 90% confidence interval was constructed on the difference between the mean of the injectable formulation and the mean of the oral formulation divided by the mean of the oral formulation. Variables were considered statistically similar if the 90% confidence interval of the mean difference was within \u03ea20% and 25%. The mean C max was 16.9 g/mL following a single oral dose and was 8.0 g/mL following a single subcutaneous injection. The mean AUC 0\u219212 after a single oral dose was 73.1 g\u00b7hr/mL and was 64.3 g\u00b7hr/mL after a single subcutaneous injection. The 90% confidence interval for C max was outside of the bioequivalence criteria (\u03ea56.8 to \u03ea48.7%) whereas the 90% confidence interval for AUC 0\u219212 was within the bioequivalence criteria (\u03ea16.3 to \u03ea7.5%). At steady-state, the mean AUC 0\u2192\u03f1 was 101.9 g\u00b7hr/mL and 111.0 g\u00b7hr/mL following oral and subcutaneous dosing respectively, and the 90% confidence interval was within the bioequivalence criteria (2.3 to 15.9%). The results of this study indicate that peak plasma concentrations following a single dose of Rimadyl differ when administered orally or subcutaneously, but total drug exposure at steady-state is bioequivalent. Azathioprine is a cytotoxic thiopurine drug that is metabolized to 6-mercaptopurine. 6-Mercaptopurine is further converted into active metabolites that exert immunosupressive and cytotoxic effects, or it is metabolized by the enzyme thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT). Human RBC TPMT activity is affected by underlying disease (such as renal failure), and certain drugs (such as diuretics). However, the major factor responsible for individual variation in TPMT activity in humans is a genetic polymorphism. Low and intermediate RBC TPMT activity on a genetic basis have been correlated with azathioprine toxicity in human studies. Conversely, relatively high TPMT activity has been associated with poor remission rates and relapse of disease. Therefore, azathioprine dosage regimens in humans are based on TPMT phenotype.",

Mycophenolate mofetil (CellCept-Roche Pharmaceuticals) is a relatively lymphocyte-specific immunosuppressive drug used primarily in human renal transplant recipients. Prolonged renal allograft survival has also been shown with MMF use (as an adjunct to other drugs) in canine transplant studies. The active metabolite, mycophenolate (MPA), interferes with the de novo pathway of GTP synthesis (required by lymphocytes) via inhibition of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH). In humans and dogs, mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) is rapidly converted to MPA after gastrointestinal absorption. MMF has shown promise as a therapeutic option for several autoimmune disorders in people (e.g. acquired MG, AIHA). The investigators have had encouraging results with MMF treatment of several dogs with severe autoimmune disease. CellCept appears to have a rapid onset of action, and few serious side-effects, compared to more conventional immunosuppressive drugs. The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of MMF and its metabolites in normal dogs at an approximate dosage of 20 mg/kg.

A comparative study was conducted in dogs to evaluate the effect of subcutaneous injection volume on the disposition of Rimadyl . Eighteen male beagles were randomized into one of two treatments in a two-sequence, two-period crossover design with a ten-day washout between periods. Rimadyl (50 mg/mL solution) was administered as a single subcutaneous injection at a dosage of 2 mg/ lb (0.04 mL/lb) in one subcutaneous site or divided equally between two separate subcutaneous sites. Blood samples were collected from dogs within one hour prior to treatment and at 0. 25, 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 12, 24 , and 48 hours after administration of Rimadyl within each period. Plasma concentrations of Rimadyl were determined using a specific, validated, high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method with fluorescence detection that was accurate and reproducible in the range of 0.25 to 50 g/mL. Plasma concentration data were transformed to natural logarithms and geometric means were calculated for maximum plasma concentration (C max ) and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC 0-last and AUC 0-infinity ). For each variable, the 90% confidence interval was constructed on the difference between the mean of the two-site administration and the one-site administration divided by the mean of the one-site administration. Variables were considered statistically similar if the 90% confidence interval of the mean difference was within \u03ea20% and 25%. The mean C max was 12.4 g/mL following a one-site subcutaneous injection and 13.4 g/mL following a two-site subcutaneous injection. The mean AUC 0-last was 172.0 g hr/mL and 155.9 g hr/mL following a one-site and two-site subcutaneous injection, respectively and the mean AUC 0-infinity was 180.1 g hr/mL and 163.3 g hr/mL after a one-site and two-site subcutaneous injection, respectively. C max was statistically similar between one-and two-site subcutaneous injections (\u03ea3.7% to 21.4%). AUC 0-last and AUC 0-infinity fell slightly outside the lower boundary of the confidence interval (-21.0% and \u03ea20.1%, respectively), but were essentially equivalent.",

Skim milk from hyperimmunized cows expresses anti-inflammatory activity and exhibits beneficial effects in humans with rheumatoid arthritis. However, intact milk consists of approximately 50% lactose by weight, making it unsuitable for therapeutic use in adults of some common species of domestic animals.

Endothelin-1 is a potent vasoconstrictor peptide that has potential value as prognostic and diagnostic aid in various forms of cardiovascular disease. Our laboratory is investigating the role played by Endothelin-1 in heart disease in cats and searching for potential interspecies crossreactivity of antibodies to these peptides. In this study, we report on the comparative sequence of feline Endothelin-1 (ET-1) and its precursor, big Endothelin-1 (big ET-1). Total RNA was extracted from feline heart tissue to make complementary DNA (cDNA) by reverse transcription using oligo-T primers. Consensus ET-1 gene sequences of known species were identified and used as primers (5'TGCTGTTTGTGGCTTTCCAAGG3'and 5'GGCAAAAATTCCAGCACTTCTTG 3') in PCR reaction to amplify a portion of cat ET-1. A cDNA product of approximately the predicted length was obtained (about 320 bp) and subsequently sequenced. The final nucleotide sequence of feline ET-1 and big ET-1 were verified using different primers and sample sources, including genomic DNA (gDNA) from blood. The final sequence was submitted to Genbank (AF320770).",

The putative physiologically active portion of feline ET-1 is 21 amino acids long (CSCSSLLDKECVYF-CHLDIIW) and arises from a single exon. Although the ET-1 amino acid sequence is identical among several mammalian species (mouse, guinea pig, rat, human, cow, dog and pig) the cat ET-1 sequence differs at position seven, where it has a leucine residue rather than methionine.

However, dogs with DKA do not have serum insulin concentration that is significantly decreased compared to dogs with DM or KDM. This study tested commercially available protease inhibitors to prevent changes in free T4 by dialysis (FT4D) and degradation of Parathormone (PTH) in serum exposed to shipment conditions. Twelve protease inhibitors were evaluated at the manufacturer's recommended concentration. Serum was incubated at 37C for 5 days, the most extreme condition likely to be encountered during shipment. A sub-sample was removed and frozen every 24 hours (H) to determine by immunoassay the amount of FT4D (pmol/L) and PTH (pmol/L) remaining. Control samples of FT4D increased over 500% at 5 days. While this increase was not completely prevented by any of the protease inhibitors, AEBSF and Pefabloc SC had the lowest increases (\u03fd200%). Control samples of PTH decreased to 34% remaining after 24H. Aprotinin, AEBSF (4-(2-AminoEthyl)-Benzene Sulfonyl Fluoride), Pefabloc SC (AEBSF 10X), Complete Mini Tabs-EDTA free, and Leupeptin limited degradation of PTH (\u03fe60% remaining after 24H). These five inhibitors were then tested with PTH samples at the recommended concentration at 21C and at five times the recommended concentration at 37C and 21C for 48H each, with a sub-sample removed every 24H. Control samples of PTH at 21C had only 37% of the PTH remaining after 48H. Results indicated that the five inhibitors were better able to prevent degradation of PTH at 21C than at 37C and at five times recommended concentration than at recommended concentration. At 21C incubation, 62-88% of PTH remained at 2 days in samples with protease inhibitor. At 5x recommended concentration, stability improved with 78-\u03fe100% PTH remaining. Pefabloc SC and AEBSF most effectively prevented degradation, with \u03fe100% of the original PTH remaining after 48H at 21C, suggesting that these protease inhibitors may be the best choice for use during shipment of serum samples for PTH analysis.

Alpha 1 -proteinase inhibitor (\u2423 1 -PI) is a plasma protein that binds reversibly to trypsin (T) during pancreatitis. Studies in human patients suggest that measurement of \u2423 1 -PI complexed with T (\u2423 1 -PI/T) in serum may be a useful tool for the diagnosis and prognosis of pancreatitis. Human beings with severe pancreatitis and rodents with experimentally induced pancreatitis have significantly higher serum concentrations of \u2423 1 -PI/T than subjects with mild disease. The objective of this study was to develop and validate an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for the measurement of \u2423 1 -PI complexed with canine cationic trypsin (cCT) in canine serum.",

The similar ELISA values in cats infected with a variety of Helicobacter spp. suggests substantial antigenic homology between different Helicobacter spp., and the higher degree of inflammation in infected than uninfected cats, supports a role for Helicobacter as a cause of gastritis in cats. Fifteen per cent of the dog population produce intermittent loose faeces that respond to dietary change, this mild condition is referred to as non-specific dietary sensitivity (NSDS). Disruption and inflammation of the intestinal epithelial barrier have been demonstrated in NSDS, but it is not known how this could influence systemic health in these dogs. This study was undertaken to determine whether disruption of the intestinal barrier in dogs with NSDS is associated with changes in systemic blood parameters. A group of 12 NSDS dogs and 10 control dogs of various breeds and of mixed age and sex were compared. Routine haematology and standard biochemical parameters were determined. White blood cell (WBC) populations were analysed using flow cytometry (FACScalibur, Becton Dickinson) using directly conjugated anti-canine antibodies (Serotec). Creactive protein (CRP) and haptoglobin analysis were performed using available assays (Biognosis). Serum Ig levels were analysed by canine specific ELISA (Bethyl). Results were analysed using students T-test with statistical significance assumed at P\u03fd0.05. Dogs with NSDS were found to have significantly reduced WBC counts (control 9.9\u03ee3.9x10 9 /l, NSDS 5.8\u03ee0.8x10 9 /l) due to declines in neutrophil and T cell populations. Analysis highlighted changes in plasma biochemistry, including increased liver enzyme levels (ALT-control 24.5\u03ee8.4U/l, NSDS 46.1\u03ee12.8U/l). Serum IgG levels were found to be increased (control 14.6\u03ee3.9mg/ml, NSDS 29.6\u03ee3.1mg/ml) and serum IgA reduced (control 2.6\u03ee1.9mg/ml, NSDS 1.2\u03ee0.8mg/ml) in the NSDS dogs. Reduced haptoglobin (control 1.49\u03ee0.60mg/ml, NSDS 0.19\u03ee0.02mg/ml) suggested NSDS RBC may have increased susceptibility to haemolysis. No difference in CRP levels was noted. These findings suggest that NSDS dogs show changes in blood parameters in addition to the intestinal abnormalities already characterised. Further studies are required to understand the importance of these findings in relation to NSDS. This is to report 8 cases of chronic severe dyschezia, caused by localized anal mucosal lupus erythematosus, with in most cases only very discrete abnormalities on physical examination. Each case was presented with a prolonged history of severe dyschezia, manifested by fear and vocalization on defecation. Signs had been present for 2 months to more than a year. A diagnosis had not been made in any case, and various treatments had been tried, such as antibiotics, NSAIDs, or sulfasalazine, without any effect.",

Maximal responses were attained at 6.5 x 10 \u03ea4 M erythromycin stearate and 7.3 x 10 \u03ea4 erythromycin ethyl succinate concentrations. Maximal erythromycin stearate and erythromycin ethyl succinate responses were 72 and 59% respectively of the maximal ACh response (10 \u03ea4 M) in ascending or descending canine longitudinal smooth muscle. Erythromycin-induced contractile responses were inhibited 45-50% by atropine (1 M). Nifedipine (1 M) totally inhibited the erythromycin responses. Erythromycin was without effect on circular smooth muscle in the canine colon. Erythromycin also had no effect on longitudinal or circular feline colonic smooth muscle. We conclude that: (1) erythromycin stimulates longitudinal smooth muscle contractions in the canine colon (2) erythromycin-induced contractions in the canine colon are partially cholinergic-dependent and involve influx of extracellular calcium and (3) erythromycin has no effect on feline colonic smooth muscle. Intestinal permeability and mucosal function testing is a noninvasive and sensitive method for evaluating intestinal integrity and function. Testing consists of oral administration of a sugar solution and determination of the percent urinary recovery of the sugars administered. Lactulose and rhamnose are markers of intestinal barrier function. Methylglucose and xylose are markers of intestinal absorptive capacity. Sucrose is a marker of gastric barrier function. The goal of this project was to describe the kinetics of the urinary recovery of these 5 sugars after oral administration in healthy cats.",

Thus, the natural history of this organism in the feline host and any relationship to bovine and swine trichomonosis needs further evaluation. In light of the intimate association between infected cats and their human companions, investigation of this organism's zoonotic potential may warrant attention. Leptospirosis is a ubiquitous disease that affects many mammalian species. Prior to the introduction of a bivalent canine leptospiral vaccine in the 1960s, serovars icterohaemorrhagiae and canicola were most commonly associated with clinical disease in dogs. Over the past twenty years there appears to have been a shift in the epidemiology of canine leptospirosis, with more clinical cases caused by non-vaccine serovars. The purpose of this study was to prospectively 1) determine the seroprevalence of leptospiral antibodies in asymptomatic dogs, 2) determine whether the epidemiology of canine leptospirosis has changed, and 3) identify risk factors associated with positive leptospiral titers in dogs in Michigan.",

Pythiosis (caused by the aquatic Oomycete Pythium insidiosum) is a devastating disease of dogs, cats, and horses in the southeastern US. Because the clinical and histologic characteristics of pythiosis are similar to those associated with infections caused by Lagenidium sp and Conidiobolus sp, these diseases are difficult to distinguish from one another. Unfortunately, both isolation and accurate morphologic identification of P. insidiosum are difficult; therefore, a definitive diagnosis of pythiosis is rarely made. The goal of this study was to develop and evaluate a polyclonal antibody for the immunohistochemical identification of P. insidiosum hyphae in canine tissues.",

We prospectively compared serum, leukocytes, CSF, and urine for diagnosing distemper encephalitis by RT-PCR in dogs. Poorly vaccinated dogs with progressive multifocal central nervous system disease from our Hospital population were selected for the study. Twenty dogs fulfilled the criteria for inclusion. Eleven of them, including 7 with myoclonus, were diagnosed as having distemper. Distemper encephalitis was confirmed based on a positive RT-PCR in the CSF. When CSF was not available, distemper was diagnosed whenever RT-PCR was positive in serum, leukocytes, and urine. One dog was negative in the CSF, but positive in all other samples. This dog was considered to have distemper. One dog was positive only in the urine and considered negative. The remaining negative dogs were negative in all materials tested. The RT-PCR amplified a fragment from the N gene of the nucleic acid of canine distemper virus (CDV). RNA was extracted using guanidinium thiocyanate. The thermocycle profile consisted of 40 cycles 94 C for 1 minute, 59.5 C for two minutes, and 72 C for 1 minute. The resulting fragment had 287 base pairs.

The dog considered positive despite the negative RT-PCR in CSF had viral fragment amplified in serum, leukocytes, and urine. Four dogs were positive only in CSF and urine. All distemper dogs had positive results in the urine, but only 7 were positive in leucocytes and serum. In conclusion, serum and leukocytes do not appear to be very sensitive for diagnosing naturally-occurring distemper encephalitis in dogs. Urine was the only fluid found positive in all dogs, suggesting its usefulness as a routine screen for dogs in which infection by CDV is a potential differential for the CNS signs. These results also suggest that elimination of the virus in the urine may play an important role in cross-contamination and maintenance of the virus in the environment.

Dipstick urinalyses were performed on all samples; clinician discretion determined method of urine collection and performance of urine sediment examination and/or urine culture. Feline lower urinary tract disease (Feline LUTD) or so called FUS characterized by hematuria, dysuria, pollakiuria, and/or urethral obstruction, has been a common veterinary problem. In 1999, lower urinary tract signs were cited as one of the 25 most common problems reported in cats examined at private veterinary practices in the United States. In Thailand, the same trend was also observed. For one and a half year period, we have included 140 cats into our study. Seventy cats with feline LUTD were selected as cases that were followed prospectively. We also have collected data from seventy vaccinated cats as our control cats. The preliminary results of our one year prospective study of 70 cats with Feline LUTD at Chulalongkorn University Veterinary Teaching Hospital (CUVTH) indicated that the proportional morbidity ratio of Feline LUTD in Thai cats was 2.22 %. Most cats with Feline LUTD in our study were mixed breed (81.4%). The mean age was 54.75 \u03ee 45.04 months old. The affected cats were intact male (41.4%) , neutered male (30.0%), intact female (17.1%), and neutered female (11.4%). The mean weight for cats with feline LUTD was 4.09 \u03ee 1.10 kilograms. Commercial cat food was consumed by 74.3% of the affected cats. Urine culture was performed in 42 cats and indicated the urinary tract infection with Pseudomonas aeruginosa (20.0%), E.coli (60%), and mixed infection (20%). Uroliths were observed in 16 cats but was retrieved only in 4 cats and submitted for analysis. The quantitative analysis of the uroliths revealed that they were composed of Magnesium Ammonium Phosphate (struvite)(100%). Urethral Plug were also found in 8 cats. From our prospective study with 70 cats with FLUTD, the causes of feline LUTD were idiopathic (27.1%), calculi (22.9%), urinary tract infection (14.3%), urethral plug (11.4%), anatomical disorders (2.9%), and trauma (2.9%). Idiopathic lower urinary tract disease (ILUTD) is a common cause of hematuria, and pollakiuria in cats. Urethral obstruction is a potential sequelae of IL-UTD. Previous observations of calicivirus-like particles in a large number of urethral plugs obtained from cats with obstructive ILUTD has led us to hypothesize that feline calicivirus (FCV) may have a role in this disease. In 1998 we isolated a FCV (designated FCV-U1) from a cat with nonobstructive ILUTD. Genetic analysis revealed that FCV-U1was distinct from other FCV strains. We subsequently isolated another FCV (designated FCV-U2) from urine obtained from cat with obstructive ILUTD. It is unknown whether FCV-U2 is a uropathogen or represents innocuous shedding of a respiratory or vaccine strain. Since regions of the capsid protein are unique for each strain, the purpose of this study was to sequence the capsid protein gene of FCV-U2 and compare its nucleotide and amino acid sequences to those of F9 (vaccine), FCV-U1, and other known strains of FCV.",

Two adenoviral vectors were constructed: AdCMV-betagal, which contains the E. coli Lac-Z gene with a nuclear localisation signal under the control of the cytomegalovirus (CMV) immediate-early gene promoter, and a control adenovirus vector (AdRSV-gD), which carries the pseudorabies virus glycoprotein gD gene under the control of the Rous sarcoma virus long terminal repeat promoter. The two kidneys of each dog were injected similarly, either with AdCMV-betagal (10 9 p.f.u./kidney), AdRSV-gD (10 9 p.f.u./kidney) or a Phosphate Buffered Saline solution via one of the three intra-renal routes. Renal function was assessed before and 4 days after surgery. Animals were then euthanatized for pathological examination. Renal samples were also monitored for the presence of nuclear beta-galactosidase-expressing cells.",

No histological lesion was detected in any of the hematoxylin-eosin stained kidney sections, and there was no evidence of ischaemia-reperfusion injury in the kidneys subjected to venous clamping. The IAC injection of AdCMV-betagal resulted in a strong expression of the reporter gene in the cortex, located mainly in the interstitial cells, and in some endothelial cells, while the IU injection of AdCMVbetagal showed beta-gal activity in the pyelic epithelial cells and the distal tubular epithelial cells in the outer stripe of the cortex.",

The position of the pituitary gland was correlated with the hamular processes of the pterygoid bones, which are used as surgical landmarks. For the surgery, the dogs were placed in dorsal recumbency and a right paramedian incision made to expose the confluence of the digastricus and myohyoideus muscles. A dissection plane between the digastricus and myohyoideus muscles was developed to expose the medial surface of the palatine tonsillar fold. An incision was made into the tonsillar fold. The resulting orifice allowed access to the pharynx. The tongue was retracted and a 3-cm incision made in the soft palate. A pneumatic drill and burr was used to create a 4 X 4-cm partial-thickness defect on the midline of the sphenoid bone. The remaining inner cortical portion of the sphenoid bone was removed with a 1-mm up-biting rongeur exposing the dura mater underlying the hypophysis. A cruciate incision was made in the dura mater and the hypophysis was extirpated to the level of the diaphragma sellae using an ultrasonic aspirator. The defect in the sphenoid bone was packed with gelfoam and the soft tissues were closed in routine fashion. The animals were maintained on L-thyroxine (0.1mcg/10# PO bid) and prednisone (0.25 mg/kg PO sid) for the duration of the study. Desmopressin was given for 7 days (1 drop in conjunctiva sid). Endocrinologic testing was performed to assess the pre-and post-surgical status of the anterior pituitary and intermediate lobe. A modified combined anterior pituitary function test was used. Sequential 30-second administrations of thyrotropin-releasing hormone (10 ug/kg IV), corticotropin-releasing hormone (1 ug/kg IV) and gonadotropin-releasing hormone (10 ug/kg IV) were given. Blood samples were collected at 0, 5, 10, 20, 30, and 45 minutes and assayed for ACTH, thyroidstimulating hormone (TSH), cortisol and thyroid hormone (T4). Haloperidol (1.0 mg/kg IV) was administered and the hormone alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (alpha-MSH) quantitated at 0 and 15 minutes. These tests were performed before surgery, 2 and 10 weeks after surgery. Immunohistochemical analysis of the hypothalamus and sella turcica was performed using labeled antibodies (ACTH, alpha-MSH and TSH) to identify the remaining cells.",

Within the population of dogs with IE, there is a group of animals that develop status epilepticus (SE). SE refers to repeated seizure activity with which there is no intermission. Untreated seizure activity can lead to irreversible neuronal injury in addition to systemic complications and as such is considered a medical emergency. It is not known why certain individuals with seizure disorders develop SE; however, pathophysiological studies suggest that recurrent uncontrolled seizures on their own can predispose to future episodes of SE and poor long-term seizure control. Currently, little information is available on the population of dogs with IE that have episodes of SE during the course of their disease. The purpose of this retrospective study is to identify risk factors that predict the occurrence of SE among dogs diagnosed with IE and determine the influence of SE on long-term outcome and survival of epileptic dogs.",

The following variables were also calculated on the basis of the formula of the ''ellipsoid by area'': LV volume at end diastole (LVVED) and end systole (LVVES), stroke volume (SV), ejection fraction (EF), cardiac output (CO); finally, dividing LVVED and SV by the body weight the diastolic index (DI) and stroke index (SI) were calculated.

The beta 2 sympathomimetic agent, clenbuterol is a potent repartitioning agent that has been used to promote growth in cattle and sheep by increasing protein accretion and fat removal with little or no change in total body weight. In the horse, clenbuterol is typically administered in much lower doses (mcg/kg) than other species to achieve bronchodilatory effects. Clinical improvement has been shown in horses with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), bronchitis and pneumonia, however, previous studies have only assessed short term dosing of no more than five days. In fact, the only chronic administration study performed in the horse evaluated clinical signs of COPD after 30 days of clenbuterol administration without assessment of cardiac function. Chronic administration of pharmacological levels of beta 2-agonists have been shown to have toxic effects on the heart; however, no data exist on cardiac function in the horse after chronic clenbuterol administration.

The horses were exercised at a speed of 9 miles/hr (brisk trot) for 30 min (4.5 miles) over a mildly hilly course. The ambient temperatures and relative humidity were 32-34 o C (90-93 o F) and 30%, respectively.",

            "text": "The results of this study demonstrate that exposure to endophyte-infected fescue pasture has an adverse effect on recovery following exercise during hot weather in horses. These findings may have significant implications for exercise and post-exercise recovery in horses, especially those performing in competitions such as endurance racing and eventing, where heart rate recovery and other parameters are used to determine whether the horse is fit to continue. To investigate fluid shifts during dehydration and rehydration with a noninvasive, commercially available device measuring bioelectrical impedance (Equistat 2005), 4 horses were studied during a 48 hr period of dehydration (induced by furosemide administration [0.5 mg/kg IM, q 6 h over the initial 24 h] and withholding of feed and water [entire 48 h]) and a subsequent 36 h rehydration period (providing horses free access to hay and water). Body weight, (BW) bioelectrical impedance (BI) at 5 and 200 Hz, plasma osmolality (Posm), protein concentration (TP), and [Na \u03e9 ] were measured every 12 h as well as 30 min after initial access to water. BW decreased by 7.4 \u03ee 0.2% and 10.4 \u03ee 0.2% after 12 and 48 h of dehydration, respectively, and was accompanied by increases in Posm (by 7.3 and 17.4 mOsm/kg), TP (by 1.4 and 2.1 g/dl), and Na \u03e9 (by 2.9 and 3.2 mEq/l). Plasma volume (estimated by changes in TP) decreased by 19.6 \u03ee 2.0% and 25.7 \u03ee 1.6% after 12 and 48 h of dehydration, respectively, suggesting a greater loss of extracellular fluid (ECF, \u03f320%) than intracellular fluid (ICF, \u03f310%). Although BI predicted a mean decrease in total body fluid volume (TFV) of 46.9 l (compared to a mean BW loss of 41.2 kg) over the initial 12 h of dehydration, variability between horses was considerable and changes in estimates of ECF and ICF, as percentages of TFV, were not detected. Further, despite persisting BW loss, estimated TFV returned to near pre-dehydration values after 36 and 48 h of the dehydration period. When water was provided, horses drank 18.6 \u03ee 2.4 l during the initial 30 min of the rehydration period. Despite rapid decreases in Posm (8.4 mOsm/kg), TP (0.2 g/dl), and plasma Na \u03e9 (3.8 mEq/l) with initial drinking, neither an increase in TFV nor ECF expansion was demonstrated via BI. These data indicate that BI measures did not consistently detect expected changes in body fluid volumes and, thus, may have limited value for field assessment of hydration in equine athletes. The factors that regulate blood flow through the normal equine digital vasculature are of importance if we are to understand what predisposes animals to digital ischemia and laminitis. Endogenous vasodilator mediators are elaborated by the endothelium and sensory-motor nerves innervating the vasculature. Substance P (SP) and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), both potent vasodilatory mediators, are contained in nerves that have been detected in the equine digit. The aim of this study was to determine the potency and efficacy of these peptides as vasodilators of equine digital veins (EDVs) and arteries (EDAs) and to examine the effect of the endothelium on these responses.",

All vessels were constricted initially with depolarizing Krebs solution (DKS; 118mM K\u03e9) to evaluate smooth muscle function. Baseline tension was re-established and vessels were then constricted with U44069 (9, 11-dideoxy-9\u2423, 11\u2423-epoxymethano-prostaglandin F2\u2423; 30nM).

SP mediated vasodilatation was totally dependent on the presence of the endothelium. Two phases of the CRC to SP could be discerned with a plateau (or increase in vessel tone) occurring between 3x10 \u03ea8 M and 3x10 \u03ea7 M. EC 50 and E max values were obtained for the first phase and revealed that EDV(e\u03e9) were significantly more sensitive (EC 50 0.38[-0.2-0.95]x10 \u03ea9 M; p \u03ed 0.01) to SP than EDA(e\u03e9) (EC 50 1.29[0.69-1.7]x10 \u03ea9 M). The E max did not differ significantly between the two vessel types. These results indicate that a dysfunctional endothelium may impair the vasodilatory action of SP on EDAs and EDVs. Further studies are needed to fully characterize these endogenous vasodilator systems and their importance in regulating equine digital blood flow. Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have become the cornerstone for therapy of heart failure and hypertension in both human and small animal veterinary cardiology and have similar potential in the horse. The pharmacodynamics of enalapril after a single oral dose in mares was investigated. Enalapril was administered by nasogastric tube at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg body weight to 5 healthy mares. Serum samples were collected prior to and at 15, 30, and 45 minutes and at 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, and 48 hours after drug administration for measurement of ACE activity, potassium concentrations, and enalapril and its active metabolite, enalaprilat, concentrations. In addition, at these same time points, the heart rate and systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial blood pressures (MAP) were measured indirectly by oscillometric technique. Digital venous blood samples were obtained prior to and at 4 hours after drug administration for measurement of blood gases and lactate. Serum creatinine and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) were measured prior to and at 24 hours after drug administration. Two weeks later, enalapril was administered by nasogastric tube at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg body weight to the same 5 mares. To mimic activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, angiotensin I was administered at a dose of 0.5 g/kg, followed by blood pressure and heart rate measurement, prior to and 30 minutes and 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 24 hours after enalapril administration. There was a trend (p \u03ed .0625) towards a decrease in ACE activity at 45 minutes and 1 and 2 hours after enalapril administration, but ACE activity was never suppressed below 84% (SD 11%). There was a trend (p \u03ed .0625) towards a decrease in MAP at 6 and 8 hours after enalapril administration. Serum concentrations of potassium, creatinine, and BUN and digital venous blood gases and lactate levels did not change during the study. In response to angiotensin I administratin, there was a trend (p \u03ed .0625) towards a decrese in the MAP response from 4-24 hours after enalapril administration. Serum concentrations of enalapril and enalaprilat are pending. Single dose enalapril at 0.5 mg/kg did not demonstrate significant pharmacodynamic effects, nor was there subatantial suppression of ACE activity. Chronic dosing studies are needed to determine if enalapril is efficacious under steady-state conditions. Acute laminitis has been associated with overgrowth of bacteria in the caecum. It is hypothesized that the release of trigger factor(s) from the gut may result in digital vasoconstriction. We have recently shown that a number of amines are formed in the equine caecum and the rate of formation increases with fermentation. If released into the circulation, many monoamines may have direct or indirect vasoactive effects, due to their structural similarities with 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT; serotonin) and catecholamines. The aim of the present study was to examine the ability of monoamines shown to be formed in the equine caecum to displace 5-HT from equine platelets and to cause constriction of isolated digital blood vessels.",

Small rises in circulating concentrations could cause the digital vasoconstriction which has been associated with the developmental phase of acute laminitis. In addition, the aromatic amines have vasoconstrictor actions (directly or via an indirect sympathomimetic effect) and so could contribute to digital vasoconstriction in this way. Equine COPD is characterized by recurrent airway obstruction, airway hyperresponsiveness, and chronic airway inflammation. Bronchoconstriction and hyperreactivity have been shown to be associated with the presence of cysteinyl leukotriene (LT) D4 within the equine airways. This pilot study was to determine the effects of oral LT receptor antagonist therapy, at a dosage of approximately 0.11 mg/kg BW s.i.d for a period of 26 days. The efficacy was determined by changes in clinical signs, endoscopy, aterioalveolar pO 2 difference and lung function testing in five clinic-owned horses with moderate to severe COPD.

This report describes clinical and laboratory findings for five sheep with extensive proliferative skin lesions grossly resembling warts on the distal limbs. The 4 Suffolks and 1 Hampshire ranged from 4 months to 3 years of age. In all sheep, the lesions affected the front and rear extremities and in 2 sheep, the lesions were also present around the head. The lesions were painful to the touch and most sheep were reluctant to move. Three of the sheep were from a single farm and had been housed with 30 other sheep that remained unaffected. The other 2 sheep were from different farms, and had been housed closely with unaffected herdmates. Various treatments, including systemic antibiotics, topical antibiotics, and antifungal ointments were administered; however, clinical improvement was not seen in any case. A variety of diagnostic tests were done on the lesions. In each case, histopathologic examination indicated proliferative cutaneous papillomatosis and in 4 cases intranuclear inclusion bodies were seen. Skin scrapings performed on 2 sheep were negative for ectoparasites. Fungal culture was attempted in 3 sheep and no isolates were identified. Bacteriology was done on samples of lesions from 4 sheep and a heavy growth of a Staphylococcus species was isolated from 2 of these animals. Electron microscopic examination of lesions from 3 sheep revealed numerous parapoxvirus particles. Immunohistochemical analysis of biopsy samples from 2 sheep was negative for papillomavirus. All 5 animals were ultimately euthanized. These cases represent an atypical presentation of parapoxvirus infection in sheep (orf, contagious ecthyma, scabby mouth). The infection appears to be minimally contagious, however the lesions do not self-resolve as does typical orf. This appears to be the first report of these lesions in multiple sheep in North America, although similar lesions have been reported in Israel. The inflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF), interleukin-1 beta (IL-1), and interleukin-8 (IL-8), secreted by alveolar macrophages in response to Mannheimia (Pasteurella) haemolytica virulence factors, are suspected to contribute to the pathogenesis of bovine pneumonic pasteurellosis (BPP). These mediators may therefore represent important therapeutic targets that could be pharmacologically modulated for purposes of disease treatment and prevention. The objective of this study was to evaluate the ability of six pharmacological inhibitors of cytokine production to suppress the expression of TNF, IL-1, and IL-8 genes and proteins by bovine alveolar macrophages in vitro. The compounds tested were pentoxifylline (PTX), rolipram (ROL), tetrahydropapaveroline (THP), thalidomide (THA), SB 203580 (SB), and dexamethasone (DEX). Compounds were selected on the basis of their ability to suppress the production of one or more of these cytokines in other experimental systems.",

The pelvic flexure of 7 horses was isolated, perfused with 1.5mM deoxycholate for 30 minutes, then the mucosa was mounted in Ussing chambers. Mucosal barrier function was assessed by monitoring transepithelial electrical resistance (TER) and mucosalto-serosal fluxes of 3 H-mannitol over 4 hours. Deoxycholate induced significant reductions in TER (35\u03ee1.8\u2340.cm 2 ) compared to control tissues (104\u03ee14.7\u2340.cm 2 ; p\u03fd0.05), but TER recovered to levels approximately 70% of control within 4 hours, associated with histologic evidence of epithelial restitution. There was no significant effect of either flunixin or etodolac on mucosal recovery. However, there was a marked and significant reduction in TER in control tissues treated with flunixin compared to those treated with etodolac and untreated tissues (67\u03ee4.8\u2340.cm 2 , 101\u03ee10\u2340.cm 2 , 134\u03ee14.7\u2340.cm 2 respectively; p\u03fd0.05). Similarly, there were significant increases in mucosal-to-serosal fluxes of mannitol in tissues treated with flunixin and etodolac compared to untreated tissues over the 4 hour recovery period. Despite these changes, there was no histologic evidence of damage, suggesting an effect on paracellular pathways. These studies indicate exposure to 1.5mM deoxycholate injured equine colonic mucosa, but mucosal recovery was independent of COX-elaborated prostanoids. However, flunixin caused marked increases in permeability of control colonic mucosa",

As described in other species, no significant production of IFN-g was detected in unstimulated cells. However, following stimulation with ionomycin/PMA the percentage of CD2\u03e9 T lymphocytes producing IFN-g ranged from 13.5% to 45.7%. This variation is similar to that described in humans and other species. The percentage of CD8\u03e9 lymphocytes producing IFN-g was 17.6-31.5%, whereas 18.1-47.2% CD4\u03e9 lymphocytes were positive for IFN-g. Previous work has shown that adult horses efficiently clear R. equi from the lung in association with an influx of CD4\u03e9 and CD8\u03e9 T lymphocytes. Using tricolor fluorescence we examined cells in bronchoalveolar fluid (BALF) for IFN-g production both before and after intrabronchial challenge with virulent R. equi (n \u03ed 2). Prior to challenge with R. equi, approximately 10% of CD2\u03e9,CD4\u03e9 T lymphocytes and 10% of CD2\u03e9,CD8\u03e9 T lymphocytes in BALF produced IFN-g when stimulated with ionomycin/PMA ex vivo. Following challenge, there was a dramatic increase in BALF in the numbers of CD2\u03e9,CD4\u03e9 T lymphocytes that produced IFN-g upon stimulation and a small increase in the numbers of CD2\u03e9,CD8\u03e9 T lymphocytes that produced IFN-g (examined at Days 7 and 14 post challenge). On a percentage basis, approximately 30% of both CD2\u03e9,CD4\u03e9 T lymphocytes and 30% of CD2\u03e9,CD8\u03e9 T lymphocytes in BALF obtained following challenge produced IFN-g when stimulated ex vivo",

Aliquots of urine were frozen (-80\u040aC) within 15 minutes of collection for subsequent UAlb measurement by an antigen capture ELISA. ELISA results were normalized to a urine specific gravity of 1.010.Using the ELISA as the gold standard, the CM strips correctly reported UAlb in 41 of 67 (61%) urine samples tested. UAlb was correctly reported in 23 of 35 (66%) dogs with negligible UAlb (\u03fd30 ug/ml), 8 of 17 (47%) dogs with MA (30-300), and 10 of 15 (67%) dogs with overt albuminuria (\u03fe300). Results obtained by the CM strip and ELISA were in concordance in 19 of 27 (70%) samples obtained by cystocentesis, 2 of 7 (29%) samples obtained by catheterization, and 19 of 32 (59%) free catch samples. Results from the CM strips and ELISA were in concordance in 0 of 2 dogs with bacterial cystitis and 9 of 21 (43%) dogs with hematuria (\u03fe5 RBC/hpf or \u03fe1\u03e9 blood on dipstick).Urine samples from 12 of 13 (92%) dogs tested with the Mi strips read as negligible UAlb (\u03fd20 mg/ml). Concordance between results obtained by the Mi strips and ELISA occurred in only 4 (31%) samples. Further testing with this product was discontinued.Thesepreliminary results suggest that both the CM and Mi test strips lack sufficient concordance with results obtained by ELISA to be reliable screening tests for MA in the dog. With respect to the CM test strips, catheterization, urinary tract infection and hematuria appeared to negatively impact concordance of results obtained by the CM test strip and ELISA. A reliable, semi-quantitative test strip for canine MA needs to be developed. 179 THE POSSIBLE ROLE OF UROLITH-INDUCED FELINE LOW-ER URINARY TRACT DISEASE IN THAILAND: AN ASIAN POINT OF VIEW.
