In addition, a total of nine and two retransplantations were required in patients with PA and MMA, respectively. Single organ liver transplantation was performed more commonly in both PA and MMA (total n = 307, PA n = 193; MMA n = 114), when compared with kidney (PA n = 2; MMA n = 21) or combined liver\u2013kidney transplantation (PA n = 0; MMA n = 32) (retransplantations not included). Median age at transplantation ranged from 0.25 to 42 years in patients with PA and from 0.4 to 28.0 years in patients with MMA. The most typical reason for any type of transplantation in patients with PA and MMA was recurrent metabolic decompensation. Follow-up data to show outcomes by type of transplantation were available for all PA (n = 195; available follow-up range 0\u201322 years) and MMA (n = 167; range 0.04\u201316 years) patients, although specific timings of follow-up were not always provided.",

Infection is reported as a major cause of post-transplant deaths in patients with PA: Kasahara et al. [13] reported that liver transplantation in nine patients with PA resulted in four sepsis-related deaths, equating to a mortality rate of 44%. However, some studies suggest that transplantation appears to be less of a risk in some patients with PA. For example, a recent retrospective analysis of liver transplantation by Shanmugam et al. [24] reported survival in patients with PA to be 100% at a median follow-up of 32 months. It appears that survival following transplantation in patients with PA seems to be improving with greater experience of the procedure. Indeed, the expertise and experience of the surgical team is an important prognostic factor for general paediatric liver transplantation [43\u201346].",

One patient developed a hepatoblastoma at the age of 11 (less than 2 years post-surgery), followed by neurological complications and death. The three other patients remained alive, with two achieving neurological stability. Morioka et al. [17] reported on two patients with MMA who both died after receiving a liver transplantation, equating to a 100% mortality rate; these deaths were caused by metabolic stroke and aspergillosis. One death caused by a metabolic crisis was identified in a patient with MMA following combined liver\u2013kidney transplantation [47].",

In general, liver transplantation is deemed to be a suitable treatment option for patients with PA and those patients with MMA but without renal impairment. In contrast, combined liver\u2013kidney transplantation is considered more suitable in those patients with MMA and renal impairment. In addition, it is important to recognise the indications and contraindications for the use of transplantation in PA/MMA. Traditionally, transplants have been reserved for the most \u2018brittle\u2019 patient, in whom it is difficult to achieve reasonable metabolic control or that their dietary restriction is very severe and still not achieving metabolic control. More recently, there has been a tendency to transplant at an earlier stage, regardless of the level of metabolic control. One reason behind this approach is the increased availability of transplant units. However, to support the optimal outcome of patients with PA/MMA, it is important that these transplant units have relevant and suitable experience in transplanting patients with metabolic disorders rather than patients with organ failure alone.",

Current Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network (SIGN) guidelines for the management of PA and MMA recommend that liver and/or kidney transplantation should be considered in patients with frequent metabolic decompensations where the clinical condition is difficult to stabilise with dietary/pharmacological treatment [1]. A catabolic state or active metabolic decompensation would be a potential contraindication to transplantation; thus clinicians need to carefully consider related risks and benefits prior to surgery.",

[48] note that while transplanted organs (liver and/or kidney) are an enzyme source, they only partially correct the biochemical defect. However, the small amount of enzyme activity gained by kidney transplantation appears sufficient to improve the metabolic balance in patients with MMA [1]. This could explain why metabolic acidosis was more commonly reported after liver transplantation compared with kidney or combined liver\u2013kidney transplantation. In addition, the risk of subsequent episodes of metabolic acidosis following transplantation may be higher in those patients offered a less restricted dietary protein intake, in contrast with those who remain on a protein-restricted diet and/or receive appropriate pharmacotherapy to support metabolic stabilisation.",

A number of factors may influence the occurrence of post-operative mortality and/or complications. For example, high-level expertise of the transplant team and transplant centre has the potential to reduce post-operative mortality and an experienced team would also recognise that patients with PA/MMA undergoing transplantation would need careful and prolonged management following surgery. As such, the transplant team should aim to work closely with the metabolic team to support the optimal peri- and post-operative management of the patient\u2019s primary metabolic disorder, be it PA or MMA. The use of immunosuppressive therapy, along with the management of any associated tolerability issues, also remains important following transplantation. Extra-hepatic risks remain following surgery in patients with PA and MMA, with transplantation simply aiming to provide a milder and more manageable phenotype of the disease. Patients will therefore be required to remain on a protein-restricted diet, albeit a less stringent one. Of note, patients with PA or MMA should avoid prolonged fasting and dextrose infusions following transplantation in order to promote anabolism and prevent metabolic decompensation perioperatively. In addition, regular renal surveillance is also advised post-transplant in the long term.",

However, the optimal management of metabolic status both perioperatively and following transplantation would serve to minimise any further deterioration of these preoperative conditions. In addition, existing cardiac complications in patients with PA have the potential to improve following liver transplantation. It should be noted that liver and/or kidney transplantation does not reverse any neurologic injury that has accumulated prior to surgery. Of note, SIGN guidelines suggest that transplantation should ideally occur prior to any severe neurological deterioration and under stable metabolic conditions [1]. Thus, residual neurologic injury remains a persistent disease complication suggesting that postponing a transplant to a later stage may lead to additional neurologic insults and possibly inferior neurodevelopmental outcomes. However, post-transplant neurological deterioration in organic acidurias has also been reported (e.g. [39, 49]. De novo MMA production in the central nervous system may contribute to neurological dysfunction given that organ transplantation does not affect the concentration of MMA in the cerebrospinal fluid [48].",

Infection, particularly CMV and EBV viremia, was also commonly reported, particularly in liver transplantation patients. Infection was a predominant cause of post-transplantation death, particularly in patients with MMA, and graft rejection/dysfunction leading to death was also reported. The most common reason reported for retransplantation in both patients with PA and MMA was HAT.

The search strategy used for this review identified 70 suitable references comprising both abstracts and full papers, although the available level of patient information, assessed clinical parameters, and clinical outcomes varied between them. All references were cross-checked to avoid any possible duplication of data between abstracts and full papers, although this was limited by the lack of patient information and clinical data provided in some of the abstracts meaning that the total number of transplants performed was actually lower than that reported. A number of these references were pooled studies of metabolic disease wherein only a few patients had PA or MMA. In addition, duration of follow-up varied substantially between studies, with some studies not providing timings of follow-up or complications, and some clinical outcomes of baseline parameters were not reported. For deaths related to transplantation, some references, particularly abstracts, failed to provide full details of the cause of these deaths, which was typically compounded by a lack of specific patient information. Likewise, for complications of transplantation surgery, some studies specifically defined and assessed complications, while others failed to do so, or failed to provide specific patient details, leaving the reader to subjectively interpret any issues related to the transplantation procedure. For this reason, the overall data included in this review should simply be used as a guide to the current issues related to transplantation in patients with PA and MMA.",

Any transplantation procedure also has an associated mortality risk. Thus, all treatment avenues should ideally be exhausted for PA/MMA before selecting transplantation. If liver and/or kidney transplantation remains a viable option, the benefits of this approach must be individually and meticulously weighed against the risk of perioperative complications, including renal and neurological progressive impairment in the post-transplant period.",
