In recent years, AIDS-related deaths among adolescents and youth increased by 50% while they have decreased among all other age groups [7]. In 2018, 510,000 young people between the ages of 10 to 24 years were newly-infected with HIV, 40% of whom were between 10 and 19 years of age [8]. In addition to heterosexual transmission, a generation of children infected with HIV perinatally are now aging into adolescence, adding to the burden of disease in this age group.",

Yet, adolescents and youth have poor adherence to drug regimens for many chronic illnesses [9\u201312]. Adherence to ART is further complicated by HIV-related stigma [13\u201316]. The period of adolescence and youth is characterized as a time of great physiological and psychological growth and development [1, 17], increased desire for independence from parents [18], and increased risk-taking [19], adding another layer of complexity. During this developmental stage, initiation of sexual activity is common and may include early pregnancy [20]. Adolescents and youth also lack financial autonomy, are prone to peer pressure, and lack problem-solving skills [21\u201325]. Further, in resource-limited settings, external factors including poverty, food scarcity, and HIV-related stigma acutely influence ART adherence and HIV outcomes [26\u201333].",

Much of the research on ART adherence among young people has focused on identifying and estimating the prevalence of these barriers [29, 33, 38, 40, 41]. A comprehensive review of the literature between 2003 and 2015 identified 10 studies which evaluated interventions to improve adherence in adolescents in developed countries [42]. Effective interventions included daily interactive text reminders for dosing [43, 44], and computer-driven support programs [45]. However, none of the studies included were conducted in a low- or middle-income country (LMIC) [46], areas where the global HIV epidemic is centered. Further, most of these studies were descriptive reports or pilot studies with small sample sizes and thus had insufficient power to detect meaningful effects.",

For example, the text message intervention was very narrow in scope\u2014no additional counseling was done via text message and the messages were only sent weekly, so did not serve as a daily reminder for taking ART medication.

While community adolescent treatment supporters significantly improved outcomes [57], ART adherence was ascertained through self-report which may be subject to social desirability bias artificially leading to a positive effect. More objective adherence measures such as MEMS, drug levels or VL outcomes could avoid bias. The community-based support worker intervention also showed improved outcomes [56], but assignment to the intervention was not randomized. Patients received the intervention based on availability of support workers in the area, thus unmeasured confounding cannot be ruled out. For example, support workers may have only been available in more developed or easier-to-access locations. Further, as this intervention was evaluated using existing clinical data in a retrospective cohort design, data on the quality and consistency of intervention implementation is lacking, including frequency of home visits, type of support provided, and content of counseling. Lastly, a majority of studies report results just 1-year from implementing the intervention [50\u201352, 54, 56]. Evaluation of an intervention\u2019s effect over a longer period, particularly for new models of HIV care, could provide information on the long-term durability of an intervention on participant outcomes.",

Four of the seven studies in this review only report VL outcomes and not an ART adherence measurement and only one is limited to ART-na\u00efve participants [56].

Other medication-related interventions among adolescents and youth such as weekends off regimens have been shown to be non-inferior [78], and single-tablet regimens have achieved significantly higher VL suppression rates than multi-tablet regimens [79].

Recent studies of interventions to improve ART adherence among this population show inconsistent effects, highlighting the need for additional, innovative approaches which specifically target the needs of adolescents and youth. To date, individually-targeted interventions have not shown significant effects on adherence, but health services interventions which enhance clinic-based care with home-based care, appear promising. There is a clear need for appropriately powered studies examining combination interventions. Standardizing the key outcomes applied across these studies can streamline limited resources, maximize the impact of research, and yield effective interventions to improve health outcomes for adolescents and youth living with HIV.",
