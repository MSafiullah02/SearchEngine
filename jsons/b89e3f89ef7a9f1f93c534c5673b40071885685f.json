Since no official name has been given to the new human coronavirus by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses yet, the name ''HCoV-NL63'' was used tentatively to designate the virus in this study. Since their sequence studies showed that HCoV-NL63 was related most closely to HCoV-229E, it was classified into group 1 [Fouchier et al., 2004; van der Hoek et al., 2004] .

            "text": "Bronchiolitis is an acute, inflammatory respiratory illness in children occurring mainly in the first 2 years of life. hRSV is the virus detected most frequently detected virus in patients with bronchiolitis, reported detection rates being 50%-60% [Andreoletti et al., 2000; Papadopoulos et al., 2002; Jartti et al., 2004] . Respiratory picornavirus is the second-most frequent agent, and has been detected in 20%-40% of bronchiolitis cases [Andreoletti et al., 2000; Papadopoulos et al., 2002; Jartti et al., 2004] . hMPV, which has been recognized recently as a causative agent as bronchiolitis, was present in 11%-16% of bronchiolitis cases [Jartti et al., 2004; Xepapadaki et al., 2004] . The detection rate of HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 in bronchiolitis cases has been reported to be only 2% [Papadopoulos et al., 2002; Jartti et al., 2004] . However, there are other causative agents of bronchiolotis that remain to be discovered. van der Hoek et al. [2004] reported an infant with bronchiolitis caused by HCoV-NL63. In this study, HCoV-NL63 was detected in 2.5% of the bronchiolitis cases, indicating that HCoV-NL63 may be one of the causative agents of bronchiolitis. Fouchier et al. [2004] reported that HCoV-NL63 was detected in 4 (2.9%) of 139 patients with respiratory tract infections of unknown etiology. Since the incidence of HCoV-NL63 in patients with respiratory tract infections varies depending on several factors such as age, season, year, and clinical diagnosis, it is difficult to determine the true incidence of the virus. Previous studies showed that outbreaks of HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43 occur every 2-3 years [McIntosh et al., 1970; Hambre and Beem, 1972] . If outbreaks of HCoV-NL63 occur every 2-3 years and this 1-year study was performed in non-outbreak year, there is the possibility of underestimation in this data. In studies by the two Dutch groups, all of the samples positive for HCoV-NL63 were collected in winter. In this study, all the three positive samples were collected in February and March, which is a winter season in Sapporo. This suggests that HCoV-NL63 may have a seasonal peak in winter in Japan as well as in The Netherlands. Although van der Hoek et al. [2004] suggested the cocirculation of multiple subgroups of HCoV-NL63, the sequences of three HCoV-NL63 detected in this study were completely identical to that of HCoV-NL63 (GenBank accession number AY567487). Three nasopharyngeal samples from the three patients were inoculated on LLC-MK2 cells. However, no cytopathic effect was observed during a 3-week culture period (data not shown). The two Dutch groups initially carried out virus isolation of HCoV-NL63 on tertiary monkey kidney cells, and LLC-MK2 cells or Vero cells were used for subsequent virus propagation [Fouchier et al., 2004; van der Hoek et al., 2004] . Tertiary monkey kidney cells may be more sensitive than LLC-MK2 cells for initial isolation of HcoV-NL63.",
