We treated our patient with oseltamivir; it was continued for 9 days, with two daily doses of 50 mg. Oseltamivir is the treatment choice for older children and adults [20] . Nosocomial infection was controlled with broad spectrum antibiotherapy. Clinical features, treatment methods and used drugs for treatment were similar to the cases diagnosed as avian influenza [21] [22] [23] . In addition, we used M-enriched immunoglobulin. A study of 12 cases showed that M-enriched immunoglobulin treatment promotes radiological healing and reduces the need for oxygen in steroid-resistant acute respiratory distress syndrome [24] . We used it as it is beneficial in sepsis and septic shock, in order to supply immunological support, control infection and reduce oxygen requirement [24] [25] [26] . It was successful in reducing oxygen requirements temperature. Immunglobulin treatment used for SARS-CoV seems to improve upon treatment, so more studies are needed to provide evidence [27] . In our opinion, M-enriched immunoglobulin treatment for avian influenza also needs more controlled trials studies. Vaccination against influenza has been available for two decades, although there is not yet any for the H5N1 virus [28] .",
