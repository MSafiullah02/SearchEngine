Physical examination was significant for obesity but no acute distress, and coarse breath sounds bilaterally on auscultation. The rest of the examination was unremarkable. The patient's laboratory test results are given in Table 2 . The influenza A test was positive. The nasopharyngeal swab was sent for COVID-19 testing, which was reported positive a couple of days later. A chest x-ray showed a right lower lobe infiltrate (Fig. 1) . The patient was initially admitted to the medical department and was started on Tamiflu 30 mg by mouth twice a day for 5 days, along with azithromycin and ceftriaxone for treatment of community-acquired pneumonia, and hydroxychloroquine for suspected COVID-19 as per hospital protocol. The patient was started on intravenous (IV) normal saline for acute kidney injury with improvement in renal function. However, the patient's clinical condition deteriorated with hypoxia despite the use of high-flow oxygen and she was transferred to the intensive care unit when the initial ABG showed a pH of 7.3, PO 2 of 59 mmHg and PCO 2 of 45 mmHg despite the fact that she was on highflow oxygen via a nasal cannula at 40 l/min. Subsequently, the patient was intubated and ventilated. Her losartan was stopped, while IV fluids were continued. However, renal deterioration progressed so IV fluids were also discontinued and the patient was started on diuretics. Nevertheless, renal failure continued to worsen and as the patient was found to be dehydrated, diuretics were stopped. Urine output subsequently increased, and the creatinine improved to 1.5, closer to the patient's baseline value. The patient continues to be ventilator-dependent with minimal settings with an Fio2 of 30% with a plan for tracheostomy and percutaneous gastrostomy tube placement.",

The lung is the main organ affected, which can result in respiratory failure. The disease can also present with atypical symptoms such as nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea [1] . Influenza in the USA occurs mainly during winter, and the burden of disease is determined by several factors, including the effectiveness of the vaccine that season, the characteristics of the circulating viruses, and how long the season lasts. According to CDC estimates, during the 2018-2019 season symptomatic influenza occurred in approximately 35 million patients, which resulted in approximately 16 million hospital visits and approximately 500,000 hospitalizations with 34,000 deaths [3] . The most common symptoms of influenza are fever, cough, shortness of breath, fatigue, headache, myalgia and arthralgia, similar to those of COVID-19. COVID-19 can simultaneously present with other infections such as influenza, and it can be hard to distinguish the symptoms of the two conditions from each other. However, there are differences and these are summarized in Table 3 [1] . A study by Xing et al. analysed common respiratory pathogens presenting as co-infections with COVID-19 from Quingdao and Wuhan. This report identified IgM antibodies to at least one respiratory pathogen in 80% and 2.6% of the patients from Quingdao and Wuhan, respectively. Influenza A, influenza B, followed by Mycoplasma and Legionella, were the most common respiratory pathogens detected [4] .",
