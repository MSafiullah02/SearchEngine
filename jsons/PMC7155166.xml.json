The city metabolisms comprise of the remark of goods and the yield of waste with consonant adversary externalities that amplify economic and social troubles. In addition the standard of urban sustainability has increased and should respond to people\u2019s necessities through solutions for these aspects [5], [6]. The smart city concept is far from being restricted to the utilization of technologies in cities. In point of fact, the use of the name is growing in several sectors without the agreement of definitions. It led to chaos among urban policy makers and hopes that the policies will make their cities smart. Cities search for solutions that allow mixed land uses, transportation linkages, and economical high-quality urban services all over the world. As shown in Fig. 30.2\n, this more efficient and high-quality transport that responds to economic requirements and associated labor is considered an essential element for the growth of cities [7], [8], [9], [10].",

Today, there is a noteworthy rise in the infectious diseases that affect humans, animals, and plants [12]. Particularly, in undeveloped countries, various diseases, including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), malaria, and tuberculosis, affect a lot of people [13]. Viruses are parasites and require the host cell to generate and replication. Complex protection mechanisms have been developed by mammalian cells to detect and hinder viral replication. In response, they are capable of breaking down and controlling the host immune reactions. This has allowed the growth of viruses that are proficient at destroying host immune reactions [14].",

Because of the needs for prompt diagnosis in more stable, economical, and selective nanosensor technology, various recognition molecules have been analyzed to develop in sensing devices [25]. Nanosensors comprise recognition elements and transducers [26]. The principal bases on the capturing of target and conversion of responses to signals. Nanosensors can be classified into five classes: electrochemical [27], optic [28], piezoelectric [29], thermal [30], and magnetic [31]. Over the previous decades, nanosensors have evolved to be significant for identifying analytes from explosive [32] to protein [33], nucleic acid [34], carcinogens [35], bacteria [36], virus [37] and toxin [38] in food processing [39], environmental monitoring [40], clinical diagnostics [41], and fight against bioterrorism [42].\n",

Nanosensors offer multiple abilities, including practicable operation, exceptional performance, high specificity and sensitivity, rapid response, condensed size, portability, and real-time analysis [45]. In these days, investigators improve the specificity and sensitivity of the methods by focusing on the nanosensor production quality, extending the affinity between the surface chemistries and employing nanocomposites, such as nanofilm [46], gold nanoparticle [47], or quantum dot [48], for signal amplification studies.",

            "text": "Electrochemical nanosensors have been applied in several applications. These nanosensors include screen-printed electrodes and semiconductors and monitor any changes in dimension, dielectric properties, charge distribution, and shape, while the complex is produced on the electrode. They can be separated into three groups, amperometric, impedimetric, and potentiometric transducers, and utilized to detect various targets [49], [50], [51]. Optic nanosensors measure the change of the reflective index of the transducer when the target and recognition element produce a complex. These nanosensors can be classified into two types. In the direct optic nanosensors, signal generation is based on the production of a complex on the transducer surface, whereas the indirect optic nanosensors are mostly designed with various labels to detect the binding and extend the signal. Although indirect sensing nanosensors can create higher signals, they suffer from high reagent cost of labeling step and nonspecific binding [52], [53]. They have a multipurpose detection scale and sense various kinds of biomolecules from different specimens [54], [55]. Piezoelectric nanosensors measure mass change and viscoelasticity by recording frequency and modifying a quartz crystal resonator [56], [57]. The sensing needs isolation equipment that minimizes any hindrance effects because of the high sensitivity to environmental circumstances. These nanosensors have been used in a wide variety of applications to identify targets [58], [59]. Thermal nanosensors exploit the fundamental property of biological reactions, such as absorption or evolution of heat. This is reflected as a change in the temperature within the reaction medium. In thermal nanosensors, heat is measured using sensitive thermistors that are frequently selected as temperature transducers. A number of instruments have been laid out in the past decades, and they integrated the fundamentals of enzyme catalysis, calorimetry, flow injection analysis, and immobilization on suitable matrices [60], [61], [62]. Magnetic nanosensors carry out magnetic beads coated with a ligand, and they can be detected within a magnetic field. They propose distinct advantages, such as when a sample selected for analysis does not contain any contaminating materials with magnetic properties, background signals are minimized. In addition, not only new avenues of research and clinical methods have been successfully formed, including hyperthermia treatment, magnetic actuation, targeted drug delivery, and the use of magnetic particles, but also bioassays based on fluorescent detection or well-established sequencing methods in genetics have been challenged [63], [64].",

These nanosheets were acquired by exfoliating their layered etched powder and exhibited high fluorescence quenching ability to dye-labeled single-stranded DNA and different affinities for single-stranded and double-stranded DNA.

The largest outbreak of Ebola virus infection is discussed in Ref. [88]. Such advanced superiorities would be perfect for fast, point-of-care detection of Ebola virus [89]. Natesan et al. produced a digital nanosensor to detect Ebola virus. Their nanosensor had a flow cell assay that captured specific antibodies with microarrayed recombinant antigens and a smartphone fluorescent reader for high-performance clarification of results. They showed that the smartphone reader utilized a hardware attachment that snapped at the back of a smartphone and provided a user interface to handle the operation, communicate with cloud service, and acquire test results. They also developed a secure cloud service for the tele-monitoring of results. They tested these nanosensor results with sera from nonhuman primates that received a live attenuated Ebola vaccine [90]. Ilkhani et al. invented an electrochemical nanosensor to identify Ebola virus. They first marked it with a streptavidin\u2013alkaline phosphatase conjugate and optimized all the steps and then received a low detection limit value. They finally accomplished selectivity and reproducibility [91]. Yanik et al. constructed an optofluidic nanosensor that detects whole viruses. Their nanosensor was based on a light transmission impact and used group-specific antibodies. They applied in a range spanning three orders of magnitude. They modified antibodies against the Ebola glycoprotein on the nanosensors, and transmission spectra were collected after the cleaning process [92].",

They detected 10 copies of human adenovirus in 30 minutes. They also validated the clinical utility and declared that this tool proposed a sensitive and rapid detection with simplicity, low cost, and short assay time [107]. Guerreiro et al. exhibited a genetically encoded switch-on fluorescent nanosensor comprising acyclized green fluorescent protein (cVisensor) with an adenoviral protease cleavable site (Fig. 30.6\n). They first optimized nanosensor and then established virus detection by stable expression in mammalian cells and utilized for live-cell monitoring of adenovirus infection. They obtained a flow cytometry-based assay using cVisensor cells 48 hours postinfection and showed the limit of detection value as 105 infectious particles/mL [108].",

They demonstrated that their nanosensor was capable of verifying the existence of viral molecules and color changes of gold nanoparticles in the UV\u2013vis wavelength range. They planned a pair of thiol-modified probes at either the 5\u2032 end or 3\u2032 end to coordinate complementary base pairs with upstream of the E protein gene and open reading frames. In addition, they reported that colorimetric nanosensor could discriminate down to 1 pmol/\u03bcL of 30 bp Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus [109]. Trzaskowskia et al. investigated the possibility of using optic nanosensor in the detection of tuberculosis in sputum. First, they designed a portable surface plasmon resonance apparatus and referred its performance with a standard desktop surface plasmon resonance platform via measuring the response to tuberculosis secretory protein. Then, they examined samples of suspended Mycobacterium tuberculosis cultures and sputum samples of tuberculosis patients. They claimed that this nanosensor was able to detect M. tuberculosis secretory protein and also able to determine tuberculosis bacteria cultures in the concentration of 1\u00d7104\n cfu/mL with no significant interfering response from two other bacteria species [110]. Weerathunge et al. offered a colorimetric nanosensor to detect infective murine norovirus. They integrated the gold nanoparticles that have enzyme\u2013mimic catalytic activity with a murine norovirus aptamer and noticed that this nanosensor created a blue color in the being of norovirus. They also found the detection limit as three viruses per assay, which is equal to 30 viruses/mL of the sample [111].",

They should be stable, simple, robust, reliable, and affordable and also have high detection capability, especially in clinical applications. Nanosensor feasibility also seems to begin leaving the proof of concept, and several analytes have already been detected to demonstrate the versatility of the nanosensors. In some particular cases the validation with real samples in clinical scenarios strengthens nanosensors suitability. There are still some doubts to overcome as some portable nanosensors have recently been studied at the research level. Though the progression is quite slow, a significant advancement in smartphone technology has helped mobile health diagnostics to deploy at developing countries. The exponential increase in mobile application development and the affordability of these platforms have revolutionized health delivery and opened a new window in global health access.\n",
