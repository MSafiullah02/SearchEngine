For any infectious disease, there are three kinds of way to control the epidemic of infectious disease\u2010that is, to control the source of infection, to cut off transmission routes, and to protect the susceptible population. As a new infectious disease, it is difficult to develop a safe and effective vaccine against COVID\u201019 in a short period of time. So, it is not possible to protect susceptible population at present. Social distancing is one of the main ways to cut off transmission routes \u2013 people cannot pass on infection if they do not come into contact with other people. Based on the understanding that COVID\u201019 spreads through respiratory droplets, there has been widespread use of face masks in Wuhan. The propaganda \"no masks, no going outside\" has been adopted by the public. This can help to cut off the transmission routes of COVID\u201019. Increases in capacity for laboratory testing, allowing treatment and isolation of COVID\u201019 patients also helps to reduce onwards transmission. In the period of initial success for COVID\u201019 control and prevention, one bottleneck has been screening out asymptomatic carriers for reducing new infections. As frontline doctors, we believe that there have been asymptomatic carriers of COVID\u201019 who can infect their close contacts.",

The child was virologically confirmed to have an asymptomatic infection. In addition, another family of three who travelled from Wuhan to Guangzhou was reported to be infected with COVID\u201019.\n4\n The father had clinical symptoms, a decreased lymphocyte count, abnormal chest CT images, and a positive result on qRT\u2010PCR. It's interesting that the mother and the son were both asymptomatic, with normal lymphocyte counts and chest CT images but positive qRT\u2010PCR for COVID\u201019 infection.",

We presume there would be many other asymptomatic carriers who were never tested. Even if those carriers were in the hospital, perhaps for another reason, would the doctor think of doing a viral nucleic acid test for COVID\u201019 in time? If it is not possible to screen these asymptomatic carriers from truly healthy populations, they will be a source of COVID\u201019 infection back into the community, which will also pose a huge challenge for COVID\u201019 prevention and control.",

On February 9, a man was released from prison and returned home. But he was informed to isolate himself because a prison officer was confirmed to have COVID\u201019 infection on February 14. In order to avoid isolation and observation, the man absconded from his home. Later, it was confirmed that this man was an asymptomatic carrier, and his brother who had close contact with him became infected with COVID\u201019. This case is an example of asymptomatic transmission. One study has reported that the viral load that was detected in the asymptomatic patients was similar to that in the symptomatic patients, which also theoretically suggests the potential transmission of asymptomatic patients.\n5\n\n",
