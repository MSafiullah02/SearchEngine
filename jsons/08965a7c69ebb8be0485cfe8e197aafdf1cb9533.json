As polymerases of a number of viruses had been shown to be attractive targets for the development of DAA therapeutics, we embarked on this discovery with the assurance of at least some successful precedent [4] . At the inception of our research, the optimal therapy for HCV patients required extended (48 weeks) co-administration of pegylated interferon-\u03b1 (Peg-IFN) and ribavirin (RBV), a regime that resulted in only 40-50% of genotype 1 patients achieving a sustained viral response (SVR), as defined as the absence of detectable viral RNA in serum 6 months after conclusion of treatment [5] . Additionally, Peg-IFN treatments are associated with severe flu-like side effects, as well as fatigue, drowsiness, and anemia. This leads to significant patient discontinuations despite the severe prognosis of the untreated disease [6] . The necessity to address the substantial unmet medical need with a well-tolerated and effective oral therapy was the compelling impetus for the initiation of our research.",

In this review, the biochemical enzyme assays (for which IC 50 s are reported) were performed with recombinant wild-type NS5B (genotype 1b, Con1) containing a carboxyl-terminal deletion of 18 amino acids and a resistance variant containing a single amino acid substitution, P495L. The inhibition of the incorporation of radiolabeled nucleotides in these transcriptional assays was detected using scintillation proximity assay (SPA) beads [16] . Compound inhibitory activities were also determined in replicon systems (for which we report EC 50 s) consisting of human hepatocyte-derived cell lines (Huh-7) that constitutively express sub-genomic HCV RNA (genotypes 1b and 1a, Con1 and H77c, respectively) encoding essential cis-elements and the HCV nonstructural proteins required for RNA replication. Inhibition of viral RNA replication correlates with a decrease in HCV RNA and protein production. Reduction in HCV replication was measured indirectly by monitoring HCV NS3 protease activity using a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay [17] [18] [19] . The cytotoxicity of compounds in the replicon host cells was determined by measurement of the fluorescence of Alamar blue dye, an indicator of mitochondrial function and cellular metabolism. Given the lack of success in identifying progressable leads from in-house sources, the program's focus shifted to the evaluation of reported inhibitors, and we initially attempted to characterize and investigate the indole and benzimidazole chemotypes 1 and 2 ( Fig. 1) [20, 21] . While these compounds exhibited modest antiviral activity in the genotype 1b replicon assay (EC 50 values of 400 nM and 100 nM, respectively), both displayed good cellular therapeutic indexes (CC 50 /EC 50 > 20) , and it was considered that opportunities existed to address what appeared to be structural and physiochemical liabilities in these series.",

            "text": "Considering first compound 1, of the many initiatives undertaken with this chemotype, one of the more productive involved a de-annulation derived from a one-carbon excision from the parent heterocycle [22] . This generated the imidazoleappended acrylate 3 shown in Fig. 2 . Encouragingly, this derivative retained a significant activity and prompted the evaluation of a number of isosteric heterocycles. Unfortunately, in the case of 1,3,5-substituted pyrazoles, as exemplified by compound 4, it was disappointing that these proved to be less active than the parent benzimidazole. Interestingly, however, the isomeric derivative 5 was found to be essentially equipotent with the original lead; this was attributed to a reduction in allylic strain in a putative bioactive conformation [22] . In modeling studies, the differences in potencies of many of the heterocycles explored could be most comprehensively rationalized by considering subtle variations in the vectors defined by the distances between the cyclohexyl moiety and the acid functionalities of the various analogs tested. It was known that the cyclohexyl group appeared to function as an anchor, binding the ligand to NS5B; variations in the distances between this functionality and the acid moieties were projected to modulate key binding interactions between each of the ligands' carboxylate moieties and Arg503 of NS5B, and this concept could rationalize much of the potency variations observed with the analogs explored. Given the preference for the geometry presented by compound 5, this molecular silhouette was used in subsequent studies as a template to assess a series of derivatives represented by the generic structure shown in Fig. 3 .",

In addition, it was anticipated that such a strategy would induce a degree of pre-organization through conformational constraint, as well as provide a scaffold from which additional functionality could be extended along unique vectors. In some variants of this basic concept, additional polarity was introduced into the system through the incorporation of heteroatoms and polar linking moieties within the bridging groups themselves. To explore these concepts, the simple 6-carboxylate derivatives were examined first as these would lead to lower molecular weight, non-amidic analogs. However, to fully assess the potential of the bridging elements, the related cinnamic acid conjugates were also considered. This led to the synthesis of the indolo-fused heterocycles shown in Fig. 6 . The low-energy geometries of the truncated indolo acids were explored using molecular mechanics employing an OPLS force field [24] . Optimized structures are shown in Fig. 7 , and the dihedral angles between the phenyl and indole rings for each heterocycle are listed in Table 1 . In the interpretation of the subsequently derived structure-activity relationships (SARs), compounds 8 and 9 were used as primary comparators.",

The optimized dihedral angles between the pendent phenyl and the indole cores did not appear to be key determinants of activity since equipotent derivatives with inclinations between these moieties of between 43 and 70 were observed. This suggested that the preferred bioactive conformations could be easily accessed in all of the ring systems explored. None of the indolo-fused heterocyles are rigid, and, correspondingly, any entropic factors positively contributing to binding may be quite modest. This, in conjunction with the observation that the introduction of polarity into various positions on the bridging elements was not only tolerated, but could be associated with further improvements in activity, as seen in analogs 12 through 16, was supportive of the Within the extended cinnamate series, compound 15 was of particular note given its exquisite potency, displaying EC 50 values of 10 nM and 8 nM against genotypes 1a and 1b, respectively. This represented a milestone within the program since it achieved the clinical candidate potency objectives of <10 nM against both of the primary targeted viral genotypes. A co-crystal structure of this analog complexed to NS5B [1b Bartenschlager construct] was obtained and is shown in Fig. 8 [25, 26] .",

The amidic N-H moiety of the proximal carboxamide forms a hydrogen bond with ARG 503, and the terminal carboxylate forms a salt bridge with R498. The fused, formerly pendent phenyl group lies in a hydrophobic cleft on the surface of NS5B and is inclined at an angle of~46 relative to the indole ring. This is similar to that observed in the minimized structure of the indolobenzazepinones 14 and 15 and in these specific analogs doubtless contributes to their potency. It should be noted that in the above structure and in others that were obtained, the \u03941 finger domain of the enzyme could not be resolved due to disorder in this region of the peptide.

All showed low bioavailability and all exhibited moderate to high clearances. This could be rationalized by recognizing that these analogs retained both the polyamidic and acidic character of the original lead. Much more interesting, however, was that the acidic polar lactam 14 exhibited significantly improved exposure despite displaying high clearance.

However, the exposure profiles of these simple indole carboxylates following oral dosing to rats were frequently poor, as noted above. Correspondingly, a concurrent parallel effort was directed at the evaluation of acid isosteres, and a particularly productive discovery was the identification of the N,N-dimethylsulfamide moiety, as exhibited in analogs 20, 21, and 22 [27] . 1 This modification not only modestly enhanced the activity of the series but was also found to obviate the glucuronidation issue noted previously. With the acylsulfamide 20, potencies approaching 100 nM were achieved against the primary genotypes of interest with an analog with a significantly improved PK profile: Compound 20 was 30% orally bioavailable in the rat at a dose of 5 mpk, and achieved liver levels of 24 \u03bcM, as determined 4 h post dose in an abbreviated PK study. Further optimization of the chemotype was directed at identifying optimal substituents on the fused aryl moiety. The introduction of additional functionality at this position on the chemotype was challenging, given that the diversity elements had to be introduced at an early stage of the synthesis, as can be appreciated from the route depicted in Fig. 11 .",

However, continued profiling of analogs in this series demonstrated that the introduction of steric bulk around the ether element of the morpholine ring could eliminate this property, and with the simple 2,6-dimethylmorpholine derivative 22, a benchmark compound was identified that exhibited a potent and balanced genotype inhibition profile (EC 50 1a/1b \u00bc 40/40 nM) and a PXR IC 50 value of >10 \u03bcM. In rat PK studies, this compound also exhibited high liver levels of 33 \u03bcM when measured 4 h after an oral dose of 10 mg/kg. Strongly encouraged by what had been achieved, further modifications to the bridging tethers were aggressively investigated. A particularly fruitful finding in this area involved a cyclopropanation of the olefin group in the fused benzazepine moiety of the parent heterocycle.

Furthermore, this modification had the added advantage of removing a potential Michael acceptor (although in biotransformation studies on the parent heterocycles, this reactivity was never observed).",

The data on selected key examples from this endeavor are shown in Fig. 13 . In reviewing these data, what became immediately apparent was that for those enantiomers with the R configuration at the carboxamide-appended carbons, as in 41 and 43, an approximately fiveto tenfold enhancement of antiviral activity was observed relative to the unsaturated congeners 19 and 20. Contrastingly, the cyclopropyl antipodes 40 and 42 were essentially equipotent with the related indolobenzazepines. Importantly, these observations confirmed a working hypothesis that the introduction of the cyclopropane modification with the correct stereochemistry might be associated with some enhancement in activity. This was predicated on modeling studies in which potential binding modes of 42 and 43 in Site I of the thumb domain of NS5B were compared, as shown in Fig. 14 [38] . In these models, both enantiomers are presented in what is calculated to be optimized conformations, and both compounds exhibit a number of redundant interactions with the enzyme. However, relative to 42, the antipode 43 participates in additional productive contacts, most notably between elements in the morpholine moiety and the side-chain methyl group of residue T399, as well as interaction between the polarized methylene hydrogen atoms in the cyclopropyl group and the backbone carbonyl oxygen of L492. Furthermore, the carbonyl oxygen of the acylsulfamide in 43 is better positioned for optimal H-bonding with R503. This is in contrast to what is predicted with 42, where steric impediments between the morpholine ring and the acylsulfamide reduce the latter's engagement with R503. Additionally, the disposition of the cyclopropyl moiety in 42 prevented contact of its methylene hydrogens with the carbonyl oxygen of L492. Although not apparent from these static models, it was considered reasonable to assume that the cyclopropyl moiety introduced a degree of conformational constraint within the indolobenzazepine ring system and R. G. Gentles that this might also contribute to the stabilization of the bound conformation shown in Fig. 14b . As in prior studies, substitutions on the fused aryl ring were investigated and consistent with those experiences, and the 4-methoxy group was again identified as a preferred aryl substituent. Exemplified by the racemic cyclopropyl-fused analogs 44 and 45 shown in Table 3 , there was a trend toward increased activity with the 4-methoxy derivatives, and the activity differential was more pronounced in the presence of 40% human serum. This effect was attributed to protein binding, and the modest right shift shown for 45 was observed with many members of this chemotype. However, with other closely related compounds, minor structural modifications were observed to result in pronounced loss of potency in the presence of serum.",

The primary drivers of binding are interactions between the cyclohexyl, phenyl, and indole elements of the molecule with hydrophobic amino acid side chains in the binding site, in combination with H-bonds between the sulfamide moiety and R503. Additional contacts between the methylene moiety of the cyclopropyl ring and the ethano-bridged N-methyl piperazine group and the proximal L492, T399, and A400 residues also contribute to binding affinity. Significantly, P495 is seen to make multiple contacts with the indole ligand, explaining the reduced activity of 66 in assays utilizing the P495A and P495L mutant NS5B proteins (e.g., IC 50 WT 1b/P495L \u00bc 0.02/0.19 \u03bcM). Returning to a point made first when introducing the bridged indole chemotype, the dihedral angle between the fused methoxyaryl moiety and the indole ring in 66 is 44 ; this approximates that seen for the same dihedral (43 ) in compound 14, the analog that was the essential precursor for most of the work that was described subsequently [23] . The mode of binding observed with 66 suggests an explanation for its probable mechanism of action, where occupation of a lipophilic pocket in the thumb domain of NS5B is believed to prevent the enzyme from adopting a transcriptionally active conformation, as outlined below [56] .",

In the apo structure shown in Panel A, Leu-30 of the \u03941 loop of NS5B is observed to occupy the same pocket into which the cyclohexyl moiety of 66 inserts when it binds to the enzyme, as shown in Panel B. It is thought that Leu-30 occupies this pocket during transcription of the viral genome and that this interaction contributes to the stabilization of the transcriptionally active, \"closed\" conformation. However, when this residue is displaced by the binding of compound 66, the enzyme can no longer adopt this conformation, and viral replication is prevented. Consistent with this hypothesis, kinetic studies indicate that the \u03941 finger domains interact dynamically with Site I in the thumb domain and appear to compete with 66 during its initial binding to NS5B [56] .",

Antiviral activity was observed in all dose groups, with those patients receiving the 300 mg dose exhibiting an approximately 2.5 log 10 IU/mL decline in viral load measured 24 h post-dosing. Single doses of 66 exhibited dose-related increases in exposure, demonstrated rapid and exposure-related antiviral activity, and were well tolerated.

The Phase 3 studies [61] investigated the use of DCV-TRIO in both cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic patients infected with HCV genotype 1 for a period of 12 weeks. In the open-label UNITY-1 study, DCV-TRIO was dosed without ribavirin in both treatment-na\u00efve and treatment-experienced non-cirrhotic patients. The treatment-na\u00efve group (n \u00bc 312) and the treatment-experienced patients (n \u00bc 103) received one pill twice daily for 12 weeks with 24 weeks of follow-up.
