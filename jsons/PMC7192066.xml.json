This requires establishing and navigating new physical spaces as work settings that are absent the tangible and intangible resources of typical workspaces. Of course, remote work is not possible in every industry, leading to employees having to manage their occupations in increasingly unpredictable and vulnerable settings, or many having to deal with losing their jobs altogether. Importantly, where, how, and what we decide to do for work are foundational for meaningful engagement; work environments are vital spaces for collaborative productivity and creative expression (McCoy, 2002) and crafting one's sense of contribution to the world (Wrzesniewski & Dutton, 2001). Studies suggest that work affords individuals the ability to perceive their daily tasks as personally meaningful, which promotes a broader sense of coherence and belief that they can make a positive impact (Steger, Dik, & Duffer, 2012). Parallel evidence exists in studies of retirement or work-preventing injuries, wherein discernible declines in sense of purpose have been found among those who no longer or are unable to work (Hill & Weston, 2019; Saunders & Nedelec, 2014).",

To reconcile person-organization fit in these new environments, organizations may need to identify ways to remind employees of how their contributions align with an overarching mission, as more traditional signals of collective performance may be less evident. While virtual meetings and online workspaces are not novel, future research might identify a range of individual differences that may inform who is most likely to remain engaged with work activities when they are mandated to occur remotely (Kissmer, Knoll, Stieglitz, & Gross, 2018). Moreover, for those who lose jobs or live in regions with disproportionately high levels of unemployment, the challenge of preserving a formerly held sense of purpose may be even more formidable. Past research has suggested that individuals higher on conscientiousness \u2013 a disposition toward being hardworking, organized and achievement striving \u2013 is predictive of greater losses in well-being following job loss (Boyce, Wood, & Brown, 2010); given the conceptual connection to purposefulness, studies are needed to understand whether sense of purpose may itself be a risk factor for people dealing with job loss. Income loss, concerns over labor-market security, and limited opportunities to socialize about work experiences are likely to undermine well-being and sense of purpose (Clark, Knabe, & R\u00e4tzel, 2010; McKee-Ryan, Son, Wanberg, & Kinicki, 2005).",

            "text": "Another person-environment interaction being drastically disrupted concerns education. Schools and universities are closing their physical campuses, forcing instruction online. As virtual teaching replaces face-to-face interaction, educators and students must navigate sustaining learning while safeguarding trusted and supportive relationships. When schools prioritize these relationships, they can be instrumental settings for purpose development (Bronk, 2013; Koshy & Mariano, 2011), especially when teachers, coaches, and mentors are responsive to student interests and scaffold opportunities for achievement. Remote learning environments pose obvious challenges to this type of responsiveness: without in-person contact, the sparks of early interest and curiosity that may otherwise proliferate to become purposes may be less visible (Kashdan & Yuen, 2007; Zhang & Bonk, 2006). Of course, virtual technologies can offer several benefits, including providing students with cost-efficient and time-saving access to materials and alternative ways to visualize content and engage with content (Henderson, Selwyn, & Aston, 2017). Yet, such benefits have largely emerged when instructors have deliberately chosen to implement online components to learning \u2013 not when they are mandated by external imposition. In adapting to virtual instruction, whether teachers are able to cultivate student purpose may depend on their ability to creatively foster connections to students at distance, and tailor them to the diverse ways students may be oriented to learning in virtual settings (Misra & Stokols, 2012).",

That teaching is perceived as a calling for many in the profession has been well-established (Day & Qing, 2009; Palmer, 1998), thus helping students achieve must be recognized for its potential to fulfill important life aims. Yet, as physical and social constraints obscure familiar practices and roles, the current pandemic stands to also alter how teachers feel, identify themselves, and pursue their aims. There is evidence to suggest that teachers tasked with transitioning to remote instruction undergo a transformative process ranging from initial resistance to embracing new pedagogical modifications to help students (Redmond, 2011). Yet, such transformation may be muddled for teachers abruptly forced to adopt remote instruction practices, without an opportunity chose how they can be meaningfully aligned with their unique style and educational aims. Thus, teachers' sense of role and contribution represent a critical target for inquiry in understanding how the landscape of education is currently being transformed. There are likely to be key individual differences in teachers\u2019 abilities and willingness shift to remote instruction that are in need of discovery and assistance through helpful intervention.",

Keeping sufficient distance from others minimizes the likelihood of infection, but in doing so creates an iatrogenic impediment to social connection. Perceiving support from others correlates strongly with feeling purposeful (Weston, Lewis, & Hill, in press), and engaging with a purpose often necessitates making an impact beyond oneself (Damon, Menon, & Cotton Bronk, 2003). This can be challenging when interpersonal interaction is limited. Being unable to visit in close proximity with friends, family, or neighbors is a painful sacrifice in the context of Covid-19, and risks lowering individuals\u2019 sense of purpose. Indeed, reliable social connections, evidence of belonging, and sense of familiar place have all been found to be robust predictors of purpose (Lambert, Stillman, Hicks, Kamble, Beumeister, & Fincham, 2013; Steptoe & Fancourt, 2020).",

In one sense, the issue of physical proximity pervades those previously discussed insofar that it questions how we can maintain sense of purpose, in the absence of our typically close associates who recognize and appreciate our efforts. However, the absence of physical proximity to others presents additional unique challenges, insofar that social isolation and ostracism prove problematic for a sense of purpose (Stillman et al., 2009), likely because we feel less engaged with life. Indeed, though the media has focused on the economic toll of the physical distancing guidelines, the limitations on in-person contact hold broader consequence for purposefulness in the pandemic, which may prove difficult to mitigate solely through virtual connections.",

At a particularly formative developmental period for cultivating a purpose and identity (Burrow & Hill, 2011; Malin, Ballard, & Damon, 2015), restrictions on social gatherings could be deleterious for future participation in activities such as sports, volunteering, or political campaigns (Burrow, 2015; Sumner, Burrow, & Hill, 2018).

            "text": "To fortify this research agenda, we offer the following testable hypotheses to guide inquiry into how disruptions caused by Covid-19 should impact purpose immediately and in the future. First, as obstacles to engaging with work diminish our sense of contribution, those who are better able to leverage remote technologies to maintain engagement in daily tasks should feel more purposeful. Second, as virtual instruction challenges learning and limits educators' ability to recognize student interests, activities that allow students to personalize their learning and connect with teachers to share insights should afford richer prospects for cultivating purpose. Third, a sense of purpose should be greatest among those who exploit opportunities to engage collaboratively and in community with others within the confines of physical distancing policies. Those for whom physical proximity is less tethered to social proximity should be expected to retain a sense of belonging and that they can contribute to others. Finally, just as contending with this pandemic is likely to change societies in profound and permanent ways, we call for an openness to a change in the kinds of questions researchers ask about purpose \u2013 questions that will need to more fully incorporate features of the environments in which people's lives unfold. As a salubrious resource for life engagement, we look forward to sustained attention to these person-environment interactions and discovering enduring ways of helping people maintain a sense of purpose.",
