Some macrophage mediators dampen the inflammatory response. IL-6 downregulates production of TNF and IL-1\u03b2, and appears to be important in the resolution phase [6].

However, AOM with spontaneous rupture of the tympanic membrane may have a mainly bacterial aetiology. Studies have shown higher levels of IL-8 in virus-containing exudates [28], but we saw no effect of the absence or presence of viruses on any of the inflammatory mediators.",

However, an infection so powerful as to sever the tympanic membrane is probably caused by highly virulent bacteria such as pneumococci [30]. In conclusion, we assume that the pathogens of importance are S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae and, to a lesser extent, M. catarrhalis and S. pyogenes, and that the absence of detectable bacteria depends on their active elimination shortly after killing of the bacteria. Our results further suggest that once the bacteria are dead and fragmented, the production of proinflammatory cytokines ceases rapidly.",
