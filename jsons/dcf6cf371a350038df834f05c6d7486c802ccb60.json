We used more-com-prehensive diagnostic methods than other researchers and more often detected adenovirus during URI; the virus was also associated with the highest rate of AOM-complicated URI. We were surprised that RSV-associated URI was not diagnosed more frequently; this could be because there was an unusually low prevalence of RSV in our community during the study period or because young children with RSV infection tended to have lower respiratory tract disease rather than URI.
