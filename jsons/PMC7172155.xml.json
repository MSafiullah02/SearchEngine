            "text": "Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is a common disease and a significant cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide [1]. The severity of the disease can be affected by various factors including age, immune status of the host, and the single or mixed infection. The etiology of CAP is essential because most respiratory illnesses lead to similar clinical presentations. Currently, the ambiguous of etiology and lack of a microbiological diagnosis in CAP impairs pathogen-directed antimicrobial therapy [2]. In the last decade, the long-term implications of respiratory viral infection among susceptible hosts have increasingly been recognized [3]. Although approximately 200 million cases of viral CAP occur every year, the incidence of viral pneumonia still has been underestimated. In hospital, bacteria remain the first consideration in pulmonary infections, and antibiotic therapy is still the cornerstone of the majority of CAP.",

            "text": "Influenza virus infection (IVI) causes annual epidemics that result in estimated 1 billion infections, including 3\u20135 million severe cases and 250,000\u2013500,000 mortality cases worldwide each year [4]. IVI can cause primary viral pneumonia, which may progress to a potentially fatal outcome [5]. It is difficult to distinguish the cause of CAP induced by flu, other respiratory viruses or bacteria based solely on clinical symptoms, and the conventional lab biomarkers of viral and/or bacterial infections do not differ in influenza-positive compared with influenza-negative patients [6]. Influenza can temporarily suppress host immune defenses, leading to bacterial complications [7]. Secondary bacterial pneumonia is a frequent cause of excess mortality during influenza epidemics, but the epidemiology remains unclear [8]. Hospital admissions during the 2009 influenza epidemic season showed a moderate to strong association between influenza and bacterial pneumonia, whereas the interaction is modest or non-existent during non-epidemic periods [9]. Bacteria including streptococcus pneumoniae, hemophilia influenzae, and staphylococcus aureus, often interact with respiratory viruses (esp. the influenza virus), and shape the outcome of respiratory infection [10]. Studies have shown the evidence of bacterial invasion is more than 90% in influenza-infected cases, and the high rates of co-infections exist in these patients, indicating that viral infection may enhance both susceptibility and severity of subsequent bacterial infection [8,11,12]. In vitro studies have shown that influenza infection enhanced susceptibility to pneumococcal pneumonia by about 100-fold in a week, but the interaction between influenza and bacteria is not limited in pneumococcal pneumonia [13]. In the hospital, viral testing among patients with respiratory symptoms is uncommon [14], and the determination of the microbiological etiology is severely hampered in CAP by the difficulty of obtaining specimens from the infected area (esp. from lower respiratory tract), samples could be easily contaminated by respiratory conditioned pathogens. At present, the epidemiological history of influenza-like illness (ILI) and the incidence and clinical presentation of CAP caused by viruses other than influenza during an influenza epidemic season were limited [[15], [16], [17]]. In this study, we report on the surveillance of respiratory microorganisms, and its laboratory biomarkers, in CAP patients admitted to a hospital during the January to August 2016. The specific microbiome patterns, their clinical significance, and the antibacterial/antiviral treatment were analyzed in these patients simultaneous.",

Accurate and rapid etiologic diagnosis is crucial to pathogen-directed therapy. To date, the gold standard for CAP diagnosis is still based on the radiographic findings [22]. The radiological findings of multilobar infiltration or pleural effusion generally indicate greater severity [23]. Although etiological studies have been performed, current microbial diagnostic tests frequently do not allow clinicians to rule out bacterial infection with certainty [24]. Obtaining an qualified sample may be a challenge as specimens were easily contaminated by the bacteria located in upper airways [25]. For increasing the detection rate of pathogens, esp. for infection occurred in the lower respiratory tract, alveolar lavage fluid may be better in reflecting infectious status than the sputum. However, alveolar lavage fluids require semi-invasive surgery, which is certainly not routine in non-intubated patients, esp. to children [2]. Under this condition, taking sputum as the sample is more practical. Therefore, the relevant CAP guidelines recommend sputum examinations for patients with moderate to severe CAP. In this study, a high microbial yield can be achieved when real time PCR assays plus the conventional diagnostic methods, such as bacterial cultures [26,27]. The single-plex real time PCR assay were exploited for detecting 14 respiratory viruses, which could improve diagnostic efficacy, particularly in diagnosing respiratory viral infections [28]. Etiologic diagnosis in the CAP patients reached 63.08%, we still had 36.92% CAP patients without clearly microorganisms diagnose. For patients with comorbidities, the use of antibiotics prior to sampling may obscure a potential bacterial detection [29]. Previous studies revealed that etiology remains unknown in approximately one-half of the cases [30,31], indicating that establishment of a precise pathogen diagnosis for CAP patients is challenging. Better diagnostic methods are warranted to distinguish viral from bacterial CAP, which will clarify if these viral infections cause CAP on their own or merely predispose the patient to bacterial co-infections [32].",

Even there was a severe influenza outbreak during our study, other respiratory viral infections were more than influenza infection (63.16% vs. 36.84%). In all pathogens that cause CAP, bacteria occupied the majority of pathogens, and the most common bacterium was A. baumannii. Our results was not in keeping with the previous studies, in which the most frequently identified pathogens were Burkholderia pseudomallei (29%), S. pneumoniae (20%), K. pneumoniae (19%) and H. influenza (11%), respectively [33]. Although A. baumannii is an important pathogen of nosocomial infections, we often isolated it from infectious patients who is first admitted to the hospital, indicating that A. baumannii has a certain popularity in this area. Most community-acquired cases of A. baumannii pneumonia are from tropical or subtropical countries in the Asia-Pacific region. In Thailand, severe CAP is caused by A. baumannii, and its mortality is 10 times higher than hospital-acquired A. baumannii pneumonia [33,34]. In another aspect, most of our patients had underlying diseases, we could not exclude the possibility that patients had the bacterial infection in last hospital admission. The pathogen remains in the respiratory tract, causing clinical symptoms when the body's immunity is reduced. The outbreak of A. baumannii infection is also associated with multidrug resistance, and carbapenems have been considered to be a major factor in resistance to multidrug-resistant A. baumannii infection [34]. Moreover, the mortality of carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii pneumonia patients is higher than that of carbapenem-sensitive A. baumannii pneumonia patients [35,36].",

            "text": "The microbiome\u2019s characterization and diversity are closely linked to the host status, and the host immune response may play a determining role in the infectious exacerbation of CAP. The intrinsic complexity of the host-microbiome relationship currently limits the clinical indications of microbiome analysis [25]. Diabetes and high blood pressure were the most common underlying disease, which were known to be associated with an increased risk of complications and death among critically ill patients [43]. Detection of respiratory secretions by PCR method has provided a rapid and definitive diagnosis for the ILIs in hospitalized adults [44]. Unfortunately, it is not routine test in most clinic labs. Appropriate empiric therapy is likely to be suboptimal without narrowing diagnostic possibilities to the most likely possibilities pending definitive pathogen identification [44]. Effective, targeted therapy for CAP requires an understanding of the heterogeneity of etiology and the individual host response to infection [45].",
