Being able to interpret the humanities within the context of clinical practice fortifies the ability of students to comprehend patients\u2019 experiences and to understand what they themselves undergo as clinicians. Professionalism, cultural competence, self-reflective practice, and the ability to work with health care teams, is strengthened through a curriculum co-taught by humanities and clinical faculty.",

Also the Biological Weapons Convention, signed by the United States in 1972, resulting in the US program becoming strictly defensive in nature. Students are encouraged to read these treaties, and to discuss the ethical aspects of these weapon systems. In some ways, the ethical issues for physician involvement in chemical and biological warfare are more disturbing to students than simple physician involvement in military medicine. Biological agents in partricular are developed by scientists, often including veterinarians and physicians.",

More than 60% of the buildings in the city were destroyed. Official Japanese figures at the time put the death toll at 118,661 civilians. But later estimates suggest the final toll was about 140,000, of Hiroshima's 350,000 population, including military personnel and those who died later from radiation. Many have also suffered long-term sickness and disability. Three days later, the United States launched a second, bigger atomic bomb against the city of Nagasaki. The device known as \"Fat man,\" after Winston Churchill, weighed nearly 4,050 kg.",

In 2005 Tram\u2019s mother and sisters, were located and the diaries returned to them. The same year the diary(ies) were published in Vietnam.
