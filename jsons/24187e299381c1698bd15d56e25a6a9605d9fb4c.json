One Health promotes public health by studying all factors, such as agriculture, food, and water security, mechanisms of toxicity and pathogenesis of acute and chronic diseases, sociology, economics, and ecosystem health (to name a few). Such an approach is essential because human, animal, and ecosystem health are inextricably linked; therefore, with this One Health approach, we are called to work together to promote, improve, and defend the health and well-being of all by enhancing cooperation and collaboration between physicians, veterinarians social scientists, economists, psychologists, legal professionals, philosophers, and other scientific health and environmental professionals. As such, the One Health movement and approach is a growing vision in global health and is gaining increasing recognition by national and international institutions, organizations, stakeholders, NGOs, and health policymakers. Likewise, the role of world-class universities is pivotal in discovering One Health scientific knowledge and translating them to policy and evidence-based practices. Universities have responsibilities to train future professionals capable of solving global health issues through interdisciplinary scientific knowledge, integrative approaches to teaching, research collaboration, 207 community linkages, and leadership. This chapter discusses the importance of One Health and the role of higher education institutions' One Health partnerships to improve global health.",

            "text": "While Ebola seems to be a mysterious disease with a difficult lineage, the pattern of emerging infectious diseases seems the same. As humankind continues to dominate the ecosystems and destroy forests for harvesting of goods (and thus change the ecology of the host, the pathogen, or a mixture of both), wild animals emerge out of their dwellings and infest humans and their habitat with bacterial or viral infections. Global travel and commerce exchange, including the translocation of animals to new regions of the world, spread animal-borne diseases across nations and continents (Bashford, 2006; Rupprecht, Smith, Fekadu, & Childs, 1995) . Diseases caused by such merging of environments, animals, and human activity seem to be growing and old diseases seem to reemerge. Up to 75% of emerging infectious diseases among humans have zoonotic origins \u00c0 which are diseases transmitted from animals to humans. Just a short list of such diseases include the Hendra and Nipah viruses, the Ross River virus disease, rinderpest in Africa, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), avian and swine influenza, such as creationism. Within evolutionary epistemology, or the biological basis for evolution based on cognitive behavior (or activity) of all organisms (Popper, 1972) , there is an inherent assumption that science itself evolves according to selection. From Popper's work, scientific theories arise not from empirical testing but rather from social and pragmatic methods that closely fit the given problem. Each problem therefore is unique to its environment, and all theories can be made false, but not necessarily true. To explain the evolutionary biological basis behind One Health, we state metaphors from biology that exemplify the underlying philosophy of the One Health approach.",

When cells encounter viruses, for example, they send signals to other cells and study the virus until they can come to conclusions. Specific cells have a way of adapting to the virus's characteristics so that it remembers the virus and when it is encountered again, it knows how to defend the body against that virus. However, when too many viruses contact the cells, and there happens to be no memory of how to encounter the virus, the cells are in trouble and start to die off, causing the disease to run rampant in the rest of the body. This process is complex and adaptive and thus scientists refer to complex adaptive systems to describe many such ecosystems. In university settings, the call is for researchers and educators to together promote this systems-based, complex adaptive approach to work across transdisciplinary lines. However, by the very fact that all these disparate groups are called to function together, several difficulties may have to be overcome. These hindrances involve the boundaries of the definition of One Health itself (Gibbs, 2014) , the complex nature of systems thinking, the difficulties working across transdisciplinary teams, and the traditional structure of universities.",

For example, during the migration of early humans out of Africa, those that survived in the different areas they settled throughout Europe and the rest of the world acquired genes that could cope with the different forms of foods found in those areas. In fact, the microbiomes of each of these geographical survivors established themselves in the context of those unique foods and diets (Trosko, 2014) . Environmental changes affect cultural and behavioral changes (Urry, 2003 (Urry, , 2005 but in turn our cultural behavior affect the environment in this \"anthropocene\" era that we live in. Thus, the ongoing flow of events is a mix of physical and social relations that interacts with the environment. A mix of science, technology, economics, politics, and nature (or the environment) creates a culture that defines our state of being (Latour, 1993) . One Health is aligned with these ideas (Trosko, 2015) .",

The institutions of social structures of communities, of law, of economics, of politics, and religions had to be created to ensure the production and now \"processing\" of foods. These all contribute and are interlinked to the OH concept. Just as the cells in our body self-organize and learn, so do teams of OH people under a growing movement to improve the health of all.

In other words, the concept of physical and biological evolution and cultural evolution needs to be integrated into the definition of \"One Health.\" Over-arching all of this is the fact that all living organisms have DNA (genes) that provided each individual within each species the means to survive these dynamic, broad \"environmental\" interacting factors (such as temperature; time of eating; unique foods and processing of foods; seasonal availability of foods, to name a few examples). That DNA is under constant potential of change from association and interaction with the environment. In addition, even more easily, the expression of specific genes can be modulated at inappropriate times during development resulting in epigenetic toxicity. Thus, the problem with \"One Health\" is that it is very broad and encompasses so many differing fields. There is no microbial \"One Health\" process because our biological change processes lack homogeneity and unidirectional paths. Both virus-driven and host-driven forces for influenza A virus, for example, are subject to constant change because of the nature of viral genes that develop resistance to antiviral drugs or because of the error-prone nature of viral replication (Kocer et al., 2013) .",

However, because of the Western influences on that traditional Japanese diet, the next generation of Japanese women will not contribute to the longest median life span diet, while being important in life span, is not the only factor that is also changing. Patterns of disease occurrences all over the earth are changing because food production, food distribution, economics, and technologies are changing. This causes the delicate inter-dependence of \"One Health\" for all individuals within all species within all the three domains of life \u00c0 (animal, human, and environment). Therefore, the old concept of \"One Health\" has no hope of finding some universal set of scientific principles to maintain all existing life forms in an inevitable dynamically changing world. Indeed, although some microbial scientists define One Health in these terms, finding a universal set of scientific principles is not the goal of the One Health movement. One Health recognizes the tensions in cultural homogenization, that one model will not fit all models, and that, even in doing good, the politically powerless can become even more hegemonized and a complete understanding of world's problems is impossible (Baudrillard, 1995) . Yet, because infectious diseases make us all co-dependent, One Health unites diversity into one common goal. Likewise, Bashford (2006) , a noted health historian, states that a scholarship of global health still needs a biopolitical governance system, one that asks, \"What about the possibility and imperative of health as it was figured internationally, transnationally and even globally over the 20th century?\"",

Food production and agricultural methods have changed, deforestation and consumption of natural goods affect the health of animals, humans and the environment, global transportation systems and worldwide trade of goods transfer diseases more readily than ever before, and climate change affects fauna and animal habitats, increasing the chances for diseases. Such a paradigm shift involves the complex adaptive systems around us such as the interaction of the animals, humans, and the environment. These shifts in the economic and natural environment require all members of the planet to come together to study and improve the planet. These factors all demonstrate that complex adaptive behavior is needed and point to the need for a One Health approach. In this section we described the philosophical underpinnings which led to the definition of One Health as a movement and an approach. In the next section, we will describe how this approach came to be and what the One Health movement intends for collaboration with higher education.",

In developing countries, many health workers receive poor training in patient care and equipment operations (Peabody, Taguiwalo, Robalino, & Frenk, 2006) .

A careful study of the state health system in such a country is necessary to properly engage with stakeholders and leaders.

The nature of chicken farming differs from pig farms, although the latter also serve as incubators of diseases (Hinchliffe, 2015) .

The approach and the movement to unite disciplines to solve these health issues has become the key definition of OH. The practice of OH, which acknowledges the system integration of human health, animal health, and environmental health, has been acknowledged by numerous national and international institutions as the most cohesive and outcomeproducing approach for preventing and controlling diseases at the interface of human, animal, and ecosystems. The expansion of human and animal populations, ecological changes, in particular climate change and global warming, as well as technological advancements, global movement of goods, humans, and animals, have all resulted in an increased risk of emerging and reemerging disease transmission between animals and humans.

Therefore, even at the university level, such complexity makes OH work difficult. First, recent sociological literature points out that complex adaptive systems (such as One Health) require complex adaptive behavior. Adaptive work is suitable for occasions in which no one person has all the answers and only by collaborating together and sharing solutions can they adapt to the situation well enough to solve problems. Working in transdisciplinary teams requires such behavior. There is no one leader, but everyone takes a leadership role as they self-organize around a common problem. They share data from their area of expertise, explain occurrences around their local area, and in doing so, the team comes up with an integrated solution. Contrary to such behavior, traditional universities have a hierarchical structure system based on tenure and publications.",

Researchers should strive to form teams that are greater than the sum of their parts to learn from one another and develop solutions that transcend each discipline. Because OH is a complex and evolving topic, with virulent diseases that are often intractable, complex adaptive leadership may also need to become a part of the curricula. Just as cells (in our body as explained earlier) self-organize and learn, students may need to be taught how to work across collaborative teams, self-organizing around knowledge, and become interdependent, but independent agents. As students learn that a small part of the system can affect behavior of the whole system, they will learn to focus on the interdependencies of systems in both processes as well as in science. We conclude then that One Health curricula include the \"science of team science\" (Stokols, Taylor, Hall, & Moser, 2006) and systems thinking methods around complex adaptive behavior.",

The main problem in universities is that departments work in their own silos and are acculturated for individual rather than integrative work with other departments. Each department's funding structure and accountability structure are all not very conducive for collaborative, transdisciplinary work. Even things like parking structure or lack thereof can hinder collaboration because each discipline is housed in separate buildings. For example, at Michigan State University, many individual scholars are engaged in One Health research with one other person from another department, but for true interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary work to occur, there may need to be at least 4\u00c05 disciplines coming together. Mike Chaddock explains this problem well after having worked on the One Health Initiative at Texas A & M University and now at Michigan State University.

The next step at a university setting like the one at University of Florida, Gainesville, is to inculcate the One Health concept through all colleges and thereby infuse the concept into all curriculum. For this to happen, the faculty may need to work across disciplines to research and to teach. The curriculum may include the science of teamwork, the critical thinking practices required for complex adaptive systems, and the creative thinking methods. These are all elements of adaptive systems thinking (Casti, 1979; Dodder & Dare, 2000) .

Similarly, One Health requires such an infusion because of its multifacetedness and because global health affects the health of all humans on the planet. This third stage of adoption occurs when enough people in the public learn about One Health so that the teaching of the young does not merely occur at the university level but at all levels, from grade school on up, and the vocabulary and the philosophy behind One Health becomes common knowledge. There has yet to be a model of an institutionalization at this third stage, since most people do not yet know what the One Health movement espouses.

The first step is to provide Masters degree programs in epidemiology, public health, and biosecurity with One Health emphasis. Already, Massey University created two online masters in epidemiology and biosecurity (Masters in Public Health & Master of Veterinary Medicine) which attracted a cohort of 70 students from various south Asian countries composed of veterinary and medical professionals. The second step involves educating existing professionals who work in health institutions.

Human health, animal health, and ecosystem health are inextricably linked and with this One Health approach, we must work together to promote, improve, and defend the health and well-being of all by enhancing cooperation and collaboration between physicians, veterinarians, and other scientific health and environmental professionals. The goal of OH is to integrate efforts in human & animal health, public health, agriculture, food and water security, and ecosystem health. The One Health movement and approach is a growing vision in global Health, which is gaining increasing momentum and recognition by national and international institutions, organizations, stakeholders, NGOs, and health policymakers. The role of world-class universities is pivotal in discovering One Health scientific knowledge and translating them to policy and evidence-based practice. However, while many promote interdisciplinary learning, suggesting ways to make interdisciplinary team science to facilitate positive teamwork outcomes interdisciplinary teamwork is difficult by its very nature (Stokols et al., 2006) . Of course, opposing forces such as those who want to promote department silos voice their outcry at the interdisciplinary movement (Jacobs, 2013) and say that interdisciplinary approaches diminish faculty power and confuse the financial structures of the university. In the end, what Jacobs says \"Interdisciplinarity depends on strong disciplines,\" might be exactly right. In the end, there will probably not be a reorganizing of the university, but new institutes of interdisciplinary studies, such as the one at University of Florida. Such institutes will spring up to herd faculty from various disciplines to come together for special projects and research, all the while maintaining their status quo in their own departments. Therefore, One Health leaders, such as the One Health Commission, need to articulate and strategize better around focused goals (Gibbs, 2014) at universities. Using strategic planning outcomes measures seem to be a better accountability system for global health issues (Fox, 2014) .",
