It is time to look elsewhere for answers and for protocols which might be used in tandem with our diminishing arsenal in order to protect vital drugs. This could bridge the gap before new development in conventional antimicrobial therapy occurs, or might be a longer-term solution, particularly in the area of infectious disease prophylaxis (conventional-sensitive or -resistant). Reliable and safe protocols have been developed for the use of photoantimicrobials in this respect, offering much greater coverage, in terms of the microbial target, than Fleming ever imagined.",

Most scientific reviews and media coverage seem to imply the latter, with the majority of articles/programmes covering the search for replacement antibiotics, such as teixobactin [3] , and only a tiny fraction being dedicated to other methods, usually biological, such as vaccination or the use of bacteriophages [4] . The search for these new replacement agents has the same rationale as that of 70 years earlier, i.e., compounds produced by microorganisms for chemical defence against other microorganisms, only in different areas of the globe, or using alternative culturing methods (e.g., teixobactin). Given that we have been spoiled by the ease with which conventional antimicrobial agents are administered, as well as their general availability, it is unsurprising that maintaining the status quo is so desirable. Antimicrobial stewardship clearly means a departure from this situation, and given support (and cooperation) from all sides, can at least cause some arrest in the development of resistant microbes [5] .",

This may seem to be something of an underachievement, but provided at the right time and employed in the right way, this method may be a life-saver.

Typically, this would be treated with a short course of amoxicillin, which might or might not work, depending on the resistance profile of the (presumed) causative bacteria. Since the antibacterial formulation is orally administered, much of the flora of the alimentary canal will thus be provided with a dose sufficient to kill a fraction of the susceptible population, leaving the resistant cohort unharmed and ready to take over the space thus liberated. This selective pressure obviously increases the resistant population, but the resulting physical spread of 'new' bacteria into areas normally occupied by commensals can also lead to illness due to the toxins they release. An extreme instance of this is Clostridioides difficile-associated diarrhoea, a manifestation of bacterial overgrowth in the colon following extended broad-spectrum antibacterial use [6] . Such an outcome would be unusual following straightforward tonsillitis treatment, but upset stomachs caused by a similar mechanism, particularly in juvenile patients, are not.",

Particularly with cationic photosensitisers, a truly antimicrobial capability in the face of a rapidly elevating resistance crisis is available. Descendants of Fleming's mould broth, such as the 21st -century carbapenems, are now routinely nullified by resistance mechanisms developed as a result of \u03b2-lactam prophylaxis, or other misuse. Not only does cationic methylene blue kill bacteria which expresses carbapenemase capability (of any type), but it may also be used prophylactically against colonisation by such bacteria without promoting resistance development.
