As children having a RV infection were randomized to receive either prednisolone or placebo, prednisolone recipients were censored from the analysis at the time of the initiation of the drug [Jartti et al., 2015]. Because our type assignments based on 5\u2032 NCR were mainly equivalent to those based on VP4/VP2 region, genotyping results were merged and processed as equal for statistical analysis. The normality of the data distribution was tested using Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test. Children infected with non\u2010typeable RV species (n = 17) and RV\u2010B (n = 1) were excluded from the statistical analysis. Children with other respiratory virus than RV caused infection were referred as non\u2010RV. For comparisons of patient characteristics and illness severity variables between RV\u2010A, RV\u2010C, and non\u2010RV infections, one\u2010way analysis of variance (ANOVA) or Kruskall\u2013Wallis test were used for countinous variables and Pearson's chi square test or Fischer exact test (when count <5) were used for categorical variables.

Of the 84 RV positive samples, 75% (63/84) were successfully genotyped using the 5\u2032 NCR specific primers and 40% (34/84) were successfully genotyped with VP4/VP2 specific primers. A total of 33 RV isolates (52%) genotyped by 5\u2032 NCR assay were not amplified with primers targeting VP4/VP2 region. RV\u2010C was the most common species detected in 73% (46/63) of the samples using 5\u2032 NCR specific primers. RV\u2010A isolates were detected in 25% (16/63) and RV\u2010B in 1.6% (1/63) of the samples, respectively. In order to confirm 5\u2032 NCR based sequencing results and to verify RV\u2010C species and type assignments, the sequencing of partial VP4/VP2 was also performed. Of those 34 RV positive samples, 88% (30/34) represented RV\u2010C, 8.8% (3/34) RV\u2010A, and 2.9% (1/34) RV\u2010B. Most of the type assignments (93%) were congruent between the sequences obtained from both 5\u2032NCR and VP4/VP2 region (n = 30). Two sequences matching RV\u2010A101 type inVP4/VP2 region and RV\u2010C23 or RV\u2010C16 types in 5\u2032 NCR suggest either putative recombination or presence of two different RV types in the same sample. Of the 34 isolates genotyped from the VP4/VP2 region, sequencing of 5\u2032 NCR products was unsuccessful from four samples. Altogether, 58% (49/84) of the genotyped clinical isolates were indentified as RV\u2010C, 20% (17/84) as RV\u2010A, and 1.2% (1/84) as RV\u2010B while 20% (17/84) remained non\u2010typeable.

In lower airway illnesses, the RV\u2010A detection rate has varied from 22% to 60% [Miller et al., 2009a; Martin et al., 2015]. Nonetheless, in our study RV\u2010A genotypes were detected in 20% of the first time wheezing children.

In a few samples the PCR product was not specific for RV (false\u2010positive samples). Notably, viral genome copy number was low in most of the non\u2010typeable samples so this might affect the results of repeated PCR amplification (data not shown). It has been shown that sequencing primers targeting VP4/VP2 region are less sensitive than the 5\u2032NCR primers used in the primary diagnostic PCR [Wisdom et al., 2009; Simmonds et al., 2010; Bochkov et al., 2014]. Moreover, the sequencing may have been unsuccessful due to presence of multiple RV strains in the same sample. A low number of viral genomes in the samples may represent an antecedent infection. However, the rate of non\u2010typeable RVs is in agreement with previous studies, in which their prevalence has varied from <2% to 30% when using partial sequencing of 5\u2032 NCR and VP4/VP2 region [Linder et al., 2013; Bochkov et al., 2014; Principi et al., 2015; M\u00fcller et al., 2015].

In contrast to previous studies showing more co\u2010infections in RV\u2010A cases [Miller et al., 2009a; Fawkner\u2010Corbett et al., 2016], we found more of them in RV\u2010C cases, which is in agreement with the study of Bizzintino et al. [2011]. The exact mechanism of higher rates of co\u2010infection associated with RV\u2010A versus RV\u2010C species is currently unknown. Perhaps different viral pathogenesis, for example, lower interferon responses and increased epithelial permeability, in RV\u2010C versus RV\u2010A infection might predispose to co\u2010infections with other viruses and bacteria [Jakiela et al., 2008; Baraldo et al., 2012; Contoli et al., 2015]. Besides, the overall prevalence of RV\u2010C isolates in our study samples could also affect the results of co\u2010infection analysis. Our finding also strengthens the role of respiratory viruses, especially RV, in wheezing illnesses [Jartti et al., 2004; Jackson et al., 2008]. RV is shown to be a strong predictor for recurrent wheezing episodes, and together with allergic sensitization the risk for developing asthma is further increased [Jackson et al., 2008; Jackson et al., 2012; Lukkarinen et al., 2013].",

Our study adds to previous reports that atopy is especially common in young children with first wheezing episode caused by RV\u2010A or RV\u2010C rather than by other respiratory virus infection [Soto\u2010Quiros et al., 2012; Cox et al., 2013; Lukkarinen et al., 2013; Turunen et al., 2014]. Furthermore, our finding may indicate that children who are sensitized to many environmental factors are more prone to be infected by RV\u2010A or RV\u2010C than by other respiratory viruses. Our results also add to previous findings, that blood eosinophilia is associated especially with RV\u2010A or RV\u2010C induced early wheezing [Midulla et al., 2010]. Maternal atopy has been associated with RV induced lower airway illnesses in young children; yet, no association with specific RV species has been found either in a one previous study or in our study [Miller et al., 2011]. However, in a subgroup analysis, hospitalized children with RV\u2010A and RV\u2010C infection were associated with parental and maternal asthma when compared to those with non\u2010RV infection. An earlier study has shown that RV induced wheezing in children is associated with male sex [Turunen et al., 2014]. This finding is supported by our subgroup analysis of hospitalized patients when children with RV\u2010A and RV\u2010C infections were more associated with male sex than those with non\u2010RV infections. This might also indicate that boys are having a more severe illness than girls.",

This adds to the previous findings that rapid onset of RV illness is essentially prevailing in children with RV\u2010A and RV\u2010C induced wheezing [Jartti et al., 2014]. The association with the use of bronchodilator in our study also supports the more severe illness in RV\u2010A and RV\u2010C infected children than in non\u2010RV. On the contrary, our findings are in agreement with three recent studies reported that there is no significant difference in the illness severity between only RV\u2010A and RV\u2010C infected children [M\u00fcller et al., 2015; Fawkner\u2010Corbett et al., 2016]. Furthermore, neither in our study nor in one previous study did co\u2010infection status influence the illness severity; however, the sample size was small in our study [Fawkner\u2010Corbett et al., 2016]. Severe wheezing in association with RV\u2010A and RV\u2010C infections might be explained by impaired antiviral responses and reduced epithelial barrier function [Jakiela et al., 2008; Baraldo et al., 2012; Contoli et al., 2015]. RV has shown to be a strong risk factor for recurrent wheezing regardless of whether being detected alone or with other viruses [Jackson et al., 2008; Hasegawa et al., 2014; Bergroth et al., 2016]. However, the role of RV coinfections causing recurrent wheezing needs further studies.",

However, it is generally known that 5\u2032 NCR primers are more sensitive for RV PCR amplification than primers targeting VP4/VP2 region [Wisdom et al., 2009; Simmonds et al., 2010; Bochkov et al., 2014]. In our study, the genotyping results from the VP4/VP2 region were similar in 93% of samples when compared to those from the 5\u2032 NCR; however, sequences from both regions were obtained only in 30 samples. RV\u2010C was the most common species based on both 5\u2032 NCR and VP4/VP2 region sequencing. RV\u2010C types were also phylogenetically grouped with RV\u2010C isolates derived from GenBank [Simmonds et al., 2010; McIntyre et al., 2013].
