The coronaviruses are classified in four genera based on phylogenetic analysis: alpha-coronaviruses, beta-coronaviruses, gammacoronaviruses, and delta-coronaviruses [7] . Some strains of coronaviruses, HCoV-OC43 [a beta-coronavirus] and HCoV-229E [an alpha-coronavirus], are causative agents of the common cold and rarely severe respiratory disease [8, 9] . Other newly discovered human coronaviruses, HCoV-NL634 and HCoV-HKU1, are occasionally associated with severe lower respiratory tract infection in infants and immunocompromised patients [10, 11] . SARS-CoV is a lineage B betacoronavirus and MERS-CoV is a novel beta-coronavirus of lineage C, and both these viruses appear to have crossed the species barrier from bats to humans [12, 13] . Bats are reservoirs for many mammalian coronaviruses [13] [14] [15] . Various SARS-like coronaviruses have been found in bats from China, Asia, and Europe, but none were considered as direct progenitor of SARS-CoV. Recently, however, investigators from China reported whole genome sequences of two novel bat coronaviruses from Chinese horseshoe bats closely related to SARS-CoV [16] . The receptor-binding domain of the spike protein was very similar to that of SARS-CoV, and one of the isolates [bat SL-CoV-w1V1] uses the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 [ACE2] from humans, civets, and Chinese horseshoe bats for cell entry [16] . SARS-CoV was previously shown to use human ACE2 molecule as its entry receptor, an outstanding feature of its cross-species transmissibility [17] . Thus, the bat SL-CoV-WIVI may be the ancestor virus that precedes the evolution of SARS-CoV in humans.", "cite_spans": [{"start": 178, "end": 181, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 349, "end": 352, "text": "[7]", "ref_id": "BIBREF6"}, {"start": 533, "end": 536, "text": "[8,", "ref_id": "BIBREF7"}, {"start": 537, "end": 539, "text": "9]", "ref_id": "BIBREF8"}, {"start": 728, "end": 732, "text": "[10,", "ref_id": "BIBREF9"}, {"start": 733, "end": 736, "text": "11]", "ref_id": "BIBREF10"}, {"start": 920, "end": 924, "text": "[12,", "ref_id": "BIBREF11"}, {"start": 925, "end": 928, "text": "13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 984, "end": 988, "text": "[13]", "ref_id": "BIBREF12"}, {"start": 989, "end": 993, "text": "[14]", "ref_id": "BIBREF13"}, {"start": 994, "end": 998, "text": "[15]", "ref_id": "BIBREF14"}, {"start": 1309, "end": 1313, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1556, "end": 1560, "text": "[16]", "ref_id": "BIBREF15"}, {"start": 1704, "end": 1708, "text": "[17]", "ref_id": "BIBREF16"}], "ref_spans": [], "section": "Abstract"}, {"text": "The respiratory epithelial cells of humans are the main targets of SARS-CoV, but the virus can also be found in immune cells in the circulation [lymphocytes and macrophages] and in various organs [18] .

A recent study compared the viral replication, cytokine/chemokine response, and antigen presentation in MERS-CoV-infected human monocyte-derived macrophages [MDMs] and SARS-CoVinfected MDMs [23] . Only MERS-CoV and not SARS-CoV could replicate in human macrophages, but both viruses could not stimulate the expression of antiviral cytokines, interferon-alpha [IFN-\u03b1], and IFN-\u03b2. Comparable levels of tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-\u03b1 and interleukin [IL]-6 could be induced by both viruses. However, MERS-CoV induced significantly higher levels of IL-12, IFN-\u00a5, and several chemokines than SARS-CoV [23] . In addition, the expression of major histocompatibility complex [HLA] class 1 and costimulatory molecules were greater in MERS-CoV-infected MDMs than SARS-CoV-infected cells. The establishment of productive infection in macrophages and dendritic cells results in impaired antigenpresenting pathway, and greater aberrant induction of cytokines/chemokines by MERS-CoV could explain the higher severity of infection and greater mortality than SARS-CoV infection [23] .
