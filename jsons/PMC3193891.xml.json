The IPS electronically identifies patients who require isolation by capturing demographic information from the admission/discharge/transfer system and merging it with microbiology data, physicians\u2019 isolation orders from the hospital\u2019s electronic medical record, and isolation information from previous admissions. Rules and logic are applied to monitor the need for isolation precautions; for example, organisms of interest are automatically linked to the correct category of isolation based on Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria and institutional policy. In addition, patients with a previous history of an infection requiring isolation are automatically placed back on the isolation patient list on readmission to the respective institution. Patient-specific clinical information also can be gathered from the system and displayed in a summary format on a single screen.14 The hospital\u2019s infection preventionists confirm the isolation information for patients on the IPS list at least twice daily. When a patient did not have positive microbiologic results suggestive of an infectious process but clinicians nevertheless suspected that the patient had a communicable illness (eg, signs and symptoms of tuberculosis or diarrhea), clinical indications were entered by the infection preventionists into the IPS for monitoring.",

Each phase of the study included a time period for the observer to become comfortable with the study tool. For both phases, the observer followed the same pattern at each hospital site, starting at the top floor and working downward. Rooms that were known or expected to house isolated patients were reviewed, along with any other rooms in which staff had placed isolation signs but had not informed the infection preventionists. Each room was evaluated for the presence of an isolation supply cart or anteroom and for the existence of PPE, including gloves (small, medium, and large sizes), isolation gowns, and, if appropriate, masks and protective eyewear. If HCWs were seen entering or exiting a patient\u2019s room, the observer documented whether they performed hand hygiene and wore PPE on entering the room, removed the PPE on exiting the room, and performed hand hygiene after removing gloves. If the HCW did not remove his or her PPE before leaving the room, the observer noted whether he or she touched the inanimate environment or patient care equipment outside the room. If a group of staff or visitors entered or exited an isolation room, a maximum of 3 people were observed for a total of 6 observations per room. Staff and visitor adherence to isolation precautions were recorded only when they could be observed directly.",

Each day, the observer printed a daily census of patients requiring isolation using the IPS and manually transcribed each patient\u2019s unit, room, and bed information onto the PF. The observer visited each patient\u2019s room listed on the isolation census. These visits were generally made on weekdays during the day or evening shift, although they were occasionally made on weekends. A schedule was developed on a monthly basis by the observer. If the observer found additional patients who had been placed on isolation by the medical team but were not listed on the IPS, then the observer added the room and bed information to the PF and observed those patients as well. If the observer identified inconsistencies between the expected isolation status for a room/bed on the IPS list (eg, an unoccupied room, a missing sign), then a staff member was consulted to confirm the patient\u2019s information. The PF was modified based on changes in patient location, isolation status, or discharge. The observer recorded HCW and visitor compliance with hand hygiene and transmission-based precautions, and noted whether the appropriate PPE was available for each patient. Periodically, the observer transcribed the observations into an Excel (Microsoft, Redmond, WA) database, and these data were rematched to the IPS to merge additional information on visit admission and discharge dates and isolation start and end dates. Mismatches and data entry errors (eg, incorrect medical record number or isolation category) were retrospectively adjusted to ensure that observations were being made on the correct patient.",

The WBF captures the same data elements listed on the PF but provides structured data fields that contain all possible responses, to eliminate variability in recording and to prompt the observer to evaluate PPE and staff compliance appropriate to the specific isolation category. Radio buttons are used to collect binary data elements, check boxes are used for the fields requiring multiple responses, and text fields are used to document notes. A wireless-networked, hospital-approved tablet computer (Lenovo ThinkPad X200, Lenovo, Morrisville, NC); is used to collect data in real time while rounding on the unit. The tablet computer was chosen over a nonnetworked electronic device, such as a palm pilot, because the WBF was available through the hospital\u2019s intranet. Accessing the WBF via the tablet computer also allows for more rapid recording of observations using a direct input method compared with the use of a cursor button or mouse, which is ergonomically challenging.",

Initially, the WBF was defaulted to load all beds within the building being observed.

The observer conducts rounds as in the PF phase, and observations are recorded directly into the database.

The WBF phase required no additional time for data entry, so the time required for each individual observation was used to calculate the mean observation time per room. The time saved per room was calculated by subtracting the mean observation time per room for the WBF from the mean observation time per room for the PF. The total time saved in hours per year was calculated by multiplying the time saved per room by the total number of observations conducted in the 10-month study period dividing by 10 and multiplying by 12 to extrapolate from 10 months to 1 year.",

These factors include mandatory public reporting of HAIs to federal and state agencies, adherence to performance standards associated with Joint Commission patient safety goals, decreases in Medicare reimbursement, and increased public accountability.17\n",

This involves carefully evaluating the advantages and disadvantages of performing surveillance using a PF versus a WBF (Table 1\n). Each method has its advantages and disadvantages. For example, a PF requires extra transcription time and data entry time and has the potential for data loss from misplaced data collection forms or transcription errors from the PF to an electronic database or software package. Moreover, the PF cannot control for user variability in documenting observations, because only free text is allowed. On the other hand, the PF does not require technical expertise, a portable tablet computer, or special software, and it can be easily created and adjusted as needed.
