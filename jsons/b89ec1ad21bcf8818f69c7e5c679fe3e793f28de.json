Mean body mass index was 29.9 kg/m2 (17.8 -38 kg/m2). All patients presented 7 to 10 days after symptom onset except Patient 4 who was transferred into our facility. All patients except one were admitted or transferred to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Average length of ICU stay was 10 days with 5 patients requiring ventilation. A lower subcutaneous dose of tocilizumab was given to 3 patients. Death occurred in 2 patients. Patient 7 underwent cardiac arrest after tocilizumab therapy, making it impossible to interpret the effect of tocilizumab. Clinical improvement was observed in 7 of the remaining 8 patients with either decreasing oxygen requirements or successful extubation. Most patients noted an improvement in inflammatory markers ",

Most patients received one or two doses of tocilizumab within 48 hours of respiratory decompensation. Reports have discussed uncertainty in dosing tocilizumab.[4, 5] Within our patients, some received a lower subcutaneous dose of tocilizumab, suggesting that a lower dose might be enough to manage the CRS. Trials have proposed that a repeated dose of tocilizumab be given to critically ill patients with elevated IL-6 due to the limited response seen with one dose.[4, 5] Within our patients there was no difference between those who received one or two doses and reflects reports of improvement in inflammatory markers and oxygen requirements within 1 week of tocilizumab administration.[4, 5] The timing of administration in relation to disease course remains uncertain. It is unknown if earlier administration of tocilizumab triggered by rising inflammatory markers could prevent or decrease severity of respiratory decompensation.",
