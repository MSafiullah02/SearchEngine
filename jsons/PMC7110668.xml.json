Clinical examination of the individual patient helps to determine which specimens to collect and how to evaluate the specimens, and can suggest the most likely diagnosis. Establishing a specific diagnosis often requires additional diagnostic tests because the clinical signs of many respiratory conditions are similar.",

The eyelids may stick together, and eventually the conjunctival sacs fill with caseous exudate. Similar exudate progresses from serous to caseous in the nasal cavity and infraorbital sinuses, causing distention. Vitamin A deficiency results in squamous metaplasia of mucous membranes and mucous glands, which results in distention of the glands, a condition that then resembles small pustules in the oral cavity and the esophagus. These gross lesions allow differentiation of vitamin A deficiency from infectious causes of sinus swelling and conjunctivitis. Severe deficiency can cause epithelial changes in other systems, including the ureter. Subsequent obstruction of the ureter results in gout secondary to renal failure. Such deficiency usually is associated only with a history of feeding rations consisting mostly of unsupplemented milo, wheat, or corn.15\n",

The type of ration supplied should be appropriate to the species and age of the birds in the flock because nutritional requirements differ among types of birds and change with their maturity. Multiple nutrients are involved with the ability of birds to resist disease and the development of their immune system.67 The method and length of feed storage as well as feeding practices can influence flock health and should be considered under the broad category of nutrition with regard to disease control. Allowing feed to become wet can promote mold growth and potentially lead to aspergillosis or problems associated with mycotoxin production. Feeds stored at high temperatures or for excessively long periods lose significant amounts of vitamin activity.",
