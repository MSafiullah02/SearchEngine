Our understanding of most of these emerging viral infections, including their incidence, clinical manifestations, diagnosis, and management, in the immunocompromised host is limited, and larger, prospective studies in endemic areas are necessary. With the increasing number of transplants, both SOT and HSCT, performed globally, any description of emerging viral infections in this population will require frequent monitoring and updating. For the purposes of this chapter, we performed searches of the medical literature in PubMed, limited to studies reported in English. Searches were performed through May of 2016, using the name of the virus family, genus, or species of interest matched with the search terms \u201ctransplant,\u201d \u201ctransplant*,\u201d and \u201cimmunocompromised.\u201d We also performed general searches for emerging viruses and transplant recipients to identify case reports of novel or rare pathogens causing disease in transplant recipients. Finally, we included pertinent references from the publications identified during our search. With rare exceptions, we excluded reports involving only patients with HIV or AIDS.",

Many viral pathogens do not grow well, or do not grow at all, in cell culture, and viral detection is limited by the range of cells on which a given virus will grow and the number of cell lines a given lab can maintain. Even when cytopathic effect develops in a cell monolayer, the virus has to be identified by other means (often DFA or PCR). The majority of the viruses discussed in this chapter are diagnosed by other means, though agents such as lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) and dengue can be grown in culture as well [13, 14].",

Hence, pathogen detection is limited by the knowledge and judgment of the ordering clinician or the available tests. The increasing use of multiplex testing for clinical syndromes, particularly for respiratory tract infections, will allow for a less biased approach to viral diagnosis but still faces limitations in identifying rare or emerging pathogens [15]. It should be noted that in very rare situations, as in the case of Usutu virus (USUV) discussed below, an unusual or novel pathogen may be detected by testing for known pathogens. In this case, a woman presented with USUV viremia, which gave a low-positive result by WNV PCR and was eventually identified by sequencing [16].",

Despite the aforementioned limitations of viral culture, this technique remains useful, as indicated by the identification of two novel bunyaviruses, Huaiyangshan virus (HYSV , also known as severe fever with thrombocytopenia syndrome virus, SFTSV) in China and Heartland virus [17, 18] A number of more rapid molecular methods are now being employed in viral discovery; however, these are typically categorized as sequence-dependent (such as the pan-viral microarray or PCR based on conserved sequences) or sequence-independent techniques [19]. The pan-viral microarray (Virochip) is an array spotted with oligonucleotide sequences representing all known viral pathogens. Novel viruses can also be identified if there is sufficient similarity between sequences in the new virus and those included on the array. Amplicons can be then be recovered from the array, cloned, and sequenced [20]. This technology has been used in the identification of the SARS coronavirus, XMRV, and was also tested as a means to rapidly identify the 2009 pandemic influenza strain (H1N1) [19, 21]. PCR based on conserved sequences is possible but generally has limited applicability in viral diagnostics, as viruses do not contain highly conserved sequences analogous to the 16s ribosomal sequences utilized in bacterial identification [22]. One example of this is the performance of PCR using primer sets that amplify members of a virus family followed by sequencing, as reported in the identification of USUV from patient samples using a pan-flavivirus RT-PCR [16, 23].",

Sequence-independent approaches include subtractive hybridization or representation difference analysis (RDA), sequence-independent single\u2013primer amplification (SISPA), rolling circle amplification, and next-generation sequencing. Subtractive hybridization or representational difference analysis (RDA) uses infected and uninfected samples from an individual patient. Viral nucleic acid is selectively concentrated by repeated rounds of hybridization and purification of the un-hybridized, single-stranded nucleic acid molecules, which are then subcloned and sequenced. These techniques have been used in the identification of human herpes virus 8 (HHV-8) and the torque teno viruses (TTV), but they require large amounts of starting material as well as relatively high virus levels [19, 22, 25]. SISPA circumvents the need for large amounts of viral genomic material. This technique, introduced in 1991, and its derivations involve the attachment of a linker/primer to blunt-ended nucleic acid and the subsequent amplification of all nucleic acid present, followed by cDNA library creation and sequencing [26]. SISPA was utilized in the identification of HEV, Norwalk virus, and Parvovirus 4 [22, 27]. Rolling circle amplification involves the use of the PhiX29 polymerase primed with random primers to amplify circular viral genomes or cloned fragments. It was used in the identification of human bocavirus (HBoV) among others [19, 28].",

Termed \u201cnext-generation sequencing\u201d or \u201c deep-sequencing,\u201d such technologies allow for the rapid and parallel generation of one million to over one billion sequences per run. Most of the current technologies rely on the non-specific amplification of DNA or RNA molecules followed by sequencing by synthesis using different technologies to detect base incorporation [22, 24, 29, 30]. Recently, single-molecule sequencing has become available, and this technology continues to develop, resulting in a greater number of reads (i.e., deeper sequencing) and longer read lengths [30]. These technologies are able to detect viral copy numbers near the limit of detection for specific quantitative PCR assays and have been shown to be more sensitive than microarray analysis (2 per 106 versus 1 per 105 sequences in one study) [31, 32]. Next-generation sequencing has been utilized to identify novel viruses in patient samples (see arenaviruses below) and determine the cause of fevers of unknown origin [32\u201335]. The potential utility of direct sequencing in the outbreak setting has also been shown following the 2009 influenza pandemic [21].",

Sequencing reactions take a good deal of time to set up and perform, with run times between 12 h and 14 days [29]. These runs also generate massive amounts of data that must be filtered to remove human and low-complexity sequence prior to analysis using various alignment programs designed to handle the large numbers of short reads [29, 32]. Finally, results must be interpreted carefully, as contaminants from the laboratory and even from commercial reagents, such as Moloney murine leukemia virus (MMLV , from polymerase preparations), are often identified [21, 32]. Confirming the presence of a virus identified with small numbers of sequences can also be difficult. In the study of metagenomics following the 2009 influenza pandemic, one patient from British Columbia was found to have two sequences matching an Ebola Sudan isolate, and during the evaluation of children in Nicaragua with fevers of unknown origin, a child had sequence similar to African swine fever virus [21, 32]. Run-time and data management and analysis will need to be streamlined before such technology will be applicable for relatively routine use in a clinical laboratory.",

Most of the millions who are affected acquired their infections vertically via breast milk, but this retrovirus may also be transmitted by blood transfusion, sharing of needles, and organ transplantation. A number of complications are associated with chronic HTLV-1 infection, most frequently adult T-cell leukemia (ATL) and HTLV-associated myelopathy (HAM), which occur in 5% or fewer of those infected. Immunosuppression administered to transplant recipients who are HTLV-1 carriers may trigger progression to these known complications of the infection (for a brief summary, see Table 45.1) [38\u201340]. Numerous reports document the devastating clinical impact of ATL and HAM from HTLV-1 infection in solid organ transplant recipients [38, 41, 42]. The majority of these cases are from Spain and Japan, though additional reports in the United States have surfaced in recent years involving donors and recipients with expected epidemiologic risk factors (i.e., residence in endemic regions) [43, 44].",

In a nationwide survey in Japan, Yoshizumi et al. identified 82 living donor liver transplant recipients who were HTLV-1 positive prior to transplantation. ATL developed in 5 of these 26 (15.4%) after intervals of 181\u20131315 days after transplantation. All five died, four due to ATL and one due to rejection after reduction in immunosuppressive therapy. In a compelling case series of donor-derived HTLV-1 infection, liver and two kidney recipients from HTLV-1 seropositive donor were acutely infected with HTLV-1 with rapid dissemination early in the posttransplant period. HTLV-1 provirus was detected by PCR on days 16\u201323 and increased by 2\u20133 logs by day 38\u201345, after which steady state was reached. HTLV-1 antibodies were first detected between 16 and 39 days following transplantation. Alignment of the HTLV-1 5\u2032 LTR of the donor and the three recipients showed 100% sequence identity consistent with a common viral source of infection. Though no cases of early onset or rapid progression of HAM were observed in this series, in another case series, all three HLTV-1-negative recipients of organs from a single HTLV-1 -positive donor (two kidney transplants and a liver transplant) developed antibodies to the retrovirus and developed HAM within the 2 years of transplantation. HTLV-1 isolates from these three recipients were homologous to the donor isolate by DNA sequencing [45, 46]. Two case reports also document the occurrence of HAM in a heart transplant recipient and an HSCT recipient who both acquired HTLV-1 through blood transfusions [39, 47].",

No patient developed ATL or HAM during follow-up of approximately 5 years, although one patient died of aspiration pneumonia 17 days after transplantation [48].

In regions with low rates of infection, screening of all donors generates many false positives, resulting in delays in transplantation or the loss of potential organs for donation. Following the three cases of donor-derived HTLV-1 infection in Spain, 2870 potential organ donors and recipients were screened for antibodies to HTLV-1, including 1079 immigrants. Only five patients tested positive (confirmed by Western blot), and all of them were immigrants from South America or Africa [52]. The practice of universal HTLV-1 screening is no longer recommended by the United States Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) [37, 53]. However, targeted screening for HTLV-1/2 seropositivity by organ procurement organizations (OPO) may be encouraged in high-risk living and deceased donors based on local prevalence data [43, 54].",

Near relatives are the preferred sources of stem cells for transplantation, but in endemic areas, such individuals are also frequently infected with this retrovirus. The largest study addressing this question involved a retrospective analysis of data from three centers in Japan. In this study, 386 patients with ATL underwent allogeneic HSCT with a 3-year survival rate of 33%. Unfortunately, those who received their transplant from a related HTLV-1-positive donor had a higher risk of disease-associated mortality relative to those whose related donor was HTLV-1 negative. HSCT recipients in complete remission at the time of transplantation had a higher rate of survival compared to patients not in complete remission (51% versus 26%). These results likely account for the finding that patients who received an HSCT from matched unrelated donors did as well as those from matched related donors (3-year survival, 39% versus 41%) [55]. No proven effective therapy for HAM exists. Some experts suggest antiviral prophylaxis with zidovudine and raltegravir, but antiviral therapy drugs are generally believed to have little effect on HTLV-1 because it is a cell-associated virus and proviral load is predominantly maintained by cell division of infected cells rather than free viral replication. Furthermore, definitive long-term benefits of interferon and corticosteroids have yet to be established [43].",

All of these viruses except for Lagos bat virus have resulted in fatal human disease, but at this time, only rabies has been reported in the transplant population [56]. Rabies virus is typically acquired in humans through the bite of an infected animal. It is estimated that over 55,000 cases occur annually, worldwide, and most result from the bite of an infected dog [56, 57]. In countries where canine vaccination is routine, bites from insectivorous bats have emerged as the most common source [57]. Rabies infection results in an encephalitis that is nearly universally\nfatal unless the patient has been vaccinated or receives postexposure prophylaxis (PEP). Limited data suggest that some individuals can survive rabies exposure without intervention, including a single case in the United States and serologic data from humans in the Peruvian Amazon, but these cases appear to be rare [58, 59].",

Six patients were potentially exposed to rabies virus following the death of a 26-year-old woman, who died after presenting with altered mental status\n. She had reportedly consumed cocaine, amphetamines, and MDMA before her admission, developed cerebral edema, and was declared brain dead. During a contact investigation after the report of cases, it was discovered that she had been bitten by a dog on a recent trip to India. PEP was administered to all six transplant recipients (lung, liver, kidney, kidney-pancreas, and both corneas), though not until at least 45 days after transplantation. The recipients of lung, kidney, and kidney-pancreas transplants died of rabies. Antiviral treatment was administered (with ribavirin and interferon) in these three cases as well as in the case of the liver transplant recipient. The lung recipient died on posttransplantation day 49 despite the initiation of deep\nsedation with ketamine and midazolam. The kidney transplant recipient died on day 52 despite the addition of amantadine but not deep sedation. The kidney-pancreas recipient was also treated with deep sedation starting with midazolam followed by ketamine and phenobarbital. Brain death was declared after 9 weeks and supportive measures discontinued. The liver transplant recipient had been vaccinated against rabies over 20 years before transplantation and never developed disease [71, 72]. Both corneal grafts were explanted\n, but rabies virus was not detected in either cornea by RT-PCR. It has been suggested that the lack of rabies in these corneal grafts was the result of the limited excision procedure performed such as subcorneal complex excision rather than enucleation and the prolonged storage of the grafts prior to transplant for 5 days [72, 73].",

Three individuals have apparently recovered from rabies (diagnosed by antibody testing) without receiving either intervention. These have all been young women (aged 8, 15, and 17), and two patients received treatment with what is now called the Milwaukee protocol (named after Milwaukee, WI), which includes a prolonged therapeutic coma, antiviral therapy, management of vasospasm, and avoidance\nof prophylaxis [58, 76, 77]. To date, 30 patients have received the Milwaukee protocol, but only one other patient has survived to hospital discharge [78, 79]. This patient had received partial PEP, however [78]. In two reports (one case report and a case series of eight patients), transplant recipients who received rabies PEP appeared to mount an adequate response (antibody titers of 0.5 IU/mL), though titers were lower than those seen in immunocompetent patients [80\u201382]. Rodriguez-Romo et al. reported the case of a kidney transplant\nrecipient who received two courses of PEP after being bitten by a rabid dog. Following the first course, adequate antibody titers\ndeveloped but then declined. A second PEP course was administered along with a reduction in immunosuppression; he maintained an adequate antibody level and remained asymptomatic [81]. Taken together, these data indicate that rabies vaccination can be effective, even after transplantation, and PEP may be safe and effective in transplant recipients.",

In the largest recorded outbreak, 181 cases were documented in the United States associated with pet hamsters. While 46 patients were hospitalized, no one died [83\u201385].",

Symptoms developed between 2 and 23 days posttransplant and included fever, abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, and altered mental status occasionally accompanied by seizures. A number of patients also developed a peri-incisional rash and tenderness. Laboratory findings included increased transaminases and creatinine. Both leucopenia and leukocytosis occurred. CSF findings included elevated protein (often marked), normal to low glucose, and a mild pleocytosis. The diagnosis of LCMV was confirmed in all patients using IHC on tissue samples or RT-PCR on tissue and serum samples. Serology was performed less frequently and was often negative. Bronchopneumonia or diffuse alveolar damage and hepatic inflammation or necrosis were the most common findings at autopsy [13, 86, 87, 89].",

No definitive evidence of rodent exposure was discovered for the 2013 donor, although he had spent substantial time outside along the Mississippi River. Three of the donors also had positive LCMV testing: detectable IgM and IgG in archived serum from the day before death (2008 donor), a positive RT-PCR from a single lymph node (2011 donor), and a positive RT-PCR from aortic endothelial cells (2013 donor) [86\u201388]. Investigation into the 2003 donor revealed no clear exposure history and serology, viral culture, and IHC performed on other tissues collected at the time of donation were all negative [13, 91]. Likewise, all diagnostic testing (including RT-PCR) performed on stored samples from the 2005 donor was negative, and all further testing performed on samples from the 2011 donor was negative (including other lymph nodes) [13, 87].

The establishment of HBoV as a pathogen, however, has been complicated by the high rates of detection of co-pathogens along with HBoV (up to 90%), detection of the virus in asymptomatic patients (43% in one study from Canada), and significant difference in the study design of published reports, including different methods of sample collection (NP swab, NP aspirate, or bronchoalveolar lavage) and the extent to which other pathogens were excluded [36, 97, 100]. It does appear that HBoV causes a subset of respiratory tract infections, particularly among infants and young children (<2 years of age), and the use of quantitative PCR may be a means to identify these patients. A 5.7% prevalence of HBoV has been reported from testing over 1800 NP swabs from healthy children presenting with a respiratory illness over a 3-year period [103]. In a separate study by Allander et al., patients with high HBoV viral loads (>104 copies/mL) in NP aspirates were more likely to have an isolated HBoV infection (though 18 of 28 patients still had another pathogen detected) and often had concomitant viremia detectable by PCR [95]. One study also reported an association between high HBoV viral loads in NP aspirates with longer duration of hospitalization in healthy pediatric children presenting with a respiratory illness [103]. The detection of HBoV in the blood is not necessarily surprising as other parvoviruses (B19 and PARV4) are also detected in this compartment. HBoV DNA has also been detected from stool, though its potential as a gastrointestinal pathogen is unclear [102].",

The patient was a 4-year-old boy who underwent HSCT and had a complicated hospital course including persistent fevers, which improved but did not completely resolve upon neutrophil engraftment, a lower respiratory tract infection, and diarrhea. HBoV was detected repeatedly from NP aspirates, serum, and stool, though its role in this case is complicated by the co-detection of rhinovirus from an NP aspirate, CMV reactivation, and grade I GVHD of the skin (no mention of path from the GI tract) [104]. In 2011, the same group reported on three more cases of immunocompromised patients (along with the case from 2007) with repeatedly positive tests for HBoV. These patients had virus detectable after weeks of isolation, often during the summer months, which supports the hypothesis that HBoV may establish latency and reactivate in the setting of a coinfection or impaired immunity [105]. Severe diarrhea was also reported in a 9-year-old transplant recipient (both liver and HSCT) associated with detectable HBoV in plasma and stool [106]. Other studies evaluating the role of HBoV as a respiratory pathogen in immunocompromised adults have detected the virus at low levels (or not at all) and have not documented a difference in outcomes between immunocompromised patients and immunocompetent controls [107\u2013109].",

If this virus establishes latency, most transplant recipients will be at risk to develop reactivation, but whether that results in disease or is simply a marker of severe immune suppression has yet to be determined. The reporting of HBoV will no doubt increase. There are a number of published PCR assays to use for detection, and at least one platform for multiplex respiratory pathogen detection includes HBoV in a panel of 21 agents [36, 111].

EV-D68 was first identified in 1962 in four children suffering from pneumonia and bronchiolitis and, prior to 2014, detected in only a small number of patients [116]. The 2014 outbreak began concurrently in Kansas City, MO, and Chicago, IL, where an increase in hospitalizations for severe respiratory illness was noted in pediatric patients. Multiplex PCR assays detected an increase in rhinovirus/enterovirus in nasopharyngeal specimens. Evaluation by the CDC found 19 of 22 specimens from Kansas City and 11 of 14 specimens from Chicago positive for EV-D68\n. Of these 30 patients, 29 (96.7%) were admitted to the ICU and 6 (20.0%) required mechanical ventilation [117]. By the end of 2014, over 1100 cases of respiratory illness caused by EV-D68 had been reported in the United States, predominantly among children. Subsequently, more than 2000 cases of respiratory illness were attributed to EV-D68 in 20 countries worldwide [118, 119].",

Factors that predispose to milder disease are incompletely understood, though several studies report asthma as a risk factor for ICU admission and need for mechanical ventilation [118, 120]. Concurrent with the respiratory outbreak, clusters of children with acute flaccid paralysis and severe neurologic disease were observed in the United States and Europe and attributed to EV-D68 given the temporal relationship of symptoms and detection of the virus in pharyngeal swabs [121]. EV-D68 has since been linked with acute paralytic poliomyelitis, encephalitis, myelitis, encephalomyelitis, or acute transverse myelitis [119]. As no specific vaccine or antiviral for EV-D68 exists, treatment of children with EV-D68 is mainly supportive and focused on symptom relief for fever and respiratory support if needed.",

Eight cases of EV-D68 in hematologic malignancy or HSCT recipients were found in one study, which retrospectively tested for the presence of the virus in respiratory samples (n = 506) that had tested positive for human rhinovirus (HRV) or negative for all respiratory viruses in a multiplex panel collected over a 3-month period. Thirteen (11.5%) cases originally identified as HRV were subsequently characterized as EV-D68 with a specific PCR assay, highlighting the limited specificity of HRV primers and the potential for inaccurate diagnosis. Furthermore, of the 393 cases initially negative for all respiratory viruses, 8 (2%) were presumptive EV-D68. This has implications for infection control as patients with negative tests results would likely be removed from droplet isolation and theoretically could result in person-to-person transmission particularly among immunocompromised patients. The eight cases of EVD-68 in hematologic malignancy or HSCT recipients (51\u20131833 days from transplant) developed symptoms ranging from mild upper respiratory tract infection to respiratory failure [122]. Cases were not limited to children, as all were in immunocompromised adults aged 22\u201369 years old. At this time, cases of EV-D68 in solid organ transplants have yet to be reported in the literature.",

The most significant manifestation of measles in this patient population is subacute measles encephalitis (SME , also reported as immunosuppressive measles encephalitis or measles inclusion body encephalitis), but severe cases of pneumonia and one case of liver transplant rejection possibly resulting from measles have also been reported (Table 45.1) [127, 129, 130, 136\u2013142]. SME was originally documented in patients immunocompromised from chemotherapy or malignancy, and the disease was first reported in a renal transplant recipient in 1979 [127]. It has since been reported in other renal transplant recipients, though not always confirmed by IHC staining or RT-PCR, and a single patient following HSCT [129, 136, 141, 143]. Patients with SME\nmay initially present with an illness compatible with measles, including fever, conjunctivitis, and a rash, though this is not consistent and typically is only recognized as measles in retrospect [127, 136, 139, 141]. Patients typically improve but then re-present with altered mental status and seizures between 2 weeks and 4 months after their initial illness. In a review of the literature, the range was 1\u20137 months, but this included predominantly nontransplant patients [129, 136, 139, 141]. At the time of admission for seizures, fevers are particularly uncommon, and CT imaging and CSF analysis are often normal. The first imaging changes are seen by MRI with increased signal intensity on FLAIR. The clinical course is one of deteriorating mental status and worsening seizures refractory to anti-epileptic drugs [127, 129, 136, 139]. Four of six transplant cases of SME\ndied. The two survivors were reported in 2006 by Turner et al. Both cases occurred in pediatric renal transplant recipients, 6 and 11 years out from transplant. They both received one dose of IVIG and a course of IV ribavirin. Both of them survived, though both had significant neurological deficits [141]. A single case of SME occurred in a previously healthy boy following MMR vaccination, though during admission, he was found to have a primary immune deficiency [144].",

In an attempt to answer this question, Machado et al. evaluated 156 HSCT recipients during the 1997 outbreak of measles in Sao Paolo. These investigators identified eight cases among 54 patients deemed to be susceptible (based on an IgG \u2264 100 mIU/mL), and notably, only one of them had severe disease, manifested as interstitial pneumonia. All eight patients survived [138]. It has been noted that the case definition, requiring a serological response (appearance of IgM or rise in IgG), may be too restrictive for HSCT\nrecipients, resulting in a number of missed cases [145]. A second, short report by Lee et al. documented a fatal case of pneumonia in an HSCT recipient clinically diagnosed with measles during an outbreak in Korea from 2000 to 2001. At their center, they presumptively diagnosed 16 HSCT recipients with measles (methods not specified), with this as the only case of severe disease. The patient who died of pneumonia never developed detectable IgM or IgG [137]. The incidence of measles in SOT\nand HSCT recipients remains unclear, though given the 222 cases of measles in the United States and tens of thousands of cases in Europe in 2011, it is likely under reported [128, 131].",

Two patients showed involvement of their graft: one in a patient with a failed graft already on dialysis and the second with a previously functioning graft who developed tubulointerstitial nephritis and permanent graft failure. This second patient also developed orchitis and vestibular neuronitis with persistent vertigo after recovery. All three patients survived [123, 146, 147]. Both cases in the HSCT literature document fatal encephalitis in young patients with severe combined immunodeficiency treated with HSCT. The first patient was a 16-month-old infant who developed meningoencephalitis and seizures prior to HSCT and deteriorated rapidly after transplant. Mumps\nwas isolated in culture from urine, blood, and CSF. The infant had been vaccinated for mumps\nseveral months prior, and the authors suggest the vaccine strain as the potential cause of infection [124]. The second patient was a 19-year-old who developed subacute encephalomyelitis from a wild-type mumps strain 2 years after HSCT. Infection occurred during an outbreak of mumps in England and Wales in 2004 and 2005 [148].",

Hendra has been transmitted from horses to their handlers, and nipah has been transmitted from pigs and bats to humans [152, 154]. Human-to-human spread of nipah has also been documented in recent outbreaks [154\u2013156]. Infection resulting from either virus can result in severe respiratory tract disease, encephalitis, or both. In a series of 92 cases of encephalitis from Bangladesh, 69% of patients also had respiratory difficulty, though this rate was higher than that seen in a series from Malaysia (21%) [157, 158]. Mortality from encephalitis has ranged from 30% to 70% in different series, and residual neurological deficits can persist in survivors [157, 158]. An unusual feature of infection with either of these viruses is the occurrence of relapsing or late-onset encephalitis that has been documented to occur up to 22 months after initial presentation and still carries a high mortality [159]. Treatment remains supportive. In the large series reported to date, which involve nipah virus, there have not been documented cases involving transplant recipients or immunocompromised hosts, though the comorbid\nillnesses of patients included in these series\nhave not been fully described [157, 158].",

Orf lesions, also known as ecthyma contagiosum, also occur in humans. These lesions tend to be solitary and occur on the extremities of individuals who work with infected sheep. In the immunocompetent patient, these lesions are self-limited and tend to heal over 1\u20132 months [160, 161]. In transplant and immunocompromised patients, however, a number of cases of recurrent and giant orf lesions have been reported (Table 45.1) [160\u2013164]. These lesions can be 5 cm or more in diameter and have been confined to the hand or forearm. All patients reported contact with sheep. Patients have undergone excision with skin grafting or even amputation when these lesions are not diagnosed correctly, but even with such aggressive treatment, lesions tend to recur after a few weeks to months [160, 162\u2013164]. A single patient also developed a new lesion at the skin-graft donor site [164]. While no standard treatment exists, three case-reports document responses in renal transplant patients using cryotherapy, cidofovir cream, or imiquimod (a single case for each treatment) [161, 163, 164]. The patients treated with cryotherapy and cidofovir required a second course of treatment but again responded well [161, 163].",

Though fatal cases of monkeypox in Africa are well described, no fatalities were reported among these 37 patients [167\u2013169]. Nine patients were described as having severe disease, including a single case each of encephalitis and respiratory distress, and five patients were hospitalized.

A dense inflammatory infiltrate composed of lymphocytes, histiocytes, and focal eosinophils extending into the subcutaneous adipose tissue was consistently demonstrated on multiple specimens. Culture on human epithelial type 2 cells and BSC40 cells demonstrated viral cytopathic effects, but could not be further identified with standard evaluation. Viral DNA was then sequenced by next-generation sequencing. De novo assembly of the viral genome and phylogenetic analysis revealed a novel poxvirus most closely related to Yoka poxvirus, which was isolated from mosquitoes in the Central African Republic in 1972 during an ecologic survey. The patient had no travel outside of his community in upper New York state. The epidemiology of this novel pox virus is not known at this time; however this case serves as reminder that immunocompromised patients are prone to novel infectious diseases [170].",

All have the potential to cause a range of clinical illness, from asymptomatic infection to classical dengue fever (DF) to severe dengue, including dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS). Infection with one serotype (primary infection) results in immunity to that serotype, but infection can occur with any of the remaining serotypes (secondary infection) [173]. Secondary infection has been shown to be a significant risk factor for the development of severe dengue, and this appears to result from both disadvantageous humoral and cellular immune responses (termed antibody-dependent enhancement and original antigenic sin, respectively) [174, 175]. Other factors are also important, such as the order of infection as well as the specific DENV strain [176, 177].",

The six patients in Singapore were identified on presentation to the hospital. Though all survived, the mean platelet count was 80,000 and 5 patients developed leucopenia. There were no cases of DHF or DSS [182]. All 33 patients in these 2 series had stable graft function.",

In one small study, 19 SOT recipients received the YFV vaccine inadvertently during outbreaks in Brazil. No severe AEs were reported, and the mean posttransplant time at vaccination was over 5 years [192]. Similarly, a patient with AML who started chemotherapy just 7 days after receiving YFV vaccination did not develop AEs despite detection of the 17D attenuated viral strain by RT-PCR in plasma samples for 15 days after vaccination. Interestingly, protective neutralizing antibodies were detected 1 month after the vaccine, indicating that memory B lymphocytes may have been preserved despite ablative bone marrow suppression [193].",

In 2004, Chikungunya virus (CHIKV) re-emerged in Kenya and spread to countries around the Indian Ocean, including Reunion, a French overseas district, and India, resulting in millions of cases [194, 195]. Autochthonous spread was even detected in Italy in 2007 [196]. Symptomatic CHIKV infections result in a severe arthritis, which can persist for months following resolution of the fever and rash [197, 198]. Cases of meningoencephalitis and fatalities have been reported [199, 200]. Two cases of severe CHIKV infections in immunocompromised patients were reported by Kee et al., in 2010, including one patient taking an herbal medicine felt to contain steroids and a liver transplant recipient (Table 45.2). The liver transplant recipient presented with fever, headache, and abdominal complaints. IgM was positive for CHIKV, but IgG and serum RT-PCR remained negative (lumbar puncture was not performed). He recovered fully. Neither patient developed arthritis or arthralgias during the course of their infections [201]. A subsequent case of CHIKV infection in an HIV-infected kidney transplant recipient who had traveled to the Dominican Republic 4 years of transplantation reported an episode of arthritis lasting 2 months, which ultimately self-resolved [202]. In a second study, investigators tested corneal grafts from patients living in La Reunion during the 2005\u20132006 CHIKV outbreak. Twelve of 69 asymptomatic, potential donors were found to be viremic (3 patients) or IgM positive (11 patients, including 2 patients with viremia), and corneal grafts from 4 of these patients (all 3 viremic patients) had detectable CHIKV RNA on RT-PCR. While no cases of transplant-associated CHIKV transmission have been documented, researchers did show that transmission can occur by the ocular route in mice [203].",

RVFV is an important livestock pathogen in Africa and causes outbreaks of severe human disease, often following periods of heavy rain. Many human infections are asymptomatic or result in a self-limited febrile illness, though cases of encephalitis and hemorrhagic fever are reported. Disease severity tends to be greater during large outbreaks, and mortality rates of up to 30% in symptomatic patients have been seen. Recently, this infection was seen for the first time in countries outside of Africa, causing outbreaks in Saudi Arabia and Yemen [204, 205].

Heartland virus has been isolated from two patients in Missouri, United States, who were admitted with fevers, diarrhea, and thrombocytopenia. They both improved with supportive care [18]. Both of these viruses were initially isolated in cell culture before being further characterized by electron microscopy and sequencing, and they appear to be closely related members of the genus Phlebovirus [17, 18].

Three cases of hantavirus infection in immunocompromised patients, including a single case in a renal transplant recipient, have been reported (Table 45.2\n) [207\u2013209]. All of these cases involved Old World hantaviruses that are associated with HFRS including Dobrava-Belgrade virus, one case, and Puumala virus, two cases. The renal transplant recipient, 18 months after transplantation, presented with 5 days of fevers, headache, and arthralgia. He developed oliguric renal failure and required 5 days of dialysis prior to return of normal urine output. He was treated with steroids for acute rejection, but given his presentation, he was also evaluated for other causes. IgM returned positive for Dobrava-Belgrade virus, and the patient made a full recovery [207]. The two cases of Puumala virus infection involved a patient with acute leukemia and one receiving anti-TNF therapy. Both patients did well, though interestingly, the patient with leukemia was felt to be infected through a platelet transfusion [208, 209]. The treatment of hantavirus infections remains largely supportive. There is limited data for the use of ribavirin, which decreased mortality in a study of HFRS in China, reported in 1991 [210]. A trial of ribavirin in HPS was terminated early due to slow patient accrual. This study showed no improvement in the patients given ribavirin, though it was underpowered [211]. No benefit was seen in the use of oral prednisone in HFRS [212].",

These include the porcine herpesviruses, porcine CMV (PCMV) and porcine lymphotropic herpesvirus (PLHV); HEV, particularly genotypes 3 and 4; and certain parvoviruses [218]. Many of these viral agents can be excluded from herds by careful breeding practices and frequent herd monitoring. A single study of islet cell transplant to human recipients did not detect PCMV or PLHV, which were also not detected in the herds prior to transplantation [225]. In the pig-to-baboon model of SOT, PCMV DNA was detected in two recipients and PLHV DNA was detected in six (of ten baboons). RNA was not detected for either of these viruses, supporting the conclusion that these were not productive infections. The outcome of these infections remains unclear, however, as the longest surviving recipient after transplantation was only 179 days [223].",

The examples of HTLV-1 and LCMV are illustrative of some of the difficulties involved with donor screening. In low-prevalence settings, HTLV-1 testing generates a large number of false-positive tests, and confirmatory testing can delay transplantation [37, 53]. Hence, this is no longer required by the US OPTN [37, 53]. In the outbreak investigations for LCMV, only one of four donors had detectable antibodies. Indeed, RT-PCR from multiple samples failed to detect LCMV from one donor and yielded a positive result in a single lymph node (but not other samples) in another [13, 86, 87]. It seems prudent to obtain a comprehensive history of potential organ donors, including all recent exposures and travel, though it remains unclear how certain findings, such as rodent ownership, should affect one\u2019s status as an organ donor.",
