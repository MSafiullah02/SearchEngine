It is urgent to analyze the real situation and follow-up trend of the epidemic in the United States. The proposed model divides the time period into two different phases, before and after March 21, 2020. The results show that the basic reproduction number in the early period of propagation in the United States is estimated to be 4.06 (95% CI: 1.86 -6.73) based on the confirmed cases data ranging from January 21, 2020 to March 21, 2020. The normalized contributions to R0 for three different categories of communicators were estimated, including the numbers of the latent population (in incubation period) L, the documented infectious population I d , and the undocumented infectious population I u . The results show that L contributes 16.17% (95% CI: 12.86% -21.60%) to R0, I d contributes 55.13% (95% CI: 43.15% -63.97%), and I u contributes 28.70% (95% CI: 19.29% -40.07%) to R0. The metapopulation network was used to simulate the true spread of COVID-19 in the United States, and the Bayesian inference was applied to estimate the key parameters including the rate of the number of the susceptibles and the infected , the infection ratio between undocumented and documented transmission , the infection ratio between latent and documented transmission , the proportion of confirmed cases in the infectious population",

The infectivity of undocumented infectious population was 0.59 (95% CI: 0.21 -0.70) of that of the documented infectious population, while that of the latent population was 0.19 (95% CI: 0.11 -0.27) of that of the documented infectious population. The incubation period of COVID-19 was estimated to be 10.69 days (95% CI: 10.02 -11.74). We estimated that if the current control interventions are continued, the pandemic situation in the United States is likely to keep climbing up, and the cumulative number of confirmed cases is expected to reach more than 1.7 million in July and continue to grow. We also performed component analysis and sensitivity analysis, researching the compositions of the people with COVID-19, and considering that there is only a random time delay between the number of patients in the incubation period and the actual number of patients.",

As of May 5th, 2020, according to Johns Hopkins University there were 3,661,970 reported cases in 186 countries and regions [3] . With the outbreak of covid-19, different countries or regions have taken different response measures, but the number of infected people has been increasing dramatically.

Because the population and economic situation of each state in the US are different, the epidemic situation of each state, its response measures and effects are also different.

Any person in a population will inevitably be in one of the following six states: the susceptibles (S), the latent (L, People who have already carried the virus but have not shown obvious symptoms), the documented communicators (I d ), the undocumented communicators (I u ), the confirmed cases (C), the recovered or dead (Out), which can be seen in Table 1 for more details.

In order to further analyze the causes of early transmission in the United States, the normalized contributions to R0 for three different categories of communicators were estimated, including L, I d , I u . The results showed that class L contributes 16.17% (95% CI: 12.86% -21.60%) to R0, I d contributes 55.13% (95% CI: 43.15% -63.97%) and I u contributes 28.70% (95% CI: 19.29% -40.07%) to R0. It should be noted that the contribution to R0 does not represent the contribution to the future pandemic spreading trend. Although the infection rate of latent period communicators is lower than that of symptomatic communicators, it still has the possibility to cause large-scale outbreak of COVID-19, which is analyzed in detail in section 4.3. Due to the fact that the documented infectious people are bound to be confirmed, most of the cases untill March 21, 2020 are infected by the confirmed cases, while 28.6% on average of the patients was infected by the undocumented infectious people, which reflects the importance to limit social distance and local contact on a large scale.",
