Currently, ESCs with such properties have only been derived from the mouse and rat [1]. Mouse ESCs were established from the inner cell mass of mouse embryos in the year 1981 [3], [4]. They can differentiate into multiple tissue cells [5] or form chimeric mice [6]. Rat ESCs were successfully isolated and propagated in the presence of small molecules in the year 2008 [7]. The derived rat ESCs also contribute to germline chimeric rats [7], [8].",

Induced pluripotent stem cell technology has been widely used to create disease models and to generate individual-specific hiPSCs that can differentiate into various cell types [27], [28], [29]. For livestock, iPSCs can be used to create gene-modified animals through nuclear transfer or generating chimeras. Gene targeting has been successfully performed with both miPSCs [28] and hiPSCs [30]. Chimeras of miPSCs [31] and rat-induced pluripotent stem cells (riPSCs) [14] were also generated successfully. As a result, iPSCs are a good substitute for both ESCs and somatic cells for researches and applications in other mammalian species [32].",

DNA mismatch repair systems, microsatellite instability, and antioxidant activity may be associated with bat longevity at the molecular level [36]. Sequencing analysis of the bat Myotis brandtii genome and transcriptome discovered that altered growth hormone/insulin-like growth factor-1 axis may have effect on longevity [37].",

Because PCR is a more sensitive method than the Southern blot, we further performed PCR validation (Fig. 2D, right). The clones that were seemingly \u201ctransgene-free\u201d (Nos. 1, 3, 6, and 7) turned out to be positive for exogenous genes, suggesting that exogenous sequences were required for the biPSCs to maintain an undifferentiated state, and that future work would be needed to obtain completely transgene-free biPSCs.",
