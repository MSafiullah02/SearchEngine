Ophthalmic clinical reviews are currently classified in the same category as other specialties with minimal levels of personal protective equipment (PPE) advised. These recommendations also apply to prolonged procedures, such as slit-lamp laser treatment [3].",

An 81-year-old gentleman was admitted out-of-hours with suspected orbital cellulitis secondary to facial cellulitis. This necessitated bedside review by the on-call Ophthalmology registrar using a portable slit-lamp and indirect ophthalmoscope at a distance of 13 and 71 cm, respectively. The examination took several minutes to complete due to extensive oedema and patient discomfort. The patient also coughed at several points during the examination. This patient had not been deemed a COVID-19 suspect, nor was he in a high-risk area. At the time of his assessment, guidelines recommended that only a surgical mask and slit-lamp guard for COVID-19 suspected or confirmed cases was required. Public Health England (PHE) and the Royal College of Ophthalmology (RCOphth) now recommend the use of a fluid-resistant type IIR surgical mask, eye protection, disposable gloves, and plastic apron when assessing all patients, regardless of COVID-19 status. However, a recent survey of Ophthalmologist\u2019s reflected anxiety and a lack of confidence concerning COVID-19 exposure risk in an ophthalmic setting [4]. Consequently, standalone eye hospitals introduced PPE standards beyond recommendations from PHE and RCOphth, such as FFP3 respirators for all clinical staff in A&E [4].",
